B003QCCS36|5.0|Pure and simple...this is great classic music from beginning to end. This may be Ray's most consistently good album he's made yet, at least since Trouble. Whereas previous albums had their standout tracks along with others that took awhile to catch on for me, each song on this album takes hold of you, demanding you to listen until before you know it you've listened to the whole album over and over without skipping a track. Right from the start Ray kicks it off with a funky groovy track like nothing else he's done before called \\"Repo Man.\\" With the Pariah Dogs giving more of a band feel than a producer's influence, you can totally visualize how Repo Man came into being with Ray likely sitting in a room with the Pariah Dogs, sharing that groove on the acoustic guitar and each member jumping into the jam and adding their own parts to make a great rock song. Like most of Rays songs they would probably be just as good or better if it was just Ray and his acoustic. But here, I think the Pariah Dogs really earn their billing without taking away from the essence of the song or overshadowing it. Some of the songs do have a more country lilt to them and normally I cringe over pedal steel guitar (too honky tonk for me) but here its very tastefully done and, dare I say, lovely. The production is great and doesn't stray much from the straight forward band lineup or still stripping it down to Ray and his guitar like on \\"Rock & Roll Radio.\\" I won't knock Ethan Johns production hand in previous releases. He's a great producer and I'm sure he was a big part in casting Ray with horns in some of his soul songs or in more jazzy and pastoral soundscapes. However, I think there was a bit too much production on the last release and overall this album feels more vital, immediate and passionate. Sure there may not be a single song as perfect as \\"Trouble\\" or as catchy as \\"You are the Best Thing.\\" And yes, I always wish Ray would rock out a bit more. But all in all I think this is among Ray'sstrongest batch of great melodies, songwriting and classic sound. Definitely one you'll want to listen over and over from beginning to end for a long time to come.
B000XA5K48|5.0|Just watched this and couldn't stop laughing.    It really isn't a 5-star flick but I wanted to counter balance the 1-star morons that panned it because it wasn't some great drama.  Sometimes a guy just wants to have fun ..... in an ultraviolent sort-of way.
0684853523|5.0|Well written, informative, interesting, inspiring, personable, kind to the would be writer.  I have read books of this sort by other writers and they are usually aloof and pretentious, flat and discouraging .   I honestly feel from reading this book that King is a real flesh and bones human who loves his work and has both respect and compassion for the craft / occupation of writing. He talks about the elusive magic (my words, not his) of inspiration and that need to put in the perspiration. I feel inspired  and encouraged to write with the advice of one who is involved with and  has been successful at writing. I am grateful to Stephen King for this book. Though I have no illusions about becoming a famous writer or even a good writer. What I do feel confident about is that with this book I can improve on what I do now. I like to write so I feel encouraged to have some fun doing what I like to do. This book has quieted  to a large degree, that little voice of discouragement that nags with, \\"whodoyouthinkyou'rekidding, you can't write.\\" Thanks Mr. King.
B003YP0BI4|3.0|The Last Frontier album review    Cover: class cover art, which is almost non-existent now.  Song titles: fairly decent.  I often look at the imagination behind the song titles and I can get a good indication of album quality just from that without ever listening to the first song.    Song quality:  1.Satellite 15...  Interesting but entirely too lengthy, gets boring halfway through its 4 minutes.    2.The Final Frontier  Pretty cool song.  Track one should have been split into separate songs.  In fact that is what I did with Audacity so I don't want to wait through Satellite 15.  The video was a very cool high dollar production.    3.El Dorado  I downloaded this one when it was offered free.  Good riffy song.  Weak pre-chorus but nice chorus.  Verses are lengthy.    4.Mother of Mercy  OK song, nothing special.    5.Coming Home  OK song, nothing special.    6.The Alchemist  One of the better songs.  Expectations are always high when Harris writes songs title \\"The...\\"  They usually become classics like The Trooper, The Clansman.  This one is not as good, however.    7.Isle of Avalon  Three minutes before it really gets moving.  Very progressive sounding.    8.Starblind  An decent riff of a song, not a typical Maiden beat.  Interesting transitions.    9.The Talisman  Starts slow for the first 2 minutes before picking up the Maiden gallop.  Decent Song after that.     10.The Man Who Would Be King  Decent.    11.When The Wild Wind Blows  Really like the intro part of the song and the melody throughout it.    Now, before anyone accuses me of slamming Maiden with the review I want to point out that I have every Maiden album and have been a fan since '88.  This is just not a strong album from them.  Although the songs are not classic Maiden material it is good for playing at work in the background.   Frontier just does not have that great Maiden riffage or guitarmonies.  The songs are too long and wordy when compared to their classic era.  Maiden was in their prime 1983-1988.  Anything from this era is very good stuff.  Then there was the huge leap to Brave New World in 2000, which was quality metal.  Anything else is mediocre.  I think after the success of the Somewhere Back In Time Tour my expectations were higher for a more classic Maiden album.
0061537934|5.0|this was one of the most compelling stories I have ever read!  It's really not about the dog, but how the relationships between the dog and his family affected so many things, and his perspective.  It's really a human story from the dog's perspective; very well written and I couldn't put it down.  I have recommended it to many people as it was recommended to me.
B002RWKSII|5.0|It's all here -- lovely and interesting instrumental arrangements played by one of the best bands in the business, Brian's best vocals in a long time, delightful background vocal arrangements, and an eclectic selection of Gershwin tunes.  There's nothing not to love in this new CD, and it damn well better win a Grammy for something!
B002RWKSII|4.0|Since the success of Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook albums, it has sort of become the norm for older rock icons to record an album of standards.  It would look as Brian Wilson has done the same with his new release Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin.  But if you look at the title, it tells the whole tale.  Unlike his contemporaries who have recorded standard albums with arrangements that are in the classic style, Mr. Wilson has taken selected Gershwin numbers and transformed them by arranging the music and vocals into his classic Beach Boys, sun drenched, warm and lush pop sound.  If you didn't know these were Gershwin tunes, you would have no problem believing that they were originals by Mr. Wilson.  These are all great songs (including two new songs that were uncompleted works that Mr. Wilson finished off) and the way they are interpreted makes them sound fresh.

B002S0OBN2|5.0|I remember purchasing this about two - three weeks back and receiving the notice that the Vocal / Piano book for \\"Love Never Dies\\" would not be in until middle of September! I was disappointed, but told myself that I had normal S&H and I would have to be patient. It was coming from London, I assumed...    And lo and behold! I received my vocal book on 8/16! Not bad at all! The book is in excellent condition and I'm working on the notes for a solo performance now. Great deal and great value, I couldn't be happier!
0143118420|4.0|I'm a little disturbed at the viciousness of some of the negative reviews on here. I found this book to be a really great look inside a very honest woman who's experienced something I believe many people do - a sort of quarter-life crisis where they realize they have all the material trappings of a great life but are miserable in it and can't figure out why. She has the courage (and good fortune) to be able to go on a journey to find what she really wants. I'm a little surprised how many people call this \\"selfish\\" - she is on a quest to seek happiness - isn't that what everyone is doing? (Everyone who is fortunate enough to live a life above poverty, that is - I do realize there are many people simply struggling to survive but I don't think they are the people reading this book.) Which only leads me to believe the people who find this \\"appalling\\" think we should seek only society-accepted forms of making ourselves happy - getting married and having children.    She is a little annoying at times, and I have never quite understood those women who hop from relationship to relationship with no pause, but we all have flaws. Some of you people search for the tiniest little things to fuss about. And you complain that she was paid to write it beforehand? Obviously she was paid to write it, she's a writer. If she had been traveling off inherited money or anything she did not earn herself I can understand your contempt, but she seems like a completely self-made woman who deserves nothing but respect for how hard she's worked and how far she's gotten in life.    Making yourself happy enables you to impart a positive energy into the world and through this, make the world a little bit of a better place. Isn't that the goal of volunteering, of working hard, of creating any kind of art? And that is exactly what she has done here - written a great book that speaks to people possibly going through the same things. I found her struggles with depression and loneliness, her little moments of joy, her heartbreak, her musings on divinity, not only interesting but very relatable. And I'm clearly not the only one - best sellers are best sellers for a reason!

B000W4E3OS|4.0|This is a long overdue review; I have owned this box set for more than a year by now, which is anything but an average one. How often does one come across complete sets that are actually great throughout? When it comes to complete piano sets, I would say that only [[ASIN:B001F4YGUA Ohlsson's complete Chopin survey]] qualifies. But Maria Lettberg's 'complete' (the posthumously published works are sadly not included) Scriabin survey comes very close.<br /><br />By the way, who is Maria Lettberg? Well, before I saw her name mentioned in Dace Gisclard's uncommonly thoughtful Scriabin reviews (thank you kindly, Dace!), I had never heard of her--in spite of sharing her Swedish nationality. Ms Lettberg was born in Riga, studied in Stockholm, Helsinki and St Petersburg, is a Swedish citizen, and now resides in Berlin; she did her doctoral thesis on Scriabin.<br /><br />So, what makes this set all that special? (1) Scriabin is the only true heir of Chopin, in the sense that his piano music not only derives from the piano but also extends and redefines the scope of the very instrument--indeed, more of an acquired taste due to its vast idiosyncrasies but possibly even more addictive; (2) there has only been one complete recorded set of Scriabin's piano music, by [[ASIN:B00007J4SI Michael Ponti on Vox]]--which is pianistically quite good, if unfinished, but sonically one of the greatest disasters of the stereo era; (3) Scriabin's music is not only a great challenge for the listener but even more so for the performer--calling for a combination of spectacular technique, refined tone, meticulous preparation, olympic stamina, ecstatic intensity as well as a nervously passionate persona; (4) Lettberg delivers in spades on most counts throughout this set--she evidently has a unusually well developed sense of how to penetrate and bring to life Scriabin's highly intricate writing; (5) recorded and issued by the provincial Austrian Capriccio label, this set is bound to remain in the periphery of the densely congested market of recorded music, despite favourable reviews in the Gramophone ('This is an invaluable issue and a formidable achievement finely recorded', Bryce Morrison), Fanfare and MusicWeb International (including a Recording-of-the-Month accolade)--meaning any additional exposure is as needed as it is well-deserved.<br /><br />Let's have a closer look at the 9 discs--8 CDs and 1 DVD:<br /><br />Discs #1-2 cover the 10 Sonatas, where Lettberg is up against some great pianists. Her technique is secure, on par with Ponti, Szidon, Ogdon, Taub and Laredo, but slightly below that of Austbo, Glemser, Sudbin and Ashkenazy; Hamelin remains in a class of his own--unrivalled in the 1st/III, 4th/II, 6th, 8th and 10th Sonatas. Lettberg's greatest strengths are her singing tone, lyrical sensitivity, passionate temperament, meticulous preparation and beautiful inner voices--which render the perhaps most overall satisfying reading of the 1st ('I played Scriabin's Sonata No 1 and if felt like my own skin', as she put it in the Gramophone interview, May 2008), a darkly passionate 2nd, a gorgeously intimate 3rd, an appropriately volatile 4th, a frighteningly austere 6th, and a rather volcanic 9th. Hence, she is more successful in the post-Chopinesque Scriabin than in the pre-avant-garde ditto--something that, however, is only true as far as the Sonatas are concerned. The general problem I have with her take on the five late Sonatas is that she tends to lose herself in the mysteriously luxurious textures, either being lethargic sacrificing momentum and intensity (7th, 10th), and/or using excess sustain pedal (to smoothen over technical glitches in the fiendish 8th). Nonetheless, this is the greatest complete reading of the 10 Sonatas after Hamelin's super-human traversal. ****<br /><br />Discs #3-4 comprise the 83 Preludes that are divided into 15 suites of 2-24 pieces (another 7 Preludes can be found embedded in the 'Morceaux' collections as well as in Op9 for the left hand). Here is where Lettberg is at her absolute best; I would venture to say that she gives us the greatest survey of Scriabin's Preludes by a good margin! The main reason being her unusual ability to find the essence of each and every Prelude to render them as individual masterpieces; Ponti, Lane and Zarafiants sound markedly generic by comparison. Granted, despite an overall high musical quality, the Preludes display a significant variance: the 24 Preludes of Op 11 in all the keys are easily the greatest sequel to Chopin's seminal Op 28; Opp 67 & 74 are amongst the last works Scriabin wrote and offer a fascinating view on the apex of his piano writing; there are also a number of largely unknown treasures to be discovered in Opp 16/1, 17/3, 22/1, 27/2, 31/1, 39/3 and 48/2. *****<br /><br />Disc #5 contains the complete Etudes, save those three pieces embedded in the 'Morceaux' collections of Opp 2, 49 and 56. Scriabin's Etudes are surely difficult to play, in the densely polyphonic sense &agrave; la Rachmaninov, if still human as opposed to those of Godowsky and Sorabji. Lettberg is good throughout on most counts--even occasionally resembling some Horowitzian nervousness. She is particularly good in the stormy triplets of Op 8/3, the fury double-octaves of Op 8/9, the cruel cross-rhythms of Op 42/1, as well as the unleashed vehemence in Op 65/3. Regrettably, my personal favourite, Op 42/6, comes out somewhat unarticulated and blurry. ****<br /><br />Disc #6's 21 Mazurkas make up the greatest pieces written in the genre, second only to their models set down by Chopin some half-a-century earlier. As with the Preludes, Lettberg's greatest contribution is to bring out the individuality of each piece--turning Op 3/5 and Op 3/10 into nostalgic masterworks, whereas Op 3/6, Op 25/4 and Op 40/2 glisten like pearls. Even if her collected achievement in the Mazurkas and Waltzes are likely to remain unsurpassed for some time to come, [[ASIN:B000WH5AYC Yevgeny Sudbin's]] performances of Op 3 Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 rise to another level of extraordinarily intense refinement--especially so in the greatest Waltz ever written for the piano, in A-flat major, Op 38. ****(+)<br /><br />On disc #7, the Impromptus and Poems are fittingly juxtaposed. In spite of Lettberg's excellent playing, I only feel strongly for the Impromptus of Op 12/2 and Op 14/2--the rest are as close to salon music as Scriabin ever came. However, the Poem genre, which I believe Scriabin invented as far as the piano is concerned, contains some of his greatest compositions: the hallucinatory Op 32 is done with an ideal combination of poise and fire, whereas the Po&egrave;m tragique and Po&egrave;m-Nocturne are both splendidly evocative. Alas, the greatest of them all, Vers la flamme, is too comfortably beautiful, lacking that ecstatic intensity of which the score is filled to its brim. ****<br /><br />The last 'music' disc, #8, provides an appealing traversal of some larger free-standing works and seven collections entitled Morceaux, most of which belong to Scriabin's late style. Notwithstanding that Lettberg's Op 9 for the left hand is gorgeous and that her B-minor Fantaisie simmers of nervous passion, what is remarkable about this disc is her realisation of some of Scriabin's most original and intoxicating music. As fascinating as the last five Sonatas are, these Morceaux make up something of an amalgamation of early avant-garde and jazz, impressionism and expressionism, spiced with those unique Scriabinian sonorities. Again, her understanding of Scriabin's extreme idiosyncrasies is second to none: Marvellous! *****<br /><br />Finally, there is the bonus DVD, #9, where Lettberg plays excerpts from the 4th, 5th, 6th, 9th, and 10th Sonatas and Vers la flamme, as well as discusses Scriabin's music and 'Mysterium'--a multi-media project in the spirit of Scriabin's planned, terminal 'Arcanum'. It is indeed rewarding to see Ms Lettberg play the Sonata excerpts on a white B&ouml;sendorfer; however, I am not sure that Andreas Schmidt's synaesthetic contributions add value, although Vers la flamme's fiery colour cascade is rather beautiful. Here as throughout the box set, the recorded sound is very good, caught at Deutschlandradio Kultur and the Siemensvilla in Berlin between March 2004 and June 2007; it is only during some of the Etudes, Mazurkas and Poems recorded at the Siemensvilla that the sound can turn clangy in loud passages. ***(+)<br /><br />To wrap up an already too lengthy review, I would like to quote Peter J. Rabinowitz's apt words from the Nov/Dec 2008 issue of Fanfare: 'These are, for the most part, big, assertive performances, featuring a dark bass-centered tone, a confident technique, a huge dynamic range (superbly captured by the engineers), and a highly dramatic interpretive outlook anchored in a keen sense of the turbulence of Scriabin's textural conflicts. [...] This is Scriabin without apology.'<br /><br />As Ms Lettberg writes on her website, 'More than three years of work in a box' ([...]). As true as that is, I believe the collective number of years of enjoyment for us listeners is literally immeasurable...

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I agree with the five star reviews - one of the best horror fantasies of the last three decades, no exaggeration. Let the Right One In is also one of the very few exceptional vampire movies, and the only one I have seen which truly moved me. Depending upon your interpretation of the vampire character and her motives, the film could be viewed as a quietly sweet love story (though also secret and dark), but don't let that throw you if you ordinarily don't like such flicks - it is also most definitely a horror movie. The title of the film speaks to the classic vampire lore at the heart of the plot - vampires can't enter your abode unless invited - but also underscores the poignant emotional themes of the film; for example, the risk of pain and loss which is always associated with letting people into our lives and our hearts. At the same time, I see the title as reflecting the ambiguity of the characters, which upon reflection are more complex and open to interpretation than one might at first think. It is something of a cinematic miracle that Tomas Alfredson and writer John Ajvide Lindqvist (who adapted his own novel for the film) manage to weave together sweet romanticism with all out horror in a way which compliments both moods, while also leaving the characters open to interpretation in a manner which does not frustrate, but rather enriches the experience. Let the Right One In is an amazing achievement which any fan of horror fantasy, vampire lore, complex character studies, or indeed romantic films will not want to miss.

Wait until you hear #7 S'Wonderful . . . every Wilson arrangement of every Gershwin song is uniquely belonging to that song . . . every sound is a new sound.     This will have to be a hit for Wilson and now I can't wait to see what Brian will do next.  Hopefully?

B003JTHETY|5.0|Prepare to be surprised by this album. It is very different from their latest album (AMOLAD). AMOLAD was a very dark and heavy album. In fact, AMOLAD had some of the heaviest maiden songs of all time, like Brighter than a thousand songs. At times, The Final Frontier is reminiscent of X-Factor, Brave New World and Dance of Death.     Fast catchy songs: Final Frontier, El Dorado, The Alchemist. The latter could have been included in Powerslave. El Dorado is probably the weakest.     More experimental: Starblind and Man that Would be King. These songs will surprise some fans. MTWBK has so many twists and turns. At times it is melodic, at times it doesn't sound like metal at all. Yes, Maiden still sounds like Maiden, but these tunes are proof of Maidens creative talent.    Power ballad: Coming Home. Yes Maiden recorded a power ballad, and it is actually amazing. One of the best songs in the album.     Long Epics: When the Wild Wind Blows, Isle of Avalon, The Talisman. This is where the album really shines. Yes, these songs are long, but they are not slow or boring. The middle section in Isle of Avalon is pretty progressive. When the Wild Wind Blows sounds like X-Factor at times.     At the end of the day, the album is EPIC, but some may not like the fact that the album is more \\"mellow\\" / less heavy than previous Maiden albums. Also, some of the more experimental songs like The Man that Would be King may not sit well with some older fans.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I love were the writer took this movie. It is but it isn't your classic Trek.
B003JTHESA|5.0|For me, Final Frontier has been the hardest Iron Maiden album for me to review, but after listening to it several times I believe it to be Iron's best one since Fear Of The Dark. It is a refreshing and creative album, that combines a lot of the Brave New World energy with the AMOLAD's proginess, and where Maiden was able to overcome some of the previous albums shortcomings, most notably not having the endless lyrics repetitions (16 x Your Time Will Come ohohohoh) and the excessive slow pointless passages in the middle. The solos and vocal lines are oftem very inspired and definitely the album does not keep repeating old things but look forward. It's no new Piece Of Mind, but it's living proof that Maiden still can create top notch music that very few bands today can even think of.    So, why was it so hard to review? First, the album consists of two very different parts that sounds a lot like two EPs in a single disc. The five initial songs are more \\"direct\\", shorter and have several pre-X-Factor era touchs, while the last five songs are the very prog songs Maiden has been doing since The X-Factor, with a lot of AMOLAD influence and that require careful and multiple auditions. Second, Maiden definitely was in the mood to experiment, with riffs, vocals, rythm breaks that are new to the band and keep you thinking for a while. Third is Kevin Shirley, whose production once again kills some punch and bury Bruce's voice behind the instruments. To be honest, Bruce's voice is suffering in a few more demanding parts. Nevertheless, Shirley has to go as the rougher versions of The Final Frontier and El Dorado actually sound better than the album ones. Finally, regardless of Maiden being better than practically any other current band, any new Maiden song will be compared to old Maiden songs, which is like starting a race 20 laps behind.    Song by song review:    Satellite 15....The Final Frontier actually consists of two songs. Sattelite 15 is a 4-minute intro, with apocalyptic guitars and sounds and tribal drums. It starts well, with a crescendo but just when you expect a heavy riff, it just sticks for more 2 minutes... But when The Final frontier enters, it's that usual Maiden short opener, a blend of The Wickerman and Different Worlds, with great Adriam and Dave solos and a chorus that Bruce delivers with excelence.    El Dorado is in my point of view one of the best songs. Lots of punch, galloping bass, guitars alternating between riffs a la Barracuda from Heart and melodic bridges, Bruce narrating the catchy lyrics before air raid sirem chorus, and guitar solos that bring the 80's classics.    Mother of Mercy is a great Oh My God What Have I Done war AMOLAD song, that starts almost acoustic and grows into a very dense dark song that could be well into Fear Of The Dark for the guitars. The base guitar layers are top notch as are the lyrics, but Bruce's voice here suffers a little bit.    Coming Home is a balad that could be in any Bruce Dickinson solo disc, like a blend of Tears Of The Dragon, Wasting Love and Out of the Shadows. It's actually very good, but in a live show might kill the flame a little bit.    The Alchemist should be in Killers or Powerslave, one of those fast, short, melodic, old school, almost naive 80's metal songs. At first it did not impress me, but the vibe here is great. Perfect to be played in those small metal clubs with fans banging heads and doings air guitars...    Isle of Avalon starts the prog half of the album with a slow, long crescendo bass and vocal part that reminds me of the Rime of The Ancient Mariner mid-section, exploding after near 3 minutes into a great riff and chorus. What prevents this song to becoming a classic is Bruce's voice and some interruptions like the prog passage a la Pink Floyd / Dream Theater and the back to Rime of The Ancient Mariner bass / vocal lines in the middle.    Starblind is for me the least good song in the album, but that may be the one that requires the most auditions to appreciate. 1-minute slow star followed by riffs, vocal lines and choruses that are new to Maiden. It could improve with more punch because it's based on heavy riffs, angry vocals and some interesting breaks.    The Talisman is one of the best. 2 minutes of acoustic slow intro like The Legacy precedes a great song based on riffs like Ghost Of The Navigator, outstanding vocal lines, likely the best chorus in the whole album and catchy guitar melodies bridging the different parts. Awesome and 9 minutes that will fly by. If Bruce's voice was like in the 80's...    The Man Who Would is another song that stars with a 2 minutes slow acoustic / vocal parts, but after it is a song that could easily be in Fear Of The Dark, like a mix of Fear Is The Key, The Fugitive and Judas My Guide. Except for the mid-section prog parts in the middle a la AMOLAD meets Dance Of Death. It's an enjoyable song that like Starblind would benefit hugely from some punch.    When The Wild Wind Blows is CLASSIC, the best Maiden song since Fear Of The Dark, ABSOLUTELY AWESOME. It's totally a prog new Maiden song, but it has one of the best melody lines I have ever seen, just sticks in your head on and on. Lyrics are outstanding and the song effortlessly and perfectly grows from part to part. No part, vocal line or guitar has a single note more than what's necessary for greatness. Base guitars keep revving up while the lead guitar sounds like a regent leading Bruce's vocal orchestra, and both taking your emotions up and down as you listen to it. If the 5 prog songs in Final Frontier were like this one, this would be a new Seventh Son...    Thus, if you cannot adjust your expectations and appreciate what Maiden still has to offer, just buy last tour's DVD or go watch old metal bands on The History Channel. Because although not perfect, current Iron Maiden still can be creative, write great songs and not repeat themselves on and on. Long Live the Irons and let's hope this is not Maiden's final frontier. Can't wait for the tour...
B002AT4K9Q|4.0|This was a good flick, the best one since the first film.  They had Vins deductive skills supped up more than the cars.
B00009V7P8|1.0|The one star isn't for Damien Rice, because I am familiar with his music and I enjoy it very much. This item was supposed to be a gift but it never arrived at its destination. I have given the shipment an ample amount of time to get there but after almost a month it is still in limbo. What makes it worse is that Amazon.com doesn't give you any real recourse for such a situation. I tried navigating all the areas in \\"my account\\", and there is no section that deals with lost goods.
B002RSDW80|5.0|[[ASIN:B002RSDW80 Julie & Julia]] I read the book which I didn't like then saw the movie which I thought was wonderful. Then again anything with Meryl Streep is wonderful. I would recommend the movie over the book to anyone.
B003G4IXA6|5.0|I'm 51, a GnR Fan. This LP has a different Lead Singer on each track. Slash is diverse and unequalled.  Find Slashs Snake Pit on CD from 1995 also. It is amazing.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|When I saw previews for this film in the theatre, by wife and I exchanged eye-rolls.  So when I borrowed a friend's copy out of sheer boredom with the current panoply of predictable, music video children's films, my expectations were low.  In fact, we began this film close to the kid's bedtime so I'd have a reasonable excuse to bail out early.<br /><br />Well, the kids loved this movie and so did I.  It's wonderfully paced, the animal characters are idiosyncratic and immensely likable, and the dialogue is conversational and amusing.  I don't like when an animated children's film includes a stratum of adult innuendo.  That, to me, is targeted marketing, and those carefully distributed oblique references that make mom and dad chuckle exist to compensate for a weak story.  No gimmicks here.  Funny situations, cleverly crafted characters, technically superb animation, and a novel story.<br /><br />We've must've seen it 10x since that first night.  Any other film and I would have accidentally lost the video by now.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|As a fan of LaMontagne's previous work, I had fairly high expectations and hopes for his latest release and I'm happy to say that it hasn't disappointed.  \\"God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise\\" delivers - it's a fantastic mix of funk (Repo Man), blues (Devil's in the Jukebox), and Ray's own unique alt-folk sound.  It's the type of music you can listen to and enjoy regardless of your mood.    In my opinion, LaMontagne's work just gets better with each album that he's done.  Not a bad trajectory when you started with albums like \\"Trouble\\" and \\"When the Sun Turns Black\\".    This CD won't disappoint, get it and enjoy
B003LAH7MU|5.0|I'm eating up this record. Play it over and over. In that rare class of current song sets that I need to hear fully front to back every couple of days. Sometimes on shuffle. Now that you mention it in fact I believe it's time to play it again.    My only smallish gripe, apropos of the title, is I'd've liked to hear a full orchestral attack on 'Synchronicity I' somehow. Has to be some kind of transporting way to arrange it. Maybe someday.    In general this sort of elaboration of previous inspiration seems entirely valid & healthy and I was hoping to see more of it attempted. All the grousing around here can only have made that slightly less likely if anything so let me ask again: What's the deal with you crabapples?
B0006IIKS0|4.0|***Before I say anything derogatory about Metallica in this review, I'd like to point out that I will always consider myself a die-hard Metallica fan. I have a few things negative things to say about the guys in the band in this review, so I wanted to make sure that before you read further, you know that I AM a huge Metallica fan. This film just happens to center around the making of my least favorite album from Metallica (St. Anger), and after watching this film yourself, I think you'll understand why I'm about to say these few things. Now, onto the film...<br /><br />This movie would've been REALLY good if it documented any other period of Metallica's existence. I was excited about this movie because I have enjoyed Joe Berlinger & Bruce Sinofsky's previous films (\\"Paradise Lost\\", \\"Brother's Keeper\\"), and I've been a fan of Metallica since I was a little kid.  The movie is compelling and offers great access to the creative process that went into Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\", which I believe is their worst album. I was very disappointed with \\"St. Anger\\", since it was hyped as a return to Metallica's metal roots and turned out to be, well, not good at all. After watching this film, I can see why the finished product \\"St. Anger\\" was a disappointment... The band is in peril throughout the movie. Personal relationships between band members are at an all-time low. The album's heavily criticized production is explained by producer Bob Rock as sounding \\"like a garage band, only the band is Metallica.\\" The band seeks answers from a therapist, a producer, and themselves, without ever finding any.<br /><br />The filmmakers made the best documentary they could make with the material they had to work with, that is, a band that is no longer hungry, and making music that isn't up to par. So the film really centers around the struggle within (no pun intended) the band. The film documents the faltering relationships between the band members, and it's often painful to watch, especially for a Metallica fan. We see a clashing of egos (particularly Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield) that is truly sickening to watch.  The band comes off as egotistical, unreasonable, and irritable, with a rather high opinion of themselves.  The frustration mounts throughout the movie as we have to deal with Lars, who really reveals himself to be a vain, obnoxious and temperamental person who, although irritating, unfortunately cannot be done without.<br /><br />Some of the better parts of the film include James Hetfield's entering rehab and the obstacles his newfound sobriety brought to the table, as well as several bass player auditions from famous hard rock and metal bassists such as: Danny Lohner of Nine Inch Nails, Jeordie White (a.k.a Twiggy Ramirez) of Marilyn Manson, A Perfect Circle, Nine Inch Nails & Goon Moon, Pepper Keenan of Corrosion Of Conformity, Scott Reeder of Kyuss, Chris Wyse of The Cult, Eric Avery Of Jane's Addiction, and Robert Trujillo of Ozzy Osbourne and Suicidal Tendencies. Another high point in the film is footage of when the band performs a live show at San Quentin prison for the prisoners.  Other highlights include interviews and confrontations between estranged ex-Metallica members Dave Mustaine (of Megadeth) and Jason Newsted, as well as a portion of the film which addresses the famous Metallica vs. Napster battle.<br /><br />I like the movie, I give it 3.5 stars. It's just frustrating to watch the band members hit rock bottom like they do in the film. Every band has ups and downs, and this film documents the lowest point in Metallica's career (if you ask me, anyways...).  Definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of Metallica and/or documentary films.We see a clashing of egos (particularly Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield) that is truly sickening to watch.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|The book is what I was looking for when I heard about it.  The journey that the author goes on is one that many people can relate to and take away different meanings from also.  The tale is from one perspective and does not make recommendations for other people's lives.  The journey is one that many would like to go on and this book allows them to live vicariously through the author.  I liked that she did not speak much about her husband and admitted her personality flaws as a badge of change she wanted to move forward through with strength and new goals.  I liked that we as the readers got to experience the journey from the pivotal events that started the journey until the end of the one year time scale.  In my opinion a great empowering story. I will read this book periodically to see what other roads I should consider that otherwise I would not have thought possible previously.
B000002I4S|2.0|I'm a fan of progressive rock and classical music of the baroque period, both of which tend to cultivate mastubatory solos. I'm used to it and, usually, I like it. I bought this after listening to numerous recommendations from fellow musicians over the last few decades. I just don't get what the big deal is. In his autobigraphy, Andy Summers (of Police fame) explained that he hated Coltrane the first time he heard him, but was continually drawn back, eventually came to love the music, and now regards it as highly influential in his own development. I wish my experience was the same. I've forced myself to listen to this over and over. But, for me, the soloing that pervades this recording approaches randomness.
0470876417|5.0|Many, many, companies are still in a comfort zone where everything is gray and square. In this way people in business feel just as objects remunerated.     Creativity is just a speech to executives and partners to nurture the spirits of employees and to show the market they are people who care about the others not only about profits. There is little action and lots of lies and deception whose result is monotony.    We need to break the barriers of corporate myopic vision and operating small revolutions that we can really make a qualitative leap in our lives and, therefore, in our relations.

0307269752|1.0|Stars slowly, ends painfully slowly...there is no real \\"plot\\" to speak of...it actually reads like a textbook, as others have pointed out. Just awful considering the hype.<br /><br />I don't get Henning Mankel either, so it's fair to say I'm done with Swedish crime novels!<br /><br />If you want dark thriller to read, pick up anything by Thomas Harris written before \\"Hannibal\\". He is a master of characterization and plot.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|Both above reviews are right on. Both this EMI set and the DG compilation are admirable in almost every respect and any complete \\"Mahlerite\\" will probably want both sets, regardless of whether or not they have most of the recordings in other sets or configurations.    Is every recording my most-favorite of each work? Certainly not! But I am sure neither company could secure(or wanted to)the rights to Walter's magnificent 1938 Ninth with Vienna. Perhaps the Klemperer over the Barbirolli in the Ninth? But no disputing Barbirolli's Sixth is stupendous, to say the least. Klemperer's Fourth with Schwarzkopf would have been nice..... see what I mean? Joys and small disappointments in both EMI and DG sets, but this is quibbling. Why not buy them both?    Here's something no one can quibble over; this EMI set has the incomparable \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\\" cycle with Fischer-Dieskau/Schwarzkopf and Szell. Worth the price by itself, hands down. Thanks, EMI. Add this keeper to your collection. A great set at a great price!  Scott
B003JTHESA|5.0|As some the other reviewers have noted , this isn't the old formula Maiden , I  loved that but I really like the new sound of TFF . When The Wild Wind Blows , El Dorado , The Talisman , Coming Home - how can you go wrong ? I love the guitars , Nicko bashing away & Bruce hasn't lost a thing with his voice . I really liked the short tour swing in North America prior to this release and it was great hearing a lot of deep cuts instead of Run To The Hills for the 1,000,000th time , thank God that was left out of the setlist ! Up The Irons !
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Beautiful film. Like another reviewer here, I could have watched for another hour or two to see more history like this come to the screen. I was surprised to read so many reviews that seemed to think the movie made the Christians out to be the bad guys. What I saw happening was what was going historically at the time and with which, in one introductory line, the movie began: (paraphrased)\\"Jews and Christians came into town and the trouble began.\\"      The history is so interesting and so relevant to what we are seeing today. It's a shame so many seem to have missed this in the movie and saw the problem as being with \\"the Christians\\" or with Christianity--there was after all a brutal massacre of the Christians by the Jews depicted in the film as well. A better conclusion might be that if there is a problem with religion perhaps it is more specifically with Middle Eastern/Abrahamic religion--Judaism, Christianity, Islam. Isn't it these three that have been at root of the most religious strife in history (starting all the way back with the occupation and genocide of and in Canaan, if you believe the Tanack/Old Testament stories?)     There is so much historically of interest in this film to the history buffs out there, but much is no doubt lost to the average viewer who probably just buys into(or argues against) the \\"Christians is bad\\", or \\"religion is bad, in general\\" perceived storyline. My hope is that perhaps interest has been sparked among individuals who have seen the movie and who will then go on to want to learn more, and that more films like \\"Agora\\" will be made. This is a movie I know I will want to see again and again to mine the depths of the historical record portrayed. Left me wanting more.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|First I would like to say that Ugly Betty is probably the only tv show that I really loved.  I love these characters and I love the atmosphere that they're in.  And even if the show took a little dip in quality in season 3, it's still as lovable and heartwarming as it always has been.  Now, the show that changed the face of television is now coming to an end.  In this fourth and final season, we find Betty now getting closer and closer to her dreams as everything concludes where all plots are resolved and characters get their just desserts.  The show ended at the perfect time and I'm glad that I found a truely great show to entertain me every Thursday and Friday night for 4 years.  We could all learn something from Betty.  Even though it kills me to see her go, she'll always have a certain place in my heart.  The only thing I would have inproved on is the last episode. They didn't give it the proper treatment it deserved and it could have been better, but other then that, a great show and even better box-set.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|This album is stunning. In my opinion it is a must buy.    Pros:  >Excellent arrangement with absolutely stunning dynamic control.  >Masterful recording, mixing and mastering. One of the best sounding classical CDs I own.  >The accompanying ensemble is TOP NOTCH!  >Yo-Yo was just having a really good day and you can feel his emotion in the music. I know that isn't a quantitative argument, but it is true.    Cons:  I thought about this for a while and all I could come up with is maybe it is missing a solo track?  Really I can't come up with anything bad about it.
B00364K6YW|1.0|On July 16th I ordered my favorite movie, Pride and Prejudice, however when I sat down to watch it low and behold one third of the movie was missing.  Now I'm attempting to return it using the \\"easy return policy\\" but I can't return it because it has been opened.  What would you suggest I do to get the omitted portion of the movie.  Also, how about a return of the overcharge, I paid $28.49 for a partial movie that you are now selling for $19.49.     Review of what I saw of the movie, excellent.      Review of Amazon.com unethical customer service.  You know what you have to do to clear your reputation with me.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Having been a Brian Wilson fan since the earliest days of the Beach Boys, there has always been, in my view, a Gershwin-like flavor to his melodies.  This is particularly true of the songs in his \\"Smile\\" album, such as \\"Heroes and Villains\\" and \\"Cabinessence.\\"  So, while this album came as a surprise to me when I first heard about it, after a moment's thought it seemed like the most logical thing in the world.  The album is fabulous--Brian's voice is the sweetest it has been in years and his incredible band does lovely background vocals and spot-on instrumentation.  It's interesting to hear the variety of musical styles he puts into these songs, ranging from traditional pop to bossa nova to doo-wop to surf-style rockers.  What a marvelous thing it is that the Gershwin Estate allowed Brian to complete two unfinished songs--\\"Nothing but Love\\" is a standout.  Worth the price of the album alone: \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\" introduction and reprise with Brian's incomparable harmonies.  George Gershwin would be proud.
B003JTHESA|1.0|The difference between \\"A Matter of Life & Death\\" and \\"The Final Frontier\\" is that \\"Life & Death\\" pushed back the boundaries whereas \\"Frontier\\" starts completely off the map, in some weird unknown country, and never lays down any boundaries at all. What this free-form nonsense is, or was meant to be, I cannot guess. But it doesn't sound like Iron Maiden to me. The joy, energy, passion and sense of commitment - present on even their weakest albums - is completely missing from this gross display of self indulgence. If you've ever wondered what Maiden would sound like if they decided to become a psychedelic jam band - then this one's for you! It makes no sense to me. The \\"songs\\" are dreary, murky and lifeless. Songwriting takes a backseat (it is actually riding in another car entirely, I think) to cold technical workouts and retro seventies blues guitar jams. The ghosts of Wishbone Ash and Iron Butterfly loom large and mysteriously over this bizarre collection of tracks. Formless and pointless, it stutters on until it simply stops. There is no arc, no apparent purpose. The lyrics hit an all time low, rivaling the doggerel of \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" and \\"Virtual XI\\". I stand in the minority of long time fans for firmly believing that \\"Life & Death\\" is the best album Maiden has ever recorded. I'll go on record as believing that \\"Final Frontier\\" is their absolute worst. Here's hoping we see return to the energy, passion and focus of the true Iron Maiden. In fact, as I listened to it, I could not stop myself from thinking of \\"Spinal Tap\\".
B003JTHESA|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I did NOT like this album very much the first time I heard it.  The songs are long, very progressive, and not as straight-up \\"metal\\" as classic Maiden.  But let me tell you that this album grew on me with each listen, and now, after about 5 or 6 listens...it is AMAZING!  There are just so many great melodies all over this album, and the guitar solos are the best in a long time.<br /><br />Stylistically, I would say this album does sound like a natural progression of all the \\"reunion\\" era albums (Brave New World and later), but also with hints of Somewhere In Time/Seventh Son era Maiden, and even a bit of Chemical Wedding/Tyranny of Souls era Bruce Dickinson solo material (especially Satellite 15 and Coming Home).  One of my favorite things about The Final Frontier is that it brings back some of the '80s era clean guitar tone that is instantly recognizable from songs like Alexander the Great, and Infinite Dreams, that we really haven't heard much of since then.  Also, Maiden has really relegated the harmony lead guitars to the background since The X-Factor, but with this album they are back a bit more prominently.<br /><br />You have to go into this album with an open mind.  Maiden is no longer just a metal band.  They are a progressive metal band.  The days of Powerslave are long gone.  The songs are longer, more complicated, and less instantly catchy.  But if you are willing to accept all of that, and put in your time to listen to this album several times carefully (preferably at full blast), there is MUCH to love here!<br /><br />Finally, I have to get this off my chest.  Maiden is now more than ever a thinking man's band.  They are and have always been a mix of British rock, metal, and prog.  They do not fit neatly into the narrow niche that \\"metal\\" has become over the years.  Yes, they are still heavy a lot of the time, but they are also doing rock and folk influenced parts, drawing on influences like The Who, Wishbone Ash, andUFO.  I bet a lot of the people slagging this album have never listened to those bands.  I think a lot of the backlash against their recent stuff is from narrow minded metal heads who just want everything to be heavy and fast, and can't appreciate slower, lighter, more thoughtful material.  If you like to hang out in a wife beater, you probably will not like this album.  If you think it's cool to pound a bunch of cheap canned beer and then crush the cans on your forehead, look elsewhere.  But if you actually appreciate GREAT MUSIC, whether it is heavy or not, then Maiden is still one of the greatest bands in the world and you will probably love this album!
B003CFBQBW|3.0|I bought this cd mainly because I'm a huge fan and most the movie music grows on me, however, for this soundtrack, I only found 1 or 2 songs appealing unlike the first 2 cd's.

B003JTHETY|2.0|This review is not about the album itself (I thought it was very good), but about the actual product. Most of music newspapers, magazines, sites, and so on reviewed the album already (with positive result), so, no point of rewriting them.<br /><br />Before I start, the rumors have it that it might be the band's last album, so I expected an extra treatment. The metal case with a little window is pretty neat. Upon opening it, I expected 2 CDs, the album and the bonus DVD, like A Matter of Life and Death for example. There was only one CD. I thought that maybe it's all there then. No, just the album. For bonus you go to their site, it verifies that you have this CD inserted and then gives you access to perhaps the crapiest bonus material I have ever seen.<br /><br />Final Frontier (The Director's Cut) has been available through YouTube for some time now, in better quality.<br />Final Frontier Mission Debrief has even worst quality than the first video.<br />Pictures, barely any, and they are not that good either, especially at such low resolution.<br />Game, something I don't care about.<br />Wallpaper. Really wanted that, to find a good wallpaper with the actual band is literally impossible. There are none. Absolute crap. Most of it is just snapshots from the video. There are few wallpapers that stand out from photography perspective, but none with the band itself.<br /><br />The only reason to buy this edition over regular one is the reason such as 'why not? It's just $2 more'. Don't buy it expecting an actual Deluxe Edition, besides the metal case, which is pretty cool I admit, this version has nothing else to offer.<br /><br />Also, I am sure that in a few months they will wrap up that bonus website leaving us with no bonus at all.

0061438294|5.0|Great summary of major research into body language, facial expression, and non-verbal communication behaviors. I use this book as a reading supplement in professional negotiation seminars I run. It really reinforces the value of having someone on your negotiation team who can pay attention to the details in the non-verbal behaviors.
0143118420|5.0|Ordered this book that all my friends are talking about, now the movie is out but I want to read the book before I see the movie so that all the pieces are known because we all know they have to cut out somethings to make the movie length fit.   The seller of this book mailed it right to me very quickly and I have started reading and the book is truly awesome.    I will pass it on afterwards.
B000002H6C|5.0|Growing up this was my favourite Metallica album until I realized that Master of Puppets is their best album ever, and that is now my favourite. But And Justice for All is phenomenal. And other than the crappy production values on this album, its awesome.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Finally a return to form. Great songs. However, a couple aren't as good as they could be. Also, the sound levels were mastered much higher than they should have been leading to clipping and that makes the audio sound a little overdriven. Overlooking that, its awesome.
1594202559|5.0|A very well-written and throughly researched work, which debunks some myths (hedge funds don't outperform the market! Soros won the battle with the Bank of England singlehanded!), and points out the absurdity of the efficient markets hypothesis (by the way, the reviewers who say that \\"Warren Buffett proved that\\" are confused -- Warren could well be the coin-tossing orangutan, plus he manages his companies, and doesn't just hold stock in them, so is not playing the same game). The efficient market hypothesis is really the idiot's (in this case \\"the economist's\\") version of the second law of thermodynamics, the idiot/economist apparently incapable of understanding that systems TEND to an equilibrium, but that does not mean they are perpetually IN equilibrium.<br /><br />For people interested in finance, the book is very informative, though some of the information can be found verbatim in other books (the author is very scrupulous about attribution), and people interested in John Paulson's activity are better off reading [[ASIN:0385529910 The Greatest Trade Ever: The Behind-the-Scenes Story of How John Paulson Defied Wall Street and Made Financial History]]. No technical information is given on quantitative trading strategies (although the book has more information about Renaissance Medallion's trading than I have seen anywhere else), nor, really, on any other trading strategy, with the notable exception of \\"global macro\\" (as practiced by Soros and Druckenmillier), but since the author works for the Council on Foreign Relations, this is not exactly a shocker.<br /><br />I completely agree with the author that regulation is bad for hedge funds, but then again, I have austrian inclinations, and strongly believe that the current mix of the government providing a safety net for the big banks in return for imposing a heavy regulatory burden and permitting them to be grotesquely overleveraged is what is really toxic about the current environment. Unfortunately, this shows no sign of getting better.better.

B0036EH3X4|1.0|and you knew that you were going to have to pull some stuff out of your...notes... to make the last few pages come together? You didn't care. You just knew you had to get something in. Anything. Just as long as you were able to make some semi-coherent attempt to tie it all together.<br /><br />Well, that's Season 6 of Lost. It is completely and indisputably a Hail Mary attempt to wrap up the series. Maybe the network cancelled on the creators at the last minute, maybe they just wanted to just cash in their chips - worth seven figures I'm sure - and buy their own island. Whatever the reason there is zero, ZERO logic to this last season. They chucked all the buildup of the previous seasons out the window in favor of some half-baked Hollywood schmaltz culminating in the last 15 min where they abandon any attempt at resoloution and basically have Christian tell Jack AKA We, the audience that you're never going to get any answers, it was just a fun ride, let it go, bye bye.<br /><br />Without a doubt the biggest let down I have experienced with any kind of television. I will never watch anything those creators make again. And I'm sorry but I understand some folks felt emotionality of the ending was enough for them, which is fine, but PLEASE do not pretend that there was a grand scheme and that season fits in in any way w/ the previous ones. There is zero logic that will make that argument work.<br /><br />P.S - I have just finished reading Stephen King's The Stand, which the writers have mentioned as an influence for the show: they're right. There is a heck of a lot of The Stand in terms of themes and character development, and brilliantly done. But there's one thing the Stand has that Lost didn't - a real ending. In fact, you can see exactly where the writers were probably going to take the story if it followed its natural progression. So I still can't help but feel that the plug was pulled on Lost at thge last minute and they scrambled, because if they had use the end of the Stand, including the Epilogue a la MIB and Jacob replacements, Lost would be the classic many of us hoped it would be.the Epilogue a la MIB and Jacob replacements, Lost would be the classic many of us hoped it would be.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put either the Hunger Games or Catching Fire down! I think I read them both in 48 hours. It wasn't as much of a stand-alone as the Hunger Games (the cliffhanger is a killer), so I can't wait for the final book in the trilogy, Mockingjay. I won't provide more details because there are enough that already exist, but I had to give it my \\"5\\"!
B003QCCS36|4.0|Letting Ray LaMontagne transport you has never been easier, and new LP \\"God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise\\" is the reason why. His fourth album release - and the first to have him billed in a band context with the excellent Pariah Dogs - sounds rich, organic and sincere.<br /><br />From the first song to the last the album sounds like the kind of live concert one might stumble upon during a night of bar hopping and count himself especially lucky for having chanced upon.<br /><br />Things are a little changed this time around. The band is front and center in its support of LaMontagne, justifying their co-billing. Furthermore, he has taken over the production helm from Ethan Johns, taking more control over the final product. The result is sonic textures even more mellowed and marinated than before, allowing the songs maximum ability to catch hold and wield an impression upon the listener.<br /><br />Even if LaMontagne hits upon a cliched phrases or idea here and there (\\"New York City's Bringing Me Down\\") it does not detract.<br /><br />In fact, his directness and lack of pretense result in his themes - among them heartbreak (\\"This Love Is Over\\"), self-preservation (\\"Repo Man\\") and breaking free from convention (the husky, awesome \\"Beg Steal or Borrow\\") - coming off with ease and precisely-chiseled grace. This results in a set of a songs that are arresting at first listen.<br /><br />A particular highlight is the sublime, catchy, profoundly beautiful \\"Old Before Your Time,\\" which has such melodic panache it recalls heyday Elton John and Don McLean. It acknowledges the bittersweet reality of the examined life yet remains optimistic and soothing, one of LaMontagne's specialties. The same can be said of \\"For the Summer,\\" which features awesome instrumental breaks.<br /><br />LaMontagne has grown remarkably for an artist only on his fourth studio record. \\"God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise\\" is sure to please fans and earn many converts.
B000BKACO8|5.0|The book was supposed to be a used book and to my surprise it was like brand new, doesn't appear as though anyone turned one page of the book.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I hated this book SO much, and had such a personal/emotional reaction of disgust with the main character - that I cannot let it go!  I won't rehash other reviewers, but essentially this woman needed to get over herself and and simply live her life!  It was difficult to watch this modern quest for enlightenment that was so contrived and in no way achieved.  Her aim at one point is to simply 'let go' and yet she seems to do the opposite.  I put it down about 3/4 a way through in total boredom and disgust.  Don't listen to Oprah, this book sucks!

B003TQKVGU|5.0|This is a totally awesome book! The writer definitely knew his stuff! There is one thing that I'd like to point out though. This book is not to be used as proof against the existence of God. Although it might sound like that is what the writer is saying in between the lines-it is impossible to say, and it is not for me to judge-it is definately not so. In fact, it can be used as a link to God...or Satan. Let me explain what I mean. The subconscious is actually your soul. This book actually says it is. What is described as the infinite intelligence in this book, is in the bible called the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit in turn, is part of the Holy Trinity. (God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit) So, when the book is referring to the subconscious and using it to reach the infinite, what it really means to us Christians is that we are using our soul, which is within our minds, to obtain the Holy Spirit. This is, in essence, God. I have mentioned Satan too. Satan does have powers, and if you use your subconscious mind the wrong way, i.e. think bad thoughts and have the wrong desires, you will gain Satan's form of wisdom, which is not true wisdom at all.
B00000ITOY|5.0|We bought this toy for our 1-year old son at Christmas last year (2009).  He's now 22 months.  This toy has offered fun and learning for different stages throughout the last year.  And it's one of those toys my son keeps going back to over and over.  When he first started playing with it, the challenge was simply for him to get the shapes on the pegs.  Then he began learning the name of the shapes, then he was counting the number of holes in the shapes and now it's the colors of the shapes.  Great investment!  Lots of time spent playing w/ this simple (and simply wonderful) toy.

B003CRM6QO|4.0|The good news is Flash Gordon has never looked or sounded better.  The vivid colors of the brilliant sets and costumes leap from the screen, looking very comic-like without being over-saturated.  And the Queen soundtrack finally has the \\"oomph\\" that has been sorely missing from home video releases.    The bad news is Universal trashed this disc with BD-Live features that make it painful to actually start the film.  I had to disable BD-Live on my player just for this disc because when it's first inserted it tries to download an updated movie preview.  When I tried to skip that process either my player would lock up or it would sit there for a few minutes before proceeding to the menu.    Fortunately disabling BD-Live fixed it and now it gets to the menu much faster.    The other bad news is that many of the extras that were on previous DVD releases are missing here.  Most notably there is no audio commentary.  That's a big omission.      It's a fun film with a great transfer that is unfortunately marred by limited extra features and a horrible loading structure.  Thumbs down to Universal for this one, but thumbs up for Flash.

B003L5LEYW|5.0|Now...... I never review albums, but this one in particular left me slack jawed.    I actually downloaded this album from torrent because I wasn't expecting much, but after listening to Damian/ Nas's rip it fiercely, I instantly head out to my nearest Best-Buy and purchased the full CD.     listened to 'Leaders' on repeat mode last night for an hour. Never have i shed so many tears from such an impacting song.    'Patience' just blew me away. Such high class, such unorthodox/vintage soulful divineness.         Unquestionably the best album of 2010. Stop reading this review and support this album by purchasing it. Don't bother with mainstream garbage like Justin Bieber
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Martin Scorcese's 'Shutter Island' may not be as praised or praiseworthy as his recent film 'The Departed,' but it is nonetheless a successfully tense viewing experience. Leonardo DiCaprio is, as expected (lately), powerful, almost overwhelming, as the tumultuous marshal Teddy Daniels. He has been sent to investigate the disappearance of a woman on an island off Massachusetts that consists solely of a prison for the criminally insane. On the ride over, he meets his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), and at the institute, he encounters a variety of cryptic doctors and disturbed patients.    Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) appears to be a forward thinking psychiatrist, while the German Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) espouses harsher beliefs about the mad. Between unfruitful interviews, Teddy dreams of his dead wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) and recalls the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp, of which the fenced in island is eerily reminiscent. Kingsley and von Sydow are reliably subtle. Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson are likewise excellent in very different roles.    Progressively surreal circumstances make both Teddy and the audience increasingly uncomfortable. The surprisingly straightforward ending has been criticized as cheap and predictable. However, it has enough substance to make the viewer consider seeing the film twice.    Problems include one too many smiles by crazy folks. Instead of creepy, they come across as cliche. Also, though visually astounding, flashbacks and dream sequences lack intriguing dialogue. Per usual in adaptations of Dennis Lehane novels (Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River), the love interest is more a foil to the male protagonist than a fully developed character.    The movie's slow pace resembles the similarly scored Stanley Kubrick classic 'The Shining.' Though 'Shutter Island' doesn't reach those heights, it is good in its own right, especially towards the middle of the piece, when viewers don't know what to think or hold on to.
B003KVNV4S|1.0|What did i just listen to?    This sounds exactly like some recycled Paul Mccartney material.  Each song gets cornier and cornier by each passing minute. Boring and excruciatingly difficult to enjoy.  I generally have no problems with laid back/soft tracks, but this was just wow. My ears felt empty and lifeless after listening to this. Thank you The Nation, I really thank you.     Do yourself a favor and skip this one folks.
B002ZG980U|2.0|Combine an innovative director, idea, and cast. Add to that a story that questions reality, physics defying fight scenes, and wonderful special effects. What do you get? Unfortunately, with Inception, not much.    Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento) directs this complex blockbuster about mental espionage. Using fancy technology, expert thief Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is able to sneak into a subject's subconscious to steal information. Inception's plot involves an even more difficult, nigh impossible, assignment: planting an idea. At the behest of the shady Saito (Ken Watanabe), Cobb and his crew plan to give Saito's economic competitor Fischer (Cillian Murphy) the impulse to dissolve his company. Complicating matters is the projection of Cobb's dead wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), who violently haunts his every entry into dreamland.    The film is more interested in muddled sequences reminiscent of Tomb Raider than characters. In an attempt to build suspense, scenes move from one shot to another and back ad nauseum.    Nolan's measured character studies and puzzle-like plots are often superior to his action scenes. But here characters, one of Nolan's strengths, are subtle to the point of dullness. They come across as mere plot devices. This may be intentional, a metacognitive device, but it doesn't make our heroes any more interesting.    Slightly unhinged and haunted by a dead wife, Cobb is distractingly reminiscent of DiCaprio's role in the movie Shutter Island. Cobb's psychosis isn't enthralling enough to emotionally anchor the plot. His right hand man Joseph Gordon-Levitt looks smashing but is lifeless. Ellen Page as Ariadne, the dream architect, looks lovely but is likewise uninteresting. Tom Hardy's Eames is the cheeky but two dimensional \\"forger\\" who can change his appearance once in a dream. Watanabe's Saito is at first mysterious, but ultimately opaque as anyone else. Dileep Rao as Yusuf, the apothecary, is intriguingly amoral - or maybe not; his character is hardly developed. In an unsatisfying part, Murphy, whose subconscious everyone enters, excels. He stands out as the only one who evokes sympathy. Cotillard as the dangerously multifaceted Mal is also excellent.    None of these characters hold many, if any, surprises. In fact, there are few twists in the entire movie , which is bizarre for a Nolan flick. Also unusual for one of his films is a lack of moral exploration. Our protagonists break into someone's mind. This isn't really questioned. The cast's remarkable chemistry makes a lack of humor conspicuous. They all remained so cool, it's difficult to feel suspense.    Perhaps Inception is difficult \\"to get.\\" It's easy to ask, whose subconscious are they in? How did they get there? Why? What's at stake? This confusion prevents you from enjoying the film, but the real problem is not caring about the explanation.
0316017922|5.0|My husband and I both really enjoyed this book. I think that a lot of people would really benefit from reading it. It has good information and it could change your life if you were able to put to use the knowledge you gain from reading it.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|Though Winter's Bone builds an atmosphere of dread, self-consciousness undermines its resonance.    Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with her family in the Missouri Ozarks. Her drug dealing father, nowhere to be found, has put up their house and land as collateral for his bail. Ree vows to find him even as she cares for her younger siblings and mentally ill mother. She must face down hostile relatives to get to the truth behind her father's disappearance and, more importantly, save her home.    Winter's Bone (an adaptation of Daniel Woodrell's novel ) feels like a cultural lesson in rural poverty. Close ups accompany tense moments. A shaky camera conveys the area's rawness. Winter is captured in rare beauty, with its dead leaves, barren trees, and back roads. Scenes of everyday survival (including wood chopping and squirrel hunting) are interspersed with Ree's search for her father. Unfortunately, the filmmakers' obvious (but largely successful) attempts at authenticity come across as manipulative. The unusual filmic setting is the foreground, which makes the characters somewhat secondary.    Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Ree, but her character is difficult to identify with. A youth with troubles beyond anyone's years is not unrealistic, but Ree is nearly perfect. Unselfish, wise, understanding, tough, and above all determined, Ree is willing to sacrifice everything for her wards, without ever losing her temper with them. She has bouts of insecurity and naïveté, but she is more admirable than interesting.    The acting is quite good, though little liveliness is shown. Characters' pinched cheeks, chapped lips, and grim faces are realistic, but few leave an impression. In fact the only fascinating presence is Teardrop (John Hawkes), Ree's coke addicted uncle. Ambiguous and scary but loyal, Teardrop is not someone you want as an enemy.    Overly poetic dialogue jars with the rest of the film's painstaking attempts at realism. Saintly Ree gives her brother advice such as \\"don't ask for what ought to be offered,\\" and notes that she is a \\"Dolly, bred and buttered.\\" Also, Ree's search gets rather repetitive as she is told by person after person to give up her quest.    Since images of barren trees and a haunting, gorgeous soundtrack evoke an ominous mood from the beginning, any darkness that lies within the community doesn't come as a shock. More surprising are the displays of genuine kindness. More astonishing still in this gothic tale would have been expressions joy or dynamism.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a 25 year old very active woman, I play hockey at least twice weekly at a pretty intensive rate, and I play basketball, soccer and flag football on the side just for fun. I've tried kick boxing and zumba and they seemed to give me a work out but not kick my butt. I wanted something that would work quickly and get me into better shape. I'm having hip surgery in 2 months and I want to be as fit as possible (plus, it wouldn't help to lose some weight seeing as I'll put it back on during recovery). I looked into this seeing as I love Jillian Michaels on the biggest loser and the show where she kicks fat families into gear. I love just how intense she is, so I came to amazon and  read the (high) reviews of this product, skeptically, knowing that not all workouts are paced correctly for me or they don't give me as particularly intense workout as compared to an hour of intensely played hockey.     I went for it, going off all the hype on Amazong. When I got it I previewed the DVD through all levels. Thinking levels 1 and 2 were do-able and level 3 might be a tougher... I thought I could progress quite quickly up to level 3 and see a challenge. Well, level 1 being easy just because I'm \\"in shape\\" turned out to be false. Jillian is brilliant. Whatever she does a) works and b) can make you feel like you were at the gym for 2 hours. In college, I used to have a workout program and this workout was comparable to an hour and a half of intense dry-land and lifting. She kicked my butt on level one. So I would suggest taking your time through the levels. If you did 2-3 weeks on each level that's at least 1.5 months of workout!    In so far as weight-loss... I'm not sure, yet. I do know that I feel like I've done one of the boot camps at the local gyms. So we'll see. As Jillian said, you can't expect to do a 20-minute work-out, get results, and not have it be tough. My favorite line of Jillian's is that she refuses to modify jumping jacks. She has 400lbs people doing jumping jacks and so can you. You really do need to push yourself, cause you can. If you don't push through when it gets tough and you take breaks, you won't see the results or feel quite as \\"rocked\\" by Jillian. I would also suggest following a strict diet. I'm currently eating under 1,500 calories a day and following suggestions for meals to recover and not feel \\"ravenous.\\"     It's the best [...]  ([...] after [...] weights at five below) I've ever spent. DO THIS NOW. You WILL NOT regret this.

B000RJO578|5.0|I like a variety of film types, but I generally prefer realistic ones.  Hot Fuzz is not even remotely realistic, and if I were some kind of anal, emotionless reviewer (I've read things from many of those), I would slaughter the film for its inconsistencies.<br /><br />But, I'm not.  I'm a normal human who likes to laugh, and this movie makes me do just that...over and over and over.  I have watched Hot Fuzz probably 10 times and I am STILL catching new little details that I missed before.  If I could use one word to sum up what makes Hot Fuzz so good, it would be the fact that it is \\"CLEVER.\\"  Yes, the acting is pretty good, the filming is excellent, and the story is...if not probable, entertaining...but the film's coherence, irony, and subtle puns are where it really delivers.<br /><br />A couple of things are needed to really enjoy this movie (provided you enjoy funny movies even when their premise is silly).  The first is a good knowledge of British slang, and the second is subtitles, at least the first time around.  Due to my choice to not use subtitles, I am still, as I said, catching tidbits here and there of dialogue, not to mention visuals.  Once you can understand and comprehend what's being said, though, you'll love this film.<br /><br />Since I hope we can all agree the movie isn't meant to be realistic, I'll just laughingly mention the few glaring flaws in common sense (which I believe were intentional).  The final gun battle was hilarious.  Nobody could aim well enough to hit the broad side of a barn, and the sheer scale of the battle was mere audacity.  The ease with which Angel turned the other cops from being rude and dismissive (especially the detectives) to joining his side enthusiastically, in the face of their screaming Inspector, was quite ludicrous.  And, of course, the entire premise of \\"killing people for the slightest possible construed offense\\" (such as Tiller, for planning to leave town and \\"share her horticultural expertise with other villages\\") was nonsensical.  Yes, the film's ENTIRE PREMISE was a joke.<br /><br />Did that make me scoff and roll my eyes?  Not at all.  I did wish there was a little more development of Angel turning the cops to join his cause, but otherwise, epic gun fight and silly central theme included, I thought the film was spectacular.  Again, the clever dialogue and the intricate cohesiveness are what really give this a 5-star rating in my book.  It's hard to verbally describe what I mean, but the way events and comments are timed, and the subtle background details that accompany them, work together like a puzzle or a fine clock.  Quotes from early in the film are repeated later in a completely different context.  One of my favorite details is the dual reference to \\"Aaron A. Aaronson\\"; watch the film and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />Irony also finds a strong use in the film, be it the subtle irony in each person's name (Angel is a near-flawless do-gooder, Butterman Jr. is obese, Tiller is a gardener, Hatcher delivers babies, etc.); the irony that each \\"action cop\\" stunt that Danny wishes to perform, he gets to later on; or the irony that Skinner is finally stopped by the only TRUE \\"accident\\" in the film (tripping over the toy truck).  The screenwriters here were masters of clever tricks and I loved it.<br /><br />What's more, the filming is delightful.  I really like the style employed here, as in Shaun of the Dead, with fast montages of various simple actions leading from one regular-paced scene to the next (such as in Angel's journey, via trains and taxi, from London to Sandford, or his initial entry to his hotel room).  Other film tricks that I enjoyed were fast compilations of various camera angles, such as when Doctor Hatcher pumps his shotgun during the gunfight, in which I counted 6 or 7 layered camera angles that actually made the action somewhat \\"slow-mo\\" as it contained a repeat of the same scene, all within the span of 2 seconds or so.<br /><br />In summary,Hot Fuzz is a brilliant movie that reflects hours of careful planning, stunning acting and delivery, innovative and snappy filming, and of course a ludicrous, overly crazy plot that only adds to the fun rather than making the movie suck.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh, is not offended by profanity, and can handle considerable gore.areful planning, stunning acting and delivery, innovative and snappy filming, and of course a ludicrous, overly crazy plot that only adds to the fun rather than making the movie suck.

B00008YJH5|5.0|Personally I think that Doolittle is very overrated, but the overwhelming number of 5 star reviews leads me to think that there's no point in arguing with the majority but instead to sell Surfer Rosa for what it is. I absolutely love Surfer Rosa and is near perfect. The drums sound amazing, Santiago's guitaring is so simple but genius and so effective and Frank Black's voice is very amusing and very enjoyable to listen to. I read a review describing the album as 'beautifully brutal' which i think hits the nail on the head.  I love the jarring discordancy throughout mixed with the very inventive melodies and couldn't ask for much more.  'Vamos' is my absolute favourite Pixies song and I fell in love with the whole album very quickly.     With Doolittle on the other hand I find 2 minute songs lasting a lifetime with some very dull songs that go nowhere, such as 'There Goes My Gun' and 'I Bleed'. I've only ever managed to sit through it once, I always have to skip.  Still, 'Hey' and others are classics.    Surfer Rosa's much more fun too.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  It is one of my all-time favorites, a staple in my collection, and something that I insist everyone watch.  This is not a light statement, considering that before I watched it for the first time (which was something I did entirely because people said it was \\"really good,\\" long after it had come out on DVD), I thought the entire premise of \\"Batman\\" was stupid.  I had no desire to watch a Batman film, because I have never been a \\"comic geek,\\" and my favorite movies are realistic ones, such as the Bourne series.  What I did not realize was that Batman is no \\"superhero\\" like Spiderman (which I don't care for), but just a man trying to make a change in his world, and that The Dark Knight was one of the most realistic movies I would ever lay eyes on.<br /><br />You might think, \\"Well of course you loved it.  Like a typical young person, you thought the Lamborghini and the hand-to-hand combat were cool.\\"  Well, yes, I did.  But, unlike many of my peers, I was also able to catch, and appreciate (if not the very first time I watched it) the extremely powerful moral themes woven into the engaging storyline.<br /><br />The Dark Knight has managed to do something simply incredible.  It first took on the (not necessary, but profitable) task of reinventing the Batman story, which had been turned into nothing short of a joke in previous films (filled with excessively cheesy content and flamboyant, fruity characters) and putting a majorly serious, mature spin on it.  While doing this, it took the opportunity to use this particular basis (Batman, as opposed to any other fictional character) to present the insightful viewer with an intricate look at the ideas of good vs. evil.  The theme of good vs. evil is literally the oldest in the book (especially if \\"the book\\" is \\"The Bible\\") but so many films, books, games, etc. have taken it to be \\"kill all the bad guys and good wins, and of course good will always triumph.\\"  Well that is just about the opposite of how real life works.  There IS no line between good and evil.  Things done in the name of \\"good\\" can easily be seen as horrifying even by those on the side of \\"good.\\"  Evil can't be \\"stopped\\" because everyone has selfish tendencies, and even those fighting for justice can fall (exemplified by Harvey Dent).<br /><br />What's more, on top of reinventing Batman and portraying the timeless clash of ideals, The Dark Knight presents character development like none other, which is credit to the excellent acting of its stars.  NOTHING in this film comes across as fake or cheesy.  Even the questionable (futuristic) technology employed in some places did not turn me off, and it is notable that the main \\"tech,\\" the Batsuit, is not outlandish.<br /><br />But wait, there's more.  All of what I've praised so far could be done in a live theater play, but when it comes to the art of film-making, once again The Dark Knight knocks it out of the stadium.  I realize that each person has their own preferred style, but the Dark Knight really resonated with me.  The shots employed, the dark gritty style, the subtle but powerful musical score, the sleek and modern settings (such as Bruce Wayne's desirable penthouse and underground \\"batcave\\"), and the lighting all contribute to an extremely intense, glorious picture.<br /><br />One last notable detail is that The Dark Knight has managed to be phenomenal AND wildly successful AND critically acclaimed, all without employing sex or profanity.  So many modern films rely on the concept of \\"if things get a bit dull, have someone yell 'F**k!' or get into a steamy 'romance' situation.\\"  As a whole, our society gravitates toward \\"taboo\\" things like excessive swearing and no-strings sex, which explains the success of this formula.  The Dark Knight, however, rises above this petty means of generating laughs and interest, without making its hardened characters seem like repressive prudes.<br /><br />Watch this movie.  Watch it even if you hate superheroes andcomic books.  Watch it if you prefer deep, contemplative films to action flicks.  Watch it if you prefer action flicks to deep, contemplative films.

B002VPE1XE|5.0|My wife has a smaller digital camera that she really likes.  How it has survived all the knocking around it has recieved over the past year I will never know.  I did know that it's life was limited if I didn't get her a camera case that was small enough for her to use regularly, but big enough to hold some accessories.  This camera case really fits the bill.... it's nicely padded, but no so much as to make it bulky.  It has a belt loop that is strongly closed with velcro so it can be removed from or placed on the belt without having to take your belt off.  It has a very nice full velcro front closure that holds the camera securely in the case even when you are actively moving around.  No worries about the camera falling out.  It also has a hand strap if you want to hold the camera and case in your hand. It has a nice zippered compartment on the front of the case, that is also covered by the front closure velcro.  This is just the right size to hold extra micro chips and a good supply of AA size batteries.  This is a real plus since my wife's camera seems to run out of battery power at all the wrong times and the extra batteries are always back in the car.  The price and the features of this camera case make it just right for most of the smaller digital cameras.  If your camera is no more than 4.5 inces long, 3 inches wide and 2 inches thick, which includes a lot of the more popular cameras, this is the right case for you.  I recommend it.

And then she sleeping with another man while not yet divorced from her husband.  What the heck!!!???!!!  Then she says that God is not necessarily the God of the Bible.  Finally she decides to sleep with a man in Bali but never marry him.  AARRGHH!!!  If you have a Christian worldview, you will not like this book.

B0036EH3X4|1.0|I've had this season pre-ordered since February.  After doing some thinking, I just can't justify the $47 price tag, especially after being so disappointed with it.  I've already seen the 12 minute epilogue, and I don't really feel like watching this series for a 4th or 5th time...especially with the way it attempted to \\"wrap\\" things up.  Maybe when this season hits around $25, I'll buy it.  The whole season is awful and unrelated to the rest of the series.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|If you are John Driscoll, then you are the first mate on the Venture - an old steamer about to get underway.  The New York tugboats are backing away.  You are shouting commands and waving your arms about, when, unexpectedly, your hand smacks something behind you; it felt soft.  You turn and find a young woman rubbing her chin.    It's Ann Darrow.  She's that woman that Carl Denham brought aboard last night.  She is to star in his new picture.  The trouble is, women aboard a ship are a nuisance, but then Denham is paying for this trip.  You brusquely tell her to stay out of the way; however, for all your gruffness, you are secretly pleased that she is aboard.    It took more than six weeks to reach the Indian Ocean and find Denham's uncharted isle.  Masses of rock jut skyward from its jungle floor; sea cliffs overlook the breakers; the only access is a sandy beach along a tapering peninsula; and separating it from the jungle is an enormous stone wall.    Upon landing, you find the villager's preparing a girl for sacrifice, but when they offer a trade for Ann, you retreat to the ship.  That night, you finally tell Ann that you love her.  You are called away.  The next time you see her, she is in the clutches of an enormous beast.  You chase it through the jungles, swamps, canyons, and cliffs; your ears ring with the screams of your mates and the roars of the dinosaurs.  Oh Ann!    Overall:  The best adventure-monster movie ever made!  It's a well-crafted story, chock full of suspense and action.  Listen closely to the dialog; it's loaded with preludes of actions to come.  This movie defines the word: classic.    Picture (DVD): 3, a few minor defects.

B003S6T62Q|5.0|This is coming from the perspective of a \\"huge\\" Joe fan.  I never thought Joe got the credit he deserves from the industry and music fans.  I am glad to see that someone is coming up with new ideas to promote Joe's music, something more than CDs for his fans to enjoy.  I saw Joe live in concert in Boston, at Berklee Performance Center, and I will never forget it.     This DVD is quality in terms of it's audio and edits, and not only does it come with more than an hour of live performance, you also get three of Joe's most recent music videos to add to your collection.  I was pleased to be walking through the store and see that Joe has a live concert DVD on the shelves.  I think his new record label is doing the right thing.      Joe's performance was recorded in Japan, in front of a Japanese audience of course.  Joe does a great job with the vocals, with a full band behind him, small horn section, drums, keys, guitar and bass.  He sounds great, but he also performs an acoustic selection of songs from the \\"All that I Am\\" album.  You get to see that Joe can play guitar and sing at the same time.  Not many of Joe's fans know that he plays the guitar.  I believe the performance covers a complete list of Joe's best songs.  Some of them are shortened or in the form of a medley, but I believe he picked the right songs to perform at length.  He focuses on some of his most recent music, because obviously he wants to promote his latest albums.  But, he performs all of his older stuff including \\"Stutter,\\" \\"I Wanna Know,\\" and \\"Good Girls.\\"  Joe performs all of his current singles as well.      The disc is very enjoyable, but I must say that I do not think it should have been filmed in Japan.  The Japanese must express excitement about music very differently than American audiences.  They seem awful quiet in the audience, and it does not show the excitement that Joe creates with the American audience.  I suppose it is just a cultural difference, and perhaps they enjoyed the musicjust as much.  In that way, it is unlike most live DVDs, the ones you see of R. Kelly or Usher are quite different in the level of excitement.  But, I've been to Joe's concert live and I know the excitement is there.  Despite this, I still give it 5 stars!!    Overall, I highly recommend this DVD, if you buy it, you won't regret it!!
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I bought this game as I remember playing it as a 12 year old or so, and it is just as fun now that I am 20. The game system is perfect for this style of game and I spent 6hours playing this the day I opened it.
B003JTHETY|4.0|I like the new Maiden, but would've preferred for them to come out really rocking hard this time out.  This music is good, but it doesn't impress me nearly as much as their classic albums do (e.g. Seventh Son).  While Iron Maiden are still incredibly impressive live, I hope they don't remain in this mellower state when they record.  Bruce's \\"Chemical Wedding\\" was so damn impressive and hard rocking that it set a benchmark in my mind.
B003YP0BI4|3.0|Love Maiden since 1982 - this record, however, seems to be redundant and a step towards a direction a personally do not favor. I am missing the huge choruses and the hooks - listened to this record twice yesterday and I am still not able to tell a difference amongst all songs - to me they sound alike - at least for now. Maybe it will grow on me but the last one didn't either (Matter of Live and Death)- maybe I am alone with this but this does not live up to Brave New World or the Dance of Death. I specifically avoid comparisons with Phase 2 Maiden until Fear of the Dark. However - a mediocre Maiden Record is still fun - Up The Irons.
B00008BXJF|5.0|Ok I am a huge Crimhead and I was in a Hasting's one day back sometime in 2003 and saw this cd.  At first I thought it was a live album because of the cover art.  The artist is a man named Pj Crook and he has done many cd/dvd covers for King Crimson all of them being live.  When I found out it was a studio album with all new songs I had to get it.  I had absolutley no idea what this album was going to sound like and I took it home and listened to it.  When I listened to it I couldn't stop listning to it.  I was not familiar with the previous album, Constucktion Of Light, so I didn't know what to expect.  This follows in the same field as Construcktion but better.  A million times better.  Every other song is intrumental and there's a lot of heavy stuff on this album.  It starts off with Adrian Belew singing unacompanied into a vocader and then with song 2, Level Five,  It gets real heavy and ugly in a beautiful way.  Fans of metal and espescialy Tool fans should absolutley love this.  The playing is top notch and the production is great.  It is super polished but with Crimson thats a good thing.  This album is definetly in my top 5 favorite King Crimson albums and in some ways this is their best album.  Everything about it is great.  The playing, the production, the vocals and even the great cover art by Pj Crook.  The album is a blend heavy, dark, moody, ambient, and experimental.  Moments where it rocks are Level Five, Elektrik, Facts Of Life, happy With What You have To Be Happy With.  And mellow and ambient in other times with Eyes Wide Open, the Power To Believe II.  and even suspensful with Dangerous Curves.  every Crimhead should own this or atleast listen to it.  For the old school Crimhead who's wanting to hear more experimental, pyschadelia from the first album, In The Court Of The Crimson King, or a funk, new wave fell with Discipline you will be disapointed.  but if you were a fan of Thraak and like it heavy and colorful then you will probaly absolutleylove this.  This is in my opinion the absolute best album ever of 2003 and very essential King Crimson.  So far this is the latest album they have put out but I hope they still have one more album left in them.  Especialy now with Tony Levin back and second drummer Gavin Harrison.  I'll definetly be looking forward to another Crimson album whenever they put one out and knowing me I'll buy it on the release date.  A+ for this masterpiece.
1439181780|5.0|I have been a student of The Law of Attraction for decades now.  I could list hundreds of books that are excellent reading.  I think it just depends on where you're at as far as being drawn to something  People were ready for The Secret and it made you hungry for more.  I'm sure everyone who read it went on to read many more books on this subject.    I recieved The Power today (ordered it back in July).  I'm not quite half way through it, but I like it.  It's that shot of inspiration I crave when I get lazy and forget what I already know.  I'm excited to finish it and will add to this review then.    Rhonda talks about \\"Love\\" being \\"The Power\\", but not love as we think of it, i.e., romantic, love for our children, etc., but a true force ofpower of it's own.  Without utilizing this love-power, we are unable to create as we desire.      Rhonda says life isn't what happens to us, but what RESPONDS to us.     So far, I would definitely recommend this book.
B002RWKSII|5.0|First off, I have been a huge fan since I was 5. But that won't allow me to believe that everything Wilson puts out is Gold. Though I have to say, the new work, Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin is the real deal! When I first heard that Wilson was going to tackle this project I was worried. He's my idol and I didn't want to see him fail. His voice, though coarsened since the mid 70's is in top form here. Wilson does George and Ira proud! I love this album so much it's on constant rotation in my living room. Even if you're not a big Gershwin fan but you've always loved the Beach Boys sound, this will turn you on to Gershwin!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|No exaggeration! I am not the type of person that has the patience or memory to tune into a channel every week to watch something, this is an exception!  I never saw such a creative series before and the fantasy genre is somewhat extinct on television too.  This show holds a monopoly on fantasy and does a terrific job.  THE GOOD  the storyline is witty, fast paced, action packed, and even romantic.  There are shocking twists and close calls that left me and my sister jumping up and down screaming.  It's based on the sword of truth book series which are just as amazing and sold MILLIONS of copies    The action scenes are flawless, it's all so cinematic!  The fights and battles in this show are just like a five star action movie except you can see it every week!    The cast's chemistry is amazing, there's so much tension between Richard and Kahlan, Cara is absolutely hilarious/badass and so is Zedd.  The dialogue characterizes each person very well and is never corny or cheesy.    The supporting cast members are so talented and lovable. Rachel is the sweetest thing in the world, Denna is totally evil, Chase is so cool, and Lord Rahl is of course the best tyrant in fiction    The visual and special effects are so cool its like magic really does exist.  This show is just like a movie!    The setting is beautiful, it's all filmed in New Zealand (nuff said)    THE BAD  the show is cancelled :(, but we still have a chance we can still save our seeker! just like Xena!    you are not watching it right now, instead your reading my review which is far less entertaining than this show.
0553381687|5.0|So many fantasy books depend on the setting -- a magical world filled with mythic monsters and powerful wizards. But A Game of Thrones is a fantasy book that focuses on its characters rather than its setting. In fact, I often forgot I was reading a fantasy novel. But that didn't matter because Martin's characters filled the pages with so much energy that it didn't feel like anything was lacking.<br /><br />That's not to say that a fantasy world doesn't exist in the book. It broods in the background. There are references to important places and people and events, but these always seemed separate from the main plot. By the last chapters, however, Martin starts to push the world into the forefront, and you realize that the world is about to intrude itself into the lives of all of these great characters.
B0015DWJX2|3.0|This could have been the best book I've read this year.  Could have been, but wasn't.  Told from a unique perspective -- after the war, rather than during -- this story of courage and resilience hums with the brilliantly conceived (albeit a bit too wholesome) lives of its characters.  Much of the story is told with a wit and empathy which balance well against the atrocities it depicts, and I cannot agree with those who argue that its shortcoming is its lightheartedness.  No, the real gremlins here are the poorly conceived narrative structure, the authors' outworn loyalty to the epistolary form, and the failure of the book to cohere thematically.  When I was halfway through reading it, I brought it to a friend in great excitement, ecstatic to share such a gem.  She told me she had already read it, and I was in for a disappointment in the second part.  She was right.  Who wants to read the same old story about the oh-so-intelligent but laughably stubborn woman who falls in love with the oh-so-reserved but privately passionate man?  And then they suffer through a series of misunderstandings until all comes right of a sudden -- in a great whoosh of melodrama -- at the end?  Austen told this story well enough; I wish talented writers would lay it to rest.  This book should have ceased being an epistolary novel and instead adopted some other, more immediate narrative form once the protagonist arrived in Guernsey.  And it especially should not have lost sight of its major theme in the second half: the power of literature (including letters) to nurture, empower, bond, and heal.  Sadly, the authors trade in this powerful theme for a trite love story.  Even the villains (of the book's present time, not the Nazis) fail to deliver real menace or to advance the plot.  And the novel's past and present events are woefully out of sync with each other, at least in terms of emotional impact on the reader.  If the writers had conferred patiently and deeply, I think they could have written a masterpiece.  As it happens, what they wrote is quaint, quirky, and occasionally enthralling (especially in its early observations on the habits and nature of reading), but tragically middle-of-the-road.tten a masterpiece.

B0029LX2LC|4.0|Since Game Theory I was worried that The Roots may be on a bit of a slippery slope, as although GT was still a great album I didn't feel it lived up the previous albums, I too enjoyed Rising Down but that only had glimpses of genius, there were a few suspect tracks.  How I Got Over changes all that, this is top quality production and Tariq shines as usual, the album is consistent throughout and I haven't once skipped a track, this could be considered another classic, and the only reason for not giving a 5 is that it felt a little too short, it's the sort of album you don't want to end.

From the opening chords and lyrics of \\"Memory Pain\\" to the original instrumental that spawned brother Edgar's \\"Frankenstein\\", your mood will get better and better. I couldn't pass up this Legacy double disc with the good quality live cd from Europe. Re-mastered and a huge compliment to Johnny's self titled first record which can be had with bonus tracks these days. This double disc has some rock n roll in it as well, and he is so original that you can forget that Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, or Bob Dylan wrote the tune. Why wait to feel good, buy this now before it sells out.
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis writes very good books about Wall St. I have read his Liars' Poker, but I think this is a much better book about how hedge funds take advantage of the subprime mortgage crisis. It does not come close to the stories about Enron, but does give you very good idea why people are disgusted with Wall St, with their abilities to \\"market\\" junk as AAA investment and how they actually build the domino so that when things falls, they all fall! If this is the trend, then \\"too-big-to-fail\\" will never go away.
0743455967|5.0|I'm no fan of Steven King the novelist. Nevertheless, I heard him interviewed on NPR for what was, I believe, the 10th anniversary of On Writing. I knew I had to read it. The [...] recording was made by King himself, lending this very personal book an added layer of poignancy.<br /><br />It's not a spoiler to say that the climax of the story is his should-have-been-fatal accident while walking down a Maine highway.<br /><br />Along the way are unforgettable tales of his childhood ear infections; or the one where he was drunk at a drive-in when the manager interrupted the movie and announced over the speakers, \\"Mr. King, return home, your wife is having the baby\\"; how he wrote and sold his first hit book, \\"Carrie\\".<br /><br />King says, \\"forget about plot, tell a story\\", and he certain has done so here.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I originally saw the theatrical version and was highly disappointed. I kind of felt lost through the whole movie and the battles seemed anti-climactic, probably due to not knowing the characters well enough. It looked like it had a lot of potential but was just too scattered.  I bought the director's cut blu-ray based on all the reviews on Amazon and it lived up to the hype. The director's cut is much easier to follow and is a great movie. Blu-ray looks and sounds great and it's one of those movies you can put in to show off your home theater. Like everyone else has said, if you like epic war and history movies like this and you were disappointed with the theatrical version you owe it to yourself to check out the director's cut.

B000EZ7ZYA|3.0|I love this movie and have watched tens of times. I already had DVD but I bought Blu-lay version because it was on sale and expected some newer features in it.    But, there were nothing new... actually it's even worse. There weren't some features which were in the DVD version like deleted scenes, different opening etc.!!    If you have DVD, that's fine to buy this as an additional collection if the price is reasonable, but if you are thinking of buying Blu-ray as only one collection, I think you should buy DVD. With a DVD player with upscale converter to 1080i or 1080P, the picture quality is not much different after all.
B002RWKSII|5.0|A sobering and unexpected question from a co-worker when I mentioned the imminent release of this titanic pairing of recognized masters - hoping against hope that the potential downside and inflated expectations of \\"reimagining\\" such a well known and respected canon of Gershwin classics would be avoided. Well, generational amnesia not withstanding, Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin is a really good (almost great) recording that builds-out on the strengths of Wilson's nonpareil gifts as an arranger and producer while deftly compensating for his understandably diminished vocal capacity.    Wilson's Gershwin is a beautiful, fully realized soundscape that deserves uninterrupted and repeated listening. What Wilson summons is an America before surfboards and Elvis when music was the province of melody, nuance and a full spectrum of emotions beyond anger. This is a gorgeous (and wonderfully flawed) record that may get a Grammy nod on sentimentality alone - but just might deserve it even if you have never heard of Brian Wilson or the Gershwin brothers.     Highly recommended.
0547258305|3.0|Cashore's debut novel has a really interesting and exciting concept. I was excited to read this because it sounded unique. However there are a few flaws. I felt that I was reading a rough draft to what could be a really great novel.    There was too much page time given to moments that contributed little to the plot and not enough time given to the development of Katsa and Po's relationship. Or almost any relationship for that matter. Cashore pretty much just tells you instead of showing you what's going on, which cheats the reader out of really emotionally investing in the characters.    One thing that I thought was kind of annoying was how major plot points were simply and abruptly stumbled upon, as if in all Cashore's writing of tedious traveling and eating, she remembered to advance the plot.    Also, I think Po's name shouldn't have survived whoever edited this book, because I just flashback to Mulan and \\"Let's get down to business.....\\" In fact, I liked his given name Greening better.    Katsa's character has signs of Mary Sue. The fact that she's so powerful and skilled and people disliking and fearing her for it is an MS cliche, but perhaps forgivable for the amount of emotional flaws she has.    That being said, I really, really, really wanted to fall head over heels for this book, especially because it features older teens in a multi-genre setting. It's not a bad book; not a terrific book, but it's worth the time in reading it.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|It shows just how awesome an actor like John Lithgow is, when within in the first minutes of season four, we seem him brutally murder a girl, but then once we track him down and see his family for the first time, the feeling of conflicting emotions rises with in you.<br />Of course the mask of Arthur Mitchell completely falls away and you feel no remorse towards his imminent downfall, but for awhile there I couldn't understand how he could portray completely different people within one character.<br />I must also applaud Michael C. Hall's performance. It was easy to see this season why these wonderful actors won Golden Globes for this season.<br />This season is by far my favorite, and I think everyone has mentioned this one before, but I will say it as well, the Thanksgiving episode, \\"Hungry Man,\\" is easily the best of the season and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole episode. I will also never forget Mitchell's chilling words that gave me goosebumps, \\"Hello, Dexter Morgan.\\"<br />It is a brilliant show, and now I absolutely cannot wait for the fifth season.
1423101472|5.0|The final book of this series was very satisfying to read. The action, drama, humor, and Percy's journey makes this an epic story.    Everyone we met in the previous stories makes an appearance along with a new character, the last Olympian (I won't spoil it). I loved how Percy and his friends gets closure and accolades for all their efforts. Percy was not the only one to get all the glory and I like his choice in the end.    The overall theme of the books was about family, friends, home and upon reflection, this is what makes the whole series worth every dime I spent purchasing it. Because where do we go when the adventure is over? We go home, right?  The Percy Jackson series is an awesome adventure with an appropriate finale and thinking about the story only makes me want to read it again. Highly enjoyed and recommended.
B003OF3R0S|3.0|I have been a a7x fan since they first poped up with sounding the 7th trumpet, but this album to me was just not the best they could have done. If you are a fan it is worth picking up but don't expect to be blown away by this one.    R.I.P- The Rev
0786838655|5.0|I was so happy I picked up this book as an afterthought to watching the movie. Wow, was I impressed and excited. I fell in love with the series as a whole and the first book in the series, Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief, started it all.     Some parts of the story reminded me of my other love (Harry Potter) but as the story continues beyond the first three chapters they are nothing alike. I was immersed in a world of Greek mythology and the possibilities and what-if's that were never considered were done well in the story. This is a journey of a Greek world/universe through a son of Poseidon and I thought this was unique. Percy is that everyman character that is essential to a hero story. I thought his demigod qualities/powers were fun and could foresee the use of it as he grew up (or in further books). Every character he meets niggles the brain on your own knowledge of Greek mythology but it didn't mean I put down the book to google a certain God or monster.  I did that after completing book.    I absolutely recommend this book to that curious youth or child at heart adult that likes adventure, buckets of humor and Greek mythology. You'll find it all shaped in one story here.
B000056VJ7|2.0|..Thank god I never bought this crappy crap of the Most Magnificently Over-Produced, Mediocre, Monotone, Flesh-Ripping for impunity, bore of an album!!!<br /><br />  I scream for mercy after 20 seconds of each song..!!!  Only because, every single song on here needs to be,,,, --20 seconds!!  They keep playing the same chorus the Entire time for each track!  There's nothing new.  No changes. No leads. No anger.  No Love. No dimension at all.  I get so bored hearing the same prosaic line over and over and over...  (get the point)  Damn!  That's got to be sooooo  boring to play.<br /><br />  Ask yourself a question..  Coors Lite or Hefenweizen?  Plain ol' sunny side ups, or a chili cheese omelet smothered in tabasco?  Straight to bed?, or a Jack on the rocks for a night cap.  If your answer is the 2nd on each, then this music is probably not for you.  Can we say \\"Humdrum?\\"<br /><br />  I don't even know how to explain this.  It seems like it's Christian soft rock.  Like they would play for a church.  I know they aren't though.  I definitely would tell you that I like Meatloaf as a person and entertainer, but his music sucks.<br /><br />  The title song, \\"BAT OUT OF HELL\\" is decent. Tolerable.  Sounds like '''cool mom''' rock ((I mean SOFT, FAKE rock)) from the 70's or something.  ?$@!  ((Whatever that means ???))  If I were ever to shop at one of those fancy, clothing outdoor-mall stores for middle aged burn outs who still think they're hip, I would expect to hear this playing.  ...so they will keep consuming.<br /><br />\\"YOU TOOK THE WORDS---\\"  This one starts out kinda good, but after...  (you guessed it) 20 seconds, it goes and repeats itself until you want to fork your eyeballs out of their sockets to ease your pain..  The name of the song is practically the entire lyrics over and over.  ARE THEY SERIOUS! He couldn't find just ONE MORE effing verse!<br /><br />\\"HEAVEN CAN WAIT\\"  It's ok. but it's too long, they don't change it up enough for the length of this number .  -A third of the way in, you expect it to kick in and reverse itself of something. You know.... start to get interesting again.  Half way through you just press 'skip'.  He sings it well, and he's got a good voice here.  But, Its too long, too monotonous. -hard to keep the faith.  Too bad.......<br /><br />''ALL REVVED UP WITH NOWHERES TO GO\\"  This, with BAT OUT OF HELL, are the only two songs that are worth listening to on this album.  Oh yeah, with a bit of HEAVEN..  There's a little riff in here that's kinda catchy.  But don't get your hopes up.<br /><br />TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD  ...Do you really want to know how gut-churning this song is???  Well, I'm not gonna tell ya.  You deserve better.<br /><br />PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD LIGHT  ..Now that I think about it..  I never did get through the entire song here..  I took a burning hot steel metal rod and burned my ears down to my skull, and singed my eardrums shut forever half way through it.  PURE SACRILEGE.<br /><br />FOR CRYING OUT LOUD  ..Now that my eardrums are charcoaled with carbon and resin.  This song played.  --Wow, I didn't think It could get any worse!  Now, I realized I didn't do a good enough job.  I ended up burning my flesh with acid and carving my brain into pieces for my sanity back. This is GOD AWEFUL!  Simply Hell on Earth torture.  Singing commercials for a Corolla are better than this droning crap!<br /><br />  But hey.  In all fairness, I must say that I don't hate Mr. Loaf (or his fans)..  Just his music.  I love his personality on stage. He's got a lot of charisma energy, and that's awesome.  He was GREAT in ROCKY HORROR  by the way.  As sickening as this might sound to you,  I would go see him live,  just for the enlightment of his stage act.  ..maybe I'd leave early, who knows.<br /><br />  Anyways, this album?  Skip it.  It's '77, if you don't have it by now. Something told you that you already knew better.  There's nothing on here that you'll miss.  Three decent songs.  But notgood enough for repeat listening pleasure.  I give it 2 stars.  1 for the cover art.  It's cool. .....but it's misleading for the tone of the music.  Makes you think your getting a rock n roll album when your not.  plain and simple.  and 1 star for Mr. Loaf himself.<br /><br />P.S.  Mr. 2112 are you out there?  don't be afraid, I'd love to hear from ya...at listening pleasure.  I give it 2 stars.  1 for the cover art.  It's cool. .....but it's misleading for the tone of the music.  Makes you think your getting a rock n roll album when your not.  plain and simple.  and 1 star for Mr. Loaf himself.    P.S.  Mr. 2112 are you out there?  don't be afraid, I'd love to hear from ya...
1423101499|5.0|The Battle of the Labyrinth was a fun, adventurous read. This far into the series, if you've already read the first three books, this book is essential to completing the story.  Percy and his friends grow up a little more and just like the title implies, battles with monsters and villains.     I like how this adventure story is combined with Percy's experience growing up in the world. The juxtaposition of these elements is what makes the series work so well. I also liked how the quest in this story is not Percy's but he is still involved with the trek. I find most of the humor when the gods are involved and make their cameos. We get more development on character from those we met in the previous book, Percy meeting more of his family and struggling with his identity and meet new characters as well. Grover's quest also gets closure.     I thought Battle of the Labyrinth was the most melancholy of the series as it was punctuated with several sad scenes and a whopper of an ending, but there was also adequate humor. The story sets up the final book very well.
B000683VI4|5.0|I loved Noah's devotion to her especially all the way to the end of their lives.  Very touching.  I've watched it twice and cried both times. =)  It's best to watch it with the lights off, your phones off and no distractions.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|So my favorite album is \\"AWAKE.\\" But TRAIN OF THOUGHT is like the sister album to DT's seminal prog-metal opus. TOT is heavy, lyrically engaging, and musically berserk (of course). Absurdly enjoyable. Long live DT...
0446402397|5.0|This is a thriller than has it all--a unique setting, a compelling hero who evolves as the book progresses, and danger lurking around every corner.  Smith captures the oppression and paranoia of the Soviet Union toward the end of Stalin's reign in a dynamic story about a cop pursuing a serial killer in a Communist society that refuses to acknowledge that such crimes exist.  The hero breaks free of Soviet police orthodoxy at great risk to himself and his family to see that justice is done for the child victims.  The ending sags just a bit, but that does not detract from the overall power of the narrative.  The frigid Russian landscape is portrayed so vividly you might have to wear gloves and wool socks while reading this book.
B00000FCBC|5.0|This CD is awesome. I heard these songs on the radio and I never knew they were cover songs. It opens doors to listening and buying more music. Enjoy.
B00008ENTJ|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I used to listen to it all the time on our local college radio station. Interesting tidbit of information,did you know that one of the promos for the album cover was going to be a set of salt and pepper shakers tumbling down on the front cover? I absolutely love Supertramp and I really like Rodger Hodgson. He has that indistinguishable voice you would recognize anywhere. This is definitely a keeper in my album collection.
B001DPC52C|5.0|This was my absolute first time experiencing Within Temptation in any capacity. Listening to CD was a good introduction to an excellent group but watching the DVD was Great!  Until you see and hear this band perform live, in all their glory, you don't truly \\"experience\\" the magnitude of their abilities and their overall presence.   They are a combination of rock, classical rock and some opera and Gothic mixed in. They do it well. I plan to go back and experience their other CDs too now. The audio and video quality was superb. I highly recommend investing in this CD/DVD package. If you are new like me or a long time fan, it is well worth it.
1615230823|5.0|This is a great book. It is written very well and it addresses some issues that are sure to become talking points. The author draws on interesting research and brings it to life by sharing vibrant stories.
B002N1RM5A|5.0|The recording is superb. The modulation in the voice so bautiful fitting the text and music. Also the pianist is excellent. Highly recommend this recording for anyone who loves Schubert song cycles and the voice of Jonas Kaufmann.    Unfortunately this recording has several skips and I had to manual forward to the next song. I am not sure if this is only on this particular CD. I had already thrown away the packing slip and could not return it. Is there any way I could get a replacement?
1400052173|5.0|The author is able to capture the human essence behind science in this book that tackles many issues.  This book is the untold story of a woman is often forgotten in history that has made many of our medical marvels a reality. The author does a marvelous job of bringing to life this woman's story and showing you the person behind all the scientific data. It is written well, easy to understand, and next to impossible to set down for even a minute.<br />A problem that plagues society today is a lack of understanding behind scientific research. The general public often does not understand what scientists/researchers are saying when they begin spouting facts off like the genotypic frequency of the HPV2 gene is 3:1, as an example. (That is not an actual gene or actual frequency).  This book tackles that problem. The Lacks children were not educated enough to understand what little information doctors and scientist would give them, just like most people. The author is able to present the story of Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa cells in a humanizing way. She tells the story of the woman behind the cells, and the story and struggle of those that she left behind. People will be able to identify and relate to the people if this story as well as being able to understand some of the science behind this miraculous line of cells.

0060191325|2.0|Gray's motivation for the book is certainly noble: the idea that men and women need to better understand one another in order to foster healthy relationships. However, Gray's solution in \\"Men are From Mars and Women are From Venus\\" is to embellish upon large generalizations about men and women that really border on stereotypes which almost rings of sexism. Not sexism in the sense of putting someone down because they are a member of a particular sex, but in the sense of the idea that \\"all men do X\\" and \\"all women feel Y\\", as if human beings have ever so neatly fallen into such predictable patterns of behavior. If this were really true, then there shouldn't be any more human conflict because everything is quite identifiable. If there's anything that can be said about the human race, behavior, attitudes and beliefs are decidedly unpredictable. Trying to characterize them as predictable would be as naive as making the sames kinds of generalizations about people from particular religious affiliations.<br /><br />One of the primary hypothesese of his book is that \\"women talk\\" and \\"men go to their caves\\". For me, this is such a gross generality that disenfranchises a lot of males that I felt that the whole point of the book was simply relying on stereotypes. And stereotypes are often a fallacy, usually used as a way to simplify beliefs for people who do not want to engage in any real depth of understanding. It would be as bad to say that all Americans eat fast food. The kind of male he's describing seems like John Goodman from Roseanne or Jackie Gleason from the Honeymooners. Is this really about how to help relationships, or this only about propagating traits that are often reinforced on prime-time sit-coms? As a male myself, I was quite put off on how he characterizes men, as if all men somehow fit into some small threshold of behavior and attitudes that can easily be defined and labeled, which is almost as bad as stereotyping about people from other countries. I am a heterosexual male, and yet I have known very few men who engage in the sensibility that he describes. Most of the males I know certainly do not fit in with Gray's \\"men go to their caves\\". The book really is about a certain kind of male sensibility, essentially American, but for me it does an injustice to the vast array of differences between people.<br /><br />I won't disagree that there are temperamental differences between men and women and how they communicate. But when he makes statements like \\"men don't need women to say they love them after they're married\\" is absolute hogwash. It totally depends upon the man. I will concede that this is true for some males. But is it true for the vast majority? I know for example that European men view their own sexuality and relationships quite differently than we do in the United States. So how does that mesh with Gray's hypotheses? I think his characterizations of female sensibility is slightly better than that of men. Women do seem more eager to talk, and from a very early age, most females do exhibit a priority towards relationships and communication. But I don't think the direct opposite is necessarily true for men.<br /><br />The resulting work by Gray is a real disappointment as it characterizes a relatively segmented part of the male and female population, and tries to over-simplify many of the challenges faced by relationships. The problem of relationships may have more to do with two different people trying to get along than about stereotypical sex norms, but that's Gray's answer. It's actually very American in that sense. Americans want simple answers to complex problems. Sort of akin to when Americans found out that the French are healthier and drink red wine resulting in a red wine craze in the US. And maybe that's Gray's worst faux pas: making it seem like the answer to troubled relationships is simply knowing about a few sex stereotypes. Males and females are not stereotypes, pure and simple.al male, and yet I have known very few men who engage in the sensibility that he describes.

0307266303|5.0|John V. Karavitis  I loved this book!!!  I'm glad I came across it and decided to read it.  There's really not much that I can add that you can't quickly read for yourselves at the very top of this book's Amazon.com page, where the author answers basic questions about who/what/where/why of very-long distance running.  Basically, the author had a simple question:  \\"Why do I hurt when I run?\\"  The answer every doctor gave him, that running was bad for people, flew in the face of reports that he had heard about ultramarathoners, especially a mysterious Mexican tribe, the Tarahumara.  Along the way, the author (and we) learn the truth about the explosion of jogging in the United States, about Nike and Bill Bowerman (and his infamous book that started it all, \\"Jogging\\"), about why it hurts when people run (hint: it's the running shoes!  We don't need them!), about how we should be running, and, most amazing of all, the role that running after prey had on our own evolution.  The Tarahumara refer to themselves as \\"The Running People\\".  Well, guess what:  the entire Human Race is descended from runners who ran down prey to exhaustion!  We owe our evolution, and our brains, to running!  John V. Karavitis  This book's only failing, if you can call it that, is a lack of a training guide for someone who wants to pursue ultramarathons.  I was hoping that the author would give us a guide as to how to work one's way into running ultramarathons, the way they have training available for people who want to run regular marathons.  If it's any consolation (for those who think it's too late to do it), we also learn that, from age 19, a person reaches his maximum speed at about age 27.  Guess how old one is before one falls back to what one's speed level was at age 19: AGE 64!!!  \\"You don't stop running because you get old... You get old because you stop running!\\"  If you can endure the first half of this book, and its emphasis on the author's quest to discover the Tarahumara, you will be rewarded with a wealth of information on running and human evolution.  As a runner, I loved this book, and (as you'll understand when you read the book) I'll never look at a deer on the nature trail the same way again!  Five stars!  John V. Karavitis
B003JTHETY|5.0|I thoroughly refute and reject the reviews I have read that claim Maiden has run out of ideas, are out of energy, are just old, or other similar nonsense that people have stated.     It is one thing to not like the tendency of recent Maiden to open the majority of their songs with a slow intro.  Likewise, the over-all slower feel of many of the new songs won't be everyone's cup of tea. The length of their songs too can be grating to some that prefer fast, in your face, straight forward metal. Those types of comments are fair enough, but to disparage this complex album to the point of saying the band no longer cares is just incredible in my opinion.     This album has a bit of everything Maiden. Yes, many of the trends found in all the reunion albums are continued in The Final Frontier, and yet The Alchemist is a great old-school type Maiden song that would not be out of place (nor one of the weakest tracks) on any of the old \\"Big Three\\" Dickenson albums.  El Dorado reminds me a lot of Sea of Madness on Somewhere in Time. Many of the tracks have a Seventh Son feel about them.  The Talisman could very well be one of Maiden's best ever. The Man Who Would Be King completely blows me away with every unexpected turn.  I could go on and on...in fact there are only two songs on the record that I don't absolutely love, and I won't even bother mentioning which two because they aren't bad and could easily be someone else's favorites.     I think some of the apprehension people have with this work is that when songs tend to be long and with a progressive bent, it's sometimes hard to know just what the band is building up to. After a few earnest listens, the listener knows where it's all headed, and can revel in the climatic moments.  It's all a bit more complicated than one or two listens can reveal,  and truthfully takes a bit of work from the listener to  truly pay full dividends.  The way the album is mixed, listening to some of the songs is much like listening to classicalmusic, in that if you concentrate hard on one particular artist, there is a lot going on that is dreamily slipping just past your focus. I personally like this \\"soundscape\\" feel to the mix, but again it isn't necessarily easy listening.     So is all this work on the listener's part (not to mention the bands) worth it? Yes, yes, and yes! I love this album. I want you to buy this album and give it a fair try. I can't wait to put this cd in and listen to it after work, again and again...and again.     UP THE IRONS!
B002ONC9NC|5.0|I loved it, it is great condition and came in only a few days from across the country before a holiday! Thanks!1
B000002552|4.0|Personally I would have just made one excellent single album; a lot of material and marginal tracks, but the tunes like \\"Acapulco\\", \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere\\" and others make it a must listen for any hard core Band or Dylan fan.
B003QCCS3Q|5.0|I first heard LaMontagne on a local radio station a few years ago, and I've been a faithful devotee ever since.  That being said the album was incredibly consistent from beginning to end and tops some of his earlier work.  The vinyl edition is one of the nicest presentations I've had the pleasure to see in a while as well.  It's actually a 2 disk gatefold package using 180g vinyl.  Needless to say the vinyl is solid and is to last the next 50+ years with me, as I enjoy this regularly.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I was slightly skeptical at the sound quality of this headset prior to my purchase, but now I can admit to simply being blown away by the fidelity and accuracy of this headset.  No tweaking is needed to get perfect positional sound out of this guy.  It takes a game with amazing sound to truly exhibit its capabilities (ie Bad Company 2), and it is quite stunning.  Audio does not sound cramped or far away, but rather seems perfectly positioned - you feel as though you are in the midst of the action.  Footsteps, gunshots, even falling shell cases can be pinpointed with incredible accuracy.  The charging base isn't really a base for the headset, but rather a puck to coil the excess wiring and to connect the wireless receiver to.  It has more than enough length to use the headset comfortably while plugging it in to charge.    Pros:  Very comfortable, even for extended periods of use.  Sound is very clear, with beautiful, crisp highs and booming lows  Surround is perfect - no tweaking necessary!  Very good isolation.  Apparently ~9-10hrs of battery life (will update if it falls below/above that).  Very low price for what you get.    Cons:  Not much is out for the G buttons at the moment (an SDK is available from Logitech) - limiting their use, as you cannot set specific keys or macros.
B000024C7W|4.0|_Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants_ had three strikes against it.  It was a soundtrack album by a man who couldn't see the film; it was the overly expensive follow-up to _Songs in the Key of Life_, coming much too late to help out poor Motown; and it was about plants.  It has become famous as the album that knocked Stevie Wonder off his rails.      Yet anyone who takes Wonder seriously as a composer needs to revisit this album.  The movie itself (which I saw, and enjoyed, some years ago) is a quirky take on the world seen from the plants' point of view.  But by now, forget the film: the album has to be thought of as a separate entity.  Unfortunately, this removes the punch of the opening \\"orchestral selections,\\" which strike me as shaky and uninspired.   But once you get past that, there are beautiful melodies, wedded to unusual lyrics.  \\"Send One Your Love\\" is the best known, but other tunes (with those weird, plant-infected titles) are equally excellent: \\"Power Flower,\\" \\"Outside my Window,\\" \\"Come Back as a Flower,\\" \\"A Seed's a Star,\\" and the title track, \\"Secret Life of Plants.\\"  These are tunes I return to again and again--central to Wonder's artistic personality, and in their verbal content startlingly removed from the  travails of human love.       The single most unsettling track is \\"Race Babbling.\\"  The idea, in the film, is that plants are not static, but move much more slowly than we do.  Seen from their perspective, the human world is an incomprehensible, fast-forward blur.  (This portion of the film foreshadows the most disturbing parts of _Koyaanisqatsi_, with an equally disturbing, if less funky, score by Philip Glass.)  Drawing on harmonies at the edge of pop practice (part of Wonder's explorations of jazz),  Wonder pulls us into this world for nine solid minutes.   Frankly, I wish he'd do more of it--if for no other reason than to make the case that this composer has far, far more musical chops and artistic imagination than anyone drawn to \\"IJust Called to Say I Love You\\" can imagine.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Fortunately for me, I had heard nothing about inception, never saw an ad, didn't have a clue who was in it or what it was about. (no, I don't live under a rock.)It was a day off and my husband and I just decided to see a movie. He mentioned that he heard Inception was good, I just hoped that there was no gruesome killing, cursing and unnecessary sex scenes. And I was blown away. So the show is about a dream within a dream within a dream but it is about so much more. It is so interesting that that's all people seem to see about it. Usually having seen the trailers, I have a bit of an idea of what to expect so not knowing anything at all made me a truly unbiased viewer. The acting was sufficiently good to make the movie enjoyable, you can't escape the explosions and effects that is typical of the summer blockbuster. But what about the fact that it took Cobb the length of the entire movie to get over the fact that this dreaming nonsense killed his wife and made him lose his children. It takes the entire movie for him to finally face Mal and let her go. Truth is, this is what we do in dreams sometimes, they disturb us until we resolve it and sometimes you dream the resolution. I have certainly dreamt of hidden locations of things I had been searching for in reality. So I rate this a great movie, not just for the actors and the effects but that within it all we were able to see a man really achieve goals on both levels, he planted the thought in Fisher's mind to complete the final job and he was able to move past the hurdle that Mal represented. So even if the entire movie was a dream, it was a supreme success on all counts. To accomplish all that in one movie is phenomenal and regardless of what you compare it with, it deserves all the accolades it gets.
B002RWKSII|5.0|I am in my 20's and I have listened to Brian's music since I was 9. Since I am Swedish I have not heard any of Gershwin's songs before, so this is a new experience to me. I am not able to compare Brian's versions to the original versions.    The album's production is even better than what we heard on SMiLE and Brian's voice is better than in 35 years. The best songs on this album are I Got Rhythm, Nothing But Love and The Like in I Love You.    I am so glad Brian teamed up with Scott, Darian, Jeff, Probyn, Paul, Taylor and the rest of the gang. They have really made Brian come alive. Now we are waiting for the upcoming (world) tour.     Who could ask for anything more (after hearing the tag of I Got Rhythm)?
B003JTHESA|3.0|A 30 year Maiden supporter, (since 1981), I've always been loyal to Maiden, and I always will be. With that stated, here's my opinion of their latest release \\"The Final Frontier\\". It's way too long, WAY TOO LONG! Then there's Bruce, he doesn't sound good, he's really struggling here. On top of that, most of the songs never go anywhere, {at least not anywhere that interests me}. Sure, there might be a few tracks here that are decent, but compared to \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\", this was a major disappointment to my ears. Although I wouldn't rate \\"The Final Frontier\\" as Maiden's worst effort to date, {Dance Of Death still holds that spot}, it's certainly nowhere near their previous masterpiece {AMOLAD}. I only hope they can rebound from this, and put out another winner sometime in the near future, because this one falls short I'm afraid...    ~MJ~
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Wow, I was pleasantly surprised - I knew Gaga was good, but this has surpassed all my expectations - this is not only a solid follow-up to the Fame, this is an EXCELLENT follow-up!     She writes memorable tunes and is clearly gifted at it. I highly recommend this album - I can't wait for her next full-length album. She deserves all her fame and fortune, what a musical genius.
1572704772|4.0|I have to say that this audio book accomplishes a very great deal for being only 2 CDs long, worth mentioning.  I also wanted to remark on how perfectly David Suchet captures the wide variety of characters involved.  I also find reviewers noting the visual acuity of this area, with its craggy bays, caves and cliffs: Christie does very well in capturing the allure of the area in this work.  I was less pleased with what felt like a somewhat forced resolution, which felt insufficiently developed.  Still, predictability is to be avoided in all matters mysterious, and so I can give it 4 stars of 5.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Excellent value for blu-ray disc!  Product arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  The video itself is great!  Michael Jackson was a genious in the preparations and directions for this documentary.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|This is a solid CD release titled \\"Magic\\" by the legendary rocker Bruce \\"The Boss\\" Springsteen in 2007, 5 years since last release with The E - Street Band, \\"The Rising\\" & 2 years since his solo effort \\"Devils & Dust). Both of these albums [\\"The Rising\\",\\"Devils & Dust\\" & \\"Magic\\"] are produced by the legendary Brendan O'Brien. The Tracks : 1.\\"Radio Nowhere\\" - a surprising, up tempo & eerie but good opening track, let you know \\"The Boss\\" is in a different mood but signaling that he has arrived (rated 4 stars).  2.\\"You'll Be Comin' Down\\" - an excellent second solid track (rated 5 stars).  3.\\"Livin' In The Future\\" - ordinary song (rated 3 stars).  4.\\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" - a weak song (rated 2 stars).  5.\\"Gypsy Biker\\" - a good pacy song (rated 4 stars).  6.\\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\" - a good laid back track, did win a video award (rated 3 stars).  7.\\"I'll Work For Your Love\\" - a great love melodic song (ballad) with very persuasive lyrics \\"The pages of Revelation lie open in your empty eyes of blue; I watch you slip that comb through your hair, and this I promise you : I'll work for your love, dear ; I'll work for your love; What others may want for free, I'll work for your love\\" (rated 5 stars).  8.\\"Magic\\" - a good title track (rated 3 stars).  9.\\"Last To Die\\" - an ok song (rated 3 stars).  10.\\"Long Walk Home\\" - my favourite song from this album, a beautiful number, sweet melody & great lyrics to boot \\"In town I passed Sal's grocery; The barbershop on South Street; I looked into their faces; They were all rank strangers to me; The veterans' hall high up on the hill; Stood silent and alone; The diner was shuttered and boarded; With a sign that just said \\"gone\\" (rated 5 stars). This is my favourite track from this great album & hence the title of my review.  11.\\"Devil's Arcade\\" - a dark ok song (rated 3 stars).     Overall rating comes to a well deserved 4 stars, a highly recommended listening by this legendary prolific multi-grammy singer-songwriter, Bruce Springsteen.

B0014127BO|4.0|This is an excellent Bryan Adams's eleventh album release aptly titled \\"11\\" [Eleventh album & eleven songs]. This album sees the return of long time Bryan Adams's collaborators Jim Vallance as co-composer & the legendary Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange as co-producer of the album, co-composer & bass guitarist (on one song \\"We Found What We Were Looking For\\"). This is Bryan Adams's best album by far since the great 1996 CD release \\"18 Til I Die\\". Tracks : 1.\\"Tonight We Have The Stars\\"- great song opening track (composed by Bryan Adams, Jim Vallance & Peters, rated 4 stars).  2.\\"I Thought I'D Seen Everything\\" - In this hit Bryan Adams shows why he is regarded by many as king of ballads, my favourite song from this CD, hence the title of my review (composed by Bryan Adams, Eliot Kennedy & Mutt Lange, rated 5 stars).  3.\\"I Ain't Losin' The Fight\\" - great song (composed by BA, EK & ML, rated 4 stars).  4.\\"Oxygen\\" - great song (composed by BA, EL & ML\\", rated 3 stars).  5.\\"We Found What We Were Looking For\\" - ordinary song (composed by BA, ML & Trevor Rabin, rated 2 stars).  6.\\"Broken Wings\\" - great song (composed by BA & EK, rated 4 stars).  7.\\"Somethin' To Believe In\\" - ok song (composed by BA & EK, rated 3 stars).  8.\\"Mysterious Ways\\" - ok song (composed by BA & P, rated 3 stars).  9.\\"She's Got A Way\\" - great song & lyrics \\"I feel so naked - I feel so totally exposed; It's such a mystery, how she seems to know, every part of me; I feel so shaken - and it's like everybody knows whenever she touches me, no one else can feel, as much as me; Ya she's got away\\" (composed by BA & EK, rated 5 stars).  10.\\"Flower Grown Wild\\" - ok song (composed by BA, JV & P, rated 3 stars).  11.\\"Walk On By\\" - a wonderful laid back closing track (composed by BA & JV, rated 5 stars).

142313494X|3.0|While the language may be \\"hip,\\" it lacks . . . ummm . . . pretty much anything realistic, exciting, suspensfull, enlightening, or intriguing.

B003JTHETY|4.0|I've been a fan for 22 years now, own every album and have seen them 8 times in concert. I have to admit I was one of those nostalgic fans who had lost touch with Maiden during the 1990's when Dickinson and Smith were gone. I then only really started listening to them again around the time their second \\"reunion album\\" Dance of Death was released and have since enjoyed their three 2000s albums... Ok enough about me, just stating where I'm coming from...    Now about Final Frontier... I must admit that during the first listen I was feeling like saying \\"what the hell is this?\\"... and sarcastically thinking \\"Oh great this is their last album, you gotta be kidding\\"...     Listened to it a second time while jogging the next day and I started hearing things lol no not voices but just a few \\"Wow\\" moments in riffs, arrangements, solos, etc... \\"Hmmm there are some great galloping parts as well on this...\\"    Third listen I am getting it more... Some really good moments.. Some good songs... \\"Yes now this is a great album after all!\\"    I must be on my 6th or 7th listen now and I must say I am thoroughly enjoying this album... There are some good songs with even greater moments in them. <  My only disappointment now is that sometimes I find that there are songs whose segments / arrangement / bridges could easily have been made main riffs for the entire song which would then have propelled it to, dare I say, hit single status...     ... An example of this is in the song The Man Who Would be King. I'd have scrapped the slow intro and made the segment of 3:57 to 5:00 be the prominent part of the song. To me I feel they sometimes could sustain these \\"ups\\" much longer rather than transitioning 4-5 times per song... I remember feeling the same way about AMOLAD's The Legacy's segment from 3:09 to 5:10... Maybe it's just me?    Also, although I like the overall sound mix, I feel certain sections could have been engineered to put emphasis on that section's groove... e.g., make some guitar parts stand out more, etc... But hey, I'm no Kevin Shirley...     In any case, this is just me sharing my opinion. All in all, a good album with many great parts to it, well worth getting...
B0000074CU|5.0|This is an excellent CD of the late Rory Gallagher at his best at the Aisle of Wight festival. Both the classics, \\"Catfish\\" and \\"Sugar Mama\\" are included as well as \\"What's Going On.\\"
B00386EZJU|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the BEST soundtracks I have ever heard. I am am instrumental score fanatic, and it's rare that I come across anything original these days. John Powell's score will make you epically heart-heavy to wondrously hopeful and what more can one ask for with music??? (The movie rocks, too!) If there were six stars, I would rate it that. You will not be disappointed!
006145205X|5.0|It seems like there's always a market for doom and gloom, even though, for the most part, things have gotten much, much better for humanity over the past few centuries and even the past few decades. In THE RATIONAL OPTIMIST, Matt Ridley seeks to correct the record and point out that, hey, things are getting better, mostly because we're good at working together.<br /><br />Ridley, who's written extensively about evolution, argues that innovation happens-and people become better off-when ideas have sex, that is, when people are allowed to trade technical, social, and philosophical concepts with each other. Like organism that use sexual reproduction, the ideas that result have a bit of each of their \\"parents\\" and are able to adapt to changing conditions. It's a thought-provoking metaphor, to say the least.<br /><br />Based on the title and what little I'd read of the blurb, I expected something pretty narrowly focused on the last 50 years or so. Instead, the book takes the reader far, far back to the dawn of human history, drawing on archaeological and anthropological evidence in support of Ridley's thesis, that cooperation and specialization are what creates prosperity. Ridley's clearly in the Hayek mold, stressing the importance of spontaneous order rather than top-down dictates in innovation and the creation of wealth. Sometimes, he over-reaches-I can't join in his admiration for the Phoenicians after learning that they practiced infanticide-and he too often pauses the narrative to take gratuitous potshots at government and religion-the latter is particularly unfortunate, because I'd guess that a creed that teaches \\"don't do unto your neighbor what is hateful to you\\" would be a pre-requisite for or at least a boon to the cooperation that builds specialization and therefore prosperity.<br /><br />On the whole, though, there's a great deal in THE RATIONAL OPTIMIST to like. The idea that trade, rather than war, has spurred innovation and human development, sounds too good to be true, but Ridley marshals strong evidence to prove his thesis. He makes some valid points about the desirability of urban life-even urban poverty-over rural poverty, and insists that a return to \\"self-sufficiency\\" would be disastrous for humanity, particularly the poorer segments of it. Advocates of the hundred-mile diet might think twice about limiting their options to locally-grown produce when they read that trade in agricultural products is essential to raising the standard of living in developing countries.<br /><br />In short, THE RATIONAL OPTIMIST argues that we are all better off when we cooperate, and that things are likely to keep getting better if we keep working together-a feel-good idea, maybe, but one that we can't afford to ignore.ood to be true, but Ridley marshals strong evidence to prove his thesis.

B003Y3BSTC|4.0|Foundations of GMAT Math is a review of basic math principles. If you picked a GMAT Math book and having a hard time with it, this book is for you. Prepare to see pie charts explaining factions, multiplications table, explanations of what a multiple or prime is and how to factor numbers. If you have not faced math (or were afraid to) in the past 5 years, this book is for you. Here are some important facts:    PROS:  - Very thorough  - Great coverage of coordinate geometry  - Helpful and valuable divisibility and exponents section  - TONS of bonus questions online (400+ of GMAT-format questions)  - Have not verified every question, but hoping for quality unlike Kaplan Math Foundations book (which i regrettably gave 5 stars but amazon does not allow changing ratings)    CONS:  - QUITE A FEW ERRORS (please see MGMAT's website for the errata)  - The book has 400 practice questions but they are not in a GMAT format, rather a math-textbook format  - Long! 300 full-size pages - I think the expectation is that you skip parts that you know  - Some shortcuts (such as diamond method of solving quadratic equations) are confusing to those educated in formal math (but then those probably won't be using this book)  - Easy (i know it is supposed to be), but still - only easy questions    Bottom line: if you are comfortable with other MGMAT books, this book is probably not for you. If you are uneasy about math, give this book a try - you don't regret it. It is fantastic value for the 800 questions it offers. Would also recommend you pick up [[ASIN:0982423845 Number Properties]] and [[ASIN:098242387X Word Translations]] by Manhattan GMAT. If you have purchased a full Manhattan GMAT set of books and hesitating between this book and Kaplan's version, definitely get this one - it integrates better.    For reference, here are the topics covered by the book:  1. Equations  2. Quadratic equations  3. Word problems  4. Divisibility - very helpful  5. Exponents and roots - helpful as well  6. Fractions  7. Fractions, decimals, and percents  8. Beyond equations  9. Geometry (very extensive section)      BB, GMAT 750  Founder of GMAT Club

B002UXRGM0|5.0|Not much to add here... the reviewers have said it all. I just want to say that I enjoyed every minute of footage and narration, and the behind the scenes chapters are really amazing. I will probably watch it many times in the future. It is a must to have.
B00337KM2S|4.0|After a while, it gets pretty tiring to have nearly every Hollywood movie either overtly or subtly suggest that real happiness lies in marriage and family.  I love this movie because it asks us to consider that happiness is personal, not cookie-cutter.  The protagonist loves his life of traveling and the lack of ties that go along with it. Some might see this as melancholy, and at times it is portrayed that way in the movie, but overall, it's clear that what most people want is not what the protagonist wants. I love the realistic, insightful way that this different outlook on life is presented in this movie.

0316067938|5.0|I have to say that I got into the Twilight series by curiousity. I had seen the first two movies and thought that the acting was sub-par and that they were not that great. However, my friends that kept dragging me to these movies said the books are much better so naturally I bought the first 3 in paperback and began my exploration.    Overall I think the story is much better and the series as a whole is a lot better in the book form. Go figure. So when the fourth and final book was to be released in August in soft cover I placed my pre-order and waited to see how things would end up. Let's just say that the wait was worth it. I finished the book in a few days and really liked this book's story. A little more racey and all, but definitly a good finale. Now as for how the last two-part movies will go, only time will tell.
0739367676|5.0|I just love the audio book I got. The \\"Breaking Dawn\\" book. I never read so this is why I tried the audio cd's. I take trips alot and now instead of listening to music, I can have a book read to me. It really makes time go by faster when driving. And the people that read to you does a really great job in doing so.
B003JTHESA|5.0|This is a progressive album, so if you don't like progressive music, don't buy it!  I am putting in this review to up the average rating.  I guess some fans don't like long songs with time shifts, I find it entertaining- keeps the song from getting boring.  I am sure the band does not want to recreate the same damn album over and over again.  The best thing they could have done is lean towards the progressive/theme side.  And for all the folks that scream they like the older shorter songs, maybe they don't like Phantom of the Opera, Powerslave or Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  If you want speed-listen to Slayer (I love Slayer by the way), but if you want more thought provoking music with a harder edge, listen to this disc- MANY TIMES!!!     Oh yeah- what's with people slamming Satellite 15?  I think it sounds great and would be great show opener.  I could go on and on. But I don't want to keep repeating what others that support the cd have said.    Cheers!!
0307341569|4.0|I found this book to be interesting and different.    I am a fan of crime and murder/mystery books, and this falls into that category, but it is more than that.  It's the story of a young girl who survives a brutal attack that kills her entire family, but it is actually more about the after shocks that it creates in her life as she is growing up.  The author does a good job of keeping the story well paced, through the use of flashbacks to tell the back story.      Overall, it is a bit dark, and a bit bloody, and a bit macabre, but that is what makes it different in my opinion.    Nice read.
0545123267|3.0|I just finished Shiver a few days ago. It took me a few months to finish. I have read a lot and I have read advanced books and young adult books. I couldn't get into this one so I would set it aside forget about it and then see it and say oh I forgot to finish that book. So I would go back read a few pages get bored and set it aside. As a writer myself it didn't take long before I relized why I was bored with it. One there was way too much detail that didn't need to be there. Two not enough dialog which might be okay for some readers but not me. It was a teen romance about wolves and a human girl and well not being a teenager anymore maybe I just couldn't grasp all the teenage stuff anymore. The romance was confusing just like Twilight. I couldn't figure out why Sam the wolf by winter human by summer boy and Grace the human girl in love with the wolf loved each other apart from he saved her from the wolf pack when she was a child. They were making out less than twenty four hours from when they met each other. It seemed like the first half of the book was dragging by and then it seemed like the author figured out it was time to finish the novel and finally got to the quick paced ending. It was a good ending I enjoyed it. I don't think I will purchase the second or third novel. If I want to read it I will check it out at the Library and I recomend others doing so. All in all it was an okay book for teens who seem to love it. I was just not so thrilled with it.
B000RZGFZC|5.0|How is it this album and \\"South of Heaven\\" only have like 14 reviews a piece? For me, This is the best Thrash/speed or whatever you want to call it metal album ever. (Well, It's either this one or \\"Master of Puppets\\" and that IS a tough call). I was 16 when \\"Seasons\\" came out, and I can say it had a profound affect on me. It changed my life and helped shape the man I am today (along with many other albums but you get what I'm saying). This was Slayer at their best. Not to take anything away from \\"Reign in Blood\\" or \\"South of Heaven\\" but those ablums lead up to this one. this is the album where everything came together perfectly. Oh, and thank god I've never had to go to war. But if i ever did have to march into battle unsure of the outcome. \\"Skeletons of Society\\" would be the song I would play.
0143118420|1.0|I really need to work on my ruthlessness and re-read my Machiavelli. I honestly don't mean the following disrespectfully and would like to learn more. I do not understand how (some) women can promote Gilbert or this book or respect her, etc... when, and I am intentionally generalizing here, nearly any woman would condemn or otherwise slander a man who did the exact same things. I know alot of piece of crap men. But, even the worst ones I've met have a \\"cat that ate the canary\\" look on their faces when they get caught doing bad things. But, (some) women are just above my comprehension when it comes to mind games. From my admittedly less cunningly evolved point of view, it seems as if (some) women can actually convince themselves that they (or other women) or their views are moral, upstanding, caring, etc... despite any actions, even unprovoked, that if a man did they would despise him for. I really want to know if anyone can tell me. Is it self-deception? Is it that you consider men lesser beings therefore less deserving of rights and respect? Is it a general contempt for men? I honestly don't get it and if anyone could give me some insight I would much appreciate it. (Note: if you just wanna down me or use shaming language PLEASE just save your response).
078062582X|2.0|What could have been a great character study - a Feminist determined to provide her daughter with a wholesome life while she watches Mom take her clothes off on stage; who still fights an impulse towards exhibitionism - emerges as foolish, pandering pulp.<br /><br />So we have a great writer and two fine actors (Moore and Reynolds) delivering something pretty embarassing. Reynolds is awful as the sleazy politician who has his own urge to drop his pants in public.<br /><br />That said, Demi Moore is *the* reason to watch this movie, beginning to end. She acts well, and dances even...weller.

1433502445|5.0|I began the search for a good study bible about six months ago.  I was hesitant to choose this one at first because of my unfamiliarity with the ESV translation.  My main bible has always been the NIV.  However after reviewing many other study bibles I kept coming back to this one due it's wealth of information.  The paper quality and binding seems superior to most other bibles I've looked at and the full color illustrations are very helpful.  There are also excellent theological and historical articles in the back that I've been devouring.  The book introductions are also in depth and informative.  As far as the translation goes, I do prefer the way the NIV words some passages better than the ESV, but on other hand I do appreciate the more literal word-for-word formal equivalence translation style of the ESV.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Like other reviewers and Beatle People, I'm wondering why this is being hailed as a \\"new release\\" when most of us bought this the last time it was released a few years ago.<br /><br />If there were any new bonus features or additional footage, I imagine they they would be touting those in the promotional material. So far, I've seen none.<br /><br />This leads me to believe that the licensing rights to the original Ed Sullivan tapes has changed hands, and the new licensees have given it a new package and put it out.<br /><br />If anyone here buys/watches this, please post to let us know if there is anything new or different about this release.<br /><br />Thanks!

B001TZQITM|3.0|Overall, this bag is pretty useful. While the side pockets are a bit small to store anything of real use (perhaps an SD card would fit), the main compartment is great to use. I particularly like the top fold-away storage \\"hammock.\\" I've actually used this bag to store my portable MP3 player devices, carrying accessories and a portable headphone amplifier in the main compartment and the player in the top pouch. It's great to take on a plane for this purpose.

0525423842|2.0|I've read Grisham.  I've read more mysteries for 3-5th graders however.  I frequently don't finish books that move slowly, this I did manage to finish.  Grisham's main character Theo is interesting enough, but enough dosen't happen to HIM.  He's not enough of a kid.  There is no typical Grisham style here except for a few pages at the very end.  As a librarian I won't be pushing this one.
B003JTHETY|4.0|Edit:  While I had listened through this album a bunch of times before my first review, I have to add that after it has settled a little longer, I find myself holding this album in contempt for its crappy production.  Come on, guys, such great tunes deserve better mixing and recording job. Whole solos are botched by mediocre mixing (see Man who would be King and Starblind)       After listening through most of the album on youtube, buying the album, and then listening through it about 12 times over on a road trip, I have found that this album is phenomenal. The end half of the album has stabilized it as one of my very favorite Maiden albums (right behind Powerslave and Somewhere in Time)    Steve Harris seemed to have addressed some complaints with the album.  I liked AMOLAD, but it was longwinded and repetitive.  I cannot listen through it all the way through AMOLAD without feeling like an eternity has passed.  This new album feels like it goes by in a flash; my girlfriend noted that it felt like her song (The Man Who Would Be King) came on every twenty minutes on our road trip when I didn't even skip a track.  The next point is that only a couple tracks have the super repetitive chorus', Final Frontier and Mother of Mercy.    It is important to know that the album starts out relatively slow, and somewhat predictable; Final Frontier, El Dorado, Mother of Mercy, and Coming Home are more or less standard run-of-the-mill modern Maiden tracks that hold a hint of Bruce solo material.  The album really kicks off with The Alchemist, a faster-paced throwback to Piece of Mind and Powerslave era, which preludes the epics of the album.     The beginning of this album will fall in with the Iron Maiden curve.  These are songs that may have all seemed to be spectacular tracks if Iron Maiden did not already have such a high average of great tracks. This album will truly be known for the second half of the album, the epics.    Isle of Avalon is a SSOASS esque epics that sets an ethereal and surreal atmosphere that builds towards a very original and trippy solo section.    Starblind is a little bit more rocking, with some sabbath like riffs, and more great and original soloing.    Talisman is contextually like the sequel to Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but sounds more like a mixture of the songs Dance of Death and The Legacy.  Most epic vocals on the album, it gives me shutters every time.    \\"The Talisman is in My Hand\\"  (duh- duh duh- dadadadah)     The Man Who Would Be King.  Pretty rocking with another very original solo section that truly utilizes Murray's hammer-ons and offs.     When The Wild Wind Blows.  a huge, but kinda softish epic with more awesome solos and some whammy-bar wailings.     Oh, and Mission Edition is not worth it at all.
B000TSIK14|5.0|i,ve been a Scorpions fan from the 70,s and have pretty much heard everything from the early stuff till when they became commercial in the states and this cd kicks butt. One of those cd,s that is great from beginning to the end! One of my favorites from them!
B002U0KHMY|4.0|\\"White Collar: Season One\\" contains the 14 episodes of the first season of USA Network's clever summer cable program.  \\"White Collar\\" stars Matt Bomer as the charming Neal Caffrey, master forger and art thief, out of prison on parole to work with the FBI.  Caffrey's keeper is straight arrow FBI Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), the man responsible for putting Caffrey away in the first place.  The two men will forge an unlikely partnership to track down other art thiefs, forgers, and smugglers.  Tiffany Amber Thiessen has a supporting role as Agent Burke's wife.<br /><br />\\"White Collar\\" works on several levels.  Burke and Caffrey have some trust issues to work through.  Caffrey may want to stay out of prison, but he is dangerously obsessed with an off-the-books quest to find his missing ex-girlfriend, who may or may not want to be found.  Caffrey gets help on his quest from shifty former partner Mozzie (Willie Gerson).  Not everyone at the FBI is overjoyed with Caffrey's presence; an FBI Agent named Fowler is out to put Caffrey back behind bars.  Neal may also have a few enemies left from his old days on the street.<br /><br />The \\"White Collar\\" storylines are predictable but entertaining. What really sells the show is the interaction between the characters and their separate agendas.  \\"White Collar\\" is highly recommended as a funny, smart take on the traditional police procedural.
B002YICN74|5.0|This album offer something different from other Jonas Brothers'albums. It's more  mature and able to reach outside Jonas Brothers' audiences like me. I live in the other part of globe, in Archipelagos country of Indonesia and coincidentaly listen to \\"WHO I AM\\" song in YouTUBE. Thought of purchase one for my daughter but when I listen to the songs, I like them all myself.  It's a great music and lyrics..looking forward to listen more solo's of Nick Jonas. A very talented young man.
B001HN6940|4.0|I did not see the original and I did not see any form of remake of this movie before this version. I have to say that the movie is a very good watch and I'm glad that we purchased it because it's good enough to watch once or twice a month or just to put on in the background instead of music. The only thing I can say is that the soundtrack was good but not many of the songs actually appeared in the movie which was sort of disappointing.    This might not be a 'classic' like I hear the original is, but it's a good movie nonetheless!
B001CZJKS0|1.0|Okay...maybe I'm just dumb, but why wouldn't a 30 year anniversary box set contain ALL of the releases over the past 30 years, whether stellar, crappy or or just a decent waste of time?  Why not include the extended \\"TV\\" version of Halloween along with the modified \\"TV\\" version of Halloween II (doesn't exist on VHS or disc), along with all the original theatrical realeases thru Resurrection (all in Hi-Def, with Blu-Ray counterparts)?  THAT, to me, would be a true 30th anniversary box set.  5 stars for Halloween and Halloween II, 4 stars for Halloween H20 (#7), 3 stars for #3 (Season of the Witch), 4, 5 (never watched #6), and Resurrection (#8), and honestly 4 stars overall for the entire series--I know, it doesn't average out right, but honestly it is a fun series despite the huge cheesy acting factor in most of the films.  Are they waiting for the 50th anniversary to do that?  We won't care anymore.  1 star for what they've done to the fans with this ridiculous box set.<br /><br />Sorry, but I'd rather collect these individually and put them in a regular box.  :-P<br /><br />Side note: has anyone ever noticed that Rodney Dangerfield's English professor (Dr. Diane Turner played by Sally Kellerman) in the 1986 comedy hit Back to School lived in the Doyle house (from Halloween and Halloween II)?  LOL!  No wonder they had a \\"dead man's party!\\"  No trick here!  Just a tiny piece of trivia treat.  Check it out.

1400052173|4.0|This story amazed me. Not being involved in the medical field in any way, I had no idea about how cells grow or don't grow, how the use of a person's cells is or is not regulated, or how important Henrietta Lack's cells have been to medical science. This part in the beginning of the book was very informative. The information on how black people were treated, used for experiments, not advised about health conditions, and such, even this was informative.  However, I believe the book could have been about half as long as it turned out had the author condensed some of the human interest parts of the book. She repeats herself in many places; that is not necessary and just made the book longer. Also, in my opinion, the Lacks family and extended family was shown to be quite ignorant about so many things. The author really should have presented the interactions with family in a more empathetic light. Not untruthfully, mind you, but have more empathy with the family's lack of education and their ignorance of medical technology. If the author would have taken the approach that was taken by the Johns Hopkins lab researcher who showed Deborah and Zakariiya the cells under a microscope and gave them some basic explanations they could understand, I think there would have been less animosity on the part of the family members. All in all, I think the author did a great job with these exceptions.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Toy Story was my all-time favorite movie when it first came out, and Im 22 now and it still is to this day, it still blows my mind that they made a 3rd one!! Toy Story 3 was such an incredibly awesome movie (no doubts that it would be any different), and I lit up like I was a kid again when Woody (my favorite character) first walked on the screen. TS3 is an amazing and perfect ending to an unbelievably awesome franchise, and I cannot wait to own it! Itll be my first ever Blu-Ray purchase, and who could ask for a better first!
B00127RAJY|5.0|EDIT as of 11-2-12:<br />I still LOVE this workout!  I only do level 1...level 2 and 3 are too difficult for me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this and still give it 5 stars, but my only qualm with it is that it makes my knees hurt and the bridge of my feet hurt from lunges (which might be part of me having not proper shoes?).  But it's a great workout, indeed.  Just be careful.<br /><br />I am reading how so many people actually do this daily.  Honestly, that's not me.<br /><br />1. I get bored.<br /><br />2. As a person who used to workout 7 days a week, I know the importance of alternating \\"weight-lifting\\" days with cardio.<br /><br />and 3.  I have not nearly enough time as I used to.<br /><br />I do not own the DVD, but a roomie of mine does...and exercise tv on-demand has it too.<br /><br />I am in my late 20's...and I would say I'm average-build.  I used to be very athletic (still am, just haven't had time to do sports), and I used to work-out often...but lack of money and time has bitten me in butt and now I have to get what I can.  And when I have my one day off from working...I wanna be home, and not go to the gym.  This work-out is INCREDIBLE.  And it's SHORT!<br /><br />She gets you working you tail off, that's for sure.  And I, so far, have done the level one work-out about one or two times per week.  I NEVER do those back-to-back...you really need to give your muscles a break if you are using weights.  But you don't need to be doing this daily to SEE results.  I suppose it does depend on your body and age...but even I have noticed significant changes in my physical appearance.<br /><br />As a rule, I never go by weight.  I never weigh myself...I usually find it difficult, discouraging, and just plain annoying.  I go by how my clothes feel on me...and how my back-fat looks when I look in a mirror.  And let me tell you, after doing this maybe 1 or 2 times per week...for about a month...my arms are getting more definition: the \\"wings\\" are disappearing onmy arm.  And I have chronic neck and back pain, and when I do this video...it seems to be improving how even THAT feels.  Because my back and neck even are building some more muscle...which is very important to hold where my chiropractor adjusts my spine.  (it won't work without strong back and neck muscles)<br /><br />Even my legs have tightened up...back-fat and the muffin-top is FINALLY going away.  Now, do know that you probably should watch what you eat.  DO NOT DIET.  I'm against diets.  It's all about moderation.  I don't eat more than 2 fried things per week...although I eat out 2-3 times per week.  ONE DESSERT per day.  Not a huuuuge one...but one that is satisfying.  I've found that apples dipped in caramel help, and those skinny cow truffle bars are sinfully good!  I don't know how much calories I intake...it's ridiculous to count.  I KNOW under 2000...but just keep an eye on your food...do this about ONE or two times per week.  And you will see some differences!!!<br /><br />Try it out...20 minutes is worth it... doesn't hurt, eh?<br /><br />(OH, and DO be careful with your knees...mine are somewhat weak...but you really have to be aware of how to not injure yourself while doing squats or lunges.  Straight back...and never let your knees go over your ankles.  AND DO THE MODIFIED VERSIONS Jillian gives you...if you have issues...there's no shame in starting small).

It is easy to read and doesn't waste any time getting to the point.  This book tells you things you already know but are just too stubborn to admit in a way that finally makes sense. If I could only read one book to start my creative juices flowing it would be this one.
B003JTHESA|1.0|Except unlike say the orginal Star Wars series, this began with No Hope in the form of Dance of Death and ended with The Emperor winning in the Final Frontier with the Return of the Maiden Death Star studio.     The rebellion lost all interest in fighting the Maiden studio battleship, simply turned the sound down and let them alone in their part of the galaxy.     The Emperor has decided he won't go out in a final display of his skills but instead wither away and die out of old age. Millions have nevertheless turned out for his performances but no one has the courage or the intelligence to tell him he has no clothes on.    What this means for Anakin Skywalker is that he will never be turned back to the good side of the force where he may yet hear good music and learn to tell the difference between good and bad. He will instead live out his days continuing to be tormented and learn to like it like he has for many years.    Luke has been banished, being told that he isn't a true Maiden fan and awaits a sentence where he will most likely be thrown into a Bantha pit.    So what next for the empire, now that the dark side holds the upper hand? What of the rest of the galaxy?    The imbalance in the force continues...

B003K3OF78|2.0|Nothing much to add that others haven't said. I just wanted to have my 2-star rating counted. If you want the old Keane, download songs 4, 6 and 8, skip the rest. Not sure if the additional $2 more for the whole album is worth it for the digital booklet...<br /><br />Sad to see that this promising band prefers to regurgitate \\"fake synth-clap\\" 80s crap music (except track 7, which sounds like a bad 70s / rap mix) instead of being innovative and successful.<br /><br />No wonder that it's an Amazon exclusive download. iTunes probably didn't want it....

B0032FPVKE|5.0|Amazon is forging ahead with new product lines and the latest offering shows that they are seriously entering yet another market with difficult-to-beat prices.    It's a very small bag, to be sure, but if you're looking for a bag for an outside \\"for-the-day\\" excursion that is light, unobtrusive, and practical for both small camcorder/digital camera use, then you can't beat this one.  It's got enough room for your recent offerings of camcorders and digital camera (low/mid-range consumer level) with enough space for spare batteries, memory cards, etc.    At a price that's nearly half of other brand offerings (i.e. Case Logic), it's hard not to pass this up.  I've used it a few times and just having something this light and durable is a relief when I just need something for a short period of time.  Just don't expect to have it hold something as large as, say, a charger.  Keep that in mind when you're shopping this bag.
B003S897UK|5.0|Great show recorded in Atlanta, GA at the turn of the millennium.  Fantastic set list and even better performances by the Mule and special guests.  Buy this one now if you love live music.
B003X73QA8|4.0|Not since Neil Peart of Rush explored the depths of suburban alienation in \\"Subdivisions\\" has a band tackled the topic with such insight.    Arcade Fire takes listeners on a ride through the suburbs, and each track takes up the theme in some way.    For me, \\"Suburban War\\" stands out.  Lyrically, it tells the story of two friends growing up in the suburbs who ultimately go their own ways.  First, they grow their hair long together.  Later, \\"you cut your hair; I never saw you again.\\" Musically, it begins with Byrds'-like guitar plucking and ends with impassioned drumming as the story moves to a close -- \\"my old friends, they don't know me now.\\"  It may not get the radio play of other tracks on the release, but it's clearly the best song.    Overall, it's an excellent release for Arcade Fire.  The band's style defies categorization at times.  One song sounds like Kate Bush; others sound like an indie band on its way to growing up.    I like most of the tracks but could do without \\"Rococo,\\" which seems like a throwaway song.  With 16 tracks on the release, they could have left this one out.    Arcade Fire have produced a praiseworthy release worthy of the attention they are now getting, having been somewhat below the radar.
B000001DVD|5.0|Hands down the best lep album ever, and the only one i still listen to.  There are only 3 of my metal cds that i bother to play anymore, and this is one of them.  The others are, the scorpions live vol.1, and motley crue shout at the devil.    I put this on about 3 or 4 times a year, year after year. its great to work out to.  but you cant help but weep a little that def leppard wanted to move away from this raw, dirty, energetic little gem.    In fact, if they were to re-record pyromania, and hysteria to match the raw energy of this, id buy them again.    like others have said, every song is a keeper!!
0517543052|5.0|Still have my old copy -- go back to it from time to time -- have watched Ram Dass live his life (had the honor of meeting him once, found him charming and utter without \\"I'm Ram Dass\\") -- and have been inspired by it. That's what this book does best -- inspires you -- if he could do it, so can you. You don't need the drugs --- they may well have been a hindrance to him -- the knowledge he had to go to India for now circles the globe electronically every nanosecond. So -- do you have the guts to give up what he gave up? Let him show you how it's done.....
B000QXDED6|4.0|This telling is unlike any film I'd seen before.  As an artist, I thought it spectacular.  As a woman, well... 8-D    It looks like turning the pages of a comic book (aka: graphic novel) in a good way. Though it's bloody, the color of it is nearly black, giving it an artistic edge.    The stop-action photography is amazing, the choreographed battle scenes are amazing, and Gerard Butler is AMAZING - his best, in my opinion.   Greek mythology has been an interest of mine since grade school, and while I saw the 1960's film which is very good, this version is modern, fresh and very entertaining. I highly recommend it.
0739384198|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE RANDOM HOUSE AUDIO PRODUCT (my review of Stieg Larsson's actual story and writing style will come later)<br /><br />For me this was the easiest of the three sets of CD's to rip to Itunes.  All of the discs are tagged correctly, which was not the case in the last two audiobooks.<br /><br />Again Simon Vance is the reader and again he makes the book an engaging read.  I would not be able to get past all the foreign place names and character names without Vance.  Plus he puts the emphasis right where it needs to be in each narrator sentence and each piece of character dialogue.  There is just one problem with this particular book in the series that was not a problem with the other books. There are a lot of female characters in Nest.  Which is as it should be since one of Larsson's sub themes in the trilogy is an undercurrent of mysogyny in Sweden.  When Vance only had to give major character voices to Salander, Salander's girlfriend Mimi, Blomkvist's editor Erika Berger, Blomkvist's sister Angela Ginnini and one female police detective named Merk (?), he did alright.  He gave each character her own distinctive voice.  This helped me to keep up with each character.  But now there are many more female characters who have a big part in the story and Vance's repertoire of female character voices is getting repetitive, which is making it more difficult for me to keep up.  I don't blame Vance for this.  He is, after all, a man.  He does a great job of giving each of the many male characters a distinctive voice.  I don't necessarily expect a male actor to have as deep a well of female character voices from which to draw.  I think, in the case of this particular book, it would have been a good idea to actually invite a female actress in to voice all the female parts since there are so many of them.<br /><br />THIS IS A REVIEW OF STIEG LARSSON'S STORY<br />I'm impressed that Stieg was able to keep this thriller thrilling even while the heroine spent a good portion of the book confined to a sick bed.  I'm also impressed that the many asides about the newspaper business did not detract from the overall story.  I liked this book a great deal and found it a fulfilling enough end to the series.  I was annoyed by some plot turns Stieg decided to take.  The sideplot of Erika Berger having a stalker gave me no insight into her character or the character of her husband or the Swedish newspaper business.  The side plot seemed to only serve as a way to introduce the character of Lisa (Liza?) from Milton Security as a kind of rogue ex-cop.  Perhaps Stieg intended to use Liza as a continuing character in his decalog but then he dropped dead and the decalog was never completed.  But in this particular book the stalker storyline is superfluous.  I also thought it was just so wholly unoriginal that the woman for whom Mikael thinks he might fall happens to be an amazon goddess who works out three hours a day and came close to being an olympian.  Really Stieg, really?  The most gorgeous female character you've introduced in the series is the one who indescribably falls in love with Mikael and with whom Mikael seriously considers going monogamous?  When Mikael began a sexual relationship with Harriet Vanger I interpreted it as Stieg showing that Harriet herself was free of her past.  The fact that Harriet, a victim of child sexual rape and torture, could have a purely sex-for-pleasure relationship with a man with whom she was not in love and had not built up a history of trust (the way she had with her husband) showed me that Harriet no longer had any inner curses hanging over her head from the things to which her father and brother had subjected her.  She was free and this was shown by her freedom to enjoy sex for pleasure without any neurosis.  So it was about her and not about Mikael so much.  But to have a Constitutional Protection cop with the body of Venus and Serena Williams fall for the admittedly soft Mikael who is also a smoker, well I just couldn't buy it.  I'll give Stieg the benefit of the doubt and assume he intended to exploit the relationship for plot purposes in future books in the decalog.  That would make sense considering she is a cop who spies on other cops and members of the government who might be suspected of breaking the law.  But in this particular story, their relationship annoyed me.  What I did like was the very end where the reader could see Lisbeth progressing as a member of society. The pivotal choice she makes at the end of the book, her visit to Paris, her remembering those for whom she needed to buy Christmas gifts, her acceptance of being in debt to others, I really liked these little touches of her budding sense of her own membership in society.  I imagine Stieg had hoped to develop Lisbeth's since of that membership and the belonging it confers as the decalog progressed.  It's a real shame he was taken from the world of literature at age 50.buy it.

B0015DROBO|3.0|I was very excited to read this book since it was so hyped up by readers. While I enjoyed the plot, the writer put way too much detail into the financial part of it and then just when you think you are about finished with the book, he delves into another story altogether. The female in the book is not a believable character. I found myself skimming through most of this book just to get to the storyline. I will not be reading the other two books.
B000002VJH|4.0|Few bands have as varied a pedigree as the Dead, so following their early-seventies dalliance with country-influenced rock, it shouldn't have been a surprise to find them once again searching for new directions.  This release from 1975 simultaneously shows the Dead at their transcendent best and their self-indulgent worst, but despite some experimental pieces that basically fail, there's still enough great music here to merit a recommendation.  Standouts include the mysterious \\"Help on the Way/Slipknot\\", the exuberant \\"Franklin's Tower\\", and the uniquely energetic \\"King Solomon's Marbles\\", all of which are about as good as anything the Dead ever recorded, with catchy melodies and unusual timings and deliciously intricate guitar hooks.  Then there are the failures: the a-melodic acoustic piece \\"Sage & Spirit\\" and the long, convoluted and sometimes torturous \\"Blues for Allah\\".  Bob Weir's contribution \\"The Music Never Stopped\\" isn't quite a failure, but I can't say I actually enjoyed it, either.  It's hard to endorse a recording that includes such painful fiascos, but the good songs on this one are just too good to miss.  Perhaps a little \\"cherry picking\\" might be in order.
B003JTHETY|2.0|I like the music here but this review refers to the Mission Edition and the \\"extras\\" therein. This is one of the most poorly packaged \\"special\\" editions I've seen in a long while. The extras are online only. The wallpaper is atrocious, pics are few, and band interview footage is of terrible quality and quite short. I paid $4 more for this at Walmart and I can't help but feel ripped off. I think this is a result of the Maiden team just not knowing how to do this right. Hire a third party who know how to do this sort of thing.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|It sounds like the boys from Liverpool recorded these songs for this show in a modern studio.  If you have seen the show but you do not own this album--get it.  If you have this album but have not seen LOVE at the Mirage--go see it!  I could watch the show over and over again (I've seen it twice since Jan 2007).  Every time I want to recall it, I play this EP from beginning to end.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|\\"EHT XOB.\\" If you can't figure out what the two encoded words inside this quote are and feel that they may come from some, say, extraterrestrial tongue, you may find this film to be quite intriguing. Of course, I know what the words are because I encoded them myself! It seems to me that this film employs the same kind of logic contained in the preceding sentences.    I feel this production should come with a disclaimer at the beginning: Contains ideas and images meaningful only to the filmmaker. A couple, portrayed by James Marsden and Cameron Diaz, live in a comfortable home in Richmond. He's involved in research at NASA, and she's a teacher. So far, so good. But it quickly goes bonkers. A box is left on their front doorstep while they are sleeping. Inside the box is another box, which has a large button on top. Soon, a weird guy (wearing a rather dapper hat) shows up and tells the couple that if either pushes the button, they will get a million dollars. (This was back in the early seventies when you could buy something with a million.) Of course, there's a catch. . .    Well, all this occurs in the first few moments, so I haven't spoiled anything. The film does its own spoiling. There are all kinds of bloody noses, zombies in the library, snow that falls without touching anything, giant wind tunnel fans, Vikings on Mars, and a motel swimming pool that doubles as a portal to. . .      I looked up writer/director/producer Richard Kelly in Wikipedia. I watched the film again. All of this did help me to follow and understand the story a lot better. But I still cannot recommend this tangled hodgepodge to anyone. The brightest element was Cameron Diaz's sterling performance.
0553582461|4.0|I was very excited to see that The Tawny Man series was a continuation from the Farseer Trilogy that included Fitz, and greatest of all, the Fool.<br /><br />I don't think this series was as interesting or gripping as the Farseer trilogy, and it didn't seem to me that a whole lot happened for how long it was (at least, compared to the other books), but I thought it was good nonetheless. It kept me interested, which was the main point for me.<br /><br />As for the ending, it was nice that certain relationships got resolved, but one major one was crumbled and left hanging like nothing I've ever seen. I was insulted to read an end like that. And hurt. The protagonist couldn't have been that cool with it, after everything that happened (trying to not give anything away). I could almost not care about the resolved relationship (I got over that one long ago), I just cared about the one the author seemingly made a center of in the book then she ruined it at the end. No happy ending for that relationship.<br /><br />Overall, the books were ok but the ending severely disappointed me.
1601251505|5.0|I picked this up at my local store, having no idea that Paizo was releasing their own RPG. I was hesistant at first and didn't pick it up for a couple weeks. I would open it and page through it some each time I went to the store. Finally the visual treat that this book is won me over and I purchased it. I'm glad I did as it is well worth it's price. Full color and well constructed, it is the way books should be made.<br /><br />It has some much needed changes to 3.5 and gotten rid of some things that were unneccesary. I had grown tired of some things in 3.5 and stopped playing prior to 4.0. My group and I didn't want to play 4.0 when it came out as it doesn't fit our idea of a good set of rules. I had looked at other games but never really played anything else. This plus all the other Pathfinder campaign products has rekindled my desire to play again. I see a Pathfinder campaign in my future because of this book!
1439181780|5.0|I read \\"the secret\\" and I was very taken by the idea. I tried the technique many times and it definitely works when you put your mind to it. The only issue I had with the secret was that it was so hard to continue using the mentality. I would catch myself slipping. With the Power they have simplified it so that it is easy to adapt to your thoughts and your feelings. It put's the idea in another light. It says the same thing but much clearer and stronger and takes it to a new level.  I'm glad I picked this book up. I was in need for a positive fix and this brought me right back up to speed. I read half way through it today and I'm a different person tonight than I was this morning, that's for sure. This is a tiny investment for all of the joy it will bring you. Pick it up.... I highly recommend it.
B002ZG997C|4.0|I knew that it was going to be intense; but it was much more introverted than I thought it would be.  Not as action packed as the other reviews led me to believe, which was fine.  It was just very deep and very dark, even though they completed the mission, to me it wasn't completed.  After all that, I did enjoy it.  Denzel Washington was great in it.
B0000027D5|5.0|4.7 stars<br /><br />[Lotus is from two gigs in Osaka, Japan on July 3 and 4, 1973, btw]<br /><br />I've had the triple Japanese vinyl of this since way back in the day and still consider it one of the best live rock albums of them all, and easily the best package (it's a shame the cd can only hint at the massive majesty of the multiple foldout/mega-poster combo that is this ultimate '70s album cover...covers were a huge part of the mystery back then, and this one conveyed almost as much transcendence as the music). The sound is incredibly detailed on the analog recording, and I must say the transfer to digital, while fair, does not do the original tapes justice; it's rather thin and nowhere near as warm and rich as the analog mix. We get the detail of all that percussion, but not as crisply or with the depth of the vinyl. If ever an album begged for the 5.1 treatment, here it is.<br /><br />But it's still a great listen in any format; this was a key period for Carlos as a player and a seeker. He was about to head into his Devadip phase with McLaughlin, and the insane wall of notes stuff they played live was preceded by this more restrained yet still fully unleashed music. The best part of this stage in Santana's evolution---the intense fire and passion combined with extremely interesting polyrhythms and mostly instrumental workouts---is here in spades, and there are few things on wax from Carlos that match the takes of Neshabur and Toussaint from this gig. Very funky and jazzy while still rocking out hard, with finely filigreed percussion throughout, this is Santana playing for themselves as musicians, not for the radio or the record company (hence this not coming out in America for almost two decades).<br /><br />There are a few of the early hits to assuage those who need such things (performed well if a tad perfunctorily in contrast to the newer numbers), but it's a tribute to Carlos' attitude that he kept his \\"pandering\\" to a minimum and fed the audience what he wanted them to hear, not vice-versa as with most groups. The version of Samba Pa Ti does have some gorgeous spells, and highlight's the band's innate sense of dynamics and Carlos' gentle touch.<br /><br />I hadn't heard Lotus in years but this past week I've been on a wonderful journey through this tour, listening to various concert tapes and watching an old Japanese tv show of the gigs in Tokyo from this same week. [Check out boobtube for plenty of cuts from some of those concerts, and much of the Tokyo show, \\"Santana live Japan 1973\\" will take you to many fine moments.] All of the tour was amazing, but no doubt they caught one of the best nights with the multi-tracks rolling here. The typically super-respectful, mostly silent Japanese crowd highlights the incredible interplay of Shrieve and the percussionists with the double keyboard onslaught, Rauch's tight and funky basslines, and Carlos' ultra-sharp leads. He lays out a lot here, which make his burning solos seem that much hotter. Shrieve and Rauch are monsters and when this whole band is fired up, as on Neshabur and A-1 Funk, it's pure energy.<br /><br />And that's the very best thing about Lotus: its incendiary energy. From moment one the listener is jacked into these guys' world, and Carlos' spiritual quest had him at a very sweet spot right here. You can absolutely bathe in his laser-like focus, and the band keeps up with him every step of the way. Some of the other shows from this tour are looser and more groovy, but they knew the tapes were rolling here and they gave it their all. It electrifies your ears almost all the way through. I've been running in the 105 degree midday heat with Lotus on my walkman this week and barely noticing the sweat pouring off. This music will put you in a perfect trance. It sounds majestic on a good car stereo: you're sitting in the middle of a huge jam, the good kind.<br /><br />If you have any interest in any Santana music, or love electric guitar, great drumming, bass playing, wild percussion, and intense energy in general, Lotus awaits. Plug in and sail away!otus awaits. Plug in and sail away!
B001DF68MA|5.0|I purchased the WeeRide after researching MANY other bike seats/trailers.  I wanted my daughter to be a part of the action, not watching my back side the whole trip.  The WeeRide was the perfect option for us.  We LOVE it and so does she.  I have an Electra Beach Cruiser (Hawaii Custom) and the bar just barely fit, but now that it's installed, we have had no problems.  It's very easy to take the seat off and on and I feel really secure having her in front of me.  My daughter is really tall, so I don't think I will be able to use it much past the age of 2, but it's definitely worth it!  Occasionally she grabs at the handlebars, but I put a basket on the front of the bike, now she tries to get at that instead!  I would highly recommend this for anyone wanting another option to the old standby rear mounted seats or bike trailers.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|After owning this superior album from the first month is was released in America, I played it until the grooves wore out. I never did tire of the title cut 'Bridge Of Sighs' and played drums to it religiously in my basement all year. I was actually already into progressive rock but this album always stayed in my collection as one of the the best of the best blues rock(and even rock)releases of all time. I didn't even love the blues, as all the guitarists I ever knew back in 70's thru 90's were always blues grown. I wanted to meet some Robert Fripp, Allan Holdsworth, Steve Howe, Steve Hackett, and Anthony Phillips inspired guitarists. I digress. Okay, so I bought the CD of Robin Trower 'Bridge of Sighs' shortly after it came out. It was still magical and I relived the passion and outright groove to the heart, that this disc gave me from the initial vinyl purchase back in High School. NOW this remastered and expanded version. WOW!!!!!!  I got a entirely new high on it. As a good music buddy of mine used to exclaim loudly when he heard a record that blew his mind..  THAT's HELL!!!!!!      So here I am with this newly remastered and superbly expanded CD with 8 more tracks on it than the original. WOW!!(again). I have listened to this with Musical Fidelity X-Can V3 headphone amp thru Beyer DT 990 Pro (250 ohm) headphones, and then thru my big system of Moon Equinox SE CD player, Magnum Dynalab 308 Integrated Amp, Triangle Celius 6 way speakers with rear port, all with Cardas interconnects and speaker cable.. etc.  And WHEW!!!  This new edition of the Robin Trower 'Bridge of Sighs' CD is just simply mind blowing, has never sounded better...EVER!!   I am happy to be alive!!  If I had just met a guitarist that sounded anything close to Robin I would have been in heaven playing drums with him. Now I just dream. But dream along with this fantastic CD!!  THIS IS THE ONE!!!! Take a trip with this and see what I mean. You'll never hear music like this again. A++++++++  recommendation for life!
B003JTHESA|5.0|I love this album.<br /><br />I've been an avid Iron Maiden fan since 1983 when I was 15 years old.  This album stands up with the best of them.  Amazing vocals and great song writing.<br /><br />Buy it now.
B0034G4OU4|4.0|Title: Eat, Pray, Love<br />Director: Ryan Murphy<br />Writer: Ryan Murphy, Jennifer Salt<br />Cast: Julia Roberts, Javier Bardem, James Franco, Viola Davis, Richard Jenkins, Billy Crudup, Tuva Novotny<br />Year: 2010<br /><br />A memoir is the exact opposite of a screenplay. A memoir is full of inner monologue, emotion, endless stories that take place over a great amount of time and it's all told in a first person narrative. A screenplay has to be short, concise, pure dialogue and contain very little obvious emotion (thats for the actors to interpret). So when a memoir is chosen to be adapted into a feature film it's quite the challenge. You have to stay true to the events and the person telling them but you also have to work within the constraints that a feature film demands. This is what writer/director Ryan Murphy (Running with Scissors, TV's \\"Glee\\") was faced with on his film Eat, Pray, Love.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert's classic memoir of self discovery, spirituality and love by traveling to Italy, India and Bali is a wonderful book full of wit, wisdom and meaning that can be appreciated by anyone; though only about 2/3s of that is translated to film. In any adaptation, whether it be novel, comic or memoir, there is one thing that I personally want to see faithfully portrayed: the themes (think Marry Harron's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho). Of course there are going to be adjustments to the narrative and characters due to the difference of artistic mediums, but thankfully Murphy pulls it off with his film. He is able to find the right balance of addition and subtraction to properly honor the source material yet also create a satisfying stand alone film.<br /><br />The film beings with Liz (Julia Roberts, Erin Brockovich) struggling with her unfulfilled life and loveless marriage to Stephen (Billy Crudup, Watchmen). Divorce proceeds and so does a rocky rebound relationship with David (James Franco, Milk). Living an aimless life without passion and against the better judgment of her best friend Delia (Viola Davis, Doubt), Liz embarks on a round the world journey to reconnect with pleasure (eat), her spirituality (pray) and self esteem (love). Along the way she meets many 'the wise stranger' (Richard Jenkins, The Visitor; Javier Bardem, No Country for Old Men) and visits some of the most beautiful places on earth.<br /><br />Sure, this may sound like a seriously sappy and contrived film, but in all honesty, it's not. Murphy never lets the film dip into melodrama and handles his story with a smooth, confident hand. While he could have taken some of the more edgier parts of the book (ex: Liz's severe depression) to the screen, the movie ends up being cleaner and crisper and all the more fun without it. The picture is meant to inspire the audience to have fun, to connect and to live life, if the darker issues were included the message could have missed the mark. Murphy accomplishes this sense of euphoria visually and ascetically with the help of master cinematographer Robert Richardson (Inglourious Basterds). The shots of Italy, India, Bali, and heck, even New York, are so georgous that if you can't afford to take a vacation this year, a ticket to Eat, Pray, Love will do the trick.<br /><br />What ties the film together is, of course, the luminous Roberts. She is, of course, a bon a fide movie star and this material is something that she can easily use to showcase her talents. She is backed by a terrific and believable supporting cast of Hollywood stars and native Italians, Indians and Balinese actors- all equally great.<br /><br />Eat, Pray, Love may not be a groundbreaking motion picture, but it's certainly a film that is enjoyable. It engages you emotionally and to me, that is the first and most important thing I look for in any film. It might not be the most faithful adaptation fans of the book were hoping for (and how could it have been?), but on it's own it's a picture with an easy charm and it's a harmless way to spend two and a half hours.<br /><br />Rating: B
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son has loved his Soothies since the day he was born but always had trouble keeping them in his mouth; dropping them and such.  I bought a Soothie Pacifier holder (the honey pot one) but that item failed us.  Soon after I ordered this Wubbanub (my son's first nick name was 'Monkey') at 3 months and even at 6 months old, he LOVES it and uses it as 'security blanket', if you will.  He plays with it and it's very easy for him to hold on to and put in his mouth on his own.  He also gets TONS of compliments on it! It's good to the both of us.  I definitely suggest this product to all mamas!<br /><br />EDIT: My son is now nearly 2 years old. We weened him off this pacifier (THE ONLY ONE HE WOULD USE) at about 12 months by cutting the Soothie out of the Monkey mouth and sewing the mouth shut. He was \\"so over\\" his paci after only 2 nights and now, he and the monkey are inseparable at bed time.
B00003CXRM|5.0|We purchased this movie as a replacement for one we bought when the movie first came out. Somebody \\"borrowed\\" our copy and didn't return it. (When will my husband learn not to lend stuff?????) We love this movie, watch it at least a couple of times a year (and we very seldom watch a movie more than once!)--love the music, the humor, George Clooney in the oddest (for him) and most fun role he has ever played, and his two sidekicks are hoots! All the characters are unique and essential to the story--all played by excellent actors. Every time we watch it we see something new. Also, if you want a movie or a book, Amazon.com is the best! They have always had what I was looking for in stock, at better prices than I can buy it locally, and it gets to me very quickly, even if I don't pay extra to have it shipped extra fast. When I really want something, I go to Amazon.com.
B000RJO578|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I was so excited to get it as soon as it was shipped. Luckily, it was on my doorstep within a few days from when I ordered it. Great service!!! Thank you
B0002EXH5O|3.0|I remember watching these fine chaps on tour (or tur, as my grandaddy used to say) when they were with Stone Temple Pilots back in '93. Surprisingly, STP gave these guys a run for their money, though that could be because Dean Deleo and Junior hit it off so well. Rumor has it that their \\"water cooler\\" chats after the show were the poison of legend.     But back to this record. It's pretty cool, provided you like grunge. What I'm waiting on is the new CCR. (Hey, it was the '70s, man -- everyone was doing stuff!!!!!)     That's my story and I might stick to it!!!!    See ya!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0307388921|5.0|I got the book as a birthday present (thank you guys!) and I loved it. A catchy story in Palahniuk's writing style, and unlike Survivor, the ending is not disappointing. Now I can't help but imagine the scenes of the book when I am flying... if you have read the book, you know what I mean!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|There is no doubt that the dramatization of a Jane Austen novel is immensely popular, perhaps none so much as Austen's `Emma' which revolves around one of the few Austen heroines who is wealthy and doesn't \\"require\\" a husband to maintain her status.<br /><br />The latest adaptation, written by Sandy Welch and broadcast originally as a four-part BBC television drama, is outstanding for it's visual beauty, and production values. Shot on location in the villages and parishes of southern England, you immediately are immersed into a romanticized version of 19th century England. The costumes are beautifully authentic and provide an individualized palette of color for each character that substantiates their personality and status in life.<br /><br />Director Jim O'Hanlon made excellent use of a continuous camera flow that follows the actors through various rooms without missing a line. The casting choices are right on, with no distracting oddities. O'Hanion, working with this excellent cast, obviously put a great deal of emphasis on facial expression and it is a delight to watch great actors convey subtle nuances that enhance the storytelling. Note: Don't pass up watching the Special Features segment provided.
B00005JNEW|5.0|I have to say that I loved this movie. I'm also a huge football fan, but this movie is so much more then just football. Its about a small window in your life called high school. Its about playing the game you love with guys you grew up with. This is big time high school football in Texas. Even if you don't like football, see this movie, if just for the fact the last 15 minutes of this movie will make you stand up and cheer.
0307460444|2.0|The photography is about the best part of the book.  If you're looking for ultra-fancy recipes with somewhat complicated decoration, then this is the cupcake book for you.  I found maybe a handful of recipes I'd like to try.  Most of the recipes yield odd quantities.  Last I checked, most muffin tins are in multiples of 6.  Most of the decorations are WAY too elaborate.  The majority of recipes suggest applying the topping immediately before serving, which won't be practical for most people.  Regret this addition to my cookbook library.
B002RWKSII|4.0|Maybe this was Brian Wilson's return to his roots. Or his love letter to Manhattan through down Doheny Way.<br /><br />The sound he created with his brothers in the Beach Boys nearly a half-century ago rooted in early 50's quartets (Hi-Los, Four Freshmen, Four Preps) with stylish, sharp harmonies bordering on barbershop.  Wrapping those vocals in Chuck Berry rhythms, with Spector-esque symphonic swells and jazzy downward chord changes, created timeless pop music and beatific vision of America: one where it was always summertime and the living was easy. (This is what Katy Perry shouted while snatching a classic Beach Boys song title for her own summer hit.)<br /><br />George Gershwin wrote for stage and screen in an all-too short career. In pieces like \\"Rhapsody In Blue\\" (repeated twice here) he tempered the feel of Strauss waltzes with witty wordplay and jazz he once called in song  \\"this drivel, it's only for nightclubbing souses.\\"<br /><br />\\"Reimagining Gershwin\\" is Brian reaching across 3000 miles and 75 years for common ground. He does so gently, turning \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" into 1950s doo-wop and building the nostalgic, wistful \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" into a polished rhythmic stomp, his unofficial sequel to \\"The Little Girl I Once Knew.\\" Meanwhile, he gives \\"I Got Rhythm\\" a touch of the Happenings' 1966 hit cover while adding musical and rhythmic quotes from \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" and the Rockin' Rebels \\"Wild Weekend.\\"<br /><br />It's a backhanded tribute to Wilson that his least effective covers are also his least re-imagined. \\"I Loves Ya Porgy\\" and \\"S'Wonderful\\" get traditional arrangements (\\"S'Wonderful,\\" a samba, \\"Porgy\\" a humid ballad) and Wilson, despite being in fine voice, seems uncomfortable with their literacy and sensuality (Hearing this legendary boy genius/adult child sing \\"You can't blame me for being amorous\\" is disconcerting, and it's here you miss Carl Wilson's soulful, sensual voice.)<br /><br />But Brian is a pop craftsman who had an eye on his own past as well as Gershwin's, and here \\"I Got Plenty of Nothin'\\" and \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\" become doppelgangers of Pet Sounds' title song and \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder).\\" Two Gershwin melodies Wilson finished (\\"Nothin' But Love\\" and \\"The Like In I Love You\\") become archetypical Wilson compositions: gorgeous, sunny melodies with cloudy lyrics (\\"...Till we found the inner light/then we can duplicate the universe.\\")<br /><br />\\"Re-imagining Gershwin\\" has given Wilson his finest press in years. His last four releases were for four different companies, but aligning with Walt Disney Records assures him the best marketing push his solo work has had.(Plus, no doubt, a standing offer to produce Disney labelmates including three harmonizing Jonas brothers photographed on their last album carrying a surfboard.) Brian Wilson's most renowned work may be behind him, but re-imagining George Gershwin has allowed him a classy way to recall the Great American songbook and his own.

0525423842|4.0|This book is about a Theo, a 13-yr. old likable boy who wants to be either a lawyer or a judge one day.  It was a nice change of pace to read about a good kid from a stable family who makes good decisions and cares about other people.  Both Theo's parents are attorneys who support their son.  Theo is fascinated with the courthouse and is excited when there is a murder trial.  He finds himself in a tough situation and actually turns to his parents for help.  This is not packed with suspense like Grisham's other books.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for boys and anyone who likes reading about trials or is interested in court procedure
0062009540|4.0|Everybody has secrets. Ali has everyone's secrets stored in her pretty little head. When Ali goes missing in the summer between seventh and eighth grade, her friends are devastated. They keep hoping that she'll just show up like nothing happened. While feeling worried, they can't help but feel a breath of relief. After all, she knew all their secrets and if she was dead, their secrets died with her. Three years later, just when they thought they could get past Ali, they start getting mysterious texts from \\"A\\". A seems to know all their dirty laundry and a whole lot more, and A seems itching to air it. These friends who long ago drifted apart, might have to reunite to solve this mystery.<br /><br />Well, I can honestly say I was not expecting that at all. I was expecting snotty, shallow, catty girls being rude and nasty. These were normal girls with a big 'ole mystery to solve. I will be tearing through the rest of this series quite soon. It's addicting. The girls shared this friendship that breaks up soon after the novel begins, with the disappearance of their friend, Ali. Because of how close they were, they have all these inside stories that they reference, but do not reveal what they are about. It was a little confusing at first switching between the different girls' lives, but after you got to know each girls' niche it was much easier to tell them apart. Sometimes it seemed like the characters were a little too normal, a little too not popular. I mean Hannah is popular but she's not super popular, not \\"too good to talk to my old friends\\" popular. If you enjoy a good mystery of LOST proportions, that will probably end better, pick this up. This first book in the series introduces you to a ton of mysteries and does not give away a hint of what might be going on, or what is to come. I recommend this to avid and reluctant readers alike. If you haven't started this series, I suggest you do it soon. I will certainly be Netflixing the T.V. show as soon as it's available. I am interested to see how it will unfold on screen.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"Imagine it's a couple of years ago, the summer between seventh and eighth grade.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Line:<br />\\"They'd watch TiVo'ed episodes of American Chopper, eat pizza delivered from Disilvio's and feel underneath her unsexy sports bra.\\"interested to see how it will unfold on screen.

B002JVWR0Y|5.0|This is just a technical heads up to anyone who has a Sony BDP-S300.  I purchased Dexter: The Fourth Season from Best Buy. Disc One will not play in my Sony BDP-S300.  Disc Two & Disc Three play without issue. When Disc One is inserted into the BDP-S300 I receive the error message: Cannot play this disc. I downloaded and successfully installed the latest firmware update (Version 5.40) but still Disc One is unable to be played. I spoke with Sony's technical support and, despite various troubleshooting, Disc One will not play. I exchanged Dexter: The Fourth Season 3-Disc Blu-ray, at Best Buy, for another and the same issue remains... Disc One cannot be played. I spoke with Sony's technical support again. All they can do is document which title cannot play on a certain model. As this is a very new release, Sony support has to wait and see how many people have the same issue before offering a technical resolution. Just a heads up to anyone who has a Sony BDP-S300. Your Disc One may play fine. My Blu-ray player may be on its last legs, CBS/Paramount's copyright encryption may be newer than Sony's latest update, or I may have received 2 faulty discs (the same title/disc and back-to-back). No one yet knows, but If you encounter the same issue please call Sony support and have them document it.

1553655427|5.0|In direct contention with the pervading assumption that international aid is critical for the survival and eventual growth of the most impoverished countries, Dambisa Moyo contends that aid has actually inhibited these countries from achieving sustainable economic growth. Instead of providing a basic level of sustenance for a country, aid encourages corruption and locks a country into a cycle of debt that prevents viable economic sectors from developing. In this opposition, Moyo recommends a combination of foreign direct investment, intentional and regional trade, bond markets, increasing domestic savings, and reducing the costs of remittances while tailoring these options to the specific circumstances of each country.    Response:    Moyo makes a compelling argument against broad intergovernmental aid. Nevertheless, one of the primary arguments of Jeffrey Sachs, the developer of the Millennium Development Goals and author of The End of Poverty, is that targeted aid to local communities that increases GDP per capita above $300 breaks the poverty trap and allows for economic progress to begin. Until that trap is broken, households cannot amass enough capital for reinvestment, which is critical for economic growth. As Moyo notes, massive flows of aid to any given country do not produce this effect. Rampant corruption, a lack of growth, and rent seeking by public officials become the norm. In short, aid may be able to alleviate poverty and jumpstart an economy but the problem is with the implementation. Unfortunately, there may not be a reliable way to deliver aid to local communities in Sachs' vision on a broad scale. In which case, stopping aid and pursuing other avenues for raising capital as Moyo advocates may still be the best way to spur economic development throughout Africa.    Secondly, Moyo does not discuss the complexities of trade barriers thoroughly enough. There is little question that Western subsidies on agriculture create a severe impediment to growththroughout emerging economies. However, there is a valid geostrategic argument to be made for not removing the subsidies. Without subsidies, most Western countries would most likely import that vast majority of their food products, creating a potential weakness during conflict.    Taking a realist perspective, removing trade subsidies would tilt the balance of power to countries that may violently challenge the Western hegemony, a risk not worth the increased growth in the developing world. There are also counterpoints to the geostrategic argument as well. A neoliberal would likely argue that increased economic prosperity will result in a greater adoption of democratic norms and then use democratic peace theory (democracies seldom fight each other, therefore, if every country is a democracy there should be relatively little war) to argue that concerns for the balance of power are largely irrelevant. Moyo merely acknowledges that there is a geostrategic argument but does not attempt to debase or critique it.    The Bottom Line:    A pivotal book. Moyo strikes an excellent balance between readability and thoroughness, referring to numerous academic studies throughout the book while keeping the writing and content easily accessible. Whether you are involved with development policy or have simply bought the latest (RED) iPod, you need to read this book.    For more reviews and a summary of Moyo's main points, find us at Hand of Reason.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|Excellent movie. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are my top two favorite actor/actress.  This movie has amazing action and a sweet storyline.  I'd definitely recommend this movie anyone!
B001ER4CNY|4.0|I have no complaints whatsoever with the actual DVDs, except for the theme music that absolutely blasts one's eardrums when the menu is accessed. The quality is very clear and sharp and the sound is great for every episode. Unlike many who said in their reviews I found the labelling of each disc just fine and easy to follow. The packaging is  beautiful and eye-catching, although, like others have said, it is poorly designed and is quite flimsy. The accordian style disc holder broke apart the very first time I opened it, but I fixed the problem easily with a tiny bit of glue from a glue gun. I would have prefered that the bottle be made of plastic, but so far I have had no problems with the cardboard bottle and am using it as a decoration in my room. The trivia/episode summary cards and the cute little box they come in are fun and a nice little bonus especially for the collector. I really love the classic I Dream of Jeannie series and overall am pleased with my purchase. The complete box set is something I recommend for all I Dream of Jeannie fans. Enjoy!
B001NFNFNA|5.0|I just reviewed Mr. & Mrs. Smith and had the same great things to say about that movie.  The Changling is based on a true story and really touches your heart.  Angelina Jolie does an amazing job portraying this woman and her times of trial.  This is a must have for those who enjoy movies set \\"back in the day\\" and for any Angelina Jolie fan.
B003OJBWGK|5.0|Fantastic cheery record, with great driving guitar.    This decade's Liz Phair and much more.
B003JTHESA|5.0|I'm going to begin by saying that I, and I know I'll get crap for this, was not an avid fan of A Matter of Life and Death. I felt it was too repetitive and just recycled the same sounds used on Brave New World and Dance of Death. It wasn't a bad album, yet I felt Maiden could do MUCH better. This album, their 15th to be precise, is what the last album should have been. Yes there are more overly long tracks, but you will not find the same recyced melodies and riffs that exist solely on making the songs 10 minutes. They each change structure multiple times throughout the songs, giving them a more intellectual, progressive feel. This album also, unlike the others mentioned, actually sounds closer to Maiden's older material, giving the fans of Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind.. etc. a sound they've rightly missed. This album is GREAT, maybe still not quite a Number of the Beast, but the mere fact that these guys can still produce a quality album the 15th time around in their 60s in outstanding. *APPLAUSE
B001NY42KQ|5.0|This series' climax in HMS 3 was everything the audience expected -- and hoped for. The movie told the story of growing up, facing the future, making tough choices, and sticking to your dreams. Pretty deep stuff for a \\"teen\\" movie musical. The music was irresistable -- like any good musical. The choreography was something special. (How often do you actually enjoy watching men, of any age, prance around, trying to dance?) But this time the choreography seemed to really fit the characters -- Troy Bolton and Chad Danforth -- both very \\"manly\\" characters. But instead of looking foolish, prancing around, they really seemed to be using the choreography as an extension of their dialogue.<br /><br />And, I have to admit that, as a parent, I was wholly impressed by the fact that the writers didn't stoop to the ever-present use (and over use) of sex to make their story interesting. In the end, this was a story about the best in our nation's young people. Just a little bit idealistic, but isn't that what we watch movies for??
B00004TH7Z|3.0|So this is how Maiden will sound at the turn of the century? Cool. I can live with that. This is a pretty decent album with a few really excellent songs. A good album by a great band entering their declining years.
B003NHRIVQ|2.0|The movie was okay, but having read the book it was a million times better. I am not knocking the actors. The book just has more time to fully develop the characters and the story, the movie felt rushed and like it was missing a lot. I barely shed a tear while watching the movie, unlike the rest of the Nicholas Sparks movies, but cried for the last 60 pages of the book and I never cry from books.
B003H6KRIE|3.0|It must be just me but Ive tried to get into these movies and they just dont do it for me. I know people love them but to me they just arent that good.
1878424319|5.0|This book is incredible.  The lessons are non-denominational, and they are laid out in a way just about anyone can understand, based on the simplicity of his teaching style.  I wasn't a huge \\"self-help\\" guy, and this really isn't a self-help book, but it definitely allows you to try a different way of behavior in life that just makes you feel good about everything, from yourself, to your friends and family, to your work.  It is an easy read, and you will feel almost energized after reading it, if you actually try out the suggestions even for one day.<br /><br />It is a great book that I bought twice, and suggested to at least 3 different people by now.
1439181780|5.0|The Power is every bit as good, if not better, than The Secret.  Taken together, they will give you a roadmap to total happiness, health and prosperity . . . Or anything else you may want in life.  Highly recommend this book.
B003JTHESA|5.0|Yes, this album is very different than their previous ones, including A Matter of Life and Death.  It took me about 3 listens to really get into it, since it was very refreshing and progressive.  It really is an amazing album, but it does take time to get used to it.  Maiden yet again prove that they are the most influential heavy metal band of all time.  A dynamic, innovative, and original album.  I mean seriously, who really wants to hear \\"Number of the Beast\\" take 3, or \\"Piece of Mind\\" #2?  These albums have already cemented themselves as instant classics.  It is time to pave a new road ahead.  Simply a work of art.
B001GCUO5M|1.0|Wow, was this movie terrible, from the opening scene of them on the boat (which looked like it was shot in like 1933 or something, with actors filmed in front of a huge projection of a sea) till the last \\"twist\\" ending.  Not scary, not believable, crummy acting.  Blah.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I picked up this headset and the sound from the headphones is fantastic.    However, the microphone wouldn't pick up anything unless I screamed into it.    Honestly, I've heard fantastic reviews of these headsets, and I'm chalking it up to a lemon. I'll be buying another in the future for sure, but I'm returning this headset for a refund.
0316017922|4.0|I think that the book is quite interesting, that it has some insights worth considering. I have not finished the book yet though, so its conclusions and all I can not say if I agree or disagree with yet. I would like to see the resources and other materials of reference for the data though.    So far so good overall, just hope we don't end up with a so called social-justice (aka socialist) conclusion stating that we need more government involvement(infringement)in our lives.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I skipped the premier of \\"Community\\" last fall. The promos didn't make the show seem very interesting. However, I happened to spot it on Hulu a few weeks later and decided to give it a try. Needless to say, I burned through all the back episode in no time and couldn't wait for more. The show is funny, touching and intelligent. \\"Community\\" struggled a bit to find its voice during this first season, but by the time they got to the \\"epic\\" paintball episode, all the pieces were solidly in place.     Don't miss the beginning of this journey! Get the DVD. It's the next best thing to enrolling in Greendale Community College yourself!
0756405890|5.0|This is a story, a tale. The author finds a delicate balance between poetry and simplicity. While the way he uses words are lovely, they are not pretentious, and they are reminiscent of the tales that predate the written word, back when storytelling meant something other than writing.    It is sad and sweet, and a piece of writing that will long be remembered. A lovely book, and recommended to all.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|Terrible acting and directing. This movie was crappy. The next time I see this director involved in any film production my advice will be to do one thing - run far away!!
0307463745|5.0|A friend highly recommended this book so I bought it. I then gave it to one colleague, who gave it to another and so on. Then, a few applicable topics were summarized and sent out to the whole company in an email. This book is so viral it might as well have an Oprah Book Club sticker on the front.    Every topic won't work for every person or organization. But the overall message and fresh perspective on how to (re-)look at the business world is compelling.
0385523386|5.0|I recently moved to Danbury CT from the Bronx and I had no clue that there was a federal prison here in Danbury! I felt a connection with Piper immediately. She did a great job telling  a story of a female who goes through a struggle dealing with \\"the system\\" and does a great job pointing out the ills of the system. Though I have never been in trouble with the law I have compassion for those who are stuck in the system. Like Piper pointed out many times in her book, its hard to break the viscous cycle of leaving jail and coming back because one does not have the resources to survive out in the real world. Hopefully this changes at some point. As for the book  I thought it was great I laughed and cried. I think that anyone who has gone through life struggles can relate with Piper.  All I have to say to Piper is I'm glad you made it and you are very lucky to have Larry and such a supporting family.
0060558121|4.0|I was reluctant to read this book at first, due to the lack of much of a description on the back. I usually like to know the general plot before I dive into a book. Nonetheless, I read it and thought it was quite good. If you like modern fantasy novels, you'll enjoy this book.<br /><br />Quick description (possible spoiler alert): After being released from jail, Shadow meets a man named Mr. Wednesday. Mr. Wednesday contracts Shadow as his assistant and shadow comes to find out that Mr. Wednesday is a god. Mr. Wednesday is leading all the other old gods in America (gods that were brought from other nations when the immigrants came over) in a struggle against the new gods (technology, media, etc.).

B002VPE1XY|4.0|First of all, this is advertised as a camera case.  my sony ericson flip phone barely fits in it.  having said that, it's a nice, attactractive that functions well for what it's designed to do.  is it nice to have? sure. do you really need? probably not.
B002RWKSII|5.0|The Beach Boys were part of the soundscape when I was growing up, but I wasn't a huge fan.  Nevertheless, I was intrigued by the idea of Brian Wilson doing Gershwin, and this CD is an absolute revelation.  How can this 80-year old music sung by a guy who was popular 50 years ago sound so fresh?  Well, it does, and it made me smile through the whole CD.  It made me feel nostalgic and happy.  Every song is good or great.  My favorites are I Got Rhythm and They Can't Take That Away From Me.  There is, of course, a Beach Boys vibe underlying many of the arrangments, but BW also goes it alone to great effect (I Loves You Porgy).  His love and respect for the music shines through.  He is doing a great service by reintroducing (or \\"reimagining\\") it for today. I also think it is very cool that BW got to complete and perform a couple of Gershwin song fragments.  This may very well be the CD of the year for me.  What a wonderful treat as summer is winding down.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food, Inc. will change the way you think about food and where it comes from. This documentary on the food industry delves into the business behind food production and the dark side of farming.<br /><br />A few multi-national companies control the vast amount of food production and dictate how farmers and growers run their operations. Though the documentary interviews individual farmers and workers, the huge corporations all seemed to decline to be interviewed.<br /><br />The documentary shows chicken growing productions where enormous chicken houses without access to light are a primary method for producing chickens. The conditions inside the chicken houses are disgusting and chickens are packed together with little room to move. They are fed hormones and antibiotics which reduce the chick to adult gestation period from 70 to 49 days. This growth is so rapid that the internal organs and body structure are not equipped to support the chicken.<br /><br />The documentary also shows enormous feed lot cattle productions where cattle are fed corn though the natural food is grass for cows. The cows stand in large amounts of their own manure which makes it much easier to spread Ecoli to the cows and sometimes ends up in the final product.<br /><br />Workers at a pork processing plant in North Carolina are interviewed to discuss the poor working conditions and what seems to be uncaring nature of the company towards it's workers. The conditions for the animals when they are growing are poor as well. They are  confined to a small cage rather than free to roam. It seems to be a mass production factory rather than an operation with good quality control and safety measures.<br /><br />Large fast food operations such as McDonalds want virtually identical products every time and this has resulted in cookie cutter production of food instead of the production of cows, chickens, and pigs. Their high demand for identical factory animals has pushed the concepts of mass production feed lots and encourages unsanitary conditions through cost cutting.<br /><br />There are now patent laws protecting specific strains of seeds which some companies have used to wield virtual monopoly power over farmers. One example mentioned in the documentary is the company Monsanto who controls 90% of all soybean production and forbids farmers from saving seed forcing them to continue purchasing seed from the company. The company resorts to strong arm tactics and regularly sues farmers and seed cleaners to further secure their monopoly under the auspices of protecting their soybean patent.<br /><br />The government officials responsible for regulating the food industry often have direct ties back to the major companies so there would appear to be a strong conflict of interest in enforcing regulations.<br /><br />A law called Kevin's law, named after a 2 year old who died following eating hamburger infected with Ecoli, has not become law yet but has had various versions proposed over the past 5 years. If passed this would give the USDA the ability to more closely regulate the meat and poultry industry to reduce pathogens in meat production and potentially shut down plants that breach health regulations. Feel free to contact your congress members to let them know of this proposed law.<br /><br />As an alternative to mass production, examples of organic farming are presented. The animals are able to interact with each other and walk around freely similar to how they might in the wild. They eat natural foods rather than being force fed corn. A very articulate and humorous farmer name Joel Salatin, owner of Polyface Farms in Virginia, has fully embraced this style of farming and runs a very successful operation. He talks about letting chickens be chickens and allowing the pigness of pigs. Though organic food costs a bit more, proponents say it taste better and is better for the eaters health. Large corporations such as Walmart and Target have begun selling organic food and this will help with economies of scale and cost reduction.<br /><br />Throughout the documentary I found myself going \\"woah, your kidding right?\\" I won't say that I'll never eat fast food again or purchase non-organic but it definitely gives pause towards thinking about where the things you're eating come from. I definitely recommend this 90 minute video to everyone wanting a behind the scenes look at the food industry.the documentary I found myself going \\"woah, your kidding right?\\" I won't say that I'll never eat fast food again or purchase non-organic but it definitely gives pause towards thinking about where the things you're eating come from.

B000TR1D1O|5.0|I absolutely love this album. This is the second time I'm buying it because I wore the CD out (actually, I lost it, but hey, it probably would've worn out soon anyways, right?) Typically classified as pop or broadway, it is definitely more along the lines of swing, or a genre of my own creating, 50s Italian. Listening to it makes me think of movies such as Bronx Tale, Goodfellas, and the like. If your a Sinatra fan, you will definitely love Louis Prima.     I never get tired of listening to this, and if you decide to purchase it I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
159562015X|3.0|The 2.0 in Web 2.0 is more synonymous with \\"ease of sharing\\" than it is with \\"improved\\".  Unfortunately, ease of sharing is the main drawback of Tom Rath's Strengths Finder 2.0, a powerful personal discovery tool that is hindered by the lack of a desperately needed social element.    The Good: In-depth analysis of personal strengths  Rath strives to equip readers with a detailed analysis of their strengths and how to maximize them. The results are incredibly deep and thorough and readers won't be disappointed with the analysis, even though other free inventories provide similar results. The first 40 pages of the book explain the importance of understanding and maximizing individual strengths rather than discovering and improving weaknesses. Rath justifies this with a simple formula.    Talent * Investment = Strength    Rath imagines that a person has a score of 1-5 in the areas of Talent and Investment. He says that a person with a lot of talent (5) but little investment in those talents (2) receives the same 10 score as a person with not much talent (2) but a lot of investment (5). Neither of these stories, according to Rath, are examples of a good way to maximize strengths. On the other hand, Rath argues that people should focus on the talents they score a perfect 5 on and work to invest as much as they can. Hence, Rudy scores a 10 in football and Joe Montana scores a perfect 25. We find a lot of inspiration in Rudy's story, but his extensive investment in football was probably a waste of time. If he would have invested more of himself in an area of natural talent, he could have had a bigger impact and a more satisfying life.    After using an access code sealed in the back of the book to unlock a 35-minute inventory, readers receive a deep examination of their top five strengths out of 35 possible areas. If a reader wants to get a further analysis or find out how they ranked on all 35 areas, they must pay $550 for a personal consultation.    I cannot imagine the$550 being a wise investment for anyone or any group, and it makes the book and inventory seem like hook instead of a stand-alone tool. However, reading the results is enjoyable and satisfying. There's much to be gained and the  results seem personalized and accurate. At it's core, Strengths Finder 2.0 is really a book about you and finding simple ways to make yourself more happy at home and work. Rath succeeds at this in a number of ways and makes the book quite a satisfying personal reflective experience.    The Bad: 2.0 should mean sharing.  While the book and the Strengths Finder test that comes with it are insightful and based on over a decade of research on 10 million people by Gallop, the access code that comes from the book only allows one person to take the test one time. The results are made to be shared with others, but learning about someone else is not as interesting when others can't take the test as well. Very few people in my life are fascinating enough for me to invest 30 minutes of reading about them without wanting to see how I compare to their results. My first reaction upon taking the test was to see how my wife would score; however, if I wanted to see her results, I'd have to buy another $25 copy of the book. Since I didn't want to invest that, I decided not to even mention the results to her. I understand that the test is the book's big hook, but it leaves the feeling of taking the test a little empty when results can't be shared without a caveat. This was the same weakness of the online test included with The Survivor's Club. The impact of books like these (as well as the sales numbers) would be increased if the tests allowed one or two extra people to share in the results.    Over 3/4 of the book is analysis of the different strength types, so without the ability to share results easily with those who are close to you, the book is pretty empty.    Application  This book is a good choice for a Professional Learning Committee or a small professional group to use as a discussion starter. I am fortunate enough to be using it in this way with a small group of colleagues. My boss is using this as a way to begin a discussion with a group of us in order for us to make work a more supportive, enjoyable place. This type of sharing of results is essential and appreciated. It makes the experience of the book more complete and the majority of the book seems useful this way. If the group of us are supportive of each other's strengths - while keeping in mind that we aren't defining ourselves as only proficient in five areas - it could lead to a better workplace environment, more motivation, and more happiness.    On the other hand, although the results of the inventory are intended to be deep, there could be  a risk of pigeonholing people as one dimensional. For example, when looking at my results, I was a little disappointed to see that - although they resonated with me - they felt quite similar to each other. I apparently like learning new things and want to always learn more, I like ideas, I'm good at expressing my ideas with big words, I use knowledge to find patterns, and I value all people. This doesn't seem like an especially rich portrait of myself - so I would worry that co-workers would disregard how much I like making things happen and actually applying what I learn. I don't want my potential for leadership discounted by five strengths. Any group using this book should use it as a way to foster stronger awareness of the differences and strengths of everyone in an environment without discounting things that are not specifically mentioned in the top five formula.    Other personality inventories could be equally valid and should be used in conjunction with this tool in a PLC environment to continue the spirit of learning about others and appreciating differences.
B0034JKZ86|2.0|Disney finally decides to do a princess movie where the lead character is a black female, but they purposefully choose a story where the character spends as little time as possible being black on screen. I timed it. She spent about 20 minutes of the movie as a black girl and the rest of the time she was a green frog.     Typical. I expected nothing less from Disney.
B002RWKSII|5.0|You know the phrase, \\"They don't make them like that any more\\"? Well, Brian Wilson STILL CAN, STILL DOES, and DID. The Gershwins and Brian Wilson are already towering giants of popular songwriting and quintessential Americana; together, it turns out, they are dumbfoundingly GREAT too. There's bountiful heart, soul, and sonic elegance/richness on this album, and it all just WORKS AMAZINGLY WELL. Everything you love about the Gershwins, Brian Wilson, and the Beach Boys' sound, which his singular ear created, is on this album. As other reviewers have pointed out, Brian and co-writer/lyricist Scott Bennett have masterfully completed two Gershwin song fragments left by George and Ira, in addition to covering ten of the Gershwins' most beloved tunes. Brian's own vocal nod to George--the slow theme from \\"Rhapsody In Blue,\\" done as a wordless chorus of Brians singing in lush harmony--ushers the listener in/out of the album at either end. Every track is a gem; each arrangement is a labor of love and calculated, magical perfection; and the whole leaves you feeling as though you've been to Wilson-Gershwin HEAVEN for 39 almost 'timeless' minutes. Brian's vocals are among his best solo work yet, and his band is TIGHT, spot-on, and spirited. And I dare anyone to try to NOT tap a foot during \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me!\\" Amid all the turmoil in our world right now, this is the best dose of entertainment mega-joy that I know of for the money. Do yourself a favor and grab up this album fast, and DON'T wait for the holidays to share it with family and friends.

0375842209|5.0|Gorgeously written and cleverly narrrated, The Book Thief sets the reader down on a street in Nazi Germany, a village named Molching near the city of Munich. We experience Nazi Germany through the eyes of Death, the narrator of the book, and a young girl named Liesel Meminger, who arrives unwillingly at the door of a house on Himmel (Heaven) Street of reasons she is not quite sure of. We know that she has lost a father, that her mother is unable to care for her, and that her six year-old brother dies on a train before they were able to reach her new foster parents on Himmel Street.    While beautifully written and mesmerizing, reading the Book Thief is like sitting down with an ADHD-challenged friend and listening to him (Death seems masculine here, for some reason), tell you a story.  Unable to help himself, Death jumps around, blows endings, and gets distracted by his own prose quite easily. Death takes the reader through Nazi Germany and shows us the humanity that is left in spite of the inhumanity that we are already so familiar with.  Here's an often overlooked fact: not all Germans in Nazi Germany were Nazis.    We follow Liesel's childhood.  What could have turned out to be an incredibly painful childhood with the disappearance of her parents and the death of her six-year old brother during a major world war turns out to be a fairly happy existence employed as a well-respected player in the ever present street soccer games and an occasional thief of books and food.  Though seemingly perpetually hungry, Liesel grows to love her foster parents, even her foul-mouthed foster mother who occasionally beats her with a wooden spoon and calls her (and everyone else) \\"saukerl\\" or \\"saumensch.\\"  Pig.  Pigman.  Her barely educated foster father teaches her how to read (Liesel is nine when we meet her), and rescues her from the almost constant nightmares she experiences about the death of her brother.  Liesel steals her first book, \\"The Gravedigger's Manual,\\" from a hapless apprentice gravedigger who buries her brother, and it is this book that her foster father reads to her every night and eventually uses to teach her how to read.  Books (for poor people anyway) are difficult to come by in Nazi Germany.    Markus hauntingly captures the fear and depression of the German people during the bombings of their cities and villages.  Death, ever present, collects their stories (sometime literally as in Liesel's case), and  tells them wistfully to the reader.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|Ozzy's newest CD is another great album from the Ozzman and the first without Zakk Wylde. Gus G. is a damn good guitarist, even though most of the parts were already written my Churko. This album surpasses Black Rain, but isn't near classic status yet, while several tracks like \\"Let Me Hear You Scream\\", \\"Life Won't Wait\\", and \\"Diggin' Me Down\\" will be songs that the Ozzman should keep playing live. Complaint? The solos need more life in them. I felt that, with Black Rain, they were too short and didn't really exceed on being amazing. Still, if Ozzy does another record, he needs to get rid of Kevin Churko. Overall, damn good album.
0393072231|5.0|A jargon filled book, making it rather thick for a person who isn't fluent in this--but if you read the last chapter first, THEN the book (and once again the last chapter) the anger will carry you through. Like skiing, slide over the jargon. It doesn't really matter. Is like the Wizard of Oz--set up to obfuscate what they were and ARE doing to us and our financial market. Scamming us all--to make money they didn't earn.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|I purchased this for a friends birthday and watched it with him and it was outstanding!!! He is a HUGE Beegees fan and I like the Beegees to a certain degree and we both agreed that this concert was GREAT !!! They sounded amazing,just like the original recordings.Very talented guys and worth watching !
0439023483|5.0|A very interesting read! Kept me guessing the whole way through the book. There are a lot of twists and turns...keeps you wanting more! I cannot wait to read the next book. Very easy reading, and holds your attention.  This is written as though it is for young adults...however I would not let me child or teenager read this book. Keep in mind the whole idea of the book is a bunch of teenagers \\"fighting to the death\\". As an adult I loved this book! I however would not let a child under 16 read it.
B001AQMBKA|2.0|Lost is great. I have seen every episode and love watching it all again. BUT, I hate the bluray disc. Disc one has 15 minutes of ads that cannot be ff. If you only watch one episode at a time you have to go thru each time. Getting to the menu is a problem and you have to remember which ep you saw last. There is no list for all the episodes included in the jacket. Season Play does not work at all. Now that I know that I can watch from Netflix this will be my last Blu ray TV program.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|A worthy addition to the already spectacular Ray LaMontagne library, \\"God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise\\" does not disappoint!
0545123275|3.0|I mostly enjoy books with a supernatural theme to them, so I thought Shiver would be a perfect book to purchase.    While I enjoyed the idea of Shiver, it's delivery was a little slow. It doesn't fall into the category of books I just couldn't put down, couldn't wait to know what happens next. There really isn't a huge climax in the book, just smooth sailing. I liked the 2 person perspective, I think that added alot to the story, and I liked it enough to order the sequel, Linger. All in all, it's a good read... something to fill the void while waiting for a new book to be released.
0143118420|5.0|first i have to say, i get amused by reviews that state how they find the book to be amazingly self centered and silly because... it's not a biography about someone else's life. it's the author's take on her experiences in her own words. what else would you expect?     sometimes in life, i think, it is nice to know that someone in the world exists who has shared an experience or feeling that you have experienced yourself. even if that person is someone who you never actually meet. the knowledge of their existence can be a comfort in itself.     and the fact that this book has turned into such a phenomenon is a testament that millions of people have been able to relate to ms. gilbert's feelings and perspectives.     for me, after reading the sample on kindle, i honestly decided i had to keep reading because i have never before encountered someone who thought as much and almost as crazily and i do every day of my life and relished the chance to understand someone else's perspective on what it means to find yourself and learn to live and thrive in this world.     for that reason alone - to me, this book is worth reading. probably more relateable for women. but i don't see why men can't enjoy it as well :). and no, this book isn't for anyone.    but if you have ever spent hours wondering the whys. you might enjoy a lighthearted sincere perspective of someone who spent a year devoted to pondering those whys.
0439023483|5.0|I was a little leary about ordering this book, but I was in for a surprise! I love books that have a surpernatural sci-fi setting and I was worried this book might focus too much on the postapocalyptic world idea. Suzanne Collins manages to create a world of destruction without obsessing over its details. She lets the charectors and their relationships become the dominant focus.    She has created a heroin who is not some damsil in distress but one who can hold her own. This is both refreshing and empowering. There are no superpowers here, just a girl who can take care of herself and her family with her own two hands. She has a strong, protective relationship with her little sister, Prim, who anyone can relate too. A father who died tragically, leaving a mother who has failed to take care of her children. A best friend who might be more important than what she expected him to be, and a boy who she never saw coming. With a little complicated romance thrown in, what more could a girl ask for?     I finished this book in 24 hours, Katniss' story is both powerful and heartbreaking. While participating in The Hunger Games you learn how far she will go to save herself and the people she loves. Collins leaves you questioning how far you would go.
B00000JLWW|1.0|People raved about this movie. And said they went to the movies to see it twice. I wouldn't won't too see it twice. Once was enough and the movie was BAD! I just didn't get what was all the hype about. A turkey of a movie.
0545123283|3.0|In this sequel to Shiver, Maggie Stiefvater continues Grace and Sam's story. Sam is human again, and Grace is left questioning just how human she is.<br /><br />Linger is told through 4 different charectors (Grace, Sam, Isabel and Cole). I like seeing this book through other participants in the story besides Grace and Sam, it's a rare chance that you get to step into so many charector's shoes. Although, at some points it's hard to adjust to bouncing around to different personalities and their emotions.<br /><br />I think it's because I'm naturally curious and just HAVE to finish a book to know the ending, but reading Linger I can definetly see how it's tempting to just put the book down and pick up something else. Maggie Stiefvater writes beautifully, there are times I have stopped and re-read paragraphs or sentences because they sound like elegant poetry. This gets in the way of the progress of the story though. I felt like she spent too much time debating the story and not enough time to make it happen.  I think that if you fell in the love with Grace and Sam's love in Shiver than you will appreciate Linger.
0307266303|5.0|I was surprised by the quick response and service in getting this product to me. Within days of ordering my book was already showing up on my doorstep. Additionally, the product was in great condition.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|I wasn't expect much when I walked in to the theater, but after the show, I can't wait for The Expendables 2.  This movie has lots of action, martial arts fighting, shooting and suspense.  Also it got a great cast and I like the good ending.  I'm going to invite some friends and watch it again.  Highly recommended if you like no nonsense action movie, but don't expect too much plot or story.
B000092T6M|5.0|I truly place this movie in my Top 10 all-time movies. I refuse to see the new version. I love the special edition and I'm glad I saved money with Amazon.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|This is an awesome package!  My kids & I decided to a Led Zeppelin theme for my hubby's 58th birthday gifts. The kids got him a t-shirt and a photo/bio book and I got him the CD/DVD Mothership. The CD's have the cream of the crop Zepplelin songs and the DVD of live concert songs makes me wish it was 1969 again.  A definite must-have for die-hard Zep fans.
1400052173|5.0|There is sufficient dialogue and detail in this writing to make it seem like a historical novel in the same vein as \\"In Cold Blood\\". I'm sure than some people will pan it as being maudlin, pandering, and exceedingly romantic, but if you want to know anything about Henrietta Lacks, you aren't likely to find it anywhere else. I'm glad the book was written, that she now has a proper headstone, and that people have dropped the waspy Helen Lane and Helen Larson that I heard so many times during college in the 1970's.
B000FVQLQQ|3.0|This is a typical Hollywood \\"based on real life\\" movie: some of the names are those of people who actually lived, but that's about as close to accuracy as it gets. The movie is a romantic gloss, a superficial ice-skate over a complex and painful story. In real life, Nash tried to escape from the USA, traveling around Europe and trying to renounce his US citizenship until the American government leaned on the French to have the poor man deported back to the States.  Likewise the \\"treatments\\" Nash undergoes in the movie bear no resemblance to what happened to him in reality.  And, of course, whereas in the movie his wife stays by his side through thick and thin, in real life she divorced him and left him to his fate.<br /><br />So, if you want to watch a standard Hollywood schlock romance flick with a bit of fake mental-health stuff thrown in, this is the movie for you. But if you want to understand Nash and his affliction, this reasonably well-acted piece is a total distortion and therefore a waste of time.

I think that if a corporation is going to go through a change, at least for me, just tell me what you're doing, why you're doing it, and if I can get on board with it, fine, and if not, then that's my problem.    Keep it simple.  End of story.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I loved this movie. It was pretty funny, and kept my attention throughout. It was, however, possibly one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. I don't want to spoil anything, but seeing an 11 year old girl do/say what Chloë Grace Moretz does in this movie was unnerving, but it really helped set the dark tone. I'd recommend this to anyone over the age of 17. Some people have have said they thought it was a kids' movie. God forbid any child would see this lol.

Quite simply, it's the best book on the pursuit of passion and purpose driven entrepreneurship that I've ever read. If you're looking to make a difference in the world and/or if you want to become successful in you're own business, Delivering Happiness is required reading.<br /><br />Each of us can only do so much. We must start by actively living the values we want to see in the world. Our jobs are our livelihood and, as places of high interaction, they provide many opportunities to better the world by becoming a better person. Ultimately, commerce enables us to care, in a hierarchal needs sense, and it provides a structure for each of us to pursue happiness in our work, which is an offering to satisfy someone else's need. The diversity of our interests creates dependency on each other and encourages greater participation in the system. It allows us to succeed on merit and for us to win in our own way.

1593081030|5.0|While there is no objective, universally binding standard for what constitutes truly great literature, one central element I think almost everyone can agree with is that of \\"universality:\\" that is, great literature comments profoundly on the human condition, so that, despite being temporally bound (The Mayor Casterbridge, for instance, is set during the early nineteenth century in the quasi-fictional region of England known as Wessex), it can comment on all people in all ages. Now, there are certainly some aspects of the setting that will be utterly alien to the contemporary reader, but Hardy was famously modern, not only in his choice of themes, but also in his understanding of his characters' emotional lives. Hardy is second only to Dostoevsky in being the greatest psychological novelist of the nineteenth century. Arguably his greatest character portrait is of Michael Henchard, the protagonist of The Mayor of Casterbridge. Henchard's strong personality can almost be described as immanent, pervading and influencing every aspect of the novel, whether he is on-screen or not. He is the personification of that phrase \\"force of nature.\\"<br /><br />The novel follows the exploits of Henchard, from his days as a poor hay-trusser, where, in a powerful first chapter, he sells his wife and infant daughter, in a drunken rage, to a sailor at a county fair, to his subsequent swearing off of alcohol and his rise to prominence as Mayor in the town of Casterbridge, and then through the myriad circumstances which lead to his ultimate down-fall.<br /><br />Immediately, there are some differences between this work and Hardy's later tragedies which, I feel, elevates this work above those others. First, and perhaps foremost, is that Michael Henchard participates in, and perhaps is the primary cause of, his own fall from grace. He is not a passive victim crushed in the gears of an uncaring universe, as are Jude Fawley and Tess Durbeyfield of his other major tragedies. Henchard influences his fate to a great degree, and, due to his \\"volcanic\\" inclinations, is the only one who can be blamed for his life turning out the way it did. The motif here is described in the introduction to this novel (which I strongly urge you not to read before the primary text) as \\"character as fate,\\" and that perfectly describes the course of this novel, where Henchard can only be said to be a victim of his character and the effects wrought by it on his life.<br /><br />There is also the atypical nature of the structure of the novel. This is not a tragedy where structure crushes character. Henchard almost seems to battle against the trappings of narrative itself, refusing to submit to a smooth incline and then decline, but rather constantly struggling, and failing, to either redeem himself or improve his station in life, his path obstructed by obstacles of his own making. Anger, lies, and pride suffice to entrap him in circumstances that ultimately crush his will to live. But he doesn't go down without a fight.<br /><br />What makes this novel work is that, despite all of his sins and character flaws, Michael Henchard is a fundamentally decent man who we can identify with. And here lies the universal aspect of the novel. While the melodrama and coincidence that serve as plot fodder for Henchard to deal with might be alien to the lives of real readers, Hardy's incisive analysis of how a furious temper, personal pride, and a tendency toward alcoholism can utterly devastate a person's life certainly isn't. How many potential Henchards have you met in your life? How much of Henchard can you see in yourself? Because Hardy modeled much of Henchard's personality after his own, and because of Hardy's utter self-honesty, we have here an extremely emotionally realistic protagonist.<br /><br />There are several other aspects of Hardy's novel that are praiseworthy. As a poet, Hardy was a master with words, and he paints scenes of excruciating pain and tender beauty like an expert. Thenovel can be languid, tense (with Casterbridge feeling almost claustrophobic at times), moving, somber, irreverent, and intense, all in turns. There are also potential flaws. Henchard's personality does tend to outshine everyone else's, although I do think that what some call the poor characterization of other characters in the novel (Elizabeth-Jane and Donald Farfrae being the primary targets of this criticism) is merely Henchard's somewhat unreliable observations of other character leaking out into the novel's supposedly \\"objective\\" third person POV.<br /><br />The work IS admittedly quite often melancholy, and skirts depressing this reader very closely at times. Life isn't all joy and happiness, though, and Hardy is a fine guide through the darker avenues of human existence, without ever being entirely morbid in his outlook (there is comedy throughout The Mayor of Casterbridge, which helps to keep the tone of the novel somewhat balanced). This is a book everyone should read at least once.erbridge feeling almost claustrophobic at times), moving, somber, irreverent, and intense, all in turns. There are also potential flaws.

B000EXZDOQ|5.0|`Ready an' Willing' should be seen as the peak of the first era of Whitesnake as it is their finest collection songs and would be seen as their most accomplished album until maybe `Slide It In' released three years later.  Ian Paice rejoined his former Purple mates Coverdale and Lord and completed `Snake's best lineup (arguably) and this lineup would last for a for a few years until Whitesnake the band succumbed to their leader's whims to become another Rainbow as far as musical chairs are concerned. `RnW' contains many great examples of the classic Whitesnake sound, as they were originally conceived - a hard driving blues rock band (before the age of hair metal). For those who prefer the later platinum selling Whitesnake, there is a perfect point of comparison as `RnW''s first song and single \\"Fool for Your  Loving\\" was later remade nine years later as a pop metal/MTV extravaganza. You can guess which version I prefer and can maybe understand why when the '89 redux came out I wanted to throw up in my mouth! Other great songs on the LP include \\"Sweet Talker\\" and the title track which makes for a killer first three songs on any album. \\"Ain't Gonna Cry No More\\" is sort of the album's sleeper track as it builds from ballad to rocker fluently and \\"Blindman\\" is a classic Coverdale ballad (that original came from his first solo record). Much like the previous Whitesnake efforts there is a ton of blues here which while gaining popularity in the UK and the Continent did not make much of a mark in the US and that was probably the biggest reason the Coverdale would change the band by mid decade and make it more palatable to the glam metal market. Commercially he was absolutely correct but for fans of the original band, at what cost? If you are a fan of hard blues rock in the Free/Bad Company tradition then you will love `RnW'....be my friend be my brother...
B00006RY6W|3.0|I have a nice, rather high end sound system, complete with the 5.1 surround set of speakers, all that.  I got the set up a couple of years ago after returning from Iraq.  I have bought up just about all the multi-channel SACD's that I have even a passing interest in, including DVD Audio discs.  A good thing, too, because discs that I spent 17 dollars and some change in 2008 now go for exorbitant prices.    About all that is left for me to buy in the way of Classic Rock are Genesis, Kinks and Elton John offerings.  I detest all three of those groups, but will probably hold my nose and buy a few.    I have also started buying stereo SACD discs, and usually am very satisfied with the sound.  So, it was time to buy up the Creedence SACD's.  I got the Cosmo's Factory disc a while ago, and it is first rate, booming sound, every nuance available to be heard, even though it is stereo.    So, I put Willie into the slot and sat back to listen to it, in great anticipation.  I do like Creedence, and like them a lot.  I hadn't heard Willie in a few years, so I was looking forward to the experience.    A bassy muddy mess, with no high end to speak of was what greeted me. Very disappointed with the SACD sound.  Haven't listened to the regular stereo yet, but I hope you can actually hear the cymbals in a form other than a thuddy whump.    The album is a Classic, 5 stars.  The sound quality, for an SACD, is one star.
0061777250|1.0|\\"Consciousness Beyond Life\\" is an attractive and well produced book. The translation from the original Dutch is fluent and professional. A systematic analysis of each of the chapters reveals it to be an unusual book, because it accommodates two levels of readers within one book. It accommodates readers with a minimal knowledge of the functioning of the human body and only a high school education, as well as readers with a good college or university education.<br /><br />For example, Chapter 1 is simply a woman's eloquent personal description of the personal and emotional consequences of a near death experience (NDE). Nothing else. No analysis, and no comment.  Chapter 10 is sandwiched, seemingly at random between several difficult technical chapters. This is another extensive personal and emotional NDE account by an equally well-spoken and eloquent woman. Again, no comment, and no analysis. Just an account of her experiences and emotions. This is a curious juxtaposition of extensive personal testimony between technical chapters explaining the nature and classification of NDEs by an expert with scientific credentials. Such a juxtaposition is common in scripts for popular television talk shows, such as that of Oprah Winfrey, but in a \\"scientific\\" text? These chapters seem to be intended as filling for the uncritical believer.<br /><br />Chapters 2 to 6 differ in no way from the content and depth of discussion you can read in all popular NDE books written since 1975. These chapters provide absolutely no new insights or information advancing the study of NDEs. Standard NDE stories are cited, including that of the \\"man with the dentures\\". This last is called veridical, supposedly proving the reality of a separate consciousness. But examination of the evidence upon which this story is based proves something very different. The same is true of all other NDE stories in these, and other chapters. The analysis of causes of the NDE is also as superficial, and unenlightening as in books of 20-35 years earlier. No new insights to be found in these chapters. However, they are written in an easily read popular style which will certainly be appreciated by many readers.<br /><br />Chapter 7 is a good exposition of the outstanding NDE study of cardiac arrest patients performed by  van Lommel and his co-workers in the Netherlands. The best chapter in this book.<br /><br />Chapter 8 is a reasonably technical explanation of the results of the study described in Chapter 7, but the author appears incapable of relating the consequences of cardiac arrest with changes in brain function. His final conclusion is that the NDEs reported by 18% of patients in this NDE study can only be explained by something unknown and paranormal. Curious, when you consider the results of this otherwise excellent study are readily explained by insights from neurological science known for at least 50 years before the first publication of this book in The Netherlands during 2007. This is where this book begins to fall apart.<br /><br />Chapters 9, and 11 to 16 are a more or less difficult explanation of brain function, consciousness, and their relation to the wonders of quantum physics. Wonders such as biophotons, non-locality, quantum entanglement, etc, are all invoked to finally produce a theoretical construct \\"proving\\" the  author's belief in the separability of the consciousness from the body, as well as survival of consciousness after death. The arguments and seeming lack of understanding of basic physiology, neurology, and simple quantum physics would be laughable, were this book not regarded so seriously by many people. It would require a book double the size of \\"Consciousness Beyond Life\\" to explain the incorrect, tendentious and suggestive nature of his conclusions and explanations. These chapters are pseudoscience presented in a form made believable to the uncritical or the uneducated.<br /><br />The most appalling part of the book is the last. Pim van Lommel doubts the reality of the diagnosis of brain-death. He ignores the reality of medical science as proven time and again since 1977, the year the first international guidelines for diagnosis of brain-death were published. In doing so, he sows doubts among potential organ donors, as well as the families of those who have already made heartrending decisions regarding organ donation of brain-dead relatives. These opinions are the baseless personal opinions of Pim van Lommel alone, and have no basis in medical fact. They are suggestive and misleading. I wonder whether those who believe such suggestive nonsense would refuse to accept a kidney, heart, or liver transplant? Potential organ donors should educate themselves and learn the true facts about brain-death.<br /><br />In conclusion, just as the recent book by Jeffrey Long called \\"Evidence of the Afterlife\\", this book contributes absolutely nothing new to the study of the fascinating NDE phenomenon. The book reveals a deficient understanding of critical analysis, basic physiology, neurological literature, and quantum physics. Nonetheless, the author combines all this into a magical and wondrous hodgepodge which will certainly be valued by uncritical believers  in the supernatural reality of the NDE phenomenon. I would not recommend this book to a critical reader except as another good example of bad science.s the reality of the diagnosis of brain-death.

0375842209|3.0|If you sat down to create the personification of death, what characteristics would you attribute to it? It's an interesting question, and not always an easy one to answer. I think that it's difficult to attribute any range of emotion to death simply because the event itself is so charged with certain base emotions that we all share. And because of our shared experience, death personified would appear to be somewhat two-dimensional. Characteristics including heavy, brooding, powerful, stoic, contemplative, frightening, and even cruel, predominate in popular culture, from the Grim Reaper to Joe Black. And we're so consistently exposed to these darker anthropomorphisms that it is difficult to imagine any variation from them. What would the world make of a personified death that grew profoundly sad at the birth of a human being and overjoyed at taking him back at death?     The personification of death is the conceit of The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, a 2006 work which has received numerous awards in both young adult and general fiction categories and has been the recipient of positive reviews all around. It is death that tells the story of little Liesel Meminger s she struggles to make sense of the harsh words and actions of Nazi Germany under the Fuhrer and their effects on the people that she loves. In Zusak's conception, death is one part stoic, one part curious, and one part sympathetic. He seems to have taken a unusual interest in Liesel, which he admits happens very rarely, and he follows her--collecting bodies along the way--through the long years of the war and beyond.     I admit that I liked the book as opposed to disliking it, but I found Zusak's death as two-dimensional as any other representation, meaning that the novelty of the conceit wore off after the first hundred pages or so. And the human characters of the book were not very much more rounded, though it was impossible not to sympathize with orphaned Liesel and her adoptive parents, among others. Themost interesting portions of the book for me were those that dealt with the hidden divide in German society during the war years and the mechanisms set up to root out and punish those that would undermine the Fuhrer and the war effort. At more than five hundred pages, I wish the book had included more of this. As it was, it dragged and I really had to struggle to finish it.    To tell you the truth, I really feel guilty about not liking this book more (especially given all the hype surrounding it). Perhaps it is simply a young adult novel from which I expected too much. Perhaps I am simply a bad reader. Or perhaps the book is simply overrated. I assume that most of you must have liked it. What was it that compelled you?
B0036EH3X4|2.0|What happened, happened: plot holes, tangents, sloppy writing, character dead ends. Few mysteries satisfactorily (or even competently) resolved. LOST was, like the pre-island career Saywer so excelled in, just one long con.    And it's important to keep that in mind because LOST was a commercial enterprise -- neither a life-affirming drama nor mystical exploration. It was always designed to keep viewers engaged, cast/crew employed, the network enriched and sponsors happy. From that perspective, it succeeded tremendously. (And yes, I'll probably buy this season's blu-ray set, like a sucker.)    I was on to the creators' BS campaign when they started backpedaling during the previous season, dropping alibis about \\"character arcs\\", and generally trying to sell everyone a load of crap about how unresolved questions make for better storytelling.    I just wish the creators would have made the effort to reward their audience with something less emotionally manipulative. \\"The End\\" was a cheap ploy that nearly besmirches the entire series legacy. It makes me doubt I'll watch any future program Cuse or Lindelof creates.

Larsson was a captivating writer, and I was pleased to see that all loose ends were tied up quite nicely.

B003L20IDS|3.0|Take \\"Juno\\"'s self-aware hipster irony, put it on steroids, subtract the compelling emotional backdrop that made that film's characters ultimately interesting and vulnerable, and add a whole lot of classic video game references, and you have \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.\\"    That the film lacks any emotional center to speak of doesn't keep it from being plenty entertaining. This is mainly due to Edgar Wright's directing. Wright, the man behind two of the funniest and most inventive films of the 00's, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz,\\" keeps at least the visual aspects of the film constantly interesting. It's not exactly a genre mash-up in the way his other films are; it's based on a comic book, and even when Scott isn't battling opponents in Mortal Kombat-style staging, there's nothing believable to be found here.    Michael Cera plays Scott Pilgrim, a Michael Cera-like slacker whose profoundly inarticulate demeanor and inessential position as a bassist for the unsuccessful band Sex Bob-omb somehow makes him attractive to a variety of females. At the moment it's Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), a 17-year old high schooler with typical Asian high-schooler interests, with whom Scott has an aggressively nonsexual relationship. His bandmates include motivated singer-guitarist Stephen Stills (Mark Webber, whose shared name with the classic rock icon is a questionable reference for the film's target audience), deadpan female drummer Kim Pine (Alison Pill), and background guy Young Neil (Johnny Simmons, not such a questionable reference). He lives in a single apartment in which everything is owned by his assertive gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin). He also has a sister (Anna Kendrick) and a strained friendship with the girl who works at the record store AND the coffee shop (Aubrey Plaza). Scott falls in love with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a low-content character even relative to all the stereotypes listed, and has to battle her seven evil ex's to make the relationship work, or maybe just to keep her attention.    It's not all Wright's direction that keeps things interesting. Culkin steals every scene he's in, Wong adds as much emotional depth as the setup allows, and a good number of the ex's are fun. Sly references to Toronto abound. Every now and then some bit of surreal, not hyper-self-conscious humor breaks through. All in all, it's an entertaining piece of millenial hipster self-congratulation that may invite the critical millenial to wonder what all the congratulation is for.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|The last televised season of \\"24\\" is among its best.<br />Despite the fact that some of the plot triggers and devices that set things in motion have been exhausted more than a few times in previous seasons, season 8 manages to be relentless, gripping, emotional, thought-provoking and, most of the time, realistic and believable.<br /><br />After two unremarkable seasons, the creators of \\"24\\" manage to masterfully pull it all together again, for the last time.<br />The result is a solid season that avoids the pitfalls that made parts of the latest seasons laughable - namely preposterous characters and plot lines, like the terrorist father of Jack and the miraculous resurrection of Tony in seasons 6 and 7, respectively.<br />In here, the impression that the writers have come up with unnecessary events just to keep the episodes coming and justify the name of the series is almost non-existent; the general effect created can be best described as \\"give me more before it ends\\".<br /><br />Possibly the best achievement of season 8 is the creation of the character of President Hassan (portrayed by Anil Kapoor), a leader of a foreign nation that develops to be one of the most memorable and admirable characters of the show. Kapoor manages to pour depth and complexity to his character in a relatively small number of episodes in a series that has become more action than character driven over the years.<br /><br />Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer is excellent as usual. He has had several seasons to grow and improve, and though he has played Jack for such a long time, Sutherland is not careless or tired but focused and resolute and the  viewers will still find it intriguing and exciting to see how Jack would react to the impossible situations brought to his doorstep time and again.<br />Wait for the revenge attack he embarks on in the third part of the season and witness one of the most violent, bloody and angry campaigns he has ever engaged in the show - and prepare to enjoy every minute of it.<br /><br />For the last time on Television, get ready for the wild ride of \\"24\\".

B00000583F|5.0|The early 1990's. I was just a baby.    From what ive read, there were 3 kids who sent a demo tape to all the extreme labels that coveted the underground circles at the time. Underground metal was getting heavier, and edgier. Death Metal Bands started becoming big news, morbid angel and napalm death were on mtv. New orleans became the place for balls out, drug-induced, violent but original and wellplayed metal music and in the mainstream, metallica was selling out stadium's around the world. The Boredoms came to america and unleashed a massive attack of noise on college kids and lollapalooza attendees. Somewhere in europe, the second wave of black metal scene unfolded and the world came to know of some of the most diabolical but most dedicated musicians ever to appear in music history(in my opinion, even w/ varg damaging its reputation massively). Hardcore sadly became a joke, band's like sick of it all and madball took it to a new low, while touch and go became increasingly eclectic, until eventually becoming a more experimental, indie rock kinda label. But even after all that, early 1990's california had produced some of the biggest and best underground acts at the time. Sadly, most would be forgotten for some time until the next generations dug them out again and listened. Sometime in the early 90's three stoners sent a demo tape to the most unlikely of labels (earache is known as one of the primer grindcore labels). Unexpectedly, the guys at earache loved the recordings...a hella of lot. So much, that the label would actually release the same demo tape they sent, and released it w.out any re-recording whatsoever. The cosmos pointed directly at these 3 gentlemen, and Holy Mountain was born...it kicked everyone in the ass.        Sleep's sound was unprecedented. It was influenced much by black sabbath, but only some of the substance really wears off. The vocals, the way some of the riffs are being played are nothing like sabbath's. At times, sleep's arrangements are kept slow, and simple, but extremely dense and loud w/ certain sections becoming devastatingly punishing(the druid for example). This, and the way the guitar's are setup, are probably the reasons why the band reminds everyone of sabbath so much. Honestly, I feel like they have an extremely radical way of doing this old sound, and after couple of spins, any similarity to sabbath disappears as you realize certain how certain elements play out. Sleep have a big crescendo feeling to alot of their song's. Certain songs/sections have riffs played repetitively, till they hypnotize, then climax at the listener and played w/ breakneck intensity. The band's very heavy, and even better is they never sacrifice the sound. When going in different direction's they blend everything quite effortlessly. The solo's are top notch and are never boring. They complement the fire they bring just nicely, and are crazy frantic! Another great attraction from the band is the atmosphere it brings w/ them on everytrack. The album is perfect for getting stoned to. Its perfect music to drive to, w/ the bass bumped justtt a little bit...trust me, bystanders will feel as if a stampede is coming. All 3 members play an equal role into bringing out the beast as well, each one all has its distinct bringing to the songs. Al seems like the more calmer, more mysterious element of the group, bringing alot the funk, and \\"slowness\\" feeling the songs. While Matt is the one that makes everything wild, making the whole thing more savage and heavy. Chris comes to play by mixing both of attributes they have, and playing accordingly to what the passages bring but still bringing alot initiative to each song. Alot of his drumming is pretty unique, esp. on songs like dragnoaut where on the main riff he' bounces his stick on the snare drum in place for a normal snare hit, and interchanges between more basic rhythms and his signature style. He's brings lot's of energy to the riffs, and keeps a subltle but heavy styleto it.    As years passed, sleep would release only one more album, which would feature only one song that lasted over 60 minutes. Not every fan was pleased. Dopesmoker is good, but newcomers would find much more to be thrilled about on this one. Any true metal fan knows, a truly good metal band doesn't have to be ballsout on the music's technicality for it to shine bright. Metal is about its attitude and its power. By adding alot of the classical elements metal has brought upon these past couple years, more and more bands are starting to lose their edge and their flavor. Metal is not about selling tshirts, and being precise. Its about flavor, its about riffs that make you lose touch w/ outside world, its about the sweat drenched  on every bystander next to you at a metal show, and its about energy. All metal fans need to own a copy of this album.

B000WYCF6Q|3.0|I have two of these mirrors on my Bacchetta Corsa recumbent bicycle handle bar.  The Zefal Spy mirrors appear to be cheaply made and I do not expect them to last very long.  The mirror itself displays a highly distorted image, which at first is aggravating.  All that being said . . . I like 'em!  Here's why:  They are very light weight, and they are small and compact.  On my bike, they really look sharp and appear to be custom built just for my bicycle.  Although the image in the mirror is awfully distorted, they clearly show what is behind the rider quite well, and that is really all that is important.  They are a snap to install.  No tools required, just stretch the rubber strap tight on the handlebar and hook it to the tab on the mirror.  I purchased the mirrors through Amazon.  The price was fair and the delivery was prompt.    Denny G  Carlsbad, CA

0385341008|3.0|REVIEWER'S NEGATIVE OPINION:<br />I would have given this book 5 stars for the writing, the personalities, the interactions, the community, and the sweet, lovely, uplifting ending.  But the authors ruined it for me by having eight to ten episodes of Nazi torture and death of good people.  (The eight to ten is an approximate, I didn't count them.)  I would have loved the story if the Nazi parts were eliminated and/or less horrible conflicts were used.  I wish the front cover had a warning about the Nazi horrors.  Publishers Weekly also did not warn me, they just described it as \\"Geurnsey was under German occupation.\\"  Had I known, I would not have read this.<br /><br />I want to feel good when I read.  Years ago I watched several movies about Nazi atrocities and decided to watch no more.  To this day I still shudder with some of those memories.  This book added more horrors to the memories, and they haunt me.  Recently I woke up from a nightmare about it.  What the Nazis did to good people makes me cry.  I hated certain Guernsey people informing on their good neighbors, which caused Nazis to send the good neighbors to concentration camps.  This is fiction, but it's based on the author's research.  I believe these kinds of things happened.  I just don't want to experience them in my pleasure reading.<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />Juliet is a writer in London.  She receives a letter from a farmer in Guernsey which starts a series of letters between Juliet and several people in Guernsey (an island between England and France).  It's 1946, just after the war.  The Guernsey people tell of their experiences during the Nazi occupation of their island.  There are wonderful stories and horrible stories.  After receiving many letters, Juliet decides to visit Guernsey.  She loves the people there.  The entire book consists of letters.  I was surprised at how nicely done it was.<br /><br />A group of locals have book club meetings and call their group The Guernsey Literary Society.  There is a story in the book about why they formed that group during the Nazi occupation.  Potato Peel Pie is another story told in the book.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S POSITIVE OPINION:<br />I loved the people in this book.  I wanted to move to Guernsey and be part of their community.  Many of the stories were uplifting, warm, and welcoming.  I loved Juliet's style of letter writing - so interesting and pleasant.  I wish I wrote letters the way she did.  I listened to the audiobook version.  The narrator for Juliet was wonderful.  She sounded like Julie Andrews (The Sound of Music).  There were several actors doing the narration, and all were good.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Story length: 8 hours.  Swearing language: probably none to mild.  Sexual content: none.

1416589473|3.0|While I found the book entertaining once I got into it, I was also not overly impressed.     Having just come off a 2-yr RA Salvatore/Drizzt bender where I read all of the books in that story arch, I was a little unimpressed with Ghosts straight off the bat from a standpoint of writing style. Though, after getting a little into the book and being introduced to the characters from the various races and seeing the tie-ins with the game world, I was drawn in.     It is a relatively fast read and I think that, overall, it will make the new game even more immersive as it gives breadth to the lore of the world.    Note to the editor: double check references when talking about things that happened earlier in the story. There is a point when the heroes are discussing something that had previously happened and I'm certain that they refer to the wrong city multiple times in the conversation.
B0037QGS0A|4.0|i thought it had a really good cast and that the dynamic between the characters was really good too. it was nice to see amanda seyfried doing a new kind of role and she did an excellent job at portraying \\"chloe\\". julianne moore is pretty much awesome in whatever she does and this was no different. liam neeson wasn't there for some of the shooting because of natasha richardson's skiing accident; but he managed to film all his scenes over a short period of time. i thought this movie was very good (including the storyline) and very sexy too. you aren't really sure what is going on (the truth) until near the end of the movie. the sex scenes are also very hot. i recommend at least giving it a chance and not to be fooled by the negative reviews.

B002VPE1X4|5.0|This is a great case for cameras or GPS units. It's strong, it stretches so it's easy to get things in and out, and its squishy enough to provide good padding for whatever's inside.  The outer pocket can hold at least 4 AA batteries or whatever other small accessories you want.  We were able to put a charger for 2 AA batteries in the outer pocket with spare batteries in it.  It can be put on or taken off of a belt without removing the belt, or can be carried using the included wrist strap.  It doesn't come with a lanyard but you could attach one to the D-ring if you want to carry it that way.  Overall a well thought out and well made product.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell is a wonderful writer, which allows him to question our most celebrated myth:  that of the self-made man and of the American economy as a great meritocracy.  Through use of compelling narratives, Gladwell demonstrates that one rises not through some inherent merit, but by being at the right place at the right time; by working very hard; and by having what Daniel Goleman called \\"emotional intelligence\\" as opposed to IQ.      Of course, the individualist's initial response to all this is that everyone gets opportunities, but the \\"best\\" among us are able to see them and seize upon them.  Gladwell, however, believes that without a proper support network, and without a lot of luck, the individual is not able to seize such opportunities.  He urges us to think more in terms of a community and less in terms of the individual.    So what is to be done?  Gladwell talks about trying to eliminate purely arbitrary breaks such as one's month of birth (which predetermines the success of the older kids in little league cohorts)and setting up systems where all the hidden Bill Gates's and Wayne Gretzkys of the world can succeed.  I think he misses his own point in this regard.  The meritocratic hierarchies we create are inherently false and arbitrary.  We can't engineer things so that all succeed. The whole point of hierarchy is that only a few succeed and that the vast majority who don't succeed nonetheless accept the legitimacy of such a system.      My conclusion from this is that we have to stop thinking so much about competition and individual success and think more in community terms.  Such sentiments are, of course, anathema to Americans and are easily dismissed as \\"communist\\" or \\"socialist.\\"  But they are no less true for being unpopular.
0307463745|4.0|This is a pretty easy read - it took me about three hours to read it all. If you already read Signal v Noise you won't find anything new. If you run (or want to run) a small business then it's probably worth a read, you will find some things to think about and improve how you run things.

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|Those who have followed the X-men trilogy know that Wolverine has some mysterious history, but lacks memory of any of it. This movie explores his history, which is much deeper than anyone could have possibly expected. We know that he has experienced a process by which adamantium was bonded to his bones, but what we didn't know is that, even before he underwent those experiments, he was....different.<br />We meet Wolverine as a child, along with his differently-abled brother, and watch them grow up, always on the move to prevent local people from catching on.<br />As in the other X-men films there is something of a formula, by now well honed: bursts of action/chase/fighting separated by longer periods of story and dialog establishing the convictions of the characters. As the movie progresses, the action becomes more frequent and intense, until a huge showdown conclusion, with a brief epilog looking toward the future.<br />I appreciated seeing how Wolverine's character and personality were shaped by the experiences which he had undergone as he grew up, and how, strangely, his brother had shared many of those same experiences, yet chosen a different path. This seemed very insightful to me, and very reflective of true life.<br />X-men Origins also features a few characters from some of the other X-men films, at a younger stage in their lives, plus introduces a few new characters.<br />Although I hadn't read X-men comic books in decades, I've enjoyed all the movies in the series, this one as much as any of them. Recommended!
0743437497|5.0|SPOILER, AND A MYSTERY    Jack Torrance's life is unraveling. He drinks, he loses his job, he hurts his son. Sounds like a lot of people you might know. Desperate for a job, he takes a position at a creepy old haunted hotel in the middle of winter. Then spooky things start happening. But that's not even the horror part of this story.    What I noticed was that every time something bad happened to Jack, guess who was ALWAYS with him? Good ol' Al Shockley. When he hit a kid's bike in the road (with, mysteriously, no kid attached), Al was with him. When somebody rigged the timer (or did they?), Al was hanging around. When he went to bars and drank, Al was his drinking buddy, even though Al knew Jack had a drinking problem. Al got him the job at the hotel. Good ol' Al. When Jack is killed and his traumatized wife and son are staying with Dick Halloran for a while, what does Wendy say? \\"I think we'll take Al Shockley up on his offer.\\" The end.    OMG. Al Shockley is an undercurrent in this entire book, easy to overlook if you blink, or if you don't understand that Stephen King doesn't put irrelevant characters in his books.    \\"Somebody\\" wants Jack out of the way. Somebody wants control of Danny and his gifts. Why, and who? And what are they going to do with it? You can probably guess who I'm thinking of. The brilliance of this novel is that open-ended question that most readers miss completely - the faint but sinister presence of Al and his undefined motives. A mystery with no ending. A book that's more horrifying for its insinuations than for its graphic imagery. That's probably the reason this book sticks in my memory more than any other of King's works. Brilliant, Steve.

B003O85W44|5.0|Win Bustler sing a couple of times \\"I'm moving past the feeling\\". It could be. He was in his early 20's when arcade fire wrote Funeral, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. There's something more in men than angst or post-adolescent rebellion. Funeral was a bit about this, and, obviously, much much more. They all in their 30's and this albulm sound definitely mature. i don't, personally, recall any of this springsteen echoes taht everybody's talking about: they still powerful and anthemic, and the album lyrics are very interesting unlike Bruce's.  To me Arcade Fire here is talking about the endless struggle between future and past (modernity and suburbs, deep blue and kasparov), and the music fits perfectly (Ready To Start, Modern Man,Rococo, Deep Blue, ecc.)  Arcade Fire are moving - past the feeling and beyound. Us, as listeners, cannot appreciate their desidere to not stay the same forever.

B002VPE1AW|3.0|I liked Avatar, I thought it was an ok movie, I thought Sam Worthington was terribly miscast though (sorry I just don't classify him as a very good actor) although the film did excite me in the battle scenes, I found them terrific.  I still call Aliens Cameron's best movie and have not seen anything even close that tops that all out action gem.  Avatar was not what I thought it was going to be but then maybe I had my hopes raised too high with all the pre-release ballyhoo.  This might just as well have been a Disney Film, you almost expect to hear When You Wish Upon A Star play in the background at any moment.
B0038M61JQ|5.0|The back story of Joe Pass is compelling and fascinating. Virtuoso was released in 1974, but it was by no means Pass' first album. Pass lingered in relative obscurity for many years prior to then, due in part no doubt to drug addiction. But those demons were overcome and Norman Granz, the ubiquitous producer of many great jazz albums, in an act of inspiration put Mr. Pass in front of a mike, alone, and let his talent speak for the ages. The results, \\"Virtuoso\\", sky rocketed Pass to adulation, attention and the top of Down Beat lists of the best guitarist thereafter.   The songs are generally of tried and true standards (Stella By Starlight and 'Round Midnight for example) and one Pass composition, Blues for Alican.   This is the quintessential solo jazz album; inspired, technically great and innovative. You can clearly hear the influence of Django Reinhardt, but Pass definitely has his own voice. This is the Pass album to have, no doubt about it.   As a side note, this album has been remastered under the \\"Original Jazz Classics\\" series. Thus the sound quality is crisp and fresh. I would recommend any in this series, but some, such as this Pass album, certainly are more note worthy.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|There are so many wonderful and insightful reviews of this overlooked charmer there is little more to add.<br /><br />But I did want to emphasize the brilliant visual technique of Ang Lee and how well it works with the story and setting of the film.<br /><br />From the opening sequence, which features bright beautiful purple wildflowers, to the end (with hippie visionary Lang on a white horse, set against an open blue sky), Lee does a fabulous job creating visual cues for this singular coming of age story set against the backdrop of an epic cultural coming of age.<br /><br />I loved the split-screen, loved the colors of the clothing Demitri wears, the composition of the scenes of Woodstock at night, the psychedelics, the organic \\"feel\\" to this film -- it all works.<br /><br />Thanks for bringing this story so brilliantly to life!
006145205X|5.0|This book is very entertaining.  It lays out how human progress has been driven by a mix of evolution, innovation, and trade.  This book rejects the pessimistic viewpoints about humanity's and our planet's future as commonly espoused by media, government, and other organizations.      The book follows the human timeline and shows how evolution and a human willingness to trade has allowed us to specialize and evolve.  The book also outlines how this tendency allows for us to effectively face future obstacles and how government and other \\"top-down\\", mandate driven solutions cause more problems than drive solutions.  For instance, Ridley shows how China's one-child policy was not any more effective at reducing birth rates than allowing for higher standards of living which in turn naturally lower birth rates.    I highly recommend this book!
B003NHRIUW|5.0|Great movie, you laugh, you cry and them you watch it again.  I know Miley got some bad reviews when this movie first came out but I think she did a great job.  Considering the slapstick Hannah Montana acting she has been doing since she was 12y this was a great first attempt into drama.  The other actors are also great.  Greg and Bobby were great, really looking forward to seeing more of Bobby in the future.  Now truly the best part of this movie was Liam Hemsworth.  Great actor, he did a phenomenol job with his accent.  He is going to be big.  Loved the chemistry between the two.

It probably would've been nice to have 2 different songs to replace \\"yellow submarine\\" and \\"all you need is love\\" since those are on other studio albums, would've made the album stand out more probably. The other 4 songs are great, especially George's. The score is nice, and you will find yourself listening to it more than any other score. And you need this to complete your collection! The booklet is fun to read as well.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|Kevin McDonald's 'The Culture of Critique: an Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements' (1998, 2002) describes how \\"Jewish intellectuals initiated and advanced a number of important intellectual movements during the 20th century.\\" McDonald argues that \\"these movements are an attempt to alter Western societies in a manner that would neutralize or end anti-Semitism and enhance the prospects for Jewish group continuity either in overt or in a semi-cryptic manner. Several of these Jewish movements (e.g., the shift in immigration policy favoring non-European peoples) have attempted to weaken the power of their perceived competitors--the European peoples who early in the 20 century had assumed a dominant position not only in their traditional homelands in Europe, but also in the United States, Canada, and Australia...Ultimately, the movements are viewed as an expression of a group evolutionary strategy by Jews in their competition for social, political, and cultural dominance with non-Jews.\\"<br /><br />AMC's 'Mad Men' Season One (2007) and its subsequent seasons are of such exceptional quality that the program practically sets a new standard for television excellence--a very surprising thing to find on American television, whether network or cable, in 2010.<br /><br />Creator, writer, and director Matthew Weiner's 'Mad Men' is about many things, but it is primarily about the end of an era in American history, an era seen by many as one of America's 'Golden Ages,' and one which was culturally, socially, and financially dominated by White Anglo-Saxon Protestants--WASPs.<br /><br />WASPs dominate 'Mad Men,' and while the program is superficially sympathetic to its WASP characters some of the time, the viewer can't help notice how married advertising executive Don Draper's Jewish mistress, department store owner Rachel Menken, eventually makes the 'right' choice of rejecting Draper and wedding a respectable Jewish man. Elsewhere in the show, the Jewish men and women that infrequently flit across the screen (potential clients representing the State of Israel's tourism bureau, etc.) are depicted in  largely agreeable, if stoic, terms.<br /><br />Beneath its always intelligent, amber-hued surface, 'Man Men' is certainly a hard, even an ugly, critique of High WASP culture: though the Drapers and most of the other characters are educated, socially prominent, poised, witty, attractive, and talented, they are also routinely adulterous, alcoholic, and believe women are capable of being little more than sex objects, housewives, or over-the-hill matrons worth deceiving until divorcing.<br /><br />The show's subtitle, in fact, could accurately be \\"Oh, Those AWFUL White People.\\"<br /><br />One account executive is so drunk in the midday office that when he urinates in his trousers, the accident has to be pointed out to him by coworkers. Another character allows his eight year-old granddaughter to drive an automobile through the Hudson River Valley's suburban streets. Ad agency partner Roger Sterling enthusiastically performs Stephen Foster songs in blackface at his palatial Long Island estate, sexually propositions Don's wife the moment Don steps out of the room, and unquestioningly assumes that the models used in agency campaigns will have sexual intercourse with him.<br /><br />A handsome young doctor rapes his newlywed wife on the floor of her office; one presumably loopy secretary runs over and amputates her boss's foot with a riding mower at an office party.<br /><br />The ad executives smoke marijuana and consort with drug dealers, have their secretaries sit on their laps while doing their typing, and steal mail not addressed to them. Account Executive Peter Campbell attempts to blackmail Draper to force a promotion. A comedian, who has everything to lose and nothing to gain in his action, insults the overweight wife of his sponsor. The Sterling Cooper staff believe Nixon is a natural to win the presidency over Kennedy.<br /><br />During a casual business meeting, two of the male staff mock the 'awful aprons' worn by the WASP star of 'The Loretta Young Show Show,' and even the fabric pattern on the same program's sofa, but Jewish Bob Dylan is praised during the same discussion.<br /><br />When Don's beautiful wife, Betty, pushes her adulterous spouse in an explosion of frustration, Don shoves her back with at least equal force. When the Draper family enjoys a picnic on a pristine Hudson River Valley hillside, they blithely leave a small mountain of garbage behind them; Don casually throws his beer bottles in the bushes.<br /><br />Don fires his male art director for refusing the sexual advances of an important client, also male. When Don discovers one of his mistresses has been discussing him with her friends, he forces her arms behind her, ties her to the bed--and leaves her there. Don rejects his younger sibling, Adam, so completely that Adam hangs himself in despair.<br /><br />And most tellingly, handsome, dapper, capable Don Draper is not the educated gentleman of the upper class he pretends to be; he's the illegitimate son of a prostitute who died in childbirth, and who was then abusively raised by 'backward' Pennsylvania farmers.<br /><br />Don is an unconscious misogynist, a compulsive liar, a philanderer, a drunken driver, a sociopath, and a complete fake in almost every sense. His true background is in used cars and furs. Don is false. Though typically presented in the show's deceptively glamorous light, Don is one of Elliot's 'Hollow Men,' empty and stuffed with figurative, existential straw.<br /><br />All of these incidents and characterizations might be expected and wholly acceptable if 'Mad Men' was a typical American soap opera, whether a tradtional daytime melodrama like 'As the World Turns' or a slice of 1980s primetime kitsch like 'Dynasty.'<br /><br />But 'Mad Men' is not a soap opera; 'Mad Men' is a 'serious' drama aspiring to be 'serious' 'art' of a kind (though 'The Jet Set' episode in Season Two, in which Don is taken up by an international set of wealthy vagabonds in California, probably the worst-written of any episode in the first four seasons, veers hilariously towards outright soap opera camp).<br /><br />Much of program is rooted in 'hard' fact (Don Draper is based around legendary ad man Draper Daniels, for example), and appears to accurately reflect history; however, it is WASPs, and by extension, all Europeans of Anglo-Saxon descent who come in for Weiner's and his fellow writers' continuous spleen (copy writer Peggy Olson, for instance, is Catholic and from a lower middle class Brooklyn background). Black and Hispanic characters are few and relegated far to the sidelines.<br /><br />Though the show is thought-provoking, entertaining, and often brilliantly written and produced, the excessive critique of Western European-American culture is unfair to its subject, insofar as Jews, Blacks, and Hispanics are almost completely exempted from the same criticism. When Jewish, Black or Hispanic characters do appear, they are presented as either victims of WASP culture or shrewd individuals who use their intelligence to avoid both victimization and personal moral and ethical failing.<br /><br />Viewers will be hard-pressed to imagine a program with a similar show of teeth being made by Protestants about Jews; the outcry against it would be tremendous, and cries of anti-Semitism would flood the media landscape.<br /><br />'Mad Men' is simply another in a series of 'blows against the empire' WASP America has suffered since the 1960s. It succeeds in its own way because, thanks to the forces aggressively united against WASP America for four decades, many of which are now a dominant presence the media, today almost everyone is quite familiar with the narrative 'Mad Men' is selling: \\"We all know that that is how White people are, and certainly were then.\\"<br /><br />Watch and enjoy 'MadMen'; but by all means watch it critically, as it deserves to be watched, and do not overlook what the show fairly celebrates: the Fall of the American Anglo, which the opening credits dramatize quite literally.g to be 'serious' 'art' of a kind (though 'The Jet Set' episode in Season Two, in which Don is taken up by an international set of wealthy vagabonds in California, probably the worst-written of any episode in the first four seasons, veers hilariously towards outright soap opera camp).<br /><br />Much of program is rooted in 'hard' fact (Don Draper is based around legendary ad man Draper Daniels, for example), and appears to accurately reflect history; however, it is WASPs, and by extension, all Europeans of Anglo-Saxon descent who come in for Weiner's and his fellow writers' continuous spleen (copy writer Peggy Olson, for instance, is Catholic and from a lower middle class Brooklyn background).

It succeeds in its own way because, thanks to the forces aggressively united against WASP America for four decades, many of which are now a dominant presence the media, today almost everyone is quite familiar with the narrative 'Mad Men' is selling: \\"We all know that that is how White people are, and certainly were then.\\"<br /><br />Watch and enjoy 'MadMen'; but by all means watch it critically, as it deserves to be watched, and do not overlook what the show fairly celebrates: the Fall of the American Anglo, which the opening credits dramatize quite literally.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is really hard--what do you say in less than 1,000 words about one of your most favorite films?  And what am I going to say that's different than 800-odd other reviews?  All I can offer is my abiding admiration for this movie.<br /><br />I wrote a 35-page college paper on this film in the spring of 1985, and my narrow-minded snob of a professor rejected it, telling me she'd never seen it, that I'd picked a \\"pop\\" movie.  She directed me to write on the classic--at least she and I agreed on this--[[ASIN:B000055Y0X Dr. Strangelove]] instead (and I still got an A--nyah)!<br /><br />Synopsis: a retired cop-cum-assassin is compelled to return to the job to hunt down and kill a group of manufactured people who have boldly returned to Earth to have their factory-set four-year lifetimes extended.<br /><br />Well, this film, while truly great, just isn't the best film ever made.  Sorry.  It's fun to watch, and is a cornucopia for filmies, but it's no [[ASIN:B000NTPDSW Godfather]], [[ASIN:B00004WLXZ Triumph of the Will]], or even [[ASIN:B000E3L7M8 Swept Away]].  It is a modern classic, no doubt, and it has been massively influential, which is plain to see in [[ASIN:6304698674 Outland]], [[ASIN:B000QTD368 The Fifth Element]], [[ASIN:B0018O4YSQ Dark City]], and so many others.<br /><br />This film is so much more than sci-fi meets film noir.  Its beauty lies in the fact that you can take it as a simple cop-chases-bad-guy flick, complete with intrigue, fights, shooting, and a confused woman with a mysterious past.  Or you can take it as tale of doomed romance.  Or, it's a terrestrial sci-fi adventure, a meditation on the wages of off-world conscript warfare coming home.  It's all of these, and more.  The sci-fi context is a thoroughly realistic and accessible near-future, yet the movie is grounded in a climate-shattered L.A. where the global economy we know now is right in your face, and living in the streets.<br /><br />I absolutely love this film, and have from that autumn night in 1982 when I was one of the few to see it in a theater.  I've seen this film more than 400 times in the past 27 years, I know it all by heart, and still am not tired of watching it; I see something new every time.  From its visually stunning and aurally scintillating opening to the end titles, in all of its various cuts, its soundtracks, its groundbreaking and still-awesome F/X and intricate production values, its feel--more than anything the questions it raises about life, and living a life--the film continues to enthrall me.  As we get ever closer to the day when a \\"manufactured person\\" of real flesh, blood and bone is a reality, the film asks the simple question: what exactly constitutes being human?<br /><br />So, what is human?  How is it defined, and who gets to make the definition?  Simply a creature born of another human?  Or is it the individuality and (for want of a better term) \\"soul\\" living inside an easily replicable biological frame?  Is the concept of a \\"soul,\\" in the context of growing--and selling--fully grown humans for corporate profit, even worth discussing any longer? Can a living thing created in a laboratory, for purely commercial purposes, be considered a human?  Yes, they are faster, stronger, in many ways better than we \\"normal\\" humans, but who wouldn't take those options at birth, if they could be given?  Our almost-protagonist replicants are impetuous, capricious, immature, and then unflinchingly brutal, but then again, that describes anyone we know, or read about in the newspaper every day.  They are self-aware, and fully cognizant of their own mortality, and set about in deliberate fashion to defeat death, and more than anything, this seems to show how truly human they are.  When this film was made, almost 30 years ago, this was far-reaching stuff, real science fiction.  Now, with gene therapy, artificial tissues, experimental replacement organs both synthetic and organic, the opening of public debate about building sex robotsand dating and even marrying automata, the [[ASIN:B0011UF79C Gattaca]] future of genetic options unfolding rapidly, these questions aren't farfetched fiction, they're contemporary.<br /><br />The music: Massive thanks to Vangelis for finally delivering us [[ASIN:B000002IZM his original sountrack]].  It is a masterful rendering of the inspired work that helped make this movie the milestone that it is.  Yes, I'll go on record: I do enjoy the 1982 [[ASIN:B000002KYK New American Orchestra recording]] that came out in the 80s.  Despite what the purists say, these are satisfying symphony orchestra covers of Vangelis' unmistakable soundtrack originals, softened and de-electronified, somewhat more commercially accessible.<br /><br />If you've read Philip K. Dick's original novel, then you will know that this is the very basic story, but little else of that translates here.  If you love the movie, you might like the book, but be warned that Dick's writing style, while full of imagination and observations on issues of humanity in the face of scientific advancement--he wrote the originals that became Total Recall, Minority Report, and Paycheck, after all--can be, well, slow.<br /><br />If you love this film, you must read Paul Sammon's Future Noir.  It is the definitive saga of the making of this film, and is full of incredible trivia, like how Robert Mitchum was the original vision of Deckard, and how Dustin Hoffman interviewed/auditioned for the role for months.  Or the fact that in some of the cityscapes, old Star Wars Millennium Falcon models were used in the background.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a classic, enduring American film, right up there with On the Waterfront, Taxi Driver, The Wizard of Oz, etc.  Its vision is breathtaking, and its single-minded attention to detail makes it come flawlessly together.  Whether or not you enjoy science fiction, this film will touch some part of you.SIN:B0011UF79C Gattaca]] future of genetic options unfolding rapidly, these questions aren't farfetched fiction, they're contemporary.

B002H3T3TM|3.0|I recently arrended a Michael Buble show with my fiance and was amazed at his grasp of  his medium so it was a no brainer ro buy this DVD to carch up on what I had missed. Sadly, the viewing experience was not as good as I hoped it would be.    The film focuses on the days leading up to Buble's first Madison Square Gaeden show. It features interviews with Buble and his band and film clips of highlights of the concert. Unfortunately ay a mere 68 minutes it does not feature the entire show. The film has its moments:a discussion of starting ar the famed Blue Note six years previously, the interaction og Buble and his musical director but the moments have a tendency to feel staged.    The BluRay disc features the main program and two bunus songs. This one would work best as a bonus feature on a complete concert film. It is for true fans or those who just want to check out a small snippet of the performer's work.
1416589473|4.0|The book goes into some pretty decent detail over fight scenes (you get a pretty well rounded idea of the kinds of skills that will appear in the game). Characters are well written and involved, which I like. The only problem I had was the fact that they rest a lot, which became repetitive after a while. Descriptions of the areas that were travelled in were a little murky, but you get the general idea of what to imagine. The ending was weird - nuff said.    Would I recommend this book? If you have never played the game - no. If you have enjoyed Guild Wars then buying this book will definately enhance your experience.
B003DQOWNE|5.0|With their second album, the Swedes of Enforcer come back with pretty much the same formula they had developed on their tasty debut, 2008's Into the Night. We're still in known territory with their speedy, melodic NWOBHM-oriented heavy metal that sounds an awful lot like early Iron Maiden minus the punky influences. The main difference here is that they slowed things up a bit, adding a little hard rocking fun for good measure (quite possibly originating from early-Def Leppard and Tygers of Pan Tang) which suits their catchy compositions nicely.  The few misfires of singer Olof Wikstrand have also been corrected when compared to Into the Night and he's much more in control of his high-pitched spectrum on Diamonds than he was on Enforcer's debut offering, to the point that he often sounds a bit like The Darkness' singer, the awful Justin Hawkins, only a lot less annoying and way \\"gutsier\\". Diamonds also has quite a lot of backing vocals \\"à la\\" Def Leppard which contribute to enlighten the overall performance of the vocalist.  The production of Diamonds is the other good news when comparing it with its predecessor. Where Into the Night was bordering on amateurism, Diamonds is a feast for the ears with its precise and dynamic sound, not modern in any way, this production, firmly rooted in the era Enforcer reveres is exactly what the band needed.  Another good thing about Diamonds is its moderate length, it seems that the band has focused on its strongest material and, thus, delivered a no-filler 40 minutes album which brings it even closer to the good-ole-times Heavy Metal albums formula it seems to rely on.  I realize I haven't spoken of any song in particular. The reason is simple actually, Diamonds is an effort that you listen from start to finish with a big smile on your face, an horned fist risen in the hair and hair all over the place with demented headbanging. Really, If you are a fan of old-school Heavy Metal, this is a mindblowing trip down Nostalgia Lane. Anyway, if I had to mention 3 songs from Enforcer's mighty collection it'd probably be Roll the Dice and its delightful \\"disco-rhythmed\\" solo break, Katana and its 6 minutes of pure epic melodic Heavy Metal or the eponymous instrumental with its exquisite dueling guitars and even a little surprise towards the end of it. But, really, all the songs featured here are great so it's hard to see those three as highlights as I truely consider the album as a whole and have no real favorite among those 10 kick-ass tunes.  To sum things up, Diamonds is undoubtedly a must hear for anyone favoring old-school heavy metal especially in times where double bass too often takes the control. Sure, it's nothing new or groundbreaking, it's just fun albums that makes you headbang like crazy and, trust me, there's nothing wrong with it and when it's so amazingly done, it leaves with a sore neck, a silly smile on your face and... Hungry for more!

006145205X|3.0|AS I was reading \\"Rational Optimist,\\" I found it filled with fascinating and yes, uplifting, encouraging information.  Ridley is a terrific writer and he brings great storytelling skills to the most arcane topics--helping us to imagine a poineer family's life compared to ours, for example, and making the point as concretely as it can be made that our lives are better.  And that there are reasons to think that many things will in fact continue to get better for most of humanity.    And then since finishing the book I've read some pointed criticism of it, and I can see the critics' points.  There was a certain amount of cherry-picking going on, and the happy talk about climate disruption was so understated that I, frankly, didn't even notice as I was reading that Ridley was engaged in a form of climate change denial.    Also, I think the earth is beyond its carrying capacity for human population.  Ridley's optimism, in retrospect, might be too relentless and not realistic enough.  \\"Optimist\\" makes a wonderful compendium of fascinating information, brilliantly presented, and makes an excellent balance to some of the overly pessemistic \\"gloom and doom\\" tomes probably more common in the marketplace...but taken as a whole, the argument doesn' pass the sniff test.  Read with all critical faculties fully employed, and read around what scholarly critics have said about the book, and about Ridley's involvement in a British bank, and let that information at least temper your opinion.   Optimism is a wonderful thing, but if it is founded on unreliable ideas, it can prevent us from seeking solutions or ignoring warning signs.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in an impoverished and very rural part of the Missouri Ozarks. She has to look after her crazy-sick mother and two younger siblings; her father Jessup has vanished. We learn quickly that Jessup cooked crystal meth - the major means of support for many of the families in this area - and that he had been caught a couple of weeks previously, and put up his house and property for bond. Now he's disappeared, and the house and land will be taken away from the family if he can't be found, so it's up to Ree to find him. Unfortunately, even though nearly all of the exhausted, depressed and sullen people she comes across in her odyssey through the gloomy, blighted yet beautiful landscape of rocky hills and scrubby forests are related to her, very few of them are willing to give her so much as the time of day. Suspicious of the law, they're unwilling to even help one of their own stave off homelessness - and some of them are more than willing to show her what comes of asking too many questions.<br /><br />This is a really powerful and stark, unsentimental look at the underbelly of American rural life. Most of the characters here are really unpleasant, even downright hateful, prone to quick violence and selfish and paranoid in the extreme - at least, on the surface. One of the most brilliant facets of this excellent film, cowritten and directed by Debra Granik, is that it slowly reveals a modicum of humanity in most of these gruff exteriors - and also shows that for all of Ree's bearing as someone who stays away from drugs herself and is trying to keep her family going, she's just as much a part of this tragic and beat-down culture as the rest of them. It's sad but not surprising for example that she never even THINKS to go to any authorities to help find her father - even once she starts to suspect that he's been killed, and knows who the killers are likely to be. Even when she's been beaten half to death, she relies only on herself and, eventually, her uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes), a frightening and clearly very violent man who nevertheless has a streak of decency as regards his own family, and a pride in helping out those who need it.<br /><br />Hawkes is getting a lot of justifiable praise for his performance, which should end up winning plenty of Supporting Actor awards as the year goes on, but the 19-year-old Lawrence does just as good a job in a much less show-offy role, always convincing as a determined and still vaguely hopeful young woman just on the cusp of learning that life isn't going to be good for her if she stays here. All of the women and men we see who are significantly older than her seem prematurely aged - Teardrop looks close to 60 but is probably supposed to be in his early 40s, and the women look even more haggard and abused. And yet there's never any question that Ree is going to leave her family behind; even when she goes to an Army recruiter, we know that she's only going because she doesn't really know how it works, a naivete that she'll soon lose, along with, most likely, her hope and dreams.<br /><br />Shot digitally but hauntingly beautiful and never feeling \\"cheap\\" despite it's obvious low budget, this is a film that respects the people and the landscape even if it's frustrated with them, and saddened. I expect this will be in my year-end top 10.eventually, her uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes), a frightening and clearly very violent man who nevertheless has a streak of decency as regards his own family, and a pride in helping out those who need it.

B002VECLVO|5.0|Beautifully staged and photographed, the picture looks like something from the hand of a renowned fashion designer.  That's not meant to be a criticism but a compliment as the feel of the film is crucial to its enjoyment as a period piece.  Colin Firth and Julianne Moore are excellent, Firth really is more than that: brilliant.  The film has been criticized for its seemingly arbitrary ending.  I didn't mind it but can understand why it left some unsatisfied.  If this is his debut, Tom Ford should be at the beginning of a brilliant second career.

0143118420|3.0|The prose is very well written and descriptive. The author really did take me on her journey; in many ways I did feel transported. Also, it is impossible not to do some soul searching of your own when she is doing it on literally every page.   However, there is much that she left out of the book. She admits that she did not explain why she left her husband. She says this is to spare him the grief of having him have to read about it in her book. That's fine and dandy, but it leaves her seeming extremely selfish and shallow. Soul searching around the world and helping strangers is nice, but when you have left your family and your husband with almost no explanation save for \\"I'm not fulfilled\\", it's hard to sympathize. Perhaps she really was unhappy. Sometimes a great man is not always a recipe for happiness. However, it just did not seem that she tried at all... which made the episode with David seem like karma.  All in all, I would still recommend this book as I did find it enjoyable. However, I must warn you that it left me with a sour aftertaste. She went to find happiness around the world and learned to love herself.... at what price? I just hope that women who read this and are not entirely fulfilled in their own lives just don't pick up and run off to Bali, leaving their husbands along the roadside. Most couples' relationships are complicated and unless there is abuse (phyical or mental or otherwise), therapy would usually be the 1st step before booking 4 months in an ashram in India.
0307460444|2.0|Anyone who gave this book 5 stars probably hasn't actually made any of the recipes.  The cupcakes look pretty in the book, but are not up to the caliber that I would have expected.  Frankly, a mix from a box makes a better quality cupcake than these recipes.  The dark chocolate frosting recipe does not work as written-huge disappointment.  If you want pretty cupcakes but don't care about the consistency, this might be a good book for you-it's very heavily focused on decor.  If you want good quality cupcakes that are light and fluffy, this is not the book for you.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|...albums I've heard in a long time. Mumford & his \\"Sons\\" really know what they're doing. I love the recent trend towards folk oriented sounds and most of the bands involved are among my favorites. I took a listen to this band and found a sound that has a little more gruffness to it and that brings to mind the old Clancy Brothers Drinking-songs/Sea Chantys/Songs of Rebellion kind of feel. It's not at all hard to imagine the boys tearing it up in a village pub in some northern town. I can't explain how, but something about them reminds me of The Band, don't ask me why, not specifically the music,but the heart that they put into it. This is well worth having, and I recommend it highly.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|This album and Florence's voice really struck a chord with me. She has a unique warble that I appreciate. Other than her voice, the music itself has a pretty wide range of sounds varying from Rabbit Heart which feels 90s and Dog Days remix which feels very modern. It all manages to me cohesive and touching. One of my favorites has to be the Cold War Kids cover they did of Hospital Beds. I think it's because I am a fan of her voice in the blues realm.
B001E4F5RO|5.0|Expected to enjoy the book and was not disappointed. Not only were all of te Greek Gods there, but each had rich personalities and were full of the angst I had only read about in junior high. I felt I got to know them personally. Who they are and what they rule is firmly entrenched in my mind.<br />The author wittingly or unwittingly cracked open a market by appealing to troubled children. The origins of dyslexic and ADHD children are brought to light. They are the half human half God children sired by one of the many Greek Gods ad a human. It's no wonder kids are gobbling this series up.<br />The story is narrated by Percy Jackson. The metaphors draw images and feelings explicitly for the reader. I am a Harry Potter fan. I enjoyed this book more and am looking forward to the rest of the series. Not only does it entertain, it teaches the reader Greek mythology, too.<br />I highly recommend the book.<br />'''''

9889979942|5.0|Anyone who has travelled through China, especially on a shoestring, knows the difficulties involved - the language barriers, the discomfort of travel, the great distances - despite the many rewards received along the way from an open and welcoming population. Full credit to Tom Carter, then, for persevering in an epic two-year trek around all 33 provinces and special regions of the People's Republic - from frozen north to tropical south, desert west to metropolitan east, and everything inbetween.     What this book does best of all is show that China is a world unto itself, a vast place of great variety, and not the monolithic state it often seems in the media. By depicting hundreds of the people he met on his journey, Carter gives China a human face.
B003JTHESA|5.0|I just got done listening to Final Frontier, and I must side with those clear thinking maiden fanatics who believe that Final Frontier is a great to classic album.  I honestly believe that this is their best work since Seventh Son. Now, here's why.  In my opinion, Final Frontier is a synthesis of everything good that Maiden has ever done, and even incorporates a little taste of Bruce Dickinson's outstanding solo material.  I can hear the best influences from Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, Seventh Son, Power Slave, X-Factor, Brave new World, Dance of Death, and A Matter of Life and Death, even the best parts of Virtual XI (which were few and far between) as well as new textured arrangements previously not done before by Maiden. I even hear influences from the solo albums of BD including the brilliant juggernaut Chemical Wedding, the excellent Accident at Birth, and even the incredibly underrated Skunkworks, and the awesome Tyranny of Souls. And what is downright astounding here is that Iron Maiden makes it work in leap and bounds on Final Frontier.  it's got something for everyone who has traveled long and wide with the band's music at their side.     I still find Maiden to be the purest form of classic power Metal, and Final Frontier is both epic and immediately accessible.  Satellite 15... Final Frontier is obviously two parts- the intro and the song itself.  The intro is progressive and interesting, but the actual song (Final Frontier) is a bona fide instant classic, hands in the air anthem.  El Dorado has a rip roaring groove, and after hearing it I just wanted to jump on my motor cycle with a beautiful blonde lovely in tow and rip down the open road (it's old school, but definitely accessible in today's metal market, and I can't really seem to put my finger on how IM manages to straddle that line.  It's just such a great song, heavy and hands in the air, and blood pumping. Mother of Mercy- it's a heavy galloping head stomper, another strong track, and pretty close to a classic.  Coming home is somewhere between a ballad and an anthem, and the darn thing works.  Another bona fide classic.  Highly emotional track and lyrics.  The Alchemist is a little piece of mind, number of the beast , x-factor, power slave, and it's just an outstanding track with a ripping chorus and hooks you in- Instant Classic.  Isle of Avalon is another strong layered track, that is very good but probably requires a few listens- More than meets the eye.  Starblind- Instant riproaring classic- complex drum textures overlay with ripping hooks and chorus. Another classic- like something off of Fear of the Dark, and Seventh Son but detuned and heavier.  Talisman- Another very good track in the vein of Dance of Death and A Matter of Life & Death- probably requires more than one listen.  The Man Who would be King and When the Wind blows are reminiscent of Power Slave and the newer Dance of Death, and A Matter of LIfe and Death, and they work even though the two two songs are a combined 20 minutes in length.  These will probably become Maiden staples with the former probably hitting classic status.  They require you to listen to them as they are very complex layered and textures songs.     The production seems very good, with Bruce's vocals sounding pretty strong (he's lost a bit, but he still has the most majestic pipes in the business.  Final frontier is anthemic, uplifting, dark, and complex, and simple, all in the same.  I believe that this album will really be appreciated down the road as a complete album that stands the test of time.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it is in my opinion an outstanding entry into the Maiden catalogue. Up the irons, and thanks for reading.

142314189X|5.0|I love the books.  I started reading them after I saw the movie.  I like the books so much better.  The movie was good but it's nothing like the book.  I got the hardback set because the books just look better on the bookself.  :-)
B002AEB8P0|5.0|It's a great album and even more that I hoped for. Amazon  is a great company through which I was able to get this selection with  timely and quality delivery.  I highly recommend  this artist as well as Amazon.com.
B0034YXY5C|5.0|I bought the book after watching the The Ninth Gate hoping to make sense of the movie. Since then Arturo Perez Valverde is one of m favorite authors. This book has two stories in parallel, the first about a cub of Dumas fans where each member adopts a chapter and a character from Dumas, the second story about the pursuit of a pact with a devil as per a centuries old book. Either story would make a good book on it's own, together they make for many hours of delightful entertainment. The erudition of the author is manifest in the multiple accurate references but the book always reads as the fun Novel it is.     Some of my favorite scenes are the seduction of Corso by the mysterious girl that accompanies him, particularly the play of thrill shadows in the bedroom before they touch each other. Corso's impotence their first time together is hilarious.    I recommend also the Queen of the South set in modern times and the Flanders Panel.
0061537969|5.0|I just finished this book, and I'm still drying my tears.  Wow!  it was beautiful.  I read it in Spanish, but I'm sure in English it's just as powerful.  I've never been a dog person, but from the beginning of the book Enzo is such a lovable and intelligent character I kept reading.  There are so many sections of this book that are so shallow and yet so profound.  It'll make me rethink all my ideas about dogs (and animals in general), and NASCAR fans.  When I look into my friend's black lab's eyes, I'm going to have some questions for him.  The relationship between master and dog was amazing too, better than any love story I've read lately.  Who knew dogs were romantic?
B001PU8N0I|5.0|My daughter and I watched the entire set in the last week - it was wonderful. Was expecting it to be too gloomy but found it to be one of the best sets we have seen. We are great lovers of all Jane Austen dvd's and think this is comparable to the best of those.
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is probably one of the best feel good movies I've seen in a long time.  Its not just a chick flick.....there is something in there for everyone and  the hidden messages about how to sustain a relationship are well played.
0385335482|1.0|I bought this as a book on tape (the unabridged version) for a long car ride.  I've read several of Kinsella's other books & was a huge fan so I decided to try the Shopaholic series out.  I could not stand it!  Rebecca is such a delusional, irresponsible, selfish girl that I could not enjoy her.  I really wanted to like her, but as the book went on, she just annoyed me.  I found myself yelling at my car stereo for her - DON'T BUY IT or WHY DID YOU DO THAT YOU NINNY?  I can't believe this book got so many good reviews.  The main character was so unlikable that when the book ended I was very perturbed that she never got her comeuppance.  I can't believe the girl acted like an immature moron the whole time, avoiding all her problems & then gets rewarded with the dream job, the rich boyfriend, and never really has to suffer any consequences! I am so mad I spent money on this.
0307454541|3.0|I dated a Swedish man and am somewhat familiar with the culture which sets the tone of this book. The main character is passive. There is a reason for it. Swedish men are not too emotional, passive and are very matter of fact about sex and relations, at least in my experience. Swedish women are more aggressive and out-going.  So the main character is a true male Swede as he should be written by a male Swede, but is somewhat boring. So if you are looking for a dynamic, sensitive character, forget it with a Swede male. I think the thriller line of the book was a passible one but similar to many other novels. And the running theme of violence against women and animals is overdone. In Sweden, it is the immigrant men that are causing violence problems not the native Swedes. So I don't get the author's point socially about the violence. Maybe men in Sweden hate women but it is because the women are in control there, not because there is an inbred hatred of women. I don't know what happened to all those virile Viking men of the olden days, but I guess they left for greener pastures and the women took over.<br /><br />I do think that the book is a good translation of Swedish given the difference in the languages. It is very detailed in its description of business enterprise and such and that part can be boring to some of us. It is somewhat gory in the murder/rape scenes but not nearly as gory as other books. All in all, it is nice read if you like details, but pales in comparison to other mysteries or thrillers. I'm use to James Patterson who has much better Detective type heros and plot lines in his novels so I was just not impressed. But given the culture the author came from, he did a good job in portraying mystery in Sweden. But others like it so we all differ in opinion. Personlly, I won't bother to read the rest of the novels.
B003JTHETY|5.0|Honestly, I am quite sickened, shocked, and puzzled by the negative reviews here. It's not just here but it's on other sites as well. Seems like many Maiden fans out there want the band to play the same old 4 minute songs. Maiden built their fame with those classic 80s songs, but those songs have already been written! The guys are older and it's time for them to move on. This album, in my opinion, is their best since '88s Seventh Son. I mean, the Rush-influences, and proggy-direction is AMAZING! I friggin' love every song on here. This is indeed a different Maiden album, but in a very good way. None of these songs even feel long. What is 9 minutes lasts for what seems like half that time! The album goes by quick, and there are a lot of memorable moments on this record. The breakdowns on a couple of the songs are just mind blowing and spectacular. The ballad \\"Coming Home\\" is INCREDIBLE! I can't wait to hear this song live and sing a long the chorus with the thousands of Maiden maniacs! All the songs are my favorites, but besides \\"Coming Home\\", \\"The Talisman\\" is one that keeps getting repeated listens. It starts with a great acoustic intro (JANICK IS THE MAN!), and after the first 2 and a half minutes, explodes into a headbangin' riff... The chorus is amazing... especially the \\"WEEEEEESTWARD WE SAIILL\\" part, which has Bruce hitting notes that I haven't heard him hit in a very long time. Another song I can't wait to hear live. Everyone's performance is absolutely AWESOME! Adrian wrote a lot of the material, and he's obviously the dominant guitarist on this album, but each and every one stands out as well. Bruce sounds excellent throughout the album, and he still got the air raid siren he's famous for! Listen, Iron Maiden are the most influential and inspiring heavy metal band of all time... this new album shows them trying out new things, and it does not fail! Do yourself a favor, you're on this webpage for a reason... you're checking out to see The Final Frontier. People, BUY IT! Just BUY IT!! BUY 2 COPIES like I did!! Buy the album. Let's see heavy metal at #1 on the charts! Support heavy metal, support Iron Maiden, buy the records! This album will not disappoint! If you do buy it, and don't like it after your first listen, listen again, and again, and again, and again, completely brainwash yourself to love it!! It's only 10 bucks, just BUY IT! It's a masterpiece of epic proportions! UP THE IRONS!!
1416550550|5.0|There are very few authors who can effortlessly switch between different time periods throughout a novel. Kate Morton is most definitely one of them. This novel flows beautifully and is not stilted or confusing as many novels written this way are.<br />As the story unwinds, the different parts of the novel slowly unite to form a whole. The reader sets out to piece together the puzzle and therefore when the novel draws to a close the reader is left with no strings left untied. This novel leaves you with a lot to think about. Once the mystery is solved you cannot help but go back and think through everything now that you have the benefit of hindsight.<br />Kate Morton has written a wonderful story that encompasses a complete range of human emotions--from the very best, to the very worst.<br />A must-read.

B0029XFNA8|4.0|This is a great investment! Although I would have enjoyed seeing the color version in HD just as well as the B&W it was well worth my money and the video quality is outstanding, along with the 5.1 DTS-HD MA.
B003ES5JDS|5.0|Another classic movie for the greatest comic character ever created. As good as the last 2 classic movies and the animated series. I highly recommend this movie for all Batman fans and superhero fans in general.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Good acting, good script, good directing.  This movie entertains, informs and gives solid facts about our second American president and all that he did for this country.
1594488843|5.0|Carrot and stick recognition and rewards have been around for so long they appeared sacred and etched in stone. Until now.   The fact that businesses use carrots and sticks does not mean they are effective. Dan Pink has brought science and research into the mix to see what truly motivates people today.   Our workplace book club is reading DRIVE and it certainly has sparked a lot of discussion - everyone has an opinion! We previously read Dan Pink's A WHOLE NEW MIND in 2008. Not only has DRIVE made me rethink current reward and recognition practices at work, but these concepts have far reaching applications in how we relate to everyone we meet. Well done Mr. Pink!
B002VPE1OS|5.0|Really does what it's advertised to do and at a reasonable price.  Nobody seems to have resolved my issue of having my sweat and makeup rub off onto the phone screen after long phone calls, but hey, at least the iphone's actual screen is being protected.
B003K025TQ|5.0|Having BB King, Steve Lukather, Slash, George Benson, Robert Cray, Pat Martino and John Scofield all on one CD may sound like covering too many bases at once, but the elite level of musicianship shared among those listed elevates this release into quite a listening experience. And lest we forget-the main one behind all this is \\"Captain Fingers\\" Lee Ritenour who plays and produces this musical marvel. The variety of artists shows the variety of musical styles. You have straight-ahead, hard rock, classical, blues, smooth jazz and other styles as well. The result? Diverse yet unified; everything just seems to gel together and have a nice flow to it.    If you're studying guitar or just plain like guitar, this album is a certified must-have. Enjoy.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|I bought this for my husband, and although I had no interest in seeing it, I watched it with him and it turned out to be an excellent movie. I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys action or country western genres.
0312995423|2.0|I really expected more from this author - I kept reading thinking it was going to get better and it just never did. I think the theory and base story line with the code cracking and conspiracy elements were cool to start off with and that's probably why I kept reading, but the whole thing just fell flat for me, even with the cheesy proposal I just couldn't enjoy the book.
B003TT2X72|1.0|This is the same OLD THEATRICAL EDITION ONLY NONSENSE.  GIVE US SEAMLESS BRANCHING WITH EXTENDED EDITION TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY!  They have the technology for many years now to use seamless branching to release THEATRICAL AND EXTENDED CUTS of these movies to make everyone happy.  To release only the theatrical cuts is just pathetic milking attempt.  I purchased the extended versions on DVD and will not purchase any Lord of the RINGS BLU RAY until teh EXTENDED VERSIONS are available.  SEAMLESS BRANCHING WAS INVENTED MANY YEARS AGO, YOUR A BUNCH OF IDIOTS and COMMUNITY COLLEGE DROPOUT MARKETING DEPARTMENT.  Go eat seome TACO BELL and McDonald's while your at it!
0545128285|5.0|This book provides a nice little glimpse into a bit of Pottermania and provides a more detailed extension of this part of the main story line and why Hermione receives the book - even though it's explained in the main story this little bit extra and seeing the story for yourself is a brilliant and fascinating adventure.
0393078299|5.0|Quantum is a well written and documented view of a scientific revolution and how the \\"players' in the field interact, argue and strive to gain their colleagues approval of their perceptions of how nature works. While some knowledge of physics is helpful, the layman can easily follow the human interactions and gloss over the details of \\"thought experiments\\".
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I had read alot of negative comments about this season such as it was too dark etc. We finished it last night and wow! Awesome end to an awesome season. I felt John Lithgow was creepy and his mind all over the place which added to his character Trinity. Dexter season 4 didn't directly involve the baby too much which I was kind of worried about so that was nice. Also, the side stories were kind of interesting although I cannot stand Quinn. Quinn is no Doakes which I really thought was an excellent addition and Quinn is quite annoying (well to me at least). Anyhow, Dexter season 4 still has all the aspects you would expect and keeps you entertained. I really enjoyed how everything unfolded from the first episode to the last, very intelligent. I do not have Showtime so I simply wait and watch them all at once. I am SO anxiously awaiting the next season but have a long wait I know. Definitely worth your time and money!
B003JTHETY|1.0|As stated in another review, this Mission Edition is not so special considering all of the extra content is located online.<br />I was hoping that i would have the video on a disc and other \\"cool\\" things but the bonus site leaves alot to be desired.<br />Now, the music on the other hand gets 10 stars! Amazing Progessive Metal. I love it!
1593082649|5.0|I am a Jane Austin fan so I am reading all her books this year I was surprised at how different Northanger is. But i absolutely loved it. Catherine is a great heroine the story is magical. I found it a lot easier of a read. Sometimes the old english writing of the Jane Austin books makes me have to concentrate harder, but this was written in a style easier to read. It's a page turner. You won't want to put it down. For those who love Jane Austin and love her take on the gothic novels of her time enjoy!!
0743201140|1.0|I ordered this book about a week ago and it just shipped and it says that it is estimated that it will take 3 weeks to get to me!!! This is ridiculous. Never ordering from them again!
B0000691U1|5.0|This seminal recording is just amazing. The interaction among these giants is clearly palpable. Buy it and share it with your friends!
B0037MNKDC|4.0|I give this episode 4 stars because the characters are rich in a way that only, to me, southern characters seem to be. Maybe its the \\"twang\\" and inflections in their speaking. I don't know, but I like it.<br /><br />I agree with the first reviewer in that this show is LOADED with sexual inuendo and sex in general. Cable tv goes a touch overboard in that department because they can get way with so much. After a while, it becomes gratuitous rather than a plot device. Put the kids to bed before watching this show.<br /><br />I have a complaint about the character \\"Tara.\\" Is it me, or does she BADLY need a beating? She's what I like to call \\"respect deficient.\\" People in our society seem to have forgotten the difference between respect and courtesy. EVERYone is deserving of courtesy, but NO ONE deaserves respect who hasn't earned it unless they hold positions of authority like police officers, your boss, or the president. I don't like Obama, but he has my respect for achieving his position and holding that office. Tara definitely needs a lesson in the difference.<br /><br />As to Vampires? I LOVE vampires, but in this first episode you dont get much in the way vampir-\\"isms.\\" A few peeks ans snatches of lore, maybe, but its not a bloodfest. At least, not in episode one. A definite good show for those who like vamps though.
B003JTHESA|5.0|There must be alot of people that have ADD or demand absolute instant gratification. I'll admit that Satellite 15 and the title track is the weakest song on the album. Maybe the Album should of opened with El Dorado because it rocks with hints of Moonchild in the intro riff.  I would have opened the album with Mother of Mercy and gone right into The Alchemist. Mother of Mercy is very dynamic with great lyrics and The Alchemist is a solid Iron Maiden rocker. Starblind has a perfect short intro that reminds me of No More Lies from Dance of Death, then goes into a dark off time galloping rhythm with Bruces' dramatic vocals and jazzy guitar riffs in the back ground. Starblind will take you on a journey. The Talisman's intro could have a separate song title and it's a perfect mystic intro. Bruce vocals in the intro is like he is telling a story. The Talisman then takes off with another dark aggresive galloping rhythm. Then following with a classic Iron Maiden guitar harmony riff. The bridge section displays a more traditional Iron Maiden galloping rhythm. The solo section is very moody and reminds me of Richie Blackmore's Rainbow and ends with a catchy guitar riff done by all three guitarist. The Talisman could of been the best song on Dance of Death album. When the Wild Wind Blows if definitely one the best Iron Maiden songs ever written. There is so much going on, Bruce sounds unbeat and possive and the lyrics are dark and depressing. Bruce also sounds just a bit different at the end... more deep and matter of fact sounding.    The other songs are great too... The Isle of Avalon is different and unique. The solo section is kinda like psychedelic jazz or fusion. The man who would be king is good but not great. Still The Final Frontier has such strong songs that it deserves 5 stars. Buy it and listen a few times. Sooner or later you'll be entertained and hungry for more.
B003JTHESA|5.0|This is yet another masterpiece from Iron Maiden.I will not attempt to compare this to other Iron Maiden albums.I am simply floored,though,by some of the negative reviews I've read here.I rarely give a review.I just could not bear not weighing in,to get the star rating up on this one.This album gets better with each listen,yet I LOVED it on the first listen.I also feel that it gets better with each track.Music perfection to me,and easily the best rock album in a long long time.
0143038419|4.0|These are the true events of love lost/gained, inner peace found and food enjoyed (not necessarily in that order) by author Elizabeth Gilbert.<br /><br />My favorite parts were the time spent at the Buddhist temple and the scenes with her friends while she collected money to buy a new home/work space. The least interesting was the mentioning of the different romances in her life. I felt like that was the back story, and the main thing was that she learned to be herself.<br /><br />I enjoyed much of this book, even though the author and I have different thoughts on life and love.  In fact, I did not realize until I read this book what I thought of certain things.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I was a happy [[ASIN:B00015GYU4 Nikon SB-800]] user for a couple of years, until someone stole it and I had to find a replacement to use with my (aging, but still great) [[ASIN:B0009GZANC Nikon D50]].    I would have been perfectly happy to get another SB-800, but of course the SB-900 replaced it, and the discontinued SB-800 now regularly sells for about $300 more than the updated version. (Which makes zero sense, but nevermind.)    I was reluctant to upgrade to the SB-900, as it's a bit larger and a bit heavier than the SB-800 was. At the same time, the [[ASIN:B0002EMY9Y Nikon SB-600]] is a bit less versatile, and while I don't really need the advanced capabilities of the SB-900 with the D50 today, I might in the future if I upgrade my camera body, so the SB-600 doesn't seem like a good investment.     So, I got the SB-900 last weekend. And hoo-boy was it worth it. Yes, it's nominally bigger & heavier than the SB-800, but in practice it doesn't feel like it is. The SB-800 felt a bit denser & heftier, while the SB-900 has a nicer balance with the weight. Maybe I'm just seduced by the edges being a bit curvier than the SB-800, which felt a bit more angular at the corners, but whatever it is, the physical size of the thing doesn't seem like it's going to be an issue.     The controls are simpler & clearer than they were with the SB-800, not least because the on/off switch is a paddle-switch now, rather than a push-button, which sounds trivial, but it's a nice change. The LCD display has been upgraded as well, with smaller, clearer fonts than before, while also having room for more information than the SB-800 display could present.     Another nice change: the flash head can now rotate 180º in both directions, unlike the SB-800, which could go to 180º one way, but only 90º the other way. Again, this isn't an earth-shattering change, but it's one of many nice touches over the previous model.     As for the actual photos, I haven't yet had a lot of time to put it through its paces, but so far the pictures I've taken have been at least as good as the ones I used to get with the SB-800, so we're off to a good start so far. I look forward to using this new flash for years to come.
006145205X|4.0|Whether one agrees with the thesis of exchange as the key to human 'progress' or not, Ridley forces to re-think our perspectives on 'progress' and its evolution.  Ridley positions the book as an exploration of \\"fair, old\\" markets of \\"exchange and specialization\\". To that end, the first few chapters do absolute justice.(Related themes - productivity gains from technology's progress resulting in free time that triggers more innovation - is central to a must-read [[ASIN:1594202532 Cognitive Surplus: Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age]]).  As a 'historical' account, this is an interesting and informative read.      The hypotheses and the supporting evidences, sometime comes across as a force-fit to the central theme.  Initially, Ridley argues he \\"needs to convince that human progress has been a good thing\\" and that there is a \\"constant temptation to moan\\".  Perhaps, Ridley is opportunistically reframing the schools of thoughts on human progress. Very few (other than the fringes) argue that human progress has not been good. They posit that this progress's pace is unsustainable and that we have perhaps reached an inflection point with respect to our impact on the planet.   Such re-framing forces Ridley to gloss over environmental impact (\\"...things have not been better in many parts...except in China...\\").  Really?  Perhaps the impact got shifted to China, India due to the central theme of Ridley - specialization.     Nevertheless, the discussions on self-sufficiency alone is well worth the book.  An entertaining read that forces one to rethink the real causes of human progress - and more importantly its future trajectory.
B003UYUR0G|1.0|Disney should stick to Mickey Mouse, Donald, Pluto ... Uh? Sorry, I forgot, they don't do them anymore. OK, Wall-E, Toy Story, U know, all the great Pixar stuff that I personally enjoy a lot, but this?! Please, can U imagine Disney doing a movie out of games like Gears of War or Assassin's Creed? There won't be enough buckets in this world to pick up my puke! This is a movie that should of been done by the people that gave U Beowulf (2007), 300, Pathfinder, 10,000 BC, Outlander, Gamer, Doom, In the Name of the King, the list is endless!! The Sorcerer's Apprentice? Definitely not in my to buy movies list and I haven's seen it yet! Jake Gyllenhaal is not an action type actor, Gemma Arterton didn't move the ground under my feet, Alfred Molina looked ridiculous, the only well played characters  were Ben Kingsley's and GÃ­sli Ã-rn GarÃ°arsson's (did I managed to write it correctly?), the bad guys.  So don't complain when your 6 year old kid turns 15 and tells you: How could you raise me with this movie?  Stick to the game boys and girls, it's more fun and U really have to struggle in order to win.  Yeah, excellent cgi images but that doesn't make it a good movie.
0316067938|1.0|I was very underwhelmed by this final, anti-climactic ending to the Twilight Saga. So much of story's finale hinges on the threat of violence and then nothing really happens.  There is a literary term for the manner in which the central conflict is resolved and it's called \\"deux ex machina.\\"  And I don't mean that as a compliment.  I cannot recall the last time I read a story that relied so heavily on long passages of exposition, flashbacks, and deux ex machina type endings. Mrs. Meyer is an author who is more about \\"tell\\" rather than \\"show.\\"  There was a chapter title at the end called \\"Contrivances.\\"  How apt. That pretty much says it all for the book as a whole.  What is most surprising is that the people adapting this into a movie actually want to make it into TWO films. This is hardly worthy of that treatment. What's going to happen in part 2? The second movie would be nothing but talking and imaginary fight scenes.
0375842209|5.0|The book arrived within a couple days.  It was well wrapped and was in very good condition.
0156027321|2.0|This book is very well written and Yann Martel proves himself to be an illustrative writer.  Towards the middle of the book, however, I was getting a little bored and the description was too monotonous.  I read the rest of the book by reading the first few sentences of paragraphs until the end, when the whole story came together.  Overall, it was a very gruesome tale and, towards the end when I was really engrossed, very upsetting.  I wouldn't consider myself overly sensitive, and this book just upset me with all the details of killing and bloodshed.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|Just watched this movie last night and absolutely loved it.  If I had a movie to watch like this (well-acted, well-directed, atmospheric, intriguing), well, lets just say I would enjoy those two hours each day very much!
B002ZG997C|4.0|This was a very different kind of movie for Denzel Washington.  Playing a mysterious loner named Eli, Denzel Washington has spent the last 30 years of his life walking west through a post-apocalyptic United States with what could be the last copy of the King James Bible - all because a voice in his head told him to.  He doesn't seem to understand exactly why he is doing this, but sustains the faith to do so anyway.  Along his route on the Highway of Death, he encounters much evil and hopelessness.  Still, he stays true to his mission and keeps going.    Eventually he encounters Gary Oldman, playing a callous town overseer, who will stop at nothing to get the book that Eli carries and reads from every day. The plot soon turns into a good versus evil conflict with a spiritual undertone.  Eli gets the upper hand when he receives help from a young woman (Mila Kunis) who doesn't understand what the world was like before \\"The Flash\\" occurred and changed life forever, but who believes in Eli and wants a better life for herself and her mother.      The ending of this science-fiction film is really what makes it.  It sends a powerful message about life, faith, spirituality, and hope.  If I had one criticism about this movie, it would be that it reminds me too much of the film, \\"The Road,\\" which was out around the same time.  Despite that - and the fact that there is a fair amount of violence - I would recommend this movie as one to watch.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Awsome series.  Totally Hooked. Can't wait to receive Season Two on DVD and greatly looking forward to Season Three starting soon on FX
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I have not read the book, but the friend with whom I watched the movie, has.  She and I were both a little disturbed by the actual reading of some beyond risque excerpts from books in the movie.  I would not recommend this for younger teens, though I tend to be more conservative in what I will allow my children to watch.    Overall, I liked the movie, but it is not likely to be on my re-watch once a quarter list like other Austen movies I enjoy.
0307474712|4.0|First and foremost, I liked that David Nicholls created two characters who were far from perfect, but still likable. The set-up of following one random day a year for 20 years was original and intriguing- makes the reader wonder if there's one day of the year that tends to be more eventful than we realize.<br /><br />Both Emma and Dexter were presented as flawed, yet promising individuals.  It was refreshing to read about relatable characters.<br /><br />I admit that I wish it had ended a bit differently, but then life doesn't always work out in the ways we want it to, does it?
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|This movie looks really good in bluray, and of course the movie is fun to watch.  Pick this movie up if you have a bluray player and want to watch a fun action packed movie.
B000Y9PILI|1.0|This is NOT the original Graham Nash album from 1971 but a new remix of that album that makes the album completely different. It is very upseting by the record company (or Nash) to do this and still have the same cover, it's close to fraud, I was completely fooled. It's upseting and a very sad thing to do, the genuine atmosphere of good art is gone. Especially the lead vocal by Nash is somehow »washed up« and now sounds unnatural and to distinct, apart from the overall sound.   For Your own good, try to get the earlier CD-edition, it's faithful to the Graham Nash original intentions with the Songs For Beginners and it's quite good CD-production, I've compared to the original LP.
B00065F86U|1.0|Come on, Nikon, just supply it with the grip. The asking price is a joke.
B003QCCS36|5.0|From the instant this album starts you get hooked. I've listened to it non-stop since I put it on my iPod. Ray's voice is rich and soulful as usual. And his lyrics are just as good, I've always loved the way he puts things.    I love the mix of country, folk, blues and even a little bit of funk that gets showcased on this album.     Repo Man - my favorite on the album. Quick with a bit of attitude. Easy to move to.    New York City's Killin Me - I admit, my attachment to this song is purely personal. I can relate to it.    Devil's in the Jukebox - Ray closes with another new favorite.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is by far the most amazing show on tv. You really feel for the characters and the mix of suspense, drama and laughter is what makes this show so fun to watch. Too bad it is only available on Showtime.
1416524800|5.0|Exceptional book. If you enjoy Dan Brown's books I highly recommend picking up this book. It should be made into a movie!
B003CR9BYE|5.0|The issuance of CDs of Frank Sinatra \\"from the past\\" and Amazon selling them caught my eye.  I bought two (2) and will buy more.  The quality of the sound is very good and the music \\"smoth.\\"   Thanks
0399156577|5.0|This book was great! It had everything! And the main male charater was just as tough as Fiona! Loved it! I could read it again right now!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is a film that gets better every time you watch it. You grow in your understanding of what is taking place between the characters, and the emotions involved. Anyone who has ever been alone in a city, or in love with someone who is out of reach will appreciate this film, especially as you watch it for the second time. Bill Murray was the perfect choice; viewing the film for the first time is disappointing only because we expect something different from him.
1439181780|5.0|Rhonda Byrne has been a long-time favorite author of mine. Through \\"The Secret,\\" Rhonda has helped me to have an inner confidence in the law of attraction. I've come to believe that what I think about (in the right way) will come into my life.    In \\"The Power,\\" Rhonda takes the law of attraction in another direction and teaches the power of using your emotions to FEEL what you want to have so that what you desire will come quicker. It is a way of engaging the mind and heart and getting them to work together.    I felt \\"The Power\\" was inspirational, because it reminded me of why we have feelings and the different energy that comes from feelings. Not surprisingly, love is the most powerful feeling . . .genuine love can change anything. . . or any situation.    Rhonda teaches how to use the power of love in all aspects of your life, from relationships to money, to health, and more.    I would highly recommend getting this book along with another that I read early this summer and has meant a lot to me. It seems that there is a 3rd dimension to the Law of Attraction. The best way to describe it is \\"Serendipity.\\"      I've been so inspired by [[ASIN:160037493X Serendipitously Rich: How to Get Delightfully, Delectably, Deliciously Rich (or Anything Else You Want) in 7 Ridiculously Easy Steps]] which was written by Madeleine Kay, along with a foreword by Joe Vitale (a star in \\"The Secret\\" movie). This book gives you a really fun and delightful feeling as it moves you positively on a path of change. However, it also gives you some practical steps which are akin to putting the law of attraction into action by teaching how to make decisions based on serendipity.     It is like having a deeper level of faith.  It has made a difference for me. . .it might for you too.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|This is an awesome DVD.  It's spectacular, even if your not a huge Bee Gees fan I think everyone will love.  I play mine all the time, even my daughter loves it!!!  It's a must have for sure.  They dedicate a song to Andy and sing along with a back drop of him sining it also, very hearfelt
0307594777|5.0|I loved the first two books (both paperbacks) of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy. However, the third book was only available in hard cover at too high a price. I want the trilogy as either, a set of three paperbacks or, a set of three hard covers; I don't want to mix and match. I tried to buy a kindle version of the third book because I was anxious to read it but the US publishing cartel would not ship to Canada. I bought the hard cover bundle because of the 50% sale. I've given away my two paperbacks. The third book in the series (a hard cover) was a delight to read; I really enjoyed it. The ending of the book, and the series, suggests that there is much more in the future for Lisbeth Salander; her life is just starting. It's really so sad that Stieg Larsson is no longer with us to add more books to the trillogy (so to speak). Anyway you made the bundle affordable so I bought it. Thanks. - honshirabe
0307341550|3.0|I wasn't all that impressed with this book. It was well written, entertaining somewhat. When I first received the book in the mail, I was surprised at how slim the book was. I thought, well it'll be a quick to-the-point kind of book. I was wrong. It went on and on about trivial issues between characters that had nothing to do with the plot.<br /><br />The abusive relationship between the mother and daughter reminded me a lot of the relationship my mother had with her mother. My grandmother was an alcoholic and a smoker, and it just made her a mean person. Closed off, and cold.<br /><br />I don't understand why so much focus was given to teenage sexual exploits and bitter judgmental old women. I just don't get it.<br /><br />Missouri, second to Indiana, being the most addicted state, and very territorial and unwelcoming to foreigners is all true. I've been a KC resident for six years and still feel like I'm trying to win their trust.
B001P8B8R0|5.0|This is one of my favorite horses of all. I like his coloring and the paint job is very well done and has a smooth look to it, especially where the socks and star are. I love Schleich horses, and this is no exception!
B003AYPMBU|5.0|I saw Priest on this tour just a few days before this video and cd was filmed and they were fantastic. I was excited to have that concert on cd and on video and I am not disappointed. Although the cd is still British Steel, just remastered, with one extra live song, the dvd is beautiful. This band keeps getting better in my mind and I love hearing British Steel songs live that I have not heard live before in 30 years of listening to this band. For the price, this CD and DVD is a great item and will provide great enjoyment when you just need a little JP in the car and on the TV at home.
0385341008|5.0|As previously described,\\"Its description of life in the Channel Island of Guernsey during and soon after World War II will raise readers' interest\\". The book is a VERY simple read...has lots of insight about what went on during/after the war time, but not really written as a History of the events. It is a great book for a middle school/Freshman child/student to be able to understand the characters and still get some meat from the book about the real world horror. It puts a \\"little\\" light on the darkness these people were exposed to, without the dripping gore as we know it's ugly truth.
0596805888|5.0|I bought this book because I was a nerd, but I'm keeping this book in my kitchen because i'm a nerd who needs to get better at cooking. I've previously been a fan of Americas Test Kitchen's similar detailed explanations - this book is similar, but with better science and more character.     Jeff Potter's Cooking for Geeks has given me a clear and well researched new framework to cook in. He goes into details about the affects of temperature, time, and air, on all of the various ingredients you use. The book is a delight to flip open to any page and find yourself immersed in nifty tricks, interviews with net celebrities, and hard core science behind cooking. Not to mention that the recipes are straight forward and pretty good :)    I highly recommend.
B0000CF35G|4.0|you've heard them in stadium music for years, in a few movies, and the guys have been making albums since 1973.  After 25 years, they've  sold more than 200 million albums worldwide, and are among the pioneers of hard rock/classic rock.  This album packs a punch with \\"thunderstruck,\\" \\"Back in Black,\\" \\"You Shook me all night long,\\" \\"hell's Bells,\\" and more!  If you're a classic/hard rock enthusiast or simply an 80s fanatic, this is a must-have for your collection. ...PARENTAL ADVISORY...There are various sexual references.
B003S6T62Q|4.0|Like one of the other review I agree with the statement about it's time that artist start promoting thier artistry in a different format. A lot of people can't see these artist for one reason or another. We hear them on cd or see thier video on television. Watching a concert is far more excitinig then watching a video on television. For the price you are getting a real bargin. I loved the dvd and for those who hasn't got it yet get it before these artists start disappearing. Keep it Live Joe.
B003JTHESA|4.0|Anyone who dislikes this album is certainly welcome to their opinion. But I don't really understand these geezers who keep whining, \\"It's not classic Maiden\\", or \\"Bruce's voice is not so high\\", or \\"They tried something different, how dare they!\\". Relax people. It is 2010, Bruce is over 50 years old, and Maiden's music has been changing since day one. What we all look for in Maiden are great lyrics that are NOT about girls and their asses but tell us interesting and atmospheric stories--and they are here in spades.  What we look for is 'Arry's  galloping bass lines---check.  Some great riffs, time changes, majestic choruses--got 'em!  Blinding Dave Murray solos? Yep!  OK, OK, so the album is too long at 77 minutes, but so are almost ALL rock records in the CD age (there is a reason why albums should be 40 minutes, and it's not just the limitations of vinyl. Few bands have more inspiration than that when it comes to writing). OK, so Bruce at 50 does not sound like Bruce at 20.  So, fine: get the album, and program your iPod to play The Final Frontier, El Dorado, Coming Home, The Alchemist, The Talisman, The Man Who Would Be King, and When the Wild Wind Blows (omitting the weaker Isle of Avalon, Starblind, and Mother of Mercy. . . at least weaker IMHO--you choose your own). You've still got nearly an hour of great new Maiden, and relax, pals, you can still put on Powerslave any old time you want. No need to get the proverbial knickers in a twist.  The Final Frontier is probably not as good as Brave New World, but it is very good, and it's a new Maiden album that you can get for only 9.99. Do so and enjoy.    UPDATE 8/23/10: Having listened for another week or so, I have to amend my review: I would no longer call Isle of Avalon or Mother of Mercy weaker---they are real growers and especially Avalon I love. I still maintain that Starblind is a bit patched together and just doesn't quite flow like the others, but it is still better than 99% of the stuff out there. I thinkFinal Frontier is at least as good as Brave New World, and really quite close to classics like Powerslave or Piece of Mind. It's just longer, more intricate, and takes a while to \\"sink in\\". But when it does, you will not be able to stop listening!  Also, I have come to realize just how much The Alchemist and El Dorado are very reminiscent of the classic early 80s Maiden sound---so it's not quite true that this is all long and complicated. Finally, Coming Home is just an amazingly well-written song that is not really a ballad, in the sense you would use that term. It still is a mid-tempo rocker in feel, but very poignant and just a fantastic example of songwriting. It deserves to be the next single and to chart, it's really fantastic. UP THE IRONS!
B003JTHESA|3.0|I knew this was bound to happen sooner or later with this band, and, as a huge fan, I was hoping that it wouldn't be just yet. But...the time has come. An AVERAGE record.     I can't believe how the fans simply can't admit that the band ran out of ideas and this album just simply ain't that great. I'm a fan too...and a huge one at that, I go see Maiden every single time they are in Southern California. But I am not afraid to say that, compared to \\"Brave New World\\", for example, this album is average at best. Are there any good songs here? Of course. Are there enough of them to call it a great \\"Maiden\\" album? Absolutely not.    After I listened to it three times, there was not a single memorable track on the whole record - which is unheard of for Maiden on any of their previous albums. It should never, under any circumstances, take a band FOUR YEARS to come up with this kind of mediocrity. I can't believe how many people who say they are old \\"Maiden fans\\" are giving this album five stars. Are you serious? Where are you getting this from?    In any case, this record is still better than 99% of all the mainstream garbage that comes out these days, and this band still deserves tremendous amounts of respect. However, I do hope they play as few tracks as possible from this release the next time I see them Live.
B003YOWU1Q|4.0|I like the rock, blues and funk, but most of this album has a country flavor. Not my cup of tea but I appreciate the effort.
B0030Y11QK|5.0|This is a French movie made for a French audience.  As a result, for Americans, it provides a window into another culture which is familiar in some ways, but quite different in others.  Personally, I love movies which transport me in this way.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the movie is visually beautiful, and thus does justice to the beauty of Paris.  But more importantly, the movie uses its distinctively French style and sensibility in order to probe many facets of the human condition in a sensitive, penetrating, and balanced manner, thus taking us on quite a journey of diverse vicarious experiences, thoughts on questions big and small, and a wide spectrum of simple and complex emotions.  In short, the movie gave me a lot to ponder, and I may need to eventually watch it again.<br /><br />At the end of the journey, it's clear that this is by no means a feel-good movie, and my net feeling was closer to poignance than happiness or even ambivalence.  But the movie does also illustrate the possibility and value of savoring, while we can, the positive elements of life (a very French attitude), some of which can be a source of hope, so the movie has an uplifting side as well - just like real life.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone interested in a beautiful, entrancing, and relatively deep movie.
6305609705|3.0|An entertaining war movie to watch, completes with some insanity of the Vietnam war, of the fictitious voyage of Captain Willard's mission to kill the then insane Colonel Kurtz.  If you are willing to stop at the action, then all is insane. But the movie trys to tell something, or at least it cumulates into Colonel Kurtz's revelation of the cause of his insanity: horror.  So horror turns one to insane, if you do not handle it well. The particular incident that did Kurtz in was when the Special Force jumped into some jungle village and administered some polio vacine. Before the troop left they, with Kurtz, witnessed the villagers hacked off the children's small arms into a pile. The sight, kurtz told, was like a bullet into his head, and he was torn and cried.  It certainly was moving, but the story line itself become insane and a horror. Polio inoculation was a job of the WHO, or some doctor and nurse charities, well planed ahead. Special Forces do not carry syringes and vials, nor issue yellow cards, drop in and give shots. It is fair to say, if you are inoculated under a gun by some camouflaged macho, you will also consider hacking that arm off too.  It is still good entertainment with bonus horror and insanity.
B002ZE43Z2|3.0|didn`t think, i would ever say that. this edition is a joke. in the german version you get another complete skull head from a t-600 (like in the 6-disc edition) !!! and not just a face
9889979942|5.0|China: Portrait of a People by Tom Carter was purchased by my wife after her trip to China. While she was there she took many pictures and even kept a little journal. She shared these with me when she returned but felt that she wanted to show me more. That is when she found this book on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  The description fit what she was looking for. There are lots of pictures of the different regions, peoples and aspects of the country with brief descriptions for each section.  You can really get a feel for the country without a lot of reading.  We ended up loving it so much that we often give copies as gifts to people.      The pictures are truly amazing and I really like the descriptions of each of the provinces that the author visited. Actually I think he went to all of the provinces and that in itself is pretty cool. I think someone mentioned somewhere that he was the first American to do that but I am not sure.    This book is a must have for anyone that has been to China, is going to China, or quite frankly has any interest in China at all.  The photography really captures the essence of the Chinese culture while the descriptive narrations compare and contrast the differences between the vast and numerous regions. In short, I really like the book and would highly recommend it.  Hope that helps.
B003KUSUG8|2.0|Not Em's greatest work, but i still enjoyed quite a bit of songs. But whoever did the recording on this needs to be gunned down. If you have remotely decent headphones/speakers ,you will instantly see the errors in majority of the songs.    I'm giving a 2 solely because of this, other wise my score would've been 3 or 4.
B003183UCI|4.0|When you install the batteries it requires the use of a small phillips head screwdriver... So you need a regular screwdriver to make your Sonic Screwdriver work. (And while I was doing this, I actually was thinking to myself, \\"Hmmm, this really could be more sonic!\\")<br /><br />I've had this thing for about a year now, I use the regular pen nib quite often and it's currently not showing signs of running out of ink. The nib with the UV ink, unfortunately was lost.<br /><br />That is the biggest issue I have with the item. The instruction pamphlet that comes with it says that you can order replacement nibs from customer service. You can not currently just order replacement nibs from Amazon, nor are they currently listed in the \\"Spare Parts\\" section of the Character-Online customer service website. (Though there are spare Dalek parts which is kind of awesome.) You have to call the company's customer service department which is in the UK. So unless you want to call long distance and pay shipping from the UK for pen nibs? Do not loose them. (This may change, I hope it does.)<br /><br />Onto the good stuff!<br /><br />I really love owning this thing. A few days ago I had a blackout at night and (due to a recent move) I couldn't find my flashlight, but I was using this thing to make some notes. So I used it to find my keys and my wallet to go out and buy a proper flashlight and some candles. Doing that was more fun then I should probably admit in a public forum. Secondly, the UV ink is tangentially educational. Your child likes Doctor Who, you get them this pen, they write secret messages on the psychic paper and say \\"Cool! How does that work?\\" They then become interested in what UV light is, learn all sorts interesting stuff about wavelengths and \\"Yay! Science if fun!\\"<br /><br />If you're a cosplayer through, that's not really your concern. From close up and far away it looks good, it has the right moving parts, lights up and makes the noise. It comes with batteries. I don't know what more you could ask for.<br /><br />Just don't misplace the pen nibs.Just don't misplace the pen nibs.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I remember watching Daria when i was younger and i loved the show. Now i have this collection and can not wait to watch the whole thing all over again!!! I have already watched season 1 and 2 and i must say the quality is excellent!!
B002ZG999U|4.0|I mean, this is staple fare, the guy flick concocted from explosives, diesel fuel, and testosterone, the commodity that studios keep churning out because they keep making money. Get your checklist ready, this has it all: a way-cool chase scene, a bring-it-down-around-their-ears ending, badguy foot soldiers who die like flies, a guy who hits girls getting the tar whupped out of him, some wildly improbable but really big gun, and a big man-to-man mano-a-mano fight scene between the two boss badazzes. Throw in the noble loneliness of the tough-but-honest mercenary (close cousin to the prostitute with a heart of gold), a saveable babe, and lots of things exploding as soon as they catch fire - well, youd didn't come here for plausibility. This stands as yet another towering tribute to Utter Manliness and to those select few who sacrifice themselves on its altar, and have a blast doing it. Not that they'd actually ever confess to something as unmanly as having big fun with big-boy toys.<br /><br />A month from now, even the finest memory will have trouble distinguishing this from others of its genre. That's OK. This is all about doing the right thing here and now, so watch it here and now.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

Martin \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" calendar.  I am a fan of Ted Nasmith's work, particularly his illustrations for Tolkien's \\"Silmarillion,\\" and the artwork in this calendar is equally stunning.  The detail in the paintings is exquisite. There is one castle for each month plus a large gatefold. If you are a fan of Nasmith's, Martin's, or both, I highly recommend this calendar.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I have actually stopped watching any TV since the season finale aired. Nothing makes me want to make time for a show. The end.<br /><br />— UPDATE —<br />Above was my initial review. I figured I'd elaborate a little more.<br /><br />This is the entire LOST series in a gorgeous Blu-ray set. The main box is made of a sturdy cardboard material. All the content is contained in a three-dimensional trapezoid brick shape. It looks like something that could exist in the LOST universe.<br /><br />Lift the brick cover up and you'll see a very cool dimensional map of The Island. From here, you are presented with three main compartments. The top and bottoms have special items: a black and white pebble game (from the show), a black light, an ankh, and a letter. The middle section houses a booklet that serves as an episode guide. Below that are six booklets that store all six seasons of the series.<br /><br />— A BOX WITH A SECRET —<br />There is one last secret. All the items that I just mentioned are given to you for a reason. Figure out why you have them, and how to use them, and you'll discover and be rewarded with a bonus item.<br /><br />— SUMMARY —<br />This Blu-ray set is great and tops all the individual season sets that came before it. Opening this up and exploring the contents feels like you've uncovered a box of secrets, just like in the show. Recommended.
B001Q8FRVC|5.0|I have always felt that very few albums since the 70s have been complete albums, you know, one that you could listen to all the way through without having that never-ending urge to press the skip button to get to one of the 2 or 3 tracks on the album actually worth listening to.  This album is one of those albums, at least for me it is.  I absolutely love this album and can not say it enough.  I have had the CD version of it since the mid 90s and just recently picked up the vinyl remastered copy.  All tracks on the album to me are more than just listenable, I do not feel like any of them were just thrown on the album as \\"filler\\", you know, tracks to fill out the rest of the space between the 2 singles that are actually decent.      While I stress the entire album as a whole is great, that is not to say that some tracks don't stand out from the others.  My personal favorite songs on this album are as follows: nitro (youth energy) - very aggressive, driving rhythm;  gotta get away - I love the harmonies on the choruses and the percussive beat on the verses; come out and play - one of two radio staples for the band, favorite part is the middle eastern sounding main lead/riff; self esteem - the second track that received significant radio airplay, I love the lyrics, quite comical in a sense, and the simplicity of the song, even slower it is excellent, not the one - love the lyrics, the attitude to the song, the drive to the song is excellent; and finally smash - my personal favorite song on the album, I love the riffs to this album, the lyrics, the message of the song, pretty much a great song to end on only since, as said already in this review, the entire album is a must listen, elsewise this great of a track at the end might be missed by many casual listeners.    The vinyl edition is pressed on a translucent orange vinyl disc and features some additional artwork on the album sleeve that was not in the original edition CD booklet.  Also, the remastered vinyl comes with a code to download mp3 versions of every song on the album for free, not something I needed in for this album, but it is definitely awesome to receive, I really appreciate seeing that paying extra for the analog recording is rewarded.  Awesome.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I can't believe all the negative comments on here about this album; 1 star?  Really?  To my ears, it is vintage Depeche Mode and that is a good thing.  It has a retro kind of feel while still managing to be current.  Dave's voice is sounding as good as it ever did (one of the best voices in popular music) and Martin also does a great job with his vocals and with his songwriting.  \\"Wrong\\" is one of the best singles from Depeche Mode ever and was written by Martin.  I love the lyric, and the vibe of that song. \\"In Chains\\" has a very sexy, slinky sound that I personally would like to hear more of. I also love Miles Away/The Truth is which was written by Dave and features that sexy wonderful voice of his with first rate harmony from Martin.  Fragile Ternsion and Corrupt are also great. \\"Jezebel\\" is a bit slow, but the vocal is a 10/10.  \\"Come Back\\" with it's clanging synths really sounds very retro to me.  One of the reasons that I love it. I have been a fan of DM since the beginning but I have not loved everything they have ever done.  I think this would be true for any band that has been around for as long as DM have. However, this album is in my top 3 favorite Depeche Mode albums. I find myself listening to it at least once a week since I have purchased it.  I bought the digital version and then purchased the CD for the car.  I don't do that for too many albums.  For me, this is one of the best albums of year 2009
006091307X|2.0|This is the kind of book I imagine I would write were I inclined to that profession:  1)short; 2) playfully literate (oh, I'm literate, baby!); 3) obscure, as if I'm writing to myself and don't give a toss what you think; and 4) not really about anything, since I have nothing to say!<br /><br />That fourth reason there is why I don't try my hand at writing.  You heard me right:  I have no wisdom, no insights, nothing coherent to say about life, the human condition, or the human heart.  Knowing this, I have the grace to not even attempt to enter the contest.<br /><br />But I guess Pynchon didn't scruple.  I mean, Oedipa Mass's chasing down the enigmatic Trystero organization -- what does it amount to?  What does it tell us about ourselves?  Or the world?<br /><br />When I compare this with even one of Dickens's lesser outings, I conclude that Pynchon is using an abstruse style to smokescreen the fact that, when you get right down to it, he has nothing to say about \\"the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,\\" in the words of another difficult writer -- though one whose problematic narrative style holds rich rewards for those patient enough to negotiate it.
B0034G4OWW|3.0|According to Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and every site with a Critics' avg. score, \\"Furry Vengeance\\" is the lowest point in Brendon Fraser's career, and regressed his status to the level of \\"Encino Man\\".  It's true that he wasn't [[ASIN:B001NPD9JA doing]] [[ASIN:B002ZG97J2 well]] as of recent, but this is the movie that will severely damage his reputation?  For some people, it probably is, and this movie certainly acquires a particular taste.  To prove a point, here are some of the movie antics done by the woodland creatures:<br /><br />- a raccoon and a skunk hotwiring and driving an SUV<br />- a weasel building a Rude Goldberg-esque trap to roll a large rock on an unsuspecting vehicle<br />- multiple skunks inexplicably hiding in the same SUV so they can surprise the victim and blow their gasket on him<br />- the same raccoon pulling a plug on an active treadmill while someone's using it, where he will trip and hit a wall<br />- a bear pushing around a porta-potty with a man inside (and inexplicably ripped the guy's pants off), and somehow moved the porta-potty on top of a tree)<br /><br />If those antics made you slap your hands to your face (is that what the cool kids call a 'facepalm'?), then stop reading this review, ignore this movie, huddle up in your nice blanket in front of the TV and watch the surprisingly-good-[[ASIN:B00005JNX0 by]]-[[ASIN:B0006JMLRK Dreamworks]]-[[ASIN:B000UVKGPI standards]] \\"Over The Hedge\\" instead.<br /><br />Here's the tale of the furry fiasco. Dan Sanders (Fraser) relocated his wife (Brooke Shields) and angsty teen to a wilderness location to do some construction work for new housing.  Later, he was ordered by his Asian boss with an American name, Mr. Lyman (Ken Jeong), to destroy a large forest so the company will build a large suburbia.  That posed a serious threat to the habitable beings of the forest who realized this plan, and so all the animals brought FURious malevolence against Dan; cue the hilarity.  Oh, and the film has something to do with saving the forest, preserving the wildlife, and whatever.  I don't care if people are barking on rescuing trees, I'm here to find entertainment.<br /><br />The film's humor depended entirely on two things: pratfalls and people yelling (Dan Sanders: \\"MILEY CIRUS!\\"). Fortunately for this film, I'm a fan of LOUD NOISES, but while the absurd pratfalls get the job done, they did overstayed their welcome after a while. There's also the recurring joke that Dan is the only character who knows that he's being terrorized by territorial furries, and everyone thinks he's bonkers. I got along with this joke at first, but soon I had to wonder if the other characters were simply in denial. At one scene, there's a crow that keeps knocking on Dan's window and he keeps hearing, but his wife must've have her ears blocked if she couldn't hear such an obviously loud noise. The previously-mentioned porta-potty on top of the tree scene was even more baffling, as his family and his constructing crew saw just that; they still don't believe him, but they should at least think of a possibility that there might be shenanigans involved.<br /><br />The cast obviously go to the Looney Tunes school of acting for this movie. Brendon Fraser goes into his usual Fraser-mode, acting nervous and overly-pitchy for most of his lines; whether you find that charming or annoying is up to you. The other cast just goes along with the over-acting camaraderie. I'm not sure what to think of Jeong's performance; sometimes, he bickers in a fake superficial Asian language and I don't know if that's suppose to be insulting.  Probably not, since he has the habit in doing this since \\"Knocked Up\\".<br /><br />But after all is said and done, I have to admit I actually had a good time with \\"Furry Vengeance\\".  Yes, this film used the bare basics of comedy, and the vengeance aspect does go on way too long for something so simple like a cry for help, not to mention how insipid the whole arrangement is. But because of how utterly absurd the animals acted, and how over-the-top the acting is, the accumulated ridiculousness made the film mildly-enjoyable.  I did glee for some of the antics, and I had a chuckle for one unpredictable scene.  It had some amusing characters like the security guy played by Toby Hoss, and at one point, he was as close to acting like Artie that a [[ASIN:B0007Y08LA \\"Pete & Pete\\"]] fan like myself has gotten in a long time.  The animals were unrealistic in everything they do and expressed, but they never bothered me, except for the one stupid scene with the animals partying in Dan's house and a porcupine is scratching the record like a DJ; however, that turned out to be a dream sequence, so I let that slide.<br /><br />The film could've been better as a cartoon than live-action, but for what it is, I don't hate it.  And I don't see how families are going to like this less than I do, and believe me, there are animal films I hated [[ASIN:B0002PYSUQ more]] [[ASIN:B00008YRU0 than]] [[ASIN:B00003CXJA this]].

1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone is a teenager (with autism/Asperger's) who lives with his single dad.  His idiosyncratic life, ruled by structure and math(s), continues until he discovers death of his neighbor's dog, Wellington.  Encouraged by his teacher to write a story, he begins to investigate the dog's death.<br />NOTE: Listened to audiobook.<br /><br />I Liked:<br />From the first words, I was hooked.  The first person viewpoint is used phenomenally well.  I felt I was inside Christopher's head, thinking his thoughts, feeling his feelings; and I grew to understand his frustration with society, how he perceived society, and his fascination with numbers and space.  Christopher literally lept from the pages to me, and I connected with him on a deep level.  So kudos to Haddon, for writing such a moving character!<br />I have little knowledge of autism/Asperger's, but from what I read, Christopher seems very realistic.  What I loved most, though, was despite his autism, he did have feelings, he was scared, excited, overwhelmed, and happy.  Too often, we see these stereotyped portrayals of autistic children, and it's disturbing.  Again, I don't have a lot of knowledge of the subject, so maybe I was off, but I think that the goal, to humanize those with autism, was accomplished.<br />Haddon also paints some realistic people around Christopher, from his teacher (don't know how to spell her name!), to his mother, to his father, to his neighbors, and so on.  I loved his father's sacrificial nature, his mother's selfishness (or was she selfish??), the guiding help of the teacher, and so on.<br />Based on the title, you would think the book is merely a mystery, and while there is a mystery that instigates it, it is far more than a mystery.  It's about a boy learning of his parents.  I won't spoil it (though maybe it's not a spoiler?), but the end outcome really made me think about the main characters and was so-and-so REALLY \\"bad\\" and was so-and-so justified for doing this and so on.<br /><br />I Didn't Like:<br />There is not much to dislike about this book.  However, I was a tad confused at one point.  Basically, the dog is killed, flashback, and then modern day.  By that point, I had forgotten that the mother wasn't living anymore, so I was confused.  This was easy to clear up.<br /><br />Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:<br />Sh**, f-bombs, and at least one instance of the c-word.  All (to my knowledge) are spoken by adults or related from Christopher as spoken by adults.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I borrowed this audiobook; I say this because, now that I've listened to it, I am going to buy a copy of this book for myself!!  Yes, this book is that good!  I really enjoyed the insightful look into Christopher and his moving journey into investigating.  I highly recommend.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B002JCSWV6|3.0|Can a movie be both enjoyable and mired with deficiencies? \\"Invictus\\" proves the answer is a hearty yes.<br /><br />On the positive side Matt Damon gives a very restrained performance while Morgan Freeman is convincing and inspirational as Nelson Mandela. The rugby action scenes were breathtaking, as were the natural surroundings/background of the South African scenery. Some of the most powerful moments in the movie came when no one was talking or acting -- when the slums of the outlying townships and confines of Robben Island prison were shown.<br /><br />That said, the movie is fairly one dimensional. It's a story about a President looking to unify a populace, and the rugby team he uses to achieve that goal. Aside from Damon's Francois Pienaar the viewer gets to know one other player on the team. Mandela's family is mentioned numerous times and is seemingly plays an important role in his decision-making, but there is only one scene where we see that side of him (and it seems like there was no good reason to keep the scene in the movie).<br /><br />A sense of pacing is also lacking. As the movie opens it's about a year to the World Cup and the Springboks are getting smoked by England in a match. The next thing we know the team is having a couple practices (under a new coach that is never introduced), a coaching clinic in one of the townships and then all of a sudden it's the World Cup championship. Of course it's not feasible to show everything leading up to that final match, but more of the in between would have been nice.<br /><br />It also would have been nice to see how the general population reacts to the team's quest for the Cup. We see a growing bond between Mandela's security men over the game of rugby, but nothing of what was transpiring among people outside the inner circle of the government and the rugby team itself. The movie is supposed to show how rugby and the Springboks' run in the World Cup helped heal the wounds of apartheid, but that is seldom, if ever, shown.<br /><br />All said, a very enjoyable movie, but one with its share of flaws.ble movie, but one with its share of flaws.

0142410322|1.0|We recently finished \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" as a readaloud to our five year old daughter. What a cruel disappointment to read this book. By chapter three, we were all bored. And as a parent, I thought the characters were unusually mean as they spoke to each other. By chapter four, the \\"President\\" was racially stereotyping other cultures. As the parent of a Chinese child, I couldn't even bring myself to read aloud the Chinese Prime Minister's dialogue (for example: \\"Gleetings, honorable Mr. Plesident\\" and \\"Excuse pleese, Mr. Plesident. You make big mistake.\\"     Needless to say, we didn't finish chapter four, and we won't be finishing the book.
B0001XLY8S|2.0|Stark and depressing, yet somehow also sappy and stereotypical, this film fails on numerous fronts despite an all-star cast and a reasonably compelling story that combines a Civil War epic with the gunslinging and emotional bleakness of a Western. There are just too many stereotypes and storybook leaps here. The man is a perfect paragon of honor while simultaneously portraying a harlequin romance combination of the strong silent type and the bad boy. And the waiting Nicole Kidman tries to bridge incredible faith with a peculiar madness, but it doesn't work and she's just a stereotpyed Southern Belle in lace. The bad guys are all cliches in black hats as well. Renee Zellweger's character is the one bit of promise, the one point of interest here, a strong woman and peppy eccentric, and as the musicians appear on the scene, the film pricks up for a moment. But then the bad guys show up and it disappears back down the hackneyed hole of predictability and emotionl vacuity. And what is this, a sex scene where the two nearly emotionally destroyed, putative virgins sport porno-style shaved bodies? And what is this, he dies the next day slaying the bad guys? But they conceived a child? No. Wow. Just too much by half.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|We have here stark and trenchant exploration of current issues without preaching: police corruption, the death penalty, the nature of evil. But the film has to overcome its somewhat trite 20s-era staging (everything and everyone looks so clean in those streetcars!). Jolie is surprisingly good, though not quite brilliant, as the worried working mother who learns to take on the system. Malkovitch offers fascinating nuance as the crusading church leader and moral hero. And Jason Butler Harner provides the right niceness on top of his despicable evil; together they make it riveting right up until his theatrically brilliant hanging at San Quentin.

0307454541|2.0|This book is not nearly as good as the hype would indicate. The premise is certainly  intriguing and the Lisbeth character is somewhat interesting, but the book's phenomenal success is unwarranted. I put this book down several times, only to pick it up later - thinking I must be missing something. Perhaps I would break through some barrier 50 pages further and discover the source of all the critical and popular acclaim. Did not happen. I am no writer but it is apparent the book desperately needs some editing. There are a lot of bad books out there - I just haven't figured out why this one became an international bestseller.

I felt \\"icky\\" through parts of it, I felt uncomfortable...but I never wanted to stop reading...and that's a sign of good writing to me....she pulled me so far into the story, I felt like I was in it.  A lot of mysteries are good for keeping you intrigued and this one did that, but going deeper than most. The author really developed her characters and thoroughly researched the subject matter and her homework showed.  I also read her second book \\"Dark Places\\", which is completely different in some ways but the style, depth and dark tone were still there.  It was equally as good as \\"Sharp Objects\\" in a different way.  I'm so so pleased to have found this author.  Her books are extremely satisfying.
0312370849|5.0|Because of my own to-be-published memoir on the subject (\\"Out of Prague: A Memoir of Survival, Denial, and Triumph\\"), I try to read any and all books on this subject -- fiction and nonfiction. Some are good, some are fair, others are outstanding. Taking its place at or near the top of the latter group is \\"Sarah's Key\\" by Tatiana de Rosnay. It is a fictional account of a young girl's separation from her parents, following a real event: the round-up of thousands of French Jews and their children -- not by Germans, but by French police. Ms.de Rosnay teaches us about this shameful and little-known crime by skillfully interweaving two story lines -- those of Sarah, the Jewish girl who holds a terrible secret and Julia, an American journalist, who uncovers the secret. The story is powerful and compelling. At the same time, it is so terrifying that -- on many occasions -- I wanted to stop reading. But, I couldn't. I am grateful to St. Martin's Press, and its Griffin imprint, for publishing one of the finest books in this genre. Go out and buy this book. It will make you cry, but you will never forget it.

B002RWKSII|5.0|Just got my pre-ordered copy of \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\\" in the mail. This is a release I have been looking forward to with great anticipation.  I figured that given the significance of this undertaking and the potential criticism that it might induce the album was either going to fall flat on its face or be simply sensational. I spent the better part of last evening listening to this disc and I am very pleased to report that Brian Wilson has done it again.  \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\\" succeeds on just about every level.  It is an album that is at once extremely interesting to listen to and highly enjoyable as well.<br /><br />Critics are already touting \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\\" as one of the year's best releases. I couldn't agree more. New York Magazine says \\"Wilson has created gorgeous and unexpected arrangements that strip away decades of familiarity.\\"  Although this disc is relatively short by today's standards (about 40 minutes) there are several highlights worth mentioning. \\"Summertime\\" is one of the greatest tunes ever penned and Brian Wilson does Gershwin proud and makes this venerable favorite all his own.  I was particularly taken by Wilson's instrumental version of \\"I Got Plenty O' Nothing\\". This one will get your toes tappin' lickety split. Meanwhile, experience Brian's take on other Gershwin favorites like \\"It Ain't Necessarily So\\", \\"I Got Rhythm\\" and \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\".  Outstanding!  And sample Brian Wilson's fine arrangement of \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\".  As far as I am concerned that one ranks right near the top of the list of tunes in the Great American Songbook.  Now what makes this project so unique is that with the permission of the Gershwin family Brian Wilson was able to complete two unfinished Gershwin tunes. The results were simply sensational.  Check out \\"The Like In I Love You\\" and \\"Nothing But Love\\" and see if you agree.<br /><br />Over the years I have always been a sucker for great harmony and \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\\" certainly does not disappoint.  This is an outstanding recording and if the initial reviews on Amazon and in other media are any indication Brian Wilson just might have a major hit on his hands.  He certainly deserves it.  This was an extremely well thought out and flawlessly executed project.  Very highly recommended!Gershwin\\" certainly does not disappoint.

B00009RAJJ|3.0|Originally released on October 12, 1979 as a $16.98 double vinyl LP, \\"Tusk\\" was released as a \\"2 record set on 1 specially-priced disc\\" on October 25, 1990. Recorded primarily by Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut at The Village Recorders in West LA, it was one of the earlier rock albums to be digitally mixed down. It is a very nice sounding LP mastered by Ken Perry. It sounded even better when released on CD with remastering for CD by Ken Caillat. Crisp, quiet and dynamic.<br /><br />On March 23, 2004, Warner Bros. released \\"Tusk\\" remastered and with a second CD containing bonus material at $24.98. Being a fan of the album and loving to hear alternate takes, etc., I was, as before, the first on the block to buy the new version.<br /><br />The sound is not as good and the extra material is just ok. This \\"Deluxe Edition\\" was remastered by Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch at Digiprep. The sound is noticeably louder (about 5dB) than the original CD. It is also not nearly as crisp in the highs, tight in the lows, or dynamic in range as the 1990 CD. It sounds compressed and re-eq'd. The loudest peak on the the 1990 CD is found in \\"The Ledge\\". The loudest peak on the 2004 disc is found in \\"Sisters of the Moon\\". The practice of increasing the loudness and reducing the dynamic range is a very common one these days I'm sorry to say. Especially silly to do when you are using a medium which offers more range than previously available for home use. But the public insists that louder sounds better! So much for preservation of artistic intent. When the recording industry crushes dynamics, it crushes emotion.<br /><br />The second disc contains previously unreleased versions of nearly all 20 original tracks. These 21 tracks are laid down using the same running order as \\"Tusk\\", with the exceptions of shuffling in three different versions of \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\", and two new songs, \\"Kiss and Run\\" and the Beach Boys \\"Farmer's Daughter\\", and the single versions of \\"Think About Me\\" and \\"Sisters of the Moon\\". Except for the last two, all these songs are either \\"demos, roughs, or outakes\\". They are not that interesting, and not \\"must have\\" tracks.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This BBC costume drama is like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with guts and muscle. It tells the story of Margaret Hale, strong-minded daughter of a village vicar and John Thornton, tough northern mill owner. Hale's father refuses to sign a pledge of Church loyalty and is forced to leave his post. His family is uprooted from the beautiful countryside of the south of England, where life meanders on as it always has, to the tough, grimy, polluted northern mill town of Milton where Mr. Thornton and other masters are busy running the engine of the Industrial Revolution.<br /><br />The author, Mrs Gaskell, who herself lived in both North and South, is unblinking in chronicling the hardship and cruelty of the \\"dark Satanic mills\\" including the degradations of child labor, dangerous machines, excessive hours, low wages and air polluted with cotton that coats the workers' lungs and sends them to early graves. She is remarkably fair mediating between workers trying to form a union that will protect some of their rights and ensure a fair wage and the owners engaged in cut-throat competition.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful, especially by the two principals who have real chemistry. There is a kind of Pride and Prejudice about their affair, which begins as in Austen with a botched proposal and proceeds through a process in which they learn to respect and then to love one another. The secondary roles are also great, especially the redoubtable Sinead Cusack as Thornton's no-nonsense mother. There are moments of excessive melodrama and some of the plotting is clumsy but in general this is superior entertainment and highly recommended.

B002ZG980U|5.0|`Inception' is a hard movie to judge.  Basically, it is a mind-bender, and as such should be judged by two criteria:  How good of a mind-bender is it? And, How much does it create a  realm of its own with phenomena and rules of causality that work consistently?    In my mind `Inception,' despite some derivative elements, is an inventive movie that provides mind-enveloping reactions well after the viewing is over.  Much like Lynch's `Inland Empire' before it, the movie coalesces well into one's imagination and lingers in the mind for days to come.     Being brief with the story is difficult, and I'm sure by now you've probably digested a great deal of material elsewhere.  Washed up on an Asian seashore, American businessman, Cobb (Di Caprio) meets with an elderly leader to obtain a contract and  defeat his enemies.   To accomplish this, he offers to perform an \\"extraction,\\" a means of obtaining secrets from a person`s subconscious during one's dream life.  In the midst of their negotiations, an entire village riots and takes over the building where they meet, and Cobb and his sidekick, Arthur, (Gordon-Levitt) fight and flee to save their lives....    In this beginning scene the lines are partially drawn between dreams and awakening, but the surrealistic landscape also provides Nolan ample opportunities to provide his trademark action-adventure for his science fiction saga.     Cobb later meets an old professor (Caine) who sagely links him to a prodigy student, Ariadne, (Page) who can assist him with his next assignment and help straighten out his perspective and proper use of inceptions, or the use of subliminal persuasion, participating in another's subconscious perceptions and manipulating them during their dreams.  In their first assignment together, he plans to have a rich man's son and heir, Robert Fischer (Murphy) change his mind about his father's will, so he will be able to either obtain or sabotage his inheritance.    There are dreams, and there are dreams within dreams, and one of Cobb's plans is to have three levels of dreaming going on at once to have the most persuasive power on Fisher.     Intertwined are revelations from Cobb's subconscious, revealed with Ariadne, who joins him on his subliminal journey and witnesses some of his life-changing events with his wife (Cotillard).  In a partial revelation, Cobb admits he included his wife in some of his dream work with complications that has created strife in their relationship.            As you might imagine, problems develop that make the operation work less neatly and easily as planned, so discerning what level of dreaming and what level of reality are taking place also becomes blurred.  The exposition and details are laid out more concretely than Lynch's worlds, but the caveats others have placed about paying attention are well founded.       Besides the mood of mind-benders like Lynch's `Mulholland Drive,' Nolan has borrowed and alchemized elements from inventive movies like the truly excellent Japanese anime' adventure `Paprika' and movies like 'The Cell,' but the results are truly new and effective.      I have to admit my biases.   I love mind-benders, and it's no accident that Christopher Nolan and David Lynch are at the top of my list of favorite directors.  This creates a problem because if you love mind-benders as a rule, it is sometimes difficult to separate effective works from those that don't work as well.      I was originally wavering between four and five stars for this film based on the ending.  I'll give no details for that, but, I've decided, like 'Inland Empire' before it, `Inception' may seem abrupt, but its import as a surrealistic experience is nearly as mind-altering.  'Inception' deserves attention, awards, multiple viewings, and the time needed for a truly rewarding film experience.  If you love Lynch's work, you will probably also love 'Inception,' but one could concede this movie isn`t as effective at playing with your noodle. On the other hand, if you find Lynch's films to be frustrating or too abstract, then Nolan's 'Inception' may give you a more satisfying sense of concreteness and closure overall.     (Tom Berenger and Ken Watanabe join an outstanding cast for a taut movie experience.)     (Some loose ends of `Inception' have been tightened from information from imdb.)

159668139X|5.0|Sorry I've taken so long to write this review. I received the book and have been reading and playing with it since. I am very very happy with my purchase. Delivery was promt, especially for overseas shipping.I was kept well informed throughout the process and felt pleased with my decision to buy online from start to finish. I mention this because this is my first ever time purchasing online and overseas. Yes I know this is 2010 but some of us take a little longer to come out of the cave than others. Anyway thanks again and I would recommend this way of doing business to any first timers like myself.

B002ZG997C|2.0|\\"The Book of Eli\\" has many post-apocalyptical antecedents, including \\"Mad Max\\" and \\"The Postman,\\" and not surprisingly there are many similarities among these movies.  The Hughes brothers' vision is far more bleak and at the same time far more limited.  After a nuclear holocaust, chaos in the form of cannibalism and banditry descend upon the earth, and that's just not an issue for Eli (Denzel Washington), a \\"walker\\" who is \\"traveling West\\" in order to deliver the world's last Bible to a sanctuary.  In his way is a would-be messiah (played by a Dracula-like Gary Oldman) and very bad lighting.  The plot is very messy, and the post-apocalyptical world happens to be even more absurd than the world we live in now.  The ending is bathetic, and really does draw on for much too long (believe it or not, it's even more of a drawn out ending than that of \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\"  The movie also stars Denzel Washington so it's bound to be self-righteous, and this movie most certainly is.
0385504225|2.0|I listened to almost all of the book on cd.  Thank goodness the action was so slow I could leave the room, take a phone call, do chores, etc and not really miss any action.  I must admit after 16+ hours of listening to repeat after repeat of the same old clap trap I put it back in the folder on disc 14.    How stupid does Brown think his average reader to be?  My goodness, I've not experienced such repetition since - \\"Run, Spot, Run\\".  On the topic of the author assuming his readers to be of below average IQ, who but a blind person would not see through the make up on the villain?    Was the author getting paid by  the word and he lost his thesaurus so he had to keep repeating the same phrases?  Perhaps it was revealed on one of my ventures out of the room but what was the purpose of hacking the code?  What was the importance, if any, of the code in the CIA statue?  Why did they even need Langdon if Peter knew all?  Other than money, why did the author even bother writing such a lame book?    If you are thinking about reading this book or listening to it on cd I would recommend your local library or the vast number of used copies available.  I would not want to put any money in the author's pocket for such a lame work.  The only bright spot - in today's reading market many more people are reading books on Kindle so at least fewer trees are being destroyed to print books like this.
B000093FLA|5.0|I have a bit of a thing for British comedies.  I enjoy various British accents and I have come to learn much of their slang, as well as to get used to their unique brand of humor.  Consequently, I loved this film Snatch.<br /><br />I watched Snatch before Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, so I was unaware that Guy Ritchie basically just lazily reused the same concept from that prior film and threw in a couple of variables to make it seem different.  Now that I know, I can't say I honestly care.  Both films are good in their own right, but I think I prefer Snatch.  The \\"formula\\" of profane, heavily accented British thugs bantering with each other, and multiple plot-lines criss-crossing into total mayhem at the film's climax, is one that I have no problem seeing twice.<br /><br />Snatch is a very clever movie.  Guy Ritchie came up with some great ideas on how to make the seemingly separate stories work together in perfect harmony, and managed to kill off nearly all the characters in one way or another, without making the viewer feel too sad about the losses.  The story, despite being rather absurd, is still fairly plausible, considering the ruthlessness of those involved.  Meanwhile, there is some side-splitting humor to be found, considerably more-so than in Lock, Stock... which focused more on dark, subtle comments.  My favorite part is the introduction to Tyrone, the \\"getaway driver,\\" as he attempts to squeeze himself into a Rover SD1 that is too small for him and then, after Sol and Vinnie discuss the merits of a SPAS-12 shotgun, backs into a van because \\"I didn't see it there.\\"  I crack up laughing every time I watch that scene.<br /><br />I also appreciated the film-making at work in Snatch.  The dark, gritty, overprocessed look really suits the dingy back alley settings of an overcast, seedy part of London and the insides of boxing rings.  The various slow-motion and unique angle shots contribute greatly to the feel of the film; the slow-motion shot of Brad Pitt/Mickey seeming to go down for good while boxing, and the waist-level upward shots of Brick Top's henchmen walking down the dimly lit, flickering halls really added a lot, in my opinion.  The soundtrack, as well, is amusing, fitting, and well-timed.  One of my favorite musical parts is the use of Mirwais' \\"Disco Science\\" as Tyrone and the hare are simultaneously being run down by gangster thugs and gypsy hunting dogs, respectively.<br /><br />Overall, Snatch is a great movie, but don't expect to catch it all the first time unless you are really good at reading subtitles and seeing little visual details.  It's a movie that will benefit from several viewings, until you can catch all the vagaries of British slang and mumbling.  Whether or not Guy Ritchie blatantly recycled his \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\" formula to make this film doesn't matter (and he definitely DID), because it is a gem in its own right (no pun intended....)<br /><br />Enjoy it!go down for good while boxing, and the waist-level upward shots of Brick Top's henchmen walking down the dimly lit, flickering halls really added a lot, in my opinion.

B00006LLNV|5.0|This cd is so passionate and the musicianship spot on. Its amazing how the music seems to fit so well with Fridas life.  I know really nothing about Hispanic musicians and am happy to say after reading the liner notes I will look into other musicians on this cd. Buy this cd you will not be dissapointed !
6304602944|4.0|If you just get the movie (this price can't be beat) to find out what FUBAR means, you can also see one of the best ODD Couples (Stallone + Russell) since Oscar and Felix.  My 4 star rating is not for  OSCAR nominating stuff it is for pure entertainment value; if I WERE to do so, I would either get real 4 star movies or another life. Besides TANGO (Stallone) and CASH (Russell), there is Teri Hatcher as the Damsel in Distress and Jack Palance as the Villain!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Lost: The Complete Epic...started with the sounds of the ocean and pandemonium and continued into a crescendo of characterization, growth, and the human experience.  The clues and hints to it all are scattered throughout, but the casual fan at this point will be without one of the great things about this show.  Seek ye out the theories on sources like Lostpedia for the closest thing to the greatest gathering of minds to figure out a televised mystery that you are bound to get.  Reading the theories and talking over each episode was a big part of what made this such a special show, and it will be missed.

B000BB14YY|4.0|This 1985 Japanese film is based on the plot elements of King Lear.  Primary difference is substituting three sons for three daughters.    Hidetora, the patriarch, decides to retire and turn over the affairs of his kingdom to his three sons--Taro, Jiro, and Saburo.  Since Taro is the oldest, he receives the greater portion of the House of Ichimonji. This suits Taro's wife Kaede just fine for the time being.  William Shakespeare would have been proud of Kaede--she's cunning, intelligent, devious, beautiful and isn't afraid to use her sexuality for her own ends.    As the story goes, the old man is losing his sanity, his grip on reality.  He held his kingdom together by shredding a lot of blood and instilling fear in his subjects and enemies, Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe. When his youngest son, Saburo, tells him that his making a tragic mistake, Hidetora disinherits the young man and sends him away. Of course, Saburo's servant Tango defends his master to the old man and is vanquished as well.    It does not take Hidetora much time to realize that he cannot trust his eldest son.  So, he, his faithful companion, Kyoami, and his personal guard which are a group of mighty men go to live with Jiro, the second son.  Unknown to the old man, Kaede has convinced her husband to form an alliance with Jiro to kill the old man and his personal guard.      There is a fateful meeting between Hidetora and Sue, Jiro wife.  Hidetora had killed her family and taken the land, but Sue has embraced her religion and refuses to hate her father-in-law.    As the story progresses, there is intrigue and betrayal on almost every level.  The battle scenes are bloody.  Like King Lear this film has no happy endings for the House of Ichimonji or its servants.    The cinematography is just plain gorgeous.  The Oscar winning costumes are colorful and rich.    The character of Kyoami is well written.  Some of the best lines in this piece of art are said by him--\\"Heaven is far away but hell can be reached in a day.  In a mad world only the mad are sane. \\"    One of the most honorable servants is Kurogane, military commander of Jiro.  His moral compass is constantly tested by Jiro and Kaede.  The climax between Kurogane and Kaede is a surprise, but you accept this as the way it had to end.      I would like to end this with words from Tango: \\"Men seem to prefer sorrow over joy.  They're forever seeking out suffering and rejecting peace.\\"  The solitary flute playing brings this film to closure.
0061122416|4.0|This book is written as a fable, perhaps trying to catch a youthful audience, that tries to deliver a message on how humans can reach their dreams or greatest desires, and why so many never do. The basic lessons seem to be, don't let others dissuade you or tell you you cannot, take each set back as a learning experience, don't let others jealousy or envy cause you to stray, and never give up.<br /><br />The author cautions that many people never reach their dreams because they fear failure, so they never even try. This book suggests that the greatest failure of all is the failure to try. Regardless of what an individuals dreams are the book suggests that the greatest reward is the journey itself, and in the efforts, successful or not, made to grasp your dream.
1439181780|5.0|After reading The Power, I have come out from that journey charged!!! I feel lighter with a clarity, harmony and an ever more realized power of the universe - LOVE!!!! In this book, Rhonda Byrne goes further in explaining the true nature of The Law of Attraction and how to better harness the Law by better understanding yourself and what powers ALL our actions.    The Power provides more tools to help you harness the LOVE in yourself, in others and ultimately in the Universe. I was powerfully touched by the lessons learnt from The Secret but i didn't realize until The Power how important it is to get excited by my life and truly fall in-love with it!!!! I thought i was living in love until i read THIS book!!!!    Rhonda again breaks down the book into the important parts of our life that we all want to address and elevate to the realm of our dreams, but this time The Power takes on a much more visually elaborate, graphic and ultimately beautiful approach.  Each section provides powerful tools and stories to help us understand the subtle wisdoms about LOVE and its influence over each of these domains.    I couldn't put this book down and am deeply grateful for its wisdom and beauty. If everyone in the world read this book we would be one step closer to what the great sages of our history felt when they spoke of 'Heaven on Earth'.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Brad Anderson has presented an unparalleled trip into pshychotic fear & terror with 'Session 9'. Forget any inklings or references to 'The Shining', as this film takes place in the most notoriously haunted & scariest places in the world: Danvers State Hospital. Having seen this hospital myself in 2003, I can attest without question that this property leaves an impression which will stay with you a lifetime. Anderson masterfully presents a complex scenario of pshycho-terror that one would expect from Danvers. The storyline is straightforward: an asbestos removal company is awarded the bid to clean up various areas of the derelict hospital; but as the week progresses there is very strange happenings with Gordon (Peter Mullen), the asbestos company owner. The casting is perfect, with Peter Mullen becoming 'possessed' by \\"Simon\\", one of the  schizophrenic personalities of former patient Mary Hobbs. David Caruso performs brilliantly as the job foreman & his growing conflict with Mullen is surely one of the highlights of the film. The story touches on many areas of interest, including solitude, lonliness & the dichotomy of good & evil. A most essential horror story filmed at one of the most scariest places on earth.
0099527561|4.0|In the cover blurb for this book, Ian Rankin writes that Don Winslow is \\"so good you almost want to keep him to yourself.\\" Far be it from me to argue with Ian Rankin, but I would modestly suggest that Winslow is so good you want to shout it from the rooftops.<br /><br />\\"The Gentlemen's Hour\\" is the sequel to Winslow's \\"The Dawn Patrol,\\" featuring surfer/private eye, Boone Daniels, and again, the story is set against the backdrop of the San Diego surfing community. When a surfing idol is brutally and senselessly murdered, Boone alienates practically all of his surfing buddies when he goes to work on behalf of the attorney who is defending the spoiled-rich-kid-gangbanger-wanna-be who has confessed to the murder.<br /><br />If that's not bad enough, another friend believes that his wife is cheating on him and asks Boone to investigate. Boone soon finds himself caught up in the tangled web of not one but two cases, and he seems to be alienating people right and left as he digs into the seamier side of the California Dream, exposing secrets that a lot of people would prefer be left buried. In the meantime, Boone is also trying to sort out the possibilities of a new romantic entanglement and so life at the moment is way more complicated than it should be for a laid-back surfer dude.<br /><br />As is always the case with Winslow's books, this is an immensely entertaining ride. Fans will not be disappointed.
B003JTHESA|1.0|After seeing the 666 DVD and movie i REALLY had high hopes for Maiden to really put some umph into this next record. Well unfortunately that did not happen. Instead we got a mixed bag of mid-tempo, slow, boring uninspired music from guys who sound like maiden lite. The fierce energy of there last tour was amazing and better than anything they did in there younger days, there was so much energy it wore ME out just watching it. Well going back to the studio must bore them because it just sounds like they have ran out of any decent ideas at all. Even The Alchemist, a speedier song cannot capture anything of old, the chorus stinks and Nicko(my biggest drumming influence) sounds like he's 80 not almost 60. I mean come on, Stallone is kicking butt in movies now, and lots of old veteran rockers are still out there putting out fresh tunes that sound way better than this. Bruce is almost 52, thats it, thats ALL, the rest are a little above, Nicko being the oldest. But look at a guy like Buddy Rich who was way up in his 60's and better than EVER! My god has failed :(. The beginning of the album really makes you think Maiden has something up there sleeve with the long but pretty cool intro satellite 51, the you expect a full onslaught of Aces High or even a Caught Somewhere In Time song, with galloping rythmes and bruces great killer singing. Instead you get a washed down boring straight beat with mundane riffs and Bruce sounding like his sitting around the studio just practicing some singing and lyrics.     So in summation i'll just say that ever song sounds the same, ends the same, feels the same and just makes you wanna go stick your face on the back of a tale pipe, and suck it. Bruce should go back to his solo albums which were stellar! It sounded more like Maiden than Maiden did. While they were dishing out the Crap Factor(with Blaze Buttley), and Virtual Boredom, bruce was putting out Accident of Birth and the top rated metal album of 1998, The Chemical Wedding. Also there were some b sides like Silver Wings, and Broken that just rocked the crap out of everyone and sounded liked they came from Powerslave and Caught Somewhere In Time. So unless you can deliver in the studio guys, just let Bruce go do his own thing again, and do side projects or retire. Another album like this and there won't be any fans left, or the Record Company will say guys, enjoy the Golden Years. Bye.

B000007492|3.0|CD had quality problem... on one track it will not play properly.  Happens in all CD players.
B00006GEB4|5.0|This is an amazing album that tells a beautiful, and enthralling story from the genius minds of The Flaming Lips. I have listened to it for years and still to this day appreciate every minute of the album. I purchased the vinyl months ago when upgrading my music listening experience to a high quality vinyl system. It is absolute must own for music lovers. Even if you don't like the Lips, this is a must listen to due to its greatness. Enjoy
0440245915|5.0|John Grisham's first novel, written in 1988, and the story is an extension to an actual case, except, he takes the form of \\" What-If\\" such and such happened.     Even in the midst of vacation, this novel was an absolute page-turner for me. The legal details do not bore the reader, and many legal maneuverings can be learned from this book. Humanity prevails in the end and despite the amounting pressure to give in, Grisham managed to bring a much-desired fictitious personality to life, Jake Brigance, who despite all opposition and temptations to step down from what he believed was right, stuck through until the end.     This novel is a page-turning, life changing, (To those who really grasp the meaning of this book to their hearts and souls), and a gut-wrenching book. I highly recommend it. Very hopeful piece of art which teaches us that fictitious personalities such as Jake Brigance can come to life in the form of conscientious humans who would much rather stand by their principles than possess ample pockets.
B003O85W44|5.0|The Arcade Fire have done it again. The album is not quite as intense as Funeral, but just as epic as their three previous. It has a great feel from beginning to end. The vinyl is a must purchase due to the unique musical feel to each side of the records. Their sound has matured since being hurled into popularity instead of fizzling with pop stardom. On this album they show all sides that they have developed. This is a must purchase for any music officionado(spelling?). Anyway, pick it up. You won't be disappointed.
B000WS4PCO|2.0|I haven't heard the original master of The Joshua Tree on CD, but I just bought the 2007 remaster and it sounds absolutely awful.  The high end is completely gone...where on earth did it go?  I hope the mixes weren't actually this bad.
B00006LLLN|4.0|The dvd was well produced except Alison's comments between songs could not be heard at all.  The sound people really fell down on the job on this one.  It's odd because the volume on the singing is just fine.  The lack of good sound on the comment portion is NOT a reason to not buy this video though.  The songs and performances are great.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|I would actually give this book a three and a half stars but it is not good enough to be a four stars. I dont read books often but I know what would qualify as a really good read and as for \\"shiver\\", it would not be on the list. Mainly because the story is too simple and not mind raveling enough, I understand teenage romance is not meant to be as a deep as an ocean, but considering the circumstance, it could have been more fulfilling. However if you are really into the fantasy star-crossed lovers genre, this book is right up that alley, and for the record, I made it through this book but not did not even manage to pass the first page of twilight. The reason for that is because Stiefvater is clearly a better writter and does not lower your intelligence with simple sentences throughtout the book. The best thing about this book is the characters and how real they are, no one is perfect and everybody has  weak points that make them seem endearing. The love is sweet and sexy but not overly lustful which I believe is the downfall when it comes to stories about teenage affairs, sometimes what readers want to believe when they read stories is that love does exist in its purest form, where both persons are completely vulnerable and sam and grace exhibit that wonderfully, both characters have their own strengths and weaknesses. BUT, i really cannot stand the simple structure of the book, its one flaw is that the writing gets us through the story but does not inspire us. I hope the next books will be an improvement.
0316098337|5.0|I love this book. I felt very strongly connected to the characters and began to feel trapped in the room with them.  This indicates to me that Emma Donoghue knows how to write.  She put me in that room with these two characters.  For that amazing feat I give this book 5 stars.  I found the storyline to be disturbing and yes it took me about 10 pages to get into the dialect of a child and insert myself into what was going on.  But once there...on my.  I read this one in one night. I cannot recommend it enough, especially to someone that reads a lot of books and is tired of the same run of the mill storylines and plots.  You can read more about what this book is about in the other reviews.  I just wanted to be sure to tell you, this one will suck you in.  Yes, you may have to suspend disbelief and set aside everything else you are thinking about and doing but it's worth the ride. Captivity sounds horrible and at times I was uncomfortable in this novel..but I was oh so \\"IN\\" this story and that's why I personally love to read...to get lost in a well written novel.
0307266303|5.0|I must say that I was skeptical of the intrigue of a book dedicated to distance runners as someone who is only a casual runner and athlete. This book captured me from the beginning and I had a hard time getting things done in my life until I finished it. Finished in about 5 days of reading, and I wanted more.     McDougall does a great job of telling these three stories at once. A man's self discovery, a search for something bigger than running, and the tale of this magnificent race. His storytelling ability is incredible and each chapter begs you to turn to the next. This book has turned me into a minimalist runner, and someone who has completely changed his perspective on what running is for humankind. I cannot say enough about how great this book was, so I will simply give it my highest recommendation. Anyone who has ever spent time training for any sport or spent time in nature will fully enjoy this book.
B002ZG997C|1.0|Fundamentalist propaganda plain and simple.  Certainly destined to be a true \\"cult\\" movie.   Honestly, ALL the christian bibles were destroyed?!?! Get real, apparently the writers/directors/actors never stayed in a hotel or heard of the gideons.    If you really want to own this movie, just wait. it will be in the bargain sections for $4.99 or less very soon.   Has anyone else noticed the numerous duplicate five star reviews?  That should certainly tell you something, don't fall for it.

0385523386|3.0|I used this book as a filler for something to read while working out. It's interesting but not the kind book you can't put down. You can easily put it down. I did learn a lot about prison. It definitely cleared up some major misconceptions I didn't even realize I had about the justice system. The author randomly throws in statistics about lock-ups in the US, trying to be subtle but it is very obvious what she is implying. After reading this I will think more carefully about being involved in any thing that could come back to haunt me!
B003Z0D4SM|3.0|I bought this book because of the marketing hype, and I wanted to find out for myself what it is all about. It is a mystery/suspense/thriller that lives up to its genre, but I don't think the hype is warranted. The first part of the book starts off too slow, but when the two main characters meet (past the half-way point of the book) then things unravel too fast. The translation from Swedish to English is very well done despite a couple of odd words or phrases that don't sound quite right. It was fun to look up the meaning of Swedish names. There are lots of product placement references (things and authors).<br /><br />WARNING: There are a couple of instances of graphic and disturbing sexual violence. The first one really took me by surprise, especially since I was reading in a public place, and up to that point my mind was still focused on the plot exposition.<br /><br />I don't think I will be reading the other two books in the trilogy. I have other (better) books to read first. Once the movie comes out, as it will inevitably do, I'm sure the screenplay will chop out the slow bits of the book.
B002N1AERI|5.0|I don't have a lot of time to write a complex and deep review filled with references to other symphonic metal bands like other reviews have. I just don't have the metal knowledge for that. I can say, though, that from what I've heard of the metal genre, Epica is right up there with Nightwish and other bands in their near-perfect blending of gorgeous vocals, deep lyrics, power riffs, and orchestral composition.    I have this and Divine Conspiracy on constant rotation in iTunes. This album in particular is extremely powerful and moving, containing highly detailed compositions filled with epic imagery and WILL move you to tears at least once. Especially on \\"Tides of Time,\\" during which I always cry. Once you start to grasp the meaning of these tracks, that humanity can pull itself out of the abyss we have pushed ourselves into with our greed and arrogance, things start to become clear. This is the 21st century, humanity needs futuristic music to inspire it to success in the coming age.    We, as a species, have forgotten what it truly means to be human, and have focused on our achievements and our technological prowess. These things have led to our decline, as Epica so rightly notes many times in this album. Even though we have plunged our planet into a seemingly unrecoverable doom with endless war and environmental disasters, it's not too late. This album encapsulates that feeling, that hope for a better tomorrow that has finally arrived. It is such deep and thoroughly thoughtful music it almost transcends its own genre to become something akin to pure emotion, pure light. Maybe it's a light of penance, who can tell.    Either way, Epica has outdone themselves. This may be the pinnacle of their art, but we'll have to wait and see what they come up with next.
0020442203|4.0|Dear All who read this...    I recently ordered this book, and was happy about the price.  I only spent $.01 on the book!  I think it is ironic that the shipping cost more than the book, but it was a lot cheaper than driving across the country to get it.  I love books.  For me, books are a life source.  I was going to rate this a 5 star purchase, but I wasn't fully satisfied.  When I bought the book, the discription said it was in excellent condition.  Well, I was not pleased to find that there was writing in the cover and on the page sides.  Plus, and I don't understand why, the company put a sticker on the cover that tore as I was trying to remove it.  You see, I collect books.  The set that this book belongs to is now complete, however, this book is slightly damaged and now defaced.  I am happy about having it, but I would have liked it to be free of writing and stickers.  Overall, the company who sent me the book is very professional and quick to reply.  They were friendly, and I didn't have to wait too long for the book.  I believe I got it in like 4 or 5 days.  So, that is why I only rated it with a 4.  However, I was happy with the company overall.  I will buy from them again.    Thanks,  Sir Romeo Mango

B002ZG98J6|5.0|my kids love this movie!! my 4 year old has watched it numerous times! it was very well made
B003MX5P20|5.0|I've always been an Enrique fan.  He does not disappoint with each album.  I am glad that he is doing more collaborations, not only with Latin artists but recognized artists.  This CD is especially good for that drive home after a long day.
0545123283|4.0|It took me 1/4 of the book to actually care about the characters btu after that i really enjoyed it. Simple light read- nothing too serious, but good playful young romance book.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I gave this game to my nephew, to my grandson and then got one for me.  It is a fun game to play for all ages. Even 5 yr olds can play.  Even more exciting when 4 people play.  The kids are holding their next piece to play even before it is their turn.   I love it.
B003QCCS36|4.0|I love Ray's voice and music.  'Till The Sun Turns Black is my absolute favourite release... love about everything about that one.  I've seen Ray 5 times now, and almost each concert is a different experience.    About the new album.  I hate the prominent use of the pedal steel... it makes the music sound cheesy and very outdated. I totally miss the sparse use of the strings instead - they gave the songs a more dark and moody feel to it where needed (TTSTB).  Besides that, everything A-OK! Ray's voice is sublime again, most songs outstanding. That little rough edge in songs like Repo Man and Devil's In The Jukebox is so amazing.... want more of that!  And off course those two songs (no pedal steel!!!!) are my favourites, then This Love Is Over (pedal steel in the background!!) and everything that follow's.  I would love to hear God Willin' with strings instead of that pedal steel.... I'm sure it would turn into a favourite as well.  Ray, please ditch that prominet pedal steel in your songs. I do understand why it is used: it helps winning over a huge US (C&W) market.  Maybe put out two version with every release: use of pedal steel for the US, sparse use of strings for Europe.
B00000099Y|5.0|Received item much faster than we expected and couldn't be happier with it!  Personally, I think Tool is one of the best bands ever, so all that really concerned me with this purchase is that the cd would be free of scratches and play as loud as humanly possible...which it does, so yeah...I'm thrilled with this purchase.
0307454541|5.0|One of the best suspense story teller I have ever read. The characters are vivd and the story line holds throughout the book, makes you want to read the next in the series
B003OT4LZY|1.0|I have a seriously spiritual, religious, and simple humble transformation going in my own life and I'm double the age of Richard Ashcroft, 20 twenty years at work on it myself. Richard Ashscraft has many times inspired me to keep reaching for the transcendent. Having said that, and  pointing out, I love all Verve albums, progressive and psychedeic music in general, from Kramer's Crystal mix to Can's Ege Bamyashi. These remarks are just by way of making the point that Richard Ashcroft can sing songs like \\"Catch the Meaning,\\" which in itself is inspired, if pretty preachy, till the cows come home, and I'm there buying his records. This is not prejudice against his message. I agree with about 80% of his message. I will leave that to others. This is just pure and simple a commentary on the music on this album. It is without a doubt, one of the works rock records ever made. I suppose it might get him invited back to sing at a tent revival in South Carolina, which I think is where he really wants to be. More power to him. I have listened to it five times now. It is appalling. Absolutely appalling. They hooked us in with \\"Are You Ready,\\" a pretty good standard Ashcroft song, but there isn't even close to one other song on the album that I can ever listen to again,after five listens. The price they are charging for this ... the pre-order? What total merchandizing cynical hype!  don't even Toby Keith fans, not to dis them, could listen to this. He could perhaps sell it at Foxwood or Vegas. Maybe that's where he's headed. He can rake in humble millions. The guitar playing is cliche beyond belief, the heartfelt confessions seem like \\"card-board, cutout, sundowns,\\", and frankly, I think the ego and salvation vanity is over the top. There's grace for everyone, and a chance for atonement. He perhaps should spend five years with Calvin's Institutes, fifteen years with Augustine's Confessions, or his writings on the Trinity, or go to Orovillle, or Safed for immense, disciplined \\"turning, or perhaps go into a real, standard seminary. But as it stands, his boxing and working out for Jesus is blasphemous and over the top. This is the worst record I have heard since something by Foghat, or Journey, years ago, in my adult life. In fact worse than those. Considering how much inspiration and joy I have gotten from this artist, I have no further idea what to even say. He doens't need a pentecostal revival, he just need the best psychiatrist money and can buy in London and maybe his old band back. Then he could make great records and sing poignant songs like Appalachian Springs,  calmly, proceed as a good citizen and witnessing Christian, that song brought me to my knees in the sunset of western Kansas, for the rest of his life. But please, don't make any more records until you figure this out. This is the guy that had the brass to go on Letterman with just an acoustic guitar and a sax playe and blow the doors down. This is absolutely tragic!!! If you're a Foghat or Journey fan, my sincere apologies, for I am not into polarizing people over music of \\"dissing\\" other peoples' acts, my sincere Christian apologies.  Verve fans...watch out!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Cyndi Lauper NEVER disappoints! Her voice is as amazing as ever! This woman can sing ANYTHING!!!
0446310786|4.0|the book was great and it came on time. the only problem was that the pages were folded, but other then that it was good
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|I had never heard of Ray LaMontagne when I purchased the cd but I am damn glad I did. Great haunting music that just touches your soul.
B002RWKSII|5.0|This is one outstanding CD. A great blend of Brian Wilson's Beach Boys sound with the classic work of George and Ira Gershwin. Talk about mixes! Wilson produced the album and orchestrated it with Paul von Mertens, a member of Wilson's band.  All eleven tracks are excellent.    My favorite track, \\"The Like in I Love You,\\" is one of the two Gershwin tunes on this disc that Wilson, working with band member Scott Bennett, finished. I first heard this track, with its strong and crisp vocals, playing on a bookstore's sound system and asked myself, \\"Is that Brian Wilson?\\"
B00008K7AM|5.0|\\"The Hot Chick\\" is an extremely hilarious movie about a girl who suddenly switches bodies with a man who is a wanted criminal. The film deals with the girl and her friends trying to find out what has happened and their efforts in getting the girl back to her female self. Rob Schneider is excellent as \\"the girl\\" whose body has invaded the wanted fugitive.<br /><br /> The film sort of reminds me of \\"Freaky Friday\\" where a girl switches bodies with her mother.<br /><br /> Upon release to theatres in 2002 \\"The Hot Chick\\" went on to enjoy enormous boxoffice raking in over $50,000,000 worldwide. The DVD set sold huge quantaties as well. The DVD includes deleted scenes, an alternate ending, a music video, and much more.<br /><br /> \\"The New York Post\\" says, \\"I haven't laughed harder at anything this year!\\"
1881273873|5.0|I raved over the original 5 Love Languages book and my friend loves this book and has learned so much. She is very thankful.  It was also a great deal at Amazon which is always the first place I look for everything that I buy.
1594488843|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It wasn't anything new and groundbreaking, but Pink looked at a lot of research on human motivation and sums it up nicely for us.    Lots of others summed this book up very well, so what I want to talk about is the second half of the book. Pink basically uses the back half of the book for \\"how-to's\\" on applying this into different areas of your life. While others found it meaningless and unhelpful, I thought it was great. He uses examples of schools that are changing the way they encourage children to learn, self-motivation, self-evaluation, etc. I recommend this book.
B002ZG9918|5.0|While the plot to this movie isn't great the dancing more than makes up for it...if you're a big Adam G Sevani fan (Moose from step up 2 the streets) you will absolutely love him after seeing him in the second one..he is one of the best dancers around and hes still only 18 (he certainly steals the show from the main character Luke that's for sure)...it does have some LOL bits that did make me laugh out load...the dances in this one are definitely a step up from the first and second films...i really liked the 3D effects too...i have seen quite a few 3D films this year and was really disappointed with many of them they may have had 10-15 bits actually coming out at you while this film has many more....if the bonus features on this DVD are gonna be anything like Step up 2's then it would be worth it just to see the added extras....hopefully things like how the movie comes to life and all the hard work that goes into it will be on there...really loved the ending it had lots of creativity and imagination and a couple of little surprises along the way...although the ending was predictable....i would give it a 9/10 and most of that is for the dancing...will definitely be buying this when it comes out....
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said by so many reviews that have already been written. Ditto? Cuz everyone whose seen SOA are hooked and for a damn good reason. Sons Of Anarchy is the most frikkin' awesome show on television! Everything is excellent - the episodes, the dialogue and the casting. If you haven't seen SOA crawl out from under your rock and check it out - it won't disappoint.

B0015DROBO|4.0|a very good read. the first section is a bit slow as the plot develops but hang in there, it gets addictive
1439156816|4.0|I know nothing of writing outside my high scholl creative writing class but have always loved Stephen king books, so when I came across this book by my favorite author, I wanted to see what he had to say. Frankly, I liked it. Mr king has a style of writing that makes you feel as if he is sitting with you and telling you a story. This book is know different. I felt as if I were having coffee with him while he told me his thoughts on how to write a story. He does not add all the fluff my old teachers thought were important about writing but gets to the knitty gritty of how best to put your thougths into a coherant piece of work. I found the book interesting and useful.
0307387178|5.0|First caught a glimpse of the movie, than read the book, and than watched the entire movie again. Both were great, both where different. You just can't simply try to understand the movie without reading the book first, it has much more depth. My reviews are going to be more towards the bad reviewers and those who criticized Christopher McCandless.     Isn't mankind's greatest ambition is to look beyond the stars and find ourselves amongst the universe? To set out blindly in the hopes that we discover something greater than ourselves.     The human spirit is always seeking adventure and the greatest rewards come from the greatest of challenges and difficulties. The challenge of knowing you can never be fully prepared no matter how much preparation and time you've given yourself. The idea of making the best out of a bad situation and getting the most out of what you have. Christopher said it best in his letter to Wayne when he said that his travels where too easy with all the money he had given him with his paycheck. That things were a lot more exciting when he was penniless.     Through the book you realize that his problem with his family meant nothing overall because the fact is everyone one comes from some degree of a dysfunctional family and the experience you gain from those moments in your life are what builds your characteristics. The story is about human ambition, the raw nature of the human spirit, to explore knowledge beyond our horizon and this is revealed through Christopher's story.     Those who criticize his story and his individuality are those who are lost in today's society. Lost in their secure 9 to 5 jobs, weekend getaways, and nightly extravaganzas. Those who measure their lives with the wealth they've accumulated and could never see the world beyond their front door. Would you be on the same pages of those who thought it was insane to colonize in North America and deal with the Natives after Columbus had accidently discovered the new world. Or thought the Lewis and Clark expedition across America was too farfetched. Or perhaps the Wright Brothers should have never even attempted to build a machine that can fly because in your mind it goes against the realm of normal. Without the attempts of these historic individuals, America would not be where it is today. But that's alright, be content with your simple minded life because when it's all over and you're lying on your deathbed, you wouldn't even begin to comprehend your existence in this universe.
B002T9H2LK|3.0|[[ASIN:B002T9H2LK Inglourious Basterds (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]    Was pretty good movie but, it also was a little hard to believe, because history did not work that way.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This album is just fantastic, don't listen to the haters. If you want confirmation on why not? Look at all the people who disagree with the one star critiques.    First things first, I have to say that the flow of this album is just superb, each song flows in a line up that has an effect of awe and power that caused me to feel intense headbanging creeping upon me. Track 8 'The hardest part of letting go...' is placed in the right spot to cause a more mellow break from the intense metal. I liked it.  The songs are well thought out, polished, and unleashed in a way that you can tell that the band put their heart and soul into the making of the album. Some may disagree with me, but I don't care, I really think this album has soul.     The guitar riffs are heavy and have, I dare say, a modern sound. The mix of the album is very good, all elements are present within the mix. The guitar solos are included as in all of Megadeth's music, but generally I am not a person huge on wicked fast solos, but they were done well enough to my ear. What I really liked was the harmony guitar parts, and I feel they were executed very well. Case and point the beginning of track 3 and chorus of '44 minutes.' Just beautiful.    There is much to be said about this album, but I will leave the deeper critiques to others. My two cents is that the album is Fantastic. Well done Dave, well done Megadeth.
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie it was good. Performances from Greg Kinnear,Miley Cyrus,Liam Hemsworth were all very good! For the most part the movie had some similarities to the book but the book gave a bit more that the movie didn't provide at least for me. People should see this movie but make sure you have tissues near by because you will need them. The book is excellent though and I would highly recommend people read the book first then watch the movie!
B002ZG974M|5.0|The concept is deceptively simple: follow four babies from four different countries from birth til they take their first steps ~ 1 year old.  As others have noted, there is no (spoken) narrative. Rather, the camera documents the four babies in the same situations : being born, first smile, at play, sleeping, etc.  I watched this movie with my daughters and we all absolutely loved it (I was glad that they did not actually show the birth process).  We all had our favorite babies - my daughters loved \\"Hattie\\" from San Francisco but I fell in love with the baby from Mongolia as he was so adorably mischievous.  This multi-cultural perspective on babies is utterly fascinating.  You will find yourself asking such questions as \\"Which baby seems the happiest?\\" (asked by my 9 year-old daughter); \\"What do babies REALLY need to thrive?\\" - toys, shelves FULL of books, or just a loving mom and a roll of toilet paper?  There is a particular scene where Hattie bites her mom and instead of reprimanding her (like the Mongolian mother did when the baby was naughty), she pulls out a book entitled ~\\"No Biting\\".  It's also interesting as an American parent, to see how \\"sterile\\" our babies are compared to the babies that grow up in countries like Mongolia and Namibia.  Most importantly,as a parent, it makes you appreciate the \\"magic\\" of raising a child.  A must see for all parents, and lovers of children, including children themselves.  It is also a very entertaining movie.  My girls laughed out loud and had me rewind it (rented and recorded it on Cable) in several places.  Be forewarned: it may increase your urge to have a baby-I luckily slapped sense back to myself.
0060899220|5.0|What can I say?  If you love Anthony Bourdain, you will love this book!  I always expect him to be funny, crude and blatantly honest, and he never disappoints in this book!  Read it!
B00008OM7U|4.0|This isn't some parent of goth rock, don't believe the hype; The Lords of the New Church at the time was still breathing the clean, fresh fetid air of punk rock. Side One, I must say since the record is so damn obscure, is a tour de force of moody, wickedly crafted rock 'n roll. You can see where a cat like Roland S. Howard got his chops listening to this. But the spirit of '79 is still alive in here. I played this straight up tonight after \\"London Calling\\" and it wasn't a tough move. Stiv comes from punk, but he's got his Bunnymen and he probably has got his Doors. The DJ in me said, next up, late-model Siouxee and the Banshees. The record is terrific, and it's becoming a lost night player. Highly recommended.
B000059TEP|5.0|Ghost is a timeless classic. It's one of the best love stories ever made, combined with action, comedy, drama, thriller and romance. They actors are great. Patrick, Demi and Whoopi all have great chemistry together. I love it.

B000055Y0X|5.0|This is an important classic movie. Brilliantly conceived and directed by Stanley Kubrick. Peter Sellers is fantastic in multiple roles. It's as fresh and relevant today as it was then. I've seen it many times and it's one of the few DVDs that I own.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|This is by far the most bizarre WW2 film I've ever seen.  Brad Pitt plays an Army lieutenant who leads a small band of Jewish-American soldiers in a guerrilla campaign behind enemy lines.  There they act in terroristic fashion, capturing and slaughtering small groups of German soldiers for their scalps.  Pitt's character in fact demands \\"100 Nazi scalps\\" of each of his men as a price for joining his unit.  The purpose of all this killing and maiming is to strike terror in the hearts of those who have kept occupied Europe in the grip of fear for years.    One thing I noticed is that the movie dispenses with the usual formulas - very refreshing!  There is no \\"boy meets girl and the two fall in love\\" angle.  There is no \\"show how noble the hero is by having him refrain from killing his evil opponent\\" nonsense, a la Batman saving the Joker's life in the Dark Knight.      Pitt's Basterds are viciously cruel to those they capture, even gleefully so.  In this sense the film is far more realistic than the usual formulaic crap Hollywood throws at us.  In real war the only thing that separates the \\"good guys\\" from their enemies is the   side they fight for.  In their methods they are just as savage and barbaric as their foes.  Anyone who doubts this need only review the bombing of Dresden by Allied planes.      Those who gave this fantastic movie one star can't face that, thus their ridiculous \\"weren't the 'heroes' just as bad as the Nazis?\\" remarks.  The problem with this line of reasoning should be obvious to them.  No action is divorced from the context in which it occurs.  Just because a deed turns your stomach doesn't make it any less correct.  Like it or not, in the real world the end usually does justify the means.    I dinged \\"Basterds\\" one star simply because in many other ways it is totally implausible.  Eight guys behind Nazi lines successfully eluding capture for months or years?  Nonsense.  The US Army not ensuring that each of those men, especially their leader,speak fluent German?  Even more nonsensical.  The prospect of the four top leaders of Hitler's Reich all being in the same place at the same time, in an occupied country with a strong resistance movement? Preposterous.    Despite these weaknesses I loved the movie overall.  Be advised: this is an \\"alternate reality\\" take on the war.  Don't expect it to remain faithful to the history books. As a fun way to spend two hours or so it's definitely worth your time, however.  Highly recommended.
0470601787|5.0|I knew from the very first mention of Visual Meetings, it would be a great book. Now that I have finally been able to sit down and read it word for word - goodness! I usually fold back the corners of pages that I want to refer back to but honestly, I'd just have to fold back every page so far, so am using that tried and true old fashioned method of highlighting the things that stick out for me.    I am particularly thrilled - and I have just read 3 or 4 chapters! - by the clear explanations about why what we do (graphic recording and graphic facilitation) works - things that the corporate clients I work with will be able to 'grok' and comprehend. I have never been especially skilled at explaining why it (graphic recording and facilitation) matters, why it makes a difference, and I am now soo armed with concise explanations, in language I understand and can properly - and convincingly - convey (cause it's true and I believe what I'm saying) -  I am just delighted and inspired.    I hope Visual Meetings flies off the shelves.
B00092QUQC|5.0|I found out about Gotthard (Switzerland) just recently and keep wondering why this guys never made it outside Switzerland. They are just amazing !!!

030726999X|5.0|When it comes to insults, nothing hurts quite like the truth.  After the action novel is over, and the fight to the death finished, the fight for life begins, and society begins to ask questions about what happened.  These are the topics of Stieg Larrson's third and final book, after the intense action of the second novel of the series that began with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  Not that there aren't any stunning action scenes, or final battles in The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, but that the focus is on resolution and revelation.  The tension in this novel comes from the characters desperately rushing to reveal the truth before the proof is destroyed by their enemies.<br /><br />As this is the last volume of a trilogy, I can't imagine anyone wanting to read it without first reading the others, but for those new to the works of Stieg Larrson, be assured that they are not merely by the same author.  They do in fact go together, with the same characters, and if your book store does not make it clear, they are, in order: The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played With Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  These are all the kind of books that won't let you stop reading, either.  In fact, I couldn't read this one fast enough, I was so concerned about events, and found myself jumping down the page in my eagerness to be sure everything would work out alright for the characters I had become so fond of in the first two books.
B001TN1EBG|5.0|I have all of William's albums but this cd is undeniably my favorite!  I think he is one of the best musicians in this genre due to his simplicity and authenticity. His music is calming and delivers a message that is untainted by Top 40. All of William's albums speak to you and offer a door into his personal heartaches and burdens. His voice is gentle and his lyrics are from the heart. If you have ever had a broken heart or been discouraged, you can relate to the musical testaments in each of his songs.  The instruments perfectly compliment the vocals creating a sound that is phenomenal.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album; especially if you wish to feel something from the music and not just hear a tune.<br />Some of my favorite tracks include: \\"After All\\", \\"Even Now\\", \\"You Still Hurt Me\\", and a duet I love...  \\"I Don't Feel It Anymore\\", and \\"Just Not Each Other\\" - with lyrics like \\"You broke my heart, all that's forgiven.  We lost our chance to love one another.  We'll love again, but just not each other..\\"<br /><br />PS. He is great live, also!  I saw him with Rosi Golan (check out the duet with William she did called \\"Hazy\\") and it was amazingly emotional.  If you ever get the chance, definitely check him out!  And, to quote William, go \\"get your sad on\\"!
B00005JNS0|5.0|While I personally really liked this movie, I had a copy sent to my grandson in Switzerland.  After it was received, my son informed me the DVD did not work with the format used in Europe.  Amazon should possibly alert customers sending items to foreign destinations of things like this. Unfortunately, I was not aware of what is used overseas.
145283668X|5.0|I had been wanting to read this book for years and finally got to it... I would recommend it to ANYONE looking for a wonderfully written suspenseful read. I loved how short it was - got through it so quickly! It would be a great book to take on a short trip or on the bus as it is easy to stash in your purse.

0307454541|5.0|I saw the movie first and thought I bet this book is great. It was a great book and so much better than the movie (as always) I wanted to continue to read it and am excited that there are 2 more books to read!
0893860220|5.0|I have been reading in the area of Indian/Hindu/Buddhist literature for years and in my searches at Amazon for books like the Bhagavad Gita, Vasistha's Yoga, Shankara and other works mainly in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta philosophy, I kept seeing a bright yellow book, I Am That, by an author I had never heard of. I paid no attention but I kept thinking about how many reviews it had and how positive they were, so I did an Internet search and found a website that had it for a free Word download. I had just gotten an iPod, which I now love more than my wife, and downloaded I Am That onto it.  A few pages into it I was hooked.  The only works that I can compare this to is Seth Speaks by Jane Roberts, Emerson, and maybe by beloved Plotinus, although Plotinus' style necessarily lacks the personal punch of Sri Nisargadatta. When I go to lunch I pull out my iPod (I eat lunch alone since I am living in Thailand and I guess no one wants to try to speak English with me)and read a few pages of I AM That propped up against the salt shaker.  This book is SO REFRESHING.  When you read Seth Speaks, whatever you think of the characterization of the source of the material, it just seems to ring true; the same for Emerson. And the same for Sri Nisargadatta.  Like Jane and Emerson, Sri Nisargadatta always comes back to the personal/experiential, and therein lies the book's entertainment if I may use this word in the broadest sense and value. I have a smile on my face as I write this remembering his forthright responses to his sometimes inane interlocutors (\\"Of course, what do you expect?\\").  You won't find the systematic presentation of a world view that you find in Jane Roberts or Plotinus.  What I feel you will find is the sharp, honest, deeply profound views of a man that truly knows, in Jane Robert's/Seth's words, that we create our reality, that everything we perceive stems from an \\"unknown\\" (again Jane's term) and spiritual reality, and that that reality can perhaps best be characterized by \\"understanding love.\\"  No axe to grind, nothing to sell; just an eloquent presentation of insights from what has to be one of the great seers of the modern era (discounting the humble, unassuming people, as Sri Nisargadatta would say, that we might see but don't recognize as such in our daily lives). This book is a gem.  I have to laugh at myself: what seemed to me at first to be the hyperbole of the other reviews now just seems right. This is the book that I would take to a desert island, etc.  It is true that the questions in the book (it is in dialog format)are at times asked by people whose necks you want to wring (see how much I have learned from the book!; I wonder if people actually asked these questions or if they were edited by a well-intended pupil) and the printing is atrocious (commas in weird places), but I find myself scanning the questions to get to what Sri Nisargadatta has to say, which is often not what you would think.  That is one of the joys of the book; they are the words of a man who makes deep connections and flashes them before our eyes for our entertainment and of course, his main point, our better understanding of ourselves and hence our world. This is a great great book written by a man that apparently had the simplicity of a saint, living in a crowded, modest environment and having people throng to his small apartment to hear him talk.  I wish he were still with us--I would be on the next plane. I can't say more than or even compete with the information provided by the other reviews.  But like one reviewer, I just wanted to throw in my own two cents in case I could bring another reader to this book.  I have since bought several copies of the real book for myself and my friends, and will eventually read it and highlight the parts I like especially.  In the meantime, my iPod seems to be a magical box with the words of Sri Nisargadatta on the little screen.  One final note.  I see that there is a paperback edition for almost twice the money that was published several years after this paperback edition.  I wonder if it is any better in terms of punctuation.t twice the money that was published several years after this paperback edition.  I wonder if it is any better in terms of punctuation.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Most breakup movies focus on the female-how she copes with her breakup and how she finds a new Prince Charming who sweeps her off her feet. This movie, however, couldn't be more polar opposite. The movie is told through the eyes of Tom, played perfectly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. We see how he falls head over heels for the beautiful, sweet, Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel. The story goes far enough in depth to where we can sympathize for Tom when he and Summer break up. We watch Tom carefully disect everything that could have possibly made the relationship turn sour, and it's completely believable; Gordon-Levitt makes us relate to Tom and look into ourselves. After a breakup, who hasn't thought about every little detail that could have ruined the relationship? Things like not answering a phone call, or cancelling dates together, or even not complimenting the person. As the film progresses, Summer is portrayed cynically by Tom, subtly hinting that she tricked him into loving her. Tom tries to make Summer fall in love with him, even though early in the relationship Summer tells him she doesn't want a serious relationship.     One part of this film that's my most favorite is the scene where the screen is vertically split; It shows Tom's expectations on one side, while reality is on the other. Of course, reality is the total opposite of what he's hoping will happen. This perfectly sums up the entire movie in my opinion, because throughout the story, Tom expects Summer to fall in love with him, and the reality is, she doesn't.    The chemistry between Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel makes this movie sparkle; They both were perfectly cast and really worked well together. If you're looking for a movie to pull out your blanket, a pint of your favorite ice cream, and curl up on the couch, this is a fantastic film. I won't give the ending away, but I was left a little disappointed. It's cute, but I didn't feel it went with the whole tone of the movie. Personally, it is my favorite movie, and I highly recommend it if you're a fan of Zooey Deschanel's or Joseph Gordon-Levitt's other films.
145283668X|5.0|Jekyll and Hyde is a classic that everyone knows about but few sit down to read. I was surprised at how short it was compared to other books from that genre. I think that if you are just starting out reading Gothic horror, this is a great place to start. At $4.50 the price isn't bad either.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|My reasons for reading \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" were purely selfish.  I had no need for inner enlightenment, (so I thought) or urge to live vicariously through another.  I love the idea of 4 months in Italy, but had no desire to hear someone else's account of it, and while meeting some beautiful Brazilian man sounds appealing, it's just not in my cards.<br /><br />Nope, simply put... I just wanted to watch the movie. (Which means in \\"OCD Land\\" that I had to read the book first.)<br /><br />My hopes for EPL were a big fat goose egg. I am (admittedly) not that big of a fan of Non-fiction, but the more I read, the more I realized this book was not about 1 one woman's journey to find the things she felt she had lost, no... this book was a 12 month experience in what your head, and heart can handle if you make up your mind to confront them.<br /><br />Now, I can't really breakdown this book in the traditional sense (which is one of the reason's I choose to avoid novel's like this) but I can offer you a little insight into how it reads. Elizabeth Gilbert is witty. Amidst the paragraphs of self loathing,  and her search for the perfect meditation mantra she tends to crack jokes at herself.  This is a very good thing, otherwise it would basically be 400 pages of college level psychology classes, and Gandhi talk. Instead... think of this as a week long discovery channel mini-series on the inner workings of traditional and non-traditional prayer, add a dash of pizza obsession, a few (very awkward) banana references and viola, you have Gilbert's travel journal.<br /><br />What could have very easily been the most boring book on the planet was actually entertaining, and while yes... Gilbert tends to get a little wordy in places, (oh dear lord please answer MY prayer and make her move on) in the end I didn't seem to mind so much. The topics in which I was learning about were things  I never (in a million years)  would have guessed myself caring about,  yet I found myself unable to stop reading about them, engrossed by the semblance of them all I guess you could say.<br /><br />In the end I would concur that my eyes have been opened, my head has been scolded, and my respect for yoga has grown exponentially.<br /><br />My final thoughts: This book is DEFINITELY not for everyone. If you are one of those people that demand a plot, and could careless for mundane details like; why guru's have 109 beads on their prayer necklaces, then this book will act like Ambien and lull you to sleep in minutes, but if you are a non-fiction fan, and don't mind learning a few new things, take a chance on it; you just might find some inner peace yourself.<br /><br />Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: \\"Happiness is the consequence of personal effort.

B003JTHXN6|4.0|I love shoes (mostly because they usually fit even if you've gained ten pounds) and am a huge fan of [...]--after all who doesn't like free shipping BOTH ways and \\"surprise\\" upgrades?  So, I was fascinating to learn about the company's history and overall was inspired by the Hsieh's story.     Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion and Purpose combines an entrepreneurial success story with valuable lessons on leadership, marketing, branding, customer service and corporate culture. It is written in a very conversational style and is easy to read.     Whether you're an entrepreneur, corporate executive or someone who's in a career transition, I think you'll find something in the book that will motivate you--or at least get you thinking with a different lens.     If you can gloss over the occasional grandiose statements, there's a lot to take-away from Delivering Happiness. The unwillingness to compromise on brand, culture and values. The importance of continual development and growth. The vision to create and sustain \\"WOW\\" customer service. The pursuit of happiness.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Whenever people start proclaiming something 'the greatest ever', I always get a bit wary. One, because hype is usually, well, based on hype and not fact, and it eventually becomes self-sustaining (ie people jump on the bandwagon of acclaiming something, just because they feel all the 'critics' have done so). Two, because even if it isn't overblown too much, I am usually disappointed when I had my hopes in the sky.     'Citizen Kane', well, I think it's hard to make its case as the greatest movie ever made, but it *is* Damn good. Do yourself a favor, and don't just watch it once, pass judgment, and reference it to your friends every once and a while just so you can feel Cultured. Actually THINK about this movie. ^-^ I promise you it's worth your time. I watched the documentary about it, read various reviews/essays about it, then re-watched it...only then did its scope truly sink in. \\"Gee,\\" I can hear you saying. \\"Shouldn't something truly Great strike you the first instant you see it?\\" Yes, I agree, but truly great things also require digestion. This movie is Good upon first viewing, and becomes Great when you give it the time it deserves.      Quite apart from the movie, the story behind how it was made was also larger than life. Do yourself another favor, and read up about the Orson Welles - William Rudolph Hearst clash. It's Fascinating, and sheds another layer of light on this fantastic film.    My only negative comment as that the DVD skipped a little (straight out of the box!). Apart from that, Highly recommended.
0399156577|5.0|Although I like all of Nora Roberts' books, this was one I absolutely couldn't put down. It was exciting to the very last page. Add a little romance, and it makes for a great all-around book.
0553381687|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend after I mentioned how much I had enjoyed 'A Murder of Crows' by Alexandre J. Wynne (it doesn't seem to be well-known at all, so I'm posting the link: [[ASIN:B003XO1GG2 A Murder of Crows]] ). Both novels are dark and feature deliciously complex characters, and I must say, I am *hooked* on this brand of gritty fantasy.<br /><br />This novel definitely has the edge over 'A Murder of Crows', although that's what I would expect from such a more well-known author. I'm not a huge fantasy reader in general (these books are LONG!), but based on the two afore-mentioned books, I must say I am impressed. In the past I generally stuck more to the 'classics' and considered fantasy to be for people who didn't have the focus to read true literature. I can't believe how wrong I was. These two books are literature in their own right, even though they weren't written 100 years ago. George R. R. Martin especially deals deftly with moral and political issues very relevant to today's world, and provides a great deal of food for thought and self-reflection. I know there are literally thousands of reviews about this book, but I wanted to add my voice to the crowd and say: this is not overrated. It is everything the reviews say and more.<br /><br />-Marie

B00192IOBA|3.0|This album is pretty good.  Mraz sticks with his usual light, happy style of music for the most part with some more upbeat songs.  His sound doesn't change much from song to song here and doesn't seem very creative.  New tricks, please.
B003JTHESA|5.0|First off, due to the progressive nature of the music, this album needs to be listened to a few times in order to be fully appreciated. There is so much experimenting going on that it can be a bit much to try and absorb it all at once. I felt that this was also the case with A Matter of Life and Death. At first listen it seems a bit overwhelming for the listener, but after multiple listens it simply gets better.     I can honestly say that every song on here is unique. I like the fact that they've changed and lean more towards progressive. The musicianship is amazing, as is always the case. Bruce's voice is still going strong, the guitar trio shines like never before, Nicko's drumming seems heavier, and the bass is as prominent as ever.     While I feel that A Matter of Life and Death was better (To this day, I think it's probably their best album), you can't really compare the two. In fact, you can't compare this album to anything Maiden has done before. If you're one of those fans who only want them to play 80's, I'm sorry to inform you that it's not going to happen. This album has faint traces of the 80's Maiden (they still have those characteristic melodic solos and the galloping bass) but is very different in terms of songwriting. Personally, I think this is good. Real fans don't want to hear another Powerslave or Number of the Beast. Maiden is progressive now.     If you're a fan of Maiden, and you're not stuck in the past with Powerslave, I definitely recommend picking this album up. Give it a few listens before you judge and you'll find that this album is quite impressive and may even be one of their best.

0061714372|4.0|I enjoyed reading Dave Mustaine's book and learning more about the man that has often been misunderstood, misinterpreted, and even villanized.  I could never understand the consistent changes to the band's line-up or inconsistent quality of their later albums.  This book has shed a lot of light on these subjects, and I came away with more respect for the man Dave Mustaine.  Unfortunately, his major roadblock to even more unprecedented success was his excessive substance abuse.  His story is synonymous with members of other bands, and he is lucky to be alive, just like certain members of Motley Crue, etc.  I appreciate his uncompromising commitment to try to be the best musically, and Megadeth certainly has produced some awesome songs.  I welcome his candor and his insight into his family life and finally coming to terms with his struggles with religion and finding God.  I now understand a lot more about Mustaine and Megadeth, but I wanted to know more about the stories behind his songs, etc; his book is no exception to many biographies that are heavy on details at the start and fade into generalities when it comes to present day.  It's like the author is tired of writing and wants to get to just the main points and end the book.  I also came away from the reading the book with less respect for Metallica that gave him a raw deal, and continued their antics in their demeaning relationship with bassist Jason Newstead.  I can only imagine what Metallica would be like today had Dave stayed and/or Cliff Burton hadn't died.  They would be different, but better in the long run I think.  However, Dave Mustaine persevered and made a name for himself in heavy metal history.  I highly recommend this book.  Thanks for sharing it with the public Dave.
B000FIMG68|5.0|So I'm really glad that I decided to watch this show on DVD instead of on TV. When the first season ended, I almost threw something at the TV until I realized that I had the 2nd season ready to go so I could immediately put it in and continue watching.<br /><br />Another reason that I'm glad to be watching this show on DVD is because there are a lot of little things to pick up on between the flashbacks and the present time. The characters continue to have a lot of depth and the interaction is wonderful. I have to say that my favorite character is John Locke who is a definite enigma.<br /><br />This is a great show, if you haven't seen it, it's well worthwhile. If you have, you might be able to pick up on some nuances that you missed with the seasons stretched out over 6 years. Either way, this show is a classic.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|This season was during the writer's strike so it's shortened but it is absolutely profound. Actually, I think there are more major events in it than in all of the previous seasons put together. There is a heavy emphasis now on the flash forwards which builds more intrigue than the flash backs (there are still some flash backs though).<br /><br />As I've said in previous reviews, this show is like a drug. J.J. Abrams does a masterful job of keeping the intrigue and suspense meter on maximum with more twists and turns than a M. Knight Shyamalan movie. There are some definite unexpected events here that may make you rewind a bit to make sure that you saw what you saw. I repeat what I've written in the reviews of the other seasons, I'm glad that I watched this on DVD after the show ended because I'd go nuts waiting week to week and even more nuts waiting for the new seasons with the season finales.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I will keep it short and simple.  I've lost count of how many times I have bought this album.  First on cassette about 8 times, wore them out or lost them.  Had at least 4 copies on CD.  Listened to it in its entirety at least once a day for several years in a row. One of the most sonically perfect albums ever.  First song I heard by them was Disarm.  and there was no turning back.  If you dont like this album there may be something wrong with you...
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I continue to be glad that I waited until the series was over to get into it. It's been easier to keep track of the little things between the flashbacks and what is currently going on with the survivors and the others. This season is a really big deal for the series and sees some major changes and shifts.<br /><br />There is also the introduction of flash forwards which means you really have to pay extra attention to what's going on. Of course, the season flows with the same suspense as the previous two. Of course, they still don't tell you what the smoke monster is.<br /><br />Again, this show is like crack and of course Season 3 ends with you yelling at the TV to see season 4. Of course, if you waited like I did to see them on DVD, you can pop season 4 right in!
B00382S9V4|2.0|This is a good movie and the blu ray transfer of it is pretty good but what I find unacceptable is that while the majority of the movie plays fine, there are a few spots in the beginning where the video gets sort of choppy and it almost looks like you are watching the movie in a very fast stop motion form.  This can be seen in the beginning of the movie when Pierce is getting out of his limo and walking into the art gallery.  It even continues this way until he sits down at his haystacks painting.  It picks up again a minute later in the scene where the security guards are going over the delivery to the museum.  After this scene the video jutter seems to stop for the rest of the movie.  I have watched a lot of blu ray movies and this is the first blu ray movie where I have experienced this video jutter.  The transfer of a movie to blu ray does not have to be perfect for me to want to own it but the fact that this blu ray suffers from the problems with the video I have described makes me want to throw this disc in the garbage.  I also want to point out that first I bought this blu ray from Amazon and then I rented it from Netflix and both discs had the same problems in the same places in the movie should it is very unlikely that there is some hardware error with my blu ray player.  I think \\"A.Dent\\", who wrote the \\"most helpful critical review\\" on this site summed up this blu rays problems best and I really just wanted to back this person up on their claims.  Movie studios should not release poor quality blu ray movies and then have consumers waste money on these blu ray movies just to make a quick buck.  They should get blu ray transfers right the first time or not release them at all.  Thanks for nothing MGM, maybe in the future you will release a second blu ray transfer of The Thomas Crown Affair that is of good quality and maybe even throw in a few extras in that version.  In sum, don't buy this disc; wait for a better version to come out.
B000001EKX|5.0|Sludgy, dark, and moody, KISS' sophomore album, \\"Hotter Than Hell,\\" is considered one of the group's low points in its early years by many mainstream rock enthusiasts.  However, I personally feel that it is one of their best offerings for a number of reasons.  The first reason is the fact that this album was an attempt to sound more like one of KISS' bombastic live shows.  It's a well-known fact that KISS' popularity didn't really take off until after the release of \\"Alive\\" (two albums later), so you can't fault the producers or the band for trying to catch the raw energy of their live show on a studio album.<br /><br />Secondly, the song collection ranges from typical KISS fare like the title track, \\"Let Me Go, Rock n' Roll,\\" and \\"Mainline,\\" to darker rockers like \\"Parasite\\" and \\"Goin' Blind.\\"  As expected, Paul Stanley shines on the songs that lean more to the pop spectrum of rock n' roll.  Peter Criss takes lead on \\"Mainline\\" and \\"Strange Ways\\" and handles them both in his typical gruff-voiced way.  Gene Simmons leads the bulk of the album, fronting five of the album's ten tracks.  If you've never heard \\"Goin' Blind,\\" I highly recommend it.  It is once of Simmons' best songs.<br /><br />The third reason, and quite possible the biggest reason this album gets better with each listen, is the writing and guitar playing of Ace Frehley.  He penned two of the album's songs, \\"Parasite\\" and \\"Strange Ways,\\" and co-wrote \\"Comin' Home\\" with Paul Stanley.  All three of these tracks are, in my opinion, some of KISS' best early tunes.  Frehley's guitar has rarely sounded better than on this album as well.  The album's sound, particularly the sludginess of many of the songs, seems to lend itself to Frehley.  His solos on this album are wonderful.<br /><br />Overall, this album is often overlooked by casual fans of the group.  You can't really blame them, however, given the large amount of greatest hits packages that the band has offered over the years.  If you're a true KISS fan, you probably already have this album.  If you've been holding off on buying it due to the lack of major singles, you're missing a real treat.  Highly recommended.have this album.

0446607274|5.0|Angels Flight is as good a crime thriller, police procedural as you will ever read. LAPD detective Harry Bosch is called into a highly volitale situation following the murder of Howard Elias, a controversial attorney. This is classic Bosch. Mr. Connelly is by far the best writer of the police procedural and there is not a close second. Harry Bosch is one of the best continuing characters this genre has produced, his subtle complexity grow with each book.<br /><br />Mr. Connelly's prose is first rate. Here is an example: \\"The Bradbury was the dusty jewel of downtown. Built more than a century before, it's beauty was old but still brighter and more enduring than any of the glass-and-marble towers that now dwarfed it like a phalanx of brutish guards surrounding a beautiful child. It's ornate lines and glazed tile surfaces withstood the betrayal of both man and nature.\\" That is pure poetry.<br /><br />Angels Flight is a GREAT READ!! I found it impossible to put down.
B001CQONKY|1.0|I tried twice, but both times the first disk of the season does not play.
0345444051|4.0|This book has some flaws. Let's get them out of the way. The story is separated into parts and each lacks some depth. The characters are not around long enough for you to achieve a good understanding of them. Also, I would have liked much more description of details and setting. Yet, this book does not fail to please. It is written in a very smooth and seamless manner that comfortably brings you from beginning to end. I definitely was in awe of Clarke's ability to write; it transcends my preconception of the range of human ability. But best of all, Clarke not only paints a picture of a possible future, but takes it many steps further in terms of complexity and imagination, beyond anything else I have ever read. Almost all SciFi seems to attribute very human qualities to all beings; for in a sense we are confined by what we know. While some other works present alien beings as the antithesis of us. But this book creates something new that is not comparable to human behavior or qualities. It is almost inconceivable. That's what makes Clarke such a genius. Have your thinking cap on and be ready to imagine new paradigms.
B003L7861E|5.0|The Hundred-Foot Journey covers many miles and many years, and covers it an engaging manner that draws the reader in and doesn't let go. The author fully develops the numerous quirky personalities, allowing the reader to know them, and seamlessly weaves their life stories into one. The richness of the various cultures, from India to France, come across as well fleshed out. The love for food, its preparation, its subtleties and nuances, makes the reader long to be able to sit down at the table and taste a few of the dishes that the book's hero prepares. I had to keep reminding myself that this was a novel, and not a \\"you were there\\" sort of recitation of a true story. I loved every page, and every minute of it.
0061714372|5.0|This book will show you the real power of God to heal someone and change their heart and behaviour. Magnificent testimony of love and forgiveness. It is fulled with sex, drugs and rock 'n roll and is quite grisly and decadent in its unflattering portrayal of the music industry. However, Mustaine wisely thought his life through and said, 'What have I got to lose?' Although this book would have been equally - if not more - effective by withholding some imagery and perhaps having less blasphemy and swearing, it remains transparent and powerful. Perhaps a sequel in a few years showing even further spiritual transformation of Mr. Mustaine is worth hoping for.

While, guess what, after order week ago, it's still not arrived yet. It was qualified for 2-day shipping, now it's a week already and nothing happen. It was marked as priority mail, but no one knows where is the shipment after it left facility on August 16th. I will have to find a way to cancel this order if it's not showing up in next two days, because i will be on my way to Hawaii. Bad experience about shipping!
0679722610|4.0|The 2007 film \\"Shoot Em Up\\" kicks off with an exhilarating 10 minute sequence that finds the movie's lone hero not only battling and killing a half dozen trained killers, but also finds him delivering a baby and cutting the umbilical cord with a well-aimed bullet.  It is a rollercoaster opening and when the credits finally appear, it is with a sigh of relief.  But no- the credits are short and within minutes, not only has the rollercoaster ride resumed, but it is now faster and more dangerous.<br />  Such is the impact of this western style, shoot-em-up detective novel by Hammett.  It starts with blood being spilled, continues with blood being spilled, and ends with blood being spilled. Continental Op detective travels to an on-the-verge of lawlessness town in Montana to help the town boss settle a score, and finds himself in the middle of four or five warring factions all trying settle their own scores.  Lies fly as often as the bullets and not only does the detective have no idea what is going on, but neither do we, other than the fact that any new character that appears after page ten will probably be dead before too long.  Romance, sex, gangsters, arson, jail break-outs, extortion- it's all here and it's all intriguing and it all makes for a book that once picked up, will not be put down easy (unfortunately, the same cannot be said for half the thugs in this classic).

Taking into account that this is an EP, it is still a very well produced disc.

B003N5VOUO|5.0|I was very moved by this film.  I almost don't know what to say about it.  This film is a love story.  It is the story of a simple man who loves the one and the many -  and holds that love in his heart throughout the film.  It is the story of the love of good.  This film is also about what is actually required to make a change in this world.  That thing that we must do is to love - truly love each other.  This film demonstrates that we must do what is driving us in our heart of hearts - that is the good thing that is within us that must be done.  And, we, each of us is the only one who can do it.  When we do that thing  we have in our heart we make an unimaginal impact on the world.<br /><br />I am so grateful for this film in this day and age.  The other reviews have covered most of the points so I won't.  But I ask you, please watch this film.  And as you do, open your heart to the possibility that each of us is part of the other.  ..  That we can connect in a way that may be unusual or different but we can connect.  It is that connection that will bring peace.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|'Shutter Island' is a suspenseful thriller that holds up to films such as 'The Sixth Sense'.  Of course, that should be the very least you get when you put a legendary director like Martin Scorsese on the job.  This is a film that will have you thinking and guessing even after you've left the theater.  An amazing mind trip that takes the viewer into the surreal labyrinthine hell that is Shutter Island in the eyes of  Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels, a U.S. Marshall investigating the strange disappearance of a patient at the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant in the lead role of this film.  It is easily his best performance since 'The Aviator' in 2004.  His performance is one of the most down to earth, believable ones in recent memory.  When he emotes he doesn't downplay or exaggerate for the sake of the film.  He reacts in ways I could easily imagine a real person.  DiCaprio may not have starred in a movie nearly as successful as 'Titanic', but as far as acting is concerned he is 10x the actor he was in 1997.<br /><br />Scorsese is a genius.  That goes without saying it.  Martin Scorsese ranks up with the likes of Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, and Orson Welles as far as influence of cinematic techniques is concerned.  Some were disappointed by Shutter Island, saying that it doesn't live up to Scorsese's reputation.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the directing in this film.<br /><br />The decision of composer and Scorsese-collaborator Robbie Robertson and Scorsese to use only classical music for the film is very Stanley Kubrick, but it also works very well in Shutter Island.  Every piece of music manages to capture the scenes.  It is a marvel how they make these pieces almost seem as if they were written for the film.<br /><br />Make sure to give 'Shutter Island' two viewings, and don't let the first viewing define your view of the film.  You will learn most from the film after two viewings spread out over a period of time.  After seeing this movie for the second time, having thought over the first viewing for a period of six months, the film took on a new dimension of greatness.  Somethings become more clear, while others remain a mystery.<br /><br />Don't write this film off after one viewing.  If you do, you're missing out on the power of Scorsese's fresh masterpiece.r seeing this movie for the second time, having thought over the first viewing for a period of six months, the film took on a new dimension of greatness.

0307454541|2.0|this crime novel constantly commits the signature crime concomitant to bad fiction: it tells, it doesn't show. replete to the eyeballs with exposition, what Blomkvist did when he woke, the coffee he drank, the tedious background information just info-dumped all over the place, the frequent shifts in point-of-view mid-passage. just fiction 101 mistakes. i'm not just being nitpicky. the whole book is poorly written and the decent story poorly executed... it's really tedious and it's really awful. and the cliches. which maybe one can blame on the translation, but this book's so rife with them that that excuse wears thin quickly. the tone-deaf, flat dialogue, the lack of spark in the voice of the prose, the flat drone of the narrative. man.

B000008LD2|4.0|Being a young kid when this CD was released in the UK I remember more the hysteria of my two older sisters and the constant references in the British media of the group. I've never seen a cultural reaction to a group since, it seemed everyone or at least a mass of the British public loved this band and it is mainly due to their struggle to make boyband pop a mainstream in the charts. (Grunge and dance was the scene) TT had many flop singles which are on the album before finally reaching top ten with 'It Only Takes a Minute'/'A Million Love Songs' and the top 3 hit cover of Barry Manillow 'Could It Be Magic' - the moment TT went nationwide and soon to be global.<br /><br />The album is patchy but has a lot of heart, hard work and charisma. Take That definately have the likeability factor and are seen as good, nice, hard working guys. This has one of the ultimate Take That songs 'A Million Love Songs' and of course 'Could It Be Magic'. Other tracks liked were 'It Only Takes a Minute', 'Satisfied', 'I Can Make It', 'Promises', 'Give Good Feeling' and 'Take That and Party'.<br /><br />'Could It Be Magic' also went on to win Best British Single at The Brits (UK Grammys) in 1993.<br /><br />In 1995 controversial British comedian Roy 'Chubby' Brown released an explicit novelty album titled 'Take Fat and Party' a play on this album.<br /><br />Fun Fact: Gary Barlow didn't want to release a cover as he wanted the group to break with one of his original songs. However it was the last chance for the group before potentially being dropped by the record company and 'It Only Takes a Minute' did the job securing their first UK top 10 and the rest is history!#3 / Europe #9 (Rapino Radio Single Mix).
B00008PX8P|5.0|Well worth purchasing and watching.  I rate it 5 stars out of 5 stars.
B000BMPQUG|5.0|This album is amazing and diverse with timeless pop songs. Another huge chart topping album as new fans introduced themselves to the biggest pop band of the 90's in the UK and one in general worldwide outside North America. They have had 19 UK #1's overall.<br />Honestly believe that Take That must be the biggest band from Britain never to have fully made it in America - even more so than Robbie as a solo artist. Had TT been as huge as they were worldwide in the States I believe the US would definately have a different view of pop bands or boybands. Get this album for all the highlights.<br /><br />Take That between 1992 and 1995 won the most trophies in the history of the annual nationally (UK) public voted Smash Hits Poll winners award show both as a band and also individual members. The band also had the most front covers in the history of the magazine (1978 - 2006) the highest selling music magazine aimed at children to young adults in the UK but was also sold in Asia and Australia during Take That's popularity years.<br />Two of the biggest selling issues in the history of the publication were Robbie Williams leaving in 1995 and the band splitting in 1996 which became a dedication issue.<br />The editor at the time has said on numerous occasions that Take That completely revived the magazine after it's huge 80's popularity was now at it's lowest due to the dance/grunge scene at the time and Take That's popularity has been noted as almost solely saving as well as sending the magazine from it's low back to being the #1 magazine again. Even after Take That's departure the magazine continued successfully until 2006 when it became second to the internet for music news and features and ceased publication.<br />In 2003 they won the magazines poll of best boyband of all time beating all the big boybands of the time and despite them not having been in existence for 7 years at that point and with a new generation of readership to the magazine voting.<br /><br />It was also during the years 1993-95 that the band fronted scores of magazine covers ranging from Smash Hits to GQ, becoming mass merchandised on all sorts of paraphernalia ranging from picture books, to posters, stickers, their own dolls, jewellery, caps, T-shirts, toothbrushes and even had their own annuals released.<br />All this due to their popularity and unprecedented and unrivalled chart success led to the BBC reporting them 'As the most popular teen pop sensation in Britain since the '60s and Beatlemania, Take That ruled the U.K. charts during the first half of the '90s. In strict commercial terms, the band sold more records than any English act since the Beatles, though the cultural and musical importance was significantly less substantial.' This comparison was made around the time of 93-94 as Take That were the first act to have four consecutive #1's in a row. The last time this had happened was with The Beatles in 63-64 who also had an initial run of four consecutive singles chart toppers. The media who had dubbed The Beatles the 'Fab Four' at times referred to TT as the 'Famous Five'.<br /><br />Backstreet Boys and N Sync have both said many times they had wanted TT's European success when they started out in 95/96 after witnessing it first hand and also being made aware by management when formed about TT global success outside America. The groups have said TT are their favourite non US boy band. Backstreet Boys radio ad in Asia for their first album released in 1996 after Take That split was 'Forget Take That! Now take this...the Backstreet Boys!'<br /><br />Three out of five of One Direction (Zayn picked NSYNC and Niall said Westlife) when asked who their favourite ever boyband was picked Take That.<br /><br />Fashion designer Gianni Versace was such a fan of the band he personally asked them to help him display his latest collection in Italy in late 1994 and the band also subsequently wore his suits on the cover of their next single release 'Back For Good'.<br/><br />Princess Diana was also a huge fan of the group and went to see them in concert at Wembley Arena in 1994 meeting them backstage also. The group were personally invited by her sons to perform at the 2007 tribute concert alongside new artists and some of Diana's favourite groups.<br /><br />Such was the impact of the band when they split in '96 a press conference was held and help lines were soon set up by the British government working with emotional support organisations to help young girls and teenage girls counselling them. Some who had even threatened suicide and were seen lining streets in tears distressed by the news and didn't know how to cope. The conference was broadcast live on MTV Europe and similar scenes to that in the UK were common across Europe due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the band quitting at the top.<br />Their split also made the 10pm national news in Britain which for a music group had never happened before.<br />An hour long extended version of 'Newsround' a children aimed news programme was issued on the split to rationalise the situation and limit the fallout which included initially a mass truancy of pupils from schools.<br />Journalists have since commented this story was one of the most high profile and memorable celebrity stories of the decade.<br /><br />American Idol judge Simon Cowell famously passed on signing the band early on before the group had a record deal. His three major regrets at not signing all of whom are British were Take That, Spice Girls (Major Global success) and Busted (a pop rock act that scored multiple #1's in Britain in the early to mid noughties).<br />He has said Take That's huge success made him feel sick and was an ever constant reminder especially at the year end record companies music review where their latest pop triumphs and records were celebrated and Cowell at the time was still putting out novelty records.<br />This would in turn inspire him to create the boybands Five then Westlife and ultimately One Direction.<br /><br />'Nobody Else' was also the highest peaking studio album by a Western boyband in Japan until Backstreet Boys 'Black and Blue' album in 2000.<br /><br />The group were also the most photographed group in Europe between 1993-1996.<br /><br />The band won also Best Group and 'Babe' Best Video in 1994 at the first European Music Awards and again in 1995 for Best Live Act having been renowned for their breakdance routines, high energy and creative tour productions.<br /><br />They won Best Show and Best Pop Act in 1993 and Best Pop Act, Show and Album (Everything Changes) in 1994 at the Bravo Otto Awards held in Germany. They won Best Group in 1994 and 1995 at the Goldene Kamera awards also in Germany.<br /><br />In 1994 their album 'Everything Changes' was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize established by the British Phonographic Industry for the best album from the UK or Ireland alongside other nominees including Blur,Pulp,The Prodigy,M People and Paul Weller. Take That and rivals East 17 the year before were the only boybands to date ever to be nominated.<br />The group still also hold the record for most top ten singles (6 with 4 at #1) by a group from an album (Everything Changes) in the UK charts.<br /><br />The groups dominance, talent, popularity and pioneering within their particular music type naturally spawned numerous inferior boybands during the period in Britain and Europe especially however these were based on a lazy and non talented version of the group.<br />One of these groups 'Upside Down' even ripped off the Take That 'Pray' music video and segments of the music for their single 'Never Found a Love Like This Before' released three years after 'Pray' had reached number one in Britain and been a Worldwide global hit.<br /><br />Gary Barlow the lead singer songwriter of the band won 'Songwriter of the Year' in 1993 at the Ivor Novello awards for songwriting and composing. They are presented annually in London by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA). His award was presented to him by his idol Elton John. The band also won in 1994 with 'Pray' picking up Best Contemporary Song, in 1995 'Back For Good' being awarded Song of the Year and 1996 'Never Forget' for most performed work.<br /><br />Take That also went on to win Best British Single in 1993 for 'Could it Be Magic', 1994 for 'Pray' as well as Best Video and in 1996 for 'Back For Good' at The Brits (UK Grammys).<br />The group currently hold the record for most Best Single wins at The Brits, 5 in total including the 3 above and in 2007/8 also. Their 1994 performance medley of Beatles songs was nominated in 2010 for greatest Brits performance of last 30 years alongside 14 other performances over the years. The group won 8 Brit Awards in total during their career.<br /><br />In 1996 US Billboard also awarded Back For Good 'International Hit of the Year' and the track went #1 in over 31 nations.<br /><br />In 2012 to celebrate 60 years of the British Singles Charts The Guardian selected one number one track per year as the best. For 1993 'Pray' was selected with the journalist commenting 'Filled with euphoria, guitar riffs and the boys' echoing vocals, this was Take That at their peak, and rightly kept them at No 1 for four weeks.'<br /><br />In the United States also in 2012 Take That were voted #9 in Billboard magazines poll of Greatest Boy Bands of all Time and E! Channel ranked them #10 in 'Most Awesomest boybands of all time' both lists voted for by US only readers/residents.

0545123283|4.0|Overall, it was a good read. I feel like I spent a lot of time in the middle just following everyone through their lives waiting for something to happen but after reading the ending I see why a lot of that was necessary (and it did have a good ending, though there will be a third book now).<br /><br />At first I thought having 4 different people narrating (Sam, Grace, Isabel, and new character Cole) would be confusing, but it actually ended up working out really well.<br /><br />What I didn't like was that the bulk of the story had a HUGE flaw. I won't say what it is, because it will ruin the entire book, but the logic at the end doesn't take into account the time that Shelby broke into Grace's house in Shiver. That, to me, says that the author didn't quite know her story as well as she should have.<br /><br />I'd recommend this as a light read to anyone wanting to continue on with Shiver, but if you're looking for excitement or a book that is really hard to put down, this series may not be for you.

Some who had even threatened suicide and were seen lining streets in tears distressed by the news and didn't know how to cope. The conference was broadcast live on MTV Europe and similar scenes to that in the UK were common across Europe due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the band quitting at the top.<br />Their split also made the 10pm national news in Britain which for a music group had never happened before.<br />An hour long extended version of 'Newsround' a children aimed news programme was issued on the split to rationalise the situation and limit the fallout which included initially a mass truancy of pupils from schools.<br />Journalists have since commented this story was one of the most high profile and memorable celebrity stories of the decade.<br /><br />'Nobody Else' was also the highest peaking studio album by a Western boyband in Japan until Backstreet Boys 'Black and Blue' album in 2000.<br /><br />The group were also the most photographed group in Europe between 1993-1996.<br /><br />The band won Best Group and 'Babe' Best Video in 1994 at the first European Music Awards and again in 1995 for Best Live Act having been renowned for their breakdance routines, high energy and creative tour productions.<br /><br />They won Best Show and Best Pop Act in 1993 and Best Pop Act, Show and Album (Everything Changes) in 1994 at the Bravo Otto Awards held in Germany.

B003IPC5SO|5.0|After the relatively lukewarm reception of previous studio album [[ASIN:B0015I0HMC X]], it would be sensible for a huge international popstar like Kylie Minogue to go back to what she does best. That is EXACTLY what she does here, and fans all over the world couldn't have asked for a better return to form. Despite being in the business for just about 2 decades now, at this point, it shouldn't be questioned no one does carefree, effortless dance-pop like Kylie Minogue. The weightlessness of \\"Aphrodite\\"'s songs can be forgiven seeing as Kylie pulls it off with her trademark perkiness, sass, and ease. The album won't make you think too hard, but dammit, sometimes you just need to have a great soundtrack for the summer.    Opening track \\"All The Lovers\\" might not just smack you in the face like many big lead singles do, but it reveals the beauty of the album: sleek, chiq, sophisticated gems that will render you breathless if you slowly let them creep under your skin. The album is classic Kylie, but with an updated sound that would fit any dance club or chill lounge atmosphere. Hers is the kind of music that's not offensive, but affectionate and warm, even though it's all bustling under contemporary studio wizardry. For hands-in-the-air pure saccharine rush, you get tracks like \\"Get Outta My Way,\\" \\"Too Much,\\" and fittingly, \\"Put Your Hands Up.\\" Sometimes the tempo gets below 120 bpm on songs like \\"Illusion\\" and \\"Better Than Today,\\" but they too fit in perfectly with the rest of the faster-paced club-lite songs. In fact, even though Kylie covers a respectable range (for a pure dance-pop record) on \\"Aphrodite,\\" executive producer Stuart Price's overseeing of the entire package makes all the songs gel cohesively much more than many of her past albums.    \\"Aphrodite\\" seems to check all the right boxes as a big dance-pop album, but it manages to pull you in for repeated listens with class and dignity. That's something of a commendable charm, especially for a veteran that sounds like she's found herself a new breath of fresh air again. Although different incarnations to her sound are inviting (check out the commercially panned, but ultimately essential  [[ASIN:B00009AQLM Impossible Princess (Spec)]]), no one does dance-pop better than Kylie at her best. \\"Aphrodite\\" ranks among just that.
B001KZBK76|5.0|This album is really good and has the third biggest ever opening week sales in UK chart history behind Oasis and Coldplay showing how loved and respected this pop band is.<br /><br />Love Said It All and Greatest Day and all the other songs. Yes Mark takes lead on a lot of songs and i would have liked more from Howard and Jason although they do get their moment to shine on the album. Think the contrast of vocals between Gary and Mark works really well on Said it all. Once again another album that has sold millions of copies in the UK and is now one of the biggest selling of all time in Britain. The Circus tour to accompany this was amazing and hailed as one of the best live shows by the media.<br /><br />Radio DJ Chris Moyles parodied the albums front cover for his first album 'The Parody Album' released in 2009.<br /><br />Fun Fact: To launch the album's Worldwide release in Paris, the band performed at a lavish nightclub exclusively for the first time in 12 years in the city. The performance included acrobats, trapeze artists, stilt-walkers and jugglers, all in keeping with the circus theme!<br /><br />2.Greatest Day: UK #1, (11th).
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a 41 female, 5'4\\", 146 lbs. I had never been consistent in working out or being active before now. I wanted to write this review after I did this DVD for 30 days straight (finished yesterday). I stayed mostly on level 1. Before I started, I couldn't even do a single modified push-up (on the knees) but after starting the workout I was able to increase that number and I can do 12 modified ones, 3 \\"real\\" ones. I have only lost about 2 pounds but I am so much more toned in the arms, abs, thighs, glutes, etc. Clothes fit better, I feel stronger. So even if I didn't lose pounds, I look like I have (which is what counts anyways!). I think the best thing about the DVD is that it's short enough that I could do it daily and not make excuses about not having enough time. Like Jillian says in the DVD, \\"you're capable of working out and capable of working out hard.\\" I didn't believe that I could get fit until now. Check out the DVD. My friends and I have it, too, and we spur each other on and quote her all the time! \\"Can you just do bicep curls? No you CANNOT!\\" Gonna keep going and do Level 2 more now.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|This album is brilliant and shows TT's creativity to grow and change despite 10 years out of the spotlight. The new direction is brilliant and unbelievably they have gotten even bigger in the UK! Patience went to no 1 across Europe and Shine was another massive hit. This album is great from start to finish and it's nice to hear Jason on Wooden Boat. 2.8 million copies sold in the UK alone so far and in the biggest albums of all time list for Britain. Don't know why this wasn't released in the US or on American Itunes but this is a brilliant record and importantly proved to themselves they could continue without Robbie.  'Rule The World' was featured in the movie 'Stardust' released in 2007 and performed at the 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony during the iconic extinguising of the Olympic flame.  Take That also went on to win British Live Act for the albums tour and Best British Single for Patience in 2007 and Shine the following year in 2008 at The Brits (UK Grammys).  Fun Fact: Starting this new era instead of Gary Barlow having all the song writing credits like previously the whole group is credited regardless of level of contribution to the song writing. First time around due to Gary writing all the songs and royalties he ended up multiple times richer than the other members!  2.Patience: UK #1, (9th) / Europe Hot 100 #1 (2nd), 6.Shine: UK #1, (10th).

1400064287|5.0|Why isn't your idea easily grasped and spreading like wild fire? Why isn't everyone \\"on board\\" and working vigorously to implement it? You've written the proposal, sent the emails, and even given the PowerPoint presentation - so what's wrong? Why haven't minds or behavior changed?<br /><br />In Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath explore and analyze dozens of great campaigns where ideas did spread rapidly and were effective in driving change. From military strategies to the work of Mother Theresa, from the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton to the \\"Jared\\" marketing campaign of Subway sandwiches, the Heath brothers deduce six principles for shaping and communicating ideas so that they are \\"sticky\\" - so that they spread easily and change minds and behavior.<br /><br />The six principles are conveyed using clear and interesting examples, such as those listed above. To bring home the major points, the book also contains several \\"clinics\\" - review exercises of scenarios that require improvement, complete with their suggested answers.<br /><br />Everyone should read this book. Not only will it likely improve your writing and communication style, it's helpful in thinking strategically about that next marketing campaign, proposal, or organizational change. No matter what your idea is, the lessons from this book will greatly help to shape and package it for maximum impact.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|As a whole, I am pleased with purchasing this collection. It is my opinion that this series does an excellent job of keeping the spirit of the original series, while significantly raising the bar for science fiction of its time. Even in 2010, Star Trek: The Next Generation is easily able to compete with other series, whether one is considering science fiction or other genres. I found all to easy to watch entire discs in one sitting, yet only one questionable episode. (\\"Shades of Gray\\", apparently the first clip show in Star Trek) In terms of content, this DVD collection is nothing short of awesome.    However, there are some greivances with the way that this series is packaged. The most annoying \\"feature\\" of this particular collection is the casing it arrives in. For instance, the DVD casing is made of a cheap plastic which is flimsy and easily cracked. The design of the casing also makes it difficult to remove the DVDs safely. The grips that hold each DVD in place are difficult to release, and even if you are extremely careful, it is too easy to end up accidentally scratching the suface the disc you are trying to remove. Oddly enough, the tray that houses the bonus disc does not have this problem, and implements a simple release mechanism seen in modern DVD cases. While the issues associated with storing 49 discs are an important problem to overcome, I feel that low profile DVD cases would have been a better choice here.    Additionally, the DVDs themselves have a few user interface issues. There is either no \\"play all\\" option the disc's menu, or it is very well hidden. It is also worth mentioning that the chapters are not defined consistently: most of the time, the second chapter starts directly after the title clip; however, it will occasionally start well past this point, and will continue to do so for a few episodes. If you are like me and wish to watch the entire series sequentially, this can be annoying, as the title clip can eventually get old.    If you canlive with these things, this collection is a steal at its current price. If you purchase this product, I strongly recommend that you move its discs into a safer container. Be extremely careful when you do this, as I cannot stress enough the ease at which the DVDs can be scratched. Try to avoid any lateral motion if you can; when the DVDs in my collection have been scratched, it has usually been because of this kind of accidental movement.
0316044695|5.0|I'd heard some good reports about this book -- and they were spot on.  A fantastic read.
0545123283|5.0|I recommend that everyone read Linger, as well as its predecessor Shiver, for one reason alone: Maggie Stiefvater's writing. Every sentence that comes out of Maggie's genius brain manages to physically affect me - if the sentence is happy, I feel warm and fuzzy; if it is sad, I actually feel colder and depressed. Maggie could write an entire book about pancakes or alligators and make it seem hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />Linger starts off right where Shiver finished. Spring has almost arrived. Sam is still adjusting to being human all the time and to his role as leader of the wolves without Beck. Grace is thrilled to have Sam with her all the time. But she is troubled by frequent headaches that seem to be turning into something more serious. Sam and Grace have a serious committed relationship - the physical aspects aren't emphasized as much but they are so connected that they seem like one person.<br /><br />The book alternates from the points of view of Grace, Sam, Isabel, and Cole. Isabel played a small role in Shiver and now functions as one of the wolves' helpers and secret-keepers. She is an irritating girl, mean and moody, but I understood why she acted the way she did and really sympathized with her. Cole is a new character, one of the wolves that Beck turned the previous year. He seems like a real jerk - selfish and snarky. But seeing the world through his eyes helped me appreciate his demons. Isabel and Cole are a good break from emo Sam and Grace.<br /><br />I'd say the chief criticism of Linger (and Shiver) is its pace. It is slow - definitely not a page-turner. This didn't really bother me. I expected the pace to be slow, and I love Maggie's lyrical prose so much that I prefer to savor each word. But if you go into Linger expecting the fast pace of most popular YA novels, you will likely be disappointed. I love how Maggie uses poetry in both Shiver and Linger. Shiver had many references to Rilke poems. Linger also quoted Rilke, but I didn't feel as connected to the poetry as I did in Shiver. Linger also features lyrics of songs Sam writes - poetry just as much as Rilke. I dislike the portrayal of Grace's parents. They are stereotypical YA parents - vacillating between absent and overbearing. I understand why they were portrayed this way, but I wish more books were written with good examples of parents.<br /><br />All in all, Linger was everything I expected it to be. I wish I could have a little piece of Maggie's writing every day to treasure. I cannot wait for the third book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 / 5I did in Shiver.

B000063V8R|4.0|The era of Star Trek The Next Generation that its fan base remembers so fondly began around midway through the third season.  The first half of the season was remarkably uneven, with some decent episodes, but many were unbearably slow, like The Defector.  Yesterday's Enterprise is the episode that is commonly cited as the show's turning point, but I would like to give some credit to the episode that preceded it, Q Who.  The god like alien Q is stripped of his powers, leaving him a vulnerable human being.  Q is actually developed for the first time since we met him in Encounter at Farpoint.  This was not the writer's intention, but I believe Q's dependence on his powers is analogous to our dependence on technology.  We see Q's selfless side for the first time, as well as some good Data moments.  Data laughing is one of my favorite scenes ever.<br /><br />The season concluded with The Best of Both Worlds, one of the best cliffhangers in television history and arguably the best episode in the series.  Overall, I think the fourth season is superior because of the third season's weak first half, but this is still the season to start with if you want quality TNG.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. If you scan the reviews here you'll see a bunch of 5 star reviews and a bunch of 1 star reviews. But, as usual, the truth is in the middle.    I actually really loved a great deal of the episodes in this season. There were many highly entertaining and (to me) fascinating entries. I loved first season, and season 6 returned to the slower, character-driven stories that got the show rolling. I loved the dynamic of Jacob and MIB and actually wish this season spent more time on exploring that through time. However, I'd agree that the episode \\"Across the Sea\\" focused on their background had a lot of problems.    In any case, what I'd say is that the creators became fascinated by the sideways time line and spent too much time developing and explaining that, and then didn't spend enough time providing more detail about the island itself, miscalculating (I think) how much should be answered and how much should remain a mystery. In essence, they should have explained the island, BUT left the sideways time line more up for interpretation. That balance would have made me happier, at least.     But, you can't go back and change it. Perhaps some of the bonus material on this DVD set will make the ending more satisfying to a number of fans that enjoyed but didn't completely love season 6.

B0021L8V1Q|2.0|I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!  I don't understand why so many people think this is a good film.  The film that I saw was a very poor sequel to Ironman, which is in no way, shape or form as good as The Dark Knight.  The first ten minutes was cut so tight that the performances felt like they were derived from a trailer.  The original had heart that balanced Tony Stark's narcissistic personality and his scenes with Pepper were cute and amusing to watch.  The scene where his arc generator needs to be replaced is hilarious because it is a life threatening situation but Tony doesn't seem phased at all.  In the sequel, there are very few redeeming scenes, and they seem to have wasted all the budget on extravagant locations and the Stark Expo.<br /><br />The single scene that was somewhat moving is when Tony discovers the message from his father Howard.  And Mickey Rourke's Vanco character could've had a great tie-in to the main plot if he held the key to saving Tony's life.  Instead, he just becomes a de facto villain and we have the \\"Roger Roger\\" bots that obviously are not going to cause any problems apart from a few bullet holes here and there.  Jeff Bridges was a much better villain than Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke put together.  The scene where he gets drunk and gets in a fight with War Machine is quite moronic and juvenile.  And the Avengers cameos are taking away the integrity of the individual films.  Incorporating them after the credits would be fine, but leave the actual films alone Marvel, for christsakes!  Ironman 2 is simply bigger and dumber.

You can see directly from people's reactions during the concert footages, why He was and still called the King indeed. Clear footage and great sound with multiple scenes make this a real winner. No wonder why it had been given Golden Globe Award. I'm 28, also listener of Radiohead, Jeff Buckley and Coldplay but THIS... ELVIS ON TOUR made me cry, scream and enjoy in every second. Elvis was the biggest and he will always be. BUY IT WITHOUT ANY HESITATE.

9889979942|5.0|I'll just state that this book should be used in all American schools as a personal introduction to China, or -- as the author explains -- \\"the 33 provinces of the fourth largest country in the world,\\" which includes \\"56 different ethnicities, each with their own languages, customs and lifestyles.\\"<br /><br />CHINA: Portrait Of A People is an amazing book. No less remarkable for its unpretentiousness. The author and photographer, Tom Carter, is no crusty academic, and what he provides here is a personal (and personable) view: a voyager's log in part and what is essentially a superior example of guerrilla photojournalism. The book is divided into 33 chapters, one for each province, and before each chapter are his recollections of his difficulties traveling to the regions as well as episodes where Chinese individuals (see \\"I, Shen Mei Li,\\" page 134) are allowed to speak for themselves, as well as fragments of poetry and other uniquely Chinese related material -- just enough to wet the appetite for the remarkable images -- some gritty, some even grotesque -- you are about to see.<br /><br />Favorite images, sections? Hard to pick since there are so many. The photo-illustrated journey starts at Beijing ('the epicenter of the \\"center of the world,''' as Tom Carter writes) and concludes with Tibet (\\"Middle of nowhere, center of everywhere\\"). With more than 600 pages in between. (The images in this final section -- Tibet -- are among the most emotionally compelling and beautiful of the book.)<br /><br />With a country as vast as China (and one as culturally and historically ancient), there's a lot to see and Tom Carter provides a vast array of images and views -- glimpses of a country on the cusp of a sweeping transformation: a great nation that still identifies as Communist while embracing new Capitalist ways. These photos then also provide historical artifacts as modernization plows away thousands of years of history.<br /><br />The scope of this book is epic, yet broken down into satisfying sections. So it's user friendly. And again I would mention that the book's lack of pretension and self-conscious artiness lends it a down-to-earth charm. It's like a pilgrim's account of China experienced first hand and shared in photographs. And I found myself fascinated by certain details (the \\"hair salon girls,\\" pgs. 28,169, 331 and the \\"double lucky\\" eyelids/cosmetic procedure), among other things.<br /><br />Of the places I'd like to visit on account of this book, top of the list would be Tibet and places like the Portuguese-influenced Macau, and of course Beijing (\\"Chaoyang\\"). Then: remote Heilongjiang (\\"Harbin\\"), Inner Mongolia (which is one of the most beautiful sections of the book), coastal Shandong (birthplace of Confucius), Jiangsu (with its sad and bloody history of Japanese invasion), Fujian, Guangdong (\\"Dapu\\"), of course Hong Kong (for its urban, multi-cultural variety), Guangxi ( \\"Zhongliu\\"), Guizhou (\\"Zengchong\\"), Anhui (\\"Mukeng Zhuhai,\\" the Bamboo Sea where Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was shot), Hunan (\\"Zhangjiajie\\" and \\"Fenghaung\\"), Henan (\\"Song Shan\\" for its 800-year-old Shaolin temple and its ancient association with Kung Fu), Shaabxu (\\"Xi'an\\" for the Bingmayong vault), Gansu (\\"Hexi\\" and \\"Langmusi\\" for its Tibetan yet almost Peruvian-appearing culture), Sichuan (\\"Jiuzhaigou\\" and \\"Emei Shan\\"), Yunnan (\\"Lijiang\\"), and once again Tibet (particularly \\"Lhasa\\").<br /><br />Need I say more? For the world traveler and romantic in us all, this book will infect you with<br />enthusiasm, excitement, and curiosity for a place. And I can think of no higher praise for a book.<br /><br />CHINA: Portrait Of A People by Tom Carter. Highly recommended.So it's user friendly.

B001NHDP2O|4.0|I am a huge Dark Knight fan mainly because I am obsessed with Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. I needed a good DVD copy of The Dark Knight so I immediately jumped on this cool Best Buy edition box set with the BONUS Joker Bank Robber Mask. The mask is made out of hard plastic and is machine painted. While the mask is not as nice as the Side Show busts that came with the Universal Monsters box set it is still a cool collectible piece to add to your Dark Knight or Joker collection. The set also comes with the Two-Disc Special Edition DVD and a Bonus digital copy of the movie.
B003L20IHO|5.0|This was a movie that we fully expected to find heartbreaking but we weren't at all prepared for the amount of emotion that this movie would promote.  Zac Efron deserves an Emmy for his performance as the broken-hearted, older brother suffering through the loss of his little brother.  He finally finds love and your heart soars when it is returned to him.....when the twist in this movie comes at you, you'll be rocked off of your seat...have plenty of tissues handy and ready your heart to feel love for characters that will, without a doubt, steal your heart.      Charlie St. Cloud is the best movie I have seen in a decade, in that it makes you fall in love and you will take the roller coaster ride of your life...when the ride stops, you'll find yourself pulling for Charlie; that he will be able to live his life to the fullest.

0375413405|4.0|this book is and will most certainly always be, one of my favorite cook books.  Of the handful of recipes I have randomly chosen, all have turned out very well.  While it is a much older book and certain tools and methods therein described may be considered dated by today's standards-I love it!  With just a little bit of prior basic cooking knowledge, this book could easily be anyone's favorite.  A definite tried and true classic.  You must try the potato leek soup!  my husband dubbed it \\"leaky potato,\\" but for a typically \\"meat and potatoes guy\\" he actually loved it, once he was able to overcome the appearance that is.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|As an action film, this one is harder to categorize than I expected.  Despite a lot of violence, it has enough camp to keep it from being a hard core action movie like the Expendables, but it's more than a popcorn flick like the Transporter films.  I agree with another reviewer that it's a smart action film, with a familiar storyline but a non-traditional execution.  A band of special ops is betrayed by superiors and want revenge.  The filmmakers use the graphic novel basis to great effect, giving a very stylized presentation.  The film begins with each of the main characters being introduced - the camera pans to and freezes on their face as their name is stamped on the screen; a similar effect occurs when the location changes. In fact, the camera freezes more than a few times during the film to good effect.<br /><br />The acting is top notch.  Other than Jackie Earl Haley's Rorschach, I thought Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian was the best thing going in \\"The Watchmen.\\"  Here, he's also conflicted but staunchly a \\"good guy.\\"  He was totally believable as the leader of this ragtag band of Losers.  And Chris Evans surprised me - happily, there's more to him than eye candy Johnny Storm characters.  Perhaps the biggest surprise was Zoe Saldana.  It wasn't just seeing her kick a@@, she had to hold her own against an entirely male cast and she did just that.<br /><br />I would have given the film four stars but for one thing, the villain.  Max is a strange contradiction; he's utterly ruthless with no regard for life, but also somewhat comical with a \\"greatest criminal mind of the century\\" mentality.  That was fine for Lex Luther in a film with no visceral violence - but not here.  I'm not sure if it was the actor, or the writing, but he just didn't quite work.  Overall, I think fans of graphic novels-turned films (Sin City, 300, etc), and those looking for a different take on action, will enjoy this.<br /><br />The DVD doesn't offer much in extras.  There's one featurette, \\"Zoe and the Losers,\\" that discusses Saldana's character and how the actress tackled the role and there's a commentary track.  I would have liked a featurette on the graphic novel and how it was adapted, but considering the film didn't do well in theatres I guess it's better than nothing.

B002C6K7N0|3.0|Past 3 albums, albums such as System has Failed, United Abominations and now Endgame are good. You listen to them with anticipation hoping to find something that really makes you say \\"this album is great\\"....yet you never find it.<br /><br />From 1983 to 1999 you could find at least one, usually numerous songs on their cd's that after a few listens you know word for word and that makes the album come alive and have an identity. A memorable one. But not since World Needs a Hero or even Risk can you find one song that stands out amongst these albums that makes you say Wow.<br /><br />You can safely say that the albums are good, but they're missing that certain \\"something\\" that the albums before the year 2000-2002 had.<br /><br />It's good music, they can play, but where is the meaning.. the older songs they put out were Epic, each one, had it's own special sound and were distinctive and coincided with the album.<br /><br />People say Risk is bad, but I can guarentee you remember the songs... Because it was Different.<br /><br />Now it's a continuous wall of sound where each song blurs into the next and lacks what the previous albums had.<br /><br />Yea, it's good but sometimes good isn't enough to impress people when you've put out much better stuff in the past.
B003JTHESA|5.0|Nothing much to say other than i loved the album. Just like i've read in other reviews you have to listen to this album a couple of times not so much for it to grow on you but to admire the effort put into it. One of the things i loved the most about it was that you can really appreciate all three guitarist this time. The songs are beautifully layered and i trully enjoyed the lenght of the songs. Everybody has a unique taste in music and that's why it's so hard to buy an album based on somebody elses opinion on it because at the end of the day is about what you like and not everybody else. I guess i'm lucky because as far as this album goes it was talor made to my taste in music.

The music selection is great and the added bonus interviews really add to the whole event.    I'm blown away!
B003JTHESA|4.0|Iron Maiden has been on a role since Bruce Dickenson's return more than a decade ago, releasing a trio of excellent albums that have lured a new generation of fans. The Final Frontier, their latest - and hopefully not last - album since Maiden 2.0 launched certainly adds to their legacy of being arguably the greatest metal band ever, despite treading the same ground they've been before.<br /><br />The album opens with Satellite 15, one of the most intense, momentum-building intros Iron Maiden has conducted in years, before changing up midway through to the album's signature song and space anthem, \\"The Final Frontier.\\" Next up is \\"El Dorado,\\" which was released months ago and played in Maiden's 2010 world tour, which is another to add to the Iron Maiden favorites playlist. While these are the better songs on the album, and obviously released early to build more buzz, the rest of the album has gems, as well. And within many of those songs are even better guitar solos.<br /><br />If there's anything to criticize, it's that Maiden can be a bit predictable when it comes to music that sounds too much like their other music, particularly \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\" - a good song for sure - but didn't we hear it on their album from four years ago? And like their last album, A Matter of Life and Death, Maiden focuses on writing long, epic songs with Maidenesque titles such as \\"The Alchemist,\\" \\"Isle of Avalon,\\" and \\"The Talisman\\" that tend to bleed together when listening to the album at once.<br /><br />Maiden as of late also tends to write music that listeners might not fully ingest upon their first listen. While this can go for just about anyone, it's easy to go from \\"Huh?\\" to \\"Awesome!\\" once these songs start sticking out on their own and the listener separates the more creative aspects of the music from the routine.<br /><br />Iron Maiden didn't necessarily break new ground with their 15th studio album, but The Final Frontier is relevant and well worth the wait.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|I love the play!! but one of my favorite parts was completely gone!! the part where they are dancing when Galinda gives Elfaba the witch hat as a joke and she ends up dancing with Elfaba and then they all start to dance with them, the start of it is shown the the camera goes down and the the rest of the scene is omited!!!!!  I was VERY dissapointed!! and most of the time all you see is where the face of each actor is a big shining light so you can't see their faces. it was ok BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!!!!!

I assumed (you know what they say) that the rest would be pop treacle. Boy was I wrong!     This album is sweet and spicy and multi-layered. It's jazzy and bluesy and sophisticated and intelligent. Just when you think you know where it's going it takes you in a completely different direction, much better than the one that you anticipated. If you can get through the whole thing without hitting the \\"repeat\\" button, you're not really listening.

B003L20IHO|4.0|This thought provoking movie is certainly worth seeing. It's not without its flaws but the positives outweigh the negatives. The acting by Zac Efron is really superb and he carries the movie. The first time I saw it I was a little confused with some of the details in the storyline, especially when he keeps talking to dead people, but the second time I saw it a lot of things made more sense.  I think you have to be in the right mood to see it and also there are a lot of details that you notice more during the second viewing. I also felt at first that they were playing on Zac Efron's stunning good looks a little too much with their close up camera shots etc., not that I'm exactly complaining, ha ha, but at first I found that distracted from the touching storyline. The main themes of making the best of second chances, and that if God gave you a second chance to live what would you do with it, really do make you think. It's also about moving forward and leaving your past sorrows behind, as well as a subtle message of not taking your loved ones for granted.  The love story is secondary in some ways as the characters struggle to deal with these issues in their lives.<br /><br />Charlie is a father figure to his younger brother Sam as their father abandoned the family. They do everything together and even won a sailing competition as a team. Charlie promises his brother that he will teach him to play baseball and they agree to practice every day at sundown.  Charlie is left with \\"Sam Duty\\" and has to babysit his eleven year old brother when their Mom has to work an extra shift. Charlie tries to sneak away when it's dark and when Sam catches him in the act, he winds up taking Sam with him. Sadly, they are then in a tragic car accident caused by a drunk driver and Charlie is devastated when Sam dies.  The plan is that Charlie will put Sam's baseball glove in the casket at the funeral, but when it comes to it he isn't able to bring himself to do it.  He runs away from the funeral and meets Sam's ghost in the woods.  They continue meet to play catch every night and here comes the crunch when Charlie starts to fall in love.  He is faced with the dilemma of choosing Sam's world or moving forward with his new girlfriend Tess also known as \\"sailor girl\\" who is planning a solo trip around the world.  Charlie works in the graveyard in order to be close to Sam and feels he can't break his promise to his brother.<br /><br />I didn't find this movie predictable, but it contained some inconsistencies or things that may be offensive to some. After the accident Charlie abstains from alcohol and one wonders if this is because of the accident, but later he seems to drink freely.  I found the parts where he sees other ghosts to be a tad confusing at first viewing, but it all made sense later on.  People who have died in the film seem to be in a sort of half-way state when they stay on earth until they are \\"ready\\" to go on to heaven.  It seems in the story that they choose this time themselves, when they are ready to go. Some are ready to go quickly as Charlie's former classmate who went on to war and others are hesitant to go such as Sam because he wants to stay with Charlie. It's not clear where Sam is when  he isn't with Charlie. Sam does not seem to be aware of people who died, but Charlie's friend tells Charlie he will say hi to Sam for him when he decides to go.  Also, the location of the implied love-making scene will be viewed by some as inappropriate even though it is within \\"PG guidelines\\".<br /><br />I like the strong Catholic Christian message in the film and although there is some minimal swearing and a few religious exclamations with God's name, the message that God has a purpose for people's lives comes through clearly.  I also like how the paramedic who saved Charlie's life attributed Charlie's second chance to God's intervention. He wore a St. Jude charm around his neck and later we find out that St. Jude is the Saint for desperate or hopeless causes. Charlie learns through his experiences why God gave him a second chance and he is able to apply this same truth that was passed on to him, allowing a miracle to happen.<br /><br />I'd recommend this film for Zac fans, but also people who want a story to think through things on a deeper level.  The last time I went to see the film, on its last day showing here, I was the only person in the theatre which I hope isn't a bad sign as to the movie's popularity. If so, that would be too bad as it is a good movie even though it's not everyone's \\"cup of tea\\". It's pretty sad in parts, so do make sure you have kleenexes in your pocket so you don't have to use the theatre's serviettes!

B003O85W3A|3.0|My hope is that the group re-masters this album. I have tried to listen to it from first cut to last, as the album demands, but can only get through a few songs at a time. It's hard work. You have to focus on one instrument or voice at a time to pull it out of the muddy mixes, in order to hear, much less enjoy (if that's possible), what any musician is doing. I suspect that too many locations (studios, homes, basements, whatever) were used to record all the tracks, and the only way to get a \\"consistent\\" sound on the recording was to mix it 50/50 with white noise. Go see them live, it's the only way to hear what they intended.    The only way to listen this recording, on further reflection, is really LOUD. If you have tolerant neighbors and NO plans for hearing in your immediate future, play it at concert levels. It sounds just \\"right\\" then.      Earphones and earbuds, BTW won't cut it. What we have here is a live concert album.  Just add bad parking, 10,000 people and some jerk that stands up in front of you for the whole concert.    The Un-staged concert sounds slightly better in sound quality, but the song sequencing on the CD is epic.    Arcade Fire has given me what I've always wanted: - the live concert version of new music, when the \\"studio version\\" comes out. The downside is you can't listen to it this loud 3 times a day, which I guarantee you will want to do. I don't know whether to bitch or high-five...

B0007CNXUU|4.0|It's 1903, and James M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) has just had a play flop resoundingly on the stage.  Anyone else might be crushed, but Barrie immediately sets out to write a new one.  While engrossed in this project, he unexpectedly encounters the four Llewellyn-Davies boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Peter (Freddie Highmore), and Michael (Luke Spill), whose mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet) was recently left a widow \\"with hardly a penny\\" (though she and her sons seem to live well enough).  A bond immediately forms between him and the boys--except for Peter, who has been left embittered by his father's death and unwilling to believe in anything, especially if it smells of fantasy--and he soon becomes \\"Uncle Jim,\\" playing with the quartet and even lending the family his summer cottage.  Though the supposed relationship with Sylvia causes something of a scandal and alienates his wife (Radha Mitchell), Barrie finds himself inspired by it and writes a new play of a kind never seen before: the story of a boy who never grows up.    Depp's Barrie is a delightful \\"boy-man\\" with more than a touch of Captain Jack Sparrow about him (it's intriguing that he would have been cast as the creator of one of the best-known pirates in English literature), and the developing love of the four boys for this substitute father, plus the growing strain on his own marriage, is excellently done by all parties involved.  Dustin Hoffman appears as theatrical impresario Daniel Frohman, who's dubious about \\"Peter Pan\\" at first but takes the risk and, of course, finds he has an unprecedented hit on his hands.  This is a story about the importance of imagination and fantasy--and of balancing them with an awareness of reality.
0061743526|5.0|With all the superfluous materials filling bookshelves accross the world, its great to see a work like this celebrated.  Timeless classics are called that for a reason, and this one is at the top of my list.  This is the only book Harper Lee wrote, as if she collected all her talent and wisdom and poured it into one novel.  Telling the story from a little girls point of view, albeit a prodigy of a girl, was a stroke of genious.  Reading this book is an enriching experience, not just an entertaining passage of time. If a person had only 5 choices of literature to read, this would have to be one of them. (Add to this The Bible, something from Shakespeare, and 4th and 5th place are tied by a dozen other books:)

6305511055|4.0|Three Days of the Condor is a simple story. Secret agent bookworm comes back to his HQ to find everyone dead. A hit that was supposed to get him as well. He quickly discovers that it's his own government out to get him. So what does he do? He kidnaps a beautiful woman and forces her to help him, who quickly falls in love with him, as he tries to figure this one out. That's the basic story. What's missing is the bigger picture. The movie starts off to abruptly that it takes a while before we get a clear picture of just who Redword's character (Condor) is, what he does, and why this is significant.     The movie's saving grace, ironically, is the assassin who is sent to kill Condor. It is his view on the situation, and Condor, that really makes this an interesting movie. If only Redford wasn't a real life communist he'd make some exceptional spy thrillers.

0783225857|5.0|What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  Gregory Peck offers what may be his definitive role (he won the Best-Actor Oscar for it after four fruitless nominations) and, perhaps, the most famous dad in film; as various critics have said, not even Peck himself was as good a father as Atticus Finch, but Atticus is probably what every dad wants to be.  Though slow in pace, the movie is never boring, and the picture it presents of the Deep South (Maycomb Co., Ala.) in the days before Martin Luther King is both fascinating and disturbing.  If, like me, you find yourself puzzled over why the Ewells faked a rape and accused Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) of the crime, your best bet is to read the book [[ASIN:B000BKACO8 To Kill a Mockingbird]], which also provides a lot of background about the Finches and their neighbors.  Robert Duvall, today one of our most respected actors, makes his first credited big-screen appearance (with never a word of dialogue) as \\"Boo\\" Radley, the mysterious and believed-insane neighbor of the Finches.  This is a movie every child should see and every adult should know.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Diminutive Lisbeth Salander (not even five feet tall and less than ninety pounds) has had a tough life, and it just keeps getting tougher. Even on the lam she runs across a nasty bastard intent on murdering his wife for her money. Lisbeth might be small but watch out, she's a wildcat; resourceful too. She could be a super-hero for battered wives everywhere. If not for managing to pilfer a fortune from unscrupulous villains she'd be a poor little orphan girl, even if she is technically a young woman. I feel for Lisbeth, and love the story except that nobody in it seems to be in a normal relationship. None are faithful lovers! I understand why Lisbeth is screwed up, but what's with the rest of these people? And it isn't just the men, although Lisbeth takes a lesbian lover, I think, because she understandably doesn't trust any men remotely her age. Of course I kept reading anyway. I had to know what happens to her. There was a minor technical problem that I must point out: A Colt .45 Magnum revolver? I don't think so. I'd believe .44 Magnum, though. And did the Swedish detectives really think someone of Lisbeth's stature could be proficient firing such a weapon? They kick like mules! Even Dirty Harry shot .44 Special ammo in his because of that reason. Aside from that, Lisbeth needs to buy her own Harley. I'm thinking, since she's so short, a Softail Deluxe. No! Make it a Fat Boy Lo. I can picture Lisbeth straddling a fat boy.

It had a nice premise (from reading the back of the audio book package), but it took forever to develop the plot.  It was so bad that I actually made my commuting worse.

Frankly this CD is boring, A couple of outstanding tunes but the rest is Al J & Bobby Mac-F est! Jazz didn't start yesterday never forget the roots more standards would have served up well! For all she's got she can't reinvent the wheel! The wounds of a lover are \\"Faithful\\"!
0613657578|1.0|Comments ONLY pertain to School-Library Binding-    An insulting and wretched edition of a splendid book. For one thing, the cover art is different than that shown. This wouldn't be so bad unless, like me, you're trying to match cover styles for a gift- you see the cover, read 'library binding', and recall what the book at the library looks and feels like, not to mention its physical size. Yep, just what you wanted.    Then this this fragrant little turd shows up. Turns out 'School-Library Binding'  doesn't mean a durable, well-made book printed on nice stock and a pleasure to hold and read. It really means, 'cheap nasty mass market paperback with flimsy, glossy hard covers slapped on and no dust jacket'. Who knew?  It's even the same size as a mass market paperback, but the hard cover destroys a paperback's ability to fairly easily tuck into a pocket.    Perhaps I should have read the description a bit more carefully, but I had seen and purchased the version pictured before, so it just never occurred to me. Also, I have yet to see something this awful on a library shelf that doesn't have a paper cover instead of the chintzy cardboard. If you 'look inside!', you do get a warning that this is a different edition. But no visual reference as to what it truly looks like. I had no need look inside, since I knew the book already.    Had I any idea that travesties like this existed, you can bet that I'd have never ordered. This isn't a book-it's a cruel hoax. Mr. Pratchett's incandescent words deserve better. I ordered this embarrassment for a friend's birthday. She also deserves better.    That said, it's a helluva tale. Being Pratchett, though, that's pretty much a given. Zero stars for the edition, ten for the writing.    Speaking of fragrant, it smells bad, too-like bargain basement newsprint. Epic fail as a physical book. It's already packed up for return.
B00139W3NE|5.0|Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) is an orphan (or so she has always supposed) being reared and schooled at Oxford's Jordan College in a world where the technology is mostly late-Victorian, the clothing roughly 1920's, and the composition of human beings unique unto itself--each person has a \\"daemon,\\" an incarnation of his or her soul and conscience that assumes the form of an animal (and for the first 10 or 15 years can switch between shapes at will--Lyra's Pantalaimon, known as \\"Pan,\\" usually appears as a ferret, but he can also be a moth or a wildcat).  The brightest spots in her life are the occasional visits of her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), a noted explorer, whose life she saves when the college's senior faculty set him up to be poisoned.  She hopes that this action will inspire him to take her along on his next expedition, but this he refuses to do.  Sullen and disappointed, she's easy prey for the glamorous Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who invites her to become a sort of apprentice and assistant but turns out to have an agenda of her own, which includes acquiring the alethiometer (the \\"golden compass\\" of the title) that Lyra has inexplixcably been given by one of the professors.  Delivered from sinister kidnappers by a band of \\"gyptians\\" (apparently her world's analogue of gypsies), Lyra finds herself going north after all, and turning out to be an indispensable linchpin in the search for many missing children (gyptian and otherwise), with allies who are an odd assortment of human (Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby, an aeronaut whose natal Texas seems to have retained her independence in this reality), sentient animal (Ian McKellan as Iorek Byrnison, the exiled heir to the kingship of the giant ice-bears), and possibly slightly miraculous (Eva Green as Serafina Pekkala, a leader of the airborne, bow-wielding witches).  Full of twists, turns, and unexpected revelations, the script closely follows the original book [[ASIN:0375838309 The Golden Compass, Deluxe 10th Anniversary Edition (His Dark Materials, Book 1)(Rough-cut)]], though you should read the latter for a better picture of Lyra's society, and is full of splendid special effects, suspense, and adventure, capped by a ferocious battle between Iorek and the usurping Ragnar Sturlusson (Ian McShane) and a wild confrontation (in Arctic night) between the gyptians and the witches on one side and the kidnappers and their Tartar allies on the other.  It also stops a bit short of the book, so if you've already read the latter you should be prepared for that fact.    A sequel is supposedly in the works, though delayed by the economy; 99% of voters on Squidoo support its immediate continuation.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The back pack is a great item for its price. The waist strap allows for good balance while walking. I was able to fit all my gear in it that would not fit into my 1500 p*&^can (fill in the blanks) hard case. I am very pleased with the product. It has ample pockets to fit all kinds of accessories needed when out and about for any type of photo op. I have recommended this product to a friend the night I got it and showed it to him. He also agreed with it being a good product for its price. He also said he was going to get one. The mere fact that it came with a tripod strap with the price you pay is very nice. I looked at quite a few back packs before deciding on this one. The deciding factor for me to make the purchase was seeing the video posted in the reviews of this product. When you are done reading this review then check out the video, you will see what I saw. Purchase and enjoy you will not be disappointed.
0767817478|2.0|If Toho Pictures didn't sue the clowns responsible for this travesty, they should have!   How dare they desecrate the memory of the truly class \\"Godzilla\\", 1954.  The tripe isn't worthy to clean Godzilla's sandbox!  While is was promising in the early going, so-called \\"Godzilla\\" dissolves into a mindless maze of bad acting, retarded dialogue, and a title character who in no way resembles the classic we know and love.  This new and improved \\"Godzilla\\" is just way too acrobatic to be believable.  What's with the sprint around NYC with helicopters in pursuit who can't keep up?  what the hay?  What happened to to slow, lumbering apparition who frightened me as a child and who still remains my favorite sci-fi creature flic?  Matthew Broderick!  OMG!!  What were they thinking?  Knock-offs like this should be illegal when they carry the name of something far out of their league.

0198326769|3.0|I read somewhere that the author wrote the first draft of this book in a sustained blast - two or three days. I read it even more quickly - in the queue for a delayed Easyjet flight from Bilbao to London. It is that type of story. It is not a bad book - based on an ingenious and powerful narrative device which executed which grips at the end with formidable power. But it is unlikely to go down as a classic of children's literature as it it is rather contrived, with unrealistic characterisation. Would Nazi children really be so innocent and whimsically naive about the Holocaust? Unlikely. The reality was somewhat more complex with Nazi education calculated to brainwash the nation's youth into anti-semitic prejudice.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|Many critics seem to think this neon-bright movie overdone, but I found it exciting, fast-moving, and not at all difficult to follow.  Based upon the early \\"Japanimation\\" TV series [[ASIN:B001D11A6I Speed Racer: The Complete Classic Series Collection]], one of the first examples of anime ever to be seen in the U.S., it's the story of a family that overcomes loss, corporate shenanigans, and the limitations of time and flesh to ultimately come home in triumph.  Young Speed (Emile Hirsch) is the son of independent race-car designer Pops Racer (John Goodman) and his wife (Sisan Sarandon); he grew up idolizing his older brother Rex (Scott Porter), who was supposedly killed in a racing accident some 10 years ago, and never wanted anything but to be just as good a driver himself.  When a wealthy industrialist (Roger Allam) whose fuel cells drive every car, plane, and helicopter in the world offers him a tempting package to race exclusively for his stable, Speed hesitates, but in the end he realizes he has to stay independent, as his father and brother did.  With the help of his parents, their mechanic Sparky (Kick Gurry), his food-loving little brother Spritle (Paulie Litt), the mysterious Racer X (Matthew Fox) who he suspects may be Rex, and his girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci), a daring helicopter pilot, he takes part first in a gruelling team road race, then in a defining \\"stunt\\" race where all bets, and gloves, are off as the unscrupulous Royalton angles for the wealth and power that his team's victory will bring him.  Dazzling special effects, imaginative cars, nasty villains (there are some scary bits), and the leavening effect of family love and loyalty blend into a strangely satisfying whole that kids should find entrancing and even grownups may like more than they thought they would.
0060557818|5.0|Darkly whimsical perfectly describes the mood set in this book, especially when you are crossing the line between the real world and the shadow world lying beneath the surface.<br /><br />If you've ever been to London, or any major city for that fact, you've more than likely traveled in that city's underground.  But what if there was a world, a very real world, underneath that. The true \\"Underground.\\" A world completely unlike the one you know, where the rules of physics and biology don't necessarily apply.<br /><br />Richard Mayhew is young man living an ordinary life, with a good job, a \\"good\\" girlfriend, and a good heart. It is his good heart that drives him to help a bloody, strange and oddly regal girl named Door. By helping Door, Richard finds himself unknowingly entering the Underground, where their  allies are the marquis de Carabas and Hunter and their enemies are Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, two of the most ghastly and other-worldly villains in that world.<br /><br />Soon, Richard's life as he knows it doesn't exist anymore.  He walks among the world, completely unseen by those around him. Knowing he must find Door, Richard makes his way literally into Underground, into a world he still doesn't fully believe exist. Trials and tribulations abound as he accompanies Door on her mission to find who murdered her family, all so he can return to the world he left behind. From the Rat-Speakers to a manor where tragedy occurred, to floating markets and finding the Blackfriars, and from an angelic home to a hellish cavernous maze (to name a few). Friends come and go, heroes are made and broken, and answers are found.<br /><br />Go along for the journey as you fall through the cracks into a horridly fantastic dark world where you never know what is around the next shadowy corner...

B001NB1JVY|2.0|\\"The Best of U2\\" in the 11 years from 1990-2000.... weird. This CD is revisionist history, to be sure. The 1990s for U2 were largely about lavish productions & the incorporation of electronic beats, an era which ended before \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\". Yet that album is lumped in with Achtung/Zooropa/Pop-era material... I know it's all U2 technically, but it's weird to see these phases packaged together in such a random fashion.     Also, there are some puzzling omissions as well as questionable inclusions. The inventive, fun single \\"Lemon\\" (from Zooropa) is left out, while \\"The First Time\\" (easily the worst song on that same album) is included. Why? Even more confounding is why \\"Please\\" (arguably the strongest song on Pop), which was a single and seemed to be a favorite of the band themselves, is not here, nor is \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" (these were not on U218, the \\"singles\\" collection, either). And yet we get a song from Passengers (\\"Miss Sarajevo\\"), which isn't really even a U2 song officially. Huh?     Lastly, all songs from Pop, plus \\"Hold Me, Kiss Me...\\" (from Batman Forever soundtrack) are remixed, apologetically removing their \\"electronic\\" elements so they sound more like real Rock Songs, apparently. The original versions of \\"Gone\\" and \\"Hold Me...\\" were far better. I don't understand the need to fix what wasn't broken.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|Ray LaMontagne has established himself as one of the best artists of this generation with this album.  With all the teen-pop, Disney channel cr*p that passes for music now, it's comforting to know that there are still artists like Ray who still care about their music.    Great observation in an earlier review- this isn't the gritty, husky Ray from Till the Sun Turns Black.  Ray's voice is clear, strong and even more full of the emotion that his fans have come to love.  For someone who hasn't listened to Ray before and is thinking of getting this album, listen to the samples of \\"Are We Really Through\\" and \\"God Willin\\".  Word of caution- after you buy this album, you'll want to get the rest of Ray's albums.  Don't hesitate though, your faith in this generation's music will be restored.

0156030306|4.0|Among the elements of life we most often take for granted, the most provocative might the ability to think, reason, and comprehend the life around us.  Flowers for Algernon touches upon this idea in the form of Charlie Gordon, a mentally challenged 33 year-old who became the recipient of brain surgery to improve his intelligence.  Finding his aptitude eventually surpasses that of even his doctors, Charlie is lead to a state where he contemplates the deep implications of his own operation.<br /><br />Daniel Keyes has produced an intriguing journey that captures hearts by instilling readers with a sense of intimate compassion and understanding for Charlie.  The emotional appeal combined with the intrigue of Charlie's development results in an exceptionally absorbing story that is difficult to put down from start to finish.

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Final Fantasy VII:Advent Children, for those of you who don't know, continues the story that began in Final Fantasy VII(a roleplaying game on the original Playstation). It takes place two years after the events of the game and set in a new city called Edge. Two years since Cloud Strife defeated Sephiroth, who summoned a meteor that attempted to devastate the planet, but only destroyed the city of Midgar. It focuses on Cloud who is a delivery boy now living alongside Tifa Lockhart and taking care of two kids. Cloud is summoned to find the cause of \\"Geostigma\\", a disease that's dangerous to the city's population. At first, he refuses. Yet, eventually comes around.  A trio of brothers arrives with what appears to be a cure for the stigma, but they conceal a more sinister plot. That plot is to revive Sephiroth and bring about the end of the world. Before long, Cloud picks up arms(or should I say, sword) and heads into battle to stop the brothers. That's how it all starts to come to a frenetic finish.<br /><br />Do you have to have played and know the game on which it's based in order to understand what's going on in the movie, as mentioned in the editorial review? The answer ot that is,at least in my humble opinion, yes and no. Course, not dissing FF7(mind you), its' story is pretty out there...if you've played, practically, every game in the series. Wait, scratch that....it's story is(ahem) complex. Lol. At any rate, like the editorial review said, it does help(although you really don't need it). Those who hadn't played the game probably won't show much interest in the movie but they'd be missing a good...nay, great Sci-fi movie.<br /><br />What do I think of the movie?  It's absolutely stunning. Way better than Final Fantasy:The Spirits Within, for sure. The action will, definitely, keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />It worth adding to your collection whether you're a gamer or a Sci-fi fan. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />However, I don't understand why Square didn't decide to make this story into a game. Fans have been clamoring for more Cloud since they finished FF7 years ago. That's pretty evident considering how they've been pushing Square to 'remake' FF7 on our current console systems. I imagine there's alot of people saying the same thing I am. Yet, I'm satisfied with what we've received from Square.<br /><br />Gripe? Not a one. If you read most of my reviews, you know that hardly ever happens. I usually got one gripe. Alas, I have none.<br /><br />Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children rules.s story into a game. Fans have been clamoring for more Cloud since they finished FF7 years ago.

B001TODCII|3.0|Taken is an easy movie to watch, and it passes quickly at only an hour and a half. The plot of the story has already been discussed, so suffice to say that it isn't at all a realistic movie. It isn't really believable that a man in his fifties will outfight dozens and dozens of armed, young men, no matter how well trained he is. Especially considering that at many points in the movie, the bad guys have clear shots at him, yet inexplicably miss.    There are logic gaps everywhere. For example, in the scene where Neeson visits the home of his friend the chief inspector of French Police (or whoever he is), the friend sneaks a gun to the dinner table and tries to kill Neeson, who had earlier emptied the gun of its bullets. What was to prevent the man from checking his gun to see if it had any bullets in it, before coming to the table?    Silly risk. Anyway...    If the movie were done with a tongue-in-cheek, self aware attitude it might be more fun. The insertion of techno music during action sequences (the sort of action sequence where Neeson looses five or six rounds and kills five or six men, and those same men miss Neeson with one million sub-machinegun bullets) seems to indicate that this is that sort of picture.    However, the movie seems to take itself too seriously. How come Neeson kills five billion (maybe fewer, whatever) people but doesn't have to face any cops for what he did?    Was his daughter emotionally scarred at all from all of this? She seemed pretty okay at the end of the film, even though it all happened recently (her dad's arm was still in a cast). Then it's implied she will become a professional pop star. I guess as a reward for being spoiled her whole life and ignoring her father's warnings.    I wonder if she cared that her \\"best friend\\" died horribly of a drug overdose while being abused by thugs.    But never mind, she will be a pro singer.    Hey, why did Neeson shoot the French guy's wife? Oh yes, to prove he meant business! He really wanted his daughter back!    \\"Hey, I'll murder your wife, your kids, and then you, mister. My kid's life is the only thing that's important!\\"    Lots of random, innocent slobs get killed, too. Like some party security guy watching an elevator, or a guy carrying champagne. Probably just earning a salary and waiting for the clock to indicate it's time to go home to their apartment and maybe play a DVD and relax.    But NO! They got in Neeson's way, so NECK-SNAP!    That's the trouble with this movie. We're supposed to believe that Neeson is the good guy, but he's selfish. He kills people who may not even be evil, just to accomplish his goal.    But at least he did accomplish his goal. Hey, he DID call the police about all those girls he found, being used as prostitute slaves, didn't he? He DID, right?    No? Well how about his daughter's dead friend's cousins? What did they think about their relative dying horribly?    Who cares! Neeson's kid will be a pop star.

I like the cover art, although for my taste, I prefer a more papery feeling cover as opposed to the slick laminated style.

B003BVK36Q|2.0|This is my first Le Carre. It may well be my last. I am always interested to see how elderly writers will deal with the behavior of young characters. Will the dialog seem right? Will the mores fit? Maybe Germany is a different world, but I think not. I laughed out loud when Annabel proposed to take her CASSETTE player for the purpose of playing classical music for the entertainment of her fugitive Russian/Chechen client. A cassette player? Really? And then, to top it off, our 30-ish heroine scoffs at the idea of an iPod. I'm cheap and I owned a great many tapes in ye olden times, but I haven't bought one since the early 90s and I disposed of the last distorted, warped one almost a decade ago. I would like a show of hands of all the people out there who own a tape player. Yeah. No one. Certainly no one in their early 30s. The classical music trope is another thing that absolutely kills me. As I said, maybe Germany is another world, but I think not. If I read another novel where the character - usually a rumpled police detective, but in our case a lefty, do-gooder lawyer - adores classical music as a way to communicate some sort of sophistication, I will begin burning books.      Why on earth does our smart, savvy lawyer begin to have sad, lovey feelings for the insane Russian/Chechen, an annoying manboy who repeatedly insults her, asks stupidly intrusive and infantilizing questions, disregards her advice, and has no redeemable features? It's not the sense of humor or the intellectual capacity, for sure. Why does Brue immediately fall for our allegedly smart, savvy lawyer, who is in reality neither smart nor savvy? (An example here: Annabel becomes aware THROUGH AN INTERROGATION that the security services observed a meeting and followed her from it. She continues to visit her secreted fugitive, secreted I will add in an apartment she either owns or leases, and make calls on her own cell phone concerning him.) Why are all the spies except for Bachmann heavy-handed morons? Why does this book make me want to scream?    I appreciate the topic. Extraordinary rendition, the incompetence of the American intelligence system, the implicit and explicit criticism of the Bush administration and its policies. All things that could be addressed in a good spy novel. This is not one. Reading this immediately after William Gibson's Spook Country, which was good, although not great, merely highlights the incredible crappiness of A Most Wanted Man.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|So, here we come to my review for Madonna's most recent studio album, 2008's \\"Hard Candy.\\" After 2005's \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" Madonna once again did a complete 180 with this album. She teamed with hit-makers Timbaland, Pharrell Williams, and Justin Timberlake to make a hip-hop influenced album. The results are unfortunately mixed. Don't get me wrong, the album is good. But it could have been so much better in my opinion. Madonna is a good songwriter, so it makes lyrics like \\"See my booty get down like...\\" kind of painful to hear. The production is overall good, but it could have been  better, in my opinion. It's hard to shake the feeling of \\"this album has been done before by other artists.\\" I've never said that about a Madonna album before. Songs like \\"Candy Shop\\" feel a little bit unfinished. \\"Incredible\\" and \\"Spanish Lesson\\" are just embarrassing. As a Madonna fan, it hurts a little to write that. Now, the album is not all bad. I really like \\"Give It 2 Me,\\" \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"She's Not Me,\\" \\"Beat Goes On,\\" and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You.\\" Those are five star songs in my opinion. I even like \\"4 Minutes,\\" and think it was a very good choice for the first single. The good outweighs the bad here, and this is a good album, it just doesn't feel like a Madonna album to me. I recommend this to fans of Madonna  as well as fans of Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams, and those who enjoy this type of dance hip-hop music. Others, maybe listen to Amazon's audio samples first.     1. Candy Shop: This song is okay, it just feels a bit unfinished. I like what Madonna was going for lyrically, it just isn't quite there. (3/5)    2.4 Minutes: I honestly really like this song. I think Madonna and Justin Timberlake work well together here. (4/5)    3. Give It 2 Me: This is just a really fun, really enjoyable song. The best song on the album, in my opinion. (5/5)    4. Heartbeat: This song is merely okay at best. Like I said, the lyric \\"See my booty get down like....\\" is just embarrassing. Come on, Madonna, you can do better! (3/5)    5. Miles Away: I really love this song. It is very well written, and Madonna sounds great singing it. (5/5)    6. She's Not Me: I think the melody for this song is fantastic, and Madonna puts a lot of attitude into this song. I love it! The \\"Sticky & Sweet Tour\\" version is even better. (5/5)    7. Incredible: Yuck. I hate this song. It goes on for way too long, and the lyrics are mediocre at best. (1.5/5)    8. Beat Goes On: Now this is more like it! The beat is fantastic. Kanye West makes a cameo here, and he actually does a good job as well. (5/5)    9. Dance 2Nite: I actually really enjoy this song, and find it to be very catchy. (4.5/5)    10. Spanish Lesson: I hate this song too. This sounds like it's trying to be \\"La Isla Bonita Part II\\" or something. It just doesn't work, and sounds kinda cheap. Sorry Madonna, I just don't like this song at all. (1.5/5)    11. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You: This is a really great song, and I like it a lot. The lyrics are really good. (5/5)    12. Voices: This is a pretty good song to close the album. Not great, but it's not that bad either. (3.5/5)    Overall: (3.83/5) (Rounded up to four stars. I feel generous, I suppose.)
B003VB5D84|5.0|I was at the Crossroads 2010 show and eagerly awaited the theatrical release. The first thing you have to realize is that nothing, not a 2 hour movie or a 4 hour DVD will capture what it was like to have actually seen some of the brilliant performances of that day. The editing was shaky at best but the sound was quite good (I'm sure the sound varied greatly depending on the theater). Although I was dissapointed in the movie, I'd see it again and here's why. The movie missed a lot of the high points of the 11 hour show, but it caught enough to remind me of how great the entire experience had been, and that's all I asked for. I was pleasently surprised at the applause in the theater after some of the better performances. The most dissapointing thing about the movie was the performances that weren't included. John Mayer, Buddy Guy, and Jeff Beck all played sets that deserved complete coverage (and I would pay money to buy a DVD). \\"Going Down\\", \\"Killing Floor\\", \\"La Grange\\", \\"Mystery Train\\", and \\"Comin' Home\\" were all songs I was sad didn't make the cut. And although he didn't add a whole lot musically, Bill Murray's intro's were hysterical. Addressing a negative critism: I don't know what a \\"I-IV-V progression in G with a capo\\" is, but I could watch Robert Randolph, Jimmie Vaughn, and Hubert Sumlin play it all day!(I've seen a lot of pictures of Muddy Waters with a capo and I heard he's pretty good!). I'm quite sure the DVD will capture more of the esscence of the complete concert, but, as we all know, that's impossible.

B002NPY7E0|4.0|This is a great movie. In my opinion Underrated at the time it was released. The Blue Ray disc has a kind of 3D quality that takes away from the film look, but that could be the settings on my TV. The sound quality is very good.
0679720200|1.0|Aside from high-school reading lists, there is no rational reason whatsoever to read this self-indulgent piece of \\"existentialist\\", um, stuff. Requiring people under the age of 18 to read this nonsense should be treated as child abuse, and prosecuted accordingly.    That having been said, adults who want to bore themselves needlessly should consider this a top pick.    My suggestion is that interested parties should read Dostoevsky instead.

1601251831|4.0|Overall, I like the Pathfinder Bestiary. Paizo puts out fairly solid products. I think they may be a bit on the expensive personally, but we can thank Amazon for putting it more in line with my price range.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Updated version of what I consider the real updated version of D&D<br />Well laid out book no random appendixes for bugs and animals, everything is where it logically should be<br />tags for region and when you'd see the monsters<br />a well written monster creation area<br />easy to adjust CRs on the fly with their handy templates and they makes sense<br /><br />Cons:<br />You don't get my favorite creep the heck out of me monsters the beholders or mind flayers. intellectual property issues. (though you could \\"steal\\" them from your Monster manual from 3.5 and convert them to pathfinder manually.)<br />There isn't a lot on ecology, but this may be intentional since this book is supposed to be generic.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I was fully prepared to dislike this movie since my only reason for watching it was Jensen Ackles. Shallow I know but I'm a Supernatural fan and I even watched 'Devour' which was horrible. To be honest I wasn't very optimistic since my last animated Batman was 'Batman-the animated series' and I'm an anime fan, meaning I dislike the animation style of most american productions.    BUT I LOVED IT!  The animation: There were a few car chases which looked too simplistic and too computer clean but the rest was a joy to watch. The fight scenes were impressive, my favorite one was definitely the Red Hood against the four asassins, the character desgin was great and the overall atmosphere was very dark and moody. It's a shame that they didn't go beyond a PG-13 release and did a more bloody, realistic death scene but you definitely get the feeling that they were trying to include as much blood as possible.    The voices: I didn't watch anything besides 'Batman - the animated series' so it didn't bother me that they had different voice actors for this Batman movie. I liked Batman's voice, LOVED the Joker's and the Red Hood's and although he played a very very minor part,I loved Nightwing, he had just the right amount of ligtness and humor to counter the darkness of Batman and the Red Hood.    I liked this movie so much that I finaly dared to watch other DC/WB movies like 'Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths' (Great animation but horrible voices for Batman and Superman), 'Superman/Batman: Public enemies' (great voices but horrible animation) and 'Batman/Superman World's Finest' (great voices and good animation). I have to admit that 'The Red Hood' is my clear favorite since it did a great job with the animation and the voice acting.    So please more Batman movies like this one!
0143036556|3.0|In order to survive and to thrive, communities must balance openness with closeness; openness is a willingness to face the challenges of the outside world (rival nations, the environment, etc.) and the conflicts within, and closeness is a stubborn blind faith in tradition, custom, and direction that ties the community together.  Too much openness, and the community will end up like Canada -- but too much closeness, and the community will also fail.      This is the main thesis of Jared Diamond's \\"Collapse,\\" although he doesn't frame it this way.  According to Professor Diamond, societies fail or succeed because of five factors:  environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trade partners, and society's responses to environmental problems.  While all five may be relevant I don't think they are all equally weighed.  The author believes the environment to be the deciding factor, but I disagree.  Every society faces crises, and ultimately it's a society's response (whether it is willing to confront the challenge, and whether it is an open and dynamic enough of society to formulate an effective, united response) that's the deciding factor.      Professor Diamond's book is lush with concrete examples, and it is an informative guide to world cultures.  But it's also badly organized and badly written, and I found it extremely difficult to traverse through the lush terrain, which was so overloaded I found it much of a swamp than a meadow.      Consider this:  if Professor Diamond had his way he would have called his book \\"Societal collapses involving an environmental component, and in some cases also contributions of climate change, hostile neighbors, and trade partners, plus questions of societal responses.\\"  Enough said.

044654146X|5.0|I read this excellent book, here in Brazil. This book was writen by two Jews: Dan Senor and Saul Singer. And this book is correct, concise and very easy to understand. If you read this book, you will see that companies such as Cisco, Google, Intel, etc. are so successful, because they are using inovations from Israeli Jews.  I found just two mistakes in all this book. On page page 130, there's a small mistake about eugenics and on page 130 this book claims that France sold fighters to Syria, while France sold jets to Lybia, another Israel's foe.  The best part of this book, I found on pages 209 and 210. There, I could read these sentences: \\"The United Nations' Arab Human Development, which presented the organization's research from 2002 through 2005, found that the number of books translated annually into Arabic in all the Arab countries combined was one-fifth the number translated into Greek in Greece. The number of patents registered between 1980 and 2000 from saudi Arabia was 171; from Egypt, 77; from Kuwait, 52; from United Arab Emirates, 32; from Syria, 20; and from Jordan, 15 - compared with 7,652 from Israel. The Arab world has the highest illiteracy rates globally and one of the lowest numbers of active research scientists with frequently cited articles. In 2003, China published a list of the five hundred best universities in the world; it did not include a single mention of the more than two hundred universities in the Arab world.\\"
0385341008|5.0|A friend recommended I should read this book with the strange title; knowing nothing about it, I didn't want to invest in buying a new copy, so \\"Thank you, Amazon!\\"  My used copy arrived shortly after ordering it; it was already broken in for my reading and handling of it, and I am soooo glad I did.  It was a delightful experience: educational and enlightening to a period in history that has always grabbed my attention and my heart; pleasing to my \\"literary side\\" as the descriptions of the various characters emerged as believable, loveable personalities -- just what my imagination held for an islander Brit; emotionally multi-faceted, making me laugh, smile, shed a tear, and then to ponder the atrocities of life lived in war-time.  I loved it and I've thanked my friend Jesse for recommending it.....and oh by the way, yes, I also recommend it!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|\\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\", \\"DEXTER\\".<br />As always Dexter is back at it again and it's fantastic! I finished the entire season in two sittings! A little light this season on the \\"Evil\\" but that was intentional and worked with the plot line. Next season on the other hand is sure to be a lot more intense (maybe the most so far) and Dexter's \\"Dark Passengers\\" inner monologue is sure to be running at wide open throttle. Again, this season would have been a steal at double the money!

0307594777|2.0|I found those books very difficult to read, obviously a translation from a foreign language. Not quite the right word for the intended meaning. It's difficult to keep interested in the story.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I love finding a great movie that I hadn't expected to be good. Most comedy zombie movies have disappointed me, to the point that I avoided this one for months. I'm in the minority, but I hated Shaun of the Dead. Consequently, I skipped past this one every time I saw it in the Redbox. Eventually, the reviews convinced me it was worth a rental, and I was so glad I was wrong.    The ultra-slow motion beginning credits pulled me in right away, almost as good a beginning as the Dawn of the Dead remake. Columbus's rules for survival were very funny, and the rest of the characters were well done. I particularly liked Emma Stone's character. Unpredictable, fast moving, well-written dialogue. I'm glad I finally watched this particular zombie comedy.
1931559317|5.0|I bought the Pocket Sky Atlas to use during a college astronomy class. As it turned out, I was over-prepared and didn't require a sky atlas, but it did prove helpful later on once I learned the locations of a few constellations. I was able to look up the ones I learned to find during my class in the Sky Atlas and find nearby features of interest.<br /><br />Although not quite pocket-sized as the name suggests, the Pocket Sky Atlas is smaller than other atlases and therefore easy to throw in an already crowded book bag. While the book is spiral bound, the cover is attached on the back to the coils, then wraps around them to the front. It's interesting looking, but causes the faux-spine of the cover to be slightly flimsy. However, it's held up quite nicely so far.<br /><br />The charts themselves are split into eight slices based on right ascension that extend from north to south. Initially, I found that to be a confusing technique. Flipping through, it seemed vague where exactly in the sky I was supposed to be looking at. However, I bought the Sky Atlas along with The Night Sky planisphere by David Chandler, and I found using them together made navigating the night sky very easy. Either I'll use the Night Sky to find an interesting area of stars above me and look up the details of it in the Sky Atlas, or I'll browse the Sky Atlas for interesting features and use the Night Sky to actually find it above me.<br /><br />I would recommend this to others interested in astronomy. :)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Besides being a teriffic space show, the quality of the DVD is top notch.

Also features dolby surround sound and closed captions.
B0002XMF5I|4.0|when the standard for a band is set so high, an otherwise good album could be misconstrued as a dissappointment.  The sum of the music is not as good as all of its parts.  meaning that although Ian Gillan is certainly one of the most talented vocalists (the dude was on broadway too!!), he isnt Ozzy and Ozzy is what works best with Iommi/Geezer/Bill Ward.  my understanding is they signed an agreement to do this while drunk and werent even going to call it black sabbath! but had some contractual obligations to do so.  would be like Velvet Revolver being called guns and roses today.  Zero the Hero is a great song.  Trashed is a rocker and fun to just crank up (just dont follow the lyrics literally and sucked down a bottle of tequila while dirving 100 mph!)  i like Born again as it showcases Ians' vocal range with a meloncholy/kind of slow but spooky sound.      i've listened to some video clips out there of this tour and Ian Gillan sounds great on the old ozzy stuff (they didnt play any dio material on that tour).  he sounds evil on Black Sabbath, psychotic on War Pigs... just great.    is this album up there with master of reality, sabotage, paranoid, vol 4?  no.  its a very good rock and roll album.  i wouldnt recommend it to be part of the essential black sabbath collection.  if i were to rate this according to other sabbath albums, i'd give it a 3.  but compared to some of the arena/hair metal music released during that time, and as a general hard rock album, this is definitely a very good one.

0307454541|1.0|I don't know what the hype is all about. I don't know why people are raving about this book. The beginning was slow and boring.  Then as you read on, the story takes you along this rollercoaster of climaxes that falls flat. I waited til I finished the book to conclude that I wasted my time with a boring book with a weak story line. Not even interested in the movie or the second book.
B0009PAVI2|4.0|This is a nice add-on for the Tamrac bags. I have decided I need a bigger one though. This one holds 3 filters, keeps them secure. Be aware if you are where the wind blows that sand/dirt may get on the filters if you attach this to the outside of the bag with the Velcro strap. I was on the beach and came home with a little sand in mine. The filters were still fine, but didn't like the fact I had sand in there.

B0034G4OWM|2.0|I love Brandon Fraser, but this movie is difficult to like. A bunch of animals take out their hatred on an unlikable man that is pigeonholed by his boss to spearhead turning their forest into a housing development. The animal trainers deserve a medal and the people that special effected the animals. I don't mean talking Disney animals. I mean real animals that don't talk. Occasionally they have thought bubbles, but it just looks cheap. Skunks spray him, raccoons end up in his car, crows peck at his window when he's getting sleep and several animals have an elaborate plan to kill people by bashing their cars off cliffs (their plan looks like the game Mousetrap). The supporting cast of his wife and son are just \\"there.\\" They don't do much other than look at Brandon like he's crazy.    This movie would be a more crowd pleasing if these were Disney talking animals and if Brandon played a clear cut evil villain like Cruella Deville. Maybe if this movie were less real and more cartoonish it would be better. Another thing wrong with the movie is product placement, there's a lot of it, everything from \\"Who wants a new Wii,\\" to iPhones and iMacs everywhere.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Michael has been blessed with a throw back voice and style. He wears it so well to. This CD has songs that are classics and songs that are for today.

030726999X|4.0|I bought the three book set through Amazon and the price was great.<br /><br />I finished the first two books really fast and the second one was the better of the first two.<br /><br />This third one is a difficult read.  It is character-laden to the point of being rediculous.  You almost need a few reference pages to reinforce who the characters are and what their purpose is in the story line so you don't get them mixed up. You want to read it because you want to know what happens to Salander but you will have to slog through a lot of stuff before you do find out.  And, in the end, you won't know who the heck half of the people are and why they have to be in it in the first place.<br /><br />It is tooooooo much work!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|No doubts this product is a collector´s must have. An outstanding complete pack, with absolute everything a Matrix fan needs, with the quality only blu-ray can offer. And the seller is excellent. I strongly recommend. Thanks.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|Liz Gilbert has a writing style not favorable to some but quite appealing to many. Her personal, relaxed approach to writing allows the reader to submerge themselves in the text easier, as well as have a stronger connection with the content. I was experiencing many of the feelings and tackling many of the obstacles that Liz Gilbert was at the time i read \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\", so the combination of that and her friendly tone allowed me to easily connect and relate to the book. Although her novel is about her personal trials and tribulations, the struggle is common; her divorce represents the end of any long-term relationship, her wanderlust is similar to the restlessness inside many of us who are unsure of who we are and where our lives are going, and her coming-of-age situation is similar to the burst of energy for life we all crave. For those out there who are broken-hearted, \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" serves as a new hope to get out of bed, throw away the used tissues, take a shower, then experience the world and all it has to offer! What i found most interesting about the novel was the diversity of characters: a teenage indian girl, a cheerful balinese medicine man, a brutally honest texan, artistic david, a guy with the last name of Spaghetti, and many others. Liz's personal journey teaches us all that only good things can come from \\"putting yourself out there\\". As a teenager, i sometimes found that it was hard to go out, be social, and just strike up a conversation with a stranger at a party. But after reading Liz's novel, i learned to live with an open heart and make room for exciting new characters in my own life. So pick up this book, take a trip to Italy, India, and beautiful Bali, and make your own personal journey as well. It's worth it.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Both Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx give really good performances here but I was most impressed with Gerard. He gives a really fierce performance that I enjoy watching a lot. The ending was a bit of a let down but it still held some subtle strengths with the things we see in the scene. This movie is filled with shocks, suspense and thrills. It's an underrated film in my opinion.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I watched this made for tv movie on a saturday night in 1984 when it premiered and was stunned at the conclusion. I felt so strongly about the movie that I spent $44.00 a few months later to buy a vhs copy. When you hold this movie, you are holding courage in your hands. The power of the story is everlasting. This is not a catholic film. This is Schindler's List on the streets of Rome. This is courage feeding on courage. This is people doing the right thing at great risk. As other reviewers have remarked, it was funny seeing \\"Captain Von Trapp\\" in  a Nazi SS uniform. This movie left me emotional and glad that I had took to time to watch it and you'll be glad too!
030726999X|5.0|\\"The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" by Stieg Larsson is the third book in the Millennium series. Having read all three books in order within the past month leads me to consider the impact of the series as a whole as well as the merits of this particular book.<br />Standing alone, this book is a crime thriller and courtroom drams all rolled into one.  It tells the story of Lisabeth Salander, aided by her friends (though for the most part she does not know of their help until later and she would have declined the help of offered directly to her) and her quest to defend herself against charges and a massive cover-up by the Swedish equivalent of the counter-intelligence unit of the CIA. If is faster paced than the other two novels and the reader is led down an exciting path as events unfo9ld.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the Millennium trilogy paints an engaging picture of the social democratic society of Sweden and details its police structure, the State Security structure and the judicial system. It provides readers with a look into the social mores of Swedish society while telling an involved and gripping tale of the betrayal of a youth and its subsequent consequences.<br /><br />I felt the first book in the series took too long in the build -up to the action, but once the stage was set the action proceeded apace until the end of the final book in the series.<br /><br />Lisabeth, we are going to miss you. . . but didn't I hear that the author, now deceased, had another book almost finished in his computer? Hmmmm!!!!!!

0307454541|3.0|loads of folks around my office are all atwizzle, buzzing about this must read novel. i'm naturally skeptical about mass urgings but relented and eventually picked up this tome for a 3 day weekend.  i've read menkell, the laughing policeman, etc. so am fully aware of the scandanavian crime genre.  i must say that stigg larson cant hold a bucket of ludefest to his predecessors.  put aside his obvious parroting of the masters, nothing larson has scribbled is original.  probably more troubling than the pedestrian litany and narrative is the inexplicable embrace of this fraud they call stiig.  the most entertaining element of this book was the coffee motif...gallons of coffee were consumed.  the sexual exchanges read more like fantasy than reality and we soon realize that larson was a deprived man is the rack.  when the journalist brings down his nemesis at the end by way of lazy emails, i roll my eyes and reach for another toke.  the 90 lb tatooed girl is nothing but a characature and one must understand that this book is fueled by stereotype.  I'm giving this pile of words a tepid recommendation.
0385732554|5.0|Lois Lowry must know something we don't.  Lois Lowry's book never fail to amaze me.  The Giver takes place in the future where there is a perfect world.  Nothing is wrong, everything is the same.  There are no wars, no fighting, no pain.  Everything is simply perfect.  Or so it seems.  In this world there is no emotion.  There is no love.  You are assigned a certain job, a wife, and a family.  There are no colors, no variety.  Everything is the same.  Jonas is not an ordinary child.  He sees things others don't, feels things others don't.  When the day comes to assign jobs, Jonas is assigned as The Giver.  The Giver is the one who has all the memories of the past, all the feeling, everything.  This is no easy job, but can Jonas do it?  This book is incredible, for lack of a better word.  I recommend this book to all.
0316010669|4.0|Again Malcolm Gladwell uses his considerable talent for insights to look at the way in which we make decisions. His questions are when we should trust our intuition and when not, why we should sometimes trust our intuition and how we can make our intuition more trustworthy. The book is called 'blink' because intuitive decisions happen in the 'blink' of an eye.  The book is well argued, though from time to time connecting the dots becomes confusing, as Malcolm Gladwell tends to jump from topic to topic and only in the end brings some rhythm and rhyme to it.  His fundamental message is that snap decisions can be correct but only if based on experience or training. E.g. experts can make correct snap decisions but if you are not an expert, you should not trust snap decisions.  What Malcolm Gladwell does in this book is to spell out clearly what fundamentally was known but was rarely spelled out. E.g. a good chess player is also at 1 minute chess better than an average chessplayer, because his snap decisons are based on experience. And a professional race car driver is certainly better than me at carting.  Yet though the result of his analysis is correct, the question remains whether his reasoning is correct. Is it simply that the expert can draw on such a wealth of data intuitively that he can make a better decision? Or is it that the expert can see more clearly what is relevant and what is not relevant? In chess (an example which Gladwell does not use) the expert clearly can more easily dismiss branches of the decisiontree which the average player does not so rapidly dismiss. This matters, as some of the situations Gladwell describes require the decisionmaker to focus on the relevant details, while other situations like the described police situation, requires the decider to consider a very broad range of input.  And some of the examples he gives are not very relevant or too anecdotal to really matter. Is the Pepsi test really news? And the people who judged correctlyfrom a very short video (or was it a photo) of a dorm room the character of the student - against which measure was their impression judeged? Was there a panel of jurors who declared that this student would be deemed unrelaibale on a scale from 1 to six and the snap judgement was tested against this?  In any case, a readable and recommendable book with significant weaknesses.
030726999X|5.0|I for one am not ready for this series to end. Nor do I feel the need to do another review. This is just a wish and a hope that Stieg Larsson's long time girl friend wins her legal battles with his money-hungry family so that she can continue this great series. I have to believe that she played a strong part in the writing of these super feminist novels and that the plot outlines he left behind can be developed by her. Go get 'em and then bring it home to us!!!

1563899426|5.0|This first volume couldn't really hold my attention and I almost dropped from reading the remainder of the series. After reading the last 13 volumes to include all seven \\"Jack of Fables\\" (as of Aug 2010). I am hooked. Excellent storytelling and great art. I always condsidered comics as a passion for nerds, but about two years ago I bought the \\"The Walking Dead\\" and Fables was a recomendation from Amazon. I said what the heck and bought it. I have not been sorry since. ABC TV is lined up to turn this into TV show for the 2011 fall season. Really hope it turns out.
034544678X|5.0|This is a wonderful book for people who go beyond being a casual dog owner. If you are interested in the things that motivate dogs and how human interaction can help modify negative behaviors or can help encourage appropriate behaviors this book is for you. There are plenty of stories that the author shares from her experience as a dog behaviorist. Unlike many books that are out there this author is actually qualified to talk on the subject since she has a PhD in animal behavior with a specialty in canines. This is not someone who claims to be a dog trainer - she really is one! I don't know that it is an \\"easy\\" read but if you are really looking for more insight on canine behaviors I highly recommend it!

1439181780|1.0|Some years ago a little-known Australian TV writer/producer burst on the scene with a book (originally a virally promoted DVD) titled \\"The Secret.\\" The publicity for that project promised as follows (and here I quote from an interview given by Byrne herself):<br /><br />\\"With the knowledge from The Secret there is not anything any human cannot be, do or have...not a single thing. No limits whatsoever. It doesn't matter where anybody is now--it doesn't matter if they're sleeping in a park, if they're totally broke, it doesn't matter if they're not well, it doesn't matter if their relationships are a mess. It doesn't matter where they are, when they gain this knowledge and when they apply and use The Secret in their life, their lives will totally change.\\"<br /><br />Of course, we all know what happened next. Lots of people's lives did indeed totally change...in the sense that they went to hell in a hand basket. The U.S. economy tanked. Millions of us \\"attracted\\" unemployment and foreclosures. And some of the alumni of Byrne's DVD project--notably including James \\"Sweat Lodge\\" Ray--saw an opportunity: Clearly there must have been something missing from \\"The Secret\\"! A secret ingredient, if you will. They began selling spinoff products and programs of their own devising, products and programs that guaranteed to help Byrne's befuddled fans--who must have wondered where it all went wrong--get back on the path to Universal prosperity. Byrne, no doubt, noticed all this and decided it was time for a sequel of her own. Hence, \\"The Power.\\" And what does this book promise?<br /><br />\\"In this book you will come to understand that all it takes is just one thing to change your relationships, money, health, happiness, career, and your entire life. Every discovery, invention, and human creation comes from The Power. Perfect health, incredible relationships, a career you love, a life filled with happiness, and the money you need to be, do, and have everything you want, all come from The Power. The life of your dreams has always been closer to you than you realized, because The Power--to have everything good in your life--is inside you. To create anything, to change anything, all it takes is just one thing...THE POWER.\\"<br /><br />Am I missing something, or is that awfully close to what Byrne promised the world a few years ago in \\"The Secret\\"? More to the point, if \\"The Secret\\" was really the be-all-and-end-all of universal harmony--then why is a sequel necessary in the first place? Maybe it's just me, but if you're framing \\"The Power\\" as the ultimate key to success, isn't that a repudiation of The Secret? So why should we believe Byrne now?<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's not that \\"The Power\\" isn't chock-full of brilliant and inspiring advice. Such as, if you want new clothes, just place empty hangers in your closet. (How could that possibly fail!) Or there's this passage, about the relationship between love and money:<br /><br />\\"Love is the attracting force that brings money, and love is also the power that makes money stick. You have to give love and feel good about money to bring it to you and make it stick. If...your credit card debt is increasing, you have no sticking power and you are repelling money.\\"<br /><br />So let me get this straight. My love-meter determines the balance on my credit cards? Or could it have more to do with all those new clothes the Universe brought to me (by way of Saks Fifth Avenue, perhaps?).<br /><br />Taking Byrne's advice as a whole, one is reminded of the classic line from one of the Johnson characters in response to Gabby's gibberish in the famous church scene from \\"Blazing Saddles\\": \\"Now who could argue with that...!\\"<br /><br />Finally, Byrne says the power of love will fill your bank account.

B003YP0BI4|5.0|Ahhh... new Maiden. The thought of a new Iron Maiden album always sends people into a frenzy. \\" Holy crap, I have to pick this up as soon as I can!\\" Well, I'm here to say that this attention is well deserved. The Final Frontier is Maiden's 15th album, for those who haven't been counting. It continues the progressive direction from AMOLAD. For me, this album didn't click at first. However, at the second listen (because I don't give up on Maiden), I started to understand what was going on. The opening track, for example, takes four and a half minutes to hit its stride. Once it does though, it's prime Maiden throughout.<br /><br />As for individual performances, the one that stands out for me is Bruce Dickinson. He sounds like the envy of a vocalist half his age. I know, I'm 18 and can't resist singing along to songs on this thing, just as I did when I first heard Number of the Beast. The only song I can't give him praise on is Mother of Mercy. Awkward lyrics and chorus kinda destroy the point of the song. The triple guitar attack is still as potent as ever, with Dave, Adrian, and Janick ripping this album to shreds(in a good way). Nicko Mcbrain, as always, provides a great rhythm to this album. Harris isn't very active on this album, besides the bass intro to the first two tracks. However, he writes most of the songs, so he makes up for the lack of bass with his excellent songwriting skill.<br /><br />The album starts with Satellite 15... The Final Frontier. After a very alien ( and very long intro), the band rocks it and doesn't stop for the 70+ minute run time. There are really no standout tracks for me, because their all excellent in their own way. The only track I can't like is Mother of Mercy( description in the above paragraph). Calling this album epic would be an epic understatement. However, they remain epic without being cheesy or being instrumentally showy( see Dream Theater).<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the longer songs and progressive territory the band has crossed into. However, I don't think the longer songs will keep away the extremely loyal fans away. In fact, I would put this album as their best since, dare I say it, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Blasphemy, you say. Well, whatever your opinion of the band, this is sure to please Iron Maiden fans, old and new. Don't believe me? Give it a couple listens and tell me otherwise.<br /><br />4.5 stars. Highly Recommended.

B003VWC4AI|5.0|Sir Ken Robinson's book, \\"The Element,\\" is about many people who didn't thrive in the traditional school approach. Take for example, Gillian Lynne who is a famous dancer and choreographer. She was thought to have some disabilities but her mother took her to the right psychologist who diagnosed her as a dancer and needing movement to thrive.<br /><br />You can also examine how Sir Paul McCartney and his Beatles disliked music class because of the traditional setting and a dull music teacher. There are other stories here to mention like some of the most successful people in their line of work, famous and not famous but successful, became legends in their fields. They did it without being traditional and finding their element which is what thrives them to become successful not only as household names in some cases but as happily fulfilled. How many of us are going through that exact same thing only to learn that we were never told that there was more than one learning style around and how teachers are trying to adapt in getting students to achieve successfully in the classroom.<br /><br />I found this book to be both an easy read and enjoyable in learning that if you didn't succeed in school doesn't mean that you are dumb but rather unchallenged and unable to thrive because you can't make music or explore your imagination. The school system today is in disarray for a variety of reasons like money and politics. If you have children, you should be concerned when the school systems are too sensitive and restrict learning because of fear.<br /><br />The schools today particularly K-12 are totally frightened by political and economic backlash so they are totally frightened into not challenging their students. Even in the private schools, the students who are creative and imaginative like myself were limited to pursuing it in favor of the traditional structure.<br /><br />I appreciate Dr. Ken Robinson for his insight in helping explain why we are miserable in many ways. Many of us whether we are 3 or a 103 haven't found our element to succeed professionally and personally. Imagine if we were allowed to do what we loved, wouldn't be happy? Sure, we would. I envy those who are able to pursue their talents, interests, and areas and are both happy personally and professionally but for those of us who can't break through into that world because of closed doors and politics, it's harder to imagine. I envy those who get the breaks and chances that many of us will never get because the arts is very difficult. It's under-funded, under-appreciated, and only 1 percent of 1 percent thrive in that area.haven't found our element to succeed professionally and personally.

B000JML7EC|5.0|I hadn't read Treasure Island in many years, but when I saw that it was available for my new Kindle I downloaded it. A good move for me, as I had forgotten how great it is.  Although I was a teenager when I first read it, I think I enjoy it even more now that I am over 60. The story probably has less appeal to kids today since pirates are not a favorite subject for youth as it once was. But I would recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting story with many twist and turns.
B003O97W5K|5.0|Wow, what a classic!  Amazing buildup, great scares, great acting.  This is a really well written horror movie, and while it does show at times, it is hard to believe it's over 25 years old.  Especially when you watch it on Blu Ray!<br /><br />No matter how many times you've seen the movie before, it'll be like the first once you've seen this amazing 1080p transfer.  The image is crisp and sharp without looking digitized. There's fantastic background clarity that gives you that feeling of 3D depth that make Blu Ray fanatics giddy with delight.  And the best part is the audio!  Throbbing bass and delicious thunder, groans from the closet that sound like they are literally lurking behind you.  Sometimes you run across a poor transfer with low budget horror movies, but you can tell Spielburg and Hooper made sure this was filmed right.  Thankfully, this fantastic blu ray release is a proper representation of how the movie was meant to be seen.<br /><br />Overall, if this is a favorite of yours or even if you own the DVD, I can safely recommend the upgrade.  If you've never seen the 25 year old classic, there's no better time to than with this amazing release.  You'll be able to experience this movie at home like no generation has gotten to do before, isn't blu ray great!
B000FS9MV0|5.0|As of this posting, there were 81 other reviews of this album, some of which were obviously very knowledgeable about jazz and jazz artists... While most only sung Renee's praises, some mentioned an untrained voice that \\"makes my ears bleed\\"... Well, to those I say, as Count Basie said, \\"If it sounds good, it IS good.\\" ...<br /><br />I for one will not disparage this talented young singer because her music is not perfection to the trained musical ear... I'll just say that for me, Count Basie had it right... Renee Olstead's voice is as easy on the ears as her appearance is on the eyes; this assortment of new tunes (4) and jazz standards (9) is as refreshing an offering of music as a rose in the desert...<br /><br />I sincerely hope this effort also foretells the entry of more youth into REAL music, instead of the rap and hip-hop garbage that gives REAL meaning to \\"makes my ears bleed\\"...<br /><br />If you love music, all genres of music, you'll most likely want to add this mesmerizing and hypnotic, sultry and sensuous young voice to your collection... You won't be able to listen to it just once!
1439181780|1.0|The Power, like The Secret before it, is not any revelation of musty occult wisdom but a garbage/garbled rehash of books that have been published by the truckload every decade from the 1890's through the 1990's. Endless little tweakings of the Law of Extraction, oops I mean The Law of Attraction, trying to finesse with metaphysical legalese the fact that it just doesn't work very well. So they need to keep tweaking it, reframing the advice with a tug on a rope here, a tightening of a screw there, how to affirm, what to think, what to see in your mind's eye. But it's just trivial superstition designed to fill RB's bank account - and she's laughing all the way there.     For example, in 'The Power' RB writes:    \\"When you pay your bills, find a way to make yourself feel good. Imagine they aren't bills at all. Instead, say you've decided to donate money to each company or person out of the goodness of your heart, because of the wonderful service they provide. Imagine your bills are checks you are receiving\\"    That is a total and shameless ripoff from the (also more or less useless) book: 'Busting Loose from the Money Game' by Robert Schein, where he pioneered the above little spin on the basic empty theme of getting something for nothing.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Great series! I thought for the most part it was an accurate to what the modern day military.  I thought the series did a good job of showing how a war scars a generation of a nation.
B003OT4LZY|3.0|When hearing about this new project by Richard Ashcroft, I was, as with anything associated with The Verve or Richard Ashcroft, quite excited about it. However, I  wasn't expecting anything too different than any of Ashcroft's previous solo efforts. And I definitely wasn't expecting any of the material to be anything along the lines of The Verve. Ashcroft's solo work has always only incorporated small pieces of The Verve's sound (usually Urban Hymns era), and with this project, he's even furthered distanced himself from that. Collaborating with artists that are more involved in the Hip-Hop and R&B genres, and produced by No I.D. (who's worked with many Hip-Hop artists), this new project definitely has that kind of Hip-Hop feel to it on many of the tracks. Just listen to this record on a decent sound system, and you can tell the difference in the bass, and how the beats stand out in the songs. So if you're wanting some straight forward rock songs, (thought there's some decent guitar work here and there) there's just not a lot of that here. Which, honestly, I see Ashcroft as more of a pop artist now than a rock artist anyway. There's just not a lot of true \\"rock\\" tunes by Ashcroft since he the Verve disbanded (again).<br />Now as far as this album goes, as a whole, I'm just not overly impressed with it. I'm not saying it's a bad album. And maybe I need more time for it to grow on me, but there's not really a lot to get too excited about. This first thing I noticed about this album was that a large portion of these songs feel that they are more like jam sessions rather than completely finished, polished songs. I'm not saying the production or quality is bad, I'm just saying this album sounds a bit hurried to me in that regard. And that in some cases, songs go on for a tad too long and lyrics seem to be made up as the song goes..again, kind of like a jam session.  I also feel like too much of this record sounds like its simply on a loop. I understand that probably should be expected, considering the kind of sound Ashcroft was maybe going for and the influences of the people he worked with on this project. But a lot of times it just feels like the music doesn't go nowhere because its  the same beats or riffs just repeated over and over until the song ends. The same thing kind of goes for the lyrics too. Maybe I'm just being picky here, but a lot of lyrics are repeated too. Almost like they are used to just fill out the rest of the song in some cases.<br />  One good thing I will say, and maybe it's the most important, is the overall feel of the album. You can really feel the passion Ashcroft brings to his music, especially in his voice. There's a lot of passionate, uplifting tracks here. And you can tell that Ashcroft is doing something he really loves doing, which is writing, creating, and performing music. And with that being said, I think a lot of these tracks would sound  better in a live setting.<br /> It may sound like I'm bashing this album pretty hard, and I don't mean for it to be that way, I'm just giving my overall opinion.  Again, I don't think this is a bad album, but perhaps I was expecting something a bit better though. Again, a lot of this album seems hurried or unfinished to me. There's a lot of good stuff here, its just that I just don't feel this album reached its full potential. I still feel that Ashcroft is one of the best songwriters and front-men around, and I respect the guy for going in a bit different direction with this album. But I will always say his best work was with The Verve, no matter how many solo projects he does in the future.<br /><br />Anyway, here's a brief review of each track:<br /><br />Are You Ready? - Anthem sounding, yet seems to go on for too long. The \\"chorus\\" is repeated a lot. Nothing really develops in the track musically. It sounds like its on a loop, just repeating over and over while Ashcroft sings. Great ending guitar solo however which brings something different to the tune.<br /><br />Born Again- Uplifting tune. Good intro. More straight-forward rock sound. One of better, if the not the best tracks on the album.<br /><br />America- Very beat driven pop song. Again, the chorus is repeated a lot. But again, has some pretty good guitar work towards the end of the track.<br /><br />This Thing Called Life - Again, another strong beat, almost R & B style. And again, another uplifting message to it.  Good lyrics for the most part, but the delivery teeters on the edge of being epic and being a bit rambling. Seems to be a bit too drawn out.<br /><br />Beatitutes- Just can't really get into this track, musically or lyrically. More rock oriented song with a driving beat, but just not too impressed overall with this one. Chorus is repeated way too much. Again, should have been a shorter song without all the repeating.<br /><br />Good Lovin' - Probably the closest track to sounding like previous Ashcroft work. Sounds like it could have been off  Keys to the World. Not a bad track, as with most Ashcroft's work, really good orchestration. But overall, nothing too amazing here.<br /><br />How Deep is Your Man?- Easily my least favorite track on the album.  The majority of the song is nothing more than a blues riff  played with some weak lyrics. I get what he was trying to do, but It just doesn't work in my opinion.<br /><br /> She Brings Me the Music - Decent tune, good melody. It has elements of another song that I can't think of at the moment, because it does sound familiar. Builds to a really good ending, starting around the 3 minute mark.<br /><br />Royal Highness - Another decent track with a good guitar riff, yet its continually played throughout the song pretty much without stopping.  I like the over-dubbed vocal tracks and the vocal delivery, but again, musically, the basic structure of the song starts but really doesn't go many places.<br /><br />Glory- Another great uplifting, anthem sounding song. One of my favorite tracks on the album. Again, great orchestrations. Simple lyrics, but again, the overall feel of the song makes brings a lot to the track.<br /><br />Life Can Be Beautiful - Pretty much a pop/hip-hop song sprinkled with guitars, horns and some orchestra parts. The high-pitch vocal delivery throws me off a bit. Again, sounds more like a jam than a complete song, and the lyrics sounds made up as it goes.<br /><br />Let My Soul Rest - Once again, another uplifting joyous tune. Alright tune,  and fits well as an album closing track.ting tune. Good intro. More straight-forward rock sound. One of better, if the not the best tracks on the album.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Great, great fun! If you know the story of Austen's Pride and Prejudice it is fun to watch as it becomes unraveled. I must admit to some angry moments, but trust me, it all comes right in the end. This movie is perfect for a movie party, keeping in mind that it is 3 hours long. It might even be fun to watch a more serious version of Pride and Prejudice first just to lay the groundwork. The Colin Firth version would be perfect, as it is referenced in this movie, but it is also quite lengthy.
B000UYX4OK|4.0|Interesting rendition of the classic tale.  Like all other cinema versions of the poem, it does not follow the original story and takes it own creative license.  However, this version was entertaining and well done.  As always Amazon's service and shipping was top notch.
B0036EH3WK|3.0|The series was great. The special edition of Season 5 was much better than this. I would have expected a little more for the Complete Collection that what is here. The Dharma Kit was awesome. This one you are more or less just getting the game and some extra video content. Sad.

B0036TGSRG|1.0|The movie stated with an interesting story. However as the story unfolds, it gets a long and extremely boring. The plot was unrealistic and dull. I rather see the \\"Ninth Gate\\" which stared Johnny Depp who at least added character to his role, athough strange. I'm amazed that \\"Ghost Writer\\" received good reviews from the critics. I guess that they were just supporting his legal stance with the USA for a crime that the so called victim did not want to pursue. I'm surprised that the great director of \\"China Town\\" and \\"Rosemary Baby\\" to name a few directed this peace of garbage. The ending was a let down. How stupid can anyone be...I can't wait to sell my copy or trash where it belongs. My guess is that the director wanted to get back at the USA while waiting on house arrest for a crime that is as old as my Oak tree. I rather watch \\"Dum and Dummer.\\" I ordered the novel and hope that it's better than the movie. Rent anything other than this movie and save your money. P.S. There was so much dubbing (editing out so called harsh curse words) that I thought I received a boot leg copy. Where are we in Disley Land or back to the 1950's?[[ASIN:B0036TGSR6 The Ghost Writer]]

B003JTHESA|4.0|Hi,    I have been listening to Iron Maiden for the last 20 year. I have been hearing them mature and grow over the    years. They always had their distinct style which was their common thread in all their albums. It seems they have   fore gone that distinct style on this album for good. I guess they are trying to grow beyond themselves, which is   a good thing in my view.     About this album: The album is quite good, though it feels a little dull occassionally. Up the IRONS!    Iron Maiden are always my only and only favourite musicians.   Regards,   Lakshman M P
B0037N6Z6U|3.0|Epiosode 3 and Tara continues to disgust me as both a person and a woman. First of all, she is WAY too young to have this \\"old folksy wisdome\\" thing they got going for her. Its pretentious in the least. Second, when she says she hasn't had sex in eight months? Really? Oh boo-hoo! For a young, healthy, athletic woman, going without sex is more often a matter of choice, not circumstance. Besides, who would WANT to be with a person like her? She's obnoxious, uneducated trash. If having sex with her could save me from hell I'd rather get some sunscreen and pack my bags.<br /><br />Another thing about this series. However entertaining, if I were from the south I would be outraged at how southerners are are portrayed. In the case of Jason<br />and the hot waitress ( I forget her name) they show southerners as basically whacked and trashy. I have family in the south and believe me, they're not trashy. Now Philadelphians on the other hand? Well, let's just say I've lived here for 14 years and...uh...uneducated and trashy only scratches the surface.<br /><br />By the way. Sookie's fascination with Bill the Vampire is starting to wear a little thin and its only episode 3. He's dangerous and...dead.<br /><br />Did I mention that Tara needs a beating?<br /><br />Without giving anything away, did these characters ever consider educations and meaningful careers as a way out of their hum-drum lives besides sex, drugs and booze?<br /><br />They mention Starbucks coming to town and the grandmother blathers in wonderment about how can people spend $3.00 on a cup of coffee with some milk. I buy two of their largest every morning and it costs me about $4.85. Where did this mythical $3.00 Starbucks coffee thing get started?

Not a stinker in the bunch!<br /><br />Although not as fluffy as some of her other books this was a thoroughly enjoyable summer read.

There are laugh out loud moments along the way.  What is not to love?<br /><br />Although it makes me feel guilty to say it this is Sophie's most charming book, maybe even better than the Shopaholic series. Watch out! A lightening bolt from heaven might charbroil me any second for writing THAT!<br /><br />Enjoy the read!

0440241901|4.0|As fluffy as whipped cream and just as sweet and delectable Sophie has written a stand alone book that hooked me immediately.  Yes, parts of the plot and characters were a bit of fantasy but nothing wrong with that.  My husband asked me what I was reading as I was laughing out loud during certain scenes.  I can't help but to compare it to a Doris Day movie, simply charming.<br /><br />Enjoy the read!
B000B8QF00|4.0|This is just basically a compilation of some of her songs, so it's not bad because it does fit that bill pretty well.  It does have her most famous radio singles on it and even a few rarities.  This would be good for a fan who maybe doesn't already have much of Alanis Morissette's music.

B002ZG980U|4.0|One of the most lauded films of the summer of 2010, INCEPTION is a big, bold, fascinating, gorgeous film that puts the brains of the audience to work.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really stir the heart very much.  But you'll be hard-pressed to find a more technically assured movie.  Or a movie with such an attractively diverse cast.  It's a film that isn't afraid to be rich, even dense, with plot.  It has creativity coming out of its pores.  It is pretty engrossing throughout (though I'd say it is about 10-15 minutes too long due to a few moments of slack pace).  It just didn't grab me emotionally...and it's amazing how important that is, because even though it had all the things going for it that I mention above...it didn't truly EXCITE me.    In case you haven't heard, INCEPTION envisions a world in which the idea of entering the dreams of others is a reality, and in fact, is a small, lucrative industry.  In this industry, trained extractors and their teams are able to enter the dreams of their subjects to extract secrets.  It's industrial espionage to the highest degree.  It's tricky work, because it's easy to alert the dreamer to ones presence.  But for master extractor Leonardo DiCaprio, it's all in a day's work.  Along with his partner Joseph Gordon Levitt, he's the best at what he does.  Which is why he is hired by Japanese industrialist Ken Watanabe to enter the dreams of the son of a rival industrialist (Cillian Murphy) in order to plant an idea into his mind.  This is the theoretically possible, but certainly highly dangerous, concept of Inception.  Planting an idea is difficult, and the results are not always predictable...as DiCaprio knows all too well.  He had a bad outcome involving inception and his wife (Marion Cotillard)...a mistake that continues literally to haunt him and which is increasingly affecting his dream-roaming abilities.  His team knows he's the best...but they also see that he is liable to put them into great jeopardy.    Because the idea of inception is so complex and involves delving into a dream within a dream within a dream; writer/director Christopher Nolan is obliged to provide us with a lot of back-story & exposition about the conundrums of wandering into and influencing the dreams of others.  To ease his efforts, he introduces a new member to DiCaprio's team, an architect who must construct the dreamworlds they will implant in Murphy.  This architect (Ellen Page) is new to all this, and so much of the early portions of the film involve DiCaprio explaining \\"how this all works\\" to Page.  It's all needed in order for the viewer to follow what comes later...but these scenes have artificiality about them.    Once the inception begins, INCEPTION becomes a tightly wound thriller.  It's sci-fi, true...but the science-fiction is really just trappings for a good, old-fashioned cat-and-mouse movie.  To be honest, I can imagine Alfred Hitchcock tackling this subject matter.  Thrillers wrapped around psychological drama.  Just as James Stewart becomes undone by the memories of his wife and the appearance of her lookalike...so DiCaprio unravels at the memories and dream-appearances of his wife.      Nolan likes to construct movies that are puzzles.  MEMENTO was somewhat like putting together a Rubik's cube...nearly impossible.  It was pure puzzle, with real efforts at character and emotional heft pushed way into the background.  THE PRESTIGE was like the biggest budgeted episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE ever...with the tricks of stage magicians melding with true magic in a story full of twists.  Neither of these films really pretended to have any deeper meaning...they were meant as entertainment for audiences who didn't mind being very attentive to detail and having their minds stretched.  This made them exciting.  INCEPTION has many of the same flavors, but wants very much to be about something more.  It wants to be about the power of dreams and entering dreams.  It explores the damage the process can cause.  However, we all know that we can't really jump into the dreams of others...so all the deep psychological territory Nolan explores has no bearing on what we experience in the real world.  It only illuminates the psychological condition of man in a world in which entering dreams is possible.      DiCaprio is clearly the main character and the nominal hero of the film...and he's an actor I have often admired, even as others have criticized him.  And he has excellent chemistry with the volatile Cotillard.  But much of his mental state feels like a concept and not fully integrated into a believable character.  His anguish often feels generic.  His anger feels generic.  His intensity, for the first time, feels like \\"oh, here is DiCaprio doing his thing again.\\"  Fortunately, the film is packed full of other truly exceptional performances.  Cotillard is truly emerging as a force to be reckoned with.  Ellen Page, even in a thankless role, is never less than compelling:  she's clearly a fiercely intelligent person and it's so nice to see this intelligence allowed to flourish on screen.  The delightful Tom Hardy, as a team member, steals most scenes he's in through simple charisma.  Dileep Rao makes an excellent scientist.  Murphy, though sometimes a bit wooden, does a good job overall.  Gordon Levitt provides a convincing stolidity as DiCaprio's long-time extraction partner.  He's a dream-walking professional who isn't tormented by personal demons.  It's the first role I've seen him in that totally discards the \\"kid actor growing into a young man actor\\" vibe he's had for awhile now.  He is now an adult actor, who simply once was also a child star.  Tom Berenger & Pete Postlewaite are welcome in small roles...and Nolan favorite Michael Caine shows up in a two-scene role that makes us wish he was in 10 times as many scenes.  It's hardly a new observation for me to make, but Caine is truly a giant of the screen.  Does the man even know how to be anything less than the most interesting person on screen when he's in a scene?    Technically, the film is a wonder.  The dreamscapes that are envisioned are marvelous, and even though they are certainly heavily reliant on CGI...the CGI is top-notch and convincing.  Watching Paris fold in on itself is something worth seeing in the theaters.  The musical score is often intrusive...but it is meant to be.  The score truly helps build the sense of dread that Nolan is going for.  And best of all is a series of scenes involving Gordon Levitt fighting some \\"bad guys\\" while the hotel hallway he is in keeps spinning around.  It feels a little like something we might have seen in a MATRIX movie...only executed about 10 times more convincingly.  Later, Gordon Levitt has to move all his companions (who are busy dreaming) into an elevator.  The method he uses to complete this, while gravity has lost its grip on HIS world, is quietly fascinating.  Simply put, the film is endlessly inventive when it comes to visuals.    I highly recommend INCEPTION.  It is intellectually stimulating and is frequently quite exciting.  Most of the performances are top-notch.  (And frankly, I don't think the puzzle is all that difficult to keep up with...don't believe critics who say you have to see it twice to figure out what's going on.)  It just doesn't quite grab you in the heart.  I was always interested, always engaged, but never swept away.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Bad mood, good mood, angry mood, it doesn't matter. This album is the one I turn to. Excellent for emphatically punching your steering wheel to.<br />brb, going to listen to it again.
0156027321|1.0|I ordered my books on August 11th 2010. My estimated arrival date was August 16th 2010. It is not August 19th 2010 and i still have not received the books that I ordered. On the tracking of the package, It says it is in transit in the same place since August 13th. Amazon has taken my money and I don't have my books and I have no way of notifying anyone or getting my money back. That is why I made this review. Hopefully someone will see this and can help me!
B003JTHETY|5.0|first off the album is not bad at all just like all the other maiden albums i really loved they took a few listens repeatedly to get into my head but for some reason this one and the others were better because of this. i listened to it at work over and over and did the driving test with it, the album passed all the test in my book oh' thanks adrian for writing so much on here i always found that u steve and bruce make great collaborations together gers is doin good now too and whenever dave murray writes it is great also....

0385504225|4.0|I love all three novels in this series. Living in DC, I was happy to see Lost Symbol based here.  But living in DC, I also picked up on a flaw in Brown's research.  It's a minor thing, of no importance to the story, but shakes my faith in the research he's done into areas I know nothing of.<br /><br />Here it is: He describes the Metro train coming out of the tunnel with a whoosh of warm air at the King Street station in Alexandria, VA.  But King Street is an elevated, open-air station. There is no tunnel. Brown must have visited the Washington Masonic Memorial in order to write the book, and there's no way he could stand in front of it and not see the King Street Metro.<br /><br />Even if he's never been to the DC area, all he'd have to do is Google \\"King Street Metro\\", click the images link, and he'd see that there's no tunnel.  Truly sloppy work, Dan, but I still love your books.
0143038419|3.0|The book was good, but, to me it didn't live up to all the hype it got. I enjoyed the Italy and Bali parts, while the India part started to get bogged down. I do want to see the movie because Julia seems like the perfect person to play Liz.
0670021652|2.0|This book is a nonfiction about the troubles that marriage presents for women. If you are against marriage, it will only further fuel your ideas, but if you plan on getting married, this book is a serious downer. It talks about the Marriage Imbalance, which is the most interesting part of the whole book, but I would suggest just googling this instead of reading her 1 chapter about it. It's not an intellectual read since she's not an expert in the field. It's more like 1 woman's rambling on the subject of marriage. The whole book is her trying desperately to convince herself it's okay, when obviously, it's not.
0897500482|3.0|Bruce Lee was a very interesting man. If you're just curious about Bruce and want to know more about him, you'll probably like this book, but there may be other books about him that would suit you better. Personally, I had a keen interest in Zen, and I would say that there are about 30 pages in this book (out of 200) which shed a great deal of light on Bruce's notions of Zen. In contrast, the bulk of the book is given over to a detailed exposition of Bruce's approach to the martial arts: how to fight, how to prepare oneself for fighting, and how to use strategy and tactics to basically beat the daylights out of someone who is trying to kill you. I was surprised that there was not more space devoted to kicking, because I see some of Bruce's old fight scenes where he uses kicking extensively. However, I would very much recommend this book to anyone interested in American boxing, because Bruce really lays out a thorough method for it. As for Zen, there are some heavy ideas laid out in this book, but those are concentrated in the sections at the beginning and near the end of the text. In any case, lovers of Kung Fu fighting are sure to enjoy...
B0036TGSR6|5.0|I was sitting on the edge of my seat during the whole movie as the plot got thicker and thicker. Adam Lange (Brosnan) is a former British Prime Minister who hires Ewan McGregor to finish ghost writing his memoirs. As the movie opens we see the first ghost writer's body wash up on the beach. Ewan is selected because he is politically stupid. After his initial meeting with a hiring group,(Jim Belushi) he is handed a manuscript to look at. On his way home, he is mugged and the manuscript stolen. He suspects it is because the robbers thought it was Adam Lange's memoirs. On his way to meet Lange, he sees on TV that Lange is being charged with war crimes for turning over suspected terrorists to the CIA for torture (Apparently only the US and Israel are allowed to do that under the UN charter). He finally meets Lange and his aides and wife (Ruth), only find out Ruth (Olivia Williams) dislikes Lange's aide (Kim Cattrall) and suspects they are having an affair. McGregor shifts gears from Ghostwriter to investigative journalist as he unravels a web of deceit and lies. The movie is long, but it held my interest all the way through.
0545123275|5.0|Could this book have been any better??? Probably not. I seriously loved this book. I've never read a book before that is solely about werewolves and that doesn't include some other type of paranormal creature (vampire, witch, etc.) too, so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect when I began reading Shiver. First off, let me just say that I LOVE the fact that it switches the first person perspective back and forth between Grace and Sam. I really enjoy being able to slip inside each of their heads throughout the story. It's perfect. It's what I wanted to see completed in Midnight Sun (Stephenie Meyer), but didn't get. Thank you Maggie!! You gave us what we wanted! SO many current YA books are first person from the female protagonist's perspective, which is fine, but we rarely get to see things from our leading men's perspectives! It's so wonderful to be able to get into their heads for a change to really see how they feel about their love interests.<br />Another thing I really enjoyed about this book was the fact that the werewolves are seasonal. They change into wolves when it gets too cold and then back into humans in the spring/summer each year. That is so perfect -- much better than the standard old \\"full moon\\" scenario. This links them so much more with nature and makes their predicament more tragic. They can't do anything to stop it and once it's happened, they're stuck that way for months!!<br />I really appreciated the way Grace's character was written also. She was beautifully poised and mature for a 17-year old, but not in an unrealistic way. She was clearly a product of her own upbringing --- her parents sure didn't have much to do with it. They were definitely college kids who never grew up. Poor Grace was left to fend for herself, but wound up doing a pretty good job of it.<br />And the ending was just perfect. It literally made me shiver. Can't wait for Linger!<br /><br />NOTES ON THE AUDIOBOOK NARRATORS:<br />Because this book flipped it's first person narrations between two characters, the audiobook was also narrated by two people. The first is Jenna Lamia. She was absolutely amazing. I've NEVER enjoyed listening to a narrator as much as I loved her. I wish every book could be narrated by her. She was perfect. Not too young-sounding that she came off as annoying or immature, but not too old sounding that it wasn't believable that she was playing a 17-year old. I'd like to see how much acting she's done, because she delivered those lines with the most perfect inflections and emotions. I would highly recommend listening to her narrate ANYTHING!<br />The voice of Sam was narrated by David LeDoux, or as I like to refer to him, David LeDouche. WOW. This guy really wants to be an actor. He sounded like a 40-year old Disney prince. A Disney prince who wants to be on Broadway. Seriously. Who did the casting for this book?? He's supposed to be playing a hot, 18-year old werewolf. He just sounds like somebody's goofy uncle who kind of creeps out all the kids at the family parties. I would (obviously) NOT recommend listening to Mr. LeDouche any time soon, unless you need a good laugh.o characters, the audiobook was also narrated by two people. The first is Jenna Lamia.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Okay ~ I can't believe this is Cyndi Lauper. She was quite popular when I was in high school; but I thought she was annoying and whiny. I never liked her \\"look\\", much less that voice. She's an artist that I just never looked at anymore. Then something happened....I received a promotional e-mail from Amazon on this CD.  I decided to listen to the samples only because about a week before I'd read a review for it in People.  I was in utter shock! Cyndi Lauper??  Seriously?  I bought it.    I decided to play this for my husband in the car; not saying a word. He asked \\"WHO is this? She's great.\\" When I told him it was Cyndi Lauper, he said \\"NO WAY. I don't like Cyndi Lauper.\\"  Guess again Sparky....    My favorites on the CD are \\"Crossroads\\" & \\"How Blue Can You Get?\\"; both with the fantastic Jonny Lang. There is a tiny bit of a Tina Turner sound in her voice.     Bottom line ~ I love it....hope she can continue down this path a while because I'll sure walk it with her.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|You know, as I'm listening to \\"The power of the heart\\", I was reading a review on here, and when the reviewer said about this album \\".... it stares uncomfortably at you\\" it hit home.  As I'm writing, it is my first time listening to this album, and as I'm approaching \\"My body is a cage\\", I already love this album, just because I've been a fan of Gabriel for about 30 years, and because I deeply know where he's going with this project. I won't hide the fact that I've read many comments of these songs on YouTube, and the vast majority of people on YouTube prefer the original versions of the songs, especially Arcade Fire (I saw comments like \\"Awww, they soooo cute!\\"), but it's sad, at the same time, to aknowledge that the vast majority of people do not possess the intellect to be able to comprehend the vast music and lyrics dictionary available to us humans, which Gabriel has mastered himself, and is trying to communicate to humankind.   As a northern Italian myself, I dare comparing Gabriel's knowledge of lyrics and music, to Dante Alighieri in the 1400s.  Can Peter Gabriel be considered the Dante of our time?  Can Peter Gabriel speak to our deepest feelings?  Can Peter Gabriel make us cry?  Can Peter Gabriel express such complex ideas and concepts, with such poetic and musical ease?  Can Peter Gabriel interpret other people's songs and make them his own?  I use this album as evidence for all of the above, but it has been widely demonstrated that not everyone is capable of comprehending Gabriel, hence the title of my review.

B001PPGAK8|2.0|This film was doomed as soon as James Mardesen signed on to be Louis Lane's husband in \\"Superman Returns,\\" which forced writers to kill him of.      Folks also really need to stop blaming Bret Ratner for Cyclops' death. Are you stupid? do you even know what a director does? He has no choice when it comes to story! The film makers had no choice but to kill cyclops off because the actor that plays him was off with the original director making \\"Superman Returns.\\" So if you want to blame someone for why cyclops dies in x3, blame Bryan Singer! He's the one who chose to not finish what he started! Blame actor James Mardesen, who signed on for the most worthless role in his life, playing Louis Lane's husband in a movie that was a complete downer! Bryan Singer really screwed up going for that superman movie instead on finishing his X-Men trilogy. If you listen to the audio commentary, the producers say, we had to limit cyclops' role because James was off making superman returns and was barely around to film. There you go! Stop blaming Bret Ratner for God's sake because all it shows is your ignorance!!    I know what you are thinking. They should have hired another actor but it's not that easy. There are contractual obligations and if they wanted to use another actor they would have to pay James Mardesen thousands of dollars, which a movie studio never wants to do because they constantly want to save money and not go over budget. For example, when they killed Michael Bein off in \\"Alien 3\\" they had to pay him thousands of dollars! He made more money off dying off screen in \\"Alien 3\\" than his whole performance in \\"Aliens\\"! X3 has that \\"Alien 3\\" curse on it, where it's a good movie but there was so much standing in its way that it's not what fans expected.     The only redeeming qualities of this film are Kelsey Grammar as beast and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde. What a waste. I wish i could magically transport their performances into x1 or x2 but not even they could make this filmvery watchable. Halle Berry and Hugh were great too but that ordeal with Cyclops is like a thorn to my side and i can't get over it.    what i hate more than what happened to Cyclops that didn't involve hollywood politics is what they did to rogue. Having her character take the cure goes against everything the x men stand for and with that i can tell you these screenplay writers don't have a clue and are blasphemous when it comes to x men. the x men are all about accepting yourself as you are and learning to control your powers!!! even in the audio commentery the writers say that the ending where she doesn't take the cure is for Rogue fans, so wouldn't they have put that in the film!!? their reasoning was because \\"it sucks that she can't get with nobody.\\" what a bunch of morons. this was like watching someone piss on a church and it hurt me, more than the death of cyclops.    Also the ending is ridiculous so magento who is the equivelant of osama bin laden is just sitting in the park playing chess and no one takes notice even though he was terrorizing the whole country and hundreds of soldiers died on alcatraz!? So, the cure still exists and everyone is happy? so jean come back only to...die again? this film was pointless. blame the screenwriters and the producers but not bret ratner.
B0007Z4S4C|3.0|I stopped listening to Robert Plant a long time ago. I didn't even know this CD was out until I saw re-mixed versions on iTunes. It's what I bought.  I dug them. No lie.    There is just something always empty and missing in his music. I can't quite put my finger on it... oh yes I can; but no amount of infinite love would possibly correct it.    I commend the guy for the effort though.  At least he gets out and plays music he loves. I don't connect-anymore, and haven't since 1985. I've reached the dessert and the end of a musical oasis. Although somewhat sad, its change - like your kid going off to college and onto life. Like other musicians/music, I will re-visit occasionally, but ultimately will move on as I realize this is a micron of sound in a vast ocean of music - an ocean everyone should swim in so jump in folks!    Peace!
B000LTAY1U|2.0|Update:  This watch does not keep correct time, as others have commented.  I have to reset it every couple of days in order it to be at all usefull.  If it wasn't for just buying it and liking its looks I would have already abondoned it.<br /><br />I've been searching for a cool looking utilitarian military watch, that I wouldn't be afraid of scratching.  I'm a female, and there aren't many military watches that fit my wrist or don't look ridiculously over-sized. I have a few ladies Swiss military watches, but they tend to be too dainty looking or bordering on kiddie.<br /><br />I first saw this watch in black while shopping for something else in the mall. It has a good weight, doesn't look junky or cheap, and is much more attractive than pictured.  As other have mentioned, the size of the wrist band seems a bit disproportionate to the face size, however it is made of good material and the color is a perfect deep army green. The pewter finish and hardware are also very nice.  I have to cinch it up to the tightest setting to fit my almost 6 1/2\\" wrist. Overall I'm very pleased I got this watch.<br /><br />I have also debated on getting the JCrew Timex, but it seems that this watch is a bit nicer and not as overpriced as their $20 Timex's they are selling for over triple the price.
B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt may have been overplayed, but when you listen to this entire album,  you get why.  The level of talent displayed is way above what most \\"artists\\" in pop music could ever even hope for.  The image he got in the media and pop music scene isn't really who he is, and through the lyrics, that becomes obvious.  There are curse words and drug references, so if you just like the radio versions of his singles, you may not want to buy this album.  However,  if a little honesty in his lyrics won't bother you, the music is incredible.  Every song is amazing, and the balance between vocals and instruments is perfect.  The songs don't sound the same, but they are cohesive, and the album flows nicely from start to finish.  There is a mix of emotions as well.  The album begins on a note of hope and happiness, and toward the end there are some sad songs.  Beautiful, beautiful music (pun intended).
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I became friends with every major character, despite their tragic flaws.  The acting is superb.  The locations and set are stunning.  This is not a movie for your kid's Social Studies class.  There is full frontal nudity, rough sex, and strong language.  It's very HBO.  I'll do my best to wait until next summer to watch it again.  I'll rewatch Deadwood this winter.

There were many chapters that I could really identify with and look forward to the happier chapters at the end (not there yet). Tony does an exceptional job of describing how corporate culture trumped almost every other aspect of his business and ended up being the most important aspect of his success.<br /><br />If I had 5 minutes I would be interested in asking Tony what he sees for himself in terms for family. Does he want one and how would that affect his outlook on business.
B003O85W3A|5.0|There's a reason why Arcade Fire is David Bowie's favorite band.  Like past albums, Arcade Fire delivers another epic album from start to finish.  \\"The Suburbs\\" opens with one of their classic arrangements and reminds you why you have the album in the first place.  I admit, a month ago when two tracks leaked in lo-fi, it was a bit disappointing.  This is an album that may deliver some favorites (like Neon Bible did), but it is an album that should be listened to in its entirety in the sequence Arcade Fire has designated for you. Learn to not be scared of the evolution the band has taken, it's not an opposite direction but a stride forward in creating a rock opera without having a cheesy storyline and without having to call it a 'rock opera'. \\"The Suburbs\\" is another uplifting arrangement brought to you by some of my favorite Canadians.  An album you can reach for on any day in any mood.

9626343613|5.0|In these days of rampant incivility, when we know far too much about each other, I find it relaxing to escape to the early 19th century and immerse myself in Jane Austen's world. Okay, I'll ignore the lack of plumbing and the whole layered economic system that allows some people to do nothing while others are ground down with toil. Instead, I'll celebrate the courteous manners and the formality of even close relationships.<br />The Dashwood sisters are in a difficult position: their father had two families, the first of which produced a son who inherits all his property, and the second of which produced three daughters who are not entitled to any specific amount -- only what the half-brother (and his greedy wife) thinks is fair. So the girls must find husbands who can support them. Austen's skill is that she can deal with these economic uncertainties and class expectations in many of her novels without being repetitious. Everyone knows the rules of the game, and when impulsive, emotional Marianne goes off the deep end, we are all caught up in the fallout of her disappointment. Elinor has a different disposition and an equally complex set of problems that she must face, albeit alone.<br />The great thing about this audio book, and others in the Naxos series, is that it is read by Juliette Stevenson, who does a wonderful job. Her voices are consistent and her trained (and natural) accent is perfect for Jane Austen. Whether I'm in the car or hunched over a sewing project, an audio book is a perfect companion.

For the uninitiated, I can only suggest this rough comparison: if Golden Girls took place during the grunge movement in the mid-90s and starred two RiotGrrls trying their damnedest to not be consumed by conformity and mediocrity in their suburban high school. So, nothing like the Golden Girls. But if it were, Aunt Amy would totally be Sofia.    Most of the original music was changed for generic but period-appropriate stuff to keep the price down. This is the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. This really hurt one scene in \\"Road Worrier\\", in which REM's Everybody Hurts  provided 90% of the emotion. I don't know how expensive the rights to that one song were, but I doubt they'd break the bank on the DVD. Other places it was much less obvious, but it would have been sweet.    The other reason for 4 stars is the lack of guide material for this 8-disc set. I appreciated the warning note that the music had changed and why, but was hoping for a little more in the case besides the discs. It would have been great if they included at least an insert pairing episode numbers with titles; I had to make my own (props to Outpost Daria for making that easy!) to easily locate  specific episodes I wanted to watch.     The writing is excellent: Daria and Jane are high school outcasts who start a little one-dimensional, but over the course of 5 seasons grow into complete characters who show a number of sizable flaws in addition to their awesome qualities. Really, all of the student characters grow, and through pieces of the stories we get a sense for who they really are. This happens a little with the teachers, but they're not the focus of the show either. The show is uniformly hilarious, and uses black humor to balance teenage awkwardness and a few very serious moments (deciding whether to have sex, alcohol abuse).    Overall, I was really pleased with this set. It was great to be able to watch it all again, and to finally see the movies and final season. The price point is excellent for the amount of content, despite my disappointment at some of the tradeoffs made in production. I expect I'll be rewatching these episodes many times. And maybe I'll dub that part of Road Worrier so I can watch it too.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|This movie is tons of fun. It's a comic book twist on an old war horse where a group of special ops guys get betrayed by their handler (in Bolivia no less) and need to find a way back to the states to exact revenge.     This is generally a well written, well acted, well directed action flick with yuks to spare. The yuks don't come from out and out jokes or gags, they come from the losers' characters themselves. Most of them are well written (Chris Evans is a hoot) which really helps this puppy move. The action scenes have a lot of style and there are a few twists in the plot that keep things from getting too stale.    There is a lot of over the top, impossible stuff happening here and the plot does have some holes in it but you don't care. If there is one complaint I have it's that, in third act, the action gets sincere and much less fun, so it loses some of the niftiness that had been building up throughout. But, all in all, it's still a fun watch.    This doesn't arise above it's comic book, B-Grade roots but you'd be hard pressed to have a better time while watching. Grab a beer and some pizza and have at it.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|This was excellent --- beyond my expectations.  Did not see in in the movie theater when it first came out.  Discovered the beautiful haunting music first and then only saw parts of the film on television over the years.  It is a wonderful story of courage and determination -- even though heart-wrenching at times.  Barbra Streisand is tremendous and have to give her credit for making a film which doesn't make her very feminine or attractive.  A huge Bravo! from me.

0061120081|4.0|I never saw the movie and this was the first time I read the book. I'm 45! So I wanted to so what the big deal was. Normally I wouldn't read this type of book. To me in short it was good. Not fantastic or anything and I probably wouldn't read it again. If you were a teacher, say grade school. This would be the classic thats read out loud to and with the students.
006176759X|2.0|The story is week and requires you to buy the second book to find out how it ends.  I was a big fan of the show but this book starts out awkwardly written and just goes nowhere.  A better book for teens is Sloppy Firsts and a better book for Chick-lit fans is Can You Keep a Secret.

0307454541|1.0|I really agree with those who feel that this is a poorly written, pretentious, over praised piece of nonsense.  It is full of cliches, lucky happenstances and deus ex machinae.  What more can I say?  I found the sequel at a good price and bought it before I started Dragon.  What a huge mistake.  The movie makes all the defects even more clear.  Avoid both at all costs.

0060090367|4.0|Watermelon is the first book by Marian Keyes that I've read.  I was very excited to read the book after seeing the reviews for it.  So excited that I bought more of her books without reading one of hers first.  Overall it was a good book.      It had a new spin on humor.  I liked how Claire had names for her subconscious personalities.  Claire was a good character most of the time.  At one point I wanted to smack her because of how blind she was to the truth of what was happening in her life with James.  Thankfully Claire wised up.  There were also lots of funny little sayings.  Claire's family was interesting.  Helen was spoiled, Anna didn't seem to stand up for herself, Claire's dad was a push over, and the mother was all over the place.  Marian did a good job of creating a dynamic family.  By the end I was scared the book was going to end badly, but the ending was good.  I wanted to read more when it ended to find out what happened to Claire.      The only reason I couldn't give the book five stars was because it took me almost a 100 pages to get into it.  The story seemed to drag along until about then and after that I couldn't stop reading it.
B002ZG997C|1.0|This is the first time I've had a DVD that absolutely prohibited me from bypassing the trailers & commercials, and there are a lot on this Warner Home Video disc. I was so frustrated and p----d off that I just returned the disc to Netflix unwatched. And I was absolutely in awe of the movie when I saw it in theater. Maybe most people are used to being force-fed commercials, marketing and promotions of all sorts, but I'm just a person that does not like being coerced and it bothered me that much. I'm posting this message in hopes that maybe others will concur and somehow the Hollywood jerks like those at Warner Home Video who do this will get the message that their overbearing, contemptuous attitudes toward consumers are making some people MAD AS HELL AND WE AREN'T TAKING IT ANYMORE. After years of resistence, I am now driven by Warner Home Video toward the bootleg market. It's the only place I can go, hopefully, to watch this outstanding movie without being forced to watch their annoying commercials.

030726999X|5.0|Picking up right where _The Girl Who Played With Fire_ left off, Larsson adds several more layers in _Hornet's Nest_ to an already complex story line:  Lisbeth Salander is in critical condition with a bullet wound to the head, Zalachenko just down the hall.  Neidermann has escaped police custody and is at large, and an array of adversaries plot to put Salander back into a mental institution - this time for life.  In the meantime Blomkvist works to clear Salander's name and uncover the truth of Zalachenko and his relation with the Swedish national security arm, while the staff of Millenium wrestle with challenges unique to the publishing industry.<br /><br />Unlike _The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_, the pace of _Hornet's Nest_ is much faster, Larsson juggling several concurrent storylines at once.  The plot itself - of a secret branch within the security service is a little tired (Le Carre, Tom Clancy and others have done this as well), and a little improbable, but this is fiction afterall, and it *does* make for page-turning reading.  The casual references to places, highways and local landmarks may be a distraction to some readers, but I have always felt it gave a clearer sense of setting, therefore it wasn't an issue for me.  As with his earlier books, all lose ends are neatly tied together:  justice is served, good is rewarded, evil is punished.  All in all, a satisfying ending to the trilogy.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding trite, those who have read and enjoyed the previous books in the trilogy will no doubt be pleased with this one as well; those who didn't care for the first installment will no doubt pass on the rest.  In looking at the body of Larsson's work, a common thread becomes apparent.  As he writes in _Hornet's Nest_, \\"...this story is not primarily about spies and secret government agencies; its about violence against women, and the men who enable it.\\"  Perhaps this, more than anything is what has so resonated with me in the series.  It is regretable that there will be nothing more forthcoming from Larsson, but what he had written was both very entertaining and sends a powerful message.will be nothing more forthcoming from Larsson, but what he had written was both very entertaining and sends a powerful message.

B000002L9Y|3.0|Fleetwood Mac's last grasp at their former glory slips through their hands, though to be fair, they hold on for all their mite.<br /><br />By no means a horrible record, but it is no stellar disk either. More \\"edgy\\" than 1982's 'Mirage' to keep Lindsey Buckingham happier, but not as edgy or creative as 'Tusk'.  Trying to manuver that tightrop is really their failing.  They don't succeed at being pop or distinctive.<br /><br />Yes, there are stand-out tracks and even decent radio hits, but nothing grasps, let alone holds, me for any length of time.<br /><br />\\"Big Love\\" is certainly a worthy song.  Better live, for sure, but the studio recording is good, even if McVie or Nicks do not actually sing on it. Buckingham refused to say who did the 'oohs and aaahs' when it was clear it was just him doing all the vocals with some sonic manipulation.  Most of his songs were basically solo works that he slapped the Fleetwood Mac moniker on to keep the band happy, while keeping him as happy as possible.<br /><br />Buckingham's title track is actually quite good. And while \\"You and I (part II)\\" is good, the left off 'part I' is phenomenal.  A totally missed opportunity.<br /><br />Christine McVie fairs best commercially here. She had the biggest hits with \\"Everywhere\\" and \\"Little Lies\\". They are no big stretchs in creativity, though I like her change-up in style when it comes to \\"Isn't it Midnight\\". The vocals are a little muddied, though that was a purposeful decision from the band or producers.<br /><br />Nicks does not fair as well as the other two. \\"Seven Wonders\\", while good for pop, is not really hers.  Written by Sandy Stewart and tweaked by Nicks to receive songwriting credit, it begins to show the strain on her vocals that would continue to deteriorate over the next decade. Unlike others here, I think \\"Welcome to the Room...Sara\\" is just a mess. And Nicks' claims that she took off her vocals at the end of \\"When I See You Again\\" not telling Buckingham seems far-fetched at best. With her three solo albums during the six years prior to 'Tango' she clearly had used up her best material before hitting the recording studio with the band.<br /><br />Oddly, I like most of the music on here on an individual basis, but not for an entire sitting. It's not cohesive. 'Mirage' gets a worse rap, but it's more of a band album than 'Tango'.t best.

0439023483|4.0|A Famous Person once said: \\"Can love bloom on the battlefield?\\"    The answer, in the case of the Hunger Games, is No.     The setting for the Hunger Games is in the near future, when everything has been bombed to smithereens and the only civilization left is the Capitol and its surrounding twelve Districts. Every year the Capitol forces one girl and one boy from each district into a giant arena where they fight to the death, on TV, simply to remind everyone that the Capitol is in charge. The last one standing gets fame and fortune.    Sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen is selected to be one of the victims from District 12. Her hunting skills and knowledge of the forest are helpful, but to win the support of the audience she must pretend to fall in love with her District 12 male counterpart, Peeta.    It becomes one of the most confusing love stories I have ever read.    The story itself is fine, insofar as a story about children murdering each other can be fine. There is plenty of suspense, action, outwitting of enemies, survival, explosions, and occasional humor. The setting is descriptive and the characters are well rounded. But throughout the whole book you have to also deal with a semi-fake-romance between Katniss and Peeta.    The book is written in first-person from Katniss' point of view. From the very beginning, we are told that she only puts up with the romance to get support from the rich audience, who in turn might send down helpful gifts or tools into the arena to help them survive. Unfortunately she also knows that Peeta really does like her, and so you end up with a convoluted love triangle of which one point is the entire population of the city.    It's one of those situations where the reader understands and predicts things much, much faster than the characters do. Katniss describes Peeta as a nice, generous, strong, giving, attractive person, and then spends the majority of the book annoyed that she has to pretend to be in love with him. Much of myreading was spent waiting for the eventual \\"Katniss eventually falls in love with Peeta\\" chapter.     It would be like Sherlock Holmes identifying the culprit as a large, balding man with a walrus mustache and then spending the majority of the book obliviously buying pastries from the large, balding, mustache-d baker. We are never given a reason why Katniss does not actually like Peeta, other than a weak \\"there's another boy back home who I am also indifferent towards\\" excuse.    I really want to like the Hunger Games. The story and setting are unique and interesting, and set up nicely for more in the same world. But the awkward love triangle, where Peeta loves Katniss, Katniss wants to please the audience and so pretends to love Peeta, and the audience wants to watch them die for sadistic entertainment, just makes no sense. It would be better if we were given a reason why Katniss doesn't like Peeta in return, but we never do.    And for someone named Peeta, we sure do see him eat a lot of animals.
1140418041|2.0|`Howards End' is not E.M. Forster's best work and it should not be used as compulsory reading in schools. It is not a vibrant portrait of Edwardian English society. The characters are not wonderful. The novel is rather a boring confrontation of types (not characters), like the cold, cheating plutocrat, the independent suffragette, the bowing servant, the unemployed downtrodden or the germanophile.  `Having a mistress' or `unwelcome' engagements do not stir scandalous remarks today. They are cheered in popular newspapers with big headlines.    Technically, the novel is far from flawless. One example: the introduction, the interventions and the final act of the poor family (the Basts) are clumsy, artificial and improbable, and that all the more in a novel about `property', where Leonard Bast is an insurance clerk.    The overall atmosphere is too sentimental with many overreactions and a lot of superficial dialogues.  This is not a good introduction to E. M. Forster's work. A far better one is `Where Angels Fear to Tread.'   Only for E.M. Forster fans.
B003JTHESA|4.0|I have had the time over the last few days to digest The Final Frontier. I think this is a strong album for Maiden at this point in their career. While listening you can really hear parts that remind you of Somewhere In Time...a few of the songs and licks bring to mind Back to the Village and Piece of Mind era....But the album as a whole sounds like Somewhere in Time and SSOASS as if it was made at this point in their career...The days of old are long gone so get over it...Iron Maiden are at a different point in their career(album is more polished but still gritty and progressive)....I really Loved AMOLAD(5+ stars) that album has been played from start to finish so many times it reminds of those days long ago when u could listen from start to finish and enjoy the album as a whole.....The Final Frontier is starting to do the same it really does take a few listens to digest....I cant see giving it 1 star nor could I give it 5 stars...if your point of view is \\"well this is the best they can do at this point\\" ...then I can see 5 stars...I think it deserves a solid 4. Because this is a solid album from a band that refuses to ever sellout or listen to the critics. Go buy the album, shoot buy the vinyl for that nostalgic sound :)
0743298039|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield centers around the life of reclusive author, Vida Winter, who has spent the last few years creating a series of alternate lives for herself.  Now ill and  nearing the end of her life, Miss Winter decides it is time to tell the truth and come clean about the events of her life. Thus she sets her sites on, Margaret Lea, a biographer more interested in the dead that lie in books and archives then in living subjects. However, when Margaret receives a letter from Miss Winter inviting her to her home, her curiosity is piqued and she begins reading Miss Winter's most famous collection of short stories.  Margaret goes to see Miss Winter unsure of whether or not she should accept the offer to be the biographer of a woman who has lied to so many journalists in the past, and just when she thinks she makes up her mind, Miss Winter draws her in with one simple sentence: \\"Once upon a time, there were twins.\\"    The novel consists largely of Vida Winter's narration of her past telling the story of a house in Angelfield and of her parents, Isabelle and Charlie, and the staff The Missus and John-the-Dig.  Miss Winter's narration of her past and Angelfield is juxtaposed with Margaret's own musings about her own twin sister.  Told with the pace of the mystery, The Thirteenth Tale expertly weaves ends of several stories into a wonderful tapestry of sisterhood and friendship with books being the epicenter of this lovely novel.    The book reads much like a work of classic literature with a setting that reminded me of an old estate and a large garden and the absence of any modern day technology to draw away from the drama and feeling of the story.  In a sense the little aspects of this book are so subtle and slight that once the story concludes and the mystery of Vida Winter's wife is solves, the tiny insignificant things seem to have a greater purpose in the plot.  In this fashion, The Thirteenth Tale remains a page turning experience while at the same time keeping the simple yet sophisticated narrative voice of reluctant Margaret Lea.    In retrospect, it is hard for me to find anything at fault with the story,  while some chapters did seem to rage on about certain niche areas of literary history, in hindsight, most of the prose and the theoretical games posed by Miss Winter's narrative are worthwhile and in the end leave the reader looking at symbols that are so slight and delicate that a reader with a cursory glance would never even register that they were there.    I have to say that I was very sorry to see this book end. The story was so original and crafted so beautifully that I am looking forward to see what else Diane Setterfield has up her sleeve in her future literary efforts.  In the meantime as we await another literary masterpiece by Setterfield, I recommend picking up a copy of Her Fearful Symmetry by Audrey Niffenegger for another story of twins and ghosts that is sure to please those with insatiable appetites for books about sisters and ghosts.    Final Grade: A-

Originally read when it was first released and was totally disgusted by the self-absorption and didn't understand the popularity.  Then OPRAH had to put her on.   So many seemed to like this book.  Hello, it'd been done before..  Everyone should GROW UP ALREADY.  Perhaps she should've volunteered in a country where there is real human suffering, (especially to women) the Middle east, Africa, etc.  Then her life would be in perspective.  All of you glowing reviewers should think about THAT!  Perhaps the proceeds to the books, movie, and all this merchandise should go to a worthy charity.  American hedonism, materialism, selfishness at it's worst.  If you're curious, check it out at your local library--donate the money saved to a worthy charitable cause.  NUFF SAID.

0545140315|1.0|The reason why I read this book was because my friend had read it, and loved it.(?)  Well, let me just say, getting through this book was NOT an easy task. First off, the author was trying far too hard to sound like a \\"modern\\" teen. Well, someone should let her know that teens today do NOT say \\"what to the ev.\\" Secondly, I felt like these characters had the depth of a piece of paper.   The heroin, Penny Lane Bloom, starts the Lonely Hearts Club because her heart was shattered by deadbeat longtime bud/crush, Nate. The club's members are not allowed to date, due to the trouble and pain past boyfriends have caused in their young lives. But even as the book progresses, and the anti-boys club is in full swing, boys are still the main occurence in Penny Lane's shallow, Beatles loving mind. Reading this book made me feel like I was back in high school, and not in a good way (if there is a good way.) The book is filled with trivial, pointless blah-blah-blah, teenage cliches, and the same thoughts over and over. And the ending, and who Penny ends up with, is extremely predictable. And don't get me started on Tracy, in the running for most annoying character (and sidekick) of all time. (she actually keeps a list with her at all times of the the most eligible boys at their school to date. Seriously.)  In summary, do not read this book. It will take your brain cells and give you nothing in return.

B002ZG995E|5.0|In all sincerity, well done fellas - this is terrific.    In the last decade, my opinion of american film makers verged to purely ridiculous lows. I had agreed to bring my younger son to the movies that particular Saturday, and while this was the obvious choice for him (I-want-to-grow-up-and-fight-the-Daleks), and I don't imagine where he got that from, I truly didn't know what I was expecting. There have been so many wolves in sheep's clothing in the last few years, from unprocessed propaganda of the worst sort (Hurt Locker) to the weird and wonderful - far too many to mention - I kind of imagined this movie that we were about to see as being the equivalent of an hour or more of Newt Gingrich bawling and howling at the viewer through a megaphone to the tune of \\"home of the free\\".    Or something.    No, I was quite incorrect. This movie is EXCELLENT, in literally every way - a very clever and well crafted tale. Pure popcorn wonderment, the sort of thing that will provoke dads everywhere to whisper to their kids \\"I remember DOING THIS stuff when you were, you know, too young to bring along\\". The screen play works well, meaning by that the ideas weld well together visually, and you can really feel your way through it.    Not to mean that it is exactly easy on the eye. I mean, some of the action is fairly extreme and it hurts to imagine it happening; but this is also a tribute to the excellent camerawork, more than that I can't say because I have never done outdoor stuff on what is obviously a huge scale, and they do it so well here.    Special effects? I should say so. I really hold to the idea that the real special effects occur when you sense the gross injustice and the sheer boiling rage that lies just below the skin of these characters, but again, it works well, and the accompanying huge-things-flying-about bits are about on par; but you would have a good film without any of it.    It's sad to now think that I never saw the original A-team TV series at all, but Ireckon after this I will do so.    By the way, what is this about the A-team appearing WITHIN the A-team? Watch and you will know what I mean. By the way, that particular little scene got a massive cheer from the rather excitable audience I went to see this with; that audience gradually morphed from a conventional mixture of Dads and kids to something like a crowd of drunken football fan rabble as the movie progressed, so you can imagine what the whole thing was like and how great it was to be there.    What was it then? Manic, unpredictable, and very, very enjoyable at the very least.    Very highly recommended.    More please!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I can honestly say that Claire Danes' performance in this movie was THE best performance in the history of acting. She did such a phenomenal job portraying Temple Grandin that I had to continuously remind myself throughout the movie that it wasn't Temple herself. Not only did Claire Danes do a stunning acting job, the story of Temple Grandin is one to be admired. She is a true hero in my opinion. What a beautiful masterpiece.
B003JTHESA|3.0|As a longtime Maiden fan, I think I can honestly say that this album is a minor dissapointment for me even though it pains me to say it. I somewhat like about half of the songs on the album, love about a quarter and dislike the other quarter. I think the biggest problem with The Final Frontier is the pacing. There are simply too many longer tracks for one album, and some tracks (Mother of Mercy, Isle of Avalon and Starblind especially) don't really go anywhere and don't have much of a chorus to hook the listner in. The album starts strong (minus the way too long intro) and finishes very strong with \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" and \\"When the Wild Wind Blows.\\" It's unfortunate that those two very long songs are back-to-back because it hurts both of them. I think this album neaeed two or three more shorter,heavier songs like the title track to balance things out,and a few less of those mid-tempo songs that I can't imagine anybody going crazy for.    Should you buy it? It's Iron Maiden, of course you should buy it! There are still four or five strong tracks here that if you add up their length are probably longer than the first few entire albums the band made, so that's one way to look at it, right?
145283668X|5.0|I love this story. For a long time it had been one of those that I \\"have always wanted to read.\\"  Here, Stevenson has beautifully told a story that, really, even in his day wasn't new. The paradox that good and evil exists in every human being is as classic as the beginning of human history itself; and a phenomenon that has played out throughout history ever since.  Far from being unoriginal however, Stevenson has given artful life and breath to this duality through the characters, time, and places in this book.  And with this edition, Cricket House has creatively built on the legacy of beauty found in the story.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This show is a truly great one.  What I've noticed is that some may have watched only the first 2 episodes, and didn't give it a proper chance.  The reason I say this is that the first 2 episodes are a pilot, and pretty much offers you only a foundation of what's to come.  There isn't a real SPARTACUS until episode 5 and if you are watching you won't be able to take your eyes off it.    The best part of this series coming out on DVD or Blu-ray is that you won't have to wait until next week to catch the next episode.  Trust me.  It was quite painful waiting.  Since this show was on Starz it didn't get the total audience it would have if it were on HBO or Showtime, but this show can more than hold its own against any of those network's greatest shows.  Yes, that includes my beloved DEXTER, and my guilty pleasure TRUE BLOOD.      Starz has a winner here.  Just like FX has Sons of Anarchy.  If you don't like a well written story with some shocking twists, this show is not for you.  If you are not entertained by sex or the naked bodies of beautiful people, then this is not for you.  If you can't handle gore or violence, this is not for you.  If you do not enjoy  Love stories, or competitive rivalries..this is not for you.   If you enjoy any or all of these things, by all means get this series!!
B003TOMAPC|2.0|it was an ok movie, nothing special.  The movie was like a combination of sin city and kill bill geared toward kids and parents.  I would not watch it again.
1892005034|5.0|The teachings in this book are easy to read and comprehend. I have applied them immediately in my workplace and was delighted with the results. It adds on as a great management skill. I particularly liked the chapter on \\"Anger\\".  Out of experience and observations I have noted that when one comes away angry out a conversation one tends to look for a sympathizer. The sympathizer is usually a close friend or a relative who listens \\"understandingly\\" to all the details of the event. Feeling understood by the listener more bad points about the person who \\"made\\" one mad in the first place begin to emerge. The listener usually will add on some social values and declare the behavior absolutely unacceptable. Hence the anger is legitimized the relationship with the person who \\"made\\" one mad becomes irreparably damaged. Empathy works very well in diffusing the situation and leaves all possibilities open to express one's feelings and get what one needs. I used this in my family to help a loved one to resolve an issue when she came back angry with somebody at work. With \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" at work, She is still friends with the person who she thought was responsible for her anger.    I think if Mahatma Gandhi had read this book he would have been delighted at Dr. Rosenberg's contribution to Non Violence.
0553386816|1.0|I have always been a huge Grisham fan and have read every one of his books.  This, without a doubt, was the worst book I have ever read.  Grisham has had some books that have been iffy but this was not even close to entertaining.  The stories began with great potential and then he left the reader wondering, \\"What was that?\\" Thank God this book was a gift.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I received this book as a birthday gift while on vacation.  I'm a big dog person, so it had to be good.  Started reading right away.  Three days later, we lost our own dog while we were still away from home.  Not sure if it was divine intervention or what, but it was a very timely read for me.  Loved the story (especially the zebra and the crows). Loved how it gives us a glimpse at just what our pets might be thinking as well as the wonderful gifts they give us.  I've come to realize those much more now that Maddie is gone.  Great book.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Everything seems to be fine with the DVD and the shipping time was good.
B003HARV98|5.0|This album is, quite simply, amazing. Marina has her own unique voice and genre, and what a refreshing break from all the \\"club\\" pop. not that you can't dance to this album, but you won't find her singing \\"DJ, TURN IT UP!\\" it's fun to sing along with, and the fact that this pop is unique makes it even better. It's a little bit ke$ha, katy perry, and has a color scheme of gold, hot pink, royal blue, and purple.     Standout tracks: Hollywood and Girls    This album is totally worth spending your money on!
B00007DWRZ|5.0|Tribalistas by three great musicians: Marisa Monte, Arnaldo Antunes y Carlinhos Brown is a rare and unique album. Love buying at Amazon!
1439190275|5.0|Not too much to add to the many rave reviews other than I LOVE the updates on the fast food and restaurant meals! I've done many burgers sans the bun, but am glad to know that Miso soup gets a thumbs up in the Japanese restaurants. And babaganoosh at my fave Middle Eastern restaurant. I've always tried to use common sense when doing Atkins and eating out, but this book clears up a few minor issues. And I no longer have to feel guilty when I have my one great cup of coffee with heavy cream in the morning!
B00003CXB4|4.0|would have been five stars... except for the new song they added... i really dont like it.  it does not seem to be as well composed as the others and is jarring when you see it for the first time and you are really familiar with the old version.  otherwise, it's a great dvd
0805091742|5.0|Persuasive and compelling from start to finish, Gawande has written a gem.  Who knew that checklists could be so interesting, or so important as an organizing principle to enable better professional performance?  The singular achievement of this book is to convince you that checklists can (and should) apply to many more endeavors than just aviation's famous pre-flight checklist.  Given the pedestrian ho-hum associations I had of checklists it's remarkable to be convinced of the radical improvements enabled by something so simple.  Far from being robotic instructions that switch off thinking, a well implemented checklist empowers performance and innovation, especially in any complex undertaking.  Gawande repeatedly illustrates the power of checklists by using case histories drawn from his own professional world (he's a practicing surgeon: wow, such interesting things happen in an operating room!).  But he also draws from many other professional walks of life, everything from skyscraper construction to hedge fund analysis.  Like only the best kind of non-fiction writing can do, Gawande's book doesn't just show you the data and pattern of a better idea, it promotes and enables insights as you read the book.  I had many ah-ha! moments when I could connect the dots and see exactly how to profitably use checklists in my own work.  Manifesto indeed!
B0011N1WE8|4.0|Penelope has what any good fairy tale needs -<br />A once upon a time beginning - check.<br />Damsel in distress, locked away from a normal life - check.<br />A curse - check.<br />A man or two willing to be her knight in shining armor - check.<br />Our damsel questioning just what would truly make for a happily ever after ending - check.<br />Us learning whether or not she gets that ending - check.<br /><br />Though occasionally slow, Penelope is a very charming movie.
B002ZG997C|5.0|First I must give a testimony to Amazon.  I moved in the midst of the first order and after waiting for a reasonable period I inquired about the order and noted it had gone to my old address even though they I had changed the order. They immediately gave me a refund and sent the DVD out again. In contrast, one of their competitors also did the same thing and elected to debate with me on who was wrong and when I changed my address in their system.<br /><br />This movie is excellent and whether you are a Christian or not you can appreciate the value of the written word will always survive war, technology, famine or any other Act of God or man because we truly need a foundation to base our behavior good or bad.
B000A6EXNO|5.0|I don't know what happened to some users of this accessory, but I didn't have any problem installing it in about one minute or so, and using it for a long time on my D700 without any of the exposed problems. The installing instructions sheet is as easy to read and follow as it can be. My DK-19 eyecup is put on at all times, and as someone said, it should have come included as OEM with the camera. It used to be a standard accessory in some cameras of the 70's and 80's. The possibility of keeping out extraneous light from the viewfinder, especially in very sunny environments, makes it an ideal device in the task of focusing and composing. And you can easily fold it in place if you don't need it at some times. One additional bonus: it keeps your eye and face away from the viewfinder lens and camera back screen, minimizing smudging them. The only drawback in using it, I suppose, is that if you wear glasses (I don't), it may limit your visual through the viewfinder.
B003NHRIUW|2.0|I gave this two stars because it was not well put together. Seeing the trailer, it looks like great movie but after I saw it, I was bitterly disappointed because the movie was all over the place, poor character development, no chemistry, random scenes. It's supposed to be a love story right? Or at least I expected it to be, but the relationship between Ronnie and Will is not any different from everyday life that you see with teenagers. Everything felt forced. What is good about this movie?--The movie trailor, the movie cover, the music video, beautiful people, and the scenery. It would have been alot better if she sang a song in the movie or something. There wasn't anything special about this movie. ...
B003O86MY8|5.0|Also was fine - I have the CD after 1,5 weeks! GREAT! Thank you and best wishes from Germany!
B002LW9ITY|5.0|My son still plays with the special cars that came with this set and the movie itself is GREAT!
B002ZG9846|5.0|A positive review. What got me is this is totally realistic. The nerdy kid, buys a costume on amazon :) then gets stabbed in the gut and hit by a car by a jerk who doesn't even stop to see if he's alive. I was tempted to stop watching right there, but the characters were too good. I was worried there would be a bunch of teenagers out there who would don a wet suit and fight crime,  I don't think so.  The rest of the movie where Mindy starts actually doing all the ass kicking is brilliantly enthralling and heart aching to watch. I even loved Red Mist,  who they kept alive at the end of the movie for kickass number2...  Who wouldn't want a one girl/boy hit team to knock off the mafia once and for all? Big Daddy realizes that the \\"good guys\\" aren't going to do it as they are themselves entangled with the mob. The story has been told before if you listen to the news. I know we will never have a real life Mindy to slay the scumbags for us, but we can enjoy it while it lasts.  As for seeing a little girl do all this killing, it seemed exactly like a game to her which made it ok.  Nicolas Cage's character had already made all the sacrifices and was not about to have his little girl be helpless, which is what caused the mother's death. Empowering ouselves to be able, like Kick Ass to stand up to bullies and not be victims. Speak softly and carry a big bazooka.   As someone who hates violent movies, this one actually got to me in a good way. Once I got past all the red paint, I enjoyed  watching Mindy chop em up. I might even take up taekwando.
B002ZG9788|4.0|I don't know what people expect these days !!  I thought it was a well done remake (with a slightly different story)  with GREAT special effects.  :o)  Well worth the watch.  A lot of people are NEVER happy about any movie they see,..........  They think they're director's ,etc. !  Funny,...............................
0385341008|5.0|This book was a delightful quick read.  I normally do not like books written in letter form, but in this case it worked beautifully, revealing just a little more of each character in each letter and still managing to portray a central character without any letters.  I knew very little about the occupation of Guernsey, so loved learning about this part of WW2.  Enchanting characters in a unique setting.  Great beach read.
B0034G4OU4|3.0|In \\"Eat Pray Love\\" you are going to see a lot of Julia Roberts as Liz exhibiting every possible facial expression for the doting camera that couldn't seem to get enough close-ups of her. This is a long movie which seems even longer than it is. We are going on a quest with Liz to Rome, to an ashram in India, and to Bali. I think she's looking for the meaning of her life, although I'm not quite sure because the movie seems to be sending out a lot of mixed messages.<br />Liz wakes up to find her marriage is a failure, and I never do quite figure out what's wrong with it. Do people mumble in movies these days, is the sound track turned down too low, or am I going deaf? Then she falls in love (maybe) with an aspiring actor, but that fizzles out so she goes searching the world for sustenance, revelation, and romance.<br />In Rome she meets a passel of friends, but mainly she seems to be pigging out on the delicious Italian food. I have never seen Italian food so attractively and lovingly photographed. Of the three locations, Rome is conveyed more thoroughly and evocatively than the other stops.<br />When she gets to the ashram in India, she finds that the lady guru is off in New York so she has to learn meditation from others. We really see only the ashram and don't see much of India. At the ashram she meets Richard, a man who really is in bad mental shape (played excellently by Richard Jenkins).<br />Did you ever get one of those fortune cookies at the end of a Chinese dinner which contains the blandest, most generic piece of advice you could find, advice that can fit anyone and doesn't offend anyone? That's the way I feel about this movie. Liz keeps meeting people including a medicine man in Bali who come up with handy aphorisms, truisms, palliatives, and nostrums which seem inane and goofy. She gets a lot of counsel and meets happy couples, but this chick has to keep looking, searching, discovering, looking...<br />Borrowing a line from the movie: unless you buy a lottery ticket, you can't win the lottery of life. Everywhere Liz seems to be having epiphanies and gaining insights. Some people in the theater walked out in India and never did get to Bali where she met Mr. Right. Don't ask me why he was the right guy. He badly needed a shave, was a sensitive guy, but so were the other two in her life. Is it a feel-good movie? Hard to say. She's a confused gal who left me in the dark, hoping the Bali section wouldn't be too draggy.n't win the lottery of life. Everywhere Liz seems to be having epiphanies and gaining insights.

B002DYKP8S|5.0|Amazon has incorrectly labeled this edition as \\"2-Disc Blu-ray with DVD + Digital Copy.\\"  The correct description is what appears on the box cover: \\"Blu-Ray + Digital Copy.\\"  Disc 1 is the Blu-ray version, while Disc 2 only a downloadable digital copy.  Neither disc is playable on a standalone DVD player.

B003UESJJC|5.0|In addition to collecting everything from the previous theatrical & redux editions as well as including the \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" documentary and many other extras, this blu-ray edition corrects the poor decision to tamper with the aspect ratio on the previous DVD releases. Vittorio Storaro, the acclaimed cinematographer of this and many other films, has, in recent years, gone on a crusade to advocate 2.00:1 as the most desirable widescreen ratio. Because he was the original cinematographer he was, unfortunately, allowed to carve the previous DVD release transfer down from its original 2.35.1 ratio to 2.00.  This meant cropping off portions of the original image. Criterion also allowed him to do it with the recent reissue of \\"The Last Emperor\\" to similarly poor effect. I'm glad that the producers of this edition heeded the concerns of film fans and restored the movie to its original format. It's on my Christmas list!

B000BBOUU4|4.0|This movie was interesting... but I grew up watching the 1971 version of the Roald Dahl book and I am spoiled for any other version. Gene Wilder was untouchable as Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp was awesome and brought a new sort of life to the character but still not Willy Wonka like. I know this movie is a unique adaptation of the book, so it would have a different \\"feel\\" but once you watch the version directed by Mel Stuart everything else is just a second rate imitation.     If you have never seen the 1971 version then watch the remake first or you may be disappointed. :)    [[ASIN:B0009FGWLW Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Special Edition)]]

B0036EH3X4|5.0|Now, I can certainly understand why some people would want the final batch of episodes to be nothing more than an unrelenting assault of answers, but in the end, wouldn't that have made LOST just as plain and predictable as the rest of the junk on television nowadays? No, this series has been so much more than that, and considering it's consistently remained fresh season in, season out, I would expect nothing less for its final hurrah.    Full 5-Star review here.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|I am by no means a \\"trekkie\\" and have seen only a handful of original episodes in syndication over the years. I can understand the viewpoint of hardcore purists who oppose remastering, altering, or adding CG effects to these classic epiosdes. That being said, from this casual fan's perspective, all changes made to the original series for this DVD release are breathtaking and most appropriate. The color, clarity, and sound is stunning, a modern re-recording of the classic intro theme is \\"music to my ears\\", and all effects (especially shots of the Enterprise) are a sheer delight to watch. It makes Star Trek better. Sitting through old grainy footage and a soundtrack recorded on now antiquated equipment would be a torture for today's sci-fi audience. The beauty of this \\"special edition\\" (because that's what it is) is that it blends and works... unlike a lot of what George Lucas added to his Star Wars movies... these changes and updates aren't overdone and integrate seemlessly into the rest of the original scenes. I love Star Trek now and watch every episode with edge-of-my-seat fervor! This was never the case previously. I strongly recommend this DVD release and suspect that seasons 2 & 3 are equally well-done. It's an honor to the series, not the detriment closed-minded trekkies would have you believe. BEAM ME UP!!!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Season 6 was different from previous seasons, but just as great in it's own way.    Haters will always find reasons to hate, if it had followed the same formula as the previous 5 they'd be saying \\"same old schtick\\"    You'll get the answers you weren't able to figure out on your lonesome with the mini bonus episode.    The rest ? Try using your brains and your imaginations.    Failing that, just post 1-star reviews and cut and paste (sic) your counter-reviews everywhere you go.
0143118420|1.0|I don't get it. Why do smart, intelligent, emotionally unstable writers think we might find delight in reading about it? Don't bother. Elizabeth Gilbert is selfish, self-centered and self-absorbed. She knows what she needs to do, doesn't do it and thought it wiser to make money, write a book about the horribly depressing and uninspiring story of her privileged life (no sympathy from me) and laugh at the suckers who bought it and got nothing. Get a life! (I like my motherhood, 20+ year marriage and all the ups and downs that go with husband, kids, pets, homes, jobs, etc.) I won't finish the book and it's the first and last Elizabeth Gilbert book I will ever buy! What a bummer.

B003WKOU0G|5.0|I feel drunk with joy after watching this movie. This movie is a celebration of the babyhood experiences that connect us all, even if the details of our beginnings differ. This movie is not about celebrity babies, nor is it about babies in extraordinary circumstances. This movie is about babies in different parts of the world who live like millions of other babies and who inspire joy just be being.     The film does not impose a voiceover or running commentary on the babies--it lets the babies express themselves. The camera is a quiet and compassionate witness to four babies who captivated me without using words. The film is visually stunning, the music quietly beautiful. I was left with the feeling of LOVE--love for the babies and for the filmmakers who honored them.     The impulse behind this movie--celebrating new life and the extraordinary in the ordinary life of a baby--inspired me to write a memoir about my own baby. (I'm not comparing my book to the film, but I think that if you liked this film you would like my book.)

B001V7UXG2|5.0|Quite fun to watch.  The whole family enjoys this series.  Trust Jeeves to solve any and all predicaments.  I only wish that there were more episodes.    One slightly annoying thing is that the non-American's who are supposed to be American have rather odd accents.  I've not noticed this on other productions, as it is not unusual for me to just assume someone IS American from their speech and find out from the \\"Special features\\" of a DVD that their normal speech has a rather heavy accent that one might expect from someone from their home country (NZ, Australia, any of the UK, etc).
B003JTHETY|5.0|The packaging of the Mission Edition is a bit funky. I had to send back the 1st one I got as it was dented. But the album itself is amazing! Every time I think I have a favorite song, I hear something different in another that makes me rethink that opinion. Sure it's not a classic Maiden album. But it will become a classic!

This is one of the worst records every made in rock history, especially following up Verve 4th, on of the great ones, or even compared to Songs for Lovers, which I am quite fond of. This review is written by a person who is not put off by the religious themes, either, and someone who generally finds something to like in all of Ashcroft's solo work, loves Catch the Meaning, and doesn't try to get into the Verve versus Ashcroft press ; just for perspective.  \\"Are You Ready\\" is the hook. The rest of it as as bad as it can get. Beware! I bought it and found ot!
B002ZG977Y|2.0|First off, I only like this movie for the special affects. The story line was horrible. The first version was far more interesting and much deeper. Yes, the special affects weren't nearly as good as the 2010 version's were, but the scenes where far deeper than the 2010'a. Point and case: the Medusa scenes. In the 1981 version, they arrive at the edge of the underworld and are preparing to enter the ruined temple in which Medusa lives. I thought it was an awesome suspense affect that you could hear her rattle but you didn't know where she was coming from, and you couldn't look or else you'd be turned to stone. Add to that, she looked demonic. That was the most intense scene to me. In the 2010 version, I just thought it was kind of cheesy that she was laughing and that the scene was more action than action and suspense. This is coming from a 21 year old. I wasn't even around when the 1981 version came about. But I love the effects of the 2010 version, but I like the older one much more. Just my two cents. :)

B003JTHESA|4.0|Same old adage... if you are looking for NOTB, POM, PS etc, then stop reading right now.  They haven't done anything like that since, well, those albums, they didn't do it here and probably never will again.    This album has the influences from the last three albums (BNW, DOD, AMOLAD) and dare I say, some subtle X factor/Virtual XI undercurrents.  So if you don't like the Blaze era, then you may not like Final Frontier.    However, if you have made it this far, you are probably intrigued as to what TFF has to offer.  'The Alchemist' is probably the one song you will relate to as the crunchy, in-your-face, rocking-out song.  Everything else is a progressive romp.  For those who rightly detest the overindulgence progressive metal bands tends to spew, fear not.  IM has have displayed progressive tendencies before (think SSOASS, SIT) and those are on display here, but these songs are crafted on typical IM time changes and have melody underlying the progressiveness.  Smith's guitar solos on 'Isle of Avalon' & 'Mother of Mercy' are the most interesting guitar work he's done since his return, if not through his entire tenure.      The songs are long, and where IM has been (rightfully) criticized for creating epic songs with endless repetition of some chorus, riff or stanza, that is not the case here.  The songs evolve and can hold your attention throughout... they are epic.  Perhaps those who grew up with the band will recognize that this album is exactly where Iron Maiden should be at this point in their career.  This album will not immediately knock your socks off; it will require your undivided attention.  If you give it, you will be rewarded with a melodically, progressive and well crafted 15th album from Iron Maiden.  If you were expecting anything else and you have made it this far into the review, sorry for wasting your time.  For everyone else, enjoy the journey.
B000NDI3SK|2.0|I heard so many marvelous things about this series I was surprised I didn't like it more.  I started at the parts on Newton and Einstein since physics and math were my 2 college degrees and was very disappointed.  I had just seen a marvelous 2 hour documentary on Einstein on TV and I looked into the life of Newton in a \\"History of Math\\" college class and elsewhere.  The \\"Ascent..\\" version was little more than a cursory overview of their lives, a few of their discoveries, and some scenes of the time and place.  No great philosophical musings or any real coherent over-arching theme.    For it's time, this was probably a breakthrough, but with all the specialized cable channels like Discovery, Science, and History churning out documentaries (probably looking to \\"Ascent...\\" as the grand daddy to be exceeded), there are much better things available now.  There are other series I could not say that about - \\"The World at War\\" from the same time period still stands head and shoulders above all competition in its subject matter.    The colors were faded, the video was grainy and dark, and the sound was scratchy.  This would not have mattered if the content was better.    Not without value, but not a \\"keeper\\".  Get it from your local library.

So why not go directly to the real experts of this subject and save yourself some money.

It has all the bells and whistles and a bag of chips (extra disc) you would expect. But what if you were stoked by the [[ASIN:B0027CSPS8 Lost: The Complete Fifth Season Dharma Initiative Orientation Kit [Blu-ray]]] and picked that up? I don't want to part with that-- it was a gem.  So now I have the whole series (except the final season), and if I want to have ALL the bells, now I have to buy it all AGAIN.<br /><br />At this price, a double-dip of this nature is not only painful, but embarassing.  Why not offer two editions: One only containing season 6 and all the doo-dads, then one with the complete series for those who didn't buy the others? It's possible. They can do it.  Now my wife and I are left with a choice: \\"Let it go\\" and leave our Lost display incomplete, or buy it and have a bunch of seasons to loan to friends?<br /><br />Either way, it seems to get the whole tamale, I have to buy the whole tamale, even though I have everything but the plate sitting in front of me already.<br /><br />As of this writing, my wife and I have three days to decide. I'm not going to talk about the show or any of the debate surrounding whether or not it was \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" or if it ended on a satisfying note-- I'll not be drawn into that.  I have 8 season box sets of \\"Charmed\\" which I need to find homes for since I picked up the [[ASIN:B001BN4WLI Charmed: The Complete Series - Limited Deluxe Edition]] edition (the one in the Book of Shadows), not to mention season boxed sets of Alias that were trumped by their [[ASIN:B000H5V8DG Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)]]...<br /><br />I'm simply asking as a consumer and a collector: Where is the line drawn?

0307277453|4.0|Though a wee bit technical for this armchair scientist, I was mostly able to follow this fascinating book on evolution. Most (non text)books on evolution either have a really broad scope (germs to fish to tetrapods and so on and so forth) or they focus on primate evolution leading to humans. Shubin, who has professional experience as an anatomy professor and a prehistoric fish specialist, writes something very different. Read this book, and you'll learn why fish embryos are commonly used in medical research, why it makes perfect sense for a fish-loving paleontologist to teach med students, and why that goofy looking \\"fishapod\\" on the cover is so important to understanding who we are.
0439023483|3.0|I'm a guy, and a reluctant reader. The third book of the series is coming out in a week, and the hype-machine is in full swing. So I decided to take a stab at book one. Back when this Hunger Games book came out, some thought it deserved award consideration. It doesn't. I give it a 3. You can read all the 4 and 5 star reviews for the plot points. I'm going to concentrate on why I deducted 2 points.    Warning...spoilers follow...    #1.  The main character of Katniss displays an inconsistency in her behavior and thoughts.  Overall I didn't find Katniss to be a very warm or likeable character. But many characters in literature are not totally likeable. However my bigger gripes are with Katniss's inconsistencies in thinking and actions. Unless your protagonist is suffering from a `multiple personality disorder', it's necessary that she display consistent thoughts and behavior throughout the entire book, i.e. her actions must align with her psyche. \\"Would Katniss really do this?\\" \\"Would Katniss really feel this?\\" \\"Would Katniss really say this?\\" There are many places throughout the story where Katniss expresses her repulsion of the games. She wants somehow to rebel against them. Then, only pages later, she seems to be enjoying herself. Her feelings mutate from \\"defiant begrudging participant\\" to \\"ecstatic career participant\\". The worst example of this is when she is presented with two outfits to wear. Maybe the author is making a statement on women's fashion in general. (What is it with women's clothes that completely muddles their minds?). Or maybe the author is trying to paint Katniss as flakey. Twilight's Bella Swan was flakey. I don't think flakey for Katniss was what this author intended.     Here's an example from the scene from the opening parade and the reaction due to Katniss's blazing outfit:    Someone throws me a red rose. I catch it and give it a delicate sniff, and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver. A hundred hands reach up to catch mykiss, as if it were a real and tangible thing.  \\"Katniss! Katniss!\\" I can hear my name being called from all sides. Everyone want's my kisses.    Or how about this one, when Katniss is being dressed for her \\"interview\\" to be broadcast on live TV across the whole nation:     \\"Can I open my eyes,\\" I ask.  \\"Yes,\\" says Cinna. \\"Open them.\\"  The creature standing before me in the full-length mirror has come from another world. Where skin shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make clothes from jewels. Because my dress, oh, my dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems, red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the flame design. The slightest movement gives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire.  I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun.  For a while we all just stare at me. \\"Oh, Cinna,\\" I finally whisper. \\"Thank you.\\"  \\"Twirl for me,\\" he says. I hold out my arms and spin in a circle. The prep team screams in admiration.    Does this sound like a defiant begrudging participant? The author and/or editor needed to catch this inconsistency. In fact during the whole book the author needed to hype-up the fact that Katniss is definitely \\"putting on a mask\\", \\"cynically playing to the crowd\\", and \\"hating every despicable minute of it\\". Unfortunately, this is not done, and at times, Katniss comes off as too compliant and wishy-washy...    #2.  During the last hundred pages, the book lost steam. It needed to be tightened. While the love interest was heightened, the narrative and dialog that dealt with it became maudlin, hackneyed, and eye-rolling. A lighter touch was necessary.    #3.  In the last battle, the appearance of the muttations felt totally out of context. It actually lessened the impact of the final confrontation with Cato. This wasn't a `Night of the Living Dead' zombie book.    #4.  The first Rule Change was fine...the second Rule Change (and then the third), seemed forced. Its only purpose was to shoehorn in a reprise of the star-crossed-lover scene out of Romeo and Juliet...and it came off as rushed, ham-fisted, and sappy.    Now I'm trying to decide if I'm even going to read the second installment. I've read some of the Amazon reviews of Catching Fire and it sounds like its a big step down from even this first one. It sounds like the author didn't expend much effort as the second book simply re-treads the plot of the first. It's \\"The Hunger Games Reloaded.\\" More love triangle stuff with an even wimpier Peeta. It also sounds like Katniss is even more fickle...one page it's she loves Peeta...next page it's Gale. She's having a Bella Swan attack...ugh.    Actually, Katniss never comes off in the first book as a \\"loving type\\", that is, other than for her little sister.  So even putting Katniss into a so-called love triangle seems to be a big stretch.    To sum it up, the failings of this book are main character driven. Like Bella Swan, Katniss doesn't seem to have any overall strong moral guiding fortitude or convictions...she wavers. A strong moral center was something that was required from the get go. \\"I'm repulsed by the games.\\" \\"I'll go along with them for now.\\" \\"But in the end--I'll get my revenge.\\" Unfortunately, this was 'not' how her character was depicted. So tell me...how is somebody this fickle ever going to lead a rebellion?

0307454541|2.0|Hype sells: it is obvious. The marketing for this book has included not only local bookstores going out of their way to push this book on respective readers, but setting up a campaign for three blockbuster movies for the trilogy. This seems to beg the question: If we are told something is good enough times, do we actually start to believe it? Apparently so.<br /><br />I guess I was like everyone else. I \\"had\\" to read this novel to see what all the fuss was. What I found wasn't unexpected, or anything out of the ordinary really: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the poster child for bestsellers that are sometimes mediocre, clich&eacute;, ho-hum, ordinary reads. I appreciate anyone who can write a novel with the best of them, and so it takes quite a bit for me to dislike a novel enough to give a negative review. The lowest review I've ever given has been The Da Vinci Code, which was 2 stars. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is pretty close to this in both its marketability and its style and publicity over substance, and there are times when the novel gets \\"all Da Vinci Code\\" on us (particularly toward the end). Still, I  thought it was slightly above this, which is slightly above mediocrity.<br /><br />So, what makes a bestseller these days? Sleaze, gratuitous violence a la Hostel style torture chamber, incest, dysfunctional family secrets, and lots and lots of coffee. If that isn't enough, then add a good deal of hacker, computer lingo or some nifty corporate clich&eacute; dialogue with some revenge thrown in.  If you aren't drinking vast amounts of coffee, sleeping casually with strangers (to give a \\"complex\\" angle to the story), hacking into others private information, exhibiting major revenge on someone who has in some way hurt you, or generally causing malicious harm to society (which may or may not include a torture dungeon that would have Hannibal Lecter licking his chops), then you probably aren't really with it, are you? Well, this is the world of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo to many degrees. It seems to boast about its above the edge shockability (the back cover describes as it as\\"sexy\\"), but this doesn't mean it's memorable, especially when you get through the flat, uninspired writing. I understand that it could be translation, but the prose was just very mediocre.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, despite all my banter, does have some intrigue and mystery and interest attached to its plot. I was interested when the mystery unfolded, and I did care when Mikael Blomkvist took the case, at the urging of Henrik Vangar, of Harriet's disappearance. The problem was that it took a good deal of computer and technical lingo just to arrive to this point. Then we meet our female protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, who is this goth-alternative-hacker-antisocial type who helps Blomkvist along with the case. We are given some back story about her, and feel a certain amount of pity for her. She seems to have had a rough life, and we feel a genuine interest in her. Together they work on the case of Harriet's disappearance. We will learn that the story takes off into another direction though.<br /><br /> However, while the story contains some amount of fascination, it is absorbed in protagonists who aren't really worthy of being protagonists,  a \\"twist\\" towards the conclusion that is aggravating on the nerves, and  a plot that finally spirals out control into some ludicrous ending that would satisfy Hollywood. Both \\"protagonists\\", while not as dirty as most characters, are hardly worthy to root for in this book, proving ultimately that looking out for oneself is the most important thing, as they essentially serve their own needs whatever way possible. Mikael sleeps around more than Austin Powers, and Lizbeth, for all problems in life, is just a stage below psychotic herself. The cute little \\"twist\\" that the author throws at us seems to be more publicity stunt than anything else; personally, I thought it wasa cheesy ploy, and rendered much of the book \\"meaningless.\\". Not only that, but when we finally understand the antagonist's motives, it comes to us via Scooby Doo reasoning and plotting. Finally, the last part of the book (about the last one hundred pages) was the most unnerving, ingratiating, ludicrous, ill-logical, far-fetched tripe I've read. I literally wanted to throw the book against the wall. I couldn't decide whether to shout out protests, slam the book down in disgust, or just laugh at the lameness. It just seemed like everything fit so nicely into a little, convenient box. To me, this is where the book went really downhill, and pretty much solidified its place with the likes of overrated books such as The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />By the end of the six hundred and whatever pages, I was tired of the main characters and just wanted it done with. Does The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo have some intrigue? Sure, it does. But, many weaknesses in this book don't make up for that. It is just another \\"bestseller\\" type that is overrated, and builds itself on word of mouth, publicity, hype, Hollywood blockbuster films, and is designed to make the masses go gaga over it. It's not horrible--but very average--pretty much as good as anything you might randomly pick up in the mystery or fiction section at your local bookstore.<br /><br />On a side note, I found out that that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo actually translates in Sweden as \\"A refill of coffee, please.\\" Honest. I researched it.<br /><br />2 ½ starse book \\"meaningless.\\". Not only that, but when we finally understand the antagonist's motives, it comes to us via Scooby Doo reasoning and plotting.

B001FB55L2|4.0|This movie shows a young married couple with two small children. The husband is a marine with a high rank. They are a happy closeknit family. His father and stepmom are part of their life. The husband is played by Tobey, and he has a brother who he seems to be protective of, played by Jake. Jake's role is more of the scapegoat, being measured as less than by his father. It starts off just showing the way the family acts with each other than it branches off into Tobey's character going to war to Afghanastan. He and another officier get shot down and become prisoners of war. The torture scenes feel brutal and what is required brings Tobey's character waves of shame. He gets saved by a fleet of marines than has to go home and find that his life will never be the same again. His brother ends up filling his shoes while he was away. The title makes it seem like it was about the two and their connection together, yet I don't really see a plot line that warrants that title. The disasterous damage done to the psyche is reflected well by the actor, Maguire. You can see the set tension in his face and body language. The wife, Natalie, loves her husband and wants to support as best she can. She does a good job at showing her feelings on screen and is so believable. I liked to see Portman who has been a favorite actor since Garden State. I liked the caring and thoughtfulness that the brothers father showed to Portman's character and children by buying milk and just being so at ease with his extended role to them. The way the tears fell from her cheeks with such ease and clear feeling. The ice skating. The understanding and acceptance towards the change of someone whose loved. A new beginning.

B002KREVCO|4.0|As a big fan of AC/DC for many years I was happy to get my Backtracks copy finally.  The first CD studio rarities is a great collection of B-Side/US undreleased songs, but to the hard core fan they all have been heard through bootleg.  It's a shame the first single (\\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl\\") with Dave Evans was not released with this set.  Nice though these songs have been released properly and I assume remastered.    The 2nd disc is filled with some good sounding Live Stuff.  Always good to hear Soundboard recorded live AC/DC.      The 3rd disc (Family Jewels 3) is very good as well picking up where the first 2 CD's left off.    Nothing really earth shattering here, but still fun to listen too for the AC/DC collector.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|So I'm really glad that I decided to watch this show recorded instead of on TV. When the first season ended, I almost threw something at the TV until I realized that I had the 2nd season ready to go so I could immediately put it in and continue watching.<br /><br />Another reason that I'm glad to be watching this show recorded as opposed to TV is because there are a lot of little things to pick up on between the flashbacks and the present time. The characters continue to have a lot of depth and the interaction is wonderful. I have to say that my favorite character is John Locke who is a definite enigma.<br /><br />This is a great show, if you haven't seen it, it's well worthwhile. If you have, you might be able to pick up on some nuances that you missed with the seasons stretched out over 6 years. Either way, this show is a classic.

B00005NKCM|5.0|I'm sort of glad I started with the fifth season, because while I still enjoy the characters in their first season form, I have a greater appreciation for their incredible development as people over the course of the series.  Having seen the beloved cook Mrs. Bridges in her final form in Season Five, it was positively shocking to see her sell some of the household's food for her own personal gain.  I know that it was done at the time--it may well have been expected and accepted by employers--but I could hardly have imagined her doing so!  Had I watched the series from beginning to end as most people do, I would have missed this sense of personal growth and integrity, because I would already have forgotten the passing event by the end of the series.  That would have been sad.<br /><br />In Season One, the viewer is introduced to all the main characters.  Their edges are \\"raw\\" here, because they have yet to undergo the smoothing and sorting process that occurs among members of the same household.  The era is the very early 1900's and the costumes, manners and technology produce a sense of ambiance that is almost like being there.  The social inequities of the period are the central focus of this season, probably because it is the aspect of early twentieth century England most likely to come to mind to writers wanting to create a \\"real\\" experience for viewers.  Certainly to anyone steeped in Dickens as most of the contributers probably were, this would be the easiest theme to begin with for a new program.  This would also have been a good point to pick during the turbulant 1970s, when everything about society was (again) being questioned by the young of the time.<br /><br />Most of the season deals with the realities of being a poor person dependent upon a wealthy household for his or her well being.  The steep fall from the safety of a domestic position to destitution is made very clear.  The sacrifice of personal dignity or even physical integrity in order to avoid the crushing poverty of urban England is made abundantly clear by the events in the life of the house maid Sarah, the scullery maid Emily, and the footman Albert.  Much of the action seems to be seen from the perspective of the upper parlor maid, Rose, who throughout the seasons takes a very leading role in events both upstairs and downstairs. By using her as their foil, the writers manage to make the realities of the more unfortunate characters much more realistic.  Rose sees the rise and fall of many individuals in the household and clings tenaciously to the safety of her role in the house.  She is also witness to the frustrations of those above stairs, especially the younger members of the household who have a foot in both the old world of their elders and the new one that is being technologically forced on them.<br /><br />Above stairs, the social mores of the upper class reveal the extent to which they are also hamstrung by expectations and demands.  James Belamy is unable to find satisfaction in his role as heir.  The acceptable careers open to him are limited and framed by expectations.  Elizabeth, his sister, having acheived a level of education and social awareness that is not generally allowed in upper class women, struggles unsuccessfully with the social ills of her time, only to find she is not taken seriously and that she is completely unprepared for the realities of the poor or to make any effective changes in their condition.  She can only give them food and clothing, a bandaid on a situation that obviously requires major surgery!  Lady Marjorie--and indirectly her mother--a woman who has the mind and abilities of a man but who must work politically through her husband leads a pampered but rather boring life, waiting to host influential parties for her husband.  Her husband Richard, is a man of common origins made 1st viscount Bellamy.  His upbringing as a middle class person--son of a minister--puts his values and his actions often at odds, creating amarvelous dramatic dissonance.  His decisions, while noble, are not always realistic or wise given the situations in which he finds himself, making him the very illustration of a man whose good intentions lead so often to disaster or at least unpleasantness.  Married to an aristocrat whose money finances his political career and lifestyle, he is often unable to do what his conscience dictates but must dance to the tune played by his in-laws.<br /><br />What stands out most, especially after viewing the final season, is how the sometimes tragic events of the lives of these people brings them closer and closer together.  Their consideration of and feelings for one another over the course of the 5 seasons is heartwarming.  Even while we realize that the social ills of the time in which the characters lived were unpleasant, we can't help but feel it is from this type of caring that individuals survived and improved their world, and it gives us hope for our own.<br /><br />A wonderful period piece, and marvelous drama.ssonance.

B003N5VOUO|5.0|This movie was moving, and had excellent cinematography and acting.  The prevalent messages of perserverance, love, believing in the good in people regardless of their race and religion, and reaching out and helping others really touched me.  I genuinely was moved to tears in some parts of the movie, and overwhelmed with joy and compassion in other parts.  This is one of the best movies that I have seen in long time.  It is definitely a remarkable movie with a memorable message.

But if you are looking for cars coming up from the rear the image is plenty big enough.  I mounted all 3 mirrors on bike handlebars.  I still have a large helmet mounted mirror that also use, but I let other folks ride my bikes and they don't have helmet mounted mirrors.  I find myself looking at this Zefal mirror most of the time.  Installs in seconds.  Highly recommend it.

This book may very well save me from the same faith. The case made by T. Colin Campbell is so thorough and comprehensive it can't be denied. Some of the negative reviews here made me laugh out loud. No scientific evidence presented in the book? REALLY!? Did we read the same book? Clearly most if not all of the negative reviews here are biased and have no scientific merit. Read the book and you will see how wrong and ignorant the negative reviews are.

0307454541|4.0|This takes place in Sweden. Harriet Vanger, a 16 year old girl, disappeared in 1966 without a trace.  For over 30 years her father tries to find her with no luck.  As a last chance he hires Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist, to investigate.  He's helped by a young antisocial tattooed girl named Lisbeth Salander.  They slowly uncover what happened...and someone is out to stop them.<br /><br />Long (over 600 pages) but easy to read and never boring.  It pulls you in and manages to juggle numerous different characters without confusing the reader.  It also gets VERY sick and disturbing at the end but you can't stop reading.  I definetely want to read the other books.<br /><br />One big problem--the main mystery is solved with OVER 100 pages to go!  Then they throw in some more uninteresting complications which weigh the book down.  So it is very good but it could have been excellent if they tightened up the last 100 pages or so.
193413712X|2.0|A very woffly effort with confusing structure, patchy characters, long boring and uninteresting passages. Fragments of memories someone has of someone else's memories about someone they had never met. Making very little sense. Can't imagine why this book got a Pulizer.
0316010669|3.0|I really did enjoy this book, but it didn't change my life or make me desperately want to read anything else by this author.     The negatives: The start of the novel is a touch disjointed and jumps around a bit. Lacks focus at the beginning. (The book's flow is just fine at the end though). It still jumps around though. This book is racially charged and clearly written by an African American. This isn't a bad thing, but all the racist accusations are pointed toward white against black. Nothing of Islam or Middle Eastern prejudice or others. He does touch a bit of blacks being prejudiced against blacks which is interesting, but I would just love to have heard more expanded research into some concepts.    Positives: If you're a fan of the TV show, Lie to Me, you'll at the very least like this book. Interesting read. Has some great incites. I'm tired of writing this review now.....
B000SMWUPS|2.0|Thought this would be great after seeing on at the zoo, but is gets crumpled up and in the way when folding the stroller...    Update JAn 2011.  It is still sitting in the garage unused.  It looked great on other strollers, but not so great on the Quest.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith Urban is an incredibly talented artist who just gets better and better! I bought this cd as soon as it was released and I haven't stopped playing it since then.  There isn't one song on it that I skip past.  I love his sound, energy, and style.  I'm already looking forward to his next release.
0698116496|2.0|I LOVE this book, but this is not the great toddler friendly board book.  it is paperback.  Find the board book and you've got a 5 star review!  Our kids love to read this at night.  This is a must for new parents and baby showers!
0307266303|5.0|This, was one amazing read.  You know the kind, the type of book that you read into the wee hours of the night until you just can't do it any longer. You replace the bookmark, close the cover and say to yourself \\"can't wait to get back to this tomorrow,\\" and reluctantly shuffle off to bed.    For anyone who is even considering going barefoot or minimalist, this book is a must read.  The author makes the question of whether one should run unshodden a slam dunk.  This book is fillled with data that makes one quit doubting his decision to take up the endeaver that is running.      Reading this made me think about a lecture I had my sophomore year in college.  I had this anthropology course taught by a very well respected professor for his research and publications regarding the evolution of humans.  This guy was a runner to nth degree.  You must know that I was a sophomore in college in 1968.  My anthropolgy professor was an avid runner when running was not cool, it was just wierd.  Running then was lunatic fringe stuff.  This man spent one entire lecture telling us how mankind has evolved to become a long distance running machine.  Way back when homo erectus branched away from neanderthal man, he needed to slap down a steak on the table to feed wife and kids.  How did he do this?  He chased his game to the point of exhaustion.  He could do this because unlike his quarry, running man did not need to stop off and pee, poop, drink or rest.  Our caveman was slower, but man could he keep going.  It's a tortoise vs. hare thing.  In the end, the tortoise wins because he can go the distance.     Buy this book and you will not regret it.  I owe my level of fitness to two people, my college professor who instilled in me the desire to run, and the aurhor of this book who convinced me to do it unshodden.   I thank you both.      Do what your body tells you    dave
B003183UCI|5.0|I bought this toy for a friend who I introduced to Dr. Who and is now obsessed.  She absolutely flipped out when she opened the bag and saw this toy!  Shes had it for over a month now and as far as I can tell it is still in perfect working order.  I did notice that the ink nibs that fit into the hilt of the toy do not fit as tightly as I would like them to, but they arent loose enough to prevent using the pen feature if you are careful.  The UV ink is a novel idea but what really stood out about this particular toy was the fact that the head extends just like it does on the show, and the cheaper versions of this toy that amazon has available do not have this cool feature.  The best thing about this toy is the first reaction of the reciever!  Get ready for screams of joy and hours of role playing as everybodies favorite time traveller.

1416589473|4.0|Two and a half centuries ago, the bestial charr invaded Ascalon.  Desperate King Adelbern, knowing his monarchy was about to be overrun by the evil charr, called forth the magical Foefire to burn the malevolent assailants.  He succeeded in killing the enemy, but the magic did not differentiate between friend and foe so many humans died too.  Upset and perhaps insane with grief, the dead Ascalonians became spirit protectors of the burnt remains of a destroyed kingdom.  The few survivors left for neighboring Kryta.<br /><br />In the present Queen Jennah hopes to sign a peace treaty with the charr abominations, as a war would devastate the humans.  However, before negotiating the charr demand the return of the Claw of the Khan-Ur, perhaps the holiest of artifacts that they lost in the Foefire of Ascalon.  The monarch orders adventurer Dougal Keane to lead a team of misfits into the ruins of Ascalon, a place he considers worse than hell.  Not only is he unsure what awaits him in the shadows though he has heard of the legend of the Ghosts of Ascalon, but is positive many charr and humans prefer war for various motives and will kill a band seeking a peace trophy.<br /><br />This is an entertaining quest fantasy with an obvious tie to the game.  The story line is fast-paced with exciting action-packed combat scenes and a strong cast especially Dougal and his comrades.  Although the plot ebbs (in between the hostilities) and flows (vivid battle scenes), fans of the GuildWars video game will want to join Dougal and his team that he despises as they venture on a journey with little hope of retuning.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000GGOCIE|5.0|I LOVED this book.  {I hated the TV movie.}  I found the book facinating, earthy, and thoroughly absorbing.  Historically authentic and culturally intricate, it's a tale of substance and depth. While it's about women, for women, I think men who read it will enjoy it too. *HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  Skip the made-for-tv film version.  It's awful, very much changed from the book. The BOOK is Far More Satisfying.  P.S.- Another book I'd recommend is 'The Glory & the Lightning&#34; by Taylor Caldwell.
0143118420|3.0|2.75 stars<br /><br />I was really excited to finally have the free time to devote to finishing this book, and I can't express how much of a let down it was!  I'm not normally a skeptical reader, but I kept wondering throughout the entire story if certain \\"true\\" parts of the story were embellished or even completely made up.  Parts of Gilbert's story were definitely interesting and entertaining, and other parts were equally selfish, self-righteous and boring. Maybe it was all the hype surrounding this book that ultimately left a sour note with me. Maybe I just couldn't believe in Gilbert's journey.  This story definitely isn't for everyone, but the only way to really know if you'll enjoy it is to read it for yourself.
0316067938|1.0|i read the book and instantly was crazy about it. i could not put the book down till i started breaking dawn. when i read it i seriously thought some one was playing a prank on me. i felt like Stephanie Meyer completely destroyed the every character, the whole story line. i couldn't even recognize the characters. and top of that she ruined Jacobs character. why she had to do that i do not understand. if you are just starting the book read the first but do not read the breaking dawn. it will completely destroy the 3 books before the breaking dawn.

0385737947|3.0|I know James Dashner. I mostly enjoyed his first, Jimmy Fincher series. The premise seemed interesting.   The good: The story setting is compelling, and the action moves right along.  The bad: The major plot device is people not knowing what is going on. You have to be able to swallow some extremely specific memory modification and the creation of a huge complex environment for some really important reason. This plus all the other specifically designed but head scratching elements require one heck of a big reveal. Then we get to the end of the story and are faced not only with not much of a reveal, but yet more mystery and unanswered questions.     Being beaten over the head with what you don't know gets old after a while, especially when you really never are given a good answer for 90% of it. As a middle grade book, you can get away with some hand-waving in place of real thought, but not too much. And since this is a middle grade book, it sure seems to have a whole lot of killing in it, as well as the substitute swear words that are used just as the more common ones would be, but no explanation is given for them except that I'm sure that it helps keep the 'rating' of the book down.     The book is a fast read, fairly well written and fast paced enough not to get boring, but reveals are not matched with the mysteries.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This movie is great, one of my all time favorites. But I'm not going to tell you anything you haven't heard somewhere else............but you may finally learn what a stomach pounder and a coke is. I couldn't find the answer to this online ( or at least one that made sense ) so I asked John Carpenter tonight at Monster Mania in New Jersey. He told me that a stomach pounder is something that they did in the eighties when working out, you would do a sit up and when you were on your back someone would slap you in the gut multiple times then you do another sit up, I remembered I saw this in one of the Rocky movies. So I asked John if thats what the kid was requesting and he told me no, he just thought it was a cool name for some kind of sandwich. I hope this helps anyone else who was wondering what the hell this kid was asking for.
B000001F3C|5.0|What can be said about War that hasn't been said?  Nothing, really.  This is by far U2's finest work, the single greatest CD of the entire 1980s, and one of the great rock CDs of all time.  You can feel the urgency, the near desperation, and the incredible energy that power this amazing CD.  When War first came out, I listened to it continuously for three years--for real.  Nearly 30 years later, I still listen to it often.  If I had to pick a single favorite song on this magnificent CD, it would probably be \\"Surrender.\\"    For fun, I decided to rank U2's first 11 studio CDs from most to leave favorite, and here's what I came up with:    1) War  2) Joshua Tree  3) Pop  4) October  5) Boy  6) Zooropa  7) How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb  8) Rattle and Hum  9) Achtung Baby  10) Unforgettable Fire  11) All That You Can't Leave Behind (but I wish I did)    War is the single greatest CD of the entire 1980s. Everyone likes The Joshua Tree, and I concur (although, shoot me for saying this, I think the weakest track is \\"With Or Without You\\"). I would rate the oft-maligned Pop third (it's probably their final \\"great\\" record), I give a slight edge to October over the more uneven Boy, and then put Zooropa 6th (although if I ranked these based on how often I listen to the CDs, Zooropa would definitely rank higher, and it contains an absolutely magnificent song, \\"Dirty Day\\"). Jumping to the bottom, All That You Can't Leave Behind is simply awful (I didn't think U2 could ever do \\"trite\\" but ATYCLB proves otherwise), and the noble failure that's called The Unforgettable Fire is just above the very bottom (five first-rate songs, two of which are badly done and vastly improved in their re-worked live versions, and the rest of it unlistenable).  I know for many fans, \\"Achtung Baby\\" is a favorite U2 CD, but you know, that one has never worked for me.  It seems like a random disconnected group of songs, some very good, more than a few not, with far too much filler (c'mon, does anyone really like \\"So Cruel\\", perhaps the most painfully long 5:49 that U2 ever recorded?) with very few crossings over into the \\"great\\" category--think \\"Mysterious Ways\\" and \\"Zoo Station.\\"  To my ears, not only is Zooropa far better, but it's also an unfairly criticized first-rate effort.    And one last list:  my half-dozen favorite U2 songs:  (in no particular order)  1)  Surrender - War  2)  I Will Follow - Boy  3)  Dirty Day - Zooropa  4)  One Tree Hill - Joshua Tree  5)  Gloria - October  6)  Pride - Unforgettable Fire    With the bottom half of the great dozen (i.e. runners-up, in no particular order):  7)  Stories For Boys - Boy  8)  Two Hearts Beat As One - War  9)  Red Hill Mining Town - Joshua Tree  10)  City of Blinding Lights - How To Dismantle...  11)  Stranger In A Strange Land - October  12)  Mysterious Ways - Achtung Baby
0316067938|1.0|I absolutely loved the Twilight saga books... until BD. Bella and Edward had one of the greatest romances in literature... until the bitter end. Then it was utterly ruined. All the romance, excitement, wonder, and sacrifice of the three first books was destroyed in BD. I wish I could have selective amnesia... I just don't get the reason for the absurdly happy ending, and the strange relationship between Jacob, Bella, and Renesmee which frankly turns my stomach (maybe that's how they do it in Utah). Anyway, since the sweet release of amnesia is not coming, I think I'll just pretend that BD never happened and substitue my own, more satisying ending, where Jacob kidnaps Bella to save her human life, and he and Edward battle to the near death for her love... Edward winning of course... and Jacob sadly licking his wounds until finally meeting his imprintable true-love months later at a pow-wow of NW Native American tribes! In this ending, everyone is satisfied, including the readers who've invested so much time, emotion, and money in this series. I cannot express my profound confusion, horror, and disappointment in the ending to this once magnificent series... Was the editor asleep when she turned in the manuscript? The only word to describe my feelings is... betrayal. I know it's strong, but it is unfortunately accurate. The only hope for any kind of redemption is if Melissa Rosenberg can somehow correct these fantastic errors in the movie script... or somehow make them more palatable... That's a lot on her plate, and I may just have to boycott the final movie rather than witness this sad, freakish conclusion come to life and choke on it.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I have never understood why \\"Pop\\" receives so much derision in so many quarters.  I've been a U2 fan since \\"October\\", and I think this is one of the highlights of their career.  This is not an uplifting CD as some of U2's CDs can be, but it's no less wonderful.  \\"Pop\\" is first-rate U2, and any fan of theirs who does not give it a fair listen is missing out in a big way.    For fun, I decided to rank U2's first 11 studio CDs from most to leave favorite, and here's what I came up with:    1) War  2) Joshua Tree  3) Pop  4) October  5) Boy  6) Zooropa  7) How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb  8) Rattle and Hum  9) Achtung Baby  10) Unforgettable Fire  11) All That You Can't Leave Behind (but I wish I did)    War is probably the single greatest CD of the entire 1980s.

B000001EHS|3.0|Do these guys know what the word \\"hit\\" means? There's two songs on here from their later days that never were hits and one song that's entirely new. 'Scuse me? New music doesn't belong on a \\"greatest hits\\" CD. Conspicuous by their absence are such classics as \\"Too Late for Love\\" and \\"Gods of War.\\" Another reviewer was correct when (s)he said to just buy \\"High n Dry\\" ....\\"Pyromania\\" and \\"Hysteria.\\" Then again, maybe that's what they want you to do.

B002ZG9846|5.0|Didn't know if I would like this movie. I rented it , and right after watching I had to go on Amazon and order the Blu Ray !! Aaron Johnson does a great job playing Kick-Ass , the eponymous hero of the movie. Chloe Grace Moretz kills it as Hit Girl ! This movie is pretty violent but really awesome. Does a great job of balancing humor , emotion , and great action. Even Nic Cage did a great job as Big Daddy , and McLovin was not his usual annoying self , he was pretty good as Red Mist. A great movie about what would really happen if someone put on a costume and tried to fight crime , in real life.
B002RKSULM|5.0|I enjoy Jane Austen as an author and I have always favored Pride and Prejudice. The digital version on Kindle has a lot of capitalized words that were not written that way and, with today's technology, it does appear to be shouting. Some of the words are missing half of the letters and one can only guess at what the word should be. The overall story remains one of my favorites.
0596806027|4.0|This book is about HTML5, so it is not an introduction to HTML. If you are not familiar with HTML at all, it is better to pick up other books, and then come back to this book to learn about HTML5. If you are an experienced web developer who knows HTML then this is your book to learn about the features of HTML5. The book is written in an easy to follow language, examples are practical, and through the examples you can see the difference between HTML5 and the previous versions of the mark up language. Recommended for experienced web developers.
0596806027|5.0|[This is a review for the eBook, available now at ORA's website]<br /><br />If you want to get out of the slipshod world of text/html and Flash, and into the unforgiving world of HTML5 which is \\"strict\\"- _HTML5 Up & Running_ is the book to start you on your way. And Mark Pilgrim, well known in web geek circles is the guy to write it. The book methodically starts with the history of HTML5, and then segues into testing for support as well as fallback measures for those who need to add HTML5 to their sites.<br /><br />If you're versed in Javascript, CSS and HTML, you should have little problems understanding the code examples and using them in your sites. So I really recommend picking up the eBook either in ePub or PDF form --ORA provides both DRM free, code use is also royalty free, unless noted.<br /><br />If you're puzzled about how video, geolocation, or local storage is handled in HTML5, you shouldn't be for long.<br /><br />Some nice touches in the eBook: hot links everywhere, repeated at the end of every chapter for further reading. For those who will just stick with the print version, [...]/ links that are easily typed. But seriously: I strongly recommend that you pick the eBook if you're 'just going for paper.'<br /><br />This book, along with a few others are never leaving my iBooks.app shelf. If you want to know the depth & ramifications of using HTML5, this book should be on your shelf as well. Highly recommended.

B003O85W3A|5.0|I have been listening to this new Arcade Fire release for about three weeks. It is playing in my office, in the car, in the house. I've played it so often because I have been trying to determine why, after the initial listen, I declared this work, \\"brilliant.\\"    I never judge music after one listen. Like wine, the third sip tells you if the drink is good. The first two help you tongue acclimate to the flavors. By the third listen, I can make a fairer assessment. The Suburbs is different. Each listen endorses my initial reaction. Somewhere around listen ten, I thought maybe the disc had a soft middle. I spend the next few plays trying to affirm that reaction, but I couldn't. There are no weak links. This is a strong, strong compilation of a mature musical team at their prime.    In the New York Times last week, an editorial indicated that many fans are calling the band, \\"sell-outs\\" because of this CD. Apparently, there is a ceiling of sales to qualify a group of musicians as \\"hip.\\" What these folks fail to realize is that the masses are constantly growing. Creative people are always out front, blazing new trails. When the masses meet the creative, this is a good thing. The level of appreciation has been raised. The listener is better for the experience and the artists can begin again with a new path, in a new direction.    Regardless whether you feel this is the first step on Arcade Fire's road to perdition or the logical next chapter after Neon Bible, this is damn fine music from a group simply at the top of their game. Don't hate them because they are good, revel in the fact that we have great musicians making remarkable music. This does not happen that often.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Javier Bardem is a very attractive man. Not beautiful in the Hollywood sense, but oozing masculinity and sensuality.  In this Woody Allen film he gets rewarded by getting all the girls and some pretty attractive ones too like Penelope Cruz, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall who join him in twosomes and threesomes in beautiful Spain (Barcelona).  The chemistry in-between the actors is perfect not like in \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" which I just saw and where Javier oozes too but there is no chemistry with Julia Robert at all and while the love affairs in Vicky Christina Barcelona seemed believable, the love affair in Eat, pray, love did not.     But the movie is not only about rolling around in bed, there is wonderful music, great actors, beautiful locations and an amusing story.    All in all a very funny, entertaining and sexy film

B001NFNFNA|4.0|Angelina Jolie is excellent in the role of a telephone supervisor, whose young son is abducted while she is at work.  Ultimately she is informed that her son has been found alive, but when she goes to the railroad station to greet her returning son, she claims that the boy is not her son.  She is criticized and reprimanded by a corrupt police lieutenant, who decides to commit her to an insane asylum.  Meanwhile a pastor has been helping her discover the truth, which finally shows her son actually died heroically trying to save another boy from a madman who was brutally murdering young boys.  There are two trial scenes; one where the murderer is brought to justice and one where the police lieutenant is demoted and the equally corrupt police chief loses his job as well.  Based on a true story, this film is well done, and I recommend it as a must-see motion picture.

0802714544|5.0|My first Le Carre book almost turned me off Le Carre: The Russia House, a turgid, lumbering tome written by a man who was far too busy being a Great Writer to be bothered with something so trivial as writing a good spy story.  Fortunately, I found The Spy Who Came In From the Cold at a yard sale and decided to try again.    This is Le Carre before he decided he was a Great Writer and just wanted to tell a story about what spying was really like; the numbing, insidious corruption that seeps into the souls of men who are professional liars, who must live lies every second of their lives, who dare not trust either their superiors or their subordinates.  Alec Leamas may be the most unpleasant, misanthropic protagonist in fiction, and yet Le Carre manages to make us sympathize with him anyway, because his misanthropy is so thoroughly justified by the life he has led.  That he is still capable of any love at all after what he has gone through, even the limited love he shows in the book, appears as a triumph of the human spirit.    The plot is intricate, unpredictable, and yet believable.  One point, though, remains unresolved at the end.  The true explanation for Mundt's actions at the beginning must lie elsewhere from what he have been led to believe.  Those who have read Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (or who, like me, saw the BBC version) may have a good lead to the truth.    There is an unfortunate point; Le Carre hints here at the irrational anti-Americanism he has since more fully expressed in print, a sentiment disguised as a critique (sometimes warranted) of American policy, but which clearly has far deeper roots in offended British nationalism.  Happily, there is much more to Le Carre than this; sadly, there may not be much more to the critical reputation he enjoys.

B0000071GA|5.0|Krokus was a metal band from Switzerland that made an indelible mark in the world of metal rock of the early 80's. Their signature song, SCREAMING IN THE NIGHT rivaled any other metal band's best material of that era. The title track is stellar, too. These guys hung around for a while to make some great metal songs--songs that are still relevant today. Forget the AC/DC comparisons.....they had their own identity, and this album delivers in power and style. This album deserves a place among the best metal albums of the 80's. 9/10

B000816TCY|5.0|For years I put off the purchase of a second battery for my Nikon digital camera.  But when we planned our 2010 vacation to several of our beautiful National Parks, something told me I should have a spare battery.  I ordered it, charged it up, and it was ready to jump in when needed.  Sure enough, right before Old Faithful began to spit at Yellowstone, my original battery ran out of juice.  Family members panicked.  But it was a breeze to switch out the expired battery for the charged one, and  my camera was ready when the famous geyser exploded.   That night I charged up the 1st battery, and before the vacation was over I needed to switch batteries again.  Don't deny yourself a spare!  It's worth it.  And if your camera requires the Nikon EN-EL8, remember, it's small and easy to carry in a pocket of your camera case.  You will never have to stress out over whether or not to take a picture, \\"because your battery might be almost gone, and a better photo op may come along.\\"  Carry the spare, and you're ready for a stress free vacation.  Snap away!

I struggled to read one forth of it and had to give up (have is archived on my Kindle for future if I want to continue being bored later). It's a litany of names, who they're sleeping with sprinkled with a bit of continued clerical debauchery, crookedness and passed off in a ho hum story...well, sort of story. The Pillars of the Earth is a far better book: It moves, it's exciting, it's got more of a story line that can be followed. And it has the Follett voyeuristic sex that he seems to be fascinated with. I suppose it's like any successful book or film: The first goes well, so author/film maker decides to try it again with a sequel that usally falls flat as this book does. No need to rehash the story (there really isn't one unless you consider a soap opera worthy). Suggestion: Don't waste your time or $$$ on this bomb.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to this series. Very action packed, suspenseful, and hilarious.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|I liked the movie \\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" which is a humorous and violent retelling of World War II history. The film branches off into several interconnected storylines, all of which are fantastic and interesting. The cast is fantastic and the story itself is a good one, but I thought the movie was a bit too long and was very anticlimactic at the end. I'm glad I didn't see this in the theatres because I would have been disappointed, but it's worth checking out on cable or DVD.

B003INJETO|5.0|Daniel Gildenlow's voice is an unparalleled mixture of passion, vulnerability, & pain that reaches into the soul, past the weathered armor of even the most hardened 'road warrior'. When I listen to 'Road Salt', it takes me into lost parts of my own soul that I forgot existed, past the barricades & defenses we create to protect ourselves along the way; his visceral vocalizations are an impassioned illustration of the Hero's Journey we ALL must make. The first time I heard it, I just wept; it was such a release. I felt, at a deep spiritual level: 'I'm not alone in this journey; it's as if his soul reached right through the recording into mine; indeed, into all who would open up their hearts/minds/souls and listen!     The songs on Road Salt are emotionally evocative, as well as musically edgy, atmospheric, and always interesting, and impeccably played by musicians who are all virtuosos in their own right!  This CD is a RARE GEM; I have heard nothing in rock or popular music that comes close in the last 20 years!!!
B003PR77II|5.0|Some people say that the Nightmare album sounds like Metallica, it didn't sound like Metallica (save for Nightmare) to me...it sounded melancholic...it was sad...I had an ear bud in while I was finishing some chores and I was listening to the whole thing, it nearly made me burst into to tears...it was horribly sad. Usually A7X has the attitude of, \\"We're going to kill them violently.\\" The album just sounded like, \\"We're going to die violently.\\" In short...it made me very sad. It is an excellent album...but it was very, very sad. And truthfully...I think they meant it to be that way. The whole thing was a story. I realize that...it's a story of never waking up from a nightmare...and finally dying in that nightmare...it's very poetic. Jimmy died in his sleep...his heart gave out. They also got one of Jimmy's drumming idols to step in for him...which is also poetic. Just thinking about it nearly makes me choke up.<br /><br />The boys did wonderful...it's a beautiful album...their best yet...despite everything. Keep going guys, Jimmy would proud.<br /><br />RIP Jimmy...we miss you.

0061714372|4.0|As a long time Megadeth fan, I found this book very interesting. Of course, a lot of these stories I've heard before but never in this much detail. Dave seems to be happy with his accomplishments and not as bitter. I would have liked to learn more about the songwriting, and recording, process. Those parts were over too quick for me. Another thing is that when Dave recounts a lot of stories, things seem very conveniently skewed in his direction. The other guy looks bad or gets the blame. I have no way to know if they're true, but it was suspicious.
0732267633|5.0|My quirky Swedish friend recommended the book, an act of faith she rare has done--so of course, I went and got a copy. What a delight. At first, what seemed to be a depressing tale of what might have been evolves into a fable of what can be--if one only follows their own path. Life isn't in one size and no, not everyone will be a doctor or lawyer or fabulously well off, or merely very comfortable. Any one who has felt like the black sheep, or been told they are one--will GET this tale in a gulp. Beautifully written in such simple, but exacting language that you might forget--how philosophical the book really is.
1439181780|5.0|Received my book in just 48 hrs, free shipping and half the price! Though I would have paid over 50 bucks for it anyhow! Rhonda Byrne has done it again. I am a young woman on the journey to self discovery and her books have helped tremendously! I am forever grateful. :) I would recommend this book to anyone.

I bought it to take on my summer trip to the Mediterranean and I was absolutely riveted.<br /><br />The first installment was a little too brutal for my taste, but this one had just the right amount of intrigue, murder and action.  I just ordered book three and can't wait to get started on it.
B000FBFN0Q|1.0|I got \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" for my Kindle for only $.89, and feel it was worth the price. After reading it, I have to say I'm really glad I didn't spend more.<br /><br />The book started off being a cute and fun read, but the main character's complete disregard for accepting any responsibility for her actions, and her apparent inability to rehabilitate herself ultimately made me just have nothing but disdain for her. Before the book was over, I was downright disliking this stupid, foolish, dishonest, irresponsible girl.<br /><br />If there had just been some hint of her finally \\"seeing the light\\" it would have been so much more tolerable.
B000002UTO|5.0|[[ASIN:B00000DQSV Notorious]] wound up being a very successful comeback album for Duran Duran and while they remained a trio they were still willing to keep adapting their music even further with each new release. Superficially this album possess a similar groove based funk structure as the previous one but all the same many new elements along the way. The album begins with five uptempo songs in the title song,\\"I Don't Want Your Love\\",\\"All She Wants\\",\\"Too Late Marlene\\" and \\"Drug (It's Just a State Of Mind\\" blend elements of the stripped down grooves of Minneapolis with many of the tight dance elements Nile Rodgers introduced beforehand into their general basic sound. The lyric subject matters range from unrequited romance to a double meaning either about chemeical and sexual addition. The rhythms are complex and spare,the chordal changes are actually very dark and subversive and the between the rhythm guitars,keyboards,Steve Ferrone's drumming and the layored horns it's hard to believe this is the music of a trio.  Also this is one of those \\"fast half,slow half\\" kind of records. On the other hand the second half of the album isn't as concretely slow as it seems. \\"Do You Believe In Shame\\",a thinly disguised diss at the departed Andy Taylor possess a similar type of dark flavor to some of the faster songs,especially in the melody. Songs such as \\"Palomino\\" and \\"Land\\",much in the spirit of funk music as a genre in and of itself brings in different rhythmic styles from latin to jazzy sounds into them and considering how well constructed the songs themselves are that type of rhythmic diversity does the overall sound a lot of good. There are two interludes which reach into the musical bag that actually concludes the album: \\"The Edge Of America\\" is a late 80's style psychedelic style groove that has a very big,bassy arrangement and a compelling lyric that explores the positive and negative side of the US politics and psyce at the time-coming to the conclusion they're both interrelated of course. That song bleeds into this stomping funk instrumental \\"Lake Shore Driving\\" which is..driven by a complusive and phat multi tracked bassline.  This may not be the kind of direct sort of sound that people were starting to expect from pop music in the late 80's. It's far from a new wave record and even though it's every bit as eclectic as any other Duran Duran album (no two sound alike) and that may be way this album got burried in a time when most pop was supposed to sound like one thing. All the same it's an important part of Duran Duran's musical legacy especially from a funk standpoint and should easily be mentioned in the same sentence as the better known previous record.the conclusion they're both interrelated of course.

1600242197|5.0|Audiobook<br />5 CDs<br />Approximately 6 hours.<br />Read by Kevin T. Collins<br /><br />I first heard the incredible story of Marcus Luttrell while hearing him tell his story on Glenn Beck's radio show. I'm not a frequent listener of Glenn's show but this story was so compelling I had to hear the whole thing.<br /><br />Lone Survivor is a much longer version of that story. It includes a long, detailed description of how Navy SEALs train and their \\"Hell Week\\" that washes out those who are not truly dedicated to being a SEAL. Luttrell also tells us about his childhood and how he aspired to be a member of a special forces unit as a young man in high school.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is about \\"Operation Redwing\\" - an attempt to kill or capture a Taliban leader that remains unnamed in the book (he uses a false name for this man throughout the book). The operation consists of inserting 4 SEALs in open mountain territory in Afghanistan to observe a remote village where this leader may or may not be staying.<br /><br />Operation Redwing has difficulties from the beginning, including a lack of cover to hide behind while observing the village and extremely steep terrain. Not long into the operation 3 Afghan goatherders stumple upon the 4 SEALs and nearly 100 Taliban soldiers start to hunt the 4 SEALs.<br /><br />Luttrell's tale of how his comrades died one by one in an intense running firefight is gripping and awe-inspiring. Eventually, Luttrell is the last one alive, although he is also shot in the leg and suffers from any number of cuts, bruises and a broken nose. He uses every trick he learned in survival training and a few that he learned as avid hunter back in Texas and is eventually rescued by an anti-Taliban village that risks the lives of the entire village by daring to take him in.<br /><br />Unlike another autobiographical tale of our current wars that I've recently read, [[ASIN:0812979567 Joker One: A Marine Platoon's Story of Courage, Leadership, and Brotherhood]], the strength of this book is not its writing. It is co-written by Patrick Robinson who lets Luttrell's voice come through loud and clear. If you are easily offended by liberal use of swear words as adjectives, this will not be the book for you. However, having known a few soldiers over the years I found it lent a good deal of authenticity to let Luttrell describe the battle as he normally would.<br /><br />No, the strength of the book is the power of the story itself. The decision to spare the lives of the goatherders (who presumably left the SEALs and immediately informed the Taliban), the vicious firefight, the loss of Luttrell's companions, the story of the village that rescued him, the pain his family went through when they believed he had also been killed... The story is so strong that it demands and deserves to be heard, even if its prose is not Pulitzer Prize material.<br /><br />Highly recommended.is co-written by Patrick Robinson who lets Luttrell's voice come through loud and clear.

B00000DQSV|5.0|Coming four years after their previous studio album [[ASIN:B00009L1OB Seven & The Ragged Tiger]] guitarist Andy Taylor had gone off to form Power Station with Robert Palmer and Chic drummer Tony Thompson so this left Duran Duran as a trio and with the obvious need for,among other reasons changes on the music scene to retool their sound a bit. Even on their breaktrhough album [[ASIN:B00005BJ9W Rio]] Duran Duran had evoloved into a very funk oriented band but then again that was often a big part of the British new wave scene anyway. By mid decade the UK R&B/dance/funk/jazz scene was exploding with bands such as Style Council,ABC,Level 42 and Heaven 17-all bands that had come into the picture during the same time as Duran Duran and it seemed they themselves were destined to dive headlong more fully into their R&B/funk side. So it was another former Chic member,famously funky producer Nile Rodgers who really changed things up for them at this time. Even though they'd basically disappeared from the scene and indicated they weren't planning on a comeback this \\"new\\" Duran Duran emmerged with a sound radically different than what they'd previously done before. The title song was a much deserved hit and one of the funkiest things to emmerge on the pop scene at that time,as well as serving to introduce this new sound of theirs to the pop world. The bands way with a strong melody and choruses are still at full power but the tempo is lowered to a tighter groove and the presense of Lenny Picket's Borneo Horns adds a whole other dimension to what they were doing musically. The middle area of this album doesn't necessarily follow in the exact same direction but maintains that general musical sensability. \\"American Science\\",Skin Trade\\",\\"Hold Me\\" and \\"Vertigo\\" all possess the same spirit as the opening title song but explore the rhythmic complexity and more of a brooding melodic flavor to an even greater degree. On \\"A Matter Of Feeling\\" and \\"Winter Marches On\\" the tempo is lowered even further to the pace of a midtempo slow jam with some eerie,sometimes almost jazzy chord progressions. Of course towards the conclusion of the album we're baught back to the same tight,horn packed funk groove that they started with on \\"Meet El Presidente\\",\\"Proposition\\" and the equally potent \\"So Mislead\\". In the end this was new abbreviated comeback for Duran Duran. They would not remain in this trio format forever but all the same they managed to fasion a successful return to the pop world by bringing one of their original flavors upfront more and thereby giving their approch a strong and as it turned out long lasting makeover.the tempo is lowered even further to the pace of a midtempo slow jam with some eerie,sometimes almost jazzy chord progressions.

0143118420|5.0|Eat, Pray, Love is the perfect story. It is true. It is honest. It is well written, and it has a happy ending. The tale begins with the author, at age thirty-four, in abject despair. In the early morning, before dawn, she is sobbing on her bathroom floor - her husband asleep in their bed just a few feet away. He is clueless. Two years later the author, Elizabeth Gilbert, is in a state of joy: In love with a turned-on and tuned-in, seasoned man of means and purpose.<br /><br />What happened? Gilbert made a decision to take full and complete, control and responsibility, of and for her life; and do what was (and is) necessary to become whole, or as she states it, find her balance. Her story is important and inspiring. The \\"cure\\" is universal, meaning it'll work every time for everyone. Is it easy? No. Is it a matter of geography, the \\"Geographic Cure?\\" No, though in Gilbert's case that was part of it. Is it a matter of resources - time and money and friends? No. Though again, in this case, as was the change of scene, resources played a part. Was it, at essence, just a matter of  \\"letting go and letting God,\\" or prayer. No.<br /><br />The cure is taking control of your mind. What you think creates what you feel; and what you feel--what you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch--determines your state of being, all the way from the bottom, despair, to the top, freedom, love, and joy. This state cannot be faked and it takes courage and strength to get there. Where does that come? Believe it or not, we are born with it. Gilbert discovers the Balinese have a sense of this, believing children, when born are gods; and do not even let their feet touch the ground for the first six months of their earthly existence.<br /><br />So what happens, how do gods, born with everything they/we need to live in joy and thrive, become so corrupted and miserable? That is not this story, but is mostly what does happen in the human experience. So a person, at some point, has to reclaim their power. That is this story--how to do it. The key is found in silence. It is in Book Two, \\"India,\\" that Gilbert comes to master meditation which is the path to transformation. What is meditation? Read the book ... . (Ha,ha, my little joke. And no, I'm not being paid by the author or publisher.) I've never read a better description of how difficult the practice of meditation is. It's not simple, easy, or quick - but it is free. Anyone, anywhere, of any means can do it. You don't have to go to India, you don't need money. You do need a little time, and a little self-control. (You were born with both.) And, it certainly helps to have a teacher. By teacher, I mean someone who sets an example, not someone who tells you what and how to meditate, or eat, or pray, or love. A guide.<br /><br />This book can be a guide, of sorts. Five stars and then some.-how to do it. The key is found in silence.

Two days later (thanks Amazon Prime) it arrived in a small box. I decided to buy this Amazon HDMI cable because it was 10 ft long and cheap. I connected it to my PS3 and it works just as well as my Monster Cable did. I like that it's not expensive compared to how much the Monster cables cost. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a HDMI cable.

I wanted to see what all the fuss was about..So far my husband and I are glued to the TV..we love the show! Great cast of people,very good story telling..Now, keep in mind I haven't made it to the last season..but to completely write off the whole show due to the ending..You can't make everyone happy all the time..I'm sure there are going to be some things I'll be saying..huh?what about this?? but you know what...I still would watch it..So what it's a big let down in the end..It was a very nice trip to get there...and you learn and grow to love all the characters of the show..There has been some moments where I have got teary eyes and even softly cried without anyone knowing...and I'm sure I will cry at the end..I'm not someone trying to pedal-push the show, I don't have any part to do with the show..besides buying my little copies of each series..lol I wish I would have been able to go hang out in Hawii with the cast.. :-) (I read someones comment saying all the 5 star reviews where from someone associated with the show) Anyways, both my husband and I started watching Lost knowning that there's going to be this BIG disappointment in the end..We both just wanted to see how the first season was...let me tell you I'm so glad we did! :-) As for any of you people out there who haven't seen it..don't go by what is said from these reviews...each person is different..Watch it for yourself..I'm sure glad I didn't listen to all the negative reviews for the show.. :-) and you don't have to go buy the seasons...you can go rent them...I started watching the first season on netflix... :-) (I really don't care if it's a let down when I start watching season 6...It's been a fun ride!!)if it's a let down when I start watching season 6...It's been a fun ride!!)

I checked out the video for Final Frontier and got the El Dorato as a freebie from the bands website. This is by far their best work in a long time, the best album in my opinion was Piece  of Mind, sort of like Slayer's Reign in Blood. This album is great from beginning to end, the only regret may become the long album intro...
B0034U4QLM|5.0|This CD helped me to appreciate the situation of the Irish Americans who served in the US Army then decided to join the Mexicans. When the Irish first came to America they faced the oppression of the Protestant majority.  Political parties such as the 'Know Nothings' did not want Irish Catholics in the US.  When these Catholics join the army they faced  discrimination from the Protestant troops.  When they were sent to the Mexican/Texan border they identified with the Mexicans because of their common religion and also there historically dislike for the English.<br /><br />Books such as \\"The Rogue's March\\" by Peter F. Stevens and \\"The Irish Soldiers of Mexico by Michael Hogan give good descriptions of why these soldiers joined Mexico.  They were not  really deserters.  Rather they were joining the army they could most identify with.  The barbarism and cruelty show by the US command to these soldiers only reinforces the correctness of the decisions made by these proud soldiers.<br /><br />Later in the US civil war in their desire to join in and become part of America the Irish were very brave and proud soldiers on both sides.

B0000019PA|5.0|I had never heard of this band before, knew nothing about Jeff Mangum, and had no clue what style of music this would be.  But I stumbled upon Amazon's list of the Top 100 Indie albums of all time, and saw this listed at #2.  So intrigued by the brief description, I decided to download it on a whim.    A little while later, I was listening to Two-Headed Boy, LITERALLY with tears running down my face.  I had no clue what the song was about, and at the time I did not know about the album's focus on the Holocaust and Anne Frank.  But it didn't matter.  I was moved to tears simply by the music, and the raw emotion in the singer's voice.  It was a strange and almost mystical experience, and I will never forget it.    Buy this CD, and I hope you will be moved by the passion and pain in this music, as I was.
B00000JQFL|5.0|This album is Earth, Wind and Fire at its best! I enjoy the live portions and the studio portions are great as well. This music makes you think about some current issues in addition to sounding great.
B001684L0A|5.0|I had already seen this series on HBO but wanted it for my home collection.  The Blu Ray of course makes the production a little crisper on the HDTV.

0887307280|5.0|This book is striking from the beginning because it was like a refreshing breeze on a hot and humid summer day. In an age where many businesses are chaotic, without vision, and without direction this book reminds us of the power, and wealth-building potential, of engineering, uniformity, and simplicity. While the book is targeted to small business many of the biggest corporations can definitely benefit from its wisdom. Some of the worlds' most famous franchises are evidence the utility of an engineered approach to business. In my opinion this should be required reading, and mastery of concept, for any executive.

B0017U7PT6|4.0|First of all, if historical innaccuracies and a visionary tale that uses creative license to the max are not your style, then this is not the film for you. BUT......least we all be reminded that recently (within the last 10-15 years) many worldly discoveries have shaped or re-shaped many peoples ideas of the past. The idea that Atlantis is or was what we now know as Cuba. The oldest ruins actually carbon dated on earth are not found in Egypt, England, the Netherlands or even Iceland, but on the island of Malta. And there is still some debate about different types of ore being used for weapons long before iron was used, or better put KNOWN to be used. So if you can, or even want to, open your mind a little, and watch this story for what it is, a visionary tale that is not great by any means, but uses a lot of creative license and somewhat imaginitive story telling that crosses many boundries. I gave the movie a 4 star rating, because I took it for what it was, or what I thought it was meant to be, a story that was more fantasy than just fiction, more about imagination than accuracy. If you can do that, you might enjoy this film. As always, the best way is to judge for yourself. By the way, this movie looks great on Blu-Ray and a Plasma HDTV.

B003JIPJRE|5.0|I've been saddened by the inaudible, grunting Batman in the recent movies. You'd need subtitles to follow along with what those guys are saying, and even then it needs interpreting. Batman: Under the Red Hood I rented on a whim, now I have every intention to own it.    The action is fantastic, some of the wildest pursuits and face crunching fights in Batman history. Aside from that it's very well drawn, great visuals on everything from the explosions to the background objects you'd probably not notice at first glance. The story is phenomenal from the start, beginning with a scene that is grueling and following up with loads of surprises with only a few expected occurrences. How it ends is probably the most exciting finish I've seen to date, with hatred and a plethora of other emotions fighting for dominance. On top of that, a certain someone who adds his signature wit throughout the movie brings moments where it's genuinely funny.    The choice of enemies in this one was the most impressive. Not to give too much away but seeing Black Mask play a major role was great. Ra's al Ghul plays an even bigger role, both characters that are rarely given the face time they deserve in Batman flicks. I don't want to reveal any details about the story itself but Red is the real deal. He proves throughout the movie he can go toe to toe with the Bat and hold up better than even the most seasoned villains (again, the pursuits are what really blow me away about this movie, he is not easily shadowed).     Renting this movie is a poor decision. You can buy it with confidence, you won't be disappointed. And if you are one of the handful who don't enjoy this movie, then riddle me this, what Batman have you been watching all these years? Because this is easily the best in years.
B003HKN52A|4.0|Yes that is it. Maybe the Blu-Ray would be so special. But this is the original Movie on DVD. I have a regular DVD Player with Component Vid cables. New DVDs are great! This is Just better than the VHS ONLY because it is so old!<br /> I do not see a difference so much at all. I am NOT bashing this DVD. BUt expected a larger difference. Like the Box sets of The Aloha Special and the 68 Comeback sets They have a noticable difference and are great! This one could have been way better. I love it!

B002XMGGK6|4.0|When I saw this film advertised for theatres, I thought it was an action film.  I don't think it was marketed well.  Law Abiding Citizen goes way beyond action, though it does have some explosive sequences.  It's actually more of a noir thriller, with many plot twists and unexpected diversions.  It had many elements that reminded me of films like Phone Booth, Die Hard With a Vengeance and even Speed.  The trailer made it out as a simple criminal versus a virtuous DA, but it's much deeper than that.  Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are playing a deadly game against one another, and there is no black and white.  Butler's character is supposedly \\"the villain,\\" but one that is so easy to sympathize with, even justified in his actions. The film really highlights many of the problems in our criminal justice system, lending the story credibility and realism.  The plot kept me guessing as to just how Butler was accomplishing his objectives.  However, I do think the ending could have been better.  After so much clever cat and mouse, the climax was too simple and didn't live up to what came before.  Overall though, it was an exciting film that kept me paying close attention and on the edge of my seat.  Also, the acting from the two leads was top notch, and even the supporting cast was noticeably superb.<br /><br />The DVD has some well done extras, including featurettes on special effects shots and behind the scenes.  However, the best featurette discusses the law behind the film.  Experts explain the actual statutes that impact the characters in the film and how they are realistically played out in the story.  It added a lot to the film, basing the plot on more than than just getting off on \\"a technicality.\\"  The extras add to the film experience.  Well worth the money; I'll definitely watch this again.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|Awesome doesn't begin to describe this.    Playing For Change has changed my life. Their music is captivating and inspiring to all that hear it. I personally believe that everyone on the planet should see, hear and be a part of this. Great music, great musicians, great vibe. It doesn't matter what genre of music you listen to, you will like this .... i cannot say enough good things about Playing For Change.   Buy this CD/DVD you will only thank yourself for doing it.  One Love!
0143058525|4.0|I fought reading this book.  I figured if Oprah loved it, then I was sure to hate this and not get past the third chapter. Then my aunt recommended it, and then the buzz because of the movie...So I broke down and bought it as an audiobook.  And I couldn't stop listening!  Especially loved the 1st and 2nd thirds of the book.  It touched me because I am 34 and making the same choices in my life that the author was making.  I chose husband and child instead, and enjoyed reading about the travels and trials of a person who chose the other side of that coin.  I enjoyed her journey. I laughed and I listened and I lived through her.  Wasn't as excited about the ending as I could have been, but it was her journey and not mine and I was glad she invited me along for the ride!  Most of us push so hard to reach our goals in life that we forget to live, and, for a moment, I lived the things she lived.  I applaud her for having the nerve to do what she did.  Read(or listen)to this book!
B003X73QA8|3.0|[[ASIN:B003O85W3A The Suburbs]]  I was waiting for this album to come out and bought it the first day. I've listened to it about four times and each time I realize that I just don't like this album, because it's boring. For the most part it sounds like classic Arcade Fire, but just not as good. I'd rather listen to one of their older albums. On a positive note, I really like the song Sprawl II. There are a couple other good songs but Sprawl II really jumps out. Hope this was helpful for someone.
B000002KCC|5.0|I had just read the section in the book Shakey about the recording of this album and though I have the old LP, it was great to get the CD and listen to it with a new perspective.  I also recommend the books Shakey and Neil & Me.
B0025KVLUQ|2.0|I was musically aware when the beatles emerged, and I became musically knowledgable during their long musical dominance.  I KNOW how Abbey Road is supposed to sound and I can't believe everyone is giving this crap a pass.  The remastering favors the bass to the detriment of the entire experience.  The original sound had a wonderful balance of bass, voice, rhythm.    This mix sux  I bought this to replace my lost CD, and decided to pay extra bucks and go for what these clowns consider an excellent mix.  I'm going back and buying the older version.    How long are these remasters going to continue being horrifically botched versions of imbalance.    I'm giving 2 stars because after all, this IS the Beatles.     Don't record producers know that George Martin LIVES and might still be available for consultation???
030745455X|5.0|This is the second in a trilogy by S.Larrson.  Like the first one (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is the type of book you can hardly put down.  Well written and maintains the reader constantly in suspense.  Can't hardly wait to read the third book.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Read this book on my ereader.  It was a good read all-in-all.  At times, it was a little like reading Tolkein because of the hard to pronounce names of people and places.  A little twist to the plot here and there.  Worth your time.  Warning; some violence and definate adult content!
0307454541|5.0|This book is an excellent read. Most the characters are well developed and very interesting. After the first 100-150 pages it is really tough to put down. Salander is one of the best characters I've ever read and you'll enjoy seeing how she evolves from book to book.
B002ZG98M8|5.0|When I first saw the movie's ad displayed on a london bus, i didn't realize that this is the same Predator kinda movie I used to love watching when i was a kid (the predator head wasn't very clear in the ad). Then I looked it up online and realized it was the same movie, however I didn't understand why it's called Predators instead of Predator (singular), then i watched the movie's trailer and realized that this time the humans are up against a group of predators, and also this time it won't be in planet earth but rather in the predator's planet!     I totally loved the idea. It reminds you so much of the original predator with Arnold schwarzenegger. It is packed with action and has lots of great actors and actresses too. I loved how they got Oleg Taktarov, the famous UFC champion, and Morpheos (the guy from the matrix), and all the rest of the tough looking crew in the movie. But of course, they were all no match for the mighty predators.     Wonderful Comeback after the lousy AVP series.     Great Movie, Must Have On Blue Ray.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Most classic line in the whole thing was from Gene listed as my title.    5 stars, awesome.......    Yeah, Ohhhhh  Yeahhhhhhhhhh!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford & Sons 'Sigh No More' is one of the most incredible albums I've heard in a long time. From the moment I came across them (thanks to last.fm) I knew I had to have this album. And I was not disappointed in any way. Every song on this album is out of this world. The lyrics are awesome, the instruments are wonderful, and the sound of the lead singers voice is lovely. I honestly can't get enough of these guys. Their sound is different than most of that mainstream junk that plays on the radio these days, so refreshing. You honestly can't go wrong in purchasing this complete album; every song is worth it and I mean $5 - you can't beat that. I look forward to hearing so much more from them soon.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|The late 1960s was an era of great experimentation in music, and Miles Davis made his contribution to this trend with \\"In a Silent Way,\\" which jazz critics consider his first fusion recording--the album has elements of both jazz and rock.  Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock were in Davis's band for \\"In a Silent Way,\\" and the album has long been considered a jazz classic.  This music is evocative of being on a late-night car journey, and fans of psychedelic rock who are new to jazz would love this album.
0061998494|5.0|I am really enjoying this book .I am a major fan of the author. I recieved it in a very timely manner so I am happy. It is very well written.
B002ZG97E2|5.0|This was a GREAT movie.  My 6 year old and I went to see it.  We laughed so hard.  It was so good that I wanted to stay in the theater to watch it a 2nd time.  I can't wait to buy it on dvd/blu-ray.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I have read and watched Band of Brothers, so maybe I have been influenced by the overall complete coverage of the 506th PIR based on both the author and producers. Basically, THE PACIFIC felt like it was produced in a very quick manner. I can somewhat understand the reason the story feeling rushed which basically comes down to the fact they had to condense five (5) years worth of war into a finite amount of shows. Whereas, Band of Brothers focused on the inception of the 506th PIR in 1943 and finishing in 1945.    In addition, because the movie felt rushed the viewer may not feel the same connection to the characters like you did in Band of Brothers. I found the book THE PACIFIC to be the only way I could connect to the characters and it was beneficial to read that along with watching the mini-series.     The special effects felt just like that... special effects. There were certain times where the effects looked real but on a whole it looked a little too CGI'ed and lacked the authenticity of Band of Brothers. I also understand it's hard to recreate a war scene with authentic tanks used by the Japanese and maybe that's why the movie looked it had too much CGI for being shot on location or very close to the same locations where the battles took place.     As for the historical accuracy I completely enjoyed the mini-series. It definitely brought everything I had learned about the War in the Pacific into perspective. I have watched many movies about the War in the Pacific and none of them gave you a great feeling for the real fight the United States Navy and Marines fought.
1439153663|5.0|This one is a keeper. I can think of nothing to change to improve it. Kathleen Grisson has made a tremendous amount of research come alive. An orphaned Irish girl is taken as indentured servant and lives with the Kitchen House slaves. She finds herself becoming a part of their family as she is treated with kindness and gentleness.<br /><br /> Lavina learns what it is like to be in constant fear of the all powerful masters of the Big house. She sees the<br />consequential cruelty of people who think of their slaves as property and not as human beings. Lavina is white but her real home or heart is with the family who raised her with a lot of love and care.<br /><br /> At the same time, Belle, the master's illegimate daughter's speaks in alternate chapters her own point of view. She sees the naviety of Lavina and has to deal with<br />position of being half white but still a slave. Terrible things happen and you wish that you could go into the book to prevent them. In an interview in the back of the<br />book, Kathleen Grisson even says that she wanted to strike some of the horrible things that happened but that characters themselves would not let her hide them.<br /><br /> I don't want to spoil the story for anyone by telling more details, but I feel this book is a must read for everyone.

B0000A0DRY|4.0|1967 was an amazing time for rock music and in the US alone The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Love and Bob Dylan were among many artists to put out top class material.  Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow, is another significant release, and was sandwiched between their debut Jefferson Airplane Takes Off and After Bathing At Baxters, neither which I have heard as yet.  The album has some good quiet folk/rock love songs, although 3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds is a louder song.   My favourite tracks are the unbeatable Somebody To Love (originally Someone To Love when performed by Grace Slick And The Great Society), White Rabbit and the all too short acoustic Embryonic Journey.  There are 6 bonus songs, the first 4 lean towards a blues sound, which is not really to my taste.  Finally there are mono versions of Somebody To Love and White Rabbit, the latter has a surprise acoustic part tacked on the end.  Mid 1960s fans are likely to enjoy this one.
B001W63DX2|5.0|Loved it from start to finish. Its great to hear from the guys themselves. Watching Bruce fly the plane was great then the Live set DVD, unbelievable!
B003JTHESA|4.0|I seen Iron Maiden on this tour in July and could'nt wait for this Cd to be released. I am impressed this Cd is well done. Iron Maiden prove Heavy metal is alive in 2010. For a band in their 50s they have not lost their punch in the studio or live. I can not warm up to the newer metal bands and the raw screaming vocals. Thanks Iron Maiden for giving a good Metal Cd I can jam to
B001FB55H6|5.0|For less than half the cost of purchasing in store (not to mention having to find a copy somewhere since it's been deleted) i had this delivered to me in Sydney, Aus. Then there's the superior cover art. No contest.
0316010669|4.0|The description that something `makes you think' no longer means that something `fills your mind with novel thought,' but rather that something `makes you skeptical of established beliefs.' The new meaning is useful, but some things out there just fill you with inspirational and amazing thoughts and those valuable things are what should receive the description. Malcolm Gladwell's `Blink' is one of those valuable things.    This is ironic, of course, because the whole book is dedicated to turning off thinking--the author aims to \\"think without thinking.\\"  Gladwell says that we may be \\"better off without thinking,\\" but what makes his book so fascinating is that it makes you wonder, speculate, and think.    He makes his case for `snap decisions' well by describing examples when `thinking too much' led to incorrect and sometimes expensive mistakes. The book's opening example of museum curators who tirelessly studied a potential acquisition with the finest carbon dating tools and latest scientific processes was compelling. The curators concluded that the acquisition was authentic and bought the piece for millions of dollars only to find out later that it was a fake. All of their `thinking' couldn't uncover the truth that (as it turned out) experts could easily pick out in the `blink of an eye.'    The moral (although not completely explained in the book) is that science, procedure, and thinking in general require `abstraction,' which is the process of reducing the whole truth into a smaller, more easily accessible truth. This allows us to expand our knowledge and hold on to it much longer than if we attempted to remember the whole truth. Since it is not the whole truth, the process of abstraction can distort or lose the truth altogether. As such, we would sometimes do better by scraping all our abstract knowledge and simply focusing on what we see in front of us. This is the central theme of `Blink.'    Of course, the fact remains that without abstraction we could not know as much or remember as long as we do, and most human advance would be lost. Abstraction is a tool that has been elemental in man's ascent and cannot be discarded as completely obstructive.    The author even proves this fact in his effort to diminish thinking. That is because many of his examples feature scientists' elaborate experiments aimed ascertaining the importance of simple, split-second judgment. Thinking is used to denigrate thinking.    Inconsistencies like this foil any attempt at producing a solid idea and in the end `Blink' becomes not more than a series of stories. Most of the stories are really fascinating and invigorating and it must be said that they are expertly written. It is for these stories that one should pick up the book. But, ultimately, the stories (all stories) are just examples taken out of context--they are abstractions and lead to the same kind of mistakes Gladwell is trying to abolish.    Read the book, but enjoy how much it makes you think and it will be worth it.
1439181780|5.0|The Secret changed my life. My outlook changed positive on everything. Whatever was left out in the Secret is covered in the Power. The quotes are inspirational.

The truth, or whatever would make me look good.\\"<br /><br />This novel started off at a fast pace and kept me glued to the pages.  Elaine is the victim of the bullying of a group of three girls who are considered her friends.  Although they are supposed to be friends they make Elaine a scapegoat for everthing that happens in the three girls' lives.  She is obedient to their punishment, becasue she thinks she really deserves it. But suddenly one day that all changes and we are brought into the the future lives of these young women. Not a bad book but very detailed, and towards the end I was gettinga little weary of it.<br />Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (Haze... August 21st, 2010)
B003JTHESA|1.0|I have been listening to Iron Maiden for a while and have almost everything they've recorded. I really, really like Iron Maiden and there is no other band like it. However, this last album is just not for me.    I like Iron Maiden because of its fast paced, high energy rhythm and the skill of the guitarists, but those attributes are not present in this album. The songs in this album lack \\"climax\\" and the guitars are mediocre at best; it just seems they put out an album just for the heck of it. The style of The Final Frontier reminds me too much of Aerosmith, a band I thoroughly dislike.    The newest album I have besides this one is A Matter of Life and Dead and while I liked it, it was certainly less appealing to me than the previous albums so I thought maybe their new stuff wasn't for me. Nevertheless, I was very excited that they were putting out a new album so I thought I should check it out. Well, I guess, in my opinion, anything recorded by them after the mid 90's just isn't appealing to me. Maybe they are trying to cater to a newer audience, kinda like Metallica with their new \\"pop culture\\" style which is very different from their early stuff.     If you want to listen to more \\"traditional\\" Iron Maiden then try their 80's and 90's stuff, this album in no way represents the style this band embraced for decades.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|The experience of watching these videos is incredible. Watching the \\"Fresh Water\\" and \\"Mountain\\" episodes, a couple personal favorites, is an awe-inspiring, emotional, and simply fun experience. Standing in front of the TV screen during the scenes with huge high-definition shots of beautiful snow-covered peaks and foaming waterfalls makes me feel as if I'm right there. I would highly recommend this product. The only thing is that there was a bit of a delay with the delivery, and it came more than a week past the last day in the estimated arrival time. However, once it came, I can honestly say that I was impressed.
0385333846|5.0|If you are not a huge Vonnegut fan I think you will still enjoy this book. If you a Vonnegut fan and have not read it yet (shame on you) you will love it.
B003BKF696|4.0|There's a droning quality to The National's sound, from the low throbbing bass and drums found on most of the songs to Matt Berninger's vocals, which even when pushing forward emotional resonance on songs like \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio\\" and \\"Runaway\\" still sound incredibly restrained as if there is a danger if he loses control. This will not be everyone's favorite sound, but I found it works very well with the songs content; songs where a little darkness seems to haunt the lyrics. From songs like \\"Conversation 16\\" with its \\"'Cause I'm evil\\" refrain and lyrics like,     \\"Im a confident liar  Have my head in the oven so you know where i'll be  I try to be more romantic  i wanna believe in everything you believe,\\"    to outright distrust of the way the media is moving on \\"Afraid of Everyone\\" this sound is an effective medium for the message. As a whole this weighty sound can wear you down a bit and an occasional lightening of it would be welcome; not everything needs to have this serious \\"anthem\\" energy, but I find this has depth that holds up well after repeated plays and new levels of complexity are constantly being discovered.

0307454541|3.0|I was half way through a dull autobiography when my 14 year old niece recommended The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Seemingly, the title made me prognosticate that this would be a chick read (not to mention a teenage female referenced it to me).  Like usual though, the standard clich&eacute; applied to Larsson's text:  \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\"<br /><br />I appreciated the surprises that continually and unexpectedly developed.  It started out with Blomkvist, a journalist recently convicted of libel, being asked to help solve the Vanger Family's forty year old murder.  Blomkvist doubted himself from the beginning, and he had every reason to.  As the story unfolded, it was hard to put the book down.<br /><br />Blomkvist eventually teamed up with a teenage girl, Lisbeth, who was dealing with finding her identity while having a distinct quality that every person would envy.  Larsson narrated the book in a 3rd person omniscient point of view.  The book rotated from Blomkvist to Lisbeth until they coincidently connect through the Vanger family.<br /><br />The plot seems complacent, but there's more that meets the eye.  Telling the resolution and how it ended up being that way would just ruin this book and the mysterious picture it captivated.  In between trying to solve the case, Blomkvist dealt with relationship and legal issues.  Lisbeth experienced very harsh circumstances too. A love triangle may also have surfaced.  Blomkvist saw a neutral side of the Vanger family.  What family is perfect?  Is there always a happy ending? Read this book and you will not be disappointed. There will be some surprises along the way, but it all makes perfect sense when the dust settles.
0393312836|5.0|Burgess novel in some ways is more enjoyable than Kubrick's masterpiece. The book is more of a satire than the movie, so it allows you to laugh out loud as well as cringe. Burgess, who was a musician prior to being a writer, has a very lyrical style to his writing which makes the spoken language a blast to read. As the kids say \\"real horrorshow.\\"
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|I can't even believe this album. When one of my favorite artists comes out with a new album I sometimes get worried will it be as good as the last one. But with Ray I'm never thinking that. Every album that he has ever dropped has been the Sheez Neez. I even came across some unreleased songs that were incredible; definitely album quality.     You rarely get artists who see the world as it is and can relate. Such as the song 'Old Before Your Time' where he says, \\"The saddest thing in the world is talking to a man that never knew his world is for the making.\\" Or 'New York City's Killing Me' where he reflects on walking down the street and no one looks him in the eye and doesn't seem to care whether you live or die. A sad but true statement that seems to ripple across all society. And if you ever had a lost love then listen to 'Are We Really Through' and 'Like Rock & Roll and Radio'(and if you can, try to find 'Half Crazy' and 'Isabel') these songs will cut through any cold heart and make you truly feel.     To put it plainly RayCharles LaMontagne is certified as one of the greats. His vocals reign supreme on every song. He puts his heart into each song and knows it so well. If people actually bought music for the heart and soul and not for sex and lust, Ray LaMontagne would sell millions and millions.     EXCELLENT JOB WELL DONE MY FRIEND AND THANK YOU!!!
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Brilliant !!  Great !!  Excellent !!  Oh, that's three words...whatever.  White Collar is easily the best show on TV.  This cast has no rivals and that includes everyone behind the scenes.  While Matt Bomer (Caffrey) will get most of the pub, Tim DeKay (Burke) absolutely nails it.  Other reviews will explain the plot etc. of the show.  I'll just say \\"get this 4-DVD set and see something rare...entertainment with talent\\".  What a show !!!

I will watch this movie many times over.

0307454541|3.0|I decided to finally read this novel after heaving rave review from friends and seeing it on bookshelves everywhere. I'm not going to summarize the plot since that has been done many times, but to briefly outline what put me off this novel despite its literary merit.<br /><br />Let my first say that I did not give this novel only three stars because I think it is a mediocre book, but because I found myself unable to enjoy it. It is written very well, the plot is detailed and tight, and the characters are complex, though I didn't feel particularly attached to them. The book is an interesting window into the darker side of a country which I think is often idealized by non-Europeans. For me, however, it was too dark.<br /><br />The original title in the Swedish was \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" though the title was changed to make it more palatable for American audiences. Changing the title, of course, did nothing for the content, and I think the original title better suited the book. The whole mystery of the novel and the past of the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" herself revolves around women-hating, Nazi, torturing, sadistic, incestuous rapists. I don't believe in censorship, and often uncomfortable material is the most enlightening, but you should definitely think about whether you can stomach a graphic description of sadistic rape before picking up this book. I also feel that this novel portrays Sweden almost too darkly. The rates of rape in the U.S. for example are drastically higher than in Sweden, yet this book makes you think Sweden is full of corrupt entrepreneurs and murdering Nazis rapists that run rampant. I wish I'd been warned before reading it so I could have braced myself.
B002N5N5M0|4.0|First off, I love all 4 seasons. Dexter is by far my favorite show to date. However, season 4 imo was the first to take a step backwards since the show began. Dexter being a father and a married man, found himself more restricted and couldnt be the good ol Dexyboy that I came to root for. The writers couldnt ignore his new found responsibilities. As I like to say, they wrote themselves into a corner. Its a shame too, because season 4 started off with such promise. I was overjoyed to hear that John Liftgow was coming onboard. But there were very few instances inwhich season 4 really reached out and grabbed me if you will. But like I said earlier, its still a great season. Its just when you compare it to the others, its the weakest. Its like me saying that my 1 million dollars isnt as good as your 1 million and twenty. Its all relative.     SPOILER SPOILER    As we saw with the last episode of season 4, the grandparents of the children appear for the first time. It would be my guess that the children will live with them as Dexter gets his life back together.   There are several trailers out there for season 5 and needless to say, it looks promising. I think the show will return to its season 1-3 style. Cant wait.
0345455681|5.0|I had a hard time deciding whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars at first.<br /><br />Rutherfurd employs the same formula he used in his first two books, Sarum: The Novel of England and Russka: The Novel of Russia, which, as I have stated in earlier reviews, are both excellent works. My hesitancy in awarding five stars in this case stems from the fact that I didn't enjoy 'London' as much as 'Sarum'. In my review of 'Russka' I also said the same thing, but, in that case, I noted that my relative enjoyment of the two works was determined by my relative interest in the separate topics and not on the quality of the writing. In 'London', I have to say, this is not the case; the characters and family histories in 'London' are not quite as engaging as in 'Sarum' and I was, on the whole, just a bit disappointed. I expected to enjoy it more.<br /><br />So... why am I still awarding this book five stars? Despite it's failure to achieve the immense readability of 'Sarum' it is still a well-researched book and, unlike 'Russka', I have read it twice already and will probably read it at least one more time.

0449000729|5.0|I first read this book about 20 years ago and have read it many times since. I have found that I can generally read and enjoy a good book about 8 or nine times before I have finally read it too many times. I am hoping to get one more read out of 'Sarum'. It will always number amongst the best books I have read.<br /><br />The format of the book is a necessary one given the sheer temporal scope of some 12,000 years. The opening chapter deals with events about 10,000 BC and then the ones that follow jumps ahead in time with successive jumps becoming shorter as the book progresses. The second chapter, for example, covers a period some 6000 years after the first whilst only 40 odd years separate the penultimate chapter from the last. This is a 'historical' novel rather than a history and, as noted in the product description, the book follow successive generations of five families. Not each family appears in each chapter, especially towards the beginning of the book, and, whilst this could be difficult to follow for some, the front pages contain a tree diagram that allows the reader to look up characters and their inter-relationships.<br /><br />Reader response to this book seems to be very varied; some love it, others found it hard to read and poorly done. Obviously, I am in the former group. Rutherfurd's characters and their dialogue were all believable and the prose style very light. There are a couple of chapters I tended to skip in later reads but that was really just a matter of taste rather than a criticism of their quality, except, perhaps, for the last few chapters which seemed banal. It was also apparent, I think, that the author was getting a bit tired and rushed to complete the last few centuries.<br /><br />All in all, 'Sarum' is a great book. Rutherfurd has tried to capitalize on the success of the book by repeating the formula in some successive works. In Russka: The Novel of Russia he managed to achieve the same high quality result (although the subject matter was not quite as interesting to me), and he approached the same readability in London: The Novel, albeit not quite as successfully. The Forest was a bit of a disappointment, I am sorry to say, whilst Rutherfurd's Irish novels were very poorly executed and I was actually unable to finish one of them.<br /><br />It is a shame that the works that followed 'Sarum' were not quite as good, but that will not stop me from purchasing further books my Mr Rutherfurd.nteresting to me), and he approached the same readability in London: The Novel, albeit not quite as successfully.

1601251505|4.0|The folks at paizo went a different direction from Wizards. Using the OGL, they attempted to fix some of the balance issues of 3.5 edition. This book is essentially the PHB and DMG in one (the bestiary is the MM). It's a worthwhile change, but if you're expecting something revolutionary, you may be disappointed. Personally, I found it to be incredibly useful and fair at Amazon's price.

0446563048|4.0|\\"Delivering Happiness\\" is part memoir, part business history of Zappos. The memoir part is interesting, albeit seemingly no different from dozens of other profiles of dot com millionaires: \\"overnight\\" success, lots of red bull, hundred million dollar exit, parties, and then the money is gone. The Zappos history is more interesting, especially from a viewpoint of evolution of the company. Zappos is known for \\"culture\\", but this concept of \\"culture\\" was not there from the very beginning - it was a conscious decision made a few years into the company, driven by business observations and landscape.  Recommended read for every entrepreneur.
