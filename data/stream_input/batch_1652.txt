B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked that this story was told from both characters point of view but found the ending disappointing and unbelievable. I am looking to read his other books.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|Bought this item at the end of may, used it with my IPod for about 4 months, it has now stopped working, went to Amazon to try and return, they said the return window expired.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This is the last in the Harry Potter series. It is amazing. I watched people cry in the theater. It's that good. I cried blood.
B004QZ9P6K|4.0|Well written, easy to read, ilustrative with specific examples of why Israel´s start-up policy is so effective. They outgrew business socialism to a better free wheel economic  model, matching the ideology and mentality of the israeli business man to their governmental impulse for new business and success. This is a good example of understanding the specifics of your population and creating business models for support and creation of all good ideas.
0515142247|5.0|Dude. This is Lee Child. I don't see why anyone needs to know anything else. Buy this book. Read it, then buy the next one and so on. This series is fantastic. Every one of the books is so exciting and then funny and then nerve-wracking, but never fear! Reacher will handle it!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Excellent show. Well filmed and sound is great. Very professionally done. Excellent cast. Strongly recommend. Shipped quickly as efficiently. Would buy again.
B003L77GRY|5.0|Cannot go wrong with Dexter on blu-ray. Buy this. Buy it now. You will love it. If not, you can find me and kill me in a room that is prepared just like Dad taught you, so as to not leave any evidence behind. Oh my gosh, can you imagine!?
B007SSEU9O|1.0|other than the great acting of Meryl Streep, it was not good at all. The whole movie is about prime minister disease or dementia. They could make much much better movie.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The Big Bang Theory has been my Favorited show since season one. This group of genius are hilarious. I enjoy especially Sheldon characterization by Jim Parsons. Besides, the scientific information is very well present to us on marvelous funny ways, that make science things acceptable to the TV audiences. Furthermore,the writers are making the sexual contents enjoyable and acceptable to the entire family.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is really fun but complicated at sometimes. acorns should be easier to get but its great regardless :).
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This novel was way too graphic and lacking in plot to keep<br />me interested.  I did finish reading it; but, from the middle on,<br />I was hoping it would end soon.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|This cd is LOUD and HEAVY and it's NOISE! Amy Lee herself has admitted that, but it's beautiful noise. I have been listening to these songs basically on repeat for the past year and each time it just gets better. I need to buy a new cd, I haven't taken it out of my car's cd player in so long. People don't understand that this is a collective effort, it is not all about amy's beautiful vocals anymore. It's about Will's drums and Troy's excellent guitar skills too. The different elements in this album mix and blend in a way that just works! I would love to have a purely instrumental version of this cd, but I can't find one. :(  The best part of The Open Door was that Amy's voice was deeper, richer and louder than all else, but the music was pretty weak. Now I feel that it's all blended beautifully.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I love this game. I cannot wait for part II.  I enjoyed almost everything about it.  The story was great and the hog's were challenging.  Kept me busy for quite a while
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It took me 15 hours to read this book. I was so engulfed in it that my daily activities were done half fasted and rushed just to that I could get back to reading.<br />Gideon and Eva are 2 lovers that I wish were real life, I would love to know everything about them day to day. Everything that occurred in this book made me emotional. I wanted to slap Gideon at times, I wanted to slap Eva at times, and then when everything came around I was literally slapping my self and screaming, \\"AHHH SHIT!\\"<br /><br />Great story!!!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|You will laugh, you might even cry.  It's a true American classic.  The characters are very real and very funny.  I reread this book every couple of years for a laugh.  It never gets old.
0316228532|1.0|The book was somewhat cute, a maze of subplots coming together for a flat ending.  It was not as well written at the Potter series.  The author's knowledge of British hamlet life today and it's street talk was impressive, although it did nothing for the story line - Krystal et al became boring.  Over all, it would have been a good $5.00 paperback to speed read on a flight, but there was no substance.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest except that there is no pin it button app the kindle fire.  the recipes and ideas you can find are really fun to try.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Tried it for two weeks and lost 10 lbs.    ate     whatever I wanted and was amazed@ feel better! also go for it.. Has been five weeks without wheat. I have lost 17 lbs . I am 5 ft 8 and now weigh 122 Lbs. This is without exercise and eating anything else I wanted to eat without concern of calories. I, and everyone I know are AMAZED. (Oh, and I also am a 55 year old woman) Many of my friends and family are going to stop eating wheat as an experiment. This is not diet.  READ THE BOOK. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is the first time I ordered a video online for instant viewing.  I was really surprised at the ease ansd simplicity of the process.  have used the service a few more times and have not been disappointed.  The movie was a good choice too!!  I really like the combination sci-fi and earth as a battle-zone type flick. There was a fresh spin on the love story angle as well.  The only criticism is NOT ENOUGH LIAM for me.  Great job amazon.
0385737955|4.0|Without his memory, Thomas is thrown into a world full young men trying to find their way out of the bad life they are living in. Unfortunately none of the boys have their memories and all they can do is run the maze outside the walls of their compound to find a way out.  Inside Thomas mind is hidden the clues that he must put together in time to save everyone from the horrendous machine/animal grievers wanting to feast on them.<br /><br />Thomas along with all the Gladers has no memory of why he is there or what they are suppose to do. Since the story is told from the point of view of someone without a memory, it leaves tons of mystery. No one including Thomas can tell what it means, especially after a girl shows up hold a note saying that the game is ending.<br /><br />Why does everyone feel the need to leave a cliff hanger these days? I feel that this was nicely done for the most part, but it still irks me when I get to one. That is why I try to not read stories until all are published, to avoid the one year wait on most big publishing house books.
0345803493|5.0|Great book, the purchase was well worth the money! Must read the first book before reading the second. The trilogy is going to make for a great movie!
B0084AXZK0|3.0|The middle of the story is very boring.  But if you can get past that, the end of the book is worth it.  We rented Dorian Gray with Ben Barnes and Colin Firth.  It is loosely based on the book.  I like the book better.  There are several movies out about the book.  I am going to watch all of them and see how closely they parallel the book.  That's how intriguing I find this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it! itbis so ouch easier to look on pinterest with this app on ky kindle than with the web.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So, I know that people compare this series to 50 shads of grey, and I get the similarities, but they are NOTHING alike.  Day has a wonderful way with writing--and it is truly amazing to read something so beautiful, hot, passionate and deep as these books.  I know the situation is similar to 50 shades, but you don't have to suffer though the poor writing style with this series!  (and I really enjoyed the 50 shades series).  So take my word for it, this is a beautiful love story, with hot passion and deeply developed (and perfectly written) characters.  READ IT!!!! Hot sex, deep love, messed up people finding each other and working through difficult situations, it is wonderful, and Day does an amazing job of telling the story, and making you feel for it.  So many tears while reading these books, do not miss them.  Such incredible talent and a modern day pride and prejudice.  Eva and Gideon are Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  Love love love!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I always loved Ken Follet and he doesn't disappoint this time around.  From the first page one is deeply involved in many lives.  It is a continuation of Giants of the Earth-- but you don't have to read that to follow this book.  It is indeed a beautifully written historical novel and I am sad to be finishing it!

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games was filled with things from the past and the future mixed together. I think that the book could be realistic and could actually happen somewhere in the world. I think the way that they treated the games was kind of how we treat the Olympics. Except for the fact that the people that compete in the Olympics aren't trying to kill each other. The author did a good job of making it seem like it was reality. The way the author incorporated the romance between Katniss and Peeta was perfect. She wanted us to know that all the people didn't hate each other, that they could be somewhat normal teenagers. The only part I found a little bit confusing is how the author started the book. It took me a while to get in to reading. Once I got into the book, I couldn't put it down. This book was an amazing book that will keep you hooked for the whole trilogy. i would rate this book a 9 out of 10. I recommend buying this book.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This show is phenomenal! It has everything; drama, comedy, romance, with a gorgeous cast and fantastic writing and this is an amazing season! If you are a fan of the show, the special features alone are worth the price! Audio Commentary on Cuffed & The Blue Butterfly, Bloopers, The making of the underwater car scene in Pandora/Linchpin, and Molly Quinn & Nathan Fillion do The Thrilling Adventure Hour. Plus, as any Castle fan knows, you can never watch the season finale, Always, too many times. Amazing cast includes: Stana Katic, Nathan Fillion, Jon Huertas, Seamus Dever, Molly Quinn, Susan Sullivan, Tamala Jones, & Penny Johnson Jerald. Well worth the price!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|So as not to mislead anyone my five star rating is for the movie itself. Anyone familiar with this movie already knows how great it is so I am not about to review it.  As for the disk itself why is the movie on both sides?  Maybe I'm just being picky here buy why do I have to flip the disk over to see side two? My fault for not noticing that when I placed the order but still these days no movies come loaded on both sides of a disk. As for the format it's widescreen only and not the best of image quality. I'm actually thinking of ordering another copy only this time being more careful to read how this movie is formatted and that it's on one side of the disk only.
0316228532|5.0|The book is not for the non-serious reader, nor is it a book for simple entertainment.<br />I read it in about 3 days and have started over again.<br />I find it has many of the things in it that made me love Harry Potter - a heart for the outcast, for one.<br />Rowling creates characters in a way matched by only one or two authors known to me. We come to care for even the ones who are less attractive, less kind (Terri, Miles). Only a very few are flat on the page (Maureen, Howard, Obbo).<br />Her use of symbols is noticeable but not heavy-handed.  Rivers, bridges, walls. Stolen things. Lost children, young and old.<br /><br />Ms. Rowling helps us examine ourselves, as well as our capacity for compassion and inclusiveness, without accusing us in what we already know are our failings.<br /><br />I will read this book many times.

0767817478|4.0|I am a hardcore G fan, so I can understand how my fellow Godzilla fans hate on this movie. I think most people are scared of the change this movie brought to the big guy. The effects are amazing, theres no arguing about that, it may nmt be our cup of tea but it is definitly a cool movie, and I overally like it.

B004Q9T4E4|3.0|The hypothesis on 6 killer apps is good. The defence for these in terms of relevant facts or logical reasoning is however inadequate, making some of the \\"apps\\" not explained. The book jumps very often into glorification of religion without logically explaining correlation to \\"work\\".
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I stayed up until 1:30 am to finish the book in one day. It was a great follow-up to part one.  For all the 50 shades fans (myself included) this was a little faster and the dynamics between the two were similiar but I'd say Eva and Gideon won out slightly.  No need for a part three!!!!  I liked the way part 2 ended.  However, if a part 3 comes out, I'll get it!!!!!!  Definitely worth reading, esp if you read part one.......
0525478817|5.0|Powerful. Moving. Touching. Those are the first three words that come to mind when I think about 'The Fault In Our Stars'. This book has moved me deeply, and I hope that everyone gets to read this book, at least once in their lives. As a 27 year old that does not have much time to read books, I am so glad that this was one that caught my eye.<br /><br />Thank you, John Green, I'll be reading your other books soon :)
0316228532|1.0|My wife has a rule about dirty jokes... they at least better be funny. If Rowling wishes to write a vulgar book she needs it to be well written and interesting. She struck out on all three.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I wasn't really sure on what to expect with the second round of the Crossfire Series, and I have to say, this book was FANTASTIC!!!  I absolutley loved this one and I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the 3rd one..<br />Gideon was so different in this book and surprisingly.. he really did have is reasons and for what he did, I don't know if that is what drew me into him more or what...  I mean, there is really no boundries to what this man will do for love... Agh, I am just biting at the bit to go into more detail but I don't want to be the one that spoils it for someone else!<br /><br />If you were \\"Ify\\" on the first one because it was so closely related to 50 Shades, then you MUST read this one... it will knock your socks off and not be anything what you think it might be. TRUST ME, READ THIS BOOK!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game. it is fun and reminds me of a real arcade game. Who needs to travel to the arcade when you have this?
B008J9EYFG|4.0|What is known as the Sugaring Season runs in Vermont from around March to mid-April. It is when producers all around the state collect maple sap and boil it down to the sweet sticky syrup. It is the same maple trees that lead to that stunning sweep of colour in the vibrant fall foliage. Beth Orton's new album seems to combines both events. It is very much a hymn to Autumnal and pastoral moods but combined with a lovely bruised fragility which makes this album such a real treat.<br /><br />Gone is all the shimmering electronica and digital files of the dallainces with Andy Weatherall or the Chemical Brothers, indeed the template is much more in tune with her frequent collaborations with Ryan Adams. Following a lengthy hiatus to bring up her daughter this is her first album in six years that firmly sticks to the acoustic knitting and is all the better for it. In that time she built up a considerable backlog of songs and in the selections here has largely chosen wisely. Opener \\"Magpie\\" has a bluesy tint to the essential folk based melancholy. It builds to a big finish as Orton's vocals stretch and the intensity ratchets up. More gentle are the following tracks, the lifting pop of \\"Dawn chorus\\" and the almost Nick Drake sounding guitar backdrop to \\"Candles\\" where Orton's haunting vocals are at their very best. The slow piano ballad laden with violins \\"Something more beautiful\\" is an undoubted highlight and will replay repeated listens. One sour note comes in the form of the Weimar cabaret of \\"See Through Blue\\" where she tries to adopt a Dietrich style loftiness but it all feels rather contrived and breaks the flow of the album. Still it comes in under two minutes and is followed by \\"Last leaves of Autumn\\" which is one of the best things Beth Orton has ever done. This reviewers favourite however is the lovely closing track \\"Mystery\\" a wonderful haunting ballad that echoes the song writing skills of the great Sandy Denny. Orton's chalky voice has never been better employed and as it gently fades out you touch the repeat button and listen in rapture once more. For those wanting more you will wish to note that the deluxe edition also contains three extra tracks namely covers of \\"That Summer Feeling\\" by Jonathan Richman, a nice take on the Carole King standard \\"I Wasn't Born To Follow\\" made famous by the Byrds and a haunting version of Neil Young's \\"Goin Back\\" from the \\"Comes a time\\" album.<br /><br />Orton has admitted in interviews that it was listening to Joni Mitchell's seminal album \\"Blue\\" that provided her musical coming of age. It has served her well since \\"Sugaring Season\\" has echoes of Mitchell, Sandy Denny, Cat Power and a host of others. There is nothing revolutionary or radical about this album but it makes up for this with moving honesty and fine melodies. More than that after six long years it signals a return to form by an artist who has built up an admirable and deserved reputation as a top notch songwriter with an album which will be ranked amongst her best. Its good to have her back.d and as it gently fades out you touch the repeat button and listen in rapture once more.

1423140605|4.0|I love this series and I loved this book.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that it freezes up at 53 percent and no matter what I do, it will not stop.  I'm really frustrated by this.  I have to skip a section in order to keep reading.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|Love this c/d! This music is so varied and keeps me dancing in my seat and in my car. Love the vocals, guitar, drums, horns. Some of it reminds me of New Orleans, some Jamaican, some rock, some blues - great combination.<br />[[ASIN:B002GYS1FO The House That Dirt Built]]

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I fear this films true value won't show until years from now. What with having to follow the  true 2008 best picture The Dark Knight, being lumped in the same genre as the overly silly spectacle that was the overrated Avengers 3D and to top it all the theater massacre. This had a tough hill to climb, but given the films tone it is a huge success. With presidential election, Irans nuclear threat and the attacks in Lybia I believe Rises is the quintessence of themes like conservative or liberal, post 9/11, post Katrina and terrorism. More than a superhero film, the best!

144235948X|5.0|. I loved, loved, and loved this book!!!! I downloaded the pre-view to pass some time hours before the \\"Reflected in You\\" book was released (which I pre ordered and was counting the days for the release). I was so intrigued in the preview I immediately bought the book. What started as a quick 10 p.m. read to pass the time before bed ended up keeping be up until I had to leave for work the next morning at 5:40 a.m.. The book left me mesmerized and unable to put it down. The characters had that Scarlett/ Rhett Butler complex to where the love/ hate relationship keep me begging for more. They were sexy with loads of drama to make them interesting. Many emotions were brought to surface during this read including sadness, excitement, happiness, tears, being scared, disgusted and so many more. This story kept it going with the perfect amounts of drama, love, sex, excitement and dialogue. The romance in the bedroom was lacking but it definitely wasn't over done as it is in some books. There were just enough details not to get old and embarrassed by reading. The scenes were also believable, due to every act of sex not ending in multiple organisms (like with Fifty Shades and Bared to You- common!!). These characters and the storyline were amazing! I cannot wait until his version, although I pre-viewed a chapter on the net and loved it! Jamie you are a great writer and should be very proud of yourself. As much as I like other books I found many gramatical errors and lines written making me wonder if they even had editors to preview before releasing. Hopefully you have a sequel to this series. Do they make it or not? Is she already pregnant, will he end up fighting in Vegas after all, does he suffer the after math of the deadly fire from the fight. How will it affect their love story? Or maybe carried out with Mare's or Shipley's story intertwined with many updates with this couple....I have my fingers closed
B006OOHYIC|3.0|I would have gladly given a 5 star review, until the update deleted all my progress. I've been playing for weeks, and have finished all of the levels. I was 3 away from gold on all the levels.<br /><br />Aside from all that, an amazing game that will really test your creative problem solving abilities.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love Ken Follet, especially his historical novels. A friend recommended his \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\"; I read them and was hooked! I've read everything he's written since then. I'm now on the second book of his 20th Century Trilogy and it has captured me, just as the first book did. It's so enjoyable seeing the historical events unfold through the eyes of several European and American families. I heartily recommend this book--I can't wait to see the third book.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is the highly anticipated squeal to Bared to You. I read and loved the first novel, but I have to say the follow up left me wanting a bit. I am not sure I can really put a finger on what was missing with this installment, but it didn't quite have that same pull that the first one hand. Don't get me wrong Silvia Day has a way of writing that grips you from the beginning and holds on to you until the end and sometimes it doesn't leave your mind until long after you've finished the tale. This book Is no exception, once I started reading I could not put the book down. I was up until 2:30am reading when I knew I had to be up at 6:00am. So needless to say, yet again Silvia Day has made me incredibly tired the next day at work.<br /><br />Once again we are pulled into the rollercoaster ride that is Gideon and Eva's relationship. They are so both emotionally scarred they have no idea on how to treat each other or how to have a functioning relationship.  They are a chaotic mess almost perfect one minute and in the span of the next fighting, the push pull of their relationship is almost too much. Although just when I thought I had enough Ms. Day switches it up so I can't say you ever get bored.  I also, got annoyed with Eva at times I needed a break from her inner monologues and insecurities. I also found her somewhat selfish, it always was about her and what Gideon isn't sharing and rarely focuses on what he is giving. I kind of felt sorry for the guy. I really would have liked Gideon's POV from time to time to get a better glimpse of such an intriguing man and to get a break from Eva.  (very slight spoiler) My one other issue with this book is I saw the ending coming from a mile away, it was not a surprise to me so I have no idea why it was such a surprise to Eva. She is a smart girl; I don't understand how she wasn't putting the sequence of events together. (End of slight spoiler)<br /><br />Ok, so that was what I kind of felt like was wrong with the book and really even those were really minor issues. They only brought my enjoyment of the book down a very slight amount. Overall, I really enjoyed it, and consumed it in one sitting. I enjoy Silvia Day's writing she has a way of pulling you in and create a scene. You have no problems visualizing what she wants you to see. It was so clear to me; I have a clear image in my head of Gideon, Eva, Cary and everything that was going on around them.  The sensuality aspect of this book was off the chain; Gideon and Eva certainly know how to go at it, at times desperate for each other's and others lazier and slow, but first and foremost loving. Their love for each other is clear and never in doubt. They may have issues but loving each other is not one of them.  They scoop you up in their whirlwind and it's an amazing ride.<br /><br />As always the side characters add value to this story. I ADORE Cary and really want him to find some peace. He seemed to find a small measure by the end of the book, but not enough for my peace of mind. I want him to be truly happy! Eva's mother cracks me up, she is so neurotic but you can't help but love her because she has so much love for Eva and Cary both. We meet Eva's dad and he is Eva's rock. These characters never take away from the story and always add to it.ven those were really minor issues. They only brought my enjoyment of the book down a very slight amount.

Their love for each other is clear and never in doubt. They may have issues but loving each other is not one of them.  They scoop you up in their whirlwind and it's an amazing ride.<br /><br />As always the side characters add value to this story. I ADORE Cary and really want him to find some peace. He seemed to find a small measure by the end of the book, but not enough for my peace of mind. I want him to be truly happy! Eva's mother cracks me up, she is so neurotic but you can't help but love her because she has so much love for Eva and Cary both. We meet Eva's dad and he is Eva's rock. These characters never take away from the story and always add to it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|As a huge fan of David Baldacci, I enjoyed this book. Its storyline is well done and as usual the characters seem to come to life. You feel like it a story that you want to be included in the characters.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|liked the game until today. the new update erased all my progress. now back to 1st puzzle. tried to restore data from my backup but no go. I'll be reverting back to previous version! please fix this!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Most Reacher fans have reacted negatively to this book, and I can't say I blame them.<br /><br />The plot really is a stretch.  Since unraveling the mystery is a good part of what the reader enjoys when picking up books in this genre, having Middle Eastern conspiracy hiding amidst the corn fields of the Midwest is a disappointment.<br /><br />The geography is too complex: the characters simply are spending too much of the action driving back and forth, and we're treated to way too much discussion about the intricate patterns of farm roads.<br /><br />The dialogue, as usual, is good.  The opening scenes are well-written and build the tension of the story.  But the tension dissipates, and at a certain point I was reading just to get to the end.  Like Reacher, I became really more interested in traveling on to Virginia.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can't stop playing this game! It is so realistic and so addictive trying to get the special coins and prizes.
B008QE9VJI|2.0|This retelling of the original Dark Shadows story line had such potential....but<br />the film fails, with it's tired comedic approach.  The story elements from the original,<br />a gothic, brooding, horror melodrama freshly coined, have been ransacked for their superficial<br />characteristics and poured into this average 'comedic', 'up-to-date' mold, which in the end<br />is a tired, unimaginative bore..in spite of blockbuster budget, cast and production design.<br />Promoted as a relative of the original, the creator missed the mark entirely and In the creators, IMO,<br />stupidity, they failed to take the story seriously in their approach...which is what made<br />the original, as well the Hammer Films of the UK, so effective.  Whatever audience this film found<br />will not be the ones that made the original endure and endear with all it's charming qualities..<br />this version has been sanitized of all it's ancestor's imaginative delights, and the tougue so firmly<br />planted in this films' cheek, quickly dislodged and choked it.  I'm sure there are some<br />who managed to enjoy this, but personally regret spending the $20.00 for it at Wal-Mart.<br />More than ever, can't wait for \\"House of Dark Shadows\\" to be released end of the month,<br />to wipe away the memory of this unmemorable effort.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I watched the first season of \\"The Walking Dead\\" on Netflix, having heard and read many good reviews of the program.  While not an aficionado of the Zombie motif in general, I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys good drama, who appreciates well written plots and story telling.  After renting these, I felt that I would enjoy watching each episode multiple times, as there is enough character development and plot twist to make this a worthwhile purchase.  Other reviews will take up the story line (survivors of a deadly zombie virus) and there are some wonderful points made throughout them, if you are curious or not sure about this series, please read through them and take a chance.  Warning:  these have a high \\"ick\\" factor, so the program is not for those of weak stomach.  This series can turn even a non-fan of zombies into a fan.  Yes, it's that good.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The writing appears stilted. The characters are stick figures. However, the research on this period of time, the leading up to and actual events and subsequent events after World War 11, is done well.
1423140605|5.0|I finished this book and it was most certainly the best of the three in the series, a lot of drama, action, and Percy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire a couple of weeks ago and now I'm obsessed with Pinterest!!! The app works great so I think any problems written about in earlier reviews have been resolved (?)
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I have enjoyed several of Michael Connelly's novels and this was one the best.  There were so many surprises that I could not put it down until I finished it.  Do you want surprises?  This book is for you.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was really long and I enjoyed all the twists and turns in it.  Please hurry with the sequel!  It made for some enjoyable hours trying to figure it all out before it led me to the answer.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am 90% finished and have the same good feelings  for the second of the Century trilogy as I had for the first-\\"Fall of the Giants.\\" I do think it slows down at the very end-just like the first book. However, I have loved reading it and am anxiously awaiting the 3rd and last book of the series.
B00846REIS|5.0|I just read this book for the 2nd time to get ready for Reflected in You.  OMG!!!  I love Gideon.  Slyvia Day's writing is completely amazing.  I loved the story, the characters everything about this book.  A definate must read.
0061120073|5.0|This book popped up on some kind of must-read list recently, which I thought was a little odd. All I knew about this book was there was a movie version, which I vaguely remembered seeing part of on TV as a child. I got the book from the library and was immediately entranced. This story of a bright, sensitive child growing up poor in Brooklyn in the early 1900s is also a story about family, the strength of women and the value of love, hard work and education.<br /><br />This book is so honest about the weaknesses and flaws of its characters as well as their good points. In addition to the story, which draws you along to see what happens next, you learn what it was like to grow up in this hardscrabble environment and in this time. But it's not like a boring history lesson, but a fascinating feeling of being \\"in it\\" and exactly what it was like to live on pennies a day. I was worried it would be sentimental, but it's just the opposite.<br /><br />From reading the material that came with my copy, apparently this book started out as autobiography and the author was persuaded to fictionalize it. Perhaps this is why it is so heartfelt. It was also marketed as for adults, but it could be read by 14 and up in my opinion (there is some adult subject matter, but it's only dealt with on the level of a child's understanding.)<br /><br />This is one of those books where you're gulping it down while at the same time wishing it would never end. There are so many parts I related to as a wife, mother and daughter--it's timeless, while being very \\"of a time.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps the best compliment I can give is that this book made as huge an impact on me as Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books. I can't believe I never read it before, and if you haven't, you need to!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been waiting forever for a Pinterest app for the Kindle and now that it's finally here, I absolutely love it! took them forever to get it though!
B002NWOOXW|5.0|Second part of the Bridget Jones series - just lovely! Liked the extras, too. Wouldn't it be fun if there was a third movie - both married, kids running wild and Bridget trying to cope? I would love to see that!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|was having trouble with Google maps always starting on it's own and getting a major battery drain and couldn't figure out why, until I deleted this crappy app!  Even using developers ability to force close/kill , it turns itself right back on and opens Google maps to try and get your location.  Now I just use the mobile version of the website.  Same service with none of the problems!!
B008QE9XD2|1.0|This movie was nothing more than a farce. It was definitely NOT Dark Shadows. The crap put into this would have been better served if used in a remake of \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\".  It really felt more like I was watching \\"Occupy Collinwood\\"...There is a huge problem with the scriptwriting here.  In both the original and the Revival series, Angelique wanted Barnabas in order to rise above her station in life. She was a servant, and he was upper crust...In those days the two classes did NOT intermarry.  To gain control she cursed him with her dying breath and made him a vampire (IN THE REAL ONE).  In this one, she doesn't get killed and curses him--she curses him, has him buried alive by an angry mob.<br /><br />She then takes over Collinsport and destroys the family business--and livlihood--for the most part.  NOW here is the problem with this script: IF she is already running Collinsport, what in the heck does she need Barnabas for?  She does not love him as much as she wants to own him...Sorry but this movie is trash--pure and simple. IF you loved the original don't waste your $.  You only see the original cast members for the time it takes to blink anyhow. I kid you not!
B0076NKNLA|2.0|The movie was a good platform for Michelle Williams to stretch herself to be Marilyn. She did a pretty good job. However, Kenneth Branagh as Laurence Olivier wasn't believable, except for the voice. There was nothing about Marilyn in this movie that I didn't already know, as I was waiting for some BIG moment. It never came. There was no point to this movie being made, so there's no point going further.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Awesome app. Reliable even down to the weekly forecast. Love it! It makes it very easy to plan my week...activity-wise or how if I need any special clothes like a raincoats or an extra jacket. The app makes getting the weather simple and also includes some neat extra info about humidity etc. Very helpful.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series, I can relate in a lot of ways. I was frustrated with this book at the end for two reasons 1 I hated that I didn't have more to read! and 2 that I have to wait for the 3rd book now. Its going to be hard to wait for the 3rd book, I cant wait!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book.  Lots of sex and good story line.  I like the first book so much, I immediately bought the second one.
B00684J49U|5.0|No problems with the discs, they arrived in a timely fashion.  It's a great show.  I have nothing more to say but have to write more words.  How stupid is that!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD was great!! I was a bit scared at first because some of the things are hard. But, I pushed through and I can tell the transformation in my body. It's a great work out!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent book. Best I've read so far by Ken Follett. Can't wait for the third trilogy. His characters are as real as I was reading. Excellent look at the times duirng World War II and the compact he had on all the families, wether rich or poor. Great insight that all that took place.
B009ANP4F4|4.0|The movie is a must see! I loved all the dance scenes, definitly not what I expected. Seen all other step up movies and thought nothing can beat the first one or Channing. Male dancer did a great job acting and dancing. Male dancing did not need a step in for tuff moves, he did it all!! I'd like to see him battle Channing in a future movie. The only downfall I had was the love connection wasn't there. Definitly attraction but not love. I still give it a four, being this is a dance movie. I'm just a sucker for a love story! Overall great job! Hope there is a part 5
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Never ceased to disappointment me, love action mystery and romance! i couldn't put the book down! its something every woman wants!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was great! It is a classic. Everyone who reads it will love it!You need to read this book!
B0093H8HXS|5.0|This cpu is great for the price.  I've read that it outperforms amd fx quad cores that run at 4.2ghz.  I was building a $700 budget pc that i wanted to be able to play games with and upgrade down the road.  So i went with this over an amd because the performance is better at the price point, and it is the lga 1155 socket which means i can grab an i5 or i7 whenever i want and drop it in my system.  Also, this is an ivy bridge chip for about $5 more than an i3 2120.  All in all i'm very happy with my purchase.  Oh and i almost forgot, temperatures.  My case is the haf 912 with a 200mm intake and a 120mm and 200mm exhaust.  This cpu idles at 34 celcius on the STOCK cooler, and it reaches about 44 celcius when i play games, again i do have very good airflow in my case.  However, if your looking at the $100 to $130 price range for a cpu, get this and you will not regret it.
030758836X|4.0|Book was well written and had some interesting twists and plot lines.  Well thought out and executed.  Kept me intrigued and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />-D.C. Renee (author of More Than Enough)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a very addictive game!! I quite enjoy wasting time playing it!!! It is likethe Chunk n Cheese game without loosing all your money!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The book overall was okay. We finally see what happens to the man that raped her countlessly. The one thing that I enjoyed was when we found out what was wrong with him. I enjoyed when they were at the concert and when Brett wrote that song about her. However, I hated when she always doubts his loyalty and questions him being faithful
B00932HEX2|5.0|I have always liked Damian Lewis in anything he has done. As Soames Forsythe in the Forsythe Saga and I loved him as Charlie Crews in Life.  Homeland shows again how versatile an actor he is and the story makes you want to see the next episode.  Hope to watch it to the end of the series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|[[ASIN:1451627297 11/22/63: A Novel]][[ASIN:B005K0HDGE 11/22/63]]<br />Couldn't believe Stephen King picked such a controversial subject matter. Actually this makes perfect sense only SK could twist you and turn you with another tale that I hated to put down. Too big to hold and read, so I wrapped it up and stored it; then bought the Kindle edition. Couldn't put it down! It traveled everywhere with me. Hope to reread it in a few months. Thank you SK!!!
B007S3S8HO|2.0|In a nutshell this is Angry birds meets LEGO meet KNEX-<br />While it looks cool this ended up being very frustrating for my 5 year old son to play and for me to put together.<br />He was crying within 5 minutes of playing BOTH time he sat to play.  He was not able to fix his issue himself easily and was begging for help.<br />Knex tried to make this so it is easy to fall apart when you play, unfortunately the blocks themselves are NOT easy to assemble.  The connections between bricks are too flimsy.<br />WE have done MANY Lego Sets and not had individual pieces even pop apart this easy.  Nor has my son been upset with playing with them.<br />On the plus side The birds and pigs are very well made and cute!  I also think how the the \\"slingshot\\" works to shoot the birds is a great idea. unfortunately as a whole the set is not appealing.  You can buy board games of angry birds that you build and knock down that is just the same fun factor without the frustration.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Funny, poignant. Easy to suspend my disbelief. I doubt I would have read except from curiosity, famousest author goes feral, etc, ... But I am glad I did. Slightly weirded out by the pride and prejudice echoes in the first few chapters. Then the trainspotting parts kinda took over.<br /><br />In the end, though, surprisingly optimistic about the miraculous elasticity of the human heart and mind and spirit (to the extent that those are different things.) Comedy not tragedy, despite the unlikely trappings. Even, in a strange way, heartening.

B007SGM084|2.0|How this book got to be a best seller is beyond me.  Buying and reading this book was a waste of time and money.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|Quite enjoyed watching this movie but disappointed that all the ironic humour was taken out of it.  Also the changed ending spoilt it for me.  But acting was good and scenery was beautiful.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Will drain your patience, your time, AND your wallet because you (or your child)  can purchase coins in multiples. You can earn points very slowly while offline, slightly faster while online, and turtle slow while playing.  Three stars for realism. A removal from my device for being a drain on the pocketbook.
B0095R64AO|1.0|I rented this movie because I was in need of a laugh, but was very disappointed, the movie wasn't funny at all.  :-(
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was brilliantly written. I was so upset when it ended. I beautiful ending. It draws you in you become part of the book.
034580404X|5.0|You cannot put the Fifty Shades trilogy books down.  I catch myself coming in from work and setting down to read just for awhile and its past my bedtime before I can put them down.  Excellent diet plan -you don't take the time away from them to cook or eat for wanting to see what is going to happen next.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a page turner. After hearing so much about it, I decided to read it for myself. I enjoyed the book as it really is about a relationship and the psychology of the characters and not just sex. Also, I didn't think the sex was as horrific as critics would make one think.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|The acting is superv. It holds your attention and delivers an outstanding product. Each episode leads to better and better material concerning the club and its members and family.
6305428220|4.0|I have never seen a movie of the purely entertainment genre that is so packed with instantly recognizable faces.  Even Daily Show host John Stewart has a major role as a student-favorite science teacher.  There is also singing superstar Usher, Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Danny Masterson of That 70's Show, Clea DuVall of But I'm a Cheerleader, Salma Hayek, and more.  It's insane.<br /><br />The movie itself is scary, well-paced, humorous, contains fine special effects and a fully orchestrated soundtrack.  The Faculty is a treat - don't miss it if you are any kind of horror buff, or you have a favorite actor in this list ... or just a vendetta against a former teacher.  Wink.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|Have waited months for her new release, what a disappoint. Love her traditional jazz stuff of old, but this new one loses me big time. I just dont see the talent were used too in this new CD. I will join the chorus of rating it as 2 stars. Figured there might be a reason why she posed in such revealing attire, the music cant stand on its own. :(
B001JI5DRC|4.0|Apollo 13 does a good job of recreating what life was like in 60's America. The story is based on a real event and keeps viewers attention not simply on will the crew make it back home to earth but on the efforts of the hundreds of people who helped prove why there is still hope that people and life are more important than what most likely would be today's media concern for who's at fault for an equipment failure. A great film for the whole family.
0393330435|5.0|I am not the biographical type. I've probably read maybe two in my life - this being one. With that said, this book is seriously awesome. Sure, it's chock full of tech speak and over-the-top TMI, but in all that you get a glimpse of the real Woz. And he's so totally cool. Like that favorite uncle you only get to see once a year at your family's 4th of July reunion. He brings all the illegal fireworks. Yeah, that uncle.<br /><br />Woz writes his story in a way that let's the reader into his life without being too intrusive. So you don't get that voyeuristic guilty sensation. He takes you on a journey of his own genius without being aware of it himself. His stories were often so clever or amusing I followed my husband around reading them again out loud.<br /><br />So I totally recommend any fan of any genre to pick this one up.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I wasn't sure whether to give this book one star or five stars. I don't normally cry when I read books, but Rowling has made me cry three times. I cried when Dobby died. I cried when Harry went into the forest to meet Voldemort and die. And I cried at the tragic, heart-breaking ending to this book.<br /><br />If you are looking for Harry Potter, this isn't it. The language is coarse and the sexuality is explicit. The themes are dark and disturbing and not for children.<br /><br />The book is intense and engaging. The characters are well-drawn, real, believable, and exquisitely written, but every single character is flawed. Most of them are not likeable. There is no clear protagonist. The closest character to a protagonist dies at the end of the prologue and you can't help but think the tragic ending wouldn't have happened if he had lived.<br /><br />At the end of Harry Potter, good wins. Love and friendship and loyalty are stronger than hate. In The Casual Vacancy, evil wins in a split decision. You sense that some of the characters have been, or at least can be, redeemed - that they can go forward stronger and better. However, most of the characters seem just as self-absorbed as they were when we met them. The climatic tragedy is completely avoidable and could have been prevented by so many different characters. I suppose that is the message that Rowling wants to convey; that tragedy happens all around us that could be prevented if we looked beyond ourselves.<br /><br />I've read the Harry Potter books multiple times and I will read them again. I doubt that I will read this book again, but it is worth reading once.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Loved the book (and I'm a 30-something). I was angry at the way the book ended. All I can say is it's going to be a long year to wait for the next book!
B005FITIF0|5.0|I only watched this on Netflix just for the hell of it.  One word?  WOW!!!! Thats all I could think of after the movie was over.<br />I was going to only watch part of this as I had plans to go eat somewhere before the place closed.  I ended up cancelling the plans as I couldn't leave the TV.<br />Its mind boggling how this didn't get more publicity.  I watched Hunger Games last night and its mind boggling how that movie got so much hype.  Butler did a great job in this movie.  Not sure how they could of made this movie any better.  After watching this, I thought, maybe it was just me that thought this was a great movie, since the lack of publicity.  So I came here to Amazon to see what others thought, and I relieved to see that I wasn't the only one that liked this.<br />This movie will open your eyes, and make you think.  You'll love this movie, and a great movie to share with friends or family.  I'd say its one of those movies thats great to rent, but even better to buy and have in your collection.<br />Well done!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book is good, 1st erotica book with a story line in it I ever read, I'll be buying books 2 & 3 to get the whole story.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Ghost Protocol is another in the series of U.S. government covert action films proving why Hollywood loves a villain. In this film, everyone we meet cannot be trusted, even the good guys. If explosions, mixed martial arts fighting and fast cars keep you on the edge of your movie seat, then this film is for you.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have not finished yet, at the time when writing this..but it is surely a Follet. In my opinion is as enjoyable as Fall of Giants and others (Pillars of the earth, World without end and Man from St Petersburg)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. I laughed, I cried...It's awesome.
1426308469|5.0|National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Dinosaurs from (National Geographic)  really nice book my Child is very Happy with this book even I enjoyed it
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I was looking forward to the next story as I am a big fan.  The story line appeared very rushed and not well thought out like the usual story line.  I know that there are some far fetched parts in these books but this latest edition took it a little too far.  A dissapointing read.  I would have preferred to wait a few more months so that a bit more thought was put into the book.  Sorry but this one lets the rest of the series down.  If you have not read any Reacher stories, dont read this first!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Enjoyed the Firefly series on DVD, too bad that I missed it when it was on TV. That might have helped it stay on the Tube. The movie tied up a few of the loose ends from the abreviated series. I would have enjoyed following up on some of the characters back stories a little more. Fun movie by the director of the \\"Avengers\\".
B008LY5VHE|5.0|There are few movies that truly stand the test of time. Jaws is one of them. No matter how many times you have watched this movie, the story, cast and director pull you back into the water and remind you that the next time you go to the ocean beach, be very afraid! As far as movies go, it doesn't get much better than this! Oh, the Blu-Ray picture and sound are fantastic! Surfs up!
0525953728|5.0|Very interesting book and well written, my whole family is reading it from 16 year old son to 80 year old grandmother!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|a wonderful game to have when ur bored. its better then the fame's at the fair cuz there is no real money involved.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Not sure what it is about Gideon but I do like him more then Christain Grey. I like the first book but I have to say I did enjoy this one a little more. Eva got her fright back in this book and she starting taking back her life and asking question and not sitting in self pity. She is hurt but she gets back up and firghts and does not let her low self esteem pull her down. These Character develop in big ways in this book, looking forward to see what happens with Gideon and Eva!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is very practical and a quick way to apply God's word every day in our busy lives! loved it!!
B0030IIYYS|4.0|This is a rare movie series in which I think the middle movie is actually better, just a little bit mind you, than the first and last. I thought it was very clever to bring the \\"Antiques Roadshow\\" world of toy collectibles into the story of a boy and his beloved toys. I loved the \\"Cleaner\\" who renovated Woody for Al, the ethically-challenged collector. For more plot details you can read many other reviews here; my main complaint with this edition is that the lovely live-action music video that was packaged in my old VHS video cassette version is absent. It showed the real cowboy band performing an extended version of \\"Woody's Round Up\\" on stage. I really miss that.  The extras that ARE included on the DVD are cute animated profiles of the artists who made the animation come to life and I like them, but that music video should be in there. On back of the package it lists the Extras, and it says \\"and more...\\" so I thought for sure that performance would be the \\"more\\" part.  Listings on Amazon should be more detailed to show absolutely everything that is on the disc. So now I gotta keep both the DVD and the VHS tape- darn!
0380807343|5.0|My Review:  This is a story filled with fantasy and twisted imaginations. If you love fantasy you will love reading Coraline (not Caroline). When Coraline and her parents moved into a new house she couldn't wait to explore her surrounding. She was interested in looking for the well Miss Spink and Miss Forcible told her to keep away from.  Coraline spent her first two weeks exploring the garden and the grounds. While exploring inside the house she came across a door that leads to a different world that looks familiar.<br /><br />Everything looks like her world but not exactly the same. Her other mother and father has buttons for eyes and looks creepy. She notices everything seems to be better in that world, until the other mother plan to make her look like them.<br />Coraline realizes that this alternative world really isn't a good place to live in.<br /><br />What a great story, with interesting characters that catches your attention from the start to finish. This anniversary edition features a new foreword by the author, a reader's guide and author Q & A. I highly recommend this book not only for kids but for adults.<br /><br />Disclaimer: As per FTC guidelines, I received a copy of this book from Harper Collins Publishers in exchange for my honest review.

B009329ZF2|2.0|I can understand why this movie did not remain in theaters long.  It had some excitement, but not enough to sustain my interest and it was a little silly in parts.  But with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday afternoon, it may be just the thing.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun game that i use to pass time. I'm a fan of the show and I love the audio to this game.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This Colorful and complicated Physics game is a real JEWEL just like Where's My Water.  It is slightly different but very engaging and addictive.  The Graphics, Sounds and game play are flawless on Xoom Tablet.  I love the Variety and complexity of the challenges and the very CUTE and Colorful graphics add to the fun.  Very SMOOTH and Fluid function.  WELL DONE! Well worth the price and I highly recommend it for all ages.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Easy to learn but still challenging. At least as good as Angry Birds!  Waiting on more levels to be released.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very fun game. I got it for my son but ended up playing it more than him. Really cool game
0307948110|4.0|This book , as many of Harris' book s has a very intricate plot. You wonder where the story is taking you. But just hang in there and you will be amp;y rewarded. I loved the book.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is so much more than a super hero action film, although there's plenty of that! I don't want to give any spoilers, so ill just sum up. This is my husbands type of movie. Last night he talked me into watching it with him, I am so glad. It is unexpectedly a great story, not just a bunch of fighting, and crashing, and senseless violence. The special effects dazzle me, how do they make it look so real??? I am a fan of Thor, Ironman, Captain America, and the Hulk now. I can't wait to see what I've been missing! I figured(as did everyone else) that Loki would be returning for more mayhem in something, without giving thing away, he returns here with his vengeful glory seeking temper pitting hero against hero, friend against friend and brother against brother. I was on the edge of my seat shouting at the tv for half the movie the rest was spent in \\" omg!!!\\" And laughter. Yes laughter. So unexpected at the time with hilarious antics. The hulk really does a number on Loki. I just can't say enough good. So I'll end with it is a must see!!! Before I give too much away.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think its a good game because you can play it short, and it keeps your interest. It's also great for kids.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love using Pinterest.  It has changed my life.  I have found more information, ideas, eye-openers, etc. by using Pinterest.  I recommend it to everyone I know (and quote from my finds daily)!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I liked how fast I was able to find music I wanted and download it and have it available to me.  Great app
B002SSBD6W|4.0|I needed a booster to help me visualize what I know is hidden behind the scenes. This book gave excellent depictions of where the food comes from, what the animals' reality is prior to becoming an object for consumption... And equips you to make a more educated decision on what you choose to ingest for sake of Taste vs. Health vs. Tradition vs. Values
0385742886|2.0|The writing in this book was very drab and predictable; nothing like the other 3 books.  I struggled with the stilted dialogue, cliche characters, and repetitive action. It just seems to repeat the same struggle over and over without much variation.<br /><br />Could have done without reading it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Okay...Reflected in You was not what I expected. To much filler and not enough story. Don't get my wrong I gave the book 4 stars because it was just enough to make me read the last book. But I really got upset. Because Bared to you was really awesome it stood on its on. No comparison to 50 Shades of Grey, because the characters in this story are more mature. But the writer never goes back to their conversation about Dominant/Submissive relationship.(REAL LET DOWN) The beginning starts were the last story ends, filler up until mother sees a person from Evas past... that was over half the book. Then filler until Brett comes in the story. The last 60% is were the story is great. I really hope the last book is longer and more indept to cover what was missed in this book. I also, hope that Eva and Gideon has a happy ending in their relationship.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Season two blows season one away. I don't know if they increased the budget or what. My whole family just stayed glued to the screen. We are zombie junkies and there seem to be way more zombies this season. Also, there have never been better zombies in any movie ever. These are very well done, except the one in the well. I think they were going for the swollen look but it wasn't really an improvement. Acting was solid and the pairings of men and women are making lots of sense. The bar scene is one of the most intense so far and it wasn't even about zombies. I hope they get a couple more seasons made before they decide to cut budget or simply mess it up with bad ideas. Everyone I know is talking about this series and giving rave reviews. Just an unexpected and incredible series. Keep it up.
1934030597|5.0|great guide<br />helped me renovate my bicycle completely .<br />a bit to much about wheels building, but built very smart and simple to use even for stupids like me :)
B001EC3JME|1.0|I have been using this for 3 days now at work, and it fits my Coast HP7 flashlight very well. It's a little snug, but has loosened up a little making it easier to place the flashlight back into it fairly easily. It seems to hold the light very securely.  My only complaint is that the swivel on the belt clip could be a little tighter so it doesn't turn when I place the light back into the holster.<br /><br />UPDATE: 10/31/12<br /><br />  After using this for the past few weeks, the elastic has stretched to the point that my light slides almost all of the way out the bottom. My light is a Coast HP7. It's only @ 1\\" in diameter, not big enough to be stretching this bad.  I stopped using it yesterday, and am looking for a better quality replacement.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was one of the best books i have read in a while. I can't wait til the movie comes out
B008G12ERC|5.0|At the first listen I thought this album was absolute crap and felt extremely disappointed by my favorite band. However, the more I listened to this album, the more I liked it. I have to say that this Muse's most different album(even Bellamy said it would be) and is FAR better than The Resistance.<br /><br />1 - Supremecy - totally bad-ass start to the album featuring plenty of Bellamy's falsetto which has been badly missing in previous songs - 9/10<br />2 - Madness - I didn't like the electronic aspect of the song at first but after several listens I think it's a very good song that fits the album well. Definitely the most radio friendly song on the radio, which is probably the reason it is the first single off the album. 8/10<br />3 - Panic Station - the first few seconds I thought I am listening to \\"Another One Bites the Dust,\\" but the song is very unique to Muse's sound. Great song overall. 9/10<br />4 + 5 - Prelude and Survival - despite the cheesy lyrics, instrumentally this might be one of their best songs. 10/10<br />6 - Follow Me - Didn't expect to hear another electronic song on the album. The song is definitely well put together and is a great for sing-along while driving to work. 9/10<br />7 - Animals - the most Muse-ish song so on the album. Nothing special honestly but it is a good song nevertheless. 8/10<br />8 - Explorers - mellow and relaxed song with great lyrics. 9/10<br />9 - Big Freeze - starts very U2-ish but ends strong and is my second favorite song on the album - 10/10<br />10 + 11 - Save Me & Liquid State - While I do appreciate Chris' effort, I find his songs to be very dull which have nothing that stands out about them. His songs also feel out of place on this album, especially Liquid State. 7/10<br />12 + 13 - The 2nd Law Unsustainable & Isolated System - very nice closing to the album. I really like the dubstep in Unsustainable. If there's one thing I learned is that the economy based on endless growth is UNSUSTAINABLE.  9/10<br /><br />Great album in overall. I was first scared by Mandess but after going through the album my fears are gone. It's a terrific piece of work.<br /><br />Here is the way I rank Muse's album at this point:<br />1) Origin of Symmetry<br />2) Black Holes & Revelations<br />3) Absolution (I could argue it being #2)<br />4) The 2nd Law<br />5) Showbiz<br />6) The Resistance
0307591549|5.0|This book harnesses those incredible human resource positive powers that lead to innovation, creativity, high performance and happiness. Wow!!! I would recommend this book to all Leaders as a basis for motivating and building a high performance environment.

0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day is an interesting insight of one of the \\"toughest\\" and most highly trained branches of our military.  The lengths they must go too in training and preparedness for their missions.  It is written in a style that while detailed in military acronyms allows the reader to feel a part of the group. A first hand, solid narrative by one who was there and doesn't make a grandstand statement that he was the hero.<br /><br />The writer adequately \\"skirts\\" divulging detailed Classified military intelligence without compromising security for the sake of telling a tale.<br /><br />The author shared much of what it took to rid the world of a villain who in the end proved that most despots are cowards that manipulate their follows to perform the deeds they don't have the willingness to perform.<br /><br />A good read, by no means a literary classic, but a good solid read of our nations heroes.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I approached this book with my usual enthusiasm for Lee Child books, ready for another Reacher adventure. I came away with the same uneasy feeling that I have knowing that Tom Cruise has been cast to play him. Tom's a good action actor and I do like his movies but somehow he just doesn't quite fit for Reacher, perhaps it's because he's a midget and just doesn't have the physical presence that is written into all the books.<br /><br />This is the first of Lee Child's books that has taken me more than a weekend to read. I've read all the rest, this just seemed to drag on until the end then it was all over in a few pages.<br /><br />I'll still buy his next book and go see the movie but this just seems like it needed a few more Reacherism and a bit more editing.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|As usual, Rush comes through with yet another great musical compilation. I have never been let down by the ever talented trio of Canada. I had waited what seemed like ages of anticipation for this newest album after hearing 2 songs from it at the Red Rocks (Denver) Time Machine Tour show of 2009. Excellent as always!
0525953728|3.0|I was surprised to notice the Book covered areas that would have little interest to the readers reason for purchasing the Book
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much . I bought it because I read everything Mitch writes, not sure of what it was about. Very pleasantly surprised.<br />Good job once again Mitch!

0525953728|5.0|This was my first purchase through Amazon. I aquired 2 copies of \\"No Easy Day\\"-Mark Owen.<br />This is a book I had heard much about and I wanted a copy as soon as it was released, also I wanted a copy for a birthday gift for a good mate.<br />The books arrived in perfect condition even after there journey from USA-Australia.<br />They also arrived on the exact forcasted date witch I was quite impressed with.<br />All in all I was very impressd with the product, product condition, delivery and price.<br /><br />Happy customer..  :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just downloaded the App, so don't have much experience with it, but it was easy to download and to set up with my locations.  I like the look and feel.  I'm using the free app before I commit to purchasing the upgrade version.  I want to see what it does during the cold and snow here in Colorado.
B0086700CM|5.0|a truely great game for killing time without making you want to sling your kindle fire across the room. I'm addicted
0896898288|5.0|The book,\\"The Farmer's Wife Sampler Quilt\\" book and CD are great.  They came in great condition and without delay.  I love reading the individual stories and seeing the quilt blocks that go with it.
0525953728|5.0|He loved this book and thought it was insightful, provocative, and told a much needed story about our current administration.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book. It is a love story with adult content. Every womans dream to find a rich romantic guy but there are always obstacles that the characters work through, and the love between them is stronger than all the problems.
B009IJJ712|5.0|Im in all the way!! Great show! Love the writing, the characters, storyline....everything!!! Eagerly anticipating more episodes!! Favorite character is Watson so far but that could change!!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This story is rather disturbing but very good and hard to put down. It was recommended that I read the book without reading the information flap and I have to say I'm glad I did not read it. For the first quarter of the book, I was coming up with my own different scenerios with regard to why what was happening was happening. In fact, before I gave it to my (adult) daughter to read, I taped a piece of paper over the back cover so that she could not read it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this is an awesme book how could anyone give it any less than 4 stars. for those of you who had the problem with not recieving your book after pre-ordering it, when your at the home screen press menu and then press sync and chec for items this will send your book to you. The same thing happened to me and it sent it ght away
B008M0NDOK|3.0|Be warned--you can ONLY use the controller with the games they list, not other (free) game loft games. I got this as a gift and have to figure out if it's worth paying for new games or not.
B00136Q784|5.0|I really wish that this band would have created more albums.  I enjoy the music and especially the use of the guitar as it sounds more like an unplugged version rather then a rant and rave.  This was a good choice for me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it!! All books in trilogy were well written, sensual and erotic and what every female dreams of!!!!!didnt want it to end!
B006Z2XTBY|3.0|Adam Kindred wanders through Chelsea following a job interview.He stumbles upon a quiet Italian restaurant and has the briefest of encounters with Dr Phillip Wang, an immunologist for a middling drug company. On parting, Kindred see the Dr has left behind one of his files.He calls at the Dr's address to return it, and his life forever changes....<br />  This is an entertaining and readable thriller that holds your interest. Set in \\"The dark side of London\\" this certainly hasn't the hard boiled realism of Nelson Algren's Division Street, and Boyds \\"dark side\\" place and characters smack more of read it in books research than realism. Everyone and everything is a middle class take on the real thing and the novel is also a bit PC and box ticking (ethnics-check;gay character-check;prostitute-check)and there is the tendency to use big words when big words aren't necessary (Hemingway used to say he knew all the big words but what do they add when simple words are far more effective) and 'interesting cul de sacs'eg, Vincent Turpin is described as having acropachyderma like WH Auden. Very interesting but of no relevence. I think the hard boiled realists such as Algren would have made great and greater use of the infliction !<br />  This may seem nit picking, but Boyd was once hailed as Britains great literary hope and being 'literary' isn't about big words, reeling off items on an Italian menu or having characters pointlessly suffer obscure ailments. Boyd is just a story teller, and what more do you really need for a book such as 'Ordinary Thunderstorms' which is a great leisure time read.
076115678X|4.0|I gotta say, what she say in the book is definitely educating.-  It will takes me several times before I got use to the method... but Im hoping I'll get my beautiful hair back... right now is thinning so hopefully it will help thicken my hair more
B0087HT36U|5.0|the game is super fun and addicting.I just cant get enough of it and cant wait for the new levels
B0009P42S2|4.0|Good movie,well made,the animation is great,as with one other movie i reviewed,was a gift from a good friend and not a movie I would have considered for my collection,but as I said the animation IS great and if you are a collector of animation(well made) then you can shortlist this as something inexpensive for a gift if asked.Kids will love the movie (atleast the ones here do!).
0525953728|5.0|This was one of the best I have read for some time.  A must read for anyone who wants to know what really happened--not just the White House spin.
0385536828|4.0|McEwan's new book is set in 1972 when a young girl is recruited by MI5 to help find writers who unbeknownst the them will help create works that will support the current views of the government. She is given the dossier of an up and coming novelist, and presents herself to him as working for this elite and noble company, and before long their relationship blossoms and they become lovers. Her life is now a secret and a lie, from her family, her employer, and from the writer, Tom.  McEwan uses his considerable skills to not only tell her story, but also the various stories that Tom is churning out.  And as Serena is left constantly wondering who she should trust, amidst the reality of fact versus fiction both in her life, and on the printed page she so desperately loves, it becomes both funny and  clever to see how the deception will play out.
B00007LTIB|4.0|I'll admit, the vocals can be ridiculous on some of the Yes albums. It kind of puts them in a lesser caste than bands like King Crimson but they are still very talented and the singing is at times really good too.<br /><br />Many of the albums by Yes are pretty fun to listen to, this being one of them. The vocals are pretty good here and they had not yet driven the carriage off the cliff. VERY cool cover art, three long songs full of complex nuance, and we have quite a display of showmanship from the guitarists and keyboardists especially. I like this one and will give it the full recommendation. Kind of whimsical yet complex noodling abounds. I get some Led Zeppelin vibes at times. You really need to be careful with Yes though.
1908117230|5.0|This book is great. I hear people comment that why does the recipes say to leave a small amount of the egg in but not stir and that it must be a typo.it's not a typo. There's a reason for this.<br />When you leave a small portion of the whites unbeaten even to the paste portion (Italian or French methods) the final product gives more of a glossy shine on the cookie which is one of it's famous characteristics. So if you want to learn Macarons than learn from the best.<br />The pictures are beautiful full page pictures of the final product.<br />The recipes are clear and easy. Macarons are a tough cookie for any first timers. I did two classes before I understood the cookie and the two methods Italian and French methods. This books uses both. The choclate is French and others are Italian.<br />Ifyou follow exactly the recipes they are great results. If you want the traditional Macarons this book is great,ifyou want some fancier more adventurous ones than its is it as well. The only bad comment i have is that there's a section of the more adventurous Macarons with some ingredients I d t know to much about and I am advance baker, not 2 year qualified but I know pastry well.<br />It's a stunning book and a must for anyone who loves the chef or the Macarons. It's a wonderful gift or a wonderful recipe book.<br />If you've never baked before or not good sit I would not recommend it since the Macarons is a cookie that you have to know the stages it goes through similar to bread, you can trust bake there's how do you know when it's ready. Still a great book. Also I would recommend it to any food photographers or stylists on knowing that's considered latest. These pictures are stunning simple.<br />I've tied 3 recipes and followed them directly with successful results over and over with the same three.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|I have seen all three seasons of Spartacus.  It is extremely well done.  It is a shame that the producers are cutting the series short.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The best book ever, i finished the book in 2 days , you always want to know whats happening next.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am enjoying reading The Casual Vacancy by J.K. Rowlings. I like the character development -- she is indeed a master and getting inside a character's skin and showing what makes him or her tick. This certainly must capture modern life in a small British community.  I am hardly an expert on that, but, lets face it, J.K. Rowlings certainly is. It matters little, though, where the story is set.<br /><br />The book tells an age-old story of class warfare wherein the \\"haves\\" want to move the \\"have nots\\" off their radar screen and maintain an idyllic world, albeit populated with souls as damaged as those they wish to avoid. This primal fear of \\"the other\\" plays out through the story, and is one all of us must face as well. I can't find a character in this book that I actually like. There are some I pity, and some I shake my head in disgust over. I am savoring this novel, reading it slowly and carefully --not at my usual breakneck speed, which brings me to the point I wish to make. I love the story, I love the character development, but I wish J.K. Rowlings had told her tale in a few less pages. I do find my brain wandering off to the grocery list now and again, and that should not be.<br /><br />I think it is great, though that this writer has moved on after the Harry Potter saga. In the words of one of her characters from that set of books, we can \\"expect great things\\" from J.K. Rowlings. [[ASIN:B007THA4FI The Casual Vacancy]]
B005FMB8X6|5.0|Discipline is a damn great album. Not a weak track on here. From the amazing Elephant talk and the intertwining guitars, which come about often, to Frame by Frame to Thela Hun Ginjeet and beyond you know these guys are onto something great. Belew was an amazing find and his voice is awesome if you ask me. The lyrics are wonderful, something most progressive bands could only dream about, and the whole band seems cohesive and on call for every second of the album. Guitars are AMAZING here and you can see the reason Fripp called upon KC once again to get the groove going after a long hiatus.<br /><br />Of course this is the 40th series and you get MPL Lossless versions in 5.1, 2.0 24/96 for both 30th and 40th releases, rough mixes of the album in 24/48, and other bonus material. I really hope people give Crimson a chance because if you have never heard these guys you are quite honestly missing out on one of the greatest bands to ever pick up an instrument.<br /><br />One problem I have is the color scheme or ink used to make this deluxe. The CDs appear almost pink to me and I really don't like the color as it is pervasive. The actual digi-cover is much more in line with how I would have hoped the discs were colored, a strong maroon suggestive of the original release I bought for the 30th remaster.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|There is a good chance that this is the stupidest game ever made, but I can't stop playing it! Everyone in my house had downloaded it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really didn't think Sylvia could do any better than the first book, but man, did she ever!  This was a steamy, romantic, gut-wrenching emotional roller coaster and I can't wait for the next book!  There were parts where I was just emotionally exhausted.  My husband thought I was crazy -- one minute I was gasping in surprise with my hand over my mouth, then I was giggling, then I was crying.  The plot-twist at the end was a bit far-fetched, if you ask me, but it's fiction.  I try not to take it too seriously.  If you liked the first one -- read this!
B00932H1HG|5.0|This album is very far out self-actualized.  It's remarkable that one band has been able to achieve so much in such a short amount of time.  If you didn't get a chance to see the videos on myanimalhome.net you need to see them live.  The Deluxe Edition is worth it because the DVD is beautiful.<br /><br />This is another Anco album with several songs that are all my favorite.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|I wasn't sure just what to expect after reading reviews here but the price was reasonable for a 3D BD.  Actually it is a quite nice production with very good use of 3D as part of the production but not as a gimmick.  It is understandable why some were put off.  The 3D is used but is not stressed.  I found only two scenes that \\"pop\\" out of the screen (in an overhead shot in the living statue dance when the man lifts the woman into the air and, the end, when the hat hits the book exploding it into flying pieces).  There were some shots in which it seemed that the action was intentionally kept within the frame of the image.  The performances were not filmed on astage/arena with most using little or no rigging.  It shouldn't be compared with a performance since it was shot much more like a film, mostly if not all, on location.  Compared to most performances I have seen on television, this is a very conservative effort and quite well done but evidently not for everyone.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|Not much needs to be said. This one is a keeper. A damn fine example of what music and passion coalesce into when they are in top form. I don't think Billy will ever get back to this kind of quality he had up and through Adore. This one really firmly sent the message out that his vision was something to be reckoned with. All the singles are here and the rest of the album is even better. Where MCIS was all about precise control of themes and an abundance of variety this one is all about guitar tones, fuzz, youth, and rocking out. I wouldn't have it any other way. Billy sometimes seems to laugh it off when old fans wax nostalgic about these days but nothing he has done in over ten years has quite matched this. Adore was probably the epitome of his lyrical ability and the last album I care to rate a masterpiece. I liked Machina quite a bit and then things started rolling down a steep hill. I know what good music is and he simply doesn't write very good tunes anymore.<br /><br />Deluxe comes with a lot of photos and extras and the session tracks which are all nice to have. The remastering is loud but not overly compressed and they should at least be credited with not pumping stuff up too much even though a lot of this is meant to be listened to LOUD. DR9 recording. There is a tad more detail in the basslines and drums and really everything that you can hear even when volume matched but I am not going to say the 1991 master was bad because it wasn't. It had a touch more dynamic range I guess but it's hard to day when you have this on high volume. I think I prefer the remaster all told though a couple sample bits have been excised do to rights. Nothing major. The new release is something to own if you have never purchased the Pumpkins. It's not worth going into the tracks. Just listen to it yourself or read another review.
159514188X|3.0|I was actually putting off reading this. Before I read it I didnt like the whole plot I just wasnt excited to read it so I took my sweet time getting to it and I'm glad I did. Basically the story revolves around Hannahs suicide, when she commited suicide she decided to leave these tapes that mention why she killed herself and if they got the tapes you were one of her reasons. They get sent to all these people but we get the story from Clay who for some reason got these tapes *spoiler alert* I hate that he got them because he did nothing and Hanahs reasons were kinda dumb.. There I said it I dont like her excuses ,  yes the stuff they did were horrible but she didn't do anything to get help sure she went to one person but she had Clay!! Why didnt she tell him!! Thats basically what annoyed me the most that she included Clay even though he did nothing! She basically tortured him and to me it was like \\"hear what everyone else did but oh yeah you had nothing to do with and you were so good to me but I want you to know what you didnt realize was going on\\" I felt like she just wanted to excuse her suicide. But I will admit the way she got bullied was horrible and does happen not all of it but it does happen. So finally I'm going to say yes I read it all but I did not love it at all. This book just wasnt for me. I give it 3 stars because it had some good points but yeah thats about it.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|As a teacher, researcher, and community organizer for the last 40 years, I found that this book brings together the many strands of my work and experience.  Drawing on the latest research, interwoven with stories of students' achievements that ring true as crystal, this book provides a clear path to a healthy, safe, and secure future for all children in America.  When Tough's understanding of grit, curiosity, and character becomes commonplace among policy makers and those who implement sound policies, the shackles that have held students back can fall away and America can regain her post as the country with the best schools in the world.

B00000DHTF|5.0|...after having experienced three shows in the Wrecking Ball tour, at each of which material from Tracks had resurfaced, I'm relistening to the set for the first time. Was it really 1998 when I got this, all wrapped up as a Christmas gift from a savvy child? In the following days, after a single spin through the set, I thought, \\"these are mostly 'B' sides that wouldn't displace a single track on the album they might have appeared on.\\" A common opinion, from a lot of reviewers way above my pay grade. I barely scraped up a pair of favorites, \\"Where the Bands Are\\" and \\"Cynthia,\\" which reminded me of the New Jersey and Asbury Park of my wilder days. Nevertheless, the set went onto the shelf. I moved it around, put it in the queue from time to time, but never got around to listening to it again.<br /><br />But now, after those intervening years, having listened on disc and live to a succession of Bruces, in different voices and styles, with dramatically different bands, and hearing the occasional Track pop up at a show - often leaving me to think, \\"I don't know that one: it must be off Tracks\\" - and prompted by a rousing performance of \\"Cynthia\\" at the last MetLife Meadowlands show last week (and leaving me with a \\"Cynthia\\" earworm I cannot dislodge) - the set now now sounds...brilliant. Even (EVEN! that I should even write \\"EVEN\\"!) the despised 4th disc from the Human Touch/Lucky Town bands...even that's wonderful. \\"Seven Angels,\\" \\"Gave It a Name,\\" and \\"Sad Eyes\\" is a simply beautiful sequence. These Tracks are disparate, musical, at times spiritual, some much stronger than others, but overall: lovely. New music. From Bruce.<br /><br />When he issued the songs of The Promise in the Darkness set, I thought, \\"now this is the shit! How unlike Tracks...\\" Well, it was...but it's not all that different from Tracks. The quality of these throw-aways is indicative of the immense fertility of the creative imagination of Bruce Springsteen, who stands in the rock pantheon with only Bob Dylan as a man who disdains to repeat himself, insisting on creating fresh new things, and performing them, on making his audiences listen, and spurning a life of 90 minute greatest hits tours, raking up mounds of money as a desiccated Dinosaur of Rock subsisting on the creative fumes of yesteryear. The body of work he's compiled, from the heavily Dylan/Van Morrison influenced albums of the early years through the more recent eclectic, political albums, in all its changes, still rewards frequent listenings. This neglected set of Tracks is an alternative chronicle of a long stretch of that mighty creative period - and is filled with songs I can remember hearing at the shows but at hardly any other time, including the moving, blue-eyed soul of \\"Back in Your Arms Again\\" that I'm listening to this second. Now Clarence's eloquent entry...<br /><br />Respect must be paid. Respect and admiration.

The inside is lined with a felt like soft fabric to protect the screen of your Kindle or Fire while in transit. This case held both my Kindle Keyboard and the husband's Fire - each one fit properly. My ONLY issue with this sleeve is that if you already have any type of skin or one of the Amazon lighted cases on your Kindle, it won't fit at all. You will have to remove your other covering in order to use the Timbuk2 ballistic sleeve. This is a pet peeve of mine - I want the lighted cover on my Kindle Keyboard for obvious reasons and if I want to add a dash of extra protection for traveling, then I'm out of luck. It's always a one or the other situation with all the electronics - smartphones, kindles, tablets....<br /><br />Having noted that one issue, I think overall, this is a very good sleeve that will offer some real protection for your gadget.
0345472322|5.0|I read this book when it was first published (2006) and recently re-read it before reading Daniel Siegel's Mindsight: The New Science of Personal Transformation. Presumably he shares my high regard for Carol Dweck's breakthrough insights, as countless other authors have duly acknowledged in books published in recent years. She focuses on two mindsets, one that is fixed and another that can be \\"grown\\" with appropriate development. Moreover, she also explains how and why it is possible to change one's mindset. \\"You have a choice. Mindsets are just beliefs. They're powerful beliefs, but they're just something in your mind, and you can change your mind. As you read [this book], think about where you'd like to go and which mindset will take you there.\\" Long ago, Henry Ford observed, \\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're probably right.\\"<br /><br />More recently, in Extraordinary Minds, Howard Gardner observes that exceptional individuals \\"have a special talent for identifying their own strengths and weaknesses.\\" Dweck suggets that those with this talent seem to have a growth mindset. Readers will appreciate her strategic provision of a \\"Grow Your Mindset\\" section at the conclusion of each chapter.  She poses direct questions, reviews key points, and suggests several different ways to think about how to expand and enrich mindsets to fulfill one's potential at home, at work, in the community, and wherever else has special relationships.<br /><br />These are among the subjects, topics, and passages that caught my eye:<br /><br />o  \\"Is Success About Learning -- Or Proving You're Smart?\\" (Pages 16-17)<br />o  \\"Mindsets Change the Meaning of Failure\\" (32-39)<br />o  \\"Mindsets Change the Meaning of Effort\\" (39-44)<br />o  \\"Negative Labels and How They Work\\" (74-80)<br />o  \\"Leadership and the Fixed Mindset\\" (112-114)<br />o  \\"Groupthink versus We Think\\" (134-136)<br />o  \\"Mindsets Falling in Love\\" (148-157)<br />o  \\"Bullies and Victims: Revenge Revisited\\" (165-171)<br />o  \\"Sending Messages [to Children] About Process and Growth\\" (177-179)<br />o  \\"Teachers (and Parents): What Makes a Great Teacher (or Parent)?\\" (193-202)<br /><br />I am among those who think that Mindset is among the most important books published during the last decade. While re-reading it again, I was reminded of three key points that help to explain much of human behavior: First, that almost all limits are self-imposed; next, that there is much we cannot control or even influence but we [begin italics] can [end italics] control how we respond to what happens to us; finally, that taking full advantage of a growth mindset requires a commitment no less demanding in terms of its nature and extent than a commitment to peak performance.

(For more about that research, read his HBR article, \\"The Making of an Expert,\\" and one or more of these books: Daniel Coyle's The Talent Code, Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers, and Geoff Golvin's Talent Is Overrated.)

0020442203|3.0|[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon.  These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted.  Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released.  I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written.  Mike London 10-3-2012]<br /><br />\\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", to be quite honest, is my least favorite of the Narnia books.  While it is the most well known book in the Narnia series and seems to receive the most adaptations, for this reader it is also the weakest. While my personal prejudice against the book may seem unjustified, I will go into detail on why it is this book does the least of all the books for me. However, do not think that I despise the book. Some of the individual scenes are my favorite in the series, including the meeting of Tumnas and Lucy and much of the actual world of Narnia. The scene with the professor stands out as well, as do others, including Edmond and the scene with the White Witch and her devilish Turkish Delight.<br /><br />The chief fault I have with this is the overly explicit Christianity in this book. The Chronicles represent very fundamental Christian faerie tales, and generally Lewis embodies Christianity with a very good story. For me, however, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" ceases to be good story and just mere allegory. I think of the Chronicles as something of magic themselves, and the spell of the series are the excellent stories that also have great Christian truths. The death of Aslan for the sake of Edmond totally ruins this spell for me. Again, this is personal taste.<br /><br />To best describe what I'm talking about, I will give you my personal view on why the series itself is good. Lewis, while always writing from the Christian standpoint, keeps first and foremost the story in mind. Christianity underlies it all, but the most important element is the story itself. Readers do not like to be preached at. If you tell a good story that has exhibits various elements of Christianity as its theme but keep the story original, that is a good faerie tale. Here, Lewis starts that and then stops that at the end and has Aslan die for Edmond. It would have been fine had the parallel not been so blatantly obvious. For me, it makes me lose focus of the story and concentrate on the Christianity solely. Still, it's like Lewis decides to make it very explicit what he is talking about instead of sticking to the less obvious.<br /><br />Another element that alienates this book from me is the inclusion of Father Christmas. I cannot specifically put my finger on it, but for some reason he does not sit well with me. We have this beautiful new world of Narnia, and here it's always winter and never Christmas. Why would they have Christmas in the first place? Again, I understand Father Christmas can represent the Holy Spirit, etc, and put it on the level that children will definitely relate too, but even when I was little I had an immediate dislike to this inclusion in the story.<br /><br />While the slain god myth is an essential archetype, it just does not work for me in this story. I would have rather Lewis come up with a more ingenuity and have a different way for Aslan to redeem him. How is the ultimate question. But he did do this with Eustace in \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\". While that may seem to be a rather harsh reaction to the opening book of the Narnia series, it was my initial reaction, and when rereading it, I am still of this opinion. Again, I recognize this is personal taste, and \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" is certainly deserving of its acclaim.<br /><br />For myself, the explicit Christianity ruins the otherwise flawless faerie tale atmosphere Lewis creates in this tale. Lewis does not violate my own personal aesthetics of endowing a story with Christianity without making the story seem bogged down with Christian elements in the series again with the exception of \\"Dawn Treader:. Every other story in the series the Christian themes but does not, in the end, breaking the spell of the faerie tale. It just feels like in LWW he starts preaching at us. But what do I know. It is probably the most popular of the seven books.<br /><br />\\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", a book I very dearly love, only breaks the spell at the very end and only as part of a comment from Aslan to the children. While certainly Christianity (i.e., a relationship with God) is the most important thing, for myself it brings down the story when Lewis has Aslan say that he brought the children to Narnia so that they may know him better in their own world. I guess it is meant to give hope to the children reading it that they will one day know Aslan, and it is certainly a worthy inclusion for the book, but I still feel, when I read it, that that is a little to explicit for me. The story ceases to be story and becomes just regular Christian doctrine, and while certainly we need Christian doctrine a story should be, first and foremost, a story.  However, Lewis's intent besides the story was to win souls to Christ, and if Narnia help does that, then ultimately that is more important than trivial literary concerns.<br /><br />You can tell this is the first one he wrote and that originally there was no thought of a series. There are several contradictions in between this and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", which include the ancestry of the White Witch and the belief that there have been no human beings in this world. Originally Lewis tried to stay true to this premise but Roger Lancelyn Green told him cut this long scene between a ploughman and his wife in another world and Lewis took his advice and instead went withthis concepts. Another case of this not being originally intended as a series is when asked about the story from Coriakin's book, Lucy is spoken of in the present tense, indicating she is still alive. Even Prince Caspian adheres to the original concept of the idea that there were no humans in Narnia at the beginning. Another element that, although working in the self-contained book that Lewis originally meant LWW to be, seems rather awkward to this reader is the professor. He is never named in LWW, but is so in MN. Father Christmas doesn't seem to fit either.<br /><br />This passage from \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" where White Witch is demanding the life of Edmund because he has betrayed the children and Aslan to the White Witch is one of Lewis's most overt allusions to Christianity in the series. Aslan makes the sacrifice. This also illustrates the fact that evil was not there in the beginning. The White Witch did not know the great magic from before the world's foundation. There were rules and ordinances that were not made known to the angels. Pride also blinds, because when Satan fell, he thought the crucifixition would truly solve the problem with Christ and his ministries. Jadis also thought this as well, that she would triumph in the end. Both were proud and glorified in their evil. Their belief is placed in the wrong deity.<br /><br />Lewis uses the colour white in the cold, wintery sense rather than white symbolising purity. The White Witch has put Narnia in a spell, freezing Aslan's land into a continuos winter than cannot be broken until two kings and two queens from the human race come to seat at Cair Paravel. The white is sickening and represents the cruelty. Ironically, Lewis reckons her colour as that of salt, which precisely what she is not. Salt is a natural preservative and adds flavour to the food, but the White Witch only ruins and destroys and perverts. Jadis, who also appears in \\"The Silver Chair\\", uses the natural colour perverts itinto the evil. Green often has been associated with the spring time. In \\"The Silver Chair\\", we find her as the Green Lady. She directs the children and Puddleglum to the giants of Harfang. Here, she appears to be a rather mysterious woman, but she shows her true colours in the Underworld. Jadis, just as she used the white as a perverted colour, here she uses green in her underground kingdom, because here that colour will never come. Spring cannot come to the Underworld, and if her plans would go through, she, like she did in Charn, would destory the world. Green, that vibrant colour of life, is chosen by her to mock spring.<br /><br />Although the winter is an unnatural one, the attitude the characters show for it is part of the pathetic fallacy.  From Wikipedia: \\"The pathetic fallacy is the treatment of inanimate objects as if they had human feelings, thought, or sensations. The word 'pathetic' in this use is related to 'pathos' or 'empathy' (capability of feeling), and is not pejorative. In the discussion of literature, the pathetic fallacy is similar to personification.\\"  When spring comes to Narnia, they all rejoice for the characters feel so much happier now that the winter is lifting. This also occurs in The Silver Chair with Scrubb and Pole. Jill thinks of the edge as being horrible simply because it is high, which is quite an odd attitude to take. If, by your very nature, you are skilled in mathematics and another person is not and they say. You are black or white or yellow or whatever, this colour has nothing to do with what you are like as a person. If the water is cold and someone says they love water when it is cold because it is so good, but it is bad when it is hot, that is pathetic fallacy. Cliffs are not bad or good - they're just cliffs and that is all.<br /><br />Although a worthwhile book, as I've explained I like the other Narnia novels much better than this one.  Tolkien likewise did not like this book for many of the same reasons.  He once wrote to a correspondent George Sayer, saying \\"It is sad that 'Narnia' and all that part of C.S.L.'s work should remain outside the range of my sympathy, as much of my work was outside his.\\"  Tolkien thought the mixture of various fairy tale motifs quite absurd.  Obviously the reading public has adored these books, and they are established literary classics, so if you haven't read LWW, give it a chance.  You may have a completely different view than myself and just love the work.  For myself, the other Narnia novels are so much better.<br />.<br />.<br />------------------------------<br />[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]<br /><br />Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The five works this essay will look at are \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", \\"The Silver Chair\\", and \\"The Last Battle\\". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.<br /><br />In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.<br /><br />In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half-breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which \\"truth\\" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half-breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.<br /><br />Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.<br /><br />Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complications if you do not do it his way.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomaly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.<br /><br />These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters.<br /><br />*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".

I found myself skipping paragraphs in hope of something interesting. Eva drove me crazy and came off as pathetic and overly needy. If you read the first book then I understand feeling the need to finish the series, but otherwise I say skip.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day is a genius story writer. This is depicted in Reflected in You. I have never bothered to write a review for a book before, but I just had to share how enthralled I have become with Eva and Gideon. The heartache and obsession that they share captures your heart as much as your imagination. To experience such completeness is rare, but can be experienced through this couple's adventure. I urge you to read this book for it's ability to transport you into the lives of a couple struggling to stay together when everything in life is working to rip them apart.

It just tells me that amazon is not responding wherein giving me two choices, \\"force close\\" or \\"wait\\" im getting frustrated. however, so far riordan has not disappointed. the book is as entertaining as those preceding it. from what ive read from other reviews others are experiencing these same issues. i also would like to point out that i havent had an experience like this with any of my other kindle purchases, so this is pretty weird.

Listen to this album, you will love it. And as a side note, I would recommend their song \\"Liar.\\" It's not on either album but I think it's Mumford at its best.

B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy Reichs has done it again! I have read every one of her books and they just keep getting better and better. I can not wait for her latest book to come out.<br />If you haven't read any of her books I would recommend you pick one up today.
B008N5UX9M|3.0|It needs a new singer because he sounds as if he's amatuerish. Sorry for saying so Steve but the singer is nothing campared to Dickinson or Di'Anno, especially early Di'Anno.<br />The first few songs musically are good arrangement wise but the singing leaves something to be desired. He sounds as if he had a few too many in the pub during karioke.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Well on top of this being one of the best movies of the year the customer service was our standing. I ordered this on Friday and received it on Monday. Plus when I got it it was $19.99 and shipping and handleing was free. So it was the best buy of the year.

B008I34YYY|4.0|I've been waiting nearly 4 years for this film and it did not disappoint.  Exactly what I expected.  A satirical B-Movie with Great Special Effects and a fantastic score by Laibach.  I recommend it to anyone that doesn't take their entertainment tastes too seriously and are open to B-Grade films.  Fun!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not sure to read this book, because of all the BSDM it had, i was not sure if that was for me.  However, when i finally decided to give it go, I was impress there is so much more than just a Dom and Sub relationship.  I fell in love with Ana and Grey since the beginning.  Their characters brought out emotions to me that I was positive that this book was not going to give me, and I was extremely glad that it prove me wrong.<br /><br />It is a book full of love, sex, and heartbreak which was keeping me reading it until very late at night.  This book is so much more than  BSDM relationship it is about two people caring for each other and not knowing how to be together because it is the first time they are both commiting themselves to a relationship.<br /><br />I felt that the story was easy to follow and all the characters were very well developed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just finished reading Reflected in you and just WOW! completely surpassed my expectations, i don't want to give anything away but fans will love the twist and turns that Eva and Gideon's relationship take cant wait for the next one.

B005LAJ23A|5.0|This season: who will survive?<br /><br />Season two continues the gangs story of survival in a death filled zombie apocalypse world with more drama, false hope, and moral themes. Many viewers often talked about the stretching out of certain subplots, but I feel its all about timing. Consider that the TV series airs with mid-season breaks and small cliffhangers certain events need to play out. Plus I feel its for added drama effect. Only then will you understand that the timing makes sense and justifiable (I won't want to reveal spoilers even with season two long over). Timing in a tv series is all about impact to the viewer and this series excels at it. The ending to this season leaves you begging for a quick return to season three.<br /><br />In season one I noticed a lot of \\"film grain\\" or noise if you will. I accepted it and thought it added to the setting and tone of the series. This seasons transfer onto blu-ray is still great and perhaps better than season one. While some other HD shows either use \\"better\\" cameras (such as Game of Thrones) the picture still remains plenty sharp. I'd rate the surround sound about the same as I would picture quality.<br /><br />Extra's finally add the webisodes with its story telling shifting to a background character from the first season. Its worth a watch. I do wish since this was the blu-ray that the webisode could not show the AMC logo. The minidocuments are all entertaining but like most extra's these days can be viewed a bit too quickly. I truly wish they would've included the addition of \\"The Talking Dead\\" on the extra's. Maybe season three and maybe on a collectors edition? Its a great aftershow that compliments the episodes while they air, and something I think hardcore viewers would like archived on blu-ray to view again.<br /><br />The Walking Dead seasons on blu-ray are a day one must buy in my book. No blu-ray collection should be without this incredible tv series.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This book is a tough one to convey in a 2.5 hour movie but I believe Gary Ross did a pretty good job preserving the important plot lines and setting the stage for the additional meaning the protagonist's actions take in the sequels. The special features were above par and help understanding th ationale behind the things that did make it into the film.
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|A very unusual picture, very interesting,  Loved the dog.  The black and white setting was very good as was the music.  Characters well played

0316228532|4.0|I felt compelled to write this review... as I'm convinced that most people bad-mouthing this book weren't even able to finish it.<br /><br />Let me say I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan... and I bought this book with the full understanding that it was going to be NOTHING like Harry Potter, and in my mind my expectations were left wide open.<br /><br />Well... maybe not quite wide enough! lol<br /><br />I will admit I was a little shocked at it's obtrusiveness. There is swearing and a lot of adult content. And not titilating adult content, but the kind of things you know happen in the world, but that you don't like to dwell upon. Well, this book dwells upon them.<br /><br />The first 3rd of the book for me was a difficult read. You're reading about not nice situations, involving hardly any likeable people, and it's hard to digest. Infact, there were some places where I physically felt sick by what I'd just read and wasn't sure that it was always necesary.<br />However after a slow opening, the book really does pick up pace. And I found myself once again being overwhelmed by Rowlings writing talent; all but in an entirely new way as compared to Potter.<br /><br />The book opens with the death of a prominant townsman. You then see the fallout and results of this death through the eyes of all the different townspeople. From teens to seniors... upper class to very lower class... the story flitters back and fourth from person to person as we see the goings on behind closed doors in little Pagford through their (all very different) eyes.<br /><br />What you can't help but marvel at is Rowlings ability to create so many characters, and to create them with such incredible depth.  For you are not just viewing these people from a distance as secondary characters, you are inside there minds and their innermost thoughts. Thoughts that are at times disturbing and cringeworthy, sometimes sad and pitiful, and even funny. And Rowling is able to create the mind of a heroin junkie as vividly as that of a sex-crazed teenage boy, and the result is impressive.<br /><br />Above all, these characters she's managed to create are realistic and very human. You will see in these pages people you know, people you go out of your way to avoid, and perhaps even parts of yourself.<br />I can admit that I didn't necessarily \\"care\\" for any of these people, but I was fascinated by them and the last two 3rds flew by for me in a very readible way.<br /><br />I appreciated it on the basis of Rowlings amazing characterisation skills.<br /><br />So if you know what your in for, and you have patience, then you will get something from this book. It certainly makes you think about yourself and the people around you. Of how we all interact and view each other.

B007QSNMS6|5.0|Any journey on the path of change, especially at a chaotic and beautiful time as this, should start with Velocity. This should be an essential read for anyone on a mission to create magic, disruption or the upholding of human creative spirit.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|This was not what I saw at the show. I got three differnt movies,and none of them were like the moive that I saw this summer.I love going to the movies, and I love seeing them over and over again but this one I was very upset about it, they took to much out of it.I wish they would just leave it alone it was great as it was and now it is not.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|This is a great film with such a convoluted plot & an awesome cast. The blu-ray high definition tops it all off.
1595828753|4.0|This new arc is a fun and great paced story for hardcore fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender, it picks up right where the series left off and gives a preview at the origins of a new era in the world of Avatar. Despite all the bad reviews that pan this book for \\"terrible writing\\", \\"character development absence\\" and \\"hideous art\\", it has a great take on the characters we all love and this is a definite must have for benders and non-benders alike.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|After listening to the album over and over again, I have come to conclusion that it is probably Muse's weakest album to date. But as you can tell from my four star rating, this does not mean it's bad. The 2nd Law will definitely be a huge surprise to Muse fans, anyone else listening to this for the first time, will probably have the same thoughts they'd have listening to Muse for the first time.<br /><br />Stand out tracks:<br />Supremacy<br />Madness<br />Animals<br />Save Me<br />Unsustainable<br /><br />What was that? track:<br />Explorers<br /><br />One thing I miss the most, and I think other Muse fans would agree, are the guitar sounds. This album is just not as \\"heavy\\" in the rock area as their previous albums have been. Ultimately, still has Muse's touch on it, but with a new twist.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read Bared To You this summer at the beach and really enjoyed the first book in the series. I am an avid reader and when I start a series I finish it. Period. I was looking forward to Reflected in You but not obsessively so. Can I please say - OMG! The second book far out surpasses the first one. I cried too many times to count. I laughed, too. Didn't we all know it's okay to flip the bird because it's a \\"classic\\". I cannot wait for the next and final book. I feel this one cemented their relationship, whether you feel that is a good thing is up to you. Their relationship is hot and off the charts as are the sex scenes. I highly recommend the series if you like fiction with a little more erotica than usual. There is an obvious comparison to FSOG as the story lines are similar but Eva is absolutely not an Ana clone. I refuse to give spoilers in a review but the twists will shock you and break your heart. I can't wait for Entwined to be published. Now, my anticipation is obsessive.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|I  just loved this movie.  I watch it over again every so often and I laugh almost as hard as the first time I saw it.  I<br />have bought copies of it for my son and my granddaughter.  It is a really funny English comedy
B001O1O71C|5.0|This was a good book, well written, easy to read, and perfectly told from a childs perspective. It was heartfelt, touching, innocent, yet a stark reminder of a point in time we will [should] never forget. I will remember these two boys for the rest of my life! 5 Star reading.
031286504X|5.0|I've read a lot of lower-rating reviews express emotion ranging from slight disappointment to Chris Nealic Outrage about the fact all 317 pages in this book aren't dedicated to the telling of the title story. Let's get this out of the way right now -- there are 11 stories in this book. \\"I Am Legend\\" starts at page 1 and ends at page 170. There. I wrote it for all the readers to read. Sorry for the spoiler.  [By the way, if you haven't read the book, don't worry if you don't know what Chris Nealic Outrage is. You'll get it when you read \\"Mad House.\\" If you have read the book, shame on you for not getting that.]<br /><br />The uniting theme of all 11 stories in this book is death. It's all about death and how it comes to human beings, and what happens to those who survive us -- how easily we can kill each other -- how there may or may not be an afterlife -- how we may or may not be able to contact those who've died.<br /><br />Two of the stories in this book have been depicted in at least four movies I'm aware of -- \\"The Last Man on Earth,\\" \\"Omega Man,\\" \\"I Am Legend,\\" and \\"Trilogy of Terror.\\" With the exception of \\"Trilogy of Terror,\\" where \\"Prey\\" is one third of the trilogy, the movies don't come anywhere close to the actual story in the book. Of course, the other three movies were based on or inspired by \\"I Am Legend,\\" but you couldn't tell by watching them, though, maybe Vincent Price in \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" comes closest.<br /><br />In case you aren't aware, Richard Matheson has written many books that have spawned movies. For example, \\"What Dreams May Come,\\" \\"Stir of Echoes,\\" \\"Duel,\\" and \\"Real Steel\\" are all based on Matheson novels or short stories. He's also written for \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" and other TV shows during his long career, and you can tell it in his writing (he even has a girl trip in one of the stories as she's running through the woods in terror -- yeah, he went there). He's not the sort of writer whose prose reads like extended poetry, who packs entire scenes and character sketches, histories, into single sentences like, say, Thomas Pynchon or William Gaddis do. No, Matheson's writing is well crafted, to be sure, but it's more geared toward an Everyman or Joe Six-Pack who wants to be entertained while not intellectually insulted. In fact, if Pynchon and Gaddis are luxury cars, Matheson is a muddy, dented, well-used pick-up truck that will get you somewhere a luxury car can't get you -- and though the ride may be rough here and there, the payoff will be well worth it. The worlds he takes you to are unique, the thoughts he provokes ... interesting at the very least, sometimes, downright scary.<br /><br />The reason I mention these things is because Matheson has a lot of history not only with the reading public, but also anyone who watches TV and movies like the ones mentioned above. So, when you read this book, I would suggest looking at the years the stories were first published. Realize that \\"I Am Legend\\" was written in 1954, \\"Prey,\\" 1969, \\"Mad House,\\" 1952. Pretend you've never heard of any of the movies, forget all about Will Smith, and don't judge the writing from today's perspective. (Yes, Dr. Lurice Howell is probably a perfect example of a female magical negro character, I know. Just enjoy the show though. You can write a condemnation of Matheson when you finish the book. But remember \\"From Shadowed Places\\" was written in 1960.) Just pretend some old WWII vet you know shared a beat up, faded binder with 11 stories he wrote way back in the day (Matheson actually did see combat in WWII, by the way). Have a drink or two if you're not a teetotaler, stop to use google maps as he mentions locations, youtube the music he mentions, take your time with these stories and I think you'll agree this collection is not only entertaining, it's downright spooky at times, as well as unforgettable.<br /><br />One side note: If you're familiar with John Steinbeck's books, you may have noticed how much he loves to mention what characters are doing with their feet. They're always wiggling their toes, standing with one foot on top of the other, scratching their opposite leg with a foot, &c. Matheson has a similar habit, except with him, it's throat movements.<br /><br />[Oh, and, yeah, of all 11 stories in this book, the one that actually creeped me out was \\"Dress of White Silk.\\" --  maybe because I read it at three in the morning]n what characters are doing with their feet.

B004FLIXVS|5.0|Studio albums are the purest interpretation by a band.  Its exactly what they want it to sound like.  When a live version of the same song comes out, its like hearing a different song.  You feel their emotion and the energy of the performance and the best part is, you're hearing an unhinged version.  The solos, the ad libs, the mistakes are pure stoke.  Having a live album is not just another version of the song, when you love a band its a fix.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I'll admit that while I liked \\"We Are Young\\" I wasn't ready to buy the whole album. Then I heard Carry On used on TLC and I was hooked. The album is a wonderfully entertaining album, with fun instrumentals.
030758836X|3.0|The ending was soooo disappointing. It was as if you we're blowing up a balloon, and by the time you reached the perfect plump size, the climax, someone comes over with a needle and pops it. Simple analogy, but exactly what happen.

B008G12ERC|4.0|Muse has always attempted to top each previous album with something more grand than any before it. They have done this consistently, but they lose some aspects of themselves each time and it becomes more apparent on this album. Some subtlety is lost, but overall the album is likable and a worthy purchase.<br /><br />Incorporating other styles has always been something Muse caters to, but on the last album they let loose with a sound that drew comparisons to Queen. It was well received so this time they decided to go for broke in a couple of places. The result can be disturbing and in places un-enjoyable.<br /><br />1. Supremacy - Similar to some sounds from [[ASIN:B000AMPZF8 Origin of Symmetry]] but with a dark, symphonic sound lain over it like a blanket. A grand way to kick off an album, but lyrically it doesn't have the clever subtlety to its politically inclined lyrics that they were once great with. This becomes a recurring issue in places on this album, but here it is handled with enough care that it ends up working. Bellamy is in top form here, with his distorted wailing of the title rising over the rest of the song to remind us that he has one of the most incredible ranges in rock music today.<br /><br />2. Madness - When asked about this song in an interview Bellamy stated that it was the band stripped down to the bare essentials, a love ballad in a low-key sound with a less-is-more vibe. Out of all that the true statements were that it was a low-key love ballad. This song is excessively electronic and the vocals seem forced in places. I want to hear Bellamy use his Michael Jackson sound almost as much as I want to hear Chris Martin exhale sensuously mid-ballad. The redeeming grace here is Wolstenholme's use of the Misa Kitara, a new kind of digital/electronic guitar that requires completely new skills to play. This song is entertaining but over-produced and easily forgettable.<br /><br />3. Panic Station - This took me by surprise at first, but admittedlywound up being one of the most fun songs on the album. Channeling the dead pop star, Bellamy lets his inner Jackson out with wails and shrieks. This (shockingly) winds up working quite well in a catchy song. The beat is basic but the real drive lies in the mixture of brass instruments with the band itself to create a fun, full sound. All members of the band fire on all cylinders on this one and you can tell that more than anything the group is just having a lot of fun with it. This will become a live staple in no time and is set to become a single before too long.<br /><br />4. Prelude - Orchestral piece meant to lead into the next track. Nothing super special about it, but it winds up being an emotionally swelling introduction.<br /><br />5. Survival - I have mixed feelings on this song. When it was released as the official song of the Olympic Games this year I got nervous. This is where they let their Queen influence shine the most and outside context of the album as a whole it suffers. Muse has always been known for attempting to be over the top and grand, but short of resurrecting Freddy Mercury live onstage to help perform the song there isn't much more they can rise to here, its as extreme as it gets. The lyrics are interesting, and I'm not sure if this is a good type of interesting. It feels like Muse sat down and watched every action movie ever, picking out cliche or overused lines dripping in Van-Damme-ish machismo and then lining them up so they rhyme in the time signature of the song. Having said all of this the song actually fits well on the album, if only a bit awkwardly. It is nowhere near a favorite of mine, but I don't cringe at the sound of it like I did when it first came out.<br /><br />6. Follow Me - I feel sad that this will wind up being one of the more overlooked songs on the album because it is a treasure. This is a simple, adorable song that is audibly pleasing and uplifting in a rare show of emotion for Muse. They have always been about thelarger picture, but here we see them do something that hasn't truly been done since [[ASIN:B002BGCCZC Absolution]]. The guitar work here fuses perfectly with the electronics. Listen and enjoy.<br /><br />7. Animals - The line \\"Buy when blood is on the streets\\" seems to indicate a media-aimed shot taken here. The track is similar to the style they used to adhere to, with the bass guitar taking the rhythm and leaving the single guitar in the band to play lead throughout and it winds up working really well. For a song about how horrible humanity can be it came off as a fun, reminiscent track. About halfway through it picks up and leads Bellamy into a basic solo, nothing as impressive as the riff to Plug In Baby but still entertaining as it continues to swell into a more brutal sound that they used to be known for. One of the better songs on the album overall.<br /><br />8. Explorers - Opens with a keyboard line and Bellamy's softer vocals singing semi-awkward-for-Muse lyrics about freeing the soul from the world so that it can soar with its' great love and see things in lands that aren't owned. Overall a forgettable track but no doubt post-modern progressive rock lovers will be composing adorable youtube videos to each other with this in the background before too long.<br /><br />9. Big Freeze - Jangly guitars and an unimpressive rhythm are saved here by excellent, soaring vocals. Rather odd as its a song about how global warming has destroyed us all, but its a fun song about how global warming has destroyed us all.<br /><br />10. Save Me - One of the most impressive songs on the album. Nothing on this set is as different as allowing Chris Wolstenholme to take over lead vocals here and sing his first of two songs about his problems with alcoholism. The softer of his tracks, this one is slow and sweet. Lead in by basic, drag-picked chords and light overlays, this song is meant to showcase his voice more than anything. It screams \\"This isn't Matt singing, its the otherguy!\\" and it couldn't be better for them. After a set of ok to good songs we get something that feels honest, open, and pleasant as the energy picks up and Bellamy joins is a background harmony. The bass here is simplistic and unimpressive, but its overshown by his singing. This will be a live staple and one of the more talked-about songs from this collection.<br /><br />11. Liquid State - Wolstenholme's other track on The 2nd Law is more brutal and harsh in tone and delivery than the other, and its excellent. The songs were meant to showcase what he is capable of and we are treated to two completely different sounds. Gritty and harsh, Chris snarls like Liam Gallagher or Craig Nicholls with a big more meat in his performance than either. He shows here that he is capable of carrying his own ideas and songs, something I hope to see more of on the next album. Lyrically it isn't too different than any other song about a person dealing with alcohol addiction, but it doesn't do any less than the best of them.<br /><br />12. The 2nd Law: Unsustainable - If only the second half could have delivered musically what the first half delivers. The dramatic, epic introduction feels cinematic with its orchestral and choral pieces fusing together in a sound worthy of Hans Zimmer or Clint Mansell. Too bad it is ruined by the dubstep second half. I'm all for experimenting, but this isn't even an interesting portrayal of the new electronic fad sound. It carries the most basic and disappointing feel, with the robotic cries of \\"unsustainable\\" in the background. I get that it is supposed to be more impressive because they do it with instruments instead of a computer, but when it sounds like every lazy dubstep song out there it can't hold itself up. Even when the orchestration comes back the song just comes off as patronizing and pandering. I skip this almost every time. A word on the lyrics: there are 2 ways to get your point across in music. One is by being clever and disguising it in lyrics, by using poetry and the charm of your sound to carry your personal beliefs to a willing audience. Then there's the way that involves musically writing it on a hammer and hitting your audience in the face with it. This is the latter. The 'lyrics' (which are included in the album sleeve...ridiculously unnecessary) are a fake broadcast on the dangers of basing an economy on constant growth and how the 2nd Law makes this unsustainable. Previously Muse has been known for disguising their political leanings behind excellent music/vocals and clever lyrics, going so far as to have the album [[ASIN:B002O1TMI4 The Resistance]] be one larger political statement in and of itself. And all this used to work. But they gave up on subtlety on this album. This is a song that will be jammed down fan throats at performances and by other fans and media outlets, but there aren't many saving graces to it.<br /><br />13. The 2nd Law: Isolated State - The music is much more well done on this song. The piano riff fuses perfectly with the bass line thundering behind it and the drums here are as minimalist as it gets. I would have been happy with this as an instrumental with Bellamy wailing in the background, but it has more 'lyrics' (also included in the album sleeve...again ridiculously unnecessary) that are merely leftover pieces of the the previous song's fake broadcast. The song is nowhere near ruined, but it could have been better without the forced message.<br /><br />Decent album overall, mostly enjoyable. As with all music there will be fans that hail every new release as the best the band has ever done and of course will praise it without any doubt (see Coldplay fans for examples of this, they could release an album full of auto-tuned Kesha covers and their fans would buy it) but I urge you to listen to this objectively. There is a lot of promise for future releases contained on this album and a lot of good and bad experimentation. This could be a stepping stone to a true masterpiece, but it isn't perfect by any means. Muse have created something worth the purchase with only a few complaints, and I urge anyone serious about experimentation and creativity in music to buy this but don't worship it. Fan worship is how bands get stuck.<br /><br />Enjoy the new Muse ladies and gentlemen.
0316044695|5.0|If you don't have appreciation for our military and pride for this country and what it stands for after reading a book like this one, you should probably just leave this country. This book reads like you are watching a great action movie. I didn't want to put it down. Definitely recommend.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I was playing this game for about a mouth when all my puzzles just disapered. (Its not fun when u have to do puzzles that you don't like)!!!!! But could be a good game if you didn't have your puzzles taken away!!!
B002VX0A40|5.0|Our son loves this little dragon. As he was born in the Year of the Dragon, it is one of his many dragon-themed toys, but this one is a favorite. The textures are myriad and engaging...soft, plush body, corduroy belly, mirrored tail, rattle in one hand and colorful flower in the other and crinkly wings. I was a little worried about the ribbon pieces coming off and presenting a potential choking hazard but this is not the case. Construction is solid. Highly recommended for all little dragons out there.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|this app is great when you need to add a few cool details. I use it for the simple edits I need to do like red eye and contrast levels...(ect)
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I love that this set was a great price, and it has all three toy story movies on it. The movies are three of Pixar's finest works. These are movies that you can sit down with the family on Thanksgiving or Christmas, and everyone in the family, from toddlers to grandparents can watch. Great purchase!

1609611543|5.0|Good information that opens one's eyes to how our food (wheat) has dramatically changed in the past 60+ years.  Some of the information is a bit technical, but Dr. Davis adds his humor to make it okay if one does not totally understand.  He will then restate the information in lay terms so the common man can \\"get it\\"!  The facts are very clear, backed by solid research and evidence.  Everyone should read this book for their health!

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I picked up watching this on ABC the final season and was never able to finish it. This year I was able to read the books (didn't realize that the books where out there) I LOVED the book series (Sword of Truth by Terry Goodkind) and felt like I wanted to watch the TV series again.<br /><br />It's true that there are many differences in the books and this made for TV series. I think there were a few details that were changed that bugged me, but overall the show is very entertaining and I'm very glad I purchased the complete first and second season.<br /><br />The acting is great. The story lines are great and the scenery is beautiful. It is one of my favorites and I really wish we had more the 2 seasons to explore and save the world with Richard and Kahlan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|6+++ stars!<br /><br />SQUEEEEE SQUEEEEE SQUEEEEE SQUEEEEE!!!!!!!<br /><br />THIS. BOOK. WAS. ABSOLUTELY. UTTERLY. PERFECT.<br /><br />I loved every, single moment of it!<br /><br />If I had custom ordered this book straight from the deepest book desires of my heart, it could not have been any better.<br /><br />Gideon Cross (oooo even his name gives me shivers) and Eva Tramell are one of my TOP favorite book couples ever. It was absolutely beautiful to watch a couple who were just so messed up but who wanted, with every fiber of their beings and every corner of their hearts, to do everything in their power to make their relationship work. Who were willing to sacrifice anything for each other. Who were willing to apologize. To never give up. To try again. And again and again and again until they made it work. Together.<br /><br />Absolutely beautiful!!!!<br /><br />The strength of their attraction, desire and need for each other is palatable. You can feel it rolling off the page. It hits you every single time. Its scorching. Consuming. Riveting. Intoxicating. But lust isn't enough to make a relationship truly work. In order for their love to have the room to properly and healthily develop, they have to learn to trust each other. And that truly is what is at the heart of this book. Trust.<br /><br />With a couple with as many issues, hang-ups, and mess ups as Gideon and Eva, yes, I admit it was sometimes frustrating to read through their problems. But the thing was, despite some of them being irrational and over-the-top, I sympathized with both of them about their insecurities and worries. Everything they felt, I understood. Sometimes it was painful, but always understandable.<br /><br />They were not perfect people. They both had secrets. They both had a lot to learn about how to trust each other, find safety in each other, heal each other, save each other... and in doing so, find a way to save themselves.<br /><br />But as messed up as they both were, they worked through EVERYTHING!! A couple after my own heart. **SQUEEEE**<br /><br />Gideon is the epitome of a complex, tortured, flawed, and mysterious hero. But my dear God does he make my heart (and my panties) melt!!! I swear, flaws and all, that man is pure perfection to me. I absolutely adored everything about his character. Everything.<br /><br />And we get a lot more insight into him- into his secrets, his nightmares, how he became so rich, what he felt when they first met. For a story told entirely from Eva's perspective, we do learn a lot about him in this book.<br /><br />Eva is one of my favorite heroines as well. Never once have I wanted to throttle her. She, just like Gideon, is seriously flawed and scarred by her past. She has real insecurities,  jealousies, worries, but I sympathized with them all and loved her spirit, her dedication and her decisions.<br /><br />As a couple, they were just so functional!!  Watching them work so hard at their relationship, where no matter what went wrong, letting nothing tear them apart... it was inspiring, heart warming, and beautiful.<br /><br />This book put my heart through a delicious ringer. It made it race, flutter, melt, burn, freeze, drop, pound, stop... It broke my heart and it healed my heart. I loved every minute!!!<br /><br />Let me tell you though, in this book, Gideon will test your trust, patience and faith in him to the absolute limit. He asks for Eva's trust, but as the reader, I felt for her SO strongly that it was MY trust I was putting out there. I realized before all the drama started that I had a choice and a decision to make: Did I trust him? Or didn't I?<br /><br />I realized that I loved his character enough to trust that he wouldn't ever betray her... I was patient with him way past the point where I'd have lost patience with any other character. But again, and again, and again I trusted, he tested, I waited, I trusted and he tested some more. Serious props to Ms. Day for putting me RIGHT in the heroine's mind. When you feel for what a character is going through with all your heart, that's a sign of absolutely brilliant writing.<br /><br />Please please please... if you are going to read this and hit that point where you think you are going to lose faith in Gideon, just hang on. Trust me, the ending is worth every moment of heart ache!!!<br /><br />\\"He caught me to him, his arms banded tight around me. His face pressed into my throat. \\"Where do we go from here?\\"<br />I held him. \\"Wherever this takes us. Together.\\"<br /><br />I can't tell you how absolutely happy the ending made me!!!! Seriously, I felt like I could fly!! *happy dance*<br /><br />And on the note of the ending... IS IT DECEMBER YET??!!!!??!<br /><br />****PS.

158510423X|5.0|This is by far the best Latin textbook out there. I used this for self-study, and it worked marvelously. I did have some previous exposure to more conventional books (Wheelock) and so had some basic knowledge already, but I'm confident it works just as well if you start from scratch with this.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented on the many virtues and the high entertainment value of Orberg's method (especially if compared with the mind-numbing drudgery of, say, Wheelock's book). In my opinion, what really makes this stand head and shoulders above everything else out there is the fact that this is the only Latin text that gives you a wealth of REASONABLY PACED reading material. It seems obvious that reading proficiency can only be gained through a lot of practice, but other textbook authors seem not to have noticed. Rather, they let you memorize abstract grammar ad nauseam and then, to add insult to injury, let you try your wits at literary material that is completely out of reach at this point (see Wheelock again, for illustration).<br /><br />As a (prospective) self-learner of Latin, you'd be out of your mind to try anything else. And don't let concerns about whether \\"Latin only\\" is a good idea scare you; this is a very minor aspect of Orberg's book, and probably you'll be using some of the English supplementary materials anyway.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I used the Palm app for years and through several upgrades. This is a definite downgrade. Not only do the docs change in appearance more dramatically, but it's also a great deal harder to perform operations such as Excel functions. A definite disappointment.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book.  I came here and read the reviews and that encouraged me to keep reading.  Once you get to the second part, the book really gets good.  I've never been so surprised by a book, it was really well crafted until the end.  I really hated how the book ended.  I feel like either we need a sequel or she should have kept the book going a little longer and given it a proper ending.  I felt like I was left hanging.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I thought it was good story line, but a lot of the \\"scenes\\" and emails were mildly funny. Will read the nwxt one.
B008WHQZJI|4.0|Good to hear from PSB, they are a band on my \\"like\\" list...not a devoted follower or anything, just enjoyed their music and lyrical sense in their 80's stuff.  This album does not depart from their tried-and-true too much, and is loaded with their satirical style (listen to \\"Ego Music\\" track to see what I mean, fun stuff).<br /><br />Easy listening, nothing heavy....nice.
0812993292|1.0|I found this book utterly depressing and not helpful.As we age, it is important to find something uplifting and to be able to appreciate our lives, even the smalls things like a sunset, the smell of a rose etc.I kept reading the book hoping there would be something redeeming about it at the end- but alas, it kept getting worse and more depressing.<br />What's helpful to the reader about reading about a life full of regrets, despair, suicide, horrible deformation and disability by cancer,inability to connect with one's spouse and child, impending Alzheimers? I have read many books about death and dying, cancer etc but nothing as depressing as this book. This book is like day and night compared to inspiring books like \\"dying to be me\\" by Anita Morjani (non-fiction!) or \\"the fault in our stars\\" by john Green. You can write about real life in a positive, uplifting way. This book was a totally downer in my book.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love this app because it keeps my childeren quiet and busy. I even play it some times. In the game, you try to fill coustomers orders, make the cafe food, sit the coustomers down, direct them to the bathroom, serve the food, and operate the cash register.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After enjoying the Movie \\"Serenity\\" as much as I did, to find out that it was part of a series was a surprise to me, and based of my opinion of the Movie, I purchased the series. Even though the series version and the movie version differ, I found the series very well presented. In fact, I wish the series had lasted longer than it did, would have loved to see more of their exploits.A good crew of relatively unknown actors who seemed to work together well on a series of well crafted stories. Like a few other series that I can think of, it seems the powers that be scrap the enjoyable series and keep the garbage running forever, this is the reason I hardly ever watch any of the 5000 channels available and stick to 1 or 2 and as a consequence miss out on a few of the jems that miraculously make it into their short termed runs.Sad but true.
B008RYN44U|4.0|It's been 11 years since their last album and a lot of things have changed. They've grown older. Most of their original fans have grown older. Their music, then, also had to grow more mature. They're all in their forties now. Who in their right mind would think that they could effectively pull-off another Tragic Kingdom? That was a different time. Is this their best album? No. Nor is this their most original work. It shows where they are now musically. The lyrics show where their lives are now. Mellower, quieter, and less neurotic. Those who complain about No Doubt \\"selling out\\" or \\"losing their edge\\" sound like those people we see at high school reunions who haven't taken to heart the fact that those years are over and times have changed.

0062197258|3.0|This story gripped me all the way through with riveting and believable surprises.  The chapters shift between the clubbing, reckless soon-to-be-victim and her post-trauma hell of maladapted strategies for making it through the day.  What jarred me, though, were several instances of dramatic, unexplained shifts in her mood that just weren't credible.<br /><br />For example, at location 7099:  \\"I wasn't afraid, but I did feel more than a little bit queasy -- unsettled, as though I was heading for something terrible and unpredictable.  I sat enjoying the breeze through the open window....\\"<br /><br />I can imagine a zen master living in the present moment and enjoying the breeze despite a sense of pending terror...  But an individual so wracked by anxiety that she's often late for work because she has to check her locks over and over?  A story that's essentially a psychological profile of an abuse victim and her long, painful recovery should have more thoughtful emotional bearings.
B005JZBP8W|2.0|In addition to fuzzyness and glowing halos mentioned in other reviews, my version has a horrible alignment of sound track and lip movements, almost like they were originally speaking in Chinese. The singing portions are even more out-of (lip) sync. No credits at the end at all except for the \\"restorers\\". Pure garbage version of one of my favorite musicals. I didn't check for English subtitles, which I usually show on my Movie Night Parties with my international friends (who could hardly be expected to follow all the diverse accents in this movie), but if the reviews saying they do not exist are true, makes it an even worse choice. Of course, I have no idea how they would transliterate all the dialects in proper English!
B0018M6J90|5.0|Guinevere Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) is an out-of-work, homeless, and hungry governess on the London streets of 1939.  In desperation she knocks on Delysia Lafosse's (Amy Adams) door. In this madcap romantic comedy that takes place in one day, Pettigrew and Lafosse hit it off immediately with the older woman becoming  Delysia's \\"social secretary.\\"  The impulsive young singer/aspiring actress offers quite a challenge to straight-laced Pettigrew as Delysia is juggling two relationships with men who offer her career possibilities along with her relationship to her \\"true love.\\"  The cast is excellent, the movie is funny, affecting, sweet, lighthearted, and poignant.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this was quite fun.not too long and not too short. Wish there was a little more to the characters but overall does not put me off the story. I'm now waiting for the sequel! creepy and engaging!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was very excited to see this book and it was a major disappointment.  It was dreary, depressing and boring.  The world created in this book is not one anyone would want to visit.  I find it hard to believe that the same author who wrote the Harry Potter books could have actually written this book.  There was absolutely not one minute of joy or hope in the entire book and I disliked all of the characters.
0525953728|4.0|This is a must-read for anyone who wants to know the real story of the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011.  The book gives an eye witness account of the Navy SEAL raid and exactly how Bin Laden was killed.  This differs from the TV and newspaper accounts that reported the incident shortly after it was made public by the President. And, unlike the pre-publication conjecture by the press, there is absolutely no government classified or secret information revealed.  The book also gives insight into the life and experience of the Navy SEAL author, whose real name is not revealed. In fact none of the actual names of the members of the SEAL team who carried out the mission are given.<br /><br />The only minor flaw and the reason that I did not give this book 5 stars was the lack of a glossary of acronyms, which are commonly listed in books about military action. The author uses them liberally throughout the text and does not always define their meaning. Other than that, it's a great account of an important historical event.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have read every Reacher novel -- and until recently enjoyed them. In \\"Wanted Man\\" Reacher, formerly a man of action in fast-moving stories, has become a man of virtual inaction in a slow-moving story. Now, instead of quick action, Reacher is able to provide area codes for almost anywhere. The story is written as though Lee Child had an electronic encyclopedia handy and used it to provide myriad, unnecessary, boring details. The previous Reacher novel was somewhat slow; this one removes the somewhat. Way back Lee Child had hypothesized that a battle between Reacher and Robert B. Parker's Spenser would be interesting. Only if one wanted to see Reacher defeated -- quickly.
B008RYN44U|4.0|More mature and much older...I always kept an open-mind when it comes to music and it works here for me.Whether it sounds like a Gwen Stefani solo album or whatever,it is a fun album.From beginning to end,each song kept my attention and wanting more.Ballads and No Doubt trademark pop rockers.If it is their last album,to me they ended it quite nicely.I will only look forward to the next Gwen album and look back at the fine music No Doubt brought to me for over 20 years...Buy it and you will enjoy  Aloha!!!!!

B005ZUR724|1.0|It says kindle fire edition... But doesn't play on the new kindle fire. When I attempt to contact Gameloft, I get non answers.  (Sorry your device isn't supported please download one of our other games.)  I played this game on a Acer A100, a Kindle Fire 2011 and recently on a nexus 7 that I returned due to poor build quality and a glitchy screen.  Gameloft has been very slow to provide any android updates or device support, and quite frankly I am sick of being treated like a second class citizen..just because I don't own an ipad.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I saw this film bubbling over with enthusiasm.  About halfway in, the disappointment had set in so deep that at that point, I was just waiting for the credits to roll so I could slink out of the theater.  This film is terrible.  I say this as a huge fan the genre, and of both Alien and Aliens.  It breaks one of the most important rules of story-telling: it doesn't make sense.  You have to start suspension of disbelief right out the gate as a nonsensical opening sequence starts the head-scratching race.  Let's break it down thusly (heavy spoilers):<br /><br />1) The story starts with the a lot of quiet scenes of the android, alone, trying to entertain himself while he tends to the suspended animation tanks holding the Prometheus' crew.  If this assemblage of scenes seems familiar, that's because it is one of the first of several gratuitous references to the first movie.<br /><br />2) We see actor Guy Pierce (Memento) making an appearance via pre-recorded hologram as a long dead scientist financier of the mission.  Despite the fact they point out the hologram was recorded prior to his death, throughout the scene he looks at the scientists seated before him.  I'll add that they bury Guy Pierce beneath what is really some of the absolutely worst old-man makeup I've ever seen.  It's so bad that it takes you out the movie for a moment.  I mean, it's like Saturday Night Live quality.  I've seen better makeup jobs on episodes of The X-Files.  I guess they busted the budget elsewhere.<br /><br />3) This is a crew of what we are told are scientists/researchers/specialists who travel into deep space to visit an alien planet.  They illogically launch an expedition on the eve of a major storm, geared up in all sorts of protective gear.  They enter what they believe to be a series of caves and tunnels and react to this by promptly removing their protective breathing gear because, you know, the sensors say the atmosphere is breathable.  Now we know the atmosphere on an airplane isbreathable too, including all the aerosolized flu virus the passenger behind you just sneezed into the air.  Apparently alien virus cooties do not concern this crew.  They soon encounter strange alien artifacts covered with black alien goop.  They react to this by promptly removing their protective gloves and begin to handle it with their bare hands.  (Palm slaps the forehead)<br /><br />4) The android poisons one of the crew members with some of the alien goop he surreptitiously lifted from the caves.  No clear reason is given for this.  Allusion is that it is in furtherance of a plot-twist that most viewers will see coming ten miles away.  The poisoned scientist impregnates his girlfriend with an alien baby (because the goop he's poisoned with makes him impregnate women with alien spawn of course)--a move that is another one of several gratuitous references to the original films.  I'm sorry I gotta ask.  Was this impregnation by design?  And if so, how did the android know the two lovebirds were going to get busy?  Did he hear Barry White music wafting from their sleeping quarters?<br /><br />5) Upon realizing she is impregnated with alien spawn the girlfriend \\"takes care of it\\" using a self-surgery machine introduced earlier in the film as being designed for male use only.  She over-rides quite easily which begs the question:  What was the point in mentioning that it was for male use only, after which that entire plot point is dispensed with in service of artificially induced dramatic tension?  If it being male-use only wasn't going to be an actual obstacle, why have it in there in the first place?  Why not just give her a conveniently located surgery machine in the off chance you have to pull an alien embryo out of your body?  At the conclusion of this scene old man Guy Pearce reappears except now (ta-da) he's not really dead, he's alive, a secret that had been hidden from the crew.  Why is this a secret?  At this point, you won't care.  More non-making sense will follow.<br /><br />6) While exploring the caves the scientists get separated and one of them dies via an alien snake/squid/tentacle thingy.  The other \\"scientists\\" bring the decapitated head of a dead alien onboard the ship because, you know,as scientist they're of course all concerned about containment, hygiene, sterilization, etc.  So yeah, bring the dead alien head onboard.<br /><br />7) Charlize Theron spends the entire film looking frigid and severe, then unexpectedly decides to have sex with the captain of the ship. This #1 happens off camera and #2 does nothing in service of the plot.<br /><br />8) One of the scientist left back in the caves dramatically reappears just outside the spaceship except now he's an alien super-hulk monster.  So we got weird alien baby embryo, alien goop, porcelain-skinned giant space aliens, and super-hulk aliens.  Keeping count?<br /><br />9) We finally realize that the alien caves the Prometheus has been painstakeningly tracking with little cool red tracker things--scenes we revisit about 50 times as the movies progresses--finally shows us the big reveal. It's not a cave, it's an alien spaceship!  I've never seen that plot device before, \\"cough-cough\\" Empire Strikes Back \\"cough.\\"<br /><br />10) Old man Guy Pearce, the android, and Noomi Rapace head back into what we now know is a alien spaceship.  The android revives one of the sleeping giant aliens.  The alien immediately starts killing everyone including ripping off the androids head, revealing copious amounts of plastic tubing veins and milk-blood.  I'm glad I've never seen an Alien movie android ripped open before.  Having never seen a ripped open Android made finally seeing it a real surprise.  If I'd seen that before in a prior movie it would have been a let-down.  Then the giant alien starts piloting his spaceship (which he drives with a flute...yes a flute) on a mission to travel to Earth to wipe us out for good because I guess they didn't get it right last time.  Themovie theorizes the aliens created us and want to destroy us now.  This makes no sense to the crew and less sense to audience.  You know you have problems when the characters IN the movie struggle with the plot.  Noomi escapes the ship just as it launches into the air.  The Prometheus crew, upon being warned via radio that the ship is headed to Earth, immediately decide to ram the spaceship with their own ship, killing themselves in the process. They make this decision immediately.  After the ramming, the gigantic ship comes falling out of the sky, hits the ground butt first, and begin falling in gigantic slow motion like a giant space croissant.  Noomi is in danger of being smashed as this thing looms over her.  She can simply run to her left or right, side-stepping the falling craft.  Or she can run in a straight line, leaving her in the impact zone of the craft as it falls through the air.  What does she do?  Of course, she runs in a straight line, the giant ship finally crashing to the ground inches behind her heels.<br /><br />In summary, some more stuff happens in these final minutes of the film.  And the stuff that happens is dumb.  Very dumb. Groan inducing dumb.  It also tries to play the \\"If you don't get the story, then this movies is too smart for you\\" card.  But in reality, you won't get this movie because it's sense of logic is ethereal at best.  At worst, it's an expensive mess with a neon sign above it blaring \\"Style over Substance Sold Here!\\"  This is why I think this movie happened.  First, it's Ridley Scott and he wanted to do an alien movie.  Nuff said (almost).  And I'm sure Ridley Scott and his production shop worked up some fantastic concept art for this film.  Indeed, the film looks incredible if not quite ground-breaking as Blade Runner or Alien.  The set-design is impeccable with an organic, lived in look that makes the sterile CGI worlds Lucas created for the Star War prequels look like cartoons.  So I think Scott said, I'm gonna make this flick look cool.  As for the story, he through a couple of hundred grand at some script writers and said, \\"I want a chest bursting scene and at least one android ripped apart, aside from that, I don't care.\\"  Well folks, in Prometheus, that's exactly what you get:  A very cool looking movie, a chest bursting scene, a ripped apart android, and a bunch of I don't care.  The trailer for this film was a excellent.  Watch that instead and do something else with the 120 mins you save yourself.
B0090EKRKU|2.0|The movie itself was good, but I ordered the HD version and that is not what I received.  The imagery was very grainy and at times froze.  I don't know if I would go with HD agin through streaming.  Movie was good though.

B005OP7162|4.0|Season 2 of Revenge was quickly approaching, so ABC ran this 3 episode mini marathon in hopes of drumming up more fans. I caught the pilot, an explosive episode from the middle of the season, and then the finale. I really liked it so I went to Amazon.com and immediately purchased the season on Amazon Instant Video. This is my first experience with AIV, and I loved it. The convenience of making a purchase online and then watching it on my TV was amazing! And the show was great too. Revenge was full of twists and turns and wonderful acting from the leads. There are a few annoying characters (Ashley, Tyler) but it evens out with some great ones (Nolan, Victoria). It's my new guilty pleasure - and I'm tuning in for Season 2!

B007MB5OCE|4.0|I loved this book.  From the moment Allan climbs out the window, there is fun and adventures.  It is almost a Swedish version of Forest Gump in that the main character meets so many of the world leaders in his 100 years.  It is a delightful escape from reality.  Except for the death by elephant scene, I felt that the elephant was not needed in this comedy.  Still, each scene leads to the next with bated expectation and wonderment.  It is a great book to read over a quiet weekend.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Angry birds is a lot of fun to play, and is very challenging and sometimes frustrating too.  It really makes you want to get each step,and move on to the next one. I usually take my Kendall Fire on trips when I fly, and the time,(just like a bird) flies.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Love this cover. Love, love, love it! It's simplistic. It's relative. It's original. Love, love, love it!<br /><br />So first let me begin by saying Oh sweet mini batman, this story rocked! It reminded me majorly of a favorite anime, Sailor Moon, which made sense seeing how apparently the author is a fan of the pretty soldiers (if you're a true fan you would understand). For that alone, Meyer is a new favorite. I feel like we would be great bosom buddies if only we could meet.. or skype. Needless to say, I feel like stalking, at least until book two comes out which looks just was awesome as Cinder. Oops, I'm getting ahead of myself! Let's get back to my review of Cinder!<br /><br />So the plot itself was obviously great. I mean, common, five stars? That's a perfect score and the reason for that perfect five stars is the mind numbingly diamond of a story. I have NEVER come across a plot quite like this. It's futuristic, it's fantasy, it's romance, it's all rolled up into one heart bursting ball of amazing. The world was so foreign and yet so well formulated that I didn't have any awkward distancing from it. A good book sucks you into it's story, a great book makes you live it. Cinder is obviously a great book. How could I think anything different, when Meyer delivered a cyborg Cinderella?<br /><br />As for Meyer's writing, yeah no lack there. The whole book was on par with my favorites and perhaps landed a little higher in my esteem with the fact that Meyer was obviously not afraid to go THERE. She showed a real world, ugly and beautiful in the pages of her book. Meyer hit just the right balance in her descriptions to show and not tell what was happening in the pages of Cinder. For that alone, I am in awe of her writing powers.<br /><br />As for the characters, yeah there is that awe again. Meyer did a superb job at the people introduced. First is Cinder, the main character and who happens to be a cyborg. Her life is no Disney story either. It is sad and complex, shaping Cinder's character into someone worth wanting to read about. What's more, Cinder herself was no wilting miss. She didn't expect saving and though she held a lack of confidence in her importance as a person, that quirk was needed for this book.<br /><br />As for the second main character, Prince Kai. I must say, he's just slightly less interesting. I find him more on the mellow side of things but still very realistic. He's aware of his shortcomings and worries about failing. He fights with his anger and grief, and Meyer did a fantastic job at showing this. Meyer's obviously excelled at creating a rainbow of people in her book which heightens the story in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Overall, Cinder was a fabulous read. I kept putting it off thinking I wouldn't care for it and boy am I feeling silly. The originality of this story literally floors me and my only upset is that the sequel to this series doesn't get published until February of 2013. Now that I've reminded myself of that, I think I'm going to go off and cry over the injustice of the wait.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Music CD is as great as the movie.  I would recommend watching the movie first, then you can visualize the scenes with the music.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was an excellent book! I absolutely love all of Rick Riordan's books! All of his mythology books, Olympians and Egyptians alike, have helped me out in school immensely. The Mark of Athena was no disappointment whatsoever. We finally see Percy and Annabeth reunited, and as a real couple for the first time. There are tons of new mythological creatures and characters, and we see the difference in the Greek and Roman aspects of the gods a lot better than we have in the past. The story moved along amazingly. My only complaint is waiting a year for the next one, which is truly the mark of an excellent book and story. Everyone should absolutely read this book!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending to a great book! Never thought that this book would interest me the way it did. Didn't find it the least bit pornographic the way some people described it. It was tastefully done, it seemed like I was reading a case study on someone's life with input from various people.
0316228532|5.0|Rowling's writing style has matured. Her goals as an author, too, have come a long way.<br /><br />This is a book of startling ambition and one of the most nuanced portrayals of how the most casual, unthinking acts can have phenomenally far-reaching effects, both wonderful and horrible. I hardly expected this from Rowling. I've often thought of the Harry Potter series as wonderfully plotted, with a decently-built (though tenuous when tested) world. But this is far more.<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews. They're wrong. Just don't go in expecting Harry Potter without magic; this book is very little like Harry Potter, and that's a good thing.
B004HO6I4M|1.0|Item was supposed to be 'new'.  It has so many scratches on it, we can't watch it.  No instructions how to return or get our money back.
0071762345|5.0|Almost finished this book. It is a good read and puts things into perspective.Would recommend it to others looking to work in the social relm.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well I'm impressed! Never expected this series to capture my interest the way it has. Christian is one fascinating character. I don't want to ruin it for the readers who haven't read it yet, but if you're into learning and not being judgemental these books teach alot. This is really a love story about two people who learn to love uncondionally while having some exciting sex. You have to look beyond the physical and see all the sides of the main characters. If you can do this then you'll not put these books down until you have read the last page!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I love Ken Follet novels and the first novel in this series was brilliant. I think the best word to describe this sequel is, \\"contrived.\\"<br /><br />I found Maud Von Ulrich's devotion to her husband as the reason for staying in Nazi Berlin a ludicrous reason for not leaving the country, perhaps because we know what happens to Germany at that time, but it does seem counter to her personality. After all, she abandoned her friendship with Ethel in the first novel just for a minor political difference in women's suffrage. Remaining devoted to Germany when the country was turning to fascism seems a far stretch, especially when she exclaims to her daughter in the first chapter, \\"What kind of world did I bring you into?\\"<br /><br />I groaned as the Dewar family and their significant others landed in Honolulu on December 6, 1941, and predictably had a scheduled tour of battleship row from the water on the morning of December 7th. That was such a stretch, I nearly put this novel away, but plowed on. Without giving anything away, just know that when you read this novel, you will come across one contrivance after another to the point of being ridiculous. Granted, this is historical fiction, but it really stretches you to believe that these families could possibly be as interwoven into such major historical events of the WWII era.<br /><br />There are good moments though, but overall, this sequel was disappointing.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love this book as much as I loved the first one. It picks up shortly where the first one ended. My only slight criticism would be that Follett doesn't do enough to remind you of the characters in the beginning of the book.  It took me a while to remember them, but after about 50 pages I caught up.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Child presses the right buttons,it's always a page turner.<br />Reacher gets into some extreme situations that can be a little over the top but I still enjoy reading it.
0385344333|1.0|I want my money back! Big Reacher fan..read all fifteen books. Fire the ghost writer and banish him to an uninhabited island.
B008J34466|5.0|I ordered this CD and was afraid I would like a couple of songs and not \\"get\\" the rest. WRONG! Love the whole thing!
0316228532|4.0|I liked this book mainly for the character development.  Rowling does a thoughtful job of examining a small groups of people and the enmeshments that snarl their lives.  The events following the death of a counsel man, and the efforts of these people to deal with his absence, set the novel a task of explicating how these people come together.  I think a good job was done in exploring the difference between the public persona and the actual thought and circumstances of each character,  I especially like Krystal, the bad girl, whose genuine love for her brother goes largely unknown, as she becomes vilified as both \\"a duty and a pleasure\\" except by those who came to know her.  The implausible elements of some of the ending are the the only setbacks to five stars.  This novel stands up to the hype, and I wasn't disappointed.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Great and quick service on a good dvd..
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|great read, enjoyed it I had to read in 9 hrs, typically Lee Child special. Always satisfied after reading about Jack
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am in utter shock and amazement about this book. Ms. Sylvia has done it again. There aren't enough coherent words that I can form to complete a review. But I will say IT IS A MUST READ! I am more in LOVE with Gideon, then I was in the first book. Seriously, this book is mouth dropping fan-flippin-tastic! 5+++++++++ Stars!!!!
B004W4N55C|2.0|Great app on my phone, but does not work on Nexus 7. Would give it 5 stars otherwise. Very easy to use' and I like that it has pinch to zoom
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this app has the best/most realistic sounds as well as the best variety of sounds. it even has dryer and air  conditioner if thats your thing. it also has great options like saving favs and changing all the different layers' volume. i have never owned or used a sound machine before and im 22. but this changed my mind. highly reccomend.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have to say that if there is one CD that everyone should own out there....it is The PianoGuys.  This CD is amazing.  What group out there combines pop music with Classical music.  Wait until you subscribe to their Channel on YouTube.  My favorite part about this CD is imagining all of the videos that have been created for each Song.  You learn the history behind the song, such as One Republic's Secrets or A Thousand Years and then you listen to the music over and over.  Honestly, after I learned where A thousand Years came from I listened to that song for two weeks straight.  Every song on this cd describes creativity, pure talent, innovation, excitement, and of course beautiful inspiring music.
B007US9NA8|5.0|I'm not missing anything in this entire book. That says a lot when it's said about an encyclopedia! Arnold is still the boss.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|A great season (it did got better towards the end).<br />Personally one of my favorite episodes ever is TRILOGY time, which sort of makes you think about your own life (while seeing the evolution n changes thru your favorite character life)<br /><br />The Bro Code and more get you into an hilarious universe.<br /><br />Awesome series! It does turn you into a happy mood =)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The whole family loves it. Only wish I could earn points faster.Some games are not so much fun but Ok.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I first came across this book, and looked at the reviews - over 1800 as of October 1, I simply could not believe it to be true. How wrong I was.  I've been an avid SCI-FI reader for over a quarter of a century and I say with no exaggeration that this is one of the very best books I've ever read.  I finished it in two days and literally could not put it down.<br /><br />I want more - much more - please write more! I want to know what happens to Silo 17! I want to know about all the other Silo's!<br /><br />Buy this book, read it, and fall in love with arguably one of the greatest sci-fi authors of our time!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Without giving anything away I do wonder, like many other women do, when did I become my mother?  Eva certainly displayed in this book many characteristics that she did not appreciate in her own mother.  I think Book 3 can't come out soon enough for me.  I actually reread Bared to You before embarking on Book 2.  Much darker than 50 Shades I think, Eva not as juvenile as Ana but there are times she makes you remember that 24 isn't all that grown up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzzane Collins did a great job, mocking jay  is a must read.<br />I gave 5 stars for suspense.Great book. Thanks
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|\\"puny God. \\" This movie was so funny. I love and have always loved marvel comics and especially the justice league and the avengers(dc, ml). I can't wait til they make a dc movie and also bring in new characters like flash,x-men, wonderwoman , batman,spiderman,green lantern, and superman. Not only was this film well made with awesome graphics and special effects but I just found it very amusing and humurous. I am glad that put so much humor in this. It was just an overall fun flick. This would be a great movie to buy but i know they will play it alot on basic cable in like 2 years so I'll wait until then. I don't really have anything negative to say other than it'd be great to see the avenger more \\"super\\" i know the hulk can't die, and iron man is protected,  but it'd be nice to see captain america and the others more \\"superhuman.\\" Also it'd be great to see them really have the best costumes designers can make especially to show off black widows form (scarlet J.). I'm glad they had cobie smulders in there because every one loves her from \\"how i met your mother.\\"  As a last thought i did see this in theatres in 3d. I like it a lot better without 3d. Just my opinion.I am just ranting here but anyway the movie was great , 5 stars, i can't wait for the upcoming sequels to the avengers/superhero team! Godbless Bravo! Well done!<br /><br />~shauns movie review
B005CZQ9I0|5.0|I was very pleased to listen  to this recording.  It's true her voice  doesn't have the incredible power she had when she was younger,<br />but she still knows how to sell a song even though with a softer tone. Also she was smart in choosing the songs of Alan and Marylyn<br />Bergman. They fit her perfectly and no one presents a song like Barbra!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am about half way through the Winter of the World, and thoroughly enjoy it.  The text picks up the storyline with the rise of the Nazi party in 1935 and reintroduces the reader to the now older children of most of the primary characters.  Without providing any spoilers, Follett acurately portrays Berlin, London, and New York society during the pre-war era, introducing a number of familiar entities and creating a believeable flow of action as his characters interact with true historical events.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|A great way to waist lots of time. Reminds me of my childhood and the arcade. My kids love it.  I don't like how long it takes to regenerate coins
B008B11RLQ|5.0|Brian, I didn't think you were reviewing this product fairly.  Just because you're an avid Elvis collector and already have all these albums doesn't speak to whether this is a good collection of good music with good quality sound.  I, unlike you, only have one of these albums.  20 full length Elvis albums for less than three dollars each is a great value for those of us who do not already have a shelf full of Elvis.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Since receiving this CD it has got me hooked for hours and listening to songs over and over. It is filled with songs that evoke numerous emotions and thoughts. At times I'm bouncing around with Got My Mind Set On You, then switch to My Sweet Lord. This review may be a tad biased due to I love this CD but a simple message I want to express is you will not be disappointed.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very enjoyable read.  The level of detail explained about being on the ground in Iraq is very educational and provides insight to what our soldiers today have to endure
1410429385|1.0|I have read 4 books of this author and they all are pretty much the same.  The good guy rides into the little unknown town, a little old lady needs help,  the bad guys ask the good guy to get out of their town and the good guy starts beating the hell out of the bad guys.  This is getting boring, so I am done with Mr.  Lee child.  I feel once you read one, the rest are pretty much the same.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is good for kindle fire and it is fun game and awesome and acool game and fun its fun
B004YM6JI2|4.0|Originally conceived to have a 5 year arc this series is still around in its eighth season. Although it began life as a buddy buddy brother roadtrip kind of show as the years have gone on it has become darker and more philosophical. Dean and Sam are beer swilling junk food gulping good old boys. Although they  rarely remove their shirts to show off, how they maintain those trim physiques given their diet and lifestyle is one of the show's mysteries along with the other imponderables: how they race around the countryside without getting any speeding tickets, fake all those FBI Passes and rarely get caught using them, keep hiding that arsenal of weapons, afford and maintain those immaculately pressed suits they wear when impersonating the FBI. Most at home in denim and plaid despite sleeping in those clothes in that speeding car they never seem to look rumpled or sweaty. At 6' 4' Sam does not buy those jeans off the rack. In one episode last Season Sam was shown shirtless performing a workout worthy of any bodybuilder.<br /><br />Given the sibling rivalry shown on screen one wonders what Jensen Ackles thinks of Jared Padalecki getting top billing in the show's credits. Although Dean is the older brother on screen and in real life having him call Sam who towers over him his little brother is amusing. Both grew up in Texas a state where guns are a way of life. The violence and gore factor belie the fact that this show is more popular with women than men. As the series budget increased with its popularity the creatures and special effects become more sophisticated.<br /><br />I thought the season began weakly but it improved as it progressed. Getting hooked on a series such as this is not about believing the preposterous storylines because they're so outrageous they defy suspension of disbelief. This is about becoming attached to Sam and Dean and wanting to see how they get themselves out of their latest scrape. In the end their situation is hopeless and its resolution would spell the end of the series.ould spell the end of the series.
0425263908|1.0|I was really hoping I would like this book because I really enjoying the 50 shades series..but I found this book to be way to predictable and too vulgar.  The way the main female character talks/thinks is way over board and too dirty.  I found nothing special in the book, and def nothing that made me wanting more.  I had to push myself to finish the book, I kept hoping it would calm down and get better...
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I was a little hesitant to make this purchase, half expecting a single-name wannabe type who got lucky with another group.  I was wrong.  This is a very good CD with a variety of sounds and depth of songs.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|One word:  Dissapointing.<br />I have been WAITING for this day to come and waiting for the sequel.  I loved Bared to You.  I read it this summer on the heels of the whole Shades of Grey series, and it helped fill that \\"Christian Grey\\" void for me.  The love story between Gideon and Eva had such promise.  Then, a few chapters into this book....bam, it was over for me.  I spent ¾ of the book waiting for it to get better.  The early part of the book goes over (in my opinon) way too many fine details that were covered in the 1st book.  The colors of his apartment, the entrance of his building.  Rather than taking a story that had promise of two broken souls trying to learn to love and grow together, Syvia Day successfully turns Gideon into a character who is very unlikeable.  In this book, he seems to have one need for Eva, and one need only.  And I'm not squeamish about love scenes in a book, but my gosh.  I was like--enough already.  Yes, we get it...he NEEDS her, he can't breathe without her..but he's absent of being able to show that love in any other way.  I think the author really missed an opportunity there, even before the \\"big event\\" (I won't ruin it) which happens in the book which in the end, we find out WHY Gideon pushes Eva away as harshly as he does.  I understood then why he had to keep her at bay for so long, but that still doesn't explain the massive cold jerk (for a G rated amazon-acceptable word) he was before \\"the event\\".  You would think for a man so obsessed with a woman, he would have treated her with more respect than that, and moreso--SHE would have wanted it!!  The final 3 chapters started to redeem this book.  FINALLY the answers.  But by that point, I felt like after a slow slow slow walk for 300+ pages, we were sprinting toward the finish line of resolution.  I would have liked to see some of this spread out more in in the latter half of the book vs cramming into the last 30 pages.  And it does give me a glimmer of hope that maybe Ms. Daywill parlay that good storyline/ending forward in her final book in this series.  The Gideon we know seems to be back....it's where she takes him for another 400 pages in book 3 that will determine my final opinion of everything.  There is DEFINITELY potential--don't disappoint us again!!
B00013M6NK|5.0|Hi thanks for the nikon EN-EL5 I received it in record time. I was truely amazed at the speed you sent it to me. I put it yo use asap, and it is working just fine.
0143119680|2.0|I had such high hopes for this book when I first started it. The first 150 pages or so set up what seems like it's going to be an incredibly interesting story with dynamic characters and a dash of history. Unfortunately, the setup never pays off. The characters become these simpering creatures that spend the next 400 pages whining on about how much they love and need to take care of each other. In summary, no one likes both the main characters. Every other character in the book only likes one of the two and it seems like so many pages are dedicated to making sure the reader is totally and inescapably aware of this fact. Also, while I know this book is part of a trilogy, the story doesn't seem to go anywhere. Other trilogies that I've read have stories within each book, with an overall thread that links the three books together. This is not the case here. It is one giant preview for what I can only assume is the next two books in the series. I was so disappointed by this book because I enjoyed the exposition so much. At almost 600 pages, it's also a bit of a time investment as well and I was frustrated by endless descriptions of the female lead being whisked off to bed by her vampire boyfriend and having millions of pots of tea fixed for her because she is constantly cold and fragile and sad etc. etc. Yet, at the same time we are supposed to believe that she is this incredible savior type person with a backbone of steel. Ultimately, the book is engaging and starts off well, and is so much more disappointing in the end for it than if it had been wholly terrible. I actually think the problems in this particular novel are more a problem of editing than anything else. If 200 pages on tea-making had been sliced right out of it, perhaps it would have been less frustrating. The most annoying part is that I'm almost tempted to read the second book in the series just because I was so irritated by the lack of payoff in this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love the game. It is nicely addictive.  I love that I don't have to play it all day to get somewhere. My biggest complaint is that at a certain point in the game you need a lot of nuts to finish your families and unfortunately if you don't wanna buy them they are really hard to come by. Now I have a lot of money but nothing to buy with it and I would need a lot of nuts to finish my families. And nuts is what I don't have. :(
B008469DGY|5.0|Love to play. Loaded to both my phone and tablet. highly recommended. Will give you hours of fun and a break to enjoy the wonderful scenery.
B0091574VI|2.0|This is a great story, and very moving. But it isn't nearly the movie I expected. It feels like Meerkat Manor more than a feature length movie production - with voices (unknown) letting us know what the various characters are thinking and feeling. And for younger children, it is definitely too slow-moving and dry to hold their attention. My five and three year olds will watch most movies all the way through - especially my five year-old who devours movies. But this just didn't hold their attention and barely held my attention.  I was honestly disappointed.
0486282112|5.0|Mary Shelley;s Frankenstein is a masterpiece. Thus it has stood the test of time and is taught in schools even today. The story is profound with themes of bravery, adventure, unrealistic human aspirations and fundamental questions about good and evil. The most amazing thing to me, however, regarding the book, is that it was written decades ago by a teenager who was stranded in a house during a freezing winter is Switzerland. The book was actually written on a dare, \\"While we've nothing else to do, let's write a ghost story, the best one wins.\\" (I'm paraphrasing of course). But essentially this is what happened and the result was this profound, spiritual horror story about the aspirations of a man trying to be God with an inevitable but interesting Shakespearean ending of tragedy. There are lessons to be learned from this book. Profound lessons, and how a teenager, especially a female teenager could create such a masterpiece establishes that the human capacity for imagination and teaching in the context of a novel is something that simply can not be denied. It's sad that modern literature seems to lack this soaring imagination, originality of form and inevitable conclusions of right and wrong which beam brightly from this outstanding work of fiction. This book should be required reading for all English speaking people and perhaps for all people across the world. I give it the highest recommendation possible.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this is a really good game with a good mystery story and history behind it, i am looking forward for part 2. This game was definitely worth. 99 cents

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVED Reflected in You! It took me only a few hours to read it as I couldn't put it down. It was even better and hotter than Bared to You!! I LOVE Gideon and Eva even with all their dysfunctional ways, lol!! This book had me on such an emotional roller coaster ride it was driving me crazy and I loved it! So many twists and turns and it kept me wanting more and more!! I can't wait to see how you close out this series!! Thank you Sylvia for the AWESOME book!!
B00846F1YW|3.0|I like the game but it is to sensitive.  If I tryto enlarge the screen it says I randomly am searching.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book read it in one day. It was a good story all around just like everything by nicholas sparks. Wish it had ended different but I loved the whole book and I have already reccommended it as soon as I finished it.
B008LZHA3G|2.0|Well, perhaps 'disappointment' isn't quite correct. For every album the man makes that I enjoy there are five I can't stand, so my expectations are never really very high with Dylan. Lyrically, he may still be a force to be reckoned with, but musically this album is woeful. Mostly major-key, overlong, and an indulgent affair, it is a very far cry from gems like 'Planet Waves', 'Blood on the Tracks', 'Oh Mercy' and 'Time out of Mind'.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Everytime I use this App for pinterest on my Kindle fire,  I keep getting the pop up message..&quot;App not responding- wait or force close&quot;. It's very annoying and needs to be addressed! It's very frustrating when it happens like every 2 minutes. Love Pinterst....not liking this App.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I couldn't wait to finish it.  I cannot wait for the 3rd book.  It sucks that I have to wait until 12-31-12.  I just want to continue the story now!

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|That is all! Just wanted to say I loved it and give it the 5 stars it deserves! Yep. It was good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I do not understand why the government is flipping out about this book when it seems to not reveal much to us. That being said I thought this book was a very great read, and very informative. You get to have a good understand of what goes on in the life of a Navy Seal. You can sense his fear during his situations, his stresses and even more so the humor that they have within the military life. He writes this book like a normal person just putting his thoughts on paper, and not trying to really prove any major point other then to open your eyes to what happened during his time in service and more so what happened the night Bin Laden died. Deff not a difficult read and very enjoyable.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this book to come out and was not disappointed at all. I love the story and cannot wait to see what happens next with Gideon and Eva.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This has really been helpful for me. I take my phone or laptop to class, take notes.. and those notes are then on my phone and computer to review whenever I have a spare minute. Certainly handy for a college student
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Although The Time Keeper got off to a bit of a rocky start, once it got going I could not put it down. What a marvelous story! When I finished, the tears were running down my cheeks. The book conveys a message that we all need to embrace.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I was thrilled when I found \\"The Monster at the End of this Book\\" available for Kindle!  I can remember my little sister reading the Little Golden Book version over and over again...now my 2 sons can do the same thing on my tablet. The story is simple and helps kids realize that sometimes the things they are afraid of are really nothing scary at all.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really liked this book, but it was clearly the middle book. I liked the first one so much! It wasn't as emotionally pleasing as the first book and (hopefully) the final book will be. I would REALLY have liked more resolution for individual issues in this book. My only real criticisms are that it was a touch scattered with so many different ups and downs, I would have liked more scenes that were as emotionally charged that had resolutions as the first book, and that the third book isn't available yet!! ;)<br /><br />I actually don't have a beef with what some readers do regarding his actions about the stepbrother. I mean this is foction. I just found it a bit bizarre and unbelievable that he was doing it all for the good.<br /><br />I admit that I think the author walked a bit to close to making me dislike the relationship for her. But, it's fiction. Well written and well characterized fiction.<br /><br />I look forward to the third book!!  I want to rehash the whole I deceived you and it hurt you stuff then, though. I need the satisfaction of seeing them work through that.
B0068AWO00|1.0|Dsiappointing.  Loved the original.  The only part that got my attention was Chris Saradon's cameo. They had such a wealth of material.  Hollywood needs to stop making remakes!!!!
B004EPZ03Y|1.0|I used to love the Muppets. However, after seeing this awful movie, I feel like watching the old ones again, which I haven't done in years. Maybe I used to love crap or maybe the Muppet movies used to be great and now all they could come up with was this stupid piece of junk. What's with all that ridiculous singing and dancing?
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just finished reading it and it was good!  I think I like it better than Bared.  please don't make us wait long for the 3rd book!
0525953728|5.0|This is a very good book that I have now read from cover to cover. I could see no earth-shaking classified information in it, no more that what the W.H. & staff has alreay released. It gives a good inside look into the minds and training of our fine Navy SEALS and armed forces.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a while. It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, I was unable to put it down. I recommend it!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Really like the case.  Well made and appreciate the way the case stands on horizontal...just wish that it would have also had the ability to stand vertical.  Also wish that it had the auto wake/sleep attribute but you get what you pay for and I'm very satisfied with the quality of what we got.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Excellent Movie! I was excited that production companies are now selling packages that not only include Blu-Ray and DVD plus Digital Download, but now they also include Blu-Ray 3D and the Theatrical Music as well!  Great deal for $20!
B00932A2MC|5.0|The movie is a great movie the action, the graphics, the story is great and I all ready bought it on blu ray after watching it online. I recommend this to all my friends and the loved it also. SO GO CHECK OT PUT ALREADY!!!!
B002ZTQVBQ|2.0|I very nearly tossed the disc, ala frisbee style after being unable to switch to Japanese audio.  Only French or American dubs on the Blu-Ray. And the American dub is NOT good.  There are a few good voice over roles, but the instant Ponyo starts talking, it's like nails on a chalkboard.  So I wanted to hear the original Japanese.  Hum...<br /><br />So I checked the box, and it listed Japanese audio for the 2nd disc.  DVD.  Not Blu-Ray.  Hum...  So then I put that disc in.  And found that I could not switch automatically to the Japanese.  I had to go through several menus, then restart the film.  Then skip manually to the chapter I wanted.  Then the subtitles were off (knowing quite a bit of Japanese, this was obvious), so luckily I was able to put the correct subtitles on (instead of captions).<br /><br />A one star rating is kind of harsh, but I balanced the rating out to two stars.  It really deserves one star because:<br /><br />YOU CANNOT WATCH PONYO ON BLU-RAY WITH THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE AUDIO!!!!<br /><br />So that makes getting the Blu-Ray version of Ponyo a huge mistake for purists or true foreign film aficionados.  The other reason that I gave a one star rating is that the film isn't good enough to warrant raising the star rating.  I would give the film 3 stars normally if not for the huge slap in the face to those of us wanting Blu-Ray quality with the lossless Japanese audio.  Being a huge fan of Miyazaki, I can see that perhaps his creativity began running in a different direction in the end.  This was his last directed film, and though it was a decent film, even the newer Ghibli film Arietty (written by Miyazaki but not directed by) was much better.  It's not a bad film, just Miyazaki's weakest link.  Compared to his other masterpieces: Nasuicaa, Totoro, Laputa (Castle in the Sky), Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle, one can safely say this film falls short compared to all of these.<br /><br />It's a film about love and friendship, and it seems to start as a film against humanity's pollution of the seas.  But this never really pans out other than a few early shots.  It's the lack of depth that is the problem; the deeper and more complex stories are what raised the bar of his previous films.  In the end, Totoro is probably the most complex film with the subtle and hidden meanings which remind me of Spirit of the Beehive and Pan's Labrynth (and better than Pan's I think).  Kiki might have more in common with Ponyo than the other films do, but even Kiki has a little more to it, and more likable characters.<br /><br />The animation was stunning.  I liked that Miyazaki wanted to go back to colorful, hand drawn animation with storybook looking backgrounds.  This was a huge plus.  But the positives can't outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />Film - 3 stars<br />Failing to include the lossless Japanese audio on the Blu-Ray - 1 star<br /><br />If you want to see the Japanese audio, then save money and get the DVD only.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|This has been my weather outlet of choice on my PC, my iPhone and until recently my Fire.  Over the last few months, it has stopped updating regularly.  I was seeing two or three day old forecasts, requiring me to manually stop the app and delete stored data to get an update.  I finally got tired of it and uninstalled.  It's a shame, because otherwise this is a great app.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Do not ruin this great movie by watching the preview.  It is just a great funny movie.  I was fortunate to just watch without seeing the trailer and LOVED IT.  One of my top comedies of the last 10 years.  Note, I do not like the \\"younger\\" comedies like superbad or hot rod.  I do enjoy Hangover, American Pie, Due Date, Zombieland.  Just enjoy this great movie.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Installed this as a replacement for Weather Channel's app. I like the presentation and the frequency of updates, but using the weather map caused my Fire to freeze almost every time I used it.

B001DCZ4IW|5.0|A dear friend recommended this to me, and I must say it is a must see. Especially for those of us who can appreciate \\"weird\\" movies. Words cannot do this movie justice, you just have to see it. Great acting, great story, great music.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book 2 of the Crossfire Trilogy exceeds all expectations! It is explosive, intense, gripping, and gut wrenching. The love story is heartbreaking; and the main characters, Gideon and Eva, are tortured, damaged beyond measure, and far from perfect, but you can't help but feel for them, ache for them, and root for them. I love Eva's gutsiness and tenacity; and while I question some of Gideon's choices, I also understand them and am willing to forgive them because he truly has Eva's best interest at heart and would do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, for and protect her. With their ugly pasts and hideous baggage, they cannot help but hurt each other repeatedly, but they also fight for one another with tooth and nail, because they recognize how invaluable and extraordinary the love they share is.<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting and all I want to do now is to go back and read it all over again. Can't wait for the 3rd and final book, Entwined with You to be released! If anybody has any doubt as to whether this is worth a read, don't! If you are looking for a great, larger-than-life love story that will shake you to the core, this is it!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|\\"If I lose you, Eva, ... I have nothing. Everything I've done is so I don't lose you.\\"<br /><br />I have never so anxiously awaited for a sequel like I have for this one. It is no understatement when I say that I was literally counting down the hours to its release date, desperately clinging onto the little snippets that the author fed us along the way. And, for me, it was definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon's relationship is still relatively in its early stages. Their love for each other is all-consuming, possessive, raw, almost primal in so many ways - they constantly crave each other's touch, presence, affection. The intensity of their connection might make it appear like they have been together for a while but the issues before them are those of a new couple. Trust is their biggest hurdle at this point, giving rise to endless scenes of jealousy and bouts of self-doubt. Their insecurities make them explosive with one another, violently addicted to each other and yet endlessly passionate.<br /><br />  \\"Most couples didn't spend every free moment together, but we weren't like most people. We both had hang-ups, insecurities, and an addiction to each other that required regular contact to keep us functioning properly. I hated being apart from him. I rarely went more than a couple of hours without thinking of him. ... We were together because we were addicted to each other. I was never as intoxicated as I was when we were happy together, and I knew it was the same for him. We were putting ourselves through the wringer for those moments of perfection between us, but they were so tenuous that only our stubbornness, determination, and love kept us fighting for them.\\"<br /><br />But their story is definitely not a Hallmark movie. It does not take a psychiatrist to see how unhealthy their almost-symbiotic relationship really is. We see all its faults, all its destructive streaks, and yet we can't help ourselves from wanting to give them their happy ending. We want them to make it, to overcome their hideous pasts and mend their broken souls. In any other scenario, we would be cringing at some of their interactions, but when it comes to Eva and Gideon, we just want to accept the dysfunctionality of their relationship for what it is, pat them on the shoulder and cheer them on. If you can just allow yourself not to over-analyze the toxic nature of some of the scenes, if you can become blindly consumed by the magnetism between Eva and Gideon, if you can take the raw pull and sexual chemistry first and everything you might believe makes a healthy relationship second, then this story will take you on quite an emotional ride.<br /><br />  \\"Angel, if I needed you more, I couldn't function. And I don't care what anyone else thinks. We've got our own rhythm and it works for us.\\"<br /><br />The attraction between the main characters is compelling, sizzling, irresistible in its intensity. These are `faulty' characters completely aware of the obsessive and borderline-destructive nature of their relationship but fully embracing it as neither of them is willing to step away from one another - \\"Failure isn't an option.\\" The events unfolding in this book show us just how far they are willing to go to protect each other. Their tragic pasts inevitably made them as they are - I'm almost surprised neither of them have become abusers themselves but I guess abuse comes in all shapes and sizes. They are ultimately abusive towards themselves and I believe this is where their relationship redeems itself by breaking that pattern of abuse and offering an alternative. They are in a way each other's punching bags, if by `punching' you mean really really hot sex. Sex is used as a currency between them, both to express feelings as well as to punish one another. They heal each other in their own messed-up ways, offering the kind of comfort and solace that they are unable to find anywhere else. They are raw before one another, totally stripped from protective façades and emotional defenses. They have a direct `feed' into each other's most primal selves and they definitely speak the same language.<br /><br />Eva brings the tender and vulnerable man in Gideon, she is his one and only weakness - \\"I loved the powerful businessman in the suit and the dominant lover in my bed and the broken child who couldn't hide his tears and the tender partner who held me when I cried.\\"  Gideon makes Eva feel safe enough in his care to be able to do the one thing she has never been able to do - give up control. I never felt that Gideon's caveman tendencies made Eva any less his `equal' in their own dysfunctional equation. She doesn't just lay back and take it, she pounces on him, takes control, makes demands, sets her own boundaries and rules and is never ever afraid of just walking away if that is what she truly wants. They are each other's perfect match in every single way and equally the worse possible one as well.<br /><br />  \\"People get over love. They can live without it, they can move on. Love can be lost and found again. But that won't happen for me. I won't survive you, Eva. ... I'm obsessed with you, angel. Addicted to you. You're everything I've ever wanted or needed, everything I've ever dreamed of. You're everything. I live and breathe you. For you. ... I don't need anything else. I get out of bed every morning and face the world because you're in it. ... Because of you, the world makes sense to me in a way it didn't before. I have a place now, with you.\\"<br /><br />Eva And Gideon's insatiable relationship is not meant to be pretty. It is not romantic in the traditional sense of the word and it is as far from ordinary as it gets. This is not the kind of relationship you would brag about to your hairdresser. This is the kind of relationship you would discuss with your shrink. Daily.<br /><br />So, give the rational part of your brain a holiday, take a seat, make yourself comfortable and dive in expecting lots and lots of hot lovin', drama, misunderstandings, jealousy, obsessive behaviour, addictive personalities and ... have I mentioned hot lovin'? Simply switch off your brain and allow other parts of your anatomy to take over. Advocates of healthy relationships have no place here. Fairy-tale romantics have no place here. Heck, 99% of my brain had no place here but that shameless little 1% was happy as a clam. I LOVED this book. It was everything I expected it to be, nothing more and nothing less. I expected the level of obsessiveness between them to be even more amplified in this sequel. I counted on it. The development of these characters in Bared to You did not allow for anything different. I felt there was growth in their relationship, there was change in their dynamic and they are ultimately moving forward as a couple. This book brings some new problems to the table, takes a few away but it never stops being interesting or unpredictable. It explores human obsession and extreme emotional addiction just perfectly.<br /><br />The characters might drive you mad at times, you might want to shake them or even slap them into oblivion, you might not agree with parts of the storyline or some of the things that Gideon and Eva do `in the name of love', but your addiction to this series will stay intact if you are anything like me. I personally have an unhealthy love affair with this trilogy and I'm not ashamed to admit it. It does exactly what it promises to do, no unrealistic premises, no false pretenses. These books are not how-to guides on functional relationships, they are literary crack in its purest and most delicious form, and I have no desire to kick the habit any time soon.<br /><br />~ N ♥otective façades and emotional defenses.

B008MEM24S|5.0|Tried the free version and enjoyed it so I paid 99&cent; for the full version. Not disappointed and I recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second book in the crossfire series does not disappoint.  In the first book we got to know Gideon and Eva, we were introduced to their intense relationship.  That relationship just gets more intense in the second book in the series when characters from their past emerge.  As messed up as their relationship seems it works for them and you cannot help but to cheer for them.  Their relationship is hot, and although it seems to be based solely on the physical attributes we learn that it is much deeper for both of these characters and see how and what the physical side means to them each.  I love this couple.  This book did not disappoint.  There are lots of hot scenes as well as a great story line.  Now I cannot wait for the third book in the series to see where the characters go from here.  Enjoy the ride.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|This is a terrific addition to the Underworld series.  It is well directed, has superb video production and the dialog is crisp and relevant; it feeds the plot and action scenes with the right context.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I have watched the Dangerous Tour, Bad tour in Japan, HISTory tours in the Philippines, Korea, Copenhagen, the Jacksons and Jackson 5 live shows and some clips of concerts in YouTube but this Bad Concert surpasses all of them. The close-up of Michael in this video is breathtaking. Trickles of perspiration, raw emotion, enduring passion in every song took my breath away. I had tears in my eyes watching him. I couldn't keep my eyes off him for the whole 2 hours and 15 minutes and I still did not want it to end. It is very intimate and truly a performance for royalty. You can't help but feel that Michael is singing just for you alone not for 72,000 fans.<br /><br />The sound is amazing and the restoration is pretty good considering this is from a 25 year old VHS, Yes, a quarter of a century and still Michael sounds so \\"now.\\" I know this concert will make a new generation of Michael Jackson fans. If you are not a Michael Jackson fan, you will be one after you have seen this concert.<br /><br />For this price, it is a steal to own the greatest concert of all time, in fact the greatest entertainment of all time. I am indeed lucky to have lived during the same time as Michael Jackson, the King.<br /><br />I know I will be watching this concert again and again as I do the Dangerous Tour and all of Michael's concert. This will be the crown of them all.
1444737112|5.0|As a cat lover, I have to say I was absolutely in love with Bob from the first time he followed James.  I read this book driving in the car and when the car swerved to avoid something in the road, my first instinct was to protect Bob - yes, the cat in the book I was reading.  It was when I knew I was hooked.<br /><br />A very fast read, a very emotional read.  There is so much more he could have gotten into which would have made this a completely different tale and at times I felt myself wishing he had \\"gone there\\" but as the story progressed I realized it wasn't necessary and the book is absolutely perfect as is.<br /><br />I wish them both a long and happy life together.

0307959856|2.0|I must admit right off that I didn't finish this book. I found it very dull, and was most disappointed that the Pride and Prejudice characters didn't display any of the personality or verve that they did in Austen's novel. I was hoping to see how they'd grown/aged, but learned nothing new about them. Darcy grew stiffer and Lizzie's spark went out on their wedding day, apparently. Also, the story was more of a \\"telling\\" than a \\"showing,\\" so even the so-called mystery was not compelling.<br /><br />This was my first P.D. James book. Based on the respect other reviewers have given her, I might borrow another of her books from the library...but I wouldn't chance buying one based on this outing.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It is not as fast paced as his last book and his characters are less believable.  He is good about bringing in the story from the last book, just in case you had forgotten - which I had at times.  It is also interesting to see how he weaves in history  as we know it today.  It is a good read.
030758836X|4.0|It's hard for me to review this book without revealing too much. Suffice it to say, it is an engaging, realistic, semi-snatched-from-the-headlines look at a mystery and a marriage. I was drawn in from the start, and the twists the story takes are not purely for shock value. I love stories where you get to see inside the heads of multiple characters, see their different perspectives on the same events. This is a great book and a fast read. It's conclusion was both sad and oddly satisfying. I will definitely be reading more from Gillian Flynn!

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I liked this game.  It has a decent storyline  with many levels and puzzles.  The graphic are good too.  It does have a few bugs but nothing to severe.  It ran well on my kindle fire overall.  This game is fun and worth purchasing!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|... you can identify with the panic of facing death. Your ultimate demise or the death of a target. The author comes across as sincere. You are exposed to his ego, ethos and BS-O-meter. No matter your political slant, you will feel what it was like to spend 24 hours with someone who was involved in an evolution that left millions around the world with a sense of satisfaction; that what goes around comes around.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love it!!!! it has every thing you need and more I recommend to use it if you need to get up at a certain time and don't want a clock
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The only reason I read this book was to finish the series.  I found the whole series slightly distateful and very pornographic.  However, the author writes very well and the characters were well evolved.  That is the only reason I decided to read the final book in the series - to see how it all ended.  By the 3rd book (this one), I found myself skimming the \\"sex scenes\\", they all started to run together.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I can't recall how many times I watched this movie since I bought it here in Amazon.<br />I ordered after my husband mentioned how good this movie is and couldn't believe me when I<br />told him I never watched before.<br />Steve McQueen(Papillon) and Dustin Huffman(Louis) are brilliant in their caracters<br />and so deep that they will drag you in the most sentimental and loyal friendship beyond imagination<br />A lot of action/drama<br />This is a movie that you won't forget, A+
0345803493|4.0|I liked the second book, but again, poor writing! Looks like Author/Publisher were trying to get these out asap. Like I said in my review of the first book, proof-read! No one proof-reads before publishing anymore. It's sad.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is amazing. It's my favorite. I have nothing to compare it to. WOW... I read many books. At least two a week and I NEVER read books more than once but I just finished reading this for the second time. I will absolutely read it again and again. If you haven't read it you are missing out on a great experience. I cant wait until walking disaster is released. Every one dreams they will find a love like that.
0345803485|4.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy. I've read it a couple times now. My only complaint, like many others, is it was written poorly. I mean, doesn't ANYONE proof-read before publishing anymore?!
1476715904|5.0|When I bought this book I honestly didn't know if I would like it but this book exceeded any expectation I had.<br /><br />I don't know why I didn't read this sooner! I've read so many reviews about how great this book was but for some reason I just didn't want to give it a shot. But then I finally did and it was honestly the best decision I've made.<br /><br />I'm warning you now though: you will cry. I certainty wasn't expecting it but it felt like every chapter I had to wipe some tears away. Don't worry: the tears aren't a bad thing, in fact they're a good thing. This book was just a emotional roller coaster. Or maybe I'm just a big softie.  I loved that poetry was a big part of this book. I've never been to a slam before but after reading this book I really want to go check them out.<br /><br />Layken and Will have so much on their plate. I can't say much because I don't want to ruin any of the surprises in the book but you will definitely be shocked at certain things. I felt so bad for them at times because it seemed like things just weren't going  their way at all.<br /><br />Slammed  is a must read! I'm so happy I gave this book a chance and you'd be missing out on an amazing book if you didn't do the same!
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed the book it has hints of fifty shades of grey but the issues with these two characters in bared to you are far more disturbing and afflicted. I Loved the intensity between Eva and Gideon, the second book is even more intense and I already pre-ordered the third novel!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's kind of sad just how much I enjoy this series. But despite what a lot of people think about this series, it's good!<br /><br />So much happens in this book, I don't even know where to start. We learn so much more about Christian's past, and oh my gosh does he have some dark secrets. I couldn't believe half the things I read! I kept having those embarrassing moments where you gasp and keep repeating things like \\"Oh my god, oh my god\\" and \\"I can't believe that just happened! This book is so crazy!\\" Fortunately my family is used to me talking to myself when I read a book but I'm pretty sure they think I'm weird after all the talking I did for this book.<br /><br />Christian is every bit as possessive and demanding as the last book but we also get to see more of his happy/playful side. I was so happy with how much Christian really was willing to make things work with Ana. He's one of those character that you really can't help but love. Especially with his email banter with Ana. Can I just say aww! Every time they emailed each other during work I had the biggest grin on my face at all the cute things they said.<br /><br />Ana also changes a bit in the book as well. She's still learning a lot but I'm proud of how well she takes everything, one day at a time. I still wish she wouldn't be so quick to do whatever Christian wants but I will admit she does improve a little in that department. Plus I could see how it could be hard to deny Christian what he wants, he's pretty stubborn.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that I feel like their relationship is moving a bit too fast. It has barely been a month and they keep talking about forever. If all this drama happens in five weeks can you imagine how crazy their relationship would be in a year? Also I feel like they really need to talk more, get to know each other. They've both mention that they do need to spend more time talking and I hope in the final book this happens.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker is as captivating as the first book and I lots even more sleep reading this book then I did for the first one. I just couldn't put the book down! Fans won't be disappointed but they will be shocked by the secrets spilled.g as the first book and I lots even more sleep reading this book then I did for the first one.

B00433TO52|5.0|I already have a 'Complete Works of Shakespeare' on Kindle. The advantage of this edition (apart from the fact that it is cheap) is all the 'extras'  It has those hard-to-get 'apocryphal' plays which I happen to have a reason to study. For me this alone makes it a good deal. But the other extras are useful too particularly the commentaries by Johnson and Hazlitt.  Modern Shakespeare scholars often refer to these works and it convenient to have them ready-to hand on my Kindle. It is easy to navigate using the TOC (which is where some Kindle editions fall down on the job). So all in all I rate it as excellent.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Final book in the series and has left me happy and eagerly hoping for more.<br /><br />I'll admit I was a little confused when I started reading this book because it took place months after where we left of in the previous book but I quickly got used to it. The thing I love about this book is that there is never a dull moment. Every page, every chapter is full of surprises and as usual I've lost many nights of sleep. I was really trying to take my time reading this book because I didn't want it to end but sometimes books are so good you can't slow down.<br /><br />The final book is everything I hoped it would be. Everything was cleared up and I felt satisfied with the ending. Christian is finally able to accept love and his past and Anastasia finally sticks up for herself. But I still want more. Wouldn't it be cool to read a spin off in Kate's POV or Mia's? I've always been a bit curious about them plus we'd still be able to see Christian and Anastasia.<br /><br />I look forward to reading whatever E.L James comes out with next. I'm so happy I decided to take a chance and read this series; best decision I've made this year so far!
098555780X|5.0|You have to have this book!!  Strong words, but paracord survival bracelets are all the rage right now BECAUSE they are a practical way to have some strong cordage with you at all times.  And daggone it, they just look good.  These make great gifts, too.  I've made a bunch in red, white, and blue for volunteer prizes at the local \\"my side\\" election victory office (staying neutral here in the review).  The cobra knots, or what JD refers to as the Solomon Bar knots, are easy to tie, but I wanted some more.  The book did it for me.  The 2-strand diamond knot, sometimes also known as a lanyard knot is laid out perfectly in the book, and that one isn't in JD's videos.  The Shark Jaw Bone, the last bracelet in the book, was the first one that I tied.  It's gorgeous in red and blue.  The Blaze Bar I've tied in several color combos.  The Duality Bar is super-cool.  I liked it so much that I replaced my watch band with a red and blue duality bar, doubling the number of inner strands.  JD (TIAT on youtube) makes it goof-resistant with very clear instructions and lots of photos.  The KBK, Elastic Solomon Bar, and a couple of the endless falls are on my do-it-soon list.  Thanks to JD for the books, the videos, and the inspiration.  If you tie paracord, you have to have this book.  If you don't tie paracord, you will after you buy the book.  I hope JD keeps doing BOTH the books and videos until the last knot is known to us all--aka forever.
0425263908|4.0|I don't know if I loved this book or hated it. I'll start off right at the bat and tell you that this book reminds me so much of fifty shades that I had to remind myself that it wasn't.Well at least in the beginning anyway; once you start reading more this story becomes its own.  But where Fifty shades lacked certain things, Bared to you excelled in it and I'll admit the writing was way better in this book.<br /><br />I have a love/hate relationship with Gideon (I'm sorry but what the hell is up with his name? It doesn't match him at all, at least in my head). He does something really sweet and I fall a little for him and then he does something stupid and selfish and I hate him. I'm hoping he'll grow more on me like Christian did in fifty shades because as of right now I really question Gideon \\"feelings\\" for Eva. There are certain things that happen in the book that justify this for me but I don't want spoil it for anyone so I'll refrain.<br /><br />As for Eva, I really liked her but I'll admit in the beginning she got on my nerves. I mean is it really that hard to not make the freaking protagonist not trip in front of the hot guy? Really? Can we have so darn originality for once? Why can't she have been calm and collective? Or if she really had to make herself look like a klutz couldn't she have don't it in another way? Thankfully after tripping TWICE in front of him, it doesn't happen again and strangely her klutziness disappears. Hmm...moving on. But despite that I really like her. I loved that she was strong and didn't let anyone make her do something she didn't want, including Gideon.<br /><br />Their relationship is such a freaking disaster that I'm honestly scared to see how everything works out. Their two people with a lot of baggage and despite wanting to be together, are always afraid to be together. This sentence probably won't make much sense but once you've read the book you'll understand what I'm talking about. The one thing I liked about this book was the fact that both characters have dark secrets and while we find out Eva's we still don't really know the full story about Gideon. But whatever it is, I'm a little nervous to find out.<br /><br />You're probably thinking I hated this book but I actually enjoyed it. It just had some flaws that irked me but then again, it wouldn't really be a good book if it didn't have some faults. I'm curious to see what happens next and I'll definitely be reading the next book. I recommend it to Fifty Shades fans but I want to remind everyone to read this with an open mind.the fact that both characters have dark secrets and while we find out Eva's we still don't really know the full story about Gideon.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great read! i recommend it to anyone that loves a true story and is interested in history in the making!
0307744434|3.0|Hmm I'm not exactly sure how I feel about this book. I definitely don't think it was worth the $25 it cost to buy it, but it was pretty entertaining.<br /><br />First off: This is not a love story, not really. Erin Morgenstern tries to make it seem like that's what this story is all about but it really isn't. They don't even meet until 200 pages into the book! And when they do meet and \\"fall in love\\" it feels forced and not realistic at all. But at the same time I felt myself swooning slightly whenever they were together. Confusing right?<br /><br />Second: THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION IN THIS STORY! Very unnecessary description, that can go on for nearly 10 pages and half the time I found myself skimming the pages to see when it would end. It felt like she just kept rambling on and on about the same thing in every chapter; I'm sure that if she took out all the unnecessary description this book would probably be half the size it is now.<br /><br />But the best part about this book was the circus. If there's one thing Erin did right it's describing and making the circus seem so real. The circus has all these really cool acts and tents with things you never would dream of but now that I've read this I wish they could be true.<br /><br />The characters were likable but half of them weren't really important in the story, more like filler-ins for the pages. I really liked Celia though, she was strong and a really likable character. And so was Marcus, and since the story is really supposed to be about them I guess it's good that I didn't end up hating the main characters.<br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm torn. I liked the book, but it's one of those books you would buy because it's on sale for $8.99 and you need something to read. For $8.99 it would be a great read, but not for $25. Overall I would say give it a chance, maybe borrow it from the library or your friend so that way if you don't like it you won't feel like you got gypped off. I give it 3 stars because the circus really was magical and it had some unexpected events that actually surprised me.stars because the circus really was magical and it had some unexpected events that actually surprised me.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Excellent descriptive book with complicated & full characters. A little violent at times & losing some many good guys regularly is a bit hard but in the circumstances realistic, no soap opera this one
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So this is what all the fuss is about. To say this series has gotten a lot of attention would be an understatement. I see this book series everywhere I go; on the train, walking, all over the internet. And when my friend started gushing about how great it was and how I had to read it, I gave in. And I'm a little ashamed to say this but I've joined the raving fan group.<br /><br />I don't know what it is about this book that makes me like it so much. I can't pinpoint one exact thing but one minute I'm slightly intrigued, and the next I can't put it down. Christian Grey is one complex character! He has some serious baggage (what's in the bag, I don't know). And he does some things that seriously make me hate him.Like for example, his weird love for BDSM. I'm not saying that people who enjoy that type of thing are bad, if you like that sort of thing then that's great for you. But it's just not my thing. I'm sorry but I do not, can not and will not understand how Ana could let him whip her/hit her. Even if it is part of the whole role playing thing. I didn't find it entertaining, hell even Ana didn't like it. Every time he \\"punished\\" her I wanted to jump into my kindle and kill Christian. But then he has these moments these moments where he's completely sweet and loving and I'm left wondering if I should hate him or not.<br /><br />Anastasia.Ana, poor Ana. She had no idea what she getting herself into. Well she did but the naive part of her thought she could handle it. I really do like Ana but I wish she wasn't so easily persuaded by Christian. She was strong and I'm glad she stood her ground for most things but still. But I love her personality; she's incredible sweet, not to mention funny. Her conscience had me laughing out loud so many times during the book.<br /><br />This book is totally engrossing and I've had many sleepless nights because of it. I feel too many people didn't like it because they put way too much thought and criticism into this book. I have this theory that whenever something is getting too much good attention we have to go and find something bad about it. I'll admit, I did the same thing at first  but once I just relaxed and kept an open mind I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />THIS BOOK REALLY SHOULDN'T BE READ BY ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18!!!

1476715904|1.0|If this book was written without the Slam and the poetry, it would have been so much better, and less cringe-worthy. Just because you boldface every other random word in a ranting paragraph doesn't make it poetry. I think Yeats, Dickinson, and Plath are rolling in their graves right now. God, I couldn't focus on anything else as much as I tried. Argh.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Lately I've been reading a lot of Indie books and I've been surprised with how much I enjoyed them. Beautiful Disaster is no exception.<br /><br />Honestly when I first saw this book I put it on my wishlist but I didn't plan on reading it any time soon. I have a ton of books that I should be reading right now but for some reason every time I would try to read another book, my mind kept going back to this one. Finally I decided to give it a shot and see if it was any good and I haven't looked back since.<br /><br />This book became an addiction to me. I couldn't get enough of Abby and Travis's crazy relationship. And boy is their relationship crazy. I'll admit: their relationship is really unhealthy like borderline obsession.But I couldn't help but love their relationship anyway. Travis did a complete one-eighty for her and was willing to do pretty much anything for her no matter what. McGuire did a really good job with making his bad boy turned good persona seem realistic.<br /><br />I really liked Abby, I thought it was refreshing to have a main character not succumb to a hot guys charm the moment she meets him. I loved that she was so stubborn and really tried to do the right thing while also looking out for what's best for herself. So many times I've read a book where the girl does something stupid just to satisfy the guy they like and I love that Abby wasn't like that. If he crossed the line, she was out. No matter how much it hurt she wouldn't let herself be around someone who would end up hurting her.<br /><br />This book has made me a mess of emotions but I ended the book happy. If you're looking for something to read and like a book that gets hold of you from the first page and doesn't let go, then this is your book.
1476712042|5.0|This book has all the ingredients to make an addicting, contemporary romance. It's filled with drama, with all sorts of breakups and makeups and everything in between. I really couldn't put it down until I finished it---in one day--on a weekday! I don't remember the last time I did that. And then after it's done, you try to find another book that would fill the hole this one left behind, but you can't. Because it's a stand-alone, much to my disappointment.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|WOW. I'm honestly speechless right now because for the first time in a long time a book proved me wrong. This hasn't happened in...forever!<br /><br />OK so first off I just want to say that I really didn't think I would this book. And if it weren't for me being completely bored in the library I probably never would've picked this book up. But I did and I've never been more happy about it then right now. This book is AMAZING! I know I've said this before but I really didn't expect to like this book. The cover just didn't catch my interest at all and the first 80 pages or so I really thought about giving up on it. But its almost like the book knew I was losing interest because suddenly it captured my attention and I couldn't put the book down until I finished it.<br /><br />Grace. At first I didn't like her that much. Well I liked her but she just seemed a little too obsessed with the whole werewolf thing and it really started making me question if she even had a personality outside of it. But luckily character growth is seen a lot in this book. And as for Sam? I loved him from the first moment I read about him. What's even better about this book? We get to read some chapters in his point of view! I love that I got to see thing in his perspective and not wonder what he was thinking and feeling throughout the book. If anything it probably made the depth of this book so much more real because of the switches in point of views.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about Shiver? I felt like I've never read any story like it at all. I know its probably not true but Maggie Stiefvalter's take on werewolves was honestly something I've never read before and while it took some getting used to, I quickly fell in love with it.<br /><br />I don't really know how else I can explain how much I enjoyed the book without either A) Telling the whole plot or B) Repeating the same things over and over again. So I'll just end this review since I'm pretty sure the majority already read this book and totally understand where I'm coming from (hopefully). Of course if you didn't love it as much as I did I would love to hear your opinion aboutok and totally understand where I'm coming from (hopefully). Of course if you didn't love it as much as I did I would love to hear your opinion about

B008J34466|5.0|I don't listen to alot of pop music, but I always find Pink's albums to lie so far from the norm that it is barely pop sometimes. I love her attitude and her spunk. I love that she says what she wants to and if you don't like it, then she has a few choice words for you too. I know parents get upset because of the cuss words in her music. But honestly, maybe those parents should police their children a bit more instead of complaining on reviews and blogs. Whether they like it or not, people cuss and sometimes it is justified.<br />The album tracks are terrific. Probably the weakest one is Blow Me, so if you like that song, you'll like the whole album.

Great story and especially great that super busy moms like me can \\"read\\" and enjoy awesome books like this! \\"Reading\\" this was such a vacation from my long commutes to/from work and the hustle and bustle of life with two very young children.

B007C3TVNA|4.0|This film did a reasonably accurate rendition of the book considering the psychological and sociological issues that lead readers slowly to the grim, unbearable conclusion.  While the book is clearly superior to the film, the actors in the film did a creditable job.  I was very glad I read the book first, however.  Anyone interested in the psychology of psychosis needs to read the book.  Themes include anhedonia, attachment disorder, sociopathy, and the list goes on.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|wow, this maybe one of the most disappointing albums ever, boring.........<br />it sounds like she is going through the motions here.  there is more activity on the front cover than in this collection of songs.<br />2 bad albums in a row,  doubt i will be fooled a third time

B004SKXYYW|5.0|I feel bad for all those who paid big bucks for the physical copy of this only to have it arrive damaged. There aren't many comments on here about the actual music though, so I'll offer my two cents.<br /><br />As a bit of context, I've had the CD of this album for years and loved it, and also had \\"The Layla Sessions\\" box set (well, back when it came on cassette!). I needed to get a new copy because I didn't have a non-scratched CD or decent MP3 versions.<br /><br />This has turned out to be an excellent buy - the live versions of some great songs are very different from other live cuts I have of those, and the recordings of the Fillmore shows are raw (i.e., energetic and fiery) but still sound very good.<br /><br />I confess I haven't made it through all four 'discs' yet, and I'm sure there is some redundancy here, but I've been eyeing this 'super deluxe' version for over a year and am glad I finally picked it up.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I went into this movie not expecting anything. I saw the previews and it looked funny, but cheesy. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. The storyline was cute and predictable, but it has a way of making you forget you know the ending. Has a few laughs for the adults and the kids were laughing all the way thru.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you were on the fence on whether or not you wanted to continue with this series after reading [[ASIN:0425263908 Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]], I assure you that you need to continue. This book was better than the first. While the first book has the allure of the first sighting, it deals with a lot of back story and the couple learning just how dysfunctional they both are. Reflected In You has the advantage of showing us how the two work on \\"trust\\" issues while also falling into an even deeper attraction. Honestly, Sylvia convinced me. They are dysfunctional. They are misfit toys! They need each other way too much -- but they have a connection that is so intense, it's easy to start reading this book and next thing you know it's 4am and you're done!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I'll begin by saying that I'm a Lee Child fan, hooked on Jack Reacher novels. I really like the way Child describes environments that Reacher passes through and the characters he encounters along the way. At times Child does get his physics wrong but the stories are so exciting it's easy to forgive this.<br /><br />I would have given Wanted Man a 5-star (remember that I'm a fan) but for the last scene, which just stretched verisimilitude slightly too far for me. Still, it's a page-turner and I enjoyed reading it. Then again, I enjoyed reading super-hero comics as a kid. I hope Lee Child continues to write Jack Reacher novels, even though Jack is getting kind of long in the tooth for an action hero.
B009KZZTO8|3.0|The vocabulary alone flummoxes me - these people are seriously weird with strange values and moral compasses.  I am thinking this is the point of the show, maybe what is trying to make it funny, I am not sure.  I keep watching, recognizing the sarcasm, but wondering why all of this goofiness precludes one authentic relationship between or among the cast.  The great shields of gross humor are sort of the anti-relationship and, I am guessing, that is the point and what makes \\"New Girl\\" different from other television programs.  I will continue to watch because I am curious and it makes me a bit uncomfortable.  A good boundary stretcher.
B001HBYHFA|1.0|Pretty much sucked since I wasn't allowed to watch it. I am a US citizen but currently I'm in the UK at grad school and I went on amazon it allowed me to rent the movie pay for the movie and NOT watch it. I really wanted to watch the movie. I normally never have issues with amazon but they shouldn't have let me buy it if I couldn't watch it.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|The book started slow but rapidly picked up momentum. The story was believable with a good plot and feasible actions.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is such a great,  entertaining game that is not just for kids but for adults. It's free so what more can you ask for in a game available on kindle fire.

B003X271YU|5.0|I just loved this book, its so thought provoking and sad and really very educational. I learned alot about Alzheimers disease throughout.Its a heartbreaking disease and this novel is so uniquely told from the sufferers point of view. You will fall in love with Alice, sympathise with her family and cry lots.
1455863866|5.0|I am simply stunned that this book (and the first) are written by a single person. Kvothe (the main character), the people and places he interacts with, the stories... simply phenomenal. Both these books are instant favorites. Also, the audiobook performer is amazing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much. The interaction between the characters was unique. This book kept me on the edge of my seat. Can‘t wait to start reading book 2.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I have pretty much everything Diana has released under her own name except for Quiet Nights, which I skipped because I just didn't like her singing approach on that album (too \\"breathy\\" for my taste). In short, I'm a longtime Diana Krall fan. I was pleased to hear Diana singing better again on Glad Rag Doll (more like the pre-Quiet-Nights albums), but this album, overall, just didn't grab me, and I ultimately decided not to buy it after three careful listens. I like three or four of the moodier songs in minor keys with a bluesy feel, but many of the others just didn't strike me as that interesting. Some of the songs strike me as having possibilities (I'm an amateur jazz pianist, composer, and arranger myself), but I think the arrangements on Glad Rag Doll leave a bit to be desired at times (the sometimes thumpy bass and percussion, in particular, and the tendency, on some tracks, for the instruments to drown out Diana's singing a bit). Overall, I would say that Glad Rag Doll, to my ears, is somewhat of an improvement over Quiet Nights. It might even grow on some fans, if they listen to it several times. I'm not at all opposed to Diana performing and recording in different settings or even exploring different genres other than jazz (recall how great \\"A Case of You\\" is on Live in Paris), but this project fell short somewhere in the choice of material and in the execution, I think. I sense that she's been struggling to figure out in what direction she wants to go musically since The Girl in the Other Room, which I thought was a solid effort (her last album that I really liked, though From This Moment On is ok). It's a shame she didn't continue doing ORIGINAL material (she's a good composer) in a small-combo setting. There's room for virtually unlimited exploration and growth in such a format, and there would be plenty of opportunity for her excellent jazz piano chops to shine through (when I first started listening to her, I actually listened primarily for her piano playing and viewed her singing as \\"icing on the cake\\"). The influence of her husband Elvis Costello is obvious on Glad Rag Doll, and that could, as many others here have pointed out, be part of the problem with Glad Rag Doll. In the meantime, I'll continue to enjoy All for You, Love Scenes, When I look in Your Eyes, The Look of Love, Live in Paris, and The Girl in the Other Room for many years to come. They're gems.
0345803507|5.0|I totally enjoyed FIFTY SHADES FREED as well as the other books in the trilogy.  There are a lot of people making comments about someone who reads these books but I read a great deal and I liked the story.  They were just fun to read.

0525953728|5.0|This account of the end of UBL was very well timed and a welcome factual account with no politics.  Written by a real HERO who, like his brothers in arms,  made it happen when he was called upon to do so.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|\\"Cold Fact\\" is an outstanding collection of tunes that deserves the recognition that is now being thrust upon it. The songs were superbly produced with professional session musicians years ago, featuring psychedelic sound effects that resonate throughout the recording. I recommend that you buy this well produced disc to not only enjoy the music of Rodriguez in digital splendor, but to also ensure that the artist receives the royalties that he has been boldly denied over the years.<br /><br />Rodriguez played many of these tunes live at a solo gig a few weeks ago in Detroit at the Old Miami Lounge in the Cass Corridor. There was a CBS crew there interviewing him outside the club before the show for an upcoming episode of the 60 Minutes TV show to air in October. It was an impromptu gig and also somewhat surreal to witness him performing in 2012, after 40 years of relative obscurity, fame had eluded him even in his own hometown. The crowd was filled with young hipsters, old sages, suburban thrill seekers and everyone in between. His music radiated warmth and soul and he was somewhat chipper between tunes, exchanging jokes with the audience, while pondering aloud his new found fortune.<br /><br />What surprised me was that he appeared frail at the relatively young age of 70. (Maybe all those years of doing construction work in the city has taken its toll on his body). Nevertheless, his mind was sharp, his politics intact, and his convictions appeared stronger than ever. High upon the outdoor stage behind the bar, he struck an imposing shadow over those that witnessed the performance, like a modern day shaman spouting poetic wisdom to the masses. His message was clear in this election year: The man has always kept the working class down, but that's no excuse to not make your voice be heard, to not exercise your rights as a citizen to vote or protest the status quo.  My take away from seeing him up close and in person, away from the big screen, is that he is a thoughtfulman that tells it like it is.  And amazingly, somehow, after all this time, what was relevant in Rodriguez' words from decades ago is still true today. It's a cold hard fact indeed.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follett writes well with excellent character development. This volume carries us through WW2 making very real the human tragedies that brought to Europe. It would be best to read the first of the 'Century Trilogy' before reading this thick book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is very relaxing.  it is low stress and fun.  a little bit addictive too.  you should try it.  still tryingto figure out the puzzle part of game.  not too many details for them.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Interesting, action-packed, and a lot of material for one book. Almost would have preferred he fleshed more things out, and he can be a little too gratuitous with the '80's nostalgia (I was born mid-80's, so maybe I'm not the target demographic, though.). Would read a sequel.

1400052181|5.0|Compelling. Disheartening. Informative. Humbling.<br /><br />The story is told in an engaging way and the scientific information does not bore.  This book is eye opening and tells the unfortunate story of a family who never obtained answers or justice and were taken advantage of. Every person should know the story of the Lacks family to give them a voice and recognition. I fell in love with the Lacks family and yearned to learn more information than what was conveyed in the book.<br /><br />The author's dedication and persistance paid off and I cannot even begin to imagine what an emotional ride she went through while writing this book.

B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is just amazing. Great characters with great voice acting. Story is really well done, although it may take a second viewing to really get everything. The movie also, just looks good. The color and the animation is really impressive.<br /><br />Also, after watching this movie you will care more about the environment. Because you don't want to kill the spirits of the forests JEEEEEZ.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I am a real person reviewing this and I am telling you this is one of the best shows on t.v... worth every penny. It keeps you hooked because every episode is just so good. I will be so sad next year for the last season! There is really nothing this good on t.v. right now.

B008XX6J92|5.0|Such a special release (and grab it on vinyl while you can).<br /><br />Highlights:<br />I Think it's Going To Rain Today - with the then relatively unknown Randy Newman on piano.  Sung so directly, simply.  Puts Midler's version to shame.<br /><br />Glocca Morra/Heather - just sheerly beautiful.  Rupert Holmes, you are the man.<br /><br />Home - Streisand in full throttle, and she delivers.<br /><br />Didn't We? - Ir'a Jimmy Webb, enough said.<br /><br />The vinyl release is still a thrill, the way music should be made - sequencing (the order of songs) was so incredibly important (rather than today's world of pick and choose your mp3).  You not only get the back liner notes, but the envelope inside containing the record has full, extensive liner notes, and then another full insert, covering what's on Side Two.<br /><br />I usually buy a Streisand recording, listen once, and it goes on the shelf (notable exceptions - The First BS Album, The Second BS Album, and People (with People being the least of what's included).  This recording, I'll listen to repeatedly.<br /><br />The Liner Notes, btw, anticipate a Release Me, Vol. 2, as well as the foreshadowing of an upcoming big box entitled \\"Barbra Streisand: My Life In Words and Music).<br /><br />Also, don't miss (releasing also on October 9th, Barbra's son Jason Gould, and his EP of five songs.<br /><br />Again, get this vinyl before it disappears.  It's a real joy.
B008XG1X18|4.0|would have given it 5 stars, but it often freezes,  or takes several attempts to load.<br />other than that,  love love this addicting app!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|If you'd like a recap of the storyline, you should probably go to other reviews.  This Reacher effort reminds me of the episode of Seinfeld that takes place in the parking garage when they lose their car. It's a story purposely limited in setting to force the characters to react to each other and their own thoughts. That's not my favorite episode of Seinfeld, far from it, but it's still Seinfeld so I'll still watch. Know what I mean?

0316228532|1.0|When I received this book I was excited to see where JK Rowling would take us to this time. She never disappointed with her 7 HP books so I was pretty confident she wouldn't disappoint this time. Well needless to say I was too bored to figure out how this book ended. It was boring and I felt like the author was trying to be too edgy. It drags on and nothing really happens other than some really boring government issue. If you are seeking to find an adventure and some comedy this is not the book. It is definitely an adult book and not suitable for children. I wont bother reading anymore books in the future from this author.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|Warning, Spoilers!  Really, 'Reflected in You' was just dreadful.  The first book, Bared to You was soooo good.  It gave us Eva, a damaged but strong career woman who liked sex and food and kicked butt, literally.  So refreshing!  Then Gideon, who despite his awful name, was a gorgeous, mysterious alpha-male with a dark past.  I was really looking forward to the second book revealing Gideon's Dominant preferences so deliciously hinted at in 'Bared to You'. The evil Nathan was looking like he might make an appearance.  And, of course, more of those HOT sex scenes between Gideon and Eva.  Yay, I was counting down until 2nd Oct.<br /><br />It all started to go wrong in 'Reflected in You' early when Eva was calling Gideon \\"ace\\". Shudder, that is such an uncool nickname and I was embarrassed for them both.  Eva is now a self absorbed whiny b***h, and half of the book was all \\"he said/she said' non-drama.  The sex was forgettable.  It was so boring I skipped most of it, when in 'Bared to You', I was all like, whoa, lets read that AGAIN.  There were continuity issues and a few times I had to check whether I had missed a page of the book. Nope, it just didn't flow well. And some of the scenes were just cringey, particularly the fingering scene at the rock concert, and the cheating kiss afterwards.  Seriously Ms Day - a rock musician ex, now made it big, loved Eva all along?  How cliched and 13 year old fantasy is that?  And all the exhibitionist sex, as a bystander it would be mortifying to witness.  I felt like that embarrassed bystander.  Gah.<br /><br />And then there is Gideon.  There is no way that the Eva in 'Bared to You' would have put up with his non-communicative, controlling nature.  I could just about forgive the whole rapist dreams stuff in 'Bared to You', but it certainly made me uncomfortable.  That carried on in 'Reflected in You' and the whole theme was uncomfortable again and now boring.  Done that.  I was waiting for Nathan to make an appearance so Eva could use her krav maga \\"mad skills\\" on him.  But, weirdly, we never got introduced to him, interactions were happening with other characters without Eva's, or our, knowledge.  So Eva goes to krav maga and just so happens to see a police detective that spills her guts and gives us the whole story.  It was just implausible and I was horrified that Gideon now appeared to be a murderer.  But murder is apparently ROMANTIC and Eva is grateful and more in love than ever.  If my man murdered someone that appeared to have mental health issues I would be calling the cops, not lusting after him.  He KILLED someone.  That disgusts me and Eva's reaction to it disgusts me more.  Boo! How could you destroy such a good thing Sylvia Day!uld use her krav maga \\"mad skills\\" on him.

0525953728|5.0|From the moment I started reading to the very last page this book had me hooked wanting more! The story of these regular people is insane, its amazing how these men do these incredible things and they're not so different from us, they call have a home and family the only difference is they spend all of their time serving this wonderful country. This book is  very entertaining and it's a great firsthand account of the tier 1 operators on the ground. Very moving story on brotherhood and how the man at your side will have your back to the very end.

0743496736|5.0|Jodi Picoult is a phenomenal author. Every woman in my family reads her books and avidly awaits the next one.<br />Nineteen Minutes tackles a difficult subject, and the author handles it extremely well. Whether it causes the reader to ponder the difficulties of rearing teenagers in today's social environment or evokes memories of the cruelty one has observed at times in teenagers during their own educational experience, cases of bullying and unfriendly treatment of some students, it brings the reader to think. Picoult treats the facts, and the questions that arise, with honesty and clarity, without attempting to find answers or preach.<br /><br />As with all of her books, I was able to visualize the agonizing events and choices through exceptional characters. The author breathes life into her characters and, in my opinion, they are the mainstay of every book. Interesting and unusual plots, yes, but the wonder is in the characters.<br /><br />I almost withheld the final star due to the ending. This is not the first time the end of her book has disappointed me. It feels rushed, without the careful handiwork that most of the book displays. I fear it may be a requirement that the ending be a shocking surprise. While that can be powerful, it mustn't happen simply to fulfill a strategy. On the other hand, the very fact that the ending seems somewhat ill-fitting to me may be the genius of Picoult, since I continue to think about the books long after I finish reading it.

B008PJ3IDO|5.0|We have followed Duff for a few years and have enjoyed seeing every band he's been associated with.  We attended the show in Portland Oregon just to see Duff perform again.  I'd say it was about 30 seconds into the first song when my wife and I looked at each other with a look that said it all.  And then it just got better and better.  The energy in that short show was amazing.  The lead singer has \\"it\\", and backed up by the insane (for lack of a better term) energy of the drummer, demanded our attention.  And when it was over we immediately purchased the CD and checked when they will be coming back to do a full gig.  The lyrics, funky blues, and exceptional playing make this an album to put in your collection.
B0002KQNJU|4.0|I first saw this film on tv a couple of years after it was released. I've always been a fan of horror films since i was a kid, so naturally I approached this film with that mindset the first time I saw it.  It was probably thirty years until I saw it again, with a more mature eye, and it struck me very differently.  Most of the reviewers here and elsewhere address the comedic aspect of this movie.  That is the main focus, of course, but there is much more to it.  Polanski, though born in France, knows how the poorer people live out in the east European countryside; this shows in Shagal's inn scenes and adds authenticity. The sets and settings throughout are gorgeously intricate and engrossing, as is the musical score.<br />The thing that really grabs me is the underlying creepiness inherent in the film. The count is powerful and sinister without overtly trying to be; the exterior and interior castle shots are stunning. Beneath every comedic scene is an undertone of malevolence that makes you feel uneasy. I sometimes wish that Polanski had made this as a pure horror movie rather than a comedy; it certainly has the foundation for it. As a comedy it is a bit weak, and can't be compared to \\"Young Frankenstein\\" (which I also love).  It could have stood out as a classic horror movie, rather than being relegated to the cheap comedy bin as it has been by so many reviewers.<br />Just a wonderfully quirky, different sort of film, worth seeing and owning if you are a fan of the genre at all.
B008RC72G8|2.0|Tim Burton takes everything that made the original series so wonderful and trashes it.  I'll admit this is a very beautiful looking film and the cast is for the most part very good but the story is so poorly executed that it simply becomes a CGI spectacle by the time the film lurches to its routine conclusion.  Burton makes some unforgivable errors with the story.  By turning the Collins family into a down on their luck bunch of has beens, turning Collinwood into a dump (and then burning it down), making theCollins family an object of hatred in the town of Collinsport, rather than the respected community institution, and changing the nature of ALL of the characters from the series...it just isn't DARK SHADOWS any more.  Even cameos from original cast members are wasted, as is the appearance by Alice Cooper.  Nothing works.  The entire film has been boiled down to a movie by committee.  You can see all the places where studio execs have had their input and alterations made from endless test screenings. It ends up being another typical bloated Hollywood extravaganza lacking heart, creativity and emotion.  Sincerity and originality are no where to be seen on screen.  I will say that the costumes and set design are gorgeous and if they had been put to use in a film that had an authentic script instead of this cobbled together atrocity they could have really enhanced the film.<br /><br />Now I'm not just another fan of the series complaining that they changed everything.  When I saw the first trailer for the film I was shocked and delighted to find that the film was a comedy.  I would have been fine with a comic take on the beloved characters.  As it turns out, THE FILM IS NOT REALLY A COMEDY, in fact it seems to have no idea what it is.  ALL of the comic bits were shown in the trailer and the rest of the film is played pretty much as a strange fish out of water horror drama.  The sudden shifts in tone are jarring and mostly obnoxious.  With such a talented cast and gorgeous look, this film is such a missed opportunity that it is depressing.  All of the merits of the film (and there are a lot of them) simply are not enough to save it from an awful script and a wildly self-indulgent director who seems to have run out of original ideas and simply keeps remaking his own tired movies over and over and over again. I doubt I'll see another take on DARK SHADOWS in my lifetime since this one was a failure at the box office and despised by most critics.  Too bad.<br /><br />The Bluray transfer is fantastic.  Not a flaw to be seen anywhere.  Absolutely beautiful.  I bought the bluray only edition and it has one short documentary as an extra feature.  A pretty bare bones affair in keeping with Warner Bros new ultra cheap standard blu ray releases complete with no artwork on the disc and a bluray case so flimsy it will fall apart if looked at.  Menus are also bare bones (actually a good thing) and the disc loads quickly with no BD live garbage and no forced trailers.  There is a skipable hype trailer trying to persuade us all to dump our current HDTV's and Blu ray players and purchase new 3D equipment so we can watch stellar versions of such classics as GREEN LANTERN and CLASH OF THE TITANS 3D and animated films about penguins.  Yippy.  Rest in Peace Barnabas.  You deserved so much better.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I had heard about this book from many people encouraging me to read it.  I'm sorry but I just don't get it!  the book is disappointing on so many levels. The content is bland and predictable and I found myself speed reading after the first chapter!<br />It had no real content to 'Get into\\"  the characters were lifeless and quite frankly boring. the idea of pretty people immensely wealthy smacks of teenage comic scripts.  The sex,  well frankly, get a life, even that was portrayed in a bland manner and was distinctly unexciting.  Sorry,  I gave it 1 star because that was the lowest I could click.
1439102430|5.0|I was definitely not disappointed with BONES ARE FOREVER. I've read every book in this series--many on audio CD. Tempe is a strong, intelligent female heroine--still a rarity. This book, number fifteen in the series, is much better than Tempe's recent NASCAR adventure. Loved Linda Emond's reading of the audio version, especially her perfect French accent for a minor character. The Canadian atmosphere and local color for Montreal and the Northwest Territory are impressive. Diamond mining lore, a big part of Reichs' exposition, provides strong motives for the antagonists. Enjoyed the repartee among Ollie, Ryan and Tempe, and I must admit (as a peace-loving pastor) that the \\"bad guys\\" were people I could love to hate. In my opinion, the Tempe books set in Canada are by far the best in the series. Can't wait for the next! By the way, I don't like the \\"Bones\\" television show, but I love the books.

0316228532|1.0|I bought this book hoping to be entertained, but was disappointed. I was led to believe it had a comedic edge, but I failed to find anything funny in it.<br /><br />There is nothing new in this book-- drugs are bad; teens can be both self-centered and stupid; small towns are petty; poor people have a tough time of it; sex can be pointless and sad; many adults are disappointed with their lives. There is Rowling's message that our society is basically crap with screwed up priorities. Is this anything we have not heard before?<br /><br />If this is her gritty reality novel, it is \\"gritty reality lite.\\" There is a danger in creating a novel with all unlikeable characters, but none as truly evil as she would have us believe-- and making no likeable character with which the reader can identify or care about.<br /><br />The heavy handedness starts with at least five mentions of a \\"skeletal\\" abbey on a hill (religion, and therefore, morality have been abandoned here, get it?) in the first 50 or so pages. There is the truly-saintly (but unrecognized as such, until it is too late) \\"bad girl,\\" and the obligatory \\"tragic\\" ending. All this leads to-- what?  I don't know. There were no tears at the end. There was relief that it was over.<br /><br />Save your money. I wish I had.
B009A3NGF4|3.0|There is nothing to groundbreaking here. After hearing about this band I had high expectations. This is just Celtic themed music being introduced to the pop masses. I felt the same way about Doc Watson when I first heard him in the early 80s. The old Norman Blake fans said \\"this is nothing new, rookie\\" Same thing here.<br />I do on the other hand appreciate Babel bringing non-synthesized acoustic music to the front.
B004F1F32A|5.0|Believable. Entertaining. Action packed. Full story. What more could you want. Most underrated movie of all time. Amazing movie. Every now and then you come across a movie you can watch over and over and over...may I introduce 'Taken'.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Very well written account of a young woman's search for herself.  Realistic and compelling, the author's experiences keep a reader focused and wondering what's around the next bend on the PCT.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I usually do not write reviews but felt compelled to do so with this book. I loved Bared To You, but this book blew me away. I was on a constant ride of emotions. Happy, angry, heart broken, happy again. Ugh not a good book to read when you're hormonal to begin with but I enjoyed the ride regardless. I'm not including any spoilers in my review, just know this book tops the first installment. I can not wait until the final installment!
030758836X|4.0|This was the perfect end-of-summer read for Labor Day weekend with a few mojitos.  (I suspect it would work as well on a rainy afternoon with a pot of tea or a glass of sherry.) It is very well written, but not exactly a \\"literary\\" novel.  The character development is brilliant (if sneaky, but that's part of the enjoyment), even if there are very few characters that are likeable by the end (and what happens at the end, anyway?). The way in which the author manages to create and then tie up loose ends (or sometimes not) is worthy of Dickens.
0465011047|5.0|This is THE book about why the west must act now to stop the Soviet style totalitarianism going on in North Korea.<br /><br />This book is a damning indichtment on the inaction of the rest of the world while families are torn apart and millions suffer.<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone who considers themselves to have an accurate world view. I promise you will be a different person at the end of it.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I have  been a big fan of Child and Jack Reacher. This book is a thinly disguised attempt to capitalize on the terrorist theme. A highly improbable plot.<br />One fisticuff and no affair.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Let me begin with the simple fact that this story is amazing, and left me turning pages with a rapidity that bordered on a blur.  I am only writing this because I discovered through reading other reviews that this was a self published ebook; i had come back to the book on Amazon to see if it had received any literary award since I read it.  It was one of the best fantasy books I have ever read- incredible character development overlaid on a world that slowly reveals itself (history, geography and politics) as the protagonist grows and expands his knowledge of his place in the world.  I was really disappointed to find that the sequel is still far from publication!  As for the editing mistakes- I was so drawn into this story that I missed all of them (nearly!), and this is not through a lack of knowledge... I typically find (without looking) two to three errors in most books I read from the \\"big publishing\\" companies (this was the first self-published book I remember reading).  I believe I was so caught up in the story and characters (and plot development) that I just read right past the errors.<br />A second motive I have for writing this review is to STRONGLY encourage (something I almost never do- who I am to tell you how to spend your time?!) you to read this book if you enjoy fantasy- this author needs to be moving mainstream and selling his books at \\"real\\" book stores with hard covers, and stickers on the cover (best seller, literary awards, price sticker, etc...).  The more actual reviews he receives, the more likely he is to be noticed by a publishing company, and then the more likely he will be able to quit his day job and write full time! (thereby getting the sequel written sooner! lol)  Read this book- I cannot recommend it any higher!  (and for those who get \\"hung up\\" over the editing, the more who read and enjoy, this very fine novel, the sooner the author will be able to produce a better edited, professionally published edition :) )
B008JDAC7G|5.0|great game. too good in fact. I have set time limits so I wouldn't play this game all the time
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Of course the 2nd season of \\"Downton Abbey\\" exceeds superlatives, as every knowledgeable cinephile is aware.  So, in this case, does AMAZON, who once again delivered a perfect product, promptly, with no hitches.  Thanks again, AMAZON!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was a nice mix of hidden objects, mystery, and puzzles. The hint feature works well and points you in the right direction without giving too much away. The graphics are gorgeous, and the storyline was engaging. A great deal!
1932735410|5.0|A must have for all who want to get the best results out of the PMI exams. A great book by all standards.
0374275637|4.0|This is a well organized book written with clarity and wonderful examples to help understanding of the concepts that can be rather intimidating for an average reader.  The two ways of reasoning, intuitive vs. effortful, and the ubiquitous applications, biases and exploitations are demonstrated with research data as well as personal examples.  There are some parts that can be a little text book dry, but they are minimum and really unavoidable to explain the processes that led to the conclusions.  I enjoyed reading this book and will think twice about decision process and hopely will exercise more slow thinking from now on.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just like Gideon, I'm having a hard time finding the words that express how much I loved this book.  I adored the first book, but Reflected in You blew me away.  Best book series ever.  My only complaint is that it is too cruel making us wait until December for the third book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think its pretty awesome and useful! I like how you can view how much time you can watch videos and use the Internet. I also like how you can view your power history and stuff like that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's novel \\"Gone Girl\\" works at many levels - part suspense mystery, part social critique, part lament for Great Recession America. On the morning of Nick and Amy Dunne's five-year anniversary, Amy suddenly disappears from their townhouse in North Carthage, MO. What follows in the novel is Nick's search for his wife in the decay of cul-de-sac America and Amy's diary account of the death of their marriage. As the police investigation uncovers signs that point to Amy's murder, a lurid media circus erupts that demonizes Nick.<br /><br />But not everything is what it seems. About [SPOILER ALERT] halfway through the novel, there is a revelation that turns the entire story upside down. Flynn is going for something more than just a fast-paced mystery ripped from the proverbial headlines. \\"Gone Girl\\" is a mediation on the self-deceptions and illusions we maintain in marriage. Flynn suggests that we don't really know our partners and that perhaps the illusion of a good marriage is just as livable as the reality of a good marriage.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is suspenseful and thought provoking. One of the best books I've read this year.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy. fun. attainable goals with patience. which makes it a long term game. I enjoy it and it helps me hone my patience skills. great teaching game for a.d.d. and such.
B007SGM084|2.0|Was okay.  Book was WAY over hyped.  Kept my interest though.  Would recommend to friends.  Good fritos for the brain.

B000ARFNNM|3.0|I ordered this DVD and didn't pay attention to its shipping location. It came from the U.K., and it was not able to play with our Standard U.S.A. DVD player! Uhg! I was able to make it play through my computer, after downloading a few codecs, though.<br /><br />Other than that, the shipping was quick, the movie's great, and have no complaints. I'll just make sure not to order \\"media\\" type-stuff outside the U.S.A.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|a bit repetitive and takes a while to level but fun overall especially on online co-op. deathmatch is annoying because any lvl can join and own you so not fun if ur lvl 10 and a 50 pops in.  but worth the download especially since I got it for free (free app of the day).
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game reminds you of being at your towns carnival. its very fun I enjoy playing this very much just wish I could play without waiting for coins to build
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great! I love it! It doesn't stop or any thing like that its great I use it all the time((:
B002WTOXUK|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, specially how they made it seem realistic with the news and documentary scenes. I won't give the plot away, reminded me a bit of battle Los Angeles.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What more can they fit on a Blu-Ray - you get the 3D & 2D Blu-Ray versions, DVD and Digital versions, plus the soundtrack! At $20 from Amazon I have yet to see a better deal anywhere else.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Works fairly well, I have no real complaints yet. It's easy enough to use and I like that I can swipe through to look at other peoples' pictures.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|This is dramatic opera at it's very finest. The performances by all are genuine masterpeices. Let us try to keep in mind that this is live theater. Staged as such. True, I have read other reviews that feel the dramatic sets are not as Wagner envisioned. And they are not. Plus the Dragon leaves a lot to be desired. The \\"Ring\\" has never been produced as Wagner wanted it to be both seen and heard. However this is a \\"STAGED\\" work and \\"NOT\\" a motion picture that has undergone an extensive digital format. Sit back, relax and allow the entire production work it's magic.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book flows verywell and keeps you interestedfrom the beginning. Tells enough to understand but does nt give away secrets.
034580404X|5.0|Yes, I am one of the millions that secretly 100% LOVE the Fifty Shades series.  I agree that I probably shouldn't...but I love the characters, the story line sucks you right in, making you want to see what happens next,  and the romance??  Raunchy but I totally loved it :) Great series.  If you are thinking about reading it..just do it! :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I could NOT put this trilogy down!  WOW...I so fell in love with Christian Grey, I actually cried as I felt the deep love he had for his Ana. You brought back wonderful memories, thank you!
0316228532|5.0|I loved the book. It reminded me a lot of [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]], except that it's set in modern, small town England. \\"Casual Vacancy\\" is a term referring to a city council seat that is empty due to a death of a council member, but symbolically it represents the moral vacancy in the lives of these characters and how their lack of morals and lack of love/compassion affects the lives of those around them. It's also about showing the layers of yourself you try to hide to make yourself appear normal or good-looking.<br /><br />If this were a movie, it would be RATED R for sex, domestic violence, drugs, and language. Not recommended for those under 15.<br /><br />It starts off slow like many 19th, early 20th century novels. It takes awhile to get to know each of the characters because there are many characters and some of them have a better second impression than first. However, once you get past the first 100-150 pages (its 503 pages total), it really picks up the pace and gets interesting.<br /><br />The hacked messages posted on the city council website and some people's reactions to them are pretty funny.<br />Krystal and Robbie's stories are so moving. I cried a few times.<br /><br />Besides general themes like morality and mortality, and the author's name on the cover, it is completely different from Harry Potter. Even Rowling's narrative style is very different, as it should be, to reflect the different characters' personalities and also because fantasy and reality-based stories need different styles of writing. So just because you like Harry Potter doesn't mean you will like Casual Vacancy. Authors are allowed to write stories that are very different from each other if they want.

0451169514|1.0|Other reviewers here have commented on their disappointment with the ending of the book. I do not find my point of agreement with that stated clearly enough in any of the reviews I have read, so here it is: a book that has a gratuitous gang-bang scene of an 11-year-old girl by her friends, an act she encourages, and is OK with, deserves all the bashing it gets. The scene is gratuitous, it does not promote the plot, character, or is any way integral to the demise of the monster they are stalking. If the scene of this act were to be written because of the influence or possession of the characters by the pervasive evil of IT, the author might -- I say MIGHT -- have been able to justify it. But there is no remorse or fright about this act. It is disgusting -- not horrific, but the characters act like it is necessary.  But nowhere is it justified. And it ruins, what up till that time might be a good book.<br /><br />I am not anti-sex or anti-violence in literature. I have read and appreciated certain writings that have children involved in these things.  But they must must involve the story. The above scene is not explained in terms of anything that leads to a resolution. The scene is bound to lead a lot of people to shock value, not appreciation. If that is what King was after, well, congratulations.  But it is at total odds with the rest of the book.<br /><br />The world does not need another review of a King novel. I know I am late to this party. The paperback has sat on my shelf for perhaps a decade, probably purchased in bunch with others at the bookstore or library discard table and then life got in the way. I had a moment and picked it out. I have read a fair bit of King. I particularly admire his short stories. They are tightly plotted, as a rule, and are excellent. But the reading public does not follow short stories the way they do novels. I tire of his characters that are recycled time and again. Anyone in his novel that has a small bit of faith (and usually Christian) you know are going to be described as judgemental idiots that are one step away from killing anyone who disagrees with them.  Any character who might lean a bit more to the right politically is a pre-conversion Scrooge who wants to unleash totalitarian rule in the country. And there are more. Mr. King would do well to update items in his imagination from a late 60's protest chant sort of mentality.hristian) you know are going to be described as judgemental idiots that are one step away from killing anyone who disagrees with them.

B0063IH60K|4.0|The game runs smoothly on the Kindle Fire and is very fun to play! I'm glad that I purchased this game and don't regret doing so at all.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I definitely understand some of the old school ND fans feeling disappointed and one of my first thoughts was it does seem more like a Gwen cd than a ND one, BUT having said that, I have really been enjoying this cd.  There are several great songs that will get stuck in your head and enough ska elements infused without the cd to keep old fans at least mildly happy.  I think this is their best cd so far.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book!  By far the best thing I have read this year.  I can not wait for the third installment of this trilogy!  Sylvia knocked this one out of the park.  The only thing I didn't like was that it ended!!!!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Absolutely epic!! Following the second generation was just as much fun as the first:-) I can not wait for the third one to come out. Couldn't put it down!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|You haven't truly seen 'Avatar' until you see it in Blu-Ray.<br />In addition, this version with two separate extended versions of the original, adds more details about the storyline and characters that weren't included in the theatrical version. Along with that there are other extras and bonus features not included in previous DVD versions.<br />I purchased this set used but it came pretty much in new condition, almost as if the only thing that was done to it was to remove the outside wrapper.<br />In all, I most definitely recommend this set as a must have addition to your Sci-fi collection. At the asking price and with all the added bonus material (the packaging is very nice also), is definitely worth it.
1423140605|5.0|I've only read about 2 chapters, but nothing really to spoil you about so here it goes. There a LII chapters, so that is 52 and 4 demigods are the chapter narrators, they are the greeks which means we will only get Annebeth, Percy, Leo and Piper, sadly none of the others. I haven't seen what the name of the next book will be, but I took a little peek and it says Hades in it, and it's coming out next Fall in 2013, which is far much more time than Rick really needs, having the experience for type for many years. There are 573 pages and the cover looks a bizillion times better in person because the colors look way nicer. The title on the cover is shiny gold and the hard cover under it is bright red and the inside is purple. So can't wait to read it!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|What is there to say that hasn't already been said. Great cast, great writing and great production. When all is said and done, this show will go down in TV history as one of the best.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am in sixth grade. I am a math wiz already but obviously I don't know every kind of math out there. So I love the setting where to turn the alarm off you have do answer a certain number of math problems correctly. Works especially for people that need to work on their math skills. No oftener to those people though.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I had this book recommended to me, but it was priced at $9.99 and because I didn't know if I would love it, I kept putting it off. I was skimming my wish list one day and saw it had dropped to $2.99 (just for that day) and I snatched it up...<br /><br />I would have paid $9.99 if I knew how amazing it would be! These characters are relatable, likable, and enjoyable. The plot was well developed AND original, and the pace was perfect. Other than Harry Potter and a couple other books, I was not very into fantasy. After this one, I'm a fan. I pre-ordered Shadow of Night before it came out, willing to shell out the $14.99 (which is ridiculous for an ebook) and was glad I did.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|this game is fun and filled with action.. go from level to level killing zombies and upgrading your weapons and skills
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|There are some negative reviews/comparisons, and everyone is entitle to their opinion, but I think these books are fabulous!<br /><br />I AM an avid Harry Potter fan, and yet I still enjoyed these stories. Cassandra Clare has developed great characters who you want to know more about. I have been flying through the series and this first book hooked me (or I obviously would not have read farther). I find myself caring about the characters, wanting to know what happens. When I'm not reading, I'm thinking about reading! These books are wonderful. Give them a shot -- they're worth the price.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|Why is itnthat all of a sudden it's going to fast? Normally it eases into a faster speed now it just starts at a fast speed. I don't like it. I hope it's just a glitch.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I saw the trailers for weeks and figured I would not appreciate the special effects... you know just too much to take in.<br />Anyway, when it came available on Amazon, I was surprised to see it off the theater market already. But at the great price for a movie here at home we bought in. We both enjoyed the movie to the end, worthy of the theater prices which I didn't have to spend. Time and money well spent for exciting intertainment.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|could be much better. ought tto have more adventures other than the hack n slash for single player Gaea yardage yada
B00846TRHY|2.0|With a name like this and after watching some trailers, we tried this movie. Now, I like movies with happy endings and this flick didn't even win there. Slow at times and a frustrated end.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I heard someone compare this to Ocean's Eleven and YES, I can totally see it.  There is definitely that heist vibe as the crew is selected and gathered and plans are laid.  Kelsier is SO George Clooney -- charismatic and competent, with a charming boyish immaturity.<br /><br />George, I mean Kelsier, hand-picks a crew to undertake what he believes will go down as the greatest job of all time -- overthrow the Final Empire and free the slave-like skaa from the oppression of the tyrannical Lord Ruler.  At first, his crew views it as a job for money (complete with an employer and everything), but as they find themselves deeper and deeper in the midst of the rebellion, it turns into much more. Kelsier, meanwhile, has his own personal agenda that he does not initially share with his team, with an endgame that no one could guess at until it happens.<br /><br />There are many moving parts to the plan, and as each member of the team has his own special skill, each is assigned to head certain tasks (army recruitment, weapons acquisition, general mayhem, etc).  We mainly follow Kelsier (general mayhem), and Vin, his recruit from the streets, as she infiltrates the aristocracy as a spy.  For some reason, it took me awhile to figure out that the main character of the book is Vin, rather than Kelsier.  But she is a likable protagonist and her growth (both in skill and character) is done well.<br /><br />As to the world-building:  Allomancy - it's totally crazy and brilliant.  I won't go into what it all is here, but trust me, it's unique and interesting.<br /><br />This was definitely a fun adventure to read.  I'm pretty new to the fantasy genre, so if there were certain too oft used fantasy tropes that people complain of, it didn't bother me.  Mistborn: The Final Empire is the first book in a trilogy, but it has a complete storyline and does not end with an annoying cliffhanger so you can read it by itself and be completely satisfied, as I was.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Feelin' a little sorry for Leonard, whatwith all his mishaps with Penny (most of the time unintentionally). But aside from that and those times he at first couldn't catch a break, this season was pretty full of surprises (both in plot and in guest stars, top one being Stan Lee's cameo) and trademark nerd humor, even with a few nice religious jokes (\\"Stop correcting me or I'll kill you, I swear to cow!\\"). Though I do find it sad what happens with Leonard at the end, maybe next year there'll be a rebound?<br />Here's to hoping.
0312263511|5.0|A very enjoyable read, filled with a lot of insights into the struggles that the astronauts had to overcome to get the job done.  A lot of interesting insights into the personalities of the astronauts.  Well worth the money spent.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This had me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next thing to happen.  VERY HOT and intriguing all in the same book.  When I got to the last page I was yurning for more as it ended so abruptly that I had to start the next book immediately!!!  Wow this author does know her stuff!!  I give her credit as she really did her homework well! Excellent!!
B008OE05IG|5.0|The film is a true visual masterpiece of the art of sushi. The development of sushi according to Jiro is a true balance of visual and sensory harmony.
0345803493|4.0|Thank goodness they get back together in this book and their relationship progresses....very quickly.  She learns things that would appall most.  They are quite hot and bothered by each other, but as in most relationships there is also good and bad, but finding the common things that intrigue you about the other is the most fun in many ways.  The author has done a lot of homework about BDSM.  I give her kudos.  There are a lot of repetitive scenes, but it makes you very hot that is for sure.  I do appreciate that she is bringing Mr. Grey out his shell.  I will not give away any of the story as many have as it is part of the intrigue of reading the story.  It had me on the edge of my seat again as the plot grew many times over with a lot of drama.  For such a short length in their relationship so far a LOT has happened quickly.  I will say that Mr. Grey is very lucky that Miss Steele was a virgin or I believe he would be tracking down every man she would have ever been with to make sure they never were able to speak again; as Miss Steele keeps running into issues with his previous lovers.  There is something to be said about closure.  It can be a good thing to end things mutually and amicably on many levels!! Excellent reading no matter what anyone says about the writing.  I am off to read Book 3 now!!  Well Done!
1423140605|5.0|So, I have to say that this book is easily the best book in the Heroes of Olympus Series. Not only do everyone's two favorite characters reunite, but it also manages to mix in some really great battles. Probably my favorite aspect was that we finally get to see more of Annabeth, who had been largely absent from the preceding two books in the series. The fact that Annabeth finally got to be a major character again, along with the fact that we finally got to view things from her perspective really helped the book stand out.<br /><br />Without revealing any spoilers, I will also say I think the ending to the book was brilliant. I expect that a lot of people may disagree with that opinion and say the ending was terrible, likely because they wanted resolution, and frankly the ending is a bit short on that. But it was very well plotted out, and in my opinion it sets the stage for what looks set to be a spectacular fourth installment.

0316228532|1.0|When I read, I want to be entertained.  I wasn't. I didn't expect or want Harry Potter, but the characters were colorless.  It may be Peyton Place vs whatever ---as stated in a previous review, but I didn't like Peyton Place either.  I kept waiting to be fascinated with the characters, but it was like a hum drum ...nothing interesting to catch my attention or make me want to turn the page......not my cup of tea.  I don't think I will finish it.

0525478817|5.0|I am not overstating it when I say that this is the best Young Adult book that I have ever read. It is in my top 3 favorite books of all time, behind only The Great Gatsby and Ender's Game. The wonderful thing is, this book has intentional tie-ins to The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />All I can tell you is to read it. I'm afraid anything I write, even in praise of the book, will not do it justice. I will suffice to say that it is a perfect combination of subtle hints of philosophy intertwining with an accurate depiction of love, loss, and death.
B008PJ3IDO|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am blessed to live in Seattle where I have been able to see all of Walking Papers live shows thus far. This bands live shows are some of the best that I have seen in this city, and I have been lucky enough to see all of the big names that have come out of here before they hit the big time.<br /><br />This is an album that you will be blown away with how good it is on first play. You will find your favorites, and then on repeated plays the others will become your new favorites. There is no filler on this album. Every song is a hit. Trust me on this.<br /><br />There is big time talent in this band. From Jeff Angell guitar and vocals,(Post Stardom Depression, The Missionary Position) Barrett Martin on drums,(Screaming Trees, Mad Season, Tuatara) Duff McKagan on bass,(Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) Benjamin Anderson on keys,(Rorschach Test, The Missionary Position) and even Mike McCready of Pearl Jam plays on this album.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this album. If you like blues rock and great lyrics you will not be disappointed.
014241493X|5.0|I might be biased because I already love John Green, but it seems like each of his books that I read does not waver in quality or let me down.<br /><br />Paper Towns is the third book of Green's which I have read. The other two are Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our Stars. Each one has such a different but crucial theme to it; themes that are extremely important to human life.<br /><br />The theme of Paper Towns has to be our humanness. It deals mainly with how we so often let people become so much more in our minds than what they really are, and they end up letting us down. We expect too much of people, as if we expect them to be more than what we could dream of. My favorite quote from the book is \\"What a treacherous thing it is to believe a person is more than a person.\\" In my mind, that encompasses what the whole book is about.<br /><br />While this book is contemporary young adult fiction, it practically feels like an adventurous mystery thriller. I stayed up until 3 in the morning to finish it... As the protagonist chases his supposed love of his life around, trying desperately to find her, he becomes more aware of himself. It's a beautiful thing how different he seems in the beginning compared to the end.<br /><br />The excitement and mystery behind the uncovering of each sequential clue is practically more exciting for the reader than it is for the protagonist who is searching for them. The book shows how people can view themselves as nothing, and not even realize they are someone's everything.<br /><br />It's a great read for any John Green fan, Young Adult fan, and really readers of all ages because of the universal theme of humanity.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is great and a whole lot of fun but if you don't want to spend a lot of money on coins then you can only really play it once or twice a day
B0094KF4WG|4.0|A gripping account of the execution of Bin Laden. Some details were omitted such as the use of anti radar technology on the two helicopters, probably for security reasons. Nevertheless, a riveting read.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Wonderful book! I highly recommend it...definitely a tear jerker though so be prepared!! a good and fast read that was hard t put down.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm so glad this book was as good as I had hoped it would be. This is a wonderful, well written series. Eva & Gideon obsession with each other is addictive and compelling. Their relationship is diffiult and strange at times which makes the book even more interesting. Can't wait for the next novel- Entwined with you. Lucky for us it's supposed to come out in December!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thought he would be tooting his own horn but was pleasantly surprised that he didn't.  Credit for successful missions always went to team. Great book and would recommend it to anyone, especially to all Americans that believe in freedom and what it sometimes takes to ensure that freedom.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I got this book actually an hour before it was scheduled to be released...yes, I was THAT anxious to read it.  Since I have read it twice, and find that it leaves me just wanting more.  Gideon's darker side, while disturbing, makes him a fascinating character to read, in contrast to Eva's desire for power, and independence, and the reality is that she has accepted she is broken.  The quest for resolution of the past hit the mark precisely where it needed to be hit... the foundation of their relationship being primarily sexual in nature, made the emotional rollercoaster of the events as they unfolded that much more intense.  If you haven't read the first one, ensure you do before this one, and then clear your schedule, cause it will grab you and just pull you in...  Can't wait for book three, and I, for one, hope that Ms. Day takes the opportunity to give them the happy ever after!
0741470314|5.0|Dr. Karen, did a wonderful job writing this book. The information in this book I have never read before. It was very interesting and at the same time sad with all the things Michael had to put up with.All the things he couldn't do. He just wanted to lead a normal life. All the info on the bodyguards, how well they protected him.I miss MJ very much. I have about 20 books on Michael and I must say aside from Moonalker, THIS IS THE BEST!!! BUY IT!!! Thank You Dr. And Thank You Amazon.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett never ceases to amaze me. This book is not only a great story, but is full of historical information that is fascinating. I was very young during the period covered by this book and never realized what was really going on until this book. My hope is that book III does not take as long to come out as book II did.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|This is an excellent flashlight. It is solidly constructed but is surprisingly lightweight. The finish on the handle is very comfortable to hold for extended periods of time, and the buttons are easy to push and feel like quality pieces of material, there is no wiggle or cheapness to this light. The threading on both ends of the light are smooth and well fitted, the light is rated IPX-8 which is a submersion rating, the rating system is confusing and murky, but anything above IPX-7 is at least submersible in up to about 3 ft in water, and I can confirm that this light works underwater. The light comes in a handy little plastic case with 2 additional O-rings,a lanyard, a small brochure for some additional lights in the line, as well as an instruction manual and a warranty registration card. Be sure to register your light as the company will extend your free warranty period by 6 months, which means the first 2.5 years you own this light anything that goes wrong with it will be fixed for free. The company also offers paid maintenance on the light for life, and considering the build quality, that is a good deal. The light has two buttons, one turns it on and off, the other adjust the brightness. The lowest setting is comparable to a maglite mini(15 lumens) and is low enough to not be offensive inside close quarters or when reading a map. The next 3 settings get progressively brighter and can best be described as bright(100ish lumens), ungodly bright(250ish lumens), and good lord who turned the sun on?!(860 lumens) It does not have an adjustable beam because it doesn't need it, it simultaneously throws a solid flood and a well focused beam up to 350 meters. Also, there are no hollow, or dark spots in the beam pattern, just nice white light. This light also has two flashing patterns, if you depress the brightness setting button for 1 second it will begin to strobe at the highest beam setting, if you depress this button for 3 seconds it will switch to an automatic SOS pattern on the medium setting.<br /><br />This light uses AA batteries, and it takes 8 of them. Even with all the batteries this light is comfortable to hold and is not heavy. The company recommends using 2500mah ni-mh batteries and has posted a rating of 240 hours (approx 10days) on the lowest setting and about 2.5 hours on the highest. If you use regular AA batteries you will see comparable times but they will be less. DO NOT USE li-ion batteries in this light, both because they aren't designed for this sort of thing and because the company has an awesome diagram which says that li-ion is \\"banned\\" which is hilarious. I'd recommend taking your time to pick up a quality set of ni-mh batteries and a charger, but your run of the mill AA will work fine while you're looking. This light can also run off of 4 batteries in a pinch btw.<br /><br />Other users have reported that the battery cage rattles, this is a result of the batteries having a little wiggle room in their slots, and is more accurately described as a slight vibration when shaking or tapping the light against something.It should be noted that this same wiggle allows you to quickly remove the batteries from the cage, which you should do anytime you aren't going to use the light for a while, battery leakage and expansion is bad for electronics. I have also read that many users exhausted efforts trying to get the SOS feature to work, which is strange because it took merely a few seconds to locate the instruction in the manual, and it works fine. The light also has a settings memory so it retains the brightness level it had when you last turned it off.<br /><br />This light is perfect for what it set out to be, a hardy utility light that uses a standard battery type, is a comfortable size, and will last for years. It can also turn night into day and can stay on for over a week. I'm done buying flashlights.<br /><br />PROS<br />Lightweight<br />Solid<br />Bright<br />Long battery life<br />Emergency settings<br />AAbatteries<br />Waterproof<br />Doesn't get hot<br />Great warranty<br />2 button operation<br />BRIGHT<br /><br />CONS<br />None.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was excited to read this book since I had been seeing it on best seller list for a long time.  I was a bit disappointed.  I found that I did not like the characters so I had a hard time really getting into the book.  I did appreciate the twists and turns provided by the author, but I came away feeling just a little bit sick by the end of the story.  I would only recommend this book with a caution as to not expect a feel good read in any way.  Kudos to the author though for an unusual, clever plot.
B0085MNZ66|1.0|Unfortunately this application force closers each and every time on my Droid Razr with ICS. So, no stars from me until this is fixed.
B005LAIHYU|2.0|Abe Lincoln: Vamp Hunter is a hot mess of a film that isn't frightening enough to be classified as horror, funny enough (at least not intentionally) to be a comedy, nor thought provoking enough to be a satire. The characters serve merely to support the action, which in turn functions entirely as a structure for the effects (which, along with the sets and costuming, are rather good). Somewhere in the midst of watching it I got a craving for Gone With the Wind, which made me realize how fantastic a vampire Scarlett O'Hara would have been. Now that is a movie (and book) I would love to get my hands on.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|movie dragged on.scenery was beautiful but that only goes so far. Kids enjoyed it so that's what is important.I did'nt really care for it.
0316228532|3.0|A writer from The Guardian dubbed this \\"Mugglemarch\\" and I must agree the name is apt. The descriptions were decent and the \\"point\\" is a worthy one. Sadly, the tone of the story is so jaded and bitter (even if understandably so), that a spark of mystery (or dare I say magic?) would not have been amiss. I know that entertaining her readers isn't Miss Rowling's goal, but SOMETHING felt lacking and all the overworked prose and detailed descriptions in the world simply cannot disguise (what I found to be) a disappointingly mediocre work of satirical social commentary.
0681891033|5.0|Very handy book if you do pin up photography. All the poses are great. Most of the major works are in the book and it's an invaluable too. Worth the money.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Liberties were most certainly taken, but the majority were for the best.  My biggest beef... what's with Ron and Harry?  Are they even friends in this film?  Said coldness (or at the very least, lack of chemistry) aside, the series finale was very well done.  I'd rate this among the top three Potter films.  Also, I once wanted to be C. J. Cregg when I grew up, now I think I want to be McGonagall.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the book because it showed how a girl struggling to do what's right still had to grow up with the decisions she made and live through even the bad ones. She learned who to love and trust and kept them close to her.
B007C3TVNA|4.0|Fascinating, well-acted and deeply disturbing, We Need to Talk About Kevin is a movie you'll only need to see once. Whether you'll want to see it again is entirely dependent on whether you'll feel emotionally capable of reliving the narrative's events. The images and tone, so brilliantly used to tell tell the story, have lingered with me months after I've watched the film.
B007A6XLDU|4.0|Va rápida como un rayo. Mueve los archivos al vuelo. Tiene la mejor presentación que he visto. Le pondría 5 estrellas si también pudiera abrir los documentos que tengan clave.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|2 and 1/4 stars if I could: this, like their Alice in Wonderland, was visually fun and mildly entertaining plot-wise. Not as clever, humorous or darkly melancholic as I would have liked, the costuming and sets were still greatly enjoyed.
0788859544|5.0|the movie i ordered was delivered within a couple days of ordering!  i love fast delivery!  it came wrapped in cellophane and looks new.  the movie is a christmas gift for my daughter so i will gind out if it works (i'm sure it will) then.  great job!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Were Steve McQueen or even Charles Bronson alive and acting today, this is the movie they might make.  Not that this movie needed them: Ryan Gosling proves once again that he is a compelling actor with the ability to navigate perfectly between drama and gritty action.  As much as I adore McQueen, Gosling demonstrates every bit as much talent as McQueen did in Bullitt and far surpasses Bronson at the top of his revenge game.<br />Drive, even if erroneously relegated to being a \\"car movie,\\" is a car movie with substance and style, something that has almost been destroyed by the likes of the Fast & Furious franchise.  Less flash and effects, more brain and artistry - one can imagine this film holding up well for decades to come.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was one of the few books I've read that I found hard to put down. Smart, suspenseful, disturbingly sad and wildly entertaining!
B004SUDQ8Q|3.0|Heartbreaking and outrageously offensive, Rabbit Proof Fence is most brilliant in how it maneuvers the audience to the same eye level as Australia's \\"Stolen Generation.\\"
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This was a pretty good read, never read any of the author's work before but tried this one out due to the Amazon $1 book deal and it was certainly worth it. will likely get more of his books at full price.<br /><br />The story obviously had a Twin  Peaks inspiration, but also had a good deal of Lost and The Prisoner inspired feel too. To the author's credit he does answer most questions by the end of the book.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|This could have been a decent movie.  Heck, it could have been a great movie. Tighten up the plot, add some witty humor and snappy dialogue, throw in a handful of clever references to the classics and we would have some substance beneathe this very pretty but oh-so-shallow film.  With a cast this expensive (and sexy AND talented) you'd think they'd hire some decent writers.  Oh wait: they hired four, including the brilliant Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes.  Aha, Jerome Salle: this miserable disappointment reeks of your shoddy writing. Thanks for creating yet another flick of epically empty proportions.
B00887490Y|1.0|I personally cant figure out why Jessica Beil keeps getting work and this movie is a prime example.First off this is not a horror film at all.I watched this movie on Net-Flix because the cover art shows a dark figure hovering over Beil.When you advertise something to be something that it is not i dont know about you but i feel like ive just wasted time that i could have spent watching a real horror film.Dumb plot,bad acting(from Beil)and the worst rip-off ending ive ever seen .I had hopes for this movie with horror genre actors like Stephan Mchattie and the x-Files cigarette smoking man William B.Davis but this film is not even a horror movie!The big climax at the end is completely ridiculous,so save your money and dont buy,rent or waste your time on this turkey!
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|Lacks the detecting and deliciously Poe-esque tone of Ritchie's first Sherlock.  The chemistry, score and wardrobe all remain excellent, despite the movie playing out more as political intrigue than a true mystery.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This App is very good. It remembers  what u last did even if you forget. very easy to use.I just love it...
B001MYIXAC|4.0|Let the Right One In is a beautifully melancholic story, done justice by the hauntingly bleak atmosphere of the film. Still, the streamlined sophistication of Let Me In offers a significant improvement to its forerunner in several respects. Watch them both, if you can.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just finished Reflected in You and all I can say is WOW!!!  I'm a huge fan of Sylvia Day but I have to say that the Crossfire Series is by far my favorite.  It's very rare that you find a book that is even better than the first one.  I expected the story to be similar to the first book, but I was surprised to find that it was different but VERY much enjoyable.  I cannot wait for the third book to be out, I hope it's as good as the first two because I will definitively be counting down the days until the third novel comes out!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Martin delivers more of what we loved in the previous 2 books; political intrigue & treachery, love & lust, detailed character development & lush setting details, mysterious fantasy & harsh reality.  I can't put it down!
1423140605|5.0|Percy and Anabeth dont die(hopefully) But will some one knock me out and wake me up for the next one so I dont have to wait?
1423140605|5.0|This book was so worth the wait, it was that awesome!! To start off, we've got 7 demigods going on a quest for Hera - Percy (Poseidon/Neptune), Jason (Jupiter/Zeus), Leo (Hephaestus/Vulcan), Annabeth (Athena/Minerva), Piper (Aphrodite/Venus), Frank (Mars/Ares) & Hazel (Pluto/Hades). However, Annabeth has a quest all of her own for her mother along the way too.<br /><br />This book is told from Percy, Annabeth, Leo and Piper's POVs (all Greek demigods if you noticed). Before the seven can depart on their quest, a whole new dispute takes place between the Greek & Roman demigods leading to Romans marching on Camp-Half-Blood to avenge the supposed insult (won't spoil it for you).<br /><br />Anyway, to cap it all - there are Giants and whole lot of monsters and new Gods that we meet here. The suspense of it is that you have to guess who you're seeing along with the heroes of the book - and Rick Riordan is a master in building suspense with a humorous twist to every line he writes. He's only gotten better and better with each book and this series is all set to get more spectacular.<br /><br />The end was jaw-dropping - with 2 of the 7 heroes falling (again won't spoil it). Still, it was a cliffhanger and don't know how I'll survive the suspense till the next book.
0307474259|5.0|As a middle-aged woman who has been obese since my daughter was born 30 years ago, I had about given up on losing weight. This book changed my eating habits and changed my life. The science convinced me. It can be a challenge to read, but the bottom line message is clear, easy to follow, and effective.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The story line was fine, but with all of the build up of Snow White going mano-a-mano with the Wicked Queen, I thought that the ending scene was not very exciting. I thought they could have done more with Chris Hemsworth's Woodsman character in that scene.
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|I can't add much more to the reviews other than pointing out two things.<br /><br />1) The choice of theater is INCREDIBLY annoying.  I know it was picked for its history, name, and prominence, but this was NOT an ideal theater to perform this show.  It limited the use of props and sets so much.  The fact that they had to use TV screens on stage to simulate a lot of the scenery says what a poor choice this was.  I miss the elephant in Il Muto, I miss Christine's dressing room actually being in a room and not just an open space on stage, I miss the chandelier rising and falling, etc...<br /><br />2) Hadley Fraser is the worst Raoul I have ever seen.  Raoul is supposed to be a softie, a privileged \\"I had everything handed to me,\\" prissy, pretty boy.  Hadley decided to try and put on a \\"tough guy\\" image.  It does not work in this role.  In fact, it makes him seem like a huge JERK at times when interacting with Christine.  Why someone didn't tell him to tone it down is beyond me.<br /><br />PS<br />3) Why no 3-D in the Blu-ray?
B00631VJIC|5.0|Hey<br />Great cd great songs well done right out of the tv show into the living room! shiped fast great pkg
B008C1O8CA|4.0|Green Day sheds some of the bombast of their last couple albums to get back to some straight-ahead, driving rock and roll. They haven't given up their ambition to produce great work, though; this is, after all, the first of a trilogy of albums to be released mere months apart.<br /><br />Billie Joe Armstrong doesn't have a wide variety of melodies in his arsenal, so a number of the songs remind me of earlier Green Day songs. The big difference between now and then is that this group has developed into more than just a tight band, they're master crafstmen. The songs are well-produced, fully fleshed out, and played expertly, something only real pros can do. So, no, it's not a full return to the \\"punk\\" of their early years, but Green Day were never particularly punk to begin with. Brash and uncouth, sure, but they've been a power-pop-rock-and-roll band since they burst into the mainstream with Dookie. The rebellious spirit comes through in some of the lyrics (see \\"Kill the DJ\\"), but it's not a youthful rebellion, it's more the sound of the fire still burning within aging guys.<br /><br />I think this is a solid album, not as good as American Idiot, but at least as good as 21st Century Breakdown due to being a bit less self-conscious. My hopes are high for the next two entries in this series of albums.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very great app. Does exactly what it says its does..I always know where my batter stands. I recommend this appetite to everyone. works very well on my kindle.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game and very interesting...Definitely had a great story line and I was totally glued to the game.You wont regret buying it and for such a great price.Well worth my time and money......
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG- I couldn't imagine it would be this good! I enjoyed Fifty Shades, but this series is better in my opinion. If you love drama, romance, comedy and hot steamy scenes- this book is for you! It keeps you involved the whole way through. I read the book in one sitting because I could NOT put it down. Bring on the next book because I want more of Eva and Gideon!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|This book is WOW. Did not think Gideon could get any hotter! Love hurts but these two are made for eachother!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The next chapter of a three volume set by Ken Follett is a treat for those who enjoy reading history through the use of well developed fictional personalities.  Few people can grab the reader as well as Follett and few periods of history were as tumultous as the focus of this book - the 20th Century.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Wonderful and interesting game.  This isn't your daddy's old hidden object game or your mommas crossword puzzle.  Enigmatis is so very much more.  Thanks guys you hit this one outta the park. Now get busy and release part two.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|awesome mash-up mixes and so was the movie..<br /><br />i wish the mash-up mixes lasted longer than one minute.  they should have extended mixes just for the soundtrack.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I wish that I had waited for the paper back edition.  I paid too much for the Kindle Edition. I had eagerly awaited the second book of the trilogy and preordered it, since I had  enjoyed the first book.  The second book moves too slowly and is boring. Since I started reading Winter of the World and paid a lot for it, I've plowed through it. Half way through, I'm interested in what will happen to the sons and daughters of the  characters from the first book. I'll finish it, but will check out the third book in the trilogy from the library or buy the paper back book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow.  This book was an emotional roller coaster!  Gideon and Eva are so dysfunctional, but I adore them. Sylvia Day never disappoints and this is no exception. I'm as addicted to G & E as they are to each other. Not to mention lots of HOT, STEAMY sex!
B0013FXWU6|5.0|A movie of EPIC PROPORTIONS spanning a life time. Greed, paranoia, religion, false pride, dishonor, deception, control, corruption, abandonment, and murder are primary in the life of an early day oilman played by LEWIS. Not pleasant, BRUTAL but entirely RIVETING. A WORLD WIDE AWARD WINNER. BRILLIANTLY DIRECTED by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights). GREAT CINEMA
B000B5XOYI|5.0|The Batman Anthology was a gift for my son. It came in a beautiful box, which I didn't expect. It will protect the four movies for years to come, plus my son uses it as a decoration for his Batman themed bedroom! Thank you!

0525952926|4.0|With a heavy heart, this is only the second of nine books I've reviewed for Follet that I haven't given five stars. I'll explain why I gave four stars, still a good rating, and why I didn't give it five stars, a great rating. By the way, if I could rate the book something like a 4.25, I would, as four stars doesn't quite do justice, but rating five stars would be a little too much.<br /><br />Why I gave it four stars: In my opinion, one of the greatest signs that a book is entertaining is that it doesn't even feel like you're reading a book. Pages flew by for me, with the many storylines all being interesting and the characters once again very compelling. Follet doesn't really develop his character's with emotions, instead he develops them through dialogue, with the things they say, and actions, with the things they do. It's a little difficult to keep track of all the characters, though the major ones are easy to follow and each of the five or so storylines are almost equally enjoyable. Not only are many new characters introduced here, including the six or seven main characters, but previous characters from Fall of Giants appear frequently and sometimes play an important role in the events that take place. It can seem daunting, but the stories blend nicely and become easier to follow as the book goes on. As a reader, I can only applaude Follet for writing another story such as this on a grand scale, and keeping everything mostly in order. If you've read Fall of Giants, then you know what you're getting with this book. Fiction and history blended together *almost* seamlessly. For me, not knowing a whole lot about WWII, it was exciting because I had no clue what might happen next, and what way things would go. If you're very knowledgeable about the war, I could see how it might not be as exciting.<br /><br />Reasons why I didn't give it five stars: Mainly in the first half of the book, things seemed too coincidental, such as two characters running into each other in a large city like Washington D.C. However, even though these characters may have last seen each other only 50-100 pages before, sometimes a year or two has passed in that time, so it still was somewhat believable.<br />Also, mainly again in the first half of the book, some things happened which felt a little \\"soap opera-ish\\", like a character falling in love helplessly in such a short time span. It might of helped the fictional aspects of the book become more exciting, but to me it came off as slightly unbelievable. Then again, it IS fction, so I'm not sure what to think.<br />A minor complaint I had was the storyline with Lloyd Williams was focused on a little too much the first two-thirds of the book. I would of enjoyed reading more about Lev Peshkov or the Von Ulrichs than was featured throughout the book. Again, this is only a minor complaint, and during the last four hundred pages it was much more balanced.<br />The last reason why I couldn't give five stars is because I felt like Follet may have tried to stick just a little too much history and too many events into the book. This causes some short-term storylines to feel a little thin. An example would be the Chuck Dewar or Erik Von Ulrich storyline. I guess I can understand why some evnts had to be hastened, as the book would probably end up around 1500 pages had Follet not skimped on the details.<br /><br />So, here's my bottom line. If, like me, you enjoy Follet, and especially Fall of Giants, then Winter of the World will almost certainly please you. It's worth the time and money in my opinion, and I do fully plan to read the third book. Although this wasn't my favorite book, I have an enormous amount of respect for the work that Follet puts in. Between Fall of Giants and this book, it's pretty much a 1900 page story concering five families and the events surrounding them during thirty years and two world wars. Phew! I have nothing but extreme admiration for Follet as author.<br />If someone asked what I thought were Follet's best books, unfortunately I wouldn't say this. However, if someone asked me if I would recommend this, my answer would certainly be yes.ought were Follet's best books, unfortunately I wouldn't say this. However, if someone asked me if I would recommend this, my answer would certainly be yes.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I came across this by accident a couple of weeks ago and decided on a whim to buy it. This music is amazing. The tracks are very short, which is slightly disappointing, but I was so mesmerized by what I was hearing the length didn't matter. I listened to the entire album in one sitting. I'm very pleased about that because I hate buying an album only to find out later that I'm fond of maybe three or four of the tracks. None of these songs are skippable, in my opinion. I'm a lover of classical music as well as epic screen music, so this album is the best of both worlds for me. I will definitely consider buying Archangels as well, simply based on this album.

B0098VXE50|2.0|Visually it was a beautiful movie, the acting was good (except for Ms. Theron's over the top shouting moments, I'm actually a big fan of hers),I'm usually also a fan of James Newton Howard's scores but this just felt unfinished or rushed, the writing or screen play was the real problem for me, the characters were just not fleshed out properly and the story just never really felt like it was building towards anything, and I just really couldn't bring myself to care one way or the other about the characters. It's surprising for a film whose moral message is supposed to be about inner beauty, I found it to be rather....shallow.
B006PTZNQQ|3.0|I bought this version of the CD single specifically to get radio-friendly, edited versions of Nicki's songs.  However, it is not the CLEAN version as described.  \\"Starships,\\" for example is not edited; it contains all of the original profanity.  Not sure why the CD is marketed as edited when it is not.
B009A3NGF4|2.0|I fell in love with Sigh No More. It was (and still is) a brilliant album. So I was greatly anticipating this follow-up. While they remain a great band and have a great sound...this album sounds TOO much EXACTLY like Sigh No More. I bet it would take no effort to do mash-ups of songs from these two albums. This has sadly been a problem with several bands I've liked lately.<br /><br />I will hope for some stylistic growth from them on their next release.
B006UG90RM|4.0|It's been a long time coming, but David Lee Roth and the Van Halen Brothers reconciled long enough for a new CD.  I should preface this by saying that I went to a David Lee Roth/Sammy Hagar concert about 9 years ago maybe.  To be kind, Dave was not very good.  Sammy is always the entertainer that connects with the fans on a level that many cannot.  I loved both incarnations of Van Halen.  I couldn't wait for this album to be released.  I wasn't at all disappointed with the product.  As everyone knows, Eddie's Son, Wolfgang replaces Michael Anthony on BASS.  I thought the album was very good.  Eddie is the reason to purchase this CD.  He is amazing, and Dave does just enough tongue-in-cheek lyrics to keep us interested.  He isn't the vocalist he once was, but it passes.  Nothing I could type would sway you either way, but I thought it was a terrific comeback.  Eddie is to music what Tom Hanks is to movies.  Why wouldn't you want more?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent app. All the battery info you could need. I use it almost every day.  Cant beat the price either.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected In You - Sylvia Day<br /><br />DARK AND DANGEROUS<br />SEX AND MODES OF TRANSPORTATION<br /><br />What can I say... the best book I've read this year... maybe even EVER!!!  Maybe because it's been a while since I've revisited Fifty Shades of Grey, but at this very moment, I can honestly say that this book, this series is WAY better!!!!<br /><br />Of course the plot is what it is... Eva trying to get Gideon to break down some walls and Gideon not giving an inch!!  For a sequel, this was AWESOME... usually (for me) the more books that come out in a series, the less I like them... not true here... this was better than it's predecessor Bared To You!  You throw in some \\"Rock Star\\" and a deranged rapist and you've got yourself the next New York Times Best Seller!!!<br /><br />Kindle version says it's about 432 pages and for me, this is the first time I've ever read a book this long in one day... 14 hours to be exact... I couldn't put it down... each chapter just flew by like it was telepathically implanting itself into my brain...<br /><br />So much going on in this book... but not hard to follow... dealing with childhood sexual abuse, molestation, and the ripples that affect a life later on if not dealt with.  I myself am a victim of this very same thing and while reading this and the things Eva and Gideon went through at their young ages, my heart just broke and at the same time I was getting pissed!!!  Pissed off at parents who shove things under the rug, pissed at doctors who do the same, and just pissed all the way around this... but then there's the sex... oh the sex... the hottest \\"mile high\\" sex I've ever read about... I found myself wanting to call my husband to come home for a \\"nooner!!!\\"  Unbelievable and by far the best sex scenes I've ever read in my life... throw in some hilarious humor and you're good to go!!!<br /><br />My favorite character in this series in Gideon, he's mysterious, dark and dangerous as Eva calls him... and just an all around uber hot, controlling billionaire who can dominate me anytime he wants!!  He definitely needs to deal with his past and soon.  Like Cary says, \\"He's a ticking time bomb!\\"  However, the way he gets Eva to deal with her past and how he gets her to bring it out and to the surface, I'm sure would never work for him... bwahahahaha!!!  Although he can't bring himself to say the three words... the things he does say melt my heart... like... \\"I'd rather argue with you, Angel, then laugh with anyone else!\\" or \\"I don't need anything else.  I get out of bed every morning and face the world because you're in it!\\"  Ahhhhh, he's sooooo dreamy!!!!<br /><br />Reading this in one day, I guess you could say the writing just flowed... it kept me interested at every turn.  Trust me when I say, you'd better block out and entire day or two or three depending on how fast you read, because you're not going to want anyone or anything to bother you while your living in the world of Gideon and Eva!!!<br /><br />There are too many highs and lows to mention, but one I would like to touch on is the rock star deal... HOLY HELL!!!  That part of the book I could feel a little touch of S.C. Stephen's Thoughtless and Effortless chiming in... made me feel al warm and gooey inside... AND turnabout is fair play!!!  Go get `em girl!!!<br /><br />All together... this book was simply put.... AWESOME.... It made me cry, made me laugh, made me mad as hell, and made me uber HOT... Sexy, dirty, thoughtful, HOT, and emotional... you get it all in this little 432 page book... 10 stars all the way!!!!ber hot, controlling billionaire who can dominate me anytime he wants!!

0812993292|4.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry starts with a wonderful premise. Harold Fry, a man retired from work, life, and love, receives a letter from an old friend. She is dying of cancer and wants to say goodbye, which she does in the letter. Harold writes a short response back, but when arriving at a post office box to mail it he passes along and starts walking. Eventually it is a walk which takes weeks as he becomes convinced his friend Queenie will stay alive as long as he is walking toward her.<br /><br />The walk gives Harold and his wife left at home plenty of time to consider many things. How did they live their lives, what is their relationship with their son, what is their relationship to each other? Do they love each other? What happened to the romance which bloomed early in their marriage? While the book focuses on Harold's walk, the reader is watching his wife Maureen's reaction as much as Harold's musings.<br /><br />The absurdity of the walk is one of the reasons it attracts us. Harold is not a walker before this. He is not even in shape and he is not young. He does not love nature and he does love his comforts. Yet he embarks on the walk with no clear intention, no supplies, and a pair of yachting shoes to complete several hundred miles of walking. Along the way he meets a host of characters who serve as foils to his thinking, thus pushing him forward physically and emotionally. It is in his reflections that author Rachel Joyce teeters on the cliff of \\"the obvious.\\" Just how many more things is Harold going to reflect on from his past? But just when it becomes too much, a new group of characters emerges as Harold is joined in a now public pilgrimage.<br /><br />Joyce  has a keen eye for the public and excels as she creates a cast of characters which are all too realistic next to Harold's quasi-spiritual pilgrimage. While everyone else wants to saint him we begin to see him in a new light -- a light which shows his human failings while only making him more endearing to the reader.<br /><br />In other words, Joyce has created a work in the epic tradition of the quest. From the outset of literature no theme has been more prevalent. From the Odyssey to Huckleberry Finn to to Marilynn Robinson's Gilead, the quest for something more is a reflection of a human longing. Joyce has created a character we admire because in part we want to be him. We want to seek out on a new journey with only our wits to save us (gasp--he does not even have his cell phone). We want to meet physical, emotional, and spiritual dilemmas and push through them. We want to be challenged and then succeed beyond our own expectations. Like any good quest, the Harold Fry we meet at the outset of the novel is not the Harold Fry we goodbye to at the end.<br /><br />Much of what happens or is revealed toward the end of the book alters your perception of what has occurred, so I'll resist any temptation to spoil the plot for you. If the book has any success you can count on a movie. Joyce is a playwright for the BBC and much of the book could be dropped on screen as is. This is not a critique of it since as a novel, it still works.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Expectation management: not a \\"Guns of August\\" read.  No epiphanies or innovative theme here, just a standard account of the authors military experience in the SEALs.  If purchasing this book expect firsthand accounts of operations the author was part of building up to the final operation for Bin Ladin.  Positive: the account of the Bin Ladin raid is the most through I have seen to date.  Negative: disappointing was that the author did not provide a hint of the strategic context for the raid either before, during or after.  Author certainly comes across as a heroic soldier and the book succeeds at connecting with the reader on a human level, but don't expect this book to become an authority on the topic of the Bin Ladin raid and it's implications.
B008G12ERC|4.0|Check out this exhaustive review of The 2nd Law from an independent media outlet:    [...]    Overall, it's a pretty good studio effort, but nothing earth-shattering.
B008220DIC|1.0|This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.  Boring, boring, boring, boring, with brief breaks to be disgusting before it returned to being boring.  After reading all the rave reviews, and having spent time in a somewhat cult-like religious atmosphere myself, I expected to be entertained and enlightened.  I so much wish I could get that 2 1/2 hours and $7.50 back.  Horrible, disjointed, ridiculous movie.  The only good thing is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who never disappoints with a performance.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Have played too long yet but like it so far.  Been playing each night before bed. Like that it isn't a storyline driven game. I love those kinds of games but I end up playing to long instead of going to sleep.  Nice to have this kind as an option.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great book!  If you liked Bared to You then you will definitely like it's sequel.  Only two small things kept me from giving it 5 stars.  I would give it 4.5 if I could.  First I didnt like Eva's nickname for Gideon, Ace.  It just doesn't seem to fit him at all.  Next, Is it possibly to have too much sex?  Before, I would have said no but now I'm not so sure.  Sure, it's all hot sex but dang, who could possibly have that much energy?
B0058YPL66|5.0|I didn't reckon I'd enjoy this much, I was proven wrong! I think it's a great spin on some classic tales! Well done!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I reread Bared to You in preparation for reading the sequel, and forgot what an amazing writer Sylvia Day was. I couldnt wait until October 2 to read more about Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />I really liked Eva, yes she has some issues and destructive habits, but she readily admits to them. When she flies off the handle, its always justified given her past. I remarked to a friend when I started reading that I wish Gideon had a somewhat softer and romantic side, as he was very cold throughout most of the book. But when you learn about his abuse, see what lengths he went to for Eva, and how being his cold to her at times were necessary, you can't help but fall in love.<br /><br />Like the first book, I saw some definite Fifty Shades similarities, but Sylvia Day took things to a different, and better, place. The danger and romance didn't look shoe-horned in the story like it did at times in the fifty shades trilogy. Its about two very broken people who are fighting to be together, but are very afraid of doing more damage to themselves and each other.  Christian Grey has nothing on Gideon Cross!<br /><br />The ending was amazing, kind of reminded me of the movie sixth sense where you were a little blind-sighted, but as you went back into the story it made perfect sense.  Cannot wait for the book #3 in December.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I was looking for something easy to read that would provide entertainment while riding the train to and from work.  When I first started reading this book I was a little worried that I'd made a bad choice but as I got into the book more it became quite enjoyable.  For the price you definitely can't pass this one up.
0240815807|5.0|I am currently still in the process of reading this book... So far, the book is easy to read and very informative.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|The show ran for 11 seasons and to its credit they never once aired a show with an underlying message.  There was no preaching, just pure tasteless comedy at its finest. Also, whoever is responsible for casting the actors to play the Bundy family is a genius. I cannot picture anyone else playing those characters. The only down side was the way the Fox Network cancelled the show after all those years. The actors weren't even given the courtesy of a proper sendoff. Ed O'Neil found out the show was cancelled by a couple of honeymooning fans in a hotel parking lot. To his credit, he was decent enough to bring them into the hotel bar and buy them a drink. He's a class guy who did a wonderful job playing the role of a no class guy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good book. I couldn't put it down. Had to read the next one as soon as I could. The story line keeps you interested and wanting more.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ugh! I wanted to not devour this book. and to be honest the last one was good, but i read it too soon on the heals of fifty. this book was NOTHING like fifty. it was in all aspects amazing. im just sad that we have to wait until dec 31 for the last of the three. pathetic, i know :)
B008PNBU30|5.0|First off it is not what you're used to listening to Three Days Grace...but it was great change. They threw away the playbook and brought a new sound thats more than typical chords and 00s rock. What they brought was a bunch of awesome melodic sounding tunes that I think will bring them even more fans than they had before. The writing that was getting sort of bland because they (lets be honest) always write about the same thing. Not the case in Transit Of Venus. This album has better and more thought out lyrics. Symplicity is gone which I think is good!<br /><br />A HUGE success in my opinion<br /><br />My favorite 2 tracks: The High Road and Operate. But the whole album is great.
B009KHCLIS|5.0|Say it ain't so!!! I love this show...and even though it has run its course I think they should keep going until season 9 or 10.<br /><br />I'll really miss this show when it's all over, because like so many others I have created a deep relationship with the cast and I wish the best for them!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Trite, way over the top. No character development, just a bland excuse for a plot to string together an endless sexual encounter, with sappy interludes and the same old sex, with toys to give it variety. Couldn't care less. what happened to any character in this jazzed up money maker purchased for e reader, deleted it at 63%. My eyesight is too valuable.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the most satisfying reading experiences I've had in a long time.  I read all genres, not just syfy, and this is one of the best books of any description.  The characters are well drawn and believable.  The world building is fascinating and frighteningly familiar.  The plot, the pace, and the building tension make it hard to stop reading until the thouroughly satisfying end.  Thank you Mr. Howey.  I am looking forward to reading more of your work and will be recommending Wool.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|ive gone paperless at school thanks to this great app. everything is on here so I can study on the go. and I also don't have to worry about losing everything if my kindle breaks thanks to the auto sync. its by far my most used app
0316228532|4.0|Most people are probably not going to like this. It's nothing like her H.P. series. It's clearly LITERATURE and she takes a lot of time setting up the characters.  Interesting story and I enjoyed the ending.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|Good reading - For those who likes romance, history and suspense. After The Discovery of Wicthes, you must read Shadow of Night. I've been throuhg it and I'm looking forward for the third book!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best I have read in a long time.  Finished second Catching Fire, now off to Mocking Jay.  Keeps your attention.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is more than a book that one reads once and puts back on the shelf; it's a life guide that contains powerful and practical codes to live your life by. I have used it as a daily primer for the past five years. And as life unfolds each day, the brilliant insights in the book become more applicable to how I respond to the twists and turns of each moment - the ways we respond to the world --- which ultimately becomes the fabric of our existence. I strongly recommend this poetic and powerful little book to anyone who is looking to move from where they are to where they want to be. The Four Agreements will help you take your life to the next level.
B003I55BIA|4.0|I read alot of books on my kindle.....so I always ask myself, was this one worth reading and would I read it again? Yes and no.<br /><br />The story was typical girl meets bad boy who turns good for her.  The plot was fairly predictable with no great surprises.  So while I enjoyed reading the story as the dialogue, writing, and pacing were great, the storyline didn't leave me pondering the book for days afterword - which I feel a great story does.  So this books makes for a good one night stand if you are into that sort of thing.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have seen Phantom live, and this video is better. I was blown away. I didnt think anyone could come close to Michael Crawford, but Ramin Karimloo did a great job, and this Sierra Boggess is the best Christine I've ever seen. The two of them, unsurpassed chemistry. SPECTACULAR!!!!! A must must must see for anyone, Phantom fan or not. I've been a fan for 25+ years, and this performance redefined my view of the musical. Best thing I've seen in years. Absolutely perfect.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Good book. Also an easy read. And very touching. Very sad to hear what she had to go through. Inspiring to those who have also been through a tragedy.
0345803493|5.0|Loved the whole set. The books were well written, I was very impressed. I can't wait to see what her next book is.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. The changing of card backs background its all good. And its free. And did I mention thats its free.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I am disappointed with this the second book in the series.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first one.  It would seem the author delayed the second book in the series because he ran out of things to say.  The research on the history of the time, if done, is not reflected in the text.  The historical information provided is widely known high level fact about the times with no interesting information added.  In addition, the character development is shallow.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Riveting. It brings the horror of Nazi Germany into the light once again.<br /><br />I am anxiously waiting for the third book!
B004J4WL50|5.0|This book should be a must read for any person who  wants to change the world. It was an easy read that I borrowed through my library's digital section.
0765350386|4.0|The world-building is eminently believable, the plot is full of twists and surprises, and the characters are rich, varied, and deep.  Even the Lord Ruler has some redeeming qualities.  The magic system, called Allomancy, is refreshingly original.<br /><br />  Mistborn is completely standalone, yet is the start of a trilogy.  The first 2/3 of the book is good, and the tension steadily builds towards an exciting climax.  The last third of the book is fantastic.<br /><br />  4½ Stars.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|Intelligent script; a rare movie that got the science based framework to the story accurate within current physics thought. Cinematography, music, attention to detail, props, models were well thought out and contributed toward understanding the storyline and not just time or visual filling substitutes. Costuming and makeup prosthetics (the aging of Nemo took 5 hours) were exceptional. CGI was not just pointless, make believe eye-candy but contributed important, and again intelligent, visuals to the story.<br /><br />Consequences of random butterfly effects that occur at critical periods in one's life resulting in subsequent consequences are contrasted with conscious decisions we choose to make or not to make. The three effects (random, choice & non-choice) result in a continuum of life changing outcomes. Think of a constant branching of railroad tracks that carry our train-of-life (or think of continual coin flips guiding our decision making through out life). The film shows what happens when we make those choices and what happens when we choose to do nothing and let randomness (chance) butterfly (leaf) determine the outcome.<br /><br />The movie presents us two views from our central character and his decisions: One, as an older person remembering (or perhaps imagining) the outcomes of his life's choices. Second, as a young man imagining his future lifes' outcomes.<br /><br />The movie also presents us with two states of existence for those outcomes: The first is illusionary. The second, as some physicists believe, that the past, present and future do exist for all possible outcomes -  in an infinite \\"number\\" of parallel universes. We, as viewers, are to decide which is true or perhaps \\"Every path is the right path.\\"<br /><br />Guide: The movie shows all three choices starting when Nemo was a young man.  Who he chooses to be his love for life. To make it easy to follow each choice of love-life-path they are each color and film technique coded. Red, yellow and bluefor each female, and camera angles and focus differ for each female.<br />A leaf in the movie is our stand-in butterfly.<br /><br />Kudos to the international cooperative approach in making the film: Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, UK, Canada, USA.<br /><br />My only science based disagreement is when the Universe reverses it's expansion (we are assuming a sudden disappearance of Dark Energy) that time, since it's interwoven with space, also reverses, i.e. rewinds (entropy becomes reconstructive) - not likely. My other criticism is how entertainment (e.g. movie) can be for \\"Tax Shelter Investors\\".
B0063GORYU|4.0|I've just begun playing & am staying with one suit (have tried 2 once).  The positive reinforcement of being told \\"fastest game yet\\" or \\"least time taken\\" etc.  keeps me playing - positively addictive.
1935182617|4.0|The iText library is a bit too preoccupied with pass editing.  There's too much event oriented code.  In contrast, Adobe Illustrator has no issues opening up a complex PDF and offering full editing tools in place.  In my opinion, the iText API design is more than a little off.  The code is heavy.  Namespace conflicts occur left and right.  (YARC- Yeah, another rectangle class)<br /><br />The javadocs are non-existent.  Even the parameters aren't documented well.  Example:<br />\\"public void addTemplate(PdfTemplate template, float a, float b, float c, float d, float e, float f)<br />Adds a template to this content. \\"<br /><br />This book won't solve many of the javadoc shortcomings.  It's a little too much cookbook on the simple obvious items, and not enough detail on the esoteric.<br /><br />STILL, iText is likely the finest Java PDF API out there.  Definitely a love hate relationship, but if you're going to use it, you'll need this book.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love and have played dozens of big fish games and this was great on my kindle! Literally hours of fun a great story and tons of hidden object puzzles. If you've never played HOG games this is a great first one. hints are fast and you can click them to see where to go next. the map is also very useful.
B007THA4FI|4.0|If you have any interest in this book, ignore the star rating on Amazon. Most of the low ratings seem to be from people who either wanted a muggle version of Harry Potter, are upset about the price, or are outraged that there is adult content in a book written for adults. Either find a review from a publication you trust or just get the book from the library.<br /><br />My rating is based on my genuine enjoyment of the book. This is a study of characters, their secrets, and how their lives intertwine with each other.  The draw of this story isn't the main plot, it's how you become invested in these people and the intentional and unintentional consequences of their choices.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow, just wow!!  At midnight on October 2nd anxiously awaiting for the download to my kindle, I started devouring Reflected In You. It was sooo worth staying up all night for. Sylvia Day is over the top when it comes to sensual romance. One of my top five authors. Can't wait for Entwined In You! Hurry up December 31.
B007RFJ4QM|4.0|The movie is interesting. A Good Mark Wahlberg vehicle, not as good as Shooter<br />but an OK movie none the less. I would recommend watching the movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very addicting game! I enjoy playing daily. I just wish that you could add friends more quickly and send and receive gifts easily.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I love this movie because it's CGI. The graphic effects and the movement of<br />this move are really great. It is a fun movie and enjoyable for the whole family.<br />I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I read this book telling myself that here was a new author with a new book. I was well aware that this would not be a similar offering from a well known author of a particular genre. However, I did expect the creativity and imagination that this author is justly famous for.<br />Nearly a century ago Agatha Christie created the town of St. Mary's Mead with Miss Marple (whose mind was compared to a kitchen sink).  Pagford of this book is a 21st century version. As with Christie, who had some equally uni-dimensional characters as this author has created, small town indiscretions are supposed to enthrall us and have us extrapolate this so called microcosm of society to the wider world. However, while Christie was entertaining and fun with no pretensions to \\"world changing\\" or \\"intellectual commentary\\", this was one grim, boring, pointless peroration.<br />I am amazed that swearing, sex (mind-numbingly boring gropes), equally boring fantasies, thoughts of petty revenge for petty grievances and plain old boring gossip, makes this an 'adult' book.<br />I appreciate the author's desire to show us she is capable of more than what we expect of her but this is certainly not it.
1612680011|5.0|I am amazed that this doesn't have at LEAST 4 stars.  I guess a lot of people were looking for that elusive quick answer to the question \\"how do i get rich the fastest that doesn't require a lot of time out of my day?\\"  Fact is people, just like there isn't a magic pill to make you instantly lose 50 lbs or a pill to add inches to Mr. Johnson (despite there actually being a market for this and people actually buy into it) there is no divine answer or step 1, 2, 3 on how to get rich.  Acquiring wealth is all about your lifestyle and not about an instruction booklet on how to get there.  This book is telling how you should approach life with a new mindset, not how to go from zero dollars to a millionaire overnight.... or even in the course of a year.  I hate to break it to you, no such book exists.  Why this book is excellent IMO though is that it wakes you up on how much money you are likely currently wasting on such things like material objects and bills.<br /><br />Here is my experience after I bought this book in 2006:<br /><br />After reading this book I sold my car privately and got $7,000.  Used 5,000 to pay off the remainder of the loan and took the 2,000 left over along with 5 grand a saved up and bought a 4 year old used Toyota with 80,000 miles on it for $7000.  NO CAR PAYMENT.  I instantly saved $250 a month from that point forward.  Doing nothing in less than 2 years I made my $5,000 back in saved car payment money alone.  I didn't stop there though because I then looked around for other pointless bills.  Obvious pointless bill #2 was my landline phone.  That was only $17/month I saved but that means an extra $200 a year roughly.  Then I ditched my ATT wireless plan that I was paying $80/month for and switched to Virgin Mobile and pay only $38 a month with tax.  About $40 savings/month right there.  Then I quit buying groceries at Walmart and started going to Aldis.  About $40 savings a month there.  I quit buying new shirts at department stores and started searching thrift stores for quality shirts (Plato's Closet sells used name brand clothing for like $4 a shirt so you'll still look \\"hip\\").  That's hard to quantify savings/month but still - MORE SAVINGS.  Then instead of bi***ing about there being nothing good on TV.... EVER I ended my satellite service and switched to Netflix.  Saved about $60/month there.  I'd say in all I probably save about $600+/month now just by not paying pointless bills and making an easy to live by budget which really had no life altering after effects, meaning the changes really didn't change my day to day life.<br /><br />Point of this story is that this new mindset was acquired through this book.  Yes some of the stuff is obvious like ditching the landline but I am still amazed at all the people still tethered to their iPhones paying for their $100+/month plans.  And the people who still drive cars they have to make car payments on.  With this additional savings I pay myself first now which is the main message (I think) this book sends out.  But I didn't stop there.  The book also goes into a little about investing and provides some tips there.  I ended up taking his advice and bought a couple of gold and silver bars from my dad's friend's Gold and Silver/pawn shop.  This was in 2008.  I bought this with the money I was now saving.  If you pay attention to the markets you know that since 2008 gold and silver has doubled in value.  The BEST investment I ever made..... so far.<br /><br />This book isn't going to instantly make you rich just by reading it.  Osmosis isn't going to work here or ever.  You're actually going to have to get up and practice what is preached in this book.  For the people saying it is a scam and that Kiyosaki is just a salesman clearly don't realize that he doesn't need to do this.  He makes millions on his owned real estate and investments alone.  I mean this book is on Amazon is $5.  How is that scamming you?  Is this book unlocking a hidden room of riches?  No.  It is just teaching you how to approach life.  Some say it is obvious what he says.  Then why haven't these people made any money?  I have.  And I have yet to start investing in real estate.  I'm in college now (spent 6 years in the Navy which is when I read this book on a deployment) so I don't plan on investing in real estate until I get my degree in accounting and then get CPA qualified so I can one day work from home (another tip from the book) - one day in the not too distant future is the plan.  Once I get a job somewhere though is when I plan on buying my first foreclosure.  For some people they will just discredit the book and not even attempt to practice what is said.  Notice how they just discredit it and not provide any proof as to why it is garbage.  They usually just attack Kiyosaki and say he is just another \\"get rich quick\\" scam artist.  The fact that they say this makes me wonder if they even read the book because he clearly says this stuff ain't going to happen over night.  These people knocking the book either haven't read it, or did and never actually attempted to practice what it preaches.  Since I bought this book in 2006 I have bought a couple of his other books which are equally as valuable IMO but aren't necessary.  I've also been reading up on real estate tax laws, landlording, and other investment books (It's called prep work people - you just don't dive into the deep end if you don't know how to swim).  Some of them are of inferior content but I think Rich Dad books are pretty solid for the most part.  AGAIN, this book is going to be useless if you don't follow through.  This book I think is the ground level of knowledge you need to start out with if you really want to start making changes in your financial life.  I'd also recommend buying his Financial IQ book.
B0031RS64G|4.0|If you're looking for easy to read light-weight fantasy - this book is not for you. I found it an interesting, intricate complex read where the plot was anything but predictable and the characterizations and dialog rich, complex and totally engaging.<br />One of the aspects that I enjoyed was the blurring of good and bad - there are no clear hero's and villains here - its much more complex as they are following their paths & agenda. Perhaps this grey-ness and lack or good vs. evil is what some readers find difficult to cope with.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|Hotel Transylvania, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky from a screenplay by Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel, is an animated comedy/horror-spoof, mostly for the kids but fast-paced enough and with enough humor to keep everyone entertained for an hour and a half. It's not as smartly written as 2010's Megamind or as sophisticated and dazzling as 2011's Rango, but it is fun to watch and satisfying in a popcorn-movie kind of way. Adult fans of old horror films will like spotting some of the more obscure monsters (Brain From Planet Arous anyone?) and picking up on some references that will sail over the head of younger viewers.<br /><br />The plot begins in 1895 where we find a very paternal Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) looking after his infant daughter not long after the death of his wife. Determined to keep her safe from \\"the humans\\", Dracula comes up with an idea - to create a sanctuary, a place where monsters of all kinds can come to relax and be themselves without having to constantly worry about humanity coming after them with torches and pitchforks. He directs his servants to convert an old medieval castle hidden deep in the remotest part of Transylvania into a resort/retreat for monsters from all over the world, and voila! - the Hotel Transylvania is born.  The hotel is staffed, appropriately, by zombie bellhops, haunted suits of armor, housekeeping witches and talking shrunken heads, with a kitchen overseen by an obsessed lunatic chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz) and his pet rat Esmeralda.<br /><br />Of course the years seem to fly by for a parent, even an immortal one, and before Dracula knows it suddenly it's 2012 and the day of Mavis's 118th birthday (that's 18 in human-growth years). The castle is filled with guests, many of them old friends of the family who've come especially for the occasion, including a very domestic Frankenstein (Kevin James) and his high-bouffant wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), a life-of-the-party mummy named Murray (CeeLo Green), a very frazzled werewolf named Wayne (Steve Buscemi in superb form), his highly-pregnant wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their pack of snarling hyper-active wolf kids, and Griffin, the Invisible Man (David Spade) who can't understand why he sucks at playing charades.<br /><br />But this is also a day Dracula has dreaded as he promised Mavis (Selena Gomez) that on the day she turned 118, she had his permission to go out into the world. Compelled to keep his word but unable to face the prospect of Mavis going off into what he feels is a world too dangerous for her, he concocts a scheme to scare her into wanting to stay at the castle. Which works, somewhat to his surprise. But his scheme turns out to have unintended consequences and before Dracula has time to feel relieved, the unthinkable happens - a _human_ suddenly appears at the hotel, a young backpacker named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) who \\"heard about this cool old castle\\" and wanted to check it out. Panicking, and fearing for the reputation of his hotel if it were found out that a human was on the premises, Dracula quickly disguises Jonathan as \\"Johnny-stein\\", a supposed cousin of Frankenstein (actually just a cousin of Frankenstein's right hand, as it were). But before Dracula can get Jonathan out of the castle and out of his hair, Mavis and Jonathan meet and \\"zing!\\" it's love at first sight. The rest of the plot is rather predictable - over-protective father wants to keep boy away from his daughter, but daughter and boy keep seeing each other - but the pacing is kept fast enough and the humor abundant enough that it keeps things fresh and funny all the way through.  Particularly in scenes where Johnny's fun-loving nature livens things up by inadvertently starting a horses-and-riders pool fight, introducing some new music over the grumbling protests of zombie-Beethoven, zombie-Mozart & zombie-Bach, and engages Dracula in a floating-table race, causing the stiff and stuffy Count to unexpectedly rediscover what fun is.<br /><br />Theanimation, while not ground-breaking, is well done, with a lot of attention to detail which gives the film a level of texture you wouldn't ordinarily expect in a light comedy. For example, at one point Mavis leads Johnny into a cave, the entrance to which some horror aficionados will recognize is shaped like the face of the Phantom of the Opera.  While Genndy Tartakovsky is well known for his work producing several successful TV animated series (Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, The Grimm Adventures of Billy & Mandy, The Powerpuff Girls and Star Wars: The Clone Wars), Hotel Transylvania is his first feature film.  Fans of Tartakovsky 's TV work might be expecting something more in the distinctive style he used in those shows, but I don't think they'll be disappointed with his choice to be more traditional here. The production design was done by Marcelo Vignali, who worked on several Disney films including Mulan and Lilo & Stich as well as Cloudy With Chance Of Meatballs, and the art direction was done by Ron Lukas and Noelle Triaureau, both of whom also worked with Vignali on 2007's Surf's Up.<br /><br />The voice cast is excellent.  Adam Sandler, whom I don't usually care for as a rule, is actually quite good as the over-protective fatherly Dracula.  Andy Samberg brings out Johnny's guileless but ever-upbeat goofiness in a very winning way, while Selena Gomez brings the perfect touch as Mavis, the teenage vampire cutie who loves her dad and all his old weird friends but just wants to get out there and see the world she's only heard stories about.  Kevin James does an affable Frankenstein, and Fran Drescher is perfect as his loud and brassy Franken-wife, Eunice. CeeLo Green's Murray is the liveliest and hippest mummy you've ever heard.  As always though, it's Steve Buscemi who gets the best lines (or who makes his lines the best ones by his inimitably wry delivery) as the much put-upon buttoned-down-shirt-and-tie-wearing werewolf Wayne.  One of my favorite scenes is where Dracula, Frank and Wayne are trying to track down Johnny.  Dracula wants Wayne to follow his scent, and Wayne can only sigh wearily and ask \\"Do you have _any_ idea what years of changing poopy diapers have done to this nose?\\"<br /><br />Recommended as a fun enjoyable film for everyone and in particular for classic horror-film fans.animation, while not ground-breaking, is well done, with a lot of attention to detail which gives the film a level of texture you wouldn't ordinarily expect in a light comedy.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I liked this book very much and felt that the omnibus edition on Kindle was one of the best ways to present this work to the public. While I cannot say that I am expert on postapocalyptic narratives it seems as if most are oriented to extraverted experiences. For instance, the world goes \\"boom\\" and the intrepid hero goes out to fight zombies or something.<br /><br />In the world of \\"Wool\\", Mr. Howey pulls us inward to the claustrophobic arena of humans trying to survive underground. This atmosphere created interesting psychological pressures within the protagonist which were also reflected among the surrounding characters. The book ends on a fairly satisfying note, but it is clear that the author has left himself plenty of room to continue this series.<br /><br />My only issues with hhis series was that it started off slowly and occasionally lapsed into long heavy prose that took some time to wade through. However, once plot got moving I found my attention engaged without distraction. Plot turns and \\"secrets\\" were revealed slowly and described well.<br /><br />One thing I appreciated most was the careful proofing and editing of these books. Too often, independent writers seem to rush their manuscript to press without cleaning them up. The typos and grammatical errors can really erode a potentially good read.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful despite sounding generic. I think that offering spoilers in a review for this book would do it a disservice, but I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00571F26Y|1.0|I have had no wheat or wheat-containing products for over a month. It has done nothing for me. I am diabetic and tried it to get better blood sugar numbers. I have been carefully watching carbs for several years, so changed nothing except the no wheat program. As for weight loss, I have not lost any \\"wheat belly\\" and am exactly where I was...varying 2-4 lbs. from day to day. So, at this point I cant say I have benefited at all from the rigid elimination of wheat from my diet.
B005LAIGPU|1.0|Andrew's mom is sick. His dad was a firefighter, now he's a drunk. Andrew is considered a bit of a geek at school which is compounded when he decides to carry a video camera everywhere and film everything.<br /><br />His cousin Matt talks him into going to a rave. Then Matt and his friend Steve stumble on a strange hole. They talk Andrew into filming as they explore the hole, cave and what it contains. What is in the cave can't be explained, yet gives them strange powers and brings out their dark side.<br /><br />Most of the movie is filmed from Andrew's viewpoint--literally--as though he is filming the movie himself. As a result the story is raw and gritty. This filming style is not my taste and I found it rather boring. However, it is a pretty good illustration of the pent up anger kids can have if they face verbal and/or physical abuse at home and/or school. Especially if no one takes the time or energy to truly care.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I almost didn't buy this book after seeing a large number of bad reviews.  Personally I thought the book was interesting in scope.  As a Reacher fan I felt the pacing of the book was off.  This book felt like Child was going for a more crebral mystery.  This is fine except for the fact that Reacher is not a cerebral hero.  I felt the first half of the book dragged with setting up the scenario.  Hopefully Child will do better with his next book and bring things back to what makes Reacher a great read.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I have not read this book and do not intend to read it because I think the publisher has priced it too high for the Kindle. I love reading Kindle books, but the price should be lower because the books can not be shared. If I buy the book for just a few more dollars, I can share it with anyone I'd like. I prefer the Kindle version, but I think it's wrong to charge so much for an electronic book.
0307887960|4.0|I was totally against going on another diet, but my husband read about this on the internet and pitched it because our son wanted all three to lose some weight together as a new year's resolution. We started by listening to the book on audible.com then ordered the printed version here on Amazon. You really need the lists of allowed foods and such in the written version. We began the diet on January 15th of 2012 and I have now lost 102 lbs and I'm still losing. My husband has lost nearly 70 lbs while my son has dropped 50 lbs.<br /><br />  I had been on all of the diets, you name it and I had tried it. I have lost and gained countless lbs. but each time I gained back the weight with interest, so when I tell you this is different please believe me. I say that with a vast amount of experience not only do the pounds come off quickly but you aren't hungry. The difference is in your body is noticeable right away so you are constantly motivated by your own results. It makes the daily food decisions so much easier because you are rewarded for good choices right away instead of the small weekly losses in other diets.<br /><br />  I was actually considering weight loss surgery before trying the Dukan Diet. I'm losing weight through diet and exercise just as fast as I was expected to lose with the surgery. I'm not sure this guy is the best writer I've read but he did succeed in convincing me this could be done and also taught me/us how to do it. We simply read the book and when we had questions we looked on the internet, there are so many others who are doing this and sharing their stories on the web. I was greatly encouraged to find so many women in my age range losing large amounts of weight sharing their stories on blogs and other sites. I don't know if you can ask any more of a diet or a diet book.<br /><br />  There have been countless changes in my body and my health with losing this much weight. My doctor has taken me off most of the medications I was on and my husbandhas seen the same kind of positive results. I look forward to getting to the next step in the diet but not because of adding in foods that will be allowed but because of this new lease on life as the smaller healthier me. This really works don't let anyone who hasn't given it a real try tell you different!

B008H6GHL0|4.0|There's a nice trailer to RE6 in the credits. The story line is decent but failed to execute in a few areas, like the young soldier kid who carried a flask, his youth just didn't translate well to CGI, I don't know why but it just seemed off. The rest of the characters worked well. One of these days they'll get to Beowolf level production and these movies will really shine. It's better than degeneration, lots of neat action, some real innovative camera work with the lickers and even Leon's \\"gun cam\\", the red dot looked good. I wish it was a little shorter but over all I'm glad I rented this and glad I didn't spend $15 to own the DVD. For what it's worth, it was enjoyable.

I'm just glad to see the blu-ray will have the shifting aspect ratio to expand to 1.78 for the Imax scenes. I only read through some of the reviews on here and surprised I didn't see any mention of it. I know there are many people like me that like the ratio shift (and some who don't) so just thought I would mention it for those who don't know. If you zoom the back cover you can see the specs - 2.4:1 and 1.78:1 (Imax sequences). Nice!!!

There were way too many characters and I couldn't keep them all straight.  But more importantly, I didn't really care to.  None of the characters were interesting - they all seemed so depressing!  So yeah, I didn't finish it, and even if you tell me it all makes sense in the end, I won't be picking it up again.  At least we'll always have Harry....
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This quirky, funny and clever novel follows the present and past adventures of the endearing Swedish centenarian, Allan Karlsson. Less than an hour before his 100th birthday celebration, Allan climbs out of the ground floor window of his nursing home with no real plan other than to avoid all the fuss. Contemplating his next move at the local bus station, he is asked to mind a young man's suitcase and hoping it's contents may be useful, absconds with it on the next bus out of town. What follows is an absurd adventure as Allen is hunted by the criminal gang who wants the $50million crowns in the grey suitcase back and the police concerned for his well being, all the while collecting unusual allies in his wake.<br /><br />Allan's life, we learn, is characterised by an extraordinary mix of luck and hubris. Endlessly optimistic and resourceful, as Allan travels across Sweden with the grey suitcase variously accompanied by a master thief, a hot dog seller, a red headed woman who spews profanity and an elephant named Sonya, we learn of his astounding personal history. Once an orphaned explosives expert, Allan's skill and his willingness to go wherever life takes him leads him around the globe at the behest of presidents, prime ministers and world leaders. Primarily motivated by good food and vodka, the apolitical, atheist Allen unwittingly plays a integral part in key moments of history from the creation of the Atom Bomb to preventing the assassination of Winston Churchill and giving Richard Nixon the idea that lead to the Watergate Scandal. The intertwining past and present narratives work wonderfully to create a picture of Allan's incredible life and somehow, despite the preposterous connections and unlikely predicaments, it is a journey that seems perfectly plausible.<br /><br />Translated from the author's native Swedish, the writer's voice has a unique tone that works beautifully with the black humor and wry observation in this novel. The pace is excellent as Jonasson skillfully blends historical fact with fanciful fiction, eccentric comedy with social commentary.<br /><br />It's fitting that I read The One Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window and Disappeared sipping on a Vodka 'Cruiser', I only wish I could have shared it with Allan. Charming, sharp and inventive, this novel has earned a place on my favourites list and comes with my sincere recommendation.skillfully blends historical fact with fanciful fiction, eccentric comedy with social commentary.<br /><br />It's fitting that I read The One Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window and Disappeared sipping on a Vodka 'Cruiser', I only wish I could have shared it with Allan.

0525953728|5.0|I was impressed with how matter of fact the Seals are about their job. They are given a target,they don't question it,they just get it done in a very efficient way. I was also impressed with the description of the physical shape must be in to take care of business.  I looked for \\"classified\\" material but am not sure I would know it if I saw it. The fact that they built an exact replica of Osama's compound was truly eye opening and showed they would get him no matter what it took. To say the least I enjoyed this book and read, \\"devoured\\" it in two and a half days.  I also read American Sniper, these men are very special and there is no way we can ever repay them for what they do.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I liked the book but feel it does not meet the high interest standard that I have found in other Follett books. Definitely did not hold my interest like the first book of the trilogy. The Fall of Giants had more history. The last few chapters finally brought it all together. I look forward to the next book of the trilogy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was excited to see the delivery to my kindle, i have been up late just reading. I love the connection that Gideon and Eva have, they can both relate to pain from their past. I understand how Eva really lets her emotions get to her, and at times it would upset me that she was that way. In the first book i really was a bit too annoyed with the wording during their therapy sessions, so i liked that they weren't so wordy this time around. I feel that Eva has grown as a person and i was hoping to see her use the Krav Maga more than once. I felt that the book sort of dragged in some parts, but overall the character development that Gideon had was great. I have been reading a bunch of books lately, but he is the first male lead that i see is not afraid to change his ways. Stubborn at times, but ultimately I see a true change in him. I cannot wait until the third book, i hope we find out more about Gideon. Since we found out about Eva so quickly, i was disappointed that his story was abruptly cut short. Overall i will be patiently waiting until Dec 31 and greet the new year reading the final book. :)
0316228532|4.0|J.K. Rowling's The Casual Vacancy is raw realism, with \\"adult\\" themes: sex (not all consensual) drug addiction, cutting, not to mention smoking, drinking and profanity; also betrayal and death. Oh, yes, it is also about local politics and about responsibility for the outcast and addicted. There are many characters, few of them at all appealing, but vivid just the same. To understand what Rowling is doing here, one should remember two things: she grew up in the same part of England she is centering her story on here; and, more importantly, her favorite author was Jane Austen, who was interested in character and human relations above all.<br /><br />Among the many characters--and I needed to make myself a dramatis personae to keep them straight--notably who was married to whom--are five sixteen year olds, none of whom get on well with their parents, but--one in particular-- on whom the most important dramatic parts of the plot revolve. Accordingly, although this is surely not a book for young children, one assumes that it will be read by readers the age of these sixteen year olds, and there is no reason why it should not be
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I may be the minority here, but I did not like this books as I had hoped to.  I felt as though I had whiplash while reading it;hot-cold, up-down, on-off, passive-aggressive, etc.  I wanted soo much more from this book but I did not get it.  Gideon and Eva are exhausting!  You want soo much for them and their relationship to evolve in a positive manner.  Their relationship, in my opinion, is delvalued a bit in this book with a huge emphasis on the sex.  It almost made it seem like that was all they had and their wasn't much more to it.  There was soo much more to their relationship and it was profound, but it wasn't always portayed that way.  Gideon continues to control and dominate.  He expects Eva to share soo much, yet doesn't share himself emotionally and when it comes to his past.  Eva is soo weak in this book and dependent upon Gideon until the end.  She is also childish and immature in many ways and lashes out with another man; an old flame.  I did not like that at all.  Gideon has his issues but when you realize what he has done for her and sacrificed, you think Eva is not deserving of him.  Yes, that's what I said. There is no trust until the end.  Gideon's past is still unknown.  A bit is revealed at the end.  There are still soo many unanswered questions.  The ending was not strong, especially after all they had been through and left me feeling bereft.  I don't know how the author is going to address Gideon's past, answer all the unanswered questions and then bring our couple towards a happy ending (marriage, babies, etc.) in the last book.

B008LY9AWG|5.0|I agree with the one reviewer who said that she would read Michael's grocery list if he published it. He is my favorite writer and I read and reread his stories, until the next one comes out. I somehow cannot get too interested in other writers, something about the stories Michael writes that make you hunger for more. Before, I read Michael's stories, I read Joseph Wambaugh but he quit for quite awhile and then I met Michael. Sorry, Joseph while I like your new series (Hollywood Station, etc) they do not hold a candle to any new Connelly in my opinion.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was fantastic!  I don't give out 5 stars easily or often and when I do it's only to those books that really make me feel something and have something original to offer.  Slammed does both of those things.<br /><br />First, a comment on the cover.  I was not blown away by it.  I admit it.  I'm a little bit of a cover whore.  If it's pretty, I'm drawn to it.  This cover just did not scream \\"Read me!\\"  Now however, after reading it, I understand it and think it's fitting.  So, if you're like me and are a little bit hesitant because of the cover, don't be!<br /><br />As for the content of the book, this was one of my favorites so far this year.  The blurb was a little bit vague and I also don't want to give anything away so I'll try hard to avoid spoilers here.  Our main character, Layken, is an 18 year old high school senior who recently lost her father to an unexpected heart attack.  As a result, she moves with her mother and brother back to her mom's hometown.  Her little brother makes friends with the boy across the street and she meets his older brother, Will.  They feel an immediate connection.<br /><br />Ok, let me stop there.  Yes, there is some insta-love going on here.  This was the one aspect of this story that I didn't really care for.  There is almost no progression of relationship here.  They meet, they immediately fall madly in love.  Normally, this is a huge no-no for me.  This just does not happen in real life.  Maybe I'm a little bit jaded but I do not believe in love at first sight.  Lust at first sight, maybe, but not love at first sight.  I think relationships can start off hot and heavy but for there to be any real depth of feeling there needs to be some growth between the characters.  I almost took away a star because of this.<br /><br />The saving grace was Ms. Hoovers writing.  It was exceptional and was so good that this book deserves all 5 stars despite the instant attraction between Layken and Will.  She did a fantastic job of showing emotion through the characters and illustrating those emotions through actions and scenes rather than just telling the reader about them.  There were quite a few scenes that made me just ache for the characters and still others that had me outright crying.<br /><br />There is also poetry in this book.  Don't be intimidated or turn away because of it.  I myself am not a huge fan of poetry and don't always find it easy to read or relateable.  Here, though, the poetry only enhances the story and, in fact, adds to the plot by giving us insight into each of the characters.  It is readable and easy to understand while still being powerful and poignant.<br /><br />This was a fantastic book and I will be trying to get my hands on the next book as soon as I can.  I cannot wait to read Point of Retreat.<br /><br />Note: I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.  All opinions are 100% my own.ng emotion through the characters and illustrating those emotions through actions and scenes rather than just telling the reader about them.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very very entertaining...I will pass this series on.  I'm a sap for happy endings and love the action.  Suzanne Collins has captured my attention and I will read more of her works.  :-)
B0070NSPCU|5.0|All I have to say is READ IT! I am a big fan already. The only other author that has written a story that has taken ahold of me like this is George RR Martin (you guessed it Song of Ice and Fire and Fevre Dream). I can not wait until book two comes out.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved the continuing story of Eva and Gideon...wow Gideon so sexy his love for Eva so powerful,obsessive, addicting but so sweet, amazing....but Eva and Gideon so destructive for each other but also so made for each other working to heal each other..love their story can't wait for the conclusion of their story...waiting for the next book....

B009CPIR9K|4.0|Well done movie with top notch special effects and acting was well done. It's NOT a comedy and was never promoted as one, yes there some satire etc. The movie moves at a good pace and all in all well done. Could it have been better ... sure, many movies can be. For a B movie it's incredibly well done, it almost deserves a A.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest but hate that this particular app force closes so often. Hopefully there will be an update released soon that corrects this issue.

B0087YYHZU|5.0|I think that this is a great musical classic.  When I was a teenager, I went to see this movie, and because Debbie<br />Reynolds was my favorite actress and still is, I enjoyed it all the more.  Love musicals.  I have met Debbie Reynolds, so this movie means alot to me.  Donald O'Connor is one of the great dancers, I think of all times.  I enjoy watching over and over.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Yes, I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting Ken's third and final trilogy book. I wish I could give WINTER 6 stars ******  instead of only 5.<br />He has such a great technique of reminding the reader about the character (of which there are many) he is presently referring  without over-discussing him or her or the situation every time he brings them into focus. You, then,remember them or the situation he is referring.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|We open up right where Eva and Gideon left off in Bared to You. The title of the book does NO justice. Eva and Gideon are each others addiction, obsessio, possession, just meant for each other. WARNING: Many readers are saying the plot seems forced. Keep in mind, Eva and Gideon have each suffered tramatic events in their lives, the way they REACT to everything has everything to do with their pasts and how they handle their lives. I wonder if Sylvia has a phsychologist in her back pocket when she wrote this book. These characteristics are common for people who have suffered tramas and loss the way Eva and Gideon have, please keep that in mind when you read the book. The \\"forced\\" plot is actually an emotion a reader should feel, because they are fighting to finally have good in their lives. I can't say anything more about this without leaving spoilers.<br /><br />So the title of the book does totally fit, Eva and Gideon reflect each other with what they give away and what they don't. The book takes their story to a whole new level and in a direction that I was not expecting! Such an awesome twist! We get to know Eva and Gideon a little more, they get to know each other a little more. There is no doubt they love each other, they just have a different way to their love. Its raw, hurtful, and yet nurturing, caring, and soft at the same time.<br /><br />I love Gideon and his protective, posessiveness, wanton, eagerly willing animalistic nature. Eva, is such a girl!! A girl with a spine of steel, that is not willing ot be walked all over with out a fight, and damn it she will fight for her man! YES! And Gideon will do anything for his Angel.<br /><br />I can not wait until December with Entwined with You is released!
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy is an easy read, yet engaging.  I highly recommend these books as long as you are not a prude.  If you are offended by sex, please steer clear, this series is not for you.  But if on the other hand you are an open minded reasonable adult, then this book will take you on a journey of what it means to really love someone, what passion can do for a relationship and how trust and understanding lead to happiness.  If everyone could experience love like this, the world would be a much better place.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|This record may not have the \\"ot of control\\" punk/trash feel\\" of their previous records, but it is a solid rocker. I read all of the negative reviews (there are equally 5 star reviews on other sites)expecting the worst. It is different. The guitars shine though as do the lyrical content. Much deeper. \\"Pedaled out guitar riffs\\", heavy bass guitar, toned down vox would be my description. Minus 2 ballads I hated, the record is outstanding imo. Favorite track, Give It To ME....Freaking SIC.......
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is amazing!  I finished this book in just a few hours because I was so drawn into it.  I wasn't sure that another book could equal Bared to You, but this book exceeded those expectations.  I am not even sure where to begin on all the things I loved about it.  First off, this follow up was way beyond what I was expecting.  I loved how the story picked up seamlessly and continued on the roller coaster that is Eva and Gideon. This author did an outstanding job of carrying on this story without making the story repetitive of the first story, so to speak.  The author also kept the story very interesting and left me guessing as to what would happen next, when Eva's past came back to haunt her.  I loved the addition of the new characters, they added just enough to make the story all the more interesting.  Also, it was very nice to be able to finally see some of Gideon's past, not much but some, just enough to keep one guessing again.  Sylvia Day has out done herself with this follow up book, I am once again highly anticipating the next book!
B008133DO8|5.0|Everything about this series is brilliant. The modern twist upon a classic character does not destroy him in the least. I have read every single Sherlock Holmes story written by Doyle. However, I can say even though these have a slightly different take on Sherlock, they are still really capturing the essence of him. I can not begin to tell you how much I have been loving this series. I can not wait for the next season to come out.
0345803485|1.0|50 shades of bad. Bad writing, bad editing, poor construction, unbelievable characters, threads left hanging, repetitive, with no real conclusions. This is the worst book I have ever read - without exception. People, please save your time and money for something worthwhile. The author's voice is that of an immature 16 year old. The endless orgasms quickly lose appeal. I am no prude and sex does not offend me - but these poorly written and unbelievable sexual encounters are inane and endless.
B00834R580|5.0|i have no words to describe this whole season of sherlock, he was robbed of the emmy and notable mention to Luther!

B005LAII80|1.0|This is one of the worse films I have ever seen! This movie should had been Direct To DVD! I can't believe this movie made it to the big screen. What were they thinking? The movie focuses on too much on the look and how it is filmed. Everything else is subpar.<br /><br />So, what can I say, the action was okay, but it could had been better. Dredd basically goes to this one building and is trapped inside. That makes it basically one location in the whole movie and nothing other places until the end, which was the same other location in the start of the movie. Also, he doesn't ever take off his helmet from beginning to the end. For some strange reason, the makers didn't feel like we needed to see the face of Dredd. Maybe he is too ugly? I don't know. lol<br /><br />The direction of the film is slowww and boring! The story was retarded. There is no need to watch this film and doesn't even come close to buying it. Save your money! You thank me later.

B002VISNAS|5.0|I am a huge fan of Gladwell. I loved the Tipping Point. The man seems to spend his time observing the obvious - yet in doing so he seems to see things others don't see. Once he talks about it, one can't help but become aware of what he is saying. Ah well I am blithering here, but I want to say that I recommend this and all Gladwells books. Wrong or right, he does give one something to think about. Intuition is something that has been around forever, but Gladwell explains it.
B007BVOF8E|2.0|Perhaps a good read would have served my needs better than the evening that I watched Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. The acting itself was pretty well done, but, the story was portrayed, in my opinion, in a convoluted manner causing it to lose the depth and quality that I expected. SMS

B008673ZAQ|2.0|I love, love, love the first book.  I rated it 5 stars.  I reread parts this summer.  So I was really looking forward to the second book in the trilogy.<br /><br />Who wrote this one?  This was all sex.  The dialog and plot were interesting in the first book.  Here is the plot for the second book - sex, sex, you are keeping secrets, sex, sex.<br /><br />The Nathan and Corrine stories were interesting, and could have been the focus, rather than just an accompaniment to six or more sex acts a night.  Come on.  When I reviewed the first book, I said it was much better than fifty shades.  Well, this is just like fifty shades.  I am rating it a little higher because it wasn't wrtten as poorly as fifty shades.<br /><br />I realize we were all waiting with baited breath for this book.  But I feel it was rushed.  I just read the same sex acts over and over.  I like my erotica as part of a story, not AS the story.<br /><br />This book was so formulaic.  Insert part about loving NY.  Insert sex sceene.  Have fight about keeping secrets.  Insert sex sceen.  Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />I'm sure someone will rewrite this book as fan fiction.  I look forward to reading that, because this just left me feeling ripped off and slightly dirty afterward.  I wasn't reading an erotic romance - I was reading erotica.  Sex acts with no context just don't do it for me.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|I went home screaming after listening to this Beyonce album! Glad I did not purchase this, just borrowed it from a friend and they actually gave it to me and told me to keep it. Now I know why! The broken guitar on the back cover is very appropriate because there is no guitars played on this album. I went home screaming in a bad way and not with tears of joy! I did my friend a favor and torched this album for him, pitched it in the fire as i heard the plastic and aluminum and paper scream out of the flame! This is a really good example of what happens when an artist gets off of drugs! Mistakes happen. Bring back Temple of The Dawg!

0374214913|5.0|From the first pages to the last, this refreshing, original, imaginative, thoughtful - and often humorous - debut novel kept me glued to the chair, completely charmed by the novel's style, an unusual mix of ephemera and cutting edge computer science.  I was totally captivated - not just for the excitement of the story itself, but for the ideas it presents and the hints it gives of the future of writing itself.  Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore may be every serious reader's fantasy, a novel in which an innocent and unsuspecting person takes a night job at a bookstore where he inhabits the world of ancient manuscripts and ancient typefaces.<br /><br />When Clay Jannon gets hired to work nights in a tiny, but very tall bookstore, he discovers that it is packed with what he calls \\"the Waybacklist\\" of ancient, esoteric books, most of them hand-made. He quickly learns that his few customers always arrive carrying one old book which they want to exchange for a different book from the Waybacklist. When they make the exchange, Clay must record each transaction into an old ledger, including the time, the customer's appearance, his state of mind, how he asks for the book, how he receives it, and whether he is injured.  On slow nights, Clay amuses himself by creating a computerized model of the bookstore in 3D, using a program of \\"data visualization.\\" Identifying each of his customers by a different color in this 3D model, he creates a line for each, and when he begins to see a pattern of overlapping colors, he is stunned, convinced that the customers and Penumbra himself are members of a secret cult.<br /><br />With two computer geek friends, Clay sets out on a quest to learn the carefully kept secrets of the bookstore, using some of Google's cutting edge computer programs and many different kinds of computer languages.  Knowledge of the past, as seen in the \\"Waybacklist\\" in Penumbra's store, in libraries, and in archives around the world may be interpreted in completely new ways, with new insights for the future, when the awe-inspiring magic of computer programming is applied to them, an interesting take on an old theme.<br /><br />The mysteries of the bookstore come to life and keep on coming for the next three hundred engrossing pages, carrying the reader along for a wild ride.  Do not think, however, that this is a \\"wizardy\\" kind of novel with magic and spells - unless you believe that the computer is magic - for this novel is also a kind of homage to the wonders of the computer and the new knowledge it can unlock for those who seek it.  Despite all the seemingly arcane languages, computer or otherwise, however, the true emphasis of the novel is on people, and that is where the book's overwhelming charm lies. The characters are young and enthusiastic, and readers will identify with their search for knowledge and connection, even to the point at which they question the very nature of life and death.  Even more importantly for readers, the author's own ability to see humor as a very real part of existence is refreshing and life-affirming.  Captivating and fun to read, this novel, with all its stimulating detail and its unique twists and turns of plot left me breathless - and smiling.ays, with new insights for the future, when the awe-inspiring magic of computer programming is applied to them, an interesting take on an old theme.<br /><br />The mysteries of the bookstore come to life and keep on coming for the next three hundred engrossing pages, carrying the reader along for a wild ride.

B006BAEQB2|3.0|I've read all of the Cousins' War series books and enjoyed them all. Perhaps I am just getting tired of reading about the same historical events from different perspectives, but this one just didn't grab me like the others. This one concerns the two sisters Anne and Isabel Neville, and the ways their father, the 'kingmaker' Richard Neville, used them as pawns in arranged marriages to further his own causes. Unfortunately there isn't a lot of warmth between the sisters much of the time, and they are apart for a lot of the novel, so the relationship between them (part of what made the Boleyne books work) just doesn't carry this along. In a way, it feels like there isn't an emotional center to this book. It's told from the perspective of Anne, but she just never really connected for me or felt real in the way the best of Gregory's female characters do. But then again, I knew how it would end, and that may have impacted how I responded to her.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is solid Gregory, in terms of the historical detail and new interpretations of Richard III and all that went on in his brief reign. If you have really loved the other Cousins War books you will probably want to read this one to finish it out. If you haven't read any, my recommendation would be [[ASIN:1451602057 The White Queen: A Novel (The Cousins' War)]], which concerns Elizabeth Woodville, who so far has been my favorite of the women in this series, and who gets a different (and quite negative) treatment in this book.
B007PVHBHC|2.0|Judging from the uniformity of 5-star reviews for this album, one can see that the only people who are listening to Patti Smith these days are her acolytes. Just take a look at the reviews for Bob Dylan's and Neil Young's latest offerings and one gets a much wider range of opinions, while still maintaining the reverence that comes with their rock titles. This wouldn't matter if the album in question, Banga, were some phenomenal masterpiece deserving of the fantastic praise, but I just can't see it. After several listens the songs have been unable to lift themselves above merely \\"ok\\" and \\"functional\\". And I still can't wrap my mind around an after-death tribute to Amy Winehouse or a \\"birthday song\\" for Johnny Depp.<br /><br />Lyrically, Smith tends toward a more topical, current-events approach, that, while providing a base for her quasi-Romantic posturings, doesn't really adequately address the topic at hand. An example would be Amerigo, which is not a recounting of the famous explorer's exploits, but in it's romantic evocation of discovery and \\"the new world\\",doesn't necessarily banish the thoughts of racist genocide, either. Same as with the Winehouse tribute or the strange Depp appearance: one is caught between the subject, Patti's interpretation of it, as well as one's own personal reaction, lending to a rather weak result. Patti has always been about self-aggrandizing herself, all the way to Rock Legend, but at what point does she stand bare-boned?<br /><br />Patti Smith has been at it for awhile now, and one can adequately gauge her work from what came prior (and I'm not talking about Horses). No, I would imagine the forerunners to this album would be Peace and Noise, Gung Ho, Trampin', and Twelve. All of these albums were good, even great to a certain degree, but also pretty quickly forgettable--when was the last time anyone but a Smith completist felt the need to return to Memento Mori or even Radio Baghdad? Also, it was said that Trampin' was just as good as Horses, as well (the rallying call for this current album). I even think there was a sticker on the cover with a quote from David Fricke saying as much. I'm not trying to bash such a well-loved institution, but in these days of strife and turmoil, I just think institutions don't go so far in cutting it. Okay, fanboys and girls, you can start marking this review as unhelpful...now!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is very fun. I like how the food has cool and cute faces on them. and even better, he game itself is just fun!! I love it. well worth the money (although I got it as the free app of the day) .... p.s. another game I like is called &quot;coin dozer&quot;
B0054JZC6E|3.0|There are so many different type of games available.Various skill levels. The family had a good time playing. We enjoyed them very much.
B008QE9XD2|2.0|Tim Burton's take on \\"Dark Shadows\\" is absolutely bizarre. There's a straightfaced prologue, some excellent period touches, and some truly atmospheric cinematography. Unfortunately, all of this is put into place to serve a truly poorly-thought out film that can't decide what it wants to be and ends up being one disjointed sequence or sketch after another.<br /><br />Burton's goal seems to have been to create a mashup between \\"Austin Powers\\" and \\"The Addams Family,\\" and to be fair there are a few laughs in this film. (I particularly enjoyed the jokes about Alice Cooper, although Alice's cameo isn't that great). I'd be more forgiving of this take on \\"Dark Shadows\\" if the film were more consistently funny. But it isn't, and maybe the fault lies in the source material itself. \\"Dark Shadows\\" was undeniably campy but it was never self-consciously funny, and introducing outright comedy into the film adaptation just rings false.<br /><br />The shame of it is, the cast would have been fantastic in a straight film adaptation or reboot. Johnny Depp in particular would have been the perfect Barnabas Collins.<br /><br />There are many better horror-comedies out there for you to see. Only Burton and Depp diehards are going to want this one.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a huge Rush fan since I first discovered them at around age eleven in the mid'-'80s, and \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is their best album in thirty years (IMO, of course), and the most consistently heavy of all their albums. The hard rock edge, however, does not come at the price of a dazzling amount of intricacy and overall musicianship reminiscent of Rush efforts of the early days. Apparently, \\"Clockwork\\" is supposed to be a \\"concept album\\" (think the first half of \\"2112\\"), even though I haven't figured out exactly what the story is which would suit such a label. Maybe I've just spent too much time concentrating on the amazing instrumentation, tempo-changes, and Geddy Lee's energetic vocals (powered, as usual, by Neil Peart's lyrics - a refreshing rarity in hard rock) to worry about the collection's overall coherence. If you're a casual Rush fan, or one who (like me) loved their old stuff but gew tired of their releases over the last decade or two, this is the album to get. And if you love the albums of the last twenty years, I'd be shocked if you didn't put this one right up there with - or even above - their more recent albums. In short, but it; you will NOT be disappointed!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Long game absolutely loved it.  Can't wait for the next one to come out I will definitely be playing it
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book. Especially recommended if you remember the 60s and 70s. Fairly light read that will keep you well entertained. Stay away if you are not a gamer or if you dislike scifi.  Enjoy and have fun with with your next game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so awesome and addicting! ! ! you have to get this it is very fun and lifelike just like playing the real thing only free!
B008AS5UAO|4.0|This Don Giovanni boosts of having probably the strongest vocal cast one could expect in the current operatic world; and I am happy to report that at most of the time, the lead roles are wonderfully sung.<br />I own more than a dozen of Don Giovanni recordings - audio and/or visual.  The present performance ranks near the top, but nowhere on the top, alas.<br />The Mahler Chamber Orchestra is a wonderful instrumental ensemble that plays opulently throughout the work, and performs splendidly in the various large vocal ensembles (like the ball-room scene).<br />Generally speaking, but not without reservation, conductor N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin is able to set a very good dramatic pace to the entire piece, and his treatment of the musical balance quite masterful.<br />As I said, the vocal cast is among the current strongest, if you would ask for a Michael Schade instead of Rolando Villazon.  However, even Villazon sings an unusually ardent Don Ottavio here, and is nowhere over-shadowed by other eminent Mozartians like Damrau and D'Arcangelo. Pisaroni and Erdmann have sung their respective roles at the MET HD last year, and their performances as Leporello and Zerlina are true tour de forces. Diana Damrau sings an unusual Donna Anna with her primarily leggiero coloratura. There is nothing wrong with a leggiero Donna Anna if you can depict the drama of the role, which she does admirably.  Apart from Rolando Villazon's surprisingly pleasing Ottavio, Joyce DiDonato's Donna Elvira really tops the splendid cast by her wonderful interpretation of her role.  Her Elvira is urgent, pathetic, upright and noble all in one.  D'Arcangelo, in other recordings a wonderful Leporello, sings a darkly menacing and yet charming Don Giovanni.<br />However, in some major arias, his Don G fails to pull the music off as other great Don Gs did before him - the Champagne aria as well as the Serenade are both watered-down by either inapt tempi or unwarranted rubati. The Serenade Deh Vieni Alla Finestra actually bordered on boring.<br />A similar plight besets the flagging treatment of the Catalogue aria of Leporello, and one is led inevitably to conclude that this is not the singers' problems but the conductor's doing.<br />If you but compare D'Arcangelo's recent (2010) Mozart album under the baton of Noseda, in which those two arias were also recorded, you will see the immediate difference in musical style. With the exception of  Villazon, DiDonato and Damrau, other leading roles are to varying degrees affected in their performances in this recording.<br />A similar `romanticised' treatment besets the recitatives profusely in this performance, though in the recitatives the musical impact is nowhere as great and distracting as in the major arias.  Mozart is Mozart, and an attempt to romanticize Mozart's greatest opera (and probably the greatest opera of all) in an attempt to `better' the score would inevitably subtract from the music instead of enhancing it.lly bordered on boring.<br />A similar plight besets the flagging treatment of the Catalogue aria of Leporello, and one is led inevitably to conclude that this is not the singers' problems but the conductor's doing.<br />If you but compare D'Arcangelo's recent (2010) Mozart album under the baton of Noseda, in which those two arias were also recorded, you will see the immediate difference in musical style.

B0086700CM|4.0|It is a surprisingly addicting game. however,  when you begin to run faster it often lags and makes it difficult to play well.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Finished this in one day.  Wonderful continuation of the story. I can't wait for the last one. Well-written. I couldn't put it down.
B003RS7CT4|5.0|Dexter is a show I have loved for quite some time now.  I actually subscribed to Showtime just for this show...which became quite pricy over in the past few years.  This season is the best television I have ever seen.  The show fell off after this but season 4 is killer, literally.  If you have not already been exposed to spoilers avoid them and you will be quite entertained.
B0087HT36U|4.0|The game is fun although it is much like angry birds. It needs more levels and the transition between one level and the next is far too.long. I would like to play more but the next. Set of levels is not there yet.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great new series!!! From beginning to end, it keeps you enthralled in the story.  Great lead character and a suprising ending.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I totally respect RUSH, and love some of their stuff like HEMISPHERES, FAREWELL TO KINGS, 2112 and FLIGHT BY NIGHT...but, it's been a long time since the last great RUSH album, that maybe is COUNTERPARTS(1993)....Since TEST OR ECHO, i think RUSH is not so inspired anymore, especially Neil Peart's lyrics....they are REALLY dark now....as musicians, Neil, Geddy and Alex are monsters!!!! Can't remenber many bands as techinical as RUSH...but the songs are not inspired...in fact, since SIGNALS(1982), RUSH started to create music with a kind of POP heaviness...i will stick with their legendary classic stuff like CARESS OF STEEL, PERMANENT WAVES and MOVING PICTURES!!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app...it seriously gives you the entire layout of your battery life in a clear display. so useful and it looks lovely.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An excellent sequel to \\"Fall of Giants\\" with some interesting new characters and great follow up on many we met in the first book.  Some of the incidents in the book, putting key characters at key locations like the burning of the Reichstag and the bombing of Pearl Harbor are a bit of a stretch but certainly keep the reader's attention.  I look forward to Book 3!!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I love this show and the zombie DVD holder is awesome. I bought it as a gift for my BF for Christmas, I don't know if I can wait till then to give it to him!
0393330435|5.0|Reading this book back to back with a Steve Jobs, or Apple history book is enlightening.  In some ways you can think of Jobs as representing the Dark side while Wozniak represents the Light side.<br /><br />This book is written as if he was talking to you in his living room.  The editors were lenient and didn't re-arrange the content very much, so on occasion you need to follow him down a twisting road.  But this is good because it makes the feel of the book more conversational.<br /><br />I was really impressed and not bored at all with this biography.  Other reviewers said it was a little technical, and I guess it is, but he explains everything in such a straight forward manner that the average person shouldn't get lot.<br /><br />As a geeky guy myself I really appreciated the technical aspects of the book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of Apple and its co-founders.  I would also recommend this book to anyone who is an engineer or inventor.
B0074AGVWK|5.0|Vintage Maeve Binchy.  I read this on a wet, winter afternoon.  Having been in a similar 'full house' situation until late last year I identified with the main characters who are very believeable. The book is packed full of lots of Irish wit and wisdom.
0525953728|4.0|I give this book 4 stars because I really did enjoy it.  I do wish it was longer but the story is all there.  None of the information in the book seemed like it was serious top secret material or too sensitive for the general public.  This is the type of book that you can easily start and finish rather quickly.  Don't let the fact that it is 300 pages and hardbound fool you.  It is a rather short book.<br /><br />The story provides some background on the requirements and difficulty of becoming a Seal.  The author shares his experiences from previous missions as well as this one major mission that captured so much attention.  He reveals that there was a lot of luck involved with getting to be on this one huge mission and he credits everyone involved including all the support people even down to the men fueling the choppers.  He comes across as very humble and at no time does he boast or take any special personal credit.  I believe his goal is to make sure when you finish the book you understand the importance of every person involved.
B003XU7VY2|2.0|I was not happy with recitation by the author of this book. I would much rather have read it myself. Good content, just not good presentation. Sorry
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have a kindle fire and the pinterest app is amazing on it,  ive never had problems and the pictures look amazing on it.  deffinatly a must have!
0345803485|3.0|I got caught up in the hype and decided to buy this book (even though I have not read a lot of Erotica I thought I'd give it a try).<br /><br />I rarely leave reviews but I thought I should on this one because it left me with mixed views.<br /><br />The cover is beautifully designed and will definitely draw people in but my patience was wearing thin after the author decided to drag out chapter one by over explaining everything.<br /><br />It wasn't until I continued to read on that this was the theme of the book.<br /><br />Over explained feelings, situations and sex scenes, which made me feel like the repetition of certain words (such as, `oh crap', `inner goddess' and `blushes') were just to increase the word count, made me feel that this author wasn't too secure that the storyline would push the book through.<br /><br />Ahhh the storyline.<br /><br />Sexy billionaire who is powerful, confident, built like an Adonis, is educated to a high standard and...he's only 26 and single? Fantastic, however, I was a little curious as to how he maintained his money when all he was doing was having sex and speaking to Ana?<br /><br />The sex scenes were a little unbelievable to me as if my lover made me cum just by saying my name, he would be the richest man in the world as that kind of talent should be bottled and sold.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy this book (even with its confusion on whether the characters were British born living in America as there were lots of British words but the book was set in America? And the constant repetition of words) and I probably will go onto the next book in the trilogy out of curiosity but I can only give it 3 stars because 1 is for the book cover, the next 1 is for learning one or two cheeky things and the last 1 is for the fun of it.<br /><br />You'll either love or hate this book.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I had this video on VHS and watched it at least 20 times... and I had many questions, i.e. \\"how did they do that\\" or \\"wow that was cool.  I ordered video on DVD and there were behind the scenes and making of the film episodes.  Finally, I can have questions answered.  It did not spoil the film, just made me appreciate people behind the scenes more.  I will probably watch it 20 more times and thanks to the \\"behind the scenes, etc., I will enjoy it more.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|You get what you have learned to love with Reacher and Lee Child continues to be a master at describing all.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I started reading this book the day it was released at 745pm ish . . I couldn't put it down it answered alot of questions for the Eva and Gideon.  I have to say I find this book is more rewarding than 50 Shades.  Dont get me wrong I <3ed 50 but this book was more attention to detail with the characters and what they both are going through and went through in the past.  I was up until 2 am and I was still on the HIGH from the ending that I finally feel alseep about 330am. . . I can't wait for book 3 to come out in December.  This is the type of book that I can read it over and over again . . HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ALL !!!  It has love, lust and plenty of sex between these two that I am surpised they are both able to walk . . LOL
B008XG1X18|2.0|I'd have to say 80% of the time it won't log in and will forceclose.  I love this site but am very annoyed with this app.  But when it works it's great!!!!
B005FITIF0|4.0|I ordered Machine Gun Preacher because of a little flyer advertising it that came in the case of the movie \\"Act of Valor\\".  I loved Act of Valor.  Normally I don't watch rated R movies.  However some movies that are rated R, seem more like PG13, such as Act of Valor.  Machine Gun Preacher definitely earns an \\"R\\" rating, mainly for the first part that shows how Sam Childers was before he found Jesus, then for the atrocities in Sudan.  The movie is well done, in my humble opinion, and really should make you think.
B00004YX39|5.0|Lately I have been drinking in remastered Cd's like a pre-menopausal woman absorbing the oh so tawdry 50 Shades of Grey series prior to a hot bath. I am hopelessly hooked on updating my collection and it usually feels so good doing so. \\"Usually\\" is the key word here. Gaucho is a well done remaster as is the entire Steely Dan catalogue.Please see my other reviews for instances IMHO of less than acceptable remasters.<br /><br />Donald Fagan and Walter Becker were perfectionists when it came to their music as any true SD fan is aware. They were probably one of the 1st artists to do a complete remastering revamp of their catalogue. (1999) Gaucho is no exception.Is just me or did this CD leave you wishing for more material??? Way too short<br /><br /> I listen to my music by headphone. As I moved up the scale regarding headphone quality (AKG550's currently) I noticed most of my MP3's sounded really bad. Hence my quest to relive my youth with the best quality sounding music possible.<br /><br />I found that buying ready-made music files was convenient but the quality of files varies - A LOT. Buying remastered CD's allows me to control quality of sound by ripping them lossless......  I could go on and on about what is the best way to rip but there are too many factors to cover in this review.<br /><br />Buying and ripping is actually in most cases more cost effective than buying direct. Anyway, the whole Steely Dan catalogue is well done and no regrets here in purchasing,may be a little bright for some but overall......... sonic brilliance.  Bon appetite my friends
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Another compelling read by Ken Follet.  While the Fall of Giants introduced me to background information about pre-WWI England and Russia, this book covers territory that is more familiar.  Nonetheless, the characters are as engrossing as ever. The coverage of the defining moments of pre-WWII fascism in Europe were all the more interesting taken from a personal standpoint.  A great read for the historical fiction lover.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|From start to finish I was hooked.  Great coming of age book, with surprisingly heaps of humor.  Caught myself laughing on the train several times.  For the price, this is such good value for money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|To say I loved these books is an understatement. A must read! Keeps u coming back for more. Porno on paper.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Very predictable but a nice movie to watch while at home. I liked that I was able to see on line from Amazon instant video for less than the price it would cost to watch on, On demand.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved this book, I could not put it down . Reading this changed some of the ways I think about all products .,after what Apple puts into it we should not accept the sometimes shoddy work of other products . Thankfully we had Steve in this world !
B008LA7RM0|3.0|So, I finally received the newly remstered \\"Pet Sounds\\" CD and I was very disappointed. For the most part, there isn't anything on this CD musically that you don't already have. I was hoping for more clarity on the bass line on the Stereo \\"Caroline No\\" but it actually seems more obscurred. The Stereo \\"Here Today\\" still sounds somewhat whiney on Mike's vocals. I was hoping that they would double track the first two verses of the refrain on \\"God Only Knows\\" as it's so weak but nothing has changed. The mono songs are fine and the same as previous issues. The packaging is sophomoric at best. Thin paper that bends easily, an insert with two of the same photos on it that are already on the cover, the CD does not come inside a protective sleeve and my CD had eight significant scuffs on the playing surface. No words or comments or details about the album or songs. It's obvious that very little thought went into producing these CD Packages. Really a shame. It would be better to download the songs that you may not have and save your money. I love the Beach Boys (...I think even Mike) but everything was as cheaply done as possible (probably to make extra money for Capitol). The counterfeiters will have a field days with these new CDs. They already resemble a counterfeited CD. Sad!  :0(
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved Bared to You and had high expectations from Reflected in You - and my expectations were exceeded.  I laughed, I cried, my heart ached with them.  I could not put it down and finished Reflected in You at 3 am in the morning knowing the alarm would wake me at 6 am for work.  And tonight I have started re-reading it. It's that good.  And now I can't wait for the third book.  But please, please let it be a happy ending for Gideon and Eva in Entwined with You. They so deserve to be happy and loved.
B0086HGW42|4.0|Bought this after watching the iTunes fest. I am a new fan. I think prefer the live show. I would recommend for anyone who enjoys listening to talented musicians.
1423140605|5.0|Like The Lost Hero and Son of Neptune, Mark of Athena uses a 3rd person limited point of view switching between the perspectives of Percy, Annabeth, Piper and Leo. Rick Riordan wisely chose the characters with the most personality. I was really impressed with Annabeth's chapters. It really improved her character and I felt we learned more about her in this book than we did in all the other books combined. I loved seeing the Percy and Annabeth relashionship through her point of view, and it not only help develop Annabeth's character but it even improved upon Percy's as well. The Leo chapters were as strong if not stronger than they were in The Lost Hero and they made me laugh out loud numerous times. We also find out the answer to the whole Leo/Sammy conundrum through his point of view which makes the situation all the more interesting. The Percy chapters are fantastic as always. We still have the brave, goofy and lovable Percy as before. Finally their's Pipers, Piper's chapters aren't bad, they're just not as good as the others. It's mostly just about her love of Jason (who I feel is the weakest character of the 7).<br />The writing of this book is just fantastic. The characters are still amazing. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone (Just be sure to read Lost Hero and Neptune first!)
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Love this movie! Excited that I can watch it anytime and anywhere! Highly recommend this movie. Zachary has sure grown up
B00884GR0W|5.0|worth the money. is well done. note to devs, the new quickslot menu on the far left with 3 slots is bugged for me. a&ntilde;y items left there when I quit are gone when I relog. I'm giving 5 stars anyway because the devs are great on updates and I know this will be fixed soon. (id give 6 stars if they could get the lockboxes I lost back)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The inclusion of so much detail made the book interesting.<br /><br />My one gripe is that the Kindle version can't be shared.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book series. I even reread them. I loved the innocence of Anastasia Steele and the flawed but amazing Christian Grey.  I can not wait to see the film adaptation.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This chilling story of the greed and incompetence of the people who gave us the big meltdown of 2007-8 is highly recommended reading during the current political campaign. Perhaps the saddest observation Michael Lewis makes is that many of the people involved were among the best and brightest in America.  Instead of using their fine educations at Ivy League and other top schools to become doctors, lawyers, scientists, teachers, or statesmen, they have increasingly chosen an occupation that offers little benefit to society, only self-gratification and plutocratic salaries for them and heartache for many others.
B00846REIS|3.0|Enjoyed the book but found it similar to 50 SOG which I enjoyed more. I do plan to read the 2nd book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is so fun! i highly addictive the gameplay is really good and every level is harder<br /> a must have game for people trying to kill time haha
B002RI9S2Y|4.0|This book is awesome. I love it! It's a book you can read again and again without getting bored and when you start reading you can't put the book down. I had to force myself to put the book down when I was reading it. The book is really exciting and you never know what is gonna happen next. It keeps you thinking till the end
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a great game.which it has more coins to start with. I play it a lot.  it passes time off while in a waiting room.
0394800184|5.0|My daughter crawled up onto my lap at least 4 times a day as a little girl to hear me read this book to her. She just had a son (GASP! I'm a grandmother now), and I bought this book to make sure he can enjoy this book and reading as much as she did.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I just love big fish games. I am always on the lookout for the newest one. This one is one of the best that I have played. Very engrossing and doesn't end after only an hour or two. There is some back and forth between the scenes but that is one of the things I like about these games. Makes you think. Keep them coming :-)
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Just finished \\"Reflected in You\\". Gotta say I definitely went into this skeptical. I gave the first book 1 star. I thought it was such a copy cat of fifty shades of grey. And in the first book, it definitely is in a bunch of ways. So I went into the 2nd book thinking it was going to be a repeat of somehow similar to fifty shades darker. But was pleasantly surprised it wasn't. Had its own feel thats separate from FSOG. I still like FSOG more than this series. But I like it now. The second book Gideon and Eva both drove me crazy. I thought they acted like idiots sometimes lol But it was nice to finally get to some truth about gideon and his past. Definitely DARK at some moments. ::spoiler alert:: the molestation stuff & finding out Gideon killed Nathan. Its endearing on one hand that he loves Eva that much that he actually did that for her. Yet kinda creepy. The molestation stuff is creepy too. I literally had to step away from the book some moments and absorb what I had just read. I don't care how hot, rich and good at sex gideon is...still he's pretty much a murderer now. Ugh. But definitely this book is better than the first. Glad I stuck around and gave it more of a chance. Like it had more action this time with sub-plots going on with Cary & everything. A plus is it had more character development. Felt like I got to know Cary more and more. I think he's one of my fav characters in it. He's hilarious & even through all his issues. Like his honesty and how straight forward he is. I thought the 1st book was a bit boring. Kept me more interested this time. I'll buy the 3rd too. I wanna see how they end up eventually in the end. A negative thing...The sex scenes are usual amazing with them. But got on my nerves how more than 2 of them I think Gideon's not even inside her? lol Just getting off kissing or staring. I thought come on step it up! Literally lol Kinda annoying in the first book he says the whole dom/sub thing but they never ever even discuss that again. Itslike why was that sentence even placed in the book if it has no point? Gideon pissed me off a lot in here with how closed off he was. I understand Eva's frustration. She was sharing everything. And he was so closed off and yet expecting her to stick around anyways. Annoying! lol<br /><br />I recommend this to anybody that loved Fifty Shades and if your looking for something else to read in the meantime until E.L. put outs the movie or waiting on a fifty shades 4 lol Than read these crossfire books. I didn't completely absolutely love it like I did fifty. But I still liked it & enjoy it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is very good but needs more blocks and items.  Mojang needs to let the player fly higher in creative mode and put the nether portal in the game. there should be iron door, pressure plates, etc.  I recommend this game who are ok with small amount of items and blocks.  overall this game is a good game for phones.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|SOA is such an excellent show.  It somehow keeps getting better and better.  This season is no exception.  So excited to see how season 5 is going to turn out!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I use it to listen to music from my phone and for car surround speakers when talking on the phone. The person on the other end states they can hear me fine. It maybe a little low but not bad.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never been a reader until now.  I have had time on my hands and read a friends book and then a friend told me about Fifty Shade of Grey and fell in love with Christian and Ana.  Wanted Christian to get the help he needed for his fifty shades and for Ana to find her true love.  I loved the books and can't wait for the next book to be written.
B0012ELMEG|5.0|This is a classic album that deserves to be in your collection.  I agree with others, the booklet is awesome but, the packaging sucks.  It opens like an old record and even has the song lyrics but, this \\"earth-friendly\\" cardboard case scratches the disc if you're not careful.  What is so wrong with jewel cases these day?  It must save them a lot of money.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is an excellant book, fun, sad thru the eyes of a pet, it will make you laugh and cry
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Frankly, Diana Krall's 2012 offering may not be a cup of tea for her standard-minded fans of smooth jazz. Teaming with the inimitable producer T-Bone Burnett, who in the past ten years produced two Album of the Year Grammy winners (\\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\" Soundtrack and Robert Plant/Alison Krauss collabo \\"Raising Sand\\"), they put out a unique album inspired by Americana roots music, blues, folk and Dylanesque approach of verses without choruses (\\"I'm A Little Mixed Up\\"), but still much-based on jazz tunes written in the first half of 20th century.<br />The first half of the record is leaning toward faster songs, sporting Burnett-typical lilting guitars and vibrating, pulsating sounds on top with Krall's now-typical piano, to which you can easily tap your feet. The resulting lush soundscapes are seasoned with a bit of humour in the lyrics, certainly by a woman who knows (\\"There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth the Salt of My Tears\\").<br />Slower tunes need an introspect, reclusive listen, \\"Prairie Lullaby\\" is a highlight among them.<br />Diana Krall's experiment deserves high praise, coming up with a risk which may pay off only later. I have a feeling that only time will fully appreciate this work.<br />To me, she's done it. Again.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Yes , finally Green Day back to basics with an uptempo effort with the old taste of Green Day punk. No political junk (which was okay ) but straight forward old school power punk Green Day. I'm loving Uno and you might too. My fav track, \\" Loss of Control.\\"
0984183523|5.0|If you are planing a career in management consulting then by far this is the best resource to get an insight on the industry, sample logical problem solving techniques, simplified frameworks etc..<br />Take this book seriously and you would gain a lot.. However I am bit skeptical about the amount of discipline outlined in the book.. The book might be daunting at times and might give you an inherent impression that you are not good enough.. However, I would park my skepticism aside and go with Victor coz his plethora of experience in this field.. In short do what he says and you can't go wrong.. Happy reading..
B000I3PERS|5.0|I don't have anything new to bring to Braveheart the move itself,as it is phenomenal. The story line, the characters, the epicness. Its a winner of 5 Academy awards for a reason.<br />THis movie downloaded flawlessly and quickly. the picture was perfect, and never went of focus. Well done Amazon.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the book. could not stop reading it. read the trilogy in 5 days. now I  will read it again.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Serenity is a science fiction story, but it is also not that far-fetched. Besides the point that it takes place in the future, the conflicts are similar to our time.<br />Power, government, control. The civilians vs. domineering people. There are many morals to this tale, and one lesson is that you constantly have to fight for freedom and knowledge. The controlling powers in our world may not have the people's best interest in mind.<br />Alas, the cast is great, and so are the special effects.

B005P5TQPU|5.0|I love Supernatural and have watched it on my Ipad everynight at bedtime. It is funny and scary and the two main characters Sam and Dean Winchester are totally believeable thanks to the great acting of Jared Padlecki and Jensen Ackles. HOWEVER, be warned..AMAZON does not have closed captioning available on this product. If you are hearing impaired DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. Netflix is way cheaper and does provide the subtitles. You can watch some episodes on CW at no cost, but not all of them. I hope this helps. Great show! Check it out and see for yourself!
0316228532|5.0|If more people had approached this book with an open mind, I think it would have gotten better reviews. Despite being told again and again that this book would be nothing like the H.P. books, some people obviously expected something similar. I also think if you understand something about the British sensibility you will like it better too. I've read lots of British authors works and if I had to compare her work to someone else's, I would compare it a bit to Faye Weldon's body of work. In my humble opinion, there is a greater divide between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots\\" in England. Rowling (and Weldon) love skewering the upper classes high opinion of themselves. In The Casual Vacancy, the little town of Pagford wants to cut financial support for a drug clinic in the Fields, which lies between Pagford and Yarvil. Pagford fancies itself the quintessential quaint English village, they don't want the taint of the Fields associated with their town. Of course the fact that a lot of the people in Pagford have roots in the Fields is something they'd all rather forget. Rather than realizing how lucky they were to escape the fate of most Fieldians and trying to help others improve their lot, they want to distance themselves from the people and problems of the Fields. It illustrates how quickly some people can forget where they came from once they get a little money. The biggest exception is Barry Fairbrother, who is from the fields, but lives in Pagford and serves on the town council and is trying to help one girl in particular, Krystal Weedon. Krystal is a perfect example of someone whose life could have gone either way. You get the feeling that if Barry had not passed away, Krystal may have had a chance. You see how easily someone can give up on themselves if no one else believes in them. I don't want to give anything else away but I think her characterizations are just a tiny bit caricatured but otherwise they seem pretty spot on. I hope Rowling writes many more books foradults and I hope she is not influenced by bad reviews to write fluff just to please people who'd rather not have a glimpse at a side of life they'd rather not know exists.
0345535421|5.0|If summarizing the action of the first book was kind of tricky, in the case of the second one it is even more difficult. We'd think that knowing the main characters will make things easier, but the author introduces even more of them and the action itself becomes more and more complex once all the houses of The Seven Kingdoms rise to fight a war in which too many kings claim the same throne.<br /><br />The death of King Robert Baratheon is the event that triggers all the madness. Rumor has it that his heir, Joffrey, is not actually his son, but the result of the incest between Cersei and Jamie Lannister. This is enough for Robert's brothers, Stannis and Renly to claim the Iron Throne. And if this wasn't enough, the North has a king of its own, Robb Stark, who is determined to avenge his father's death, and bring his two sisters back home. Among all this madness, Balon Greyjoy declares himself king of the Iron Islands and attacks the North. With so many kings it's impossible to tell if the war will ever end. Moreover, across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen, the true heiress of the Iron Throne, has the last three dragons. All she needs is an army.<br /><br />A different kind of war is about to unfold beyond the Wall, for the Night's Watch finally decides to form a scouting party and see what the wildlings are planning. When they find out that they intend to form an army under the command of Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall, they realize it will be impossible for them to protect the Wall with so few people. But if it wasn't too difficult to advance in the heart of the wild land, no one knows how they will ever make it back.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings is all action that leaves you breathless. The storytelling is so amazing that the reader is simply drawn into the story and sees the images unfold before his eyes just like a long, addictive movie. Unlike the first book, this has more magic in it. There is a priestess from Asshai who can give birth to shadows and wants to replace the old gods with her own, only god of light and fire. And then, there are the three dragons, which grow bigger every day, making Daenerys dream of the moment when she will be able to ride them.wants to replace the old gods with her own, only god of light and fire.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|I will definitely pay .99 for the full version. love the graphics and the storyline. works great on my fire!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like the different settings that are available and that you can quickly see how much battery power is available for different uses.
B00514HDNW|3.0|Richard Matheson was a fine writer for his time. This was an interesting book but I was continuously jarred by the main character doing stupid things: Putting his life in danger over and over by forgetting real basic stuff that someone with reasonable intelligence would not do in his situation. These plot devices detracted from what was otherwise a thought provoking novel.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Alan Alda and Elen Burstyn did a wonderful job.  Loved how they took the different periods of time and shoed it in B&W.  Beautiful love story.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I would have given this app more than just one star but it wont work!!! It was so awesome and then the update came and it wouldnt work. I thought it was cuz I had to update it so i did but it still says searching when I try to download and wont play anything and i lost all my vids that i already had when i updated it! PLS FIX IT!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is definately a page turner!  The author keeps you engaged and wanting to read more.  The author has an unique way to keep the reader in the character's mindset and is also able to show the character's development through the book.
B00005N5S2|4.0|Even though this is an older movie it shows how determination and sticking to principles can win the day. The product arrived on time and in good condition.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is definately a page turner!  The author keeps you engaged and wanting to read more.  The author has an unique way to keep the reader in the character's mindset and is also able to show the character's development through the book.  I love the development of Christian and how he goes throguh all of the stages to get to the end.  I was happy with the way the triology ended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book it was wonderful it was so exciting i cant wait till the movie for catching fire and mocking jay comes out
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this. It is fun to see what happens as you drop your coins. There are enought objects being dropped to hold your attention . Love the sound effects too.
B0000AOV85|5.0|If you are a fan of the Floyd then this has to be in your collection as well as the companion DVD \\"The Making of Wish You Were Here\\".  Both contain excellent cuts from the discography of both albums, but what really cemented these into my collection was the interviews and behind the scenes material.  They would be worth twice the price to a real Floyd head.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|Paul Newman invariably gives great value for the buck, and this is no exception.<br />But Gloria Swanson excels in detailing in - an event which comes to us all.<br />Namely; being 'a bit over the hill; but reluctant to own it'.<br /><br />We!

Swanson, Newman and the rest of the cast, are just magnificent.<br /><br />  Roy, aged 71.<br /><br />Oops Wasn't Newman was it. Was watching him and Bill Holden in the Towering Inferno.<br />Yep! William Holden. Superb! But then our generation was blessed with the greats.

B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was more difficult to read than Ender's  Game if only because of the several languages Orson Scott Card uses. Very worth the time if you are a lover of Ender.
B007P6VLRS|1.0|It sounds like one of those landscape soundtracks.  I love the pumpkins but this was really bad.  I should have previewed first.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I saw the previews when it was coming to theaters, but never got around to watching it. One night trying to find a good flick out of the norm I decided to watch it and was taken back by the story, graphics, and comedic puns throughout the movie( well timed I might add). I would love to see Disney make the sewuel great family film and great film to brighten imagination
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I found this book to be rather disturbing. I worked with this age group for 25 years. I do not understand why someone did not recognize the need for some counselling for both the young man and his parents. I'm guessing that the author is making a statement on how well parents don't know what is going on in their children's life
044024630X|2.0|I should note up front that I mistakenly purchased the British publication - so the British spellings were annoying, and the photograph of Reacher on the back completely ruined MY vision of what Reacher looks like. It's bad enough that Cruise will be playing Reacher, but now I have two interpretations of what he looks like and it's difficult to get those out of my head.  The editing was not good, either.  One scene in particular - they are eating their peach pie. He gets up to use the phone and notices Devereaux is picking at HIS pie.  He sits back down and they are served their pie. It takes you right out of the story when bloopers like this abound.<br /><br />Also,the military terms were never explained. Fortunately, my husband was a Marine, so I was always asking him to explain what all the military terms meant. Heh, Child - lots of women and non-military types read your books!<br /><br />I don't recall such cold blooded killing in previous Reacher novels, and I've read them all. I finished this one not really liking the guy. And to read that two other people (one the Sheriff) stood by and watched didn't help. What kind of guy brutally kills two guys with his bare hands, while they are not fighting him, then goes back to a hotel and has rabid sex while listening to a train run over the car that the dead guys are in? Not the Reacher I thought I knew.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very spectacular book. I adore this book, definitely one of my new favorites. Wanted to read it before I saw the movie, and I was definitely not a disappointment. :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Excellent reader.  Loads quickly and looks good.  Works every bit as good on my PC as it does on the Kindle reader.  Hey, the price ain't bad either!
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Two words. They're back! Uno is definately a return to Green Day's roots. A fantastic album that reminds me of Nimrod and Insomniac. Question for all those folks comparing this album to Warning. Have you actually listened to Warning lately? I did when I read some of these reviews to see if I was remembering it wrong and sorry if still don't see the similarities. A must have for all us old foggies that started our Green Day fandom in high school with songs like Brainstew Good Riddance and Longveiw. If you're a younger fan expecting this to be like American Idiot or 21st Centuary Breakdown your in for a disappointment though. Still I'm of the opinion that anything Billie Joe does is solid gold! Oh and to the guy complaining about the \\"recent\\" bad language, go back and listen to your old lps and cds. Billie Joe has always had a potty mouth. Can't wait for the next 2 albums!
0312641893|5.0|This book is utterly captivating; the story line and skill of the writer superb. The premise of the book seemed a bit crazy to me at first; the thought of a cyborg cinderella striking me as particularly odd. But after the first few pages all of that prejudice flew out the window and I could hardly stop reading.<br /><br />I noticed a few comments criticizing some obvious foreshadowing.  After reading the book, I think the foreshadowing was quite necessary and actually added to the suspense, since the main character never suspects what we do. I can't imagine the author being anymore successful with execution here; there was simply no other way to go about it without changing an enormous portion of the book, which would be tragic in my opinion.<br /><br />I also appreciated \\"Cinder\\" being what I would call a PG rated book, clean enough I would recommend it to my daughter. Romantic, YES, but not over-sexualized like so many other books attempting to incorporate romantic threads, even for younger age groups.<br /><br />Volume two of this book cannot come soon enough.
B000W91RUG|3.0|It took awhile to get to me and when I got it the snaps that hold the discs in were broken. Otherwise its great!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have released a superb debut album. The fan base for Classical Crossover music continues to expand in the U.S.A. as well as worldwide. I recommend that buyers of this CD check out and support the many other CC artists in this delightful genre, including: Bond, Enya, Celtic Woman, Jackie Evancho, Faryl Smith, Patricia Janeckova, Jonathan & Charlotte, Josh Groban, Haley Westenra, and other fan favorites.
B005QUQP76|1.0|I bought this mouse for playing counter strike, quake, battlefield and mass effect3 and it held up for 1 month month before falling apart. I would never recommend this mouse to anyone. I realize some gaming sites ect. like this POS, but it's built very VERY cheap. The little weights on the bottom constantly pop off and on top of that the mouse freezes. The middle 2 buttons work against any normal gamer because in the heat of battle you accidentally push them constantly. I am going to take this mouse outside and break it with a hammer. Buyer beware!
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Ugh...I don't like to give up on a book once I've started it, and this is one of those books that I had to force myself to finish.  I must say, the best part about this book was closing the back cover--DONE!  The plot crept along at an agonizingly slow pace, and most of the characters were flat and undeveloped. I had such high hopes for this book, and came away utterly dissapointed!
B007MS5B6Q|2.0|No Subtitle for special feature.  I would give it 5 stars if they provide me A SUBTITLE! I want to see web video and delete scenes but there is no subtitle for it.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This app is really fun and I found 1d and ob and cher on it :) It does work on my kindle sceptically you cant use the camera
0316228532|1.0|I have only read the first few chapters of The Casual Vacancy, and I'm printing out the labels to return it to Amazon.  It is awful.  Just awful.  I'd read ahead of time that it isn't a children's book, but I had no idea that meant it would be crude, crass, obscene, and profanity-laced.  And?  It's boring.  Really boring.  I expected so much more from J.K. Rowling, and I'm truly disappointed in this book.
0374275637|4.0|The author built his book upon three distinctions:<br />(1) System 1 ('fast') vs. System 2 ('slow') thinking<br />(2) classical vs. behavioral economics<br />(3) experiencing vs. remembering selves<br />Although I enjoyed the book, I think that it would have more impact if it more clearly targeted either an academic audience or a 'popular' audience. By trying to satisfy both audiences, it may satisfy neither.<br /><br />A popular reader is less interested in descriptive accuracy and testing methodology and more interested in how she can use the theory to better navigate the challenges of modern life. I suspect that the book applying the author's theories to the concerns of the popular reader remains to be written. One question that should be addressed by such a book: \\"Are there powerful institutions that benefit immensely from the System 1 thinking of others, and actually encourage it?\\"  Some candidates: the industrial-military-intelligence complex, the major ancient religions (e.g. Christianity, Judaism, Islam), and the two-party American political system.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|It was a good enough book that I wanted to finish it, but I don't think I'll read it repeatedly.  I read it only while at the gym, and even at the exciting parts I was able to put it away and take it back up the next day when I was on the elliptical again.  That being said, I enjoyed the story and was entertained by it.  I'm not sure it's for everyone, though.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is a very insightful book about the culture and demands of Seal Team Six, and as a member of the military myself, the author preaches to the choir about the issues of politics and bureaucracy in the military. This is a must read for anyone who is interested in learning the REAL account of Bin Laden's killing, or anyone interested in the Spec Ops community.
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|Installed in a decorative cieling fixture this lamp failed after about a week of occasional use (approximately 5 hours).  I did try in another known-good fixture to confirm that it was in fact the lamp.  The return logistics were not difficult and I got a timely refund.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|First, I need to apologize if this review doesn't make sense as I am still detoxing from reading this book.  Secondly, five stars does NOT do this book justice.  This book brought out every emotion in me- turned on, pissed, sad, happy, in love...  it was just the perfect amount of each, keeping me pulled in and addicted from start to finish.  FANTASTIC book, and HIGHLY recommend it.  Job well done Sylvia Day- talented isn't the word for you!!
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|Love, love, love Sex in the City!!!  Great movie and I got it at an unbeatable price.  Very satisfied with my purchase. Thanks!!
B005FPT51K|3.0|The idea behind this is great. It's nice not to have a seperate monitor to pack around. However, it stopped working when the new iOS 6 came out & it took too long to get an update. Finally got that, but now I can't take pics. It says its taken a pic & saved it to my photos, but they are not there. It also closes out other apps that I'm in when the ibaby is running. Gets annoying! It says it will work as long as you're in a wireless network, but that's not true. I have been on many wifi networks & it wouldn't work. So far I have only found one outside of my home that it will work on. The clarity of the picture is very good & it's easy to move the camera around. The camera is very quiet too so moving it around won't disturb your child.
B000P2A3WI|3.0|This book was enjoyable. I was eager to finish and invested in the characters throughout the book. I enjoyed it's setting being in London. It was quirky and made me laugh several times.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Many that read this book before me had told me that the book was great but the ending was lacking. Well I found it to be an awesome ending!!! I would definitely recommend this book!!!
B000I0QL82|4.0|A classic!  Fun story, nice music, great dancing.  Not necessarily a Christmas movie. Holiday Inn incorporates year round major US holidays. A must for Bing Crosby and Fred Astire fans.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Pretty cool game!  I love it!  And it was free.  Definitely worth it and fun!  You won't be sorry you downloaded
B006XF5BTG|5.0|As a man with a job where physical fitness is a pillar in daily life, I find this book to be \\"where it's at\\"! Mike hits all points including proper nutrition, correct form and the importance of adequate rest, while hitting on the subject of dietary supplementation. I'm currently on week 3 and seeing gains at pace I haven't in the past! A must read in my opinion! Bravo Mike!
0812982622|3.0|I haven't completely finished this book yet, but had to write.  It's been very hard to read and I've gotten very angry reading this.  The conditions, brainwashing, lies, cruelty, etc. are mind boggling. You have a picture of communism from stories of Russia, China, Cuba but very little knowledge of North Korea.  Reading this, especially before the Romney-Obama election, is terrifying as we know that this is what Obama would love to see us all become.  One World Government under UN control with \\"fairness\\" to all.  Instead we see privilege to the favored which can change in a heartbeat and immense poverty and suffering for the rest with no hope for a better life.  Our country will slip further and further into this type of system if Obama is re-elected.  May God help us all.
B007FZ7R7W|1.0|A Hot Mess.  Voice and talent do not guarantee class or substance. This is quite evident from this release. This is trash.
B005KCLSUY|4.0|I played the game on my friends xbox years ago and the whole story line concept fascinated me.. So I saw this and read it.. It was really good, great edition to the game, but also a great stand alone novel, full of action and kept me hooked all the way!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If only the preparation and organization described in this book could be extended into the political arena our worries would greatly subside and we wouldn't be looking at a national debt of 16T, ridiculous unemployment, third world credit rating and we might even have a budget to get our house in order. These seals paid the price and won, too bad our pliticians don't understand this.
0345803485|1.0|Why did I buy this book?  Unfortunately, it's a bestseller -- and, it's awful.  Repetition, terrible character development (or lack thereof), and a nonexistent plot.  The \\"erotica\\" is laughable.<br />Well, at least others can gain from my experience.  Hopefully.<br />Don't do it!  You'll regret it!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|It was a good continuation of the first book, Fall of Giants, and I will definitely purchase the next one when it is available.  However, some of the technical data in the book was boring.  I enjoyed the interaction between the characters.  The rest seemed like filler.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Great movie with an excellent High Definition Blu Ray transfer. Great picture quality and outstanding soundtrack. One of the best movies of all times.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. It's not the greatest movie ever made. It's just kinda of silly and light. I don't understand why it was such a box office flop.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|One of the best Mission Impossible movie with awesome stunts and action sequences. Tom Cruise at his best. Great picture quality and outstanding soundtrack.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the crossfire series.. There's not many books that you can come across that has a good storyline and sex.. Sylvia day knows how to pull you and not let you go!.. Even after you finish the book!! Can't wait till December!..
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Using this app to edit photos works well. Not sure if is the phone or the app, but sometimes it won't open the pictures. But still does what it's meant to do.
B002WJI66C|4.0|Boo is an awesome classic Mario enemy, and he makes for an adorable plush! He's pretty small- right around the size of a softball- but as a collector of Mario toys, I don't mind the size considering I don't have a huge amount of space to put all this stuff! It's a bit expensive for the size, but the quality is great. He's very soft and has held together just fine after several play dates with my 3 and 2 year old nephew and niece. If you REALLY love Boo, this one is for you!
034580404X|5.0|One of the best book purchases I have made in a long time. Could not put these books down. Finished all three books and greatly considering rereading them. My husband has also read two of the books and can't put them down either. Great characters, plenty of action, and wonderful storyline that carries through all three books.
0345803493|5.0|Received this book in good condition and at a good price. I love this series. I was hooked! The author did an excellent job with this fantasy storyline
B006BZ8WAI|3.0|Korn was the first hard rock band I ever heard back in 1996 when Follow The Leader came out.  I loved them and to this day consider \\"Issues\\" to be their best album they have ever produced!!  Korn III was an attempt to go to their roots again, which wasn't bad but sounded as bad as Metallica's pathetic attempt with Death Magnetic.  Path of Totality is a decent journey into mixing hard rock with techno/electronica.  It's not bad and I do enjoy two songs from this record, but it seems they are just trying to record new music for their fanbase while attempting to avoid being labeled a sell out band.  I would say they both succeed and don't.  They do because they keep their originality but they don't because this is just an attempt at making a new record with writer's block.  I do own the album but only listen to a few songs from it.  Overall, not an album I'd recommend, but is worth getting a few of the songs.
0425263908|5.0|I didn't know that after reading my Fifty trilogy that I'd like a book anywhere near as close but this book satisfied that addiction. This book was Hott! Great price and fast delivery service. Buy it!
B006TGX27M|4.0|Just when I thought Lacuna Coil had gone soft on me with their previous album, they redeem themselves with this album.  Trip The Darkness is an amazing song.  Lacuna Coil really drove it home with this one, combining smooth melodic tones with a dark atmospheric feel.  It is simply an amazing album!!
0345803507|4.0|I loved the entire series however, the ending was disappointing. It's as if the author was rushing to conclude the story. The first 2 books were so detailed but this one kinda made the ending mediocre.<br />Delivery and value of the merchandise all together was good. Great service
B007VT6QSI|1.0|Now, I may be an avid diehard heavy metal fan, but he has a little talent, but the only song I like is \\"As Long As You Love Me.\\"  Other than that, this album is pointless and just your typical every day teeny bopper crap.  It's like he's trying to put a techno/hip hop spin on Justin Timberlake, which he fails at doing.  Boyfriend is an ok song but too typical for your \\"baby i love you so much, i promise to be your one and only\\" type message that all boy bands sing about.  You're better off just listening to your BSB or Nsync records than buying this entire album.  It's the same crap with the same messages.  There really is nothing original or unique about this album!!
B0058YPL66|5.0|I liked very much the Disney stories, all in one movie...great actors...my wife loved it...We are waiting for the 2nd season...
B001E780W8|1.0|I was introduced to Slipknot back when their self titled album came out, when a friend of mine had me listen to them with him.  I loved them, they had an original and unique sound.  Iowa continued that and actually too them a new level of greatness.  Then Vol. 3 came along and it all went downhill from there.  All Hope Is Gone went even further downhill.  Psychosocial being the only decent song on the album.  I strongly believe they have more so appealed to the mainstream than ever before.  It's as if they feel the need to be more radio friendly and create mere ballads than sticking to their real sound and giving the radio and industry the middle finger.  I don't own the album and never will, I find it a waste of talent and money!!
B004AQR24W|2.0|Big cast. All known and proven actors. But this is really a low budget movie. Shaky cam and cheap effects really do not help. You can see where the plot is going pretty well as the movie progresses. Not really a problem with this kind of movie. IMDB lists this as having an 80 million budget and I think most was spent on actor's salaries. Every one is typecast and that was expected but the cheapness was a real surprise. Shaky cam covers a lot like Dolph's fight scene, close up on his leg as he kicks and cut back to his face. Yeah, ok. That looked real. Would have been better off having him fight older and wiser against a younger person.This style has a tight focus and hides most of the set and just happens to save them a bunch of money. What background you see is quick or out of focus when you see it at all. Popular with some film makers for this reason I think. Looked like a lot of ad libbing but it was good most of the time when it did not seem like actors kidding around on the set. This movie looks like it was made by a bunch of professionals quick and easy with little effort involved.<br /><br />A cheap money maker that filled the expectations but with a cast like this they could have made quite the movie. Mickey Rourke steals the show as he can do at times and was the only bright spot. I really like all the actors in this and makes my disappointment even greater. Streamed on Prime so no cost.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I first heard them on their debut album on the radio and just liked it, didn't love it.  Then I heard Sound of Madness and they caught my attention more. Then this album comes out and it's like, DAMN!!!  They really matured their sound to perfection.  I absolutely love this album, it's a masterpiece and they can only go uphill from here.  This is the kind of album that will make you want to sing along to every track and keep playing this record!!!
B000002GGU|5.0|I was in High School when this Classic was released. Reckless was Adams' 4th studio `album' and without a doubt, the pinnacle of his career!<br />For Adams, the stars lined up perfectly for him on this one. It's one of those rare `albums' people would(should) have on a list they'd want to have if they were ever stranded on a deserted island - seriously!<br />In my humble opinion, Every single track is a bona fide classic hit: All Killer - No Filler!<br />But I can sit here and wax-reckless from one end to the other, but great music = great facts and the facts speak for themselves!<br />Co-produced by Bryan Adams & Bob Clearmountain Reckless was released November 5, 1984. The album peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 and reached high positions in charts worldwide. The album has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide.<br />Six singles were released from the album: \\"Run to You,\\" \\"Somebody,\\" \\"Heaven,\\" \\"Summer of '69,\\" \\"One Night Love Affair,\\" and \\"It's Only Love.\\" All six singles made the top 15 on the US Billboard Hot 100, a feat that at the time had been accomplished previously only by Michael Jackson's Thriller. - How `bout them apples!<br />The album was ranked No. 49 on Kerrang!'s \\"100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums Of All Time\\".  - uh...time-out...Metal? This info. came from wikipedia and just cannot be.  Reckless is about as Heavy Metal as Engelbert Humperdink's greatest Hits...and we all know Humperdinck Rocks!<br />Anyway -<br />It sold over 5 million in the U.S. alone, with only 1 million in his Canadian homeland and the U.K. not far behind at 900,000. No wonder all of the Canadians want to come to the U.S.  Come on neighbors, you produce a lot of brilliant artists - you gotta get behind them!<br /><br />There is such a cool story about the track `Run to You', I couldn't go without mentioning:<br />Reckless' co writer Jim Vallance recalls:<br /><br />In January 1983 producer Bruce Fairbairn asked Bryan Adams and I to write a song for his next production project, \\"Blue Oyster Cult\\". In search of inspiration we listened to the band's past catalogue, including their biggest hit \\"Don't Fear The Reaper\\". The signature sound on \\"Reaper\\" is the arpeggiated guitar riff that opens the song ...<br />Bryan and I spent about an hour creating a riff of our own, initially in the key of A-minor. I still have a recording of Bryan and I passing the guitar cable back and forth (click, buzz, click, buzz), each of us trying a different variation as the riff developed ...<br />Eventually we transposed the riff down to E-minor, later adding a capo to achieve an F#-minor tuning, which better suited Bryan's vocal range.<br />Once the riff was solidified, the rest of the song started to unfold. We spent a few days getting the lyrics and arrangement right, with particular attention paid to the interplay between the bass, drums and the guitar riff.<br /><br />When the song was complete we recorded a demo which we presented to Bruce Fairbairn. He played the song for \\"Blue Oyster Cult\\". We waited to hear the verdict which came a few days later.<br /><br />\\"They don't like the song\\", Bruce said over the phone ... (maybe there wasn't enough cowbell?).<br /><br />Our publisher sent the song to a few more recording artists, including \\"38 Special\\", but everyone declined . \\"Run To You\\" was now officially an orphan!<br /><br />Up to this point Bryan didn't think the song was right for him either. Here's how producer Bob Clearmountain recalls it (from a 2006 interview with Sound-On-Sound magazine):<br /><br />\\"When I first heard 'Run to You' I thought it was pretty good, but Bryan was thinking about leaving it off the album. He was writing songs for other bands at the time, and there was some other band that he was going to give that to. I remember riding around town in his car when I first arrived and he was playing me the demos, and when we got to 'Run to You' he said, 'I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this one,' and I said, 'You're gonna put it on this album! It's a great song.'\\"<br /><br />\\"Reckless\\" was released on November 5, 1984 (Bryan's 25th birthday). \\"Run To You\\" was the first single from the album. Decades later the song continues to be an Adams concert favourite, and it still enjoys significant radio airplay around the world.<br />\\"Run to You\\" was released as the debut single from Reckless on October 18, 1984 in Canada and the U.S. and became one of the most successful songs from the album on the American rock charts; it would become arguably one of Adams' most recognizable and popular songs. The song reached the top ten on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and was Adams' first number one hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and number six on the Billboard Hot 100. It reached the top 20 on the Canadian singles chart and remained in the top 20 for seven weeks. With \\"Run to You\\", Adams reached the highest Canadian chart position in his career to that time; it was his second top 20 hit single in Canada. \\"Run to You\\" was released in November 1984 in Europe where it peaked at the top ten in Ireland at number 8 and reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart; it was his second single to chart in Europe<br />Go Figure -<br />I know there's no one on the planet that hasn't heard or isn't familiar with this 5+ star classic, and so I guess this review and more general information than a review for someone looking to `check this one out'... I mean, there's no honest opinion of Reckless that could come close to anything less than a 5+ star rating, but I guess there's always those who simply may not get it for whatever reason and I guess that would be their loss.
B005IS565S|5.0|FFDP is the band that makes patience well worth any waiting period.  My ex wife's ex boyfriend turned me on to FFDP, and I have loved them ever since.  Getting heavier and more aggressive with each album, this one is not a waste of a single penny of your hard earned money.  I absolutely love this album and listen to it a lot.  I have been a huge fan of Ivan Moody since his Motograter days, and am very pleased with his work in this band.  He was meant to be a part of FFDP, and it is very evident in all three of their albums.  This is a must have in every metal fans collection!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I do not enjoy reading, but everyone kept telling me how good it was an that I had to read it, so I downloaded it on my kindle. I read it in just two days. I couldn't put it down. It's a must read!!!!
B0050PLT8W|4.0|I have love TOAD since the start and they get better and better with each album.  The only song I can say I don't like is \\"Love is Hell\\" simply because the song really has no direction or anchor and is to slow for it's nature.  Other than that, I love this album.  Yeah they have gone redneck rock, but they do a good job of keeping their core sound that makes them who they are.  They only difference between this album and the previous ones is they are a lot more ballsy on this one.  Taking their music and lyrics in a new direction and showing a bit of a bad ass element of them.  I think the sky is the limit for TOAD and I'm very impressed by this album!!
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I have enjoyed other skip hop products but this does not seem to keep the wipes moist they dry out. I got this holder for my car in case of a quick diaper change and was dissapointent more than once. If it did not have the easy red slide tab I would have had moist wipes.
B0082LUEW8|3.0|I love Mudvayne, Hellyeah and Pantera, but unfortunately not this album.  I listened to most of it and was not impressed.  Stampede was great but this one fell through the cracks somewhere.  I love thrash metal, but this is poorly distorted, monotone thrash.  Chad has excellent vocals which is why I gave it three stars.  I have always been a fan of Chad but this album is not that great.  It's as if they were trying to mimic Pantera too much and try to keep a Hellyeah original sound.  I absolutely love Pantera, and respect in the highest degree, but Hellyeah should not try to hit those standards, they need to stay true to their sound and not mimic a legendary band.  Of all people, I would think Vinnie would understand this, and Chad wanting a tribute to Dimebag and Pantera, should know you can't mirror Pantera even though I love his thoughtful nature.
B007IE4DT0|1.0|I bought a 180g vinyl and... Well, so many great songs in a very poor quality vinyl. Lots of sshhsshsh when you should listen just the music. Like George once said ISN'T A PITTY?<br />The relaunch of McCartney catalogue has the same problem. They are Gods. And deserve better. I won't buy anymore.
B003XRZZFM|5.0|Despite the fact I love their skull crushing metal riffs that are found in \\"In Sorte Diaboli\\" I do happen to love this album.  It's a lot more symphonic than normal and not quite as heavy as normal, but in a way, it almost makes it better.  Shagrath's vocals are really improved as he does a combo of talking and screaming.  It still retains the normal very dark and sinister feel to their sound.  \\"Gateways\\" \\"Dimmu Borgir\\" and \\"Endings and Continuations\\" are my favorite tracks.  They have been my all time favorite band for 12 years and they still continue to blow my mind with every album they make!!
0525953728|5.0|I read this book on a 5 hour flight from Los Angeles to New York. I never put the book down the entire time. Even as we were landing, I have to admit that I snuck a peek of the final pages on my ipad.  All I can say is thank God for Mark Owen and others like him who put their lives on the line to make the world a safer place.
B008C1O8CA|1.0|Maybe I just like the intense in-your-face music but this is not typical Green Day.  This is some pop/teeny bopper crap that I couldn't bare to listen to.  The ONLY good song is \\"Let Yourself Go\\" because of the aggressive nature.  But I'm not wasting my time or money on this garbage.  American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown were flawless and I was so excited when I heard they had something new coming out.  I was majorly disappointed by this album, \\"Oh Love\\" was a crap ass waste of time song, and I don't know what Green Day is thinking with this stuff, it's nothing worthy of real music fans.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like that I can use the app where ever i am and still access pinterest makes. it easy to keep up with. things. while I am away from the computer.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I first knew Nickelback when their \\"Silver Side Up\\" CD got radio play.  I have been a fan ever since.  There are some albums I'm not fond of and thought they were heading downhill with a few of their albums.  But Dark Horse redeemed them and this one continues the redemption.  Lullaby and When We Stand Together are my two favorite songs.  I don't know why people hate Nickeblack so much, but I love them.  They have a unique sound and can captivate an audience easily.  I would love to see them in concert but will continue to love their music.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Watched the movie first, then decided to read the books.  loved both the book and the movie! great read cant wait to start the next in the series!!!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is an unforgiving album that is quite aggressive and to the blunt and honest point.  \\"Cold Wind Blows\\" is one of my favorite tracks because of the very irreverent humor and flow of the lyrics.  Beyond extremely vulgar but very beautifully put together.  This album is hands down, most definitely Eminem's best record to date.  I find myself listening to this one often and love it.  \\"On Fire\\" however is a boring and dull track and find myself skipping every time.  Eminem is coming out with another album soon but I don't know if he can one-up himself from this record but we will find out.  This is one of mainstream hip hops best albums in the last ten years easily!!
B00992CF6W|1.0|will nnot let me download this is why i give it bad review it will refuse to let me download this i dont know what is going on.....
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Oh my god!!!  I have been a huge fan of Nightwish since hearing their hit \\"End of all Hope\\" and never loved them any less!!  This album is good from start to finish and is very addicting.  Despite the fact I'm sad they fired Taraj, Annette has a great vocal addition.  Though I didn't care for her on \\"Dark Passion Play\\" she makes up for it with this album.  This is where her voice fits nicely.  \\"Storytime\\" is a brilliant song and \\"Imaginaerum\\" just captivates you and loses you in the moment.  That's exactly how this genre should make you feel if done right.  Melodic Goth Metal at its finest and will be nearly impossible for any band to one-up!!
0871137380|5.0|This was a truly amazing book. I read a lot and it is probably the best book I have read this year. I have always heard of it but, never read it until now. Highly recommend reading.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|Lamb of God produces one of their most powerful and aggressive albums ever.  This is a punch in the face with a heavy duty aggressive nature and a finger to people who can't handle metal.  Lamb of God is one of those bands that breaks metal and sound barriers constantly and they know they have no limits and no boundaries as to what they can do and love to unforgiving!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG!  I read 50 Shades of Grey 4x and as much as i loved that trilogy, this is just as exciting!  I was worried at 1st  about how similar it was said to be to 50, but other than some wording in the first book, this story holds it's own.  I love Gideon and Eva and can't wait for December 31st to ring in the new year with the next book!  i hope it comes out sooner though!  I will be rereading this book many times too!
B001FEA9QU|1.0|The only good Metallica is anything up to The Black Album.  After that, they completely sold out.  Death Magnetic was their attempt (key word being 'attempt') at bringing old with new and mixing them.  It was a disaster as evident on this album.  I have heard a few songs and couldn't handle listening to any more of it.  This is a disgrace to metal, especially a band considered to be the greatest metal band of our modern day and damn near of all time.  I would not recommend wasting even one single penny on this garbage.  They fail miserably with this record, and they wasted their money producing it.  They need to call it quits, they have had their time, they should retire and enjoy life.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The west wing was without a doubt the best written television series of all time. The acting, pacing,drama and comedy are sensational at the minimum. I never tire of watching this. They really deserved all the emmys they got and the series took a decided turn to the downside when the writing changed after the fifth year i think. Still i cherish  what i can watch and know the likes of this will probably never be seen again. This is great fun to watch if you have a brain and sense of humor. Highly recommended.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|They have proven yet again how damn good they are!!  This album is great from start to finish and leaves you wanting more.  Luckily Amarylis delivers more but Sound of Madness leaves you craving more Shinedown.  Just truly a fantastic album and a wonderful direction they went in.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The raw emotion, the drama, the suspense, and of course the excellent sex make this a definite must read. Fifty shades of grey has NOTHING on these book's!!!
B005LAII12|5.0|My wife and I saw this in theaters and laughed the whole way through.  Vulgar and irreverent humor isn't appreciated by many people, but you have to have an acquired taste for this to appreciate it.  I loved how Seth Mcfarlene puts this movie together and makes such quirky humor as a beautiful thing.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy adult-oriented humor and pervasive language.  Definitely a movie worth owning and watching once in a while!!
B006VGGAC4|5.0|For the people that rate this book as one star and haven't read it and bash something they haven't read, give it a break! and get a life. This is a customer review section for people that read the book! Thank you I will be buying this to form my own opinion after READING the book.
0525953728|4.0|This book contains an in depth look at the tactics used in the raid. For people looking for information on DEVGRU, you wont find it in this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read the trilogy twice now and I love it! It's a story I want to go on and on and on. Well-written and entertaining. It takes me away from my day and into another world where Good prevails in the end. It's kind of billed as a \\"teen\\" story, but I love it.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|This movie was great to watch and see areas in Europe that we had been to in the past, as well as following the mystery the two stars were trying to solve.
B0094K1PW4|3.0|Great combo of danger, shoot 'em up, explosion and... heart. Perfect Abrams/Speilburg combo. The playback was rough toward the end.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|A long time ago (when I had the 1st gen iPhone), I bought my first Apple-specific BlueTooth transmitter. Back then, it was a godsend, being able to send music to my S9s sans wires and being the envy of the gym. Fast forward to now and I have the 6th Gen Nano. As is known, this model (just like the previous ones) lack BT. Fortuitously, I found my dongle (after moving several times, my original was \\"misplaced\\"). Plugging it in, I was happy that it still worked. Sort of. And when I mean \\"sort of\\", I mean SORT OF. It would cut out and get choppy, as if it was having issues connecting to my S10HDs. That's where this came in. While pondering if I should get a new Nano or just update my transmitter, I opted to try the path of least financial obligation first. Let me tell you...the difference is night and day.<br /><br />Range: While my old transmitter had issues keeping the connection with my S10HDs, this one keeps the stream alive with no problems. I've been able to put my nano in our group workout room and leave, walking around the gym getting weights and whatnot for my supersets and the stream is right there. Range is about 30-ish feet, just for reference. Don't try going between floors, though. That's where she falters.<br /><br />Pairing: Was absolutely flawless. Let me point out here that the user needs to understand HOW to pair their device (most likely a BT Headset or the Belkin BT stereo adapter). It's not the vendor's fault that you can't figure out how to pair your headset. That being said, you need to make sure your device enters pairing mode (usually by pressing and holding the power button until you hear your device's \\"Pairing Mode\\"-specific tones). My protocol is to attach to my Nano, make sure it's paused, turn on my S10HDs to pairing and wait about 10 seconds. It usually picks up well within that time.<br /><br />Size: It's tiny. Like, TIIIIIIINY. (that's what she said). Find a film canister (yes, they still make those) and keep it in there. Or a zippered pouch. Or something. I don't suggest keeping your nano plugged in to it as it will drain the battery really quickly. Speaking of which...<br /><br />Battery: It is 100% true that your Nano will pretty much die in 2 hours, TOPS, when you're using this non-stop. However...that's due to the low battery capacity of the Nano, NOT the fault of the device. It's not going to be a problem if you're among those who charge your device regularly or if you use your Nano solely at the gym. My 4 year old iPod Classic (yes, be jealous)  can juice out almost 5 hours of non-stop streaming via BT. Totally worth it.<br /><br />Other observations: When you attach this dongle to your iDevice, keep in mind that it does stick out. That said, take care not to hit it by accident as you might damage the dongle and possibly the port on said iDevice. Trust me.<br /><br />In closing, If you don't want to have to buy a new iPod Nano because yours are perfectly acceptable  (sans BT, of course), this would be a great addition to your current setup. It's easy to use, minuscule in size, and absolutely worth it.pouch. Or something. I don't suggest keeping your nano plugged in to it as it will drain the battery really quickly.

B008H6GH8I|4.0|I just finished watching RED and it's better than any of those grabage RE movies made by Paul \\"What Script?\\" Anderson. The story moves quick, has plenty of action, some nice Horror scene's and actually feels like part of the RE universe. It's a shame that we couldn't get some quality live action movies from this team but the next best thing would be if the people behind RED could make an animated movie set during the events of the first three games in Raccoon City. I'd KILL to see that.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is most definitely similar to the versions I played at carnivals when I was a kid - addicting and hypnotic.  The goal is to push as many coins as you can forward off the table (rather than off the sides).  You gain prizes and levels as you go along, and they each give you certain benefits, special coins, etc.<br /><br />For me, the game has felt like two different games:  before and after.  The before portion had me desperately wanting to get more coins, even trying to fight the temptation to buy some coins.  The after version (after I've gotten lots of rewards and levels) has had me getting more coins than I know what to do with - it's almost a bit too easy at this point, but still an entertaining way to pass some down time.  A definite winner (though a major time sink!)
1451662432|5.0|Arnold came here, worked hard, and achieved his dreams! What an amazingly inspirational story! I couldn't put the book down, don't listen to the 1 star reviews! They are just Arnold haters and most of them didn't even read his story. Probably just liberals who don't believe that EVERYONE has a fair chance, even immigrants who don't know a soul!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Yes. Yes it is. Block story may be less expensive. But for some reason I can't explain....I'd have to say Minecraft is better.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book is kind of just a dark, violent mope-a-thon.  It seems rushed and poorly planned.  The story seems to go on and on without progressing.  This book doesn't give the reader the same satisfaction every ten pages or so that I got out of the previous two books. That said, it is nice to see how the story ends, so I would never discourage somebody from reading the book.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|This CD is great!  It has just the right mix of relaxing instrumentals and high energy music.  If you saw the movie, you'll want this CD!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|This was a nice source with which to get a feel for what actually happened that day, and get the human side of how real special ops can go.  That said, the author jumps around quite a bit, which might be useful in a movie script, but he didn't quite have the writing chops to make it work well in print.  He paints a quick, factual picture, and I'd definitely recommend reading it, just don't expect it to keep you up all night, unable to put it down.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Okay, I enjoyed this book but was frustrated with the lack of conviction about ... anything ... on Katniss's part. She seemed so withdrawn throughout the novel, and while I can understand she was in pain, I would have preferred more resolve and some effort for her to be better on her own without everyone pushing her all the time.<br /><br />I was really getting frustrated toward the end at how lenient she seemed to have gotten, but felt a little more redeemed than I thought I would by the events. What I had hoped would happen, finally happened and the story wrapped up nicely and believably, after an eternally long time, once again, in depression and misery.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the series but had hoped Katniss would pull out a bit more of her own conviction and strength.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0093HDV20 inDIVISIBLE]]
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I can't begin to express the overall fun I had watching this film. I would go so far as to say it's my favorite Tom Cruise flick (followed by \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" and \\"The Last Samurai\\"). It was certainly leaps and bounds over the three previous MI films in terms of action sequences and the overall \\"fun\\" factor. The supporting cast gels incredibly well and the addition of Jeremy Renner to the team just adds to that ensemble dynamic.<br /><br />Brad Bird gets a HUGE thumbs up here for his first foray into the live action realm. I've been a big fan of his work (Iron Giant, The Incredibles) and I knew he had great pacing skills...but he's also great at character interaction and dynamics. It's Cruise's movie...but each character in it shines every bit as much as the leading man. Brad Bird is likely responsible for that. The previous films came off as Tom Cruise action vehicles...but Ghost Protocol really is an ensemble piece and plays a lot like \\"The Avengers\\". As a matter of fact, I enjoyed this one just as much as \\"The Avengers\\" and, in some aspects, maybe a bit more.<br /><br />If you're an action/stunt afficionado, this is a must see!! The Dubai tower and Mumbai parking garage sequences stand as some of the finest, if not THE finest, action/stunt sequences it's ever been my pleasure to watch. My only regret is that I didn't have enough foresight to go to a theater to see this in it's initial theatrical run.<br /><br />The bottom line...<br /><br />EASILY the most fun I've had watching a film this year.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy was scary in that I can see some of the same things happening again in THIS century. Ken Follet got the points across without being didactic or preachy or using scare tactics, however. It is just amazing how similar things have turned out to be in this day and time.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Bollywood meets Merchant Ivory in this reasonably pleasant film which, perhaps, is more successful as a travelogue of modern day India as opposed to an intense dramatic experience. It revolves around many quirky and eccentric characters with the intent of providing some moral uplift and inspirational feel. Political correctness abounds. Yet, I have no trouble recommending it as a rental for a quiet evening at home.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Has some very good scenes, and the plot pacing is quick enough to hold your interest.  Not much more to it than a good yarn.  Certainly not wonderful, for me.  Am not interested in reading any more.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Why 5 stars?<br />To counter some of the negative critiques this book does not deserve. I am a reader with a substantial personal library. Nothing gives me more pleasure than quiet times in the evening with a good book and this one does not disappoint.  This novel has a plethora of characters whose lives intertwine and JK tells the story with matter-of-fact frankness laced with profound truths in regards to Human Behavior! She is an adept observer of human nature which is what makes this book a delicious read. Get over Harry Potter Folks...Ms. Rowling has and she has moved on displaying yet again her God given literary talents!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|I enjoyed the first book and found this an equal to Fall of Giants it is such a pity the wait was so long as I had to do a review to catch up on the characters<br />Ken Follett can draw amazing pictures in your mind Winter of the World does this so well I felt I was there watching and listening seeing two sides to each conflict each emotion .. I look forward to the final book in this trilogy
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all three of the Hunger Games books I purchased from Amazon for my Kindle including Mockingjay. I restricted myself to reading only when I was riding the stationary bike. I racked up the miles quickly as I couldn't wait to  read what happened next.
B000FC1QQU|4.0|Once again I have enjoyed another book in the series \\"The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  I have read several of these books, not necessarily in order, and I will continue to read them.  Alexander McCall Smith has a nice way of describing life in Africa and I like reading about successful women. I am going to order and read the new series that he has written.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Well, Sylvia Day has done it again for me. She has given yet another 5++ STAR book that leaves me aching for more. I don't miss the sleep I lost to read this one into the wee hours of the morning, it was so worth it.<br /><br />Ahhhh, Gideon and Eva. You remain to be one of my top favorite book couples. You are so hot, yet so cold. Gideon is SOOOO alpha-male, he's obsession with Eva is almost too much to handle. I loved Gideon in \\"Bared to You\\", but during much of \\"Reflected in You\\" he frustrated me to no end...you'll see. The last 25% of the book is almost more than your heart can take. You're angry with Gideon, but wanting to trust him. Angry with Eva, but wanting to hug her and tell her 'everything will be okay'. Sylvia has done a wonderful job of allowing us to get to know these characters at a very deep level.<br /><br />To say that I am sitting on the edge of my seat, gnawing at my fingernails and waiting for book 3 would be an understatement. :)
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|it is fun but it isn't as great as they advertise. it is still fun and it is probably my tenth favorite game
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have been looking forward to this book in so many ways.  I like this series so much better then the 50 Shades series.  At times I hated Anna.  In this book their was times I wanted to shake Eva, and I was glad that she got ahold of herself and saw her own destructive patterns.<br /><br />It is a beautifully written book.  The descriptions are brilliant and there was definitely more character growth and development.  I was totally sucked into the story, so much so that I started it at 7:30 and finished late last night.<br /><br />To be honest  at times I hated both characters.  He was an ass and at times even scary and she found herself right where she did not want to be, repeating destructive behaviors of her past.  But I thought that the author gave her the opportunity to redeem herself.  It was odd how  the author played it all out.  It seems an extreme form of true love.<br /><br />I do understand the behaviors of the characters completely.  Being a victim of abuse myself, I can see myself in Eva, totally.<br /><br />There is still so much more to deal with and I am looking forward to the rest of their story.  i hope that Gideon can continue to move forward with Eva in a positive manner and build a lasting, loving relationship.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Every 5th consecutive day you're supposed to get free flu credits, but it doesn't save them so you can use them at all. Great game otherwise.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game makes me feel like I'm hangin' out in the arcade again(plus great graphics!)! Cool fun for all ages.
B005LLSNNE|3.0|The videos were easy to access.  A few of the episodes seemed like when the dvd is scratched.  I didn't miss huge parts of the show, but it was irritating.

0345803485|1.0|I was pressed into reading this by a friend who thought the trilogy was a great read (her first erotica was the attraction) ... I had been initially put off by the whole aspect of BDSM & the hilarious edict by big boy reviewers, ie. LA Times, as \\"Mommy Porn\\". For the sake of my friend's enthusiam, I plowed in ... ah, perservered when the going got tough. Oh yeah, metaphors are awkward with this one.<br /><br />The whole submissive vs. dominant relationship felt stilted and too much of the plot seemed artificially coerced as another excuse for a heated sexual event. And the heat of those cooled quickly in impact as the story wore on. I found it difficult, [snort] okay, near impossible to set credulity aside. Although I must admit this erotic book actually has a PLOT when so few do, there's a little too much \\"blushing\\", \\"lip-biting\\", \\"gasping\\" and \\"eye-rolling\\" for my patience. Anastasia is an incredibly childish nitwit at the mercy of her overheated hormones. Christian can't make up his mind what he is which I didn't find likeable or sympathetic in spite of the chronic drumbeat about his \\"smoking good looks\\". Worse than a soap opera. In short, there will be no titillating gray tie as a holiday gift for my DH unlike the syncophant fan rush last December. I will not be reading the remaining two books as I found the main characters exasperating and the interesting peripherial characters too understated. The one evident pain for a thinking reader was the waste of potential. This plot might have developed more clearly with character depth including some expansive research into why anyone would prefer BDSM.  Seriously, I would liked to have seen some inkling of WHY pain would work in this or any relationship but that was completely left unrequited.<br /><br />In commenting back to my friend I attempted diplomacy since she liked the books, but we've definitely known each other for enough years that she busted up laughing at my strangled effort to hedge and be kind. Directness is one of my compulsions, delight in a well-written book is another. The ultimate confession: I ached to slap this irritating author until I felt better. My friend's joking response was the possibility of my ever being a Submissive was never happening. Really, ya think?! Point here is if you have a few decades of adult experience this book is quickly tiresome despite the checklist of sexual variance from vanilla to chocolate whatever.<br /><br />Finally, my good friend did fess up that she found the second book too intense on the whole BDSM thing while the story marked time before shackling together the dangled subplots in the third book. No surprise there as this whole trilogy trend is another nuisance ... I far more relish a stand-alone book that tidies up a story line without the manipulative tweak to relieve curiousity with another purchase. And another. I won't play that game.
0316228532|5.0|Rowling's \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is, in some way, indeed aimed at her prior audience. The children that grew up with Harry and company are now in their early twenties, the demographic which this reviewer believes will have the most interest in this work.<br /><br />Rowling maintains her direct writing style, eschewing flowery language for precision that can hit just the right humorous note or strike like an angry arrow. Brought to the world of adult literature, it gives a very clear, no-nonsense view of reality, as she explores humanity's darkest corners. From the confusion of puberty to the dark, pit-like trap that is drug addiction, Rowling brings all to light without bias or judgment, but rather allows almost every character to appear both sympathetic and yet terribly, terribly flawed.<br /><br />For this story has no heroes. This is not a venture in the battles of good and evil or black and white, this is simply an exploration into the grey and greyer world of the mundane. There is precious little plot to speak of, and it moves along at a snail's pace - it exists only as the character actions drive it themselves, and it is the characters that this novel highlights.<br /><br />Some are turned away by the novel's harsh language, explicit sexuality, or views into the lifestyles of \\"the depraved\\" (to quote another reviewer). However, the reality of our world is that children come up with new, colorful ways to curse at each other each day. What adults refuse to teach them about their bodies, they are more than happy to learn for themselves. And whether you pity them, fear them, love them, or despise them, the kinds of people you don't want to associate with will always exist, somewhere around the corner or across town. For bringing these things to light in a light that does not judge, but rather illuminates and offers respect, Rowling deserves every accolade.<br /><br />Her greatest achievement may be in her parallels of childhood and adulthood. As the petty (and at times, not-so-petty) conflicts of childhood play out, they are mirrored by the equally frivolous battles of adulthood - and yet, to the characters, each event seems to mean everything in the world. This is because, when one is inside their own novel, everything -does- matter, with unwavering importance, even if in the long term, it's a tiny flash in the pan.<br /><br />Rowling drags the human condition into the light. At times it laughs uproariously, at times it is reduced to kicking and screaming, but it is constantly compelling and accurate. While the subject matter evokes the classics, the style is gorgeously and unabashedly her own. It can, at times, drag as one finds favorites in some subplots and less interest in others, but all are sufficiently intriguing to maintain interest, and rewarding in the end.<br /><br />However, this book should come with a disclaimer: This is not for those offended by reality, or for those who fear the taboo. This is not for people who are afraid to recognize their own flaws in a book, who cannot withstand true self-reflection. \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is for the adventurous, the open, the kind of people willing to view plainly the nature of reality before them, and are prepared to change it.mes, not-so-petty) conflicts of childhood play out, they are mirrored by the equally frivolous battles of adulthood - and yet, to the characters, each event seems to mean everything in the world.

B0011UF79C|5.0|As a collector of great movies this is one to have.  The furture might bring great thing or it might have unexpected unguaranteed success that one is not able to control.  This movie just makes a person viewing the movie think about their life, moments, and successful motives.<br /><br />This is another great movie one can help to believe in one's self.

B006AN78XS|3.0|It was an \\"okay\\" watch. Needed something while on a 4 hour plane ride. It kept me busy - that's all.
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|I seen this movie years ago when it first came out.  I am a fan of Sharon Stone because she know how to protray a character well.  This movie is really great because of what is going on is the world today.  I will not tell the story but watch it and you will be amazed of what happens.<br /><br />Two great actors Sharon Stone and Willaim Baldwin make the movie a collectors item.[[ASIN:B000EQ5SRK Sliver (Unrated Edition)]]
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Wow! This is an incredible documentary. After watching it I realized how little I actually knew about Bob Marley. I wish I could have seen him just once in my life, but I was too young. I have seen Ziggy Marley in concert. But, Bob changed the world and made it a better place. It's not quite the same without him around.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it seems weird but it is not it is awesome get it it is free and amazing just get it listen to be
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I find the game as a great way to pass the time. Lots of fun things to do and a neat twist onnannold favorite.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I cannot believe how much I cheer for this couple. They have overcome so much, with more to come I am sure. I couldn't wait for this to come out and then I tried to keep it on the iPad until the weekend but I had to start reading and read until I couldn't stay awake only to wake up 4 hours later and not being able to sleep until I finished it. I hope so much for them that they can find the peace they so deserve in the final instalment. I didn't think anything could compare to Shades of Grey but this is so very close. I can't wait for December for Entwined with You. Thank you Sylvia Day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this trilogy.  Kept me reading and wanting more.  Would like to see this continued by E L James with more family saga as the Grey children begin their adult years.
B005FISBTO|1.0|This was a great season of Dexter. However, as other reviews have stated, this product ruins the cliffhanger by having the final scene shown every time you start EVERY disc. This Showtime preview is probably 3 minutes long. I have contacted Showtime and was told:<br /><br />Thank you for reaching out to us.<br /><br />Paramount Home Entertainment is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of our Original Series DVDs and we are working together to remove that preview from future prints of the \\"Dexter\\" Season Six DVD.<br /><br />For more information, please contact Paramount Home Entertainmet at phe_customerservice@paramount.com<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Showtime Customer Service<br /><br />Maybe it will be fixed, maybe not.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This was a great documentary, especially for people who love food.  It was heartwarming and very interesting.  This truly shows great sushi that most people in the US do not know about!  Makes you want to go to Japan!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved Reflected in you even better than Bared to you. I couldn't put it down, it was like an addiction. I'm not going to compare these books to Fifty Shades like other people have done, to me they're two great series with their own merit. I have to say that I love the writing, the attention to detail and the development of all characters, not only the two main ones. Fantastic job Miss Day!
0805095535|5.0|Paul Auster started out writing as a poet. And this autobiographical volume has a poetic quality about it. It is a work of great intelligence and originality. He tells his life story by telling  the story of his bodily life. He also tells it in summary in what is perhaps the real center of the book by describing the places in which he has lived. In describing all the places he describes who he was at the time and what his relationships were. He gives attention to aspects of our experience, especially in for instance listing all the various kinds of activities his hands have engaged in which I suspect most of us do not ordinarily think of. He also tells two family chronicles, one of his own problematic, fragmented Jewish family and the other of his wife's Norwegian American more harmonious family. He also writes at length about what is clearly , aside from his writing perhaps, the most meaningful thing that has happened to him his more than thirty - year relationship his marriage to the writer Siri Hustvedt. After a series of failed relationships including a first marriage which did have nonetheless the gift of Auster's oldest child ,  Auster found in Hustvedt his true soul- mate, the one who he shares his world with. His love for her pervades the book. He allows himself to speak of their relationship perhaps because she too is a public figure. He does not however speak about his children, his feelings toward them. They must be protected. Auster also speaks on occasion of his Jewish background, primarily when he is attacked for it. He is not ashamed of his Jewishness but he does not seem to have any knowledge of its historical or religious meaning , or any real interest in it. He also in the work does not write at length about what is central to his life, his writing, his conception of it, its meaning for him, his idea of what he is trying to do in it. This book focuses rather on ordinary Everyman experiences as they happen to occur in the life of Paul Auster. Among these are a frightful car accident in which his family miraculously ( He would probably prefer the term 'luckily'  escapes serious injury and another a ride in a Minnesota snow - storm in which Auster with his admired father- in- law alongside makes a harrowing journey safely.<br />I found the book intelligent, interesting throughout except for one segment in which he writes at length about a movie plot. The book tells long- term readers of Auster much they would probably like to know about him. It does not however , at least for me, reach the level of intensity in feeling and perception that is the highest level of autobiographical writing.<br />It is again however a very interesting work.these are a frightful car accident in which his family miraculously ( He would probably prefer the term 'luckily'  escapes serious injury and another a ride in a Minnesota snow - storm in which Auster with his admired father- in- law alongside makes a harrowing journey safely.<br />I found the book intelligent, interesting throughout except for one segment in which he writes at length about a movie plot.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|[[ASIN:0525952926 Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy]]<br /><br />This book is an excellent follow up on the next generation of the families introduced in the first book of the trilogy.  Once you start reading, it is very difficult to stop. The book presents an excellent background of the main events leading to and during de Second World War. I have not evaluated the book with 5 stars becsuse some of atrocities by the Nazis and the Soviets during and immediately after the Second World War are described with too much detail.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Oh how I waited for Reflected In You to come out and let me just say it did not disappoint! I was definetly pleased with how the story continued on and kept me hooked till the very end. It was an emotional roller coaster with all these twist and turns, I seriously thought my heart was going to break on a few parts. I love the chemistry between Eva and Gideon even throughout the book I wanted to smack Gideon for being so hard headed and Eva for being so codependant. I cannot wait till the next and final book comes out. Great job Sylvia!
1582701709|5.0|I have the book and DVD. I have really enjoyed it. I have been using the tools to change my life. I don't even know how I came across this book. It happened when I was looking for something on YOUTUBE. That doesn't matter. I just know there is a reason for this to have come into my life. I have suffered from anxiety for years and since I have been reading, watching and applying this to my life things have changed. I will also ways use this in my life. I look forward to all the blessings coming my way.<br />Rhonda thank you for your book and movie. I can't get enough. I will soon be reading your next two books.<br /><br />Thank you again.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|To say I am emotionally spent after finishing this would be an understatement.  I love angst, drama and conflict and this book was packed with it.  The characters are both emotionally immature and extremely broken.  They are learning to love and trust together and their relationship is an addiction of sorts, one that comes with highs, times of extreme euphoria, and then falls to extreme lows.  Their love affair is strong, their inexperience apparent and the combination of those to thing can come together like a bad chemical reaction.  Reflected in You reveals more about the secrets Eva and Gideon keep and it was all very sad, however, I admire both characters even more after learning about what they have overcome.<br /><br />Eva is one of my favorite heroines ever.  She is strong, dedicated, honest, and loyal.  Those who meet her would never know the demons she hides inside.  She stumbles at times but then gets right back up and continues on.  I admired her relative normalcy and down to earth demeanor.  Eva got extremely jealous a times in Reflected to You but when you have such a good thing, I can imagine the fear of losing it is high.  Eva has to use some of her inner strength to learn to trust and let go of the doubts in her head.  This isn't easy when you are dating Gideon Cross.<br /><br />What most woman would give to get in the back of that limo with Gideon Cross...The man is intense, bossy but yet there is an incredible, kind, loving side to him.  Anytime there is a hero who can be bossy one moment and beyond sweet the next, I just want to eat him up.  Now Gideon had his moments in this one...I was a little upset at him a couple different times and wished he would be more emotionally available to Eva but every frown inducing thing he did seemed to be followed by two things that made me smile.  He could be very romantic..<br /><br />\\"It's what you see in me, angel,\\" he said quietly, his features softening.  \\"That you can know what I have in me and still want me as much as I want you.  I go to sleep every night afraid I'll wake up and you'll be gone.  Or that I scared you away...that I dreamed you-\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"I'd rather argue with you, angel, than laugh with anyone else.\\"<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"I'm obsessed with you, angel.  Addicted to you.  You're everything I've ever wanted or needed, everything I've ever dreamed of.  You're everything.  I live and breathe you.  For you.\\"<br /><br />These two are INTENSE!  You take two broken people and stick them in a committed relationship and issues are born.  When these two broken people have such passion and love for each other, things really get interesting.  There were some moments in this book that had me holding my breath (limo, lipstick, letter) because they were so intense, raw, and extreme.  These two belong together but they have to work at it.  I loved the up and down emotions I felt from going from a happy, sexy moment between the two to an intense, dramatic one.  Sylvia Day is a master of angst!<br /><br />\\"I'm going to fall,\\" I slurred, drunk with pleasure.<br /><br />\\"I'll catch you, angel, I'll always catch you.\\"<br /><br />I still love Cary and his ongoing sexual confusion.  He did not have an easy time in this book and I am hoping he gets his HEA in book three.  Oh, and then we were introduced to Eva's former flame, Brett, who just happens to be a freaking rock star.  Okay, so she already has Gideon, rich, sexy, controlling Gideon, and now she has a rock star who can't let her go.  Can we all get that lucky?  No, but seriously, Brett needs his own book because I kind of fell in love with him and his song writing abilities!<br /><br />I am going to be 100% honest and admit that I like the Crossfire Series more than Fifty Shades of Grey.  Why?  I feel there is more of a storyline with this one and a little less time is spent going between the sheets.  I loved Fifty Shades and don't want to take anything away from it but this series does a littlemore for me emotionally.<br /><br />To say I am hungry for Entwined to you would be an understatement!  What more can these two possibly have to go through??  I need to know how things end up for those two strong, emotional characters.  There is the part of me that never wants this to end.more for me emotionally.<br /><br />To say I am hungry for Entwined to you would be an understatement!

B0085YNML2|4.0|This game is great for killing time and is just fun to play. If \\"Angry Birds\\" and \\"Cut the Rope\\" had a baby- this would be it. If I had one complaint, it's that this game is a little too easy. Sadly, once you get the swing of things, it won't be long before you beat it.
