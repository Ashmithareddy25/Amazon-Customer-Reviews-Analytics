193700788X|3.0|-SPOILERS-<br /><br />I love Charlaine Harris. I love her writing -- mixing dramatic events with boring, everyday chores that make the characters seem more real. I love how Sookie has a monologue about how she wants to dress up and look good, why she chose the shirt she did, and that she has to work to keep her house clean. I can relate to Sookie -- minus the various number of lovers (of different species) that she's had.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this ending so much, but I was obviously also sad because when a beloved series comes to the end it's like a part of your life is coming to an end. Then fans raise high expectations for the ending, and I honestly think no author can live up to those heightened expectations. However, I believe fans deserved a better ending than this (now remember how much I said I love Ms. Harris while you read on).<br /><br />First of all, after having several books of Sookie either a) being chased by Eric or b) making passionate love to Eric because they were in a hot and romantic relationship...well, the ending of that relationship was horrible. I fell in love with Eric as much as Sookie did (yes, I know this means that I should seek professional help). And there was absolutely no closure in this story. Sookie claims she got closure, but it seemed as if she just gave up -- something that no real person would do after the relationship they've had. I was also extremely sad that Eric's page time was about a total of 5 pages in this 300+ novel.<br /><br />Then there's Sam...sure he did hang out in the background through all the books, but jeez -- jumping from BFF to having steamy sex in his trailer is just too big of a leap. And Sookie hints they'll probably get married, but really? It seems like the author was just trying to rush the two to get together either a) because she knew from the beginning they'd be together or b) she was crunching on a deadline. Either way, Sookie deserved to have a great love, and I just didn't feel itwith her and Sam.<br /><br />Lastly, the plot seemed just...boring. Yeah, she went to jail, she got lots of friends to help (which was a great way of bringing back lots of characters for this finale, so bravo!), and then there was a five page big dramatic event with some faeries and all that. But honestly the plot just kind of dragged on for a long time. We knew she wouldn't be charged, so why couldn't that have been solved up front and there could be more with the faeries?<br /><br />But alas -- the book is written and the series is over. Again, while this book wasn't my favorite, let me restate that I love, love, LOVE Sookie Stackhouse and Charlaine Harris (and Eric!!). I'm one of those fans with the huge expectations of a finale that could never be met, but this finale still could have been better. I highly recommend this book, but obviously only if you've read the previous 12. I recommend the series to EVERYONE (I really do recommend it to everyone I meet).<br /><br />[...]

1416972242|5.0|This review was originally written on my blog [...]<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />When it came to book two in the Mortal Instruments series the reading pace couldn't have been more different.<br /><br />I read this book in just six hours!<br /><br />How I read so quickly I have no idea, but from beginning to end it held me captivated and I couldn't put it down. Clary received multiple kudos from me in regards to keeping the line flexible firm between her and Jace. It would be extremely difficult for me to have that much self-control as I'm impulsive and when I fall, I fall hard. Their relationship became awkward and I missed their innocent love. It's clear to the reader that throughout the book neither have gotten over the other and I really hope something happens to change that soon because they've become a OTP for me and the angstyness is heart-wrenching.<br /><br />Overall I thought this book was better than the first. The explanations and history of the story were mostly out of the way and now we could get to the real plots on the timeline. I was very surprised by Simon's new life path. It was all very tragic and his `changing' scenes were emotional for me to read. Simon reminds me of one of my good friends and to try and imagine him in the same way was difficult.<br /><br />I found the relationship between Clary and Valentine interesting. Sure it seemed like she hated him but it was more for his ideals and treatments of others, not that he was her father. Did she wish Luke was her father? Yeah but she accepted that Valentine was her father very quickly and it made for an interesting dynamic between them. And when it comes to power I think her, Jace, and their father are the top contenders. But the three of them in the same room? Hello bizarro, awkward family!<br /><br />Also, Clary's new talent is slowly coming together. She gets her first Marks both drawn on and permanently, spontaneously added, which is awesome. Her ability is fascinating and I can't wait to see her go through more training to develop it. She'll be a kickass Shadowhunter!<br /><br />I have to give Clary credit though. If I was that in love with someone where they were always on my mind and I constantly compared other guys to him I don't know if I'd have to strength to stick to morality and keep the relationship platonic.<br /><br />It was just announced that this book will be made in to a movie as well and I -can not- wait! How very exciting! The ending was epic and I can't wait to see that on the big screen. So looking forward to the Bones movie!<br /><br />plot: A-<br /><br />I jumped right into this book as soon as I finished the first one (well as close as I could) and read it until the end. There's plenty of action, romance, angst, and drama to keep the reader focused and easily lose track of time.<br /><br />character: A<br /><br />The characters we have grown to love are back in this sequel to City of Bones. We get introduced to a couple of new ones, the Seelie Queen and Maia being more central to the series plot.<br /><br />Maia is fiesty and stands up for what she believes, but has a dark past that leads her to become who she is in this book. The readers also find that Clary has a negative quality, one which was revealed in the first book but plays a big role in City of Ashes - an inferiority complex.<br /><br />The Seelie Queen is a manipulative character who enjoys the torment of others for her own amusement. I don't really understand her purpose in the story as she hasn't done much to advance the plot besides give the readers something they wanted to see the most (even if it is strange).<br /><br />readability: A+<br /><br />As I wrote above, I read this book in 6 hours. I was so anxious to start reading it that as soon as I was able I picked it up and only put it down for basic human needs. Having a better understanding of the Shadowhunter world made this book an easy read and a lot less confusing than the first one. I also enjoyed reading this one far more than City of Bones.<br /><br />romance: B<br /><br />Despite Jace and Clary being siblings the tension between them is visually palpable. I still loved seeing romantic scenes between them because I hoped with all my might that they weren't actually related (and they certainly did too). Also a spark is igniting between Isabelle and Simon which I was wanting to happen. Though with Simon's new problem it might make it a bit difficult.<br /><br />length: A<br /><br />As with the first book I loved the chapter lengths and the breaks within the book. It helped keep the pace of reading level even though this book spanned only another week or two for the characters. I still find that concept strange but Cassie was able to pull it off to where it felt like the time was actually a lot longer for the book.<br /><br />Out of the entire book I think my favorite scene was when the trio (Clary, Isabelle, and Alec) broke Jace out of jail. Sure it was kind of weird as they're siblings but the tender scene between Jace and Clary just touched my heart. I love them together and it kills me that they can't be. Then later when they have to kiss in front of the Seelie Queen? Holy smokes that was steamy. Such a passionate romance and I love it. But it's not supposed to be that way. Ugh!<br /><br />Favorite Scene:<br />The book has already been signed on for the movie release! Super excited for that to come out. I think the scene I'm most looking forward to seeing is either the big kiss between Clary and Jace or the ending battle scene on the ship.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"There's no need to clarify my finger snap,\\" said Magnus. \\"The implication was clear in the snap itself.\\" - Magnus Bane
B00371XIJE|5.0|recommend to animal lovers and anyone in need of an uplifting story. One of the most moving stories ever filmed.
B001DHXT20|3.0|I guess I shouldn't blame the whole movie, I guess the whole &#34;hulk&#34; theme is quite cheesy and single-dimensional... aside from that it is an enjoyable movie for a sunday afternoon, with nothing else to watch.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is easily becoming one of my favorite albums of all times. It is on constant replay in my car. My favorite songs are Amsterdam, Hear Me, and Radioactive.<br /><br />They remind me of Coldplay a little bit, but they definitely have a distinct sound that I just LOVE.<br /><br />Don't question buying this album, just do it!
B003Y5RLR8|5.0|Elvis is named the King of Rock and Roll and it fits perfectly as he is still singing in CD's and he will never be forgotten. My grandchildren got to hear and know him through me and surprisingly they love his music. I am an old  BIG FAN .
1416955070|5.0|This was written for my blog [...]<br />  -----------------------------------------------<br />I first heard about Cassandra Clare when she was listed as an author that used to write fanfiction and was publishing a pulled story.<br /><br />What fandom she wrote for (at the time) I didn't know. Quite a few authors a couple of years ago pulled their Twilight fanfiction stories to publish and someone had made a list of them - she was on it. I had no idea it was originally written in the Harry Potter universe. Be that as it may, this book still sucked me in.<br /><br />I wanted to read this book series before the movie came out and they were highly recommended by my friend Hannah (@HannahDowning). The books came to me in the form of a Christmas gift, as I had requested. I've been looking for a new book series to fall in to ever since my other two can't-stop-reading-or-obsessing fandoms essentially completed last year (Harry Potter & Twilight). This seemed like the perfect one!<br /><br />The first couple of chapters where a little bit of action happens but it's mostly learning what Shadowhunters are, were quite `eh!'. It didn't grab my attention and I would stop reading after a couple of pages. The reading time for this book was four days.<br /><br />When I got to about chapter 6 or 7 as the plot thickened then it was difficult to put down. I read in between my finals and work so once my life settled the pages flew by. So quickly, in fact, that I finished it while on my three day trip to disaster training a couple of hours from my home. Without the next book with me. Major fail!<br /><br />Overall I thought it was a good introductory book that got me in to the series but it's not my favorite.<br /><br />plot: B<br /><br />The book is kind of slow paced despite the fact that it takes place over only a couple of days, but is essential to the introduction of the Shadowhunter world. You learn a lot of the different species, weapons, politics, and locations, each brought tothe reader in ways that are action-packed and full of drama, with a dash of romance on the side. The twist at the end (in my opinion) made it a heartfail moment and leaves you wanting to get right into the next book.<br /><br />character: A<br /><br />Clary comes across as a young girl with a big heart who tries to do more than she should. The fact that the drive during this story is saving those she loves, her mother and Simon, says a lot about her personality and I think is the theme of the book - love is strength. At first I didn't really like Jace, non-joking arrogance is not my favorite trait in a guy, but I loved the mysteriousness and danger edge to him. Though he came across as `unattainable'. Attractive? Yeah. Simon reminds me of one of my best friends so it was easy for me to like him. Beyond the three main, the rest of the crew brings lots of life and flair to the book and make for great side plots. Cassie did an excellent job creating in depth and lovable characters that can be developed and molded into amazing people.<br /><br />readability: A-<br /><br />Not having a very large vocabulary bank in my head this book was pretty easy to follow along with towards the end. Learning the lingo of all of the different creatures, weapons, and locations was a bit hard. I still don't even know how to pronounce some things but it flows in my head and that's what counts! Once I got into the book it was a quick read and I had no trouble moving forward, despite some trippy words.<br /><br />romance: B-<br /><br />There was a bit of romance in the development of Clary and Jace's relationship. It was gradual, realistic, and natural to the point where I was falling in love with Jace too. Cassie created to lovable guys in Jace and Simon and I easily love them both. Would not want to be in Clary's place when having to choose! Beyond this and some subtle flirting between Alec and Magnus, the romance line is short and if you're looking for a romance book you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />length: B<br /><br />I felt this book was the perfect length. I liked that it was broken up into three `parts' with a handful of chapters for each part. There was a lot of action and info packed in and didn't feel too rushed. The pacing was good as I didn't feel I was missing anything, however it's strange to know mentally that all of this is actually spanning like a week or two in Clary's life.<br /><br />Favorite Scene:<br />It's got to be Clary and Jace's first kiss. It was spontaneous, passionate, and gives the reader the first real inkling that Jace has any feelings for Clary at all. Plus the scene surrounding them sounds absolutely beautiful. One of my favorite first kisses to read!<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"It means `Shadowhunters: Looking Better in Black Than the Widows of our Enemies Since 1234′.\\" - Jace Wayland
B009NY43NY|1.0|Really this book doesn't even deserved to get 1/4 star ! No ERIC MEANS why bother and write it from the beginning and let us spend our money for it ! And Sam ? Really he is just a sidekick and I hated hem from the start so thank you for the script that I can't say that it is a book
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very addictive and fun game for all ages. You could spend hours playing it. Would totally recommend it to everyone.
0060594896|5.0|This book has changed the way I go about my whole life. After reading it, It really let me know how truly powerful I can be and am and there is no limit to what you can do in life. A must read
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far seems to be a lot of delays, but the pictures are clear and bright enough to see easily. I think that they should ask for reviews a bit later in the game.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Many things in the book were for shock value.  The sexual content was unnecessary to the plot of the book.
B0009VPFSW|4.0|Buy this memory while you can! This low capacity is rare, and as time goes on, your camera maybe a neat item of discussion before long as these will assuredly go away! Right price, right quality, and trustworthy data. Camera here is an Olympus E-10!

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Wow! This game is way more fun than I thought it would be. It's educational for the younger kids but fun for teenagers too.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I don't know a great deal about North Korea (I am not sure most people do)so I am trying to be careful not to take this book too literally and form an opinion of a country based on a novel. So far, I have found it to be well written and engaging. The main character is well developed, interesting and credible. Cultural contrasts are peppered thoughout the prose liberally and I am still deciding if this is a good thing or not but ultimately this is a story about a man and his journey and so far I remain intrigued and interested. I am not finished reading yet.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Easy reading.  Story was balanced between romance and suspense.  I have not seen the movie yet so I am interested in seeing how it follows along with the book.
0061719544|4.0|The prose is like his show. Light and very funny. A very candid snapshot at Craig, and some insight you don't get from his show. A must read for any fan!
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This movie was not only exciting, but shows that there is Hope even when things seem hopeless.  It was a beautiful and uplifting Spiritual journey.  Perserverance and one's inner strength and faith can lead you through anything, no matter how it seems at the time.  It is a beautiful love story with a feel-good ending.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I couldn't stop playing very addicting. get it you won't regret it once you start you won't stop playing.so what are you waiting for
B000LC4CVA|5.0|My wife and I love their voices,  and my wife chides me because I really like the plump little blonde,  Chloe- she is precious! Celtic Woman is one of the rare occasions where a producer or producers put together an ensemble that really clicks,  and works out as well as Celtic Woman has done.  I have to admit that 'Orinoco Flow' is mesmerising and these ladies make Irish Gaelic sound so amazingly smooth and beautiful; the written language is almost impossible to pronounce,  and the language seems very difficult,  but they make it a wonder to hear!  Even though I am partial to Swing,  Big Band,  and Jazz,  I woulld heartily recommended this DVD for any music lover.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I  am waitting for the next books to come out I hope soon, so I  c
B00A8ECU24|4.0|its a great game and fun, but with to many problems. having to spend such a large amount of money on an IN GAME PURCHASE and sometimes random crashes when its starting up or in mid-game.
B005SHTXN0|4.0|If you've never seen this movie, it definitely worth your time. I never realized how good of an actor Dustin Hoffman is until watching this movie. Besides The Grduate I guess. I recommend it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend's parents, they loved it!! The early to bed couple was up until after midnight they enjoyed it so much.
1599218011|5.0|Love, love, love this book.  It has changed my life...literally.  I saw Kris on Oprah many years ago and she really intrigued me w/her cancer and how she stopped it in her tracks by changing her diet and lifestyle.  But it took me a number of years to revisit her and really start looking into how she did it.  I rented her book from the library and was hooked, so I bought it and decided to follow her suggestions.  Now, I'm not as committed as she is, which is probably why I'm still struggling a bit, but I'm on my way.  I've had a spinal disease for 20+ years, only diagnosed 10 years ago.  It's not curable but treatable with management surgeries, I have about 9 a year and I take pain meds daily.  So I've started following her juicing, no sugar, no caffeine, and no milk diet.  I've reduced my meat (but not completely eliminated it, I love it too much).  My pain has changed.  It's still there, in the middle of my back but all the extraneous pain in my hips, neck, shoulders, etc. have dissipated.  I sleep much better and have so much energy.  I was always so tired but I have a glass of juice in the morning and boom, it's better than a jolt of coffee and you don't have a crash or feel hungry.  It's amazing.  I will continue to implement her ideas and strategies in hopes that I improve even more.  The other side effect is that I've lost weight.  Can't beat that.  My hubby was so impressed he started to follow the &#34;diet&#34;, or I should say lifestyle, as well.  He's lost his belly and double chin, his pants literally fall off of him and he feels so much better.<br /><br />Her writing style is great.  She's like talking to a girlfriend.  So much easier to read than those professional, doctorey books. Yes, she has a bit of trash talk sprinkled about...but get over it.  The message behind it is way too important to let that bother you.  If you are ready to get healthy, then check this book out.  It's complete, guides you slowly and even if you don't follow every single thing, you'll gain so much insight and knowledge into how the body works, you'll be highly tempted to improve your life.  Love you Kris, thanks for guiding us!!
B00AAQRNQ8|2.0|Purchased this mouse to replace an older model Sidewinder I had. By image, I thought the mouse had superb design and expected it to fit comfortably into my palm. While I enjoyed it large size so that my hand isn't cramped, I didn't enjoy the button layout. I am a lightweight female, so its not like this design wasn't meeting my expectations because I have large hands. The worst being the buttons on the left side. They feel extremely cheap and clunky. They protrude outward in a way that requires you to LIFT your thumb from the resting space in order to press them. The furthest button (toward the tip of the thumb) was almost impossible to reach without constantly accidentally hitting the larger middle button. I found it to be an awful mechanic in-game, as well as casually browsing (constantly hitting backward/forward). The wheel was a tad too far back, and I have to use my index finger to press the two buttons underneath the wheel, a big flaw. I sincerely think there should've been one button on the right side and two on the left. I also found some delay in responsiveness in the mouse. I changed the movement sensitivity, 1000hz, and x/y sensitivity; nothing fully removed the \\"airy\\" and delayed feel of the mouse.<br />The mouse is good for the price. I was considering returning it though for another product, but my boyfriend said he needed a new mouse so I just passed it on to him. I'll be looking for another mouse for myself now.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  Loved it as a kid and even now.  I try to expose my children to the things that I grew up with, had been thinking of this movie, and HAD to get it.  As I knew they would, my children loved it and as we watched, I found myself saying &#34;ooh! watch this part!&#34;  I was a little leery as the writing on it was Asian and the packing looked a little suspect, but it ended up just fine. I'm HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I liked this game because both my daughter and I can enjoy it together. There's not many child friendly games(non-violent) out there for her age group, so it's very refreshing when something such as this comes along to enjoy without shoot 'em up being involved. It is a game that is both challenging and fun and the rewards you get for passing certain levels, etc... is exciting to her and her friends. She and I have had lots of fun as well sitting together and playing it. Need more child friendly games such as this to be developed.
B00C0IYIN0|4.0|Watching it for the first time in years, some of the luster from childhood memory was tarnished. Still a good movie but does not stand the test of time the way classics such as Ferris Beuller's Day Off have.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It didn't end the way I wanted but it was an ok book. Wonder if the author planned it like this from the beginning.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I have been disappointed in Tom Cruise lately. The last Mission Impossible, actually, the last two, were not very good at all. This movie was decidedly different.<br />Well written and well executed, this movie is about honor and justice. There are a few Hollywood Leftist stabs at the military, and civilian contractors in Iraq, but that is par for the course these days. It's kinda like a little baby that is oh so cute, then it has to do a little dootie while you are holding it and as you are going \\"gaga googoo.\\"<br /><br />That aside, the movie was itself worth the price of admission. The cinematography, plot twists, acting, character development --all was 100%!<br /><br />Hopefully Tommy has seen enough good shrinks and is no longer apt to go nuts on Oprah's sofa. One can only hope.

193700788X|1.0|I have read everyone of these books and I must say that this one is the one I am most disappointed with. I liked the story but felt that the ending for all characters (for this to be the \\"last book\\") was rushed and unfinished. For me, if this was going to be \\"the last\\" novel..why not make everything with everyone final?? I also did not like the fact that Eric just let Sookie go like he did. I somehow always knew that Sam and Sookie would hook up eventually....Maybe the book that she releases in October will be better!!!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Made me determined to find the type of love JT professes.  It's silly I know but if I can feel that way about someone, I want it in return.  And the way he croons, you know he feels it too.  My favorite songs are That Girl, Strawberry Bubblegum, Pusher Love Girl and Mirrors.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this show because it's a take-off of the well none adventures of Sherlock Holmes. I really enjoy the twist on this particular show by having made Watson a woman. I see the 2 main characters having some romantic involvement somewhere in the future. Over-all, it is a very enthralling &#34;sleuth type&#34; show of which both my husband and myself enjoy. I missed the first have of season #1, so, I've had to watch the episodes I've missed on Amazon. I hadn't seen the history's behind Sherlock and Watson. So, I'm glad that I am getting to view the previous episodes since the earlier shows laid down the foundation of what the show is all about. The choice for the actors is &#34;right on&#34;, as far as I'm concerned. Very talented people. Finally, I hope this show is picked up for seasons to come, because I plan on staying tuned. It's a smile I can count on every Thursday night.  Thank you,  deAnna fox

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a awesome game and I play it all the time. It's a game that doesn't end! You buy dragons, buy habitats for the dragons and level up. You buy and create your own islands! You can cover them with decorations then breed or buy dragons and habitats to put on your island! I really guy enjoy this game because you can set it down and come back to it later and it doesn't end! You breed dragons or buy them with gems or Dragon coins then level them up by feeding. You can race dragons, breed dragons, you can level up dragons and so much more!! It's the first game that I played with dragons in it that doesn't include violence. This game is great for all ages and I would HIGHLY recommend that you get this awesome game!! WARNING: once you start ;playing it, you can't put it down!!! :)
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is a great series. It doesnt have the camp like Smallville. But a serious look at a serious hero. You see his flaws and his strengths. Each choice doesnt always take him in the direction he wants or needs. Just adds to the story as it grows. Just awesome!!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Just started playing but it seems like they've combined the best of both DH2 with DH3.  Graphics are good and the controls are simple to use.

098478280X|5.0|This book has some great sample interview questions that are very good to prepare for technical interviews. It is divided in very distinct areas and questions have various levels of difficulty. Great for people with not much interviewing experience as well as for seasoned engineers that want to review stuff and &#34;warm up&#34; days in advance another interview! Maybe not that great for interviewers though because I believe that this book is now becoming too popular among candidates!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved it.  I laughed and cried with the characters McKenna wrote about.  This book is fiction, but is based on the cruel reality of Irish orphanages from which these children survive and<br />findings happiness.
B0060D08JO|4.0|It never went away but evolved to a more dangerous place to exist. This builds well on the Tron mythos as well as adding its own unique flavor. Looking foward to the next movies.
B000005B0U|5.0|This is a favorite album of mine.  The music is great and features performances by varied artists.  Sadly many of the artists are no longer with us, but this album helps them live on.  I also rediscovered several great artists from the 60's and 70's - e.g. Sam Moore and Wilson Picket. The two &#34;jam session&#34; songs are a who's who of great rock and blues musicians.<br /><br />The movie is fun and the album is wonderful.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|All discs arrived in great condition. The movies play smoothly and the picture quality is great. I am still wanting the special features; however, for this price, I won't complain. I'd rather see all the stories than see a few and its special features.

B00A1C17EK|4.0|This collection of plays is really well done - but, in my view, it is not even.  Richard II is the best by far, but I was very disappointed with Henry V.  Here are some more specific comments about this set of performances:<br /><br />  Richard II stars the young British actor Ben Whishaw who has been very busy of late in \\"Cloud Atlas\\" and Helen Mirran's \\"Tempest.\\"  For me \\"Richard II\\" and this performance of the title role was the high point in the entire series.  Whishaw really captures Richard's self love and Christ ideation. The supporting cast was outstanding - led by Patrick Stewart as John of Gaunt and David Suchet (of \\"Poirot\\" fame) as Edmund, the Duke of York. Unfortunately I could not find an online complete cast list so I cannot identify all the actors.  But in addition to Stewart and Suchet I was also taken with the young actor who played the Duke of Aumerle and the actor who played the Earl of Northumberland. I found this to be the strongest of the 4 films, though there are a couple things worth noting.  1st, I found it very interesting that the director completely changed the ending - eliminating the character of Sir Pierce of Exton, who is the one who Shakespeare appoints to execute Richard.  He is replaced in the films by the character of the Duke of Aumerle, who is York's son and had been one of the conspirators.  By doing this the director strengthened the Christ analogy by having Aumerle play Judas.  It is too bad Shakespeare didn't think of this.  And if you think about it too long it starts to fall apart dramatically.  I think that was a misfire and a mistake.  Also, while I suppose that it is to be expected that plays where there is plenty of sword fights, battles and people having their heads cut off would include some blood and violence.  Nevertheless I found it notable that only Richard II of the 4 had explicit violence - namely the execution by beheading of Bushy and Greene done in all its gory excess. I had expected this to be the norm andwas ready for another beheading in Henry IV part 2 (the Archbishop of York and his compatriots) but no.  Bushy and Greene were it - so in retrospect it seems gratuitous.  But there are small details.  On the whole Richard II is a triumph and one of the best Shakespeare films available.<br /><br />  Next we come to Henry IV - parts 1 & 2.  Led by the stunning performance of Jeremy Irons as King Henry IV and backed by an excellent cast including Tom Hiddleston as Hal and Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff.  Also, Michelle Dockery, of \\"Downton Abbey\\" fame, plays Kate Percy, and the actor who plays Hotspur (I could not find his name on IMBD or the BBC sites!) are also quite extraordinary.  I especially liked how this Hotspur was completely focused on war and violence even to the point of disregarding his very beautiful wife (who at one point undresses in front of the messenger who gawks at her, even though her husband doesn't seem to notice at all!)  This has always been the way I read the play, but most performances I have seen have Hotspur melting eventually to his wife's charms - but not this Hotspur - he seems immune to the charms of his wife's beauty and her intense and devoted love! I also loved the performance of Henry Faber as the \\"good son\\" John of Lancaster, Hal's younger brother, who orchestrates with Westmorland the trickery that leads to the capture and execution of the rebellion led by the Archbishop of York.  Faber is fresh faced, innocent, charming, disarming, cold-hearted and merciless in that scene!  He is magnificent!  All of the scenes with Jeremy Irons sparkle, especially his confrontations with Hal. Iron's performance is one of the great film performances of any Shakespeare role IMHO.  I liked the Eastcheap crowd led by Falstaff.  This Falstaff was a little more smarmy than others I have seen who tended to be more jolly.  But Julie Walters as Mistress Quickly is also outstanding.  I have to say, that in contrast to the theater where my experience isthat these scenes can steal the show, for me in the film version they seemed claustrophobic and I was always glad to return to Court or the battlefield.  I should give a shout out to the actor who plays Justice Shallow.  This was a sensitive and moving portrayal of a character who is usually just a joke or the butt of a joke.  I also should say that found it a little disconcerting that the few characters who were in both Richard II and Henry IV were played by different actors.  I would have preferred the same actors to play their roles in the whole series, except when age prevents it.  The exception would be Bollingbrook to King Henry IV - they are drastically different characters.  But I cannot for the life of me understand why they would have replaced the terrific Northumberland from Richard II.  There are some small cuts which are annoying - we never see John of Lancaster saving his father during the battle of Shrewsbury and we do not see why Falstaff is laying as if dead on the ground (he was attacked by Douglas in the play - but not in the film).  Minor cuts, true, but kind of needless in my view.<br /><br />  When we come to Henry V then the cuts take center stage as the number #1 weakness of this film.  The character of Captain Gower is eliminated and all of the banter between him and Fluellen is cut. But the worst cut is the removal of the conspiracy scene.  Olivier cut this scene from the film back when he filmed Henry V during World War II, and then it was a conscious choice for wartime and political reasons.  I am not sure if there were such reasons this time around, but for me it ruins the narrative and turns it into a jingoistic ride to the glorious victory at Agincourt.  I cannot imagine any good reason to cut this scene.  It doesn't take that long and it deepens the narrative.  This is, in my view the single worst thing about this series. On the other hand, I thought turning the boy (Falstaff's page) into the chorus at the end was brilliant.  Even so,sorry to say the battle scene at Agincourt is not as good as the Kenneth Branagh film in my view.  There was certainly more attention paid to historical accuracy in the battle scene in the Branagh film.  They pass over the French murder of the boys at the baggage train with barely a mention, and if you want to really want to understand how it was possible for Henry to win the battle of Agincourt when the odds were so stacked against him you will have to consult another source because you won't get many hints here - except perhaps divine intervention or luck.  The Branagh film devotes enough time to the long bow archers and the field conditions that one can get a better sense of why the French lost this battle.  I enjoyed Tom Hiddleston as Henry, though I liked him better as Hal.  He is a fine actor and I would love to see him do these roles on stage.  Other complaints: I did not like that Henry had no part in the hanging of Bardolph.  The hanging was over by the time Henry finds out about it.  That weakens his character and the play.  I also did not like the delivery of the famous St. Crispen's Day speech for his small group of officers.  It somehow took the power out of the speech. As mentioned above Fluellen is a cipher in this production, and nothing really matters except Agincourt.  Even so, there are fine performances by Catherine of Valois and the Duke of Exeter.  I also enjoyed the performance of the French actor who played Montjoy. (Curious that French actors were cast in most of the French roles, excepting the King - it was rather glaring he and the Dauphin that he was the only French character without a French accent.)<br />  In conclusion I would say that it is definitely is worth watching and owning this series.  Richard II is the strongest, Henry V is the weakest.  Wikipedia lists this series as \\"The Hollow Crown, part 1.\\"  Does this mean that we can expect a part 2?  Henry VI, parts 1, 2, 3 to Richard III perhaps?  That would be nice.  But next time,go easy on the cuts please and keep the casts stable from play to play.  It adds to the strength of the production.

0307387178|3.0|A simple story that got stretched and diluted to produce a book. There probably was not enough information about McCandless to fill a book. There were many other stories in the book that were presented to illustrate a comparison to Alex's tragedy. I wanted to read about him, not about various other men who wandered into Alaska or a desert decades ago and were never heard from since. I couldn't 'get into' this book. I would not recommend it.

I'm just...sad- sad that Ms Harris didn't care enough about Sookie or her fans. I really didn't care who Sookie ended up with by this point. This book was AWFUL. I want my time and my money back. Knowing how Ms Harris ended this series, I will not be buying anymore of her books.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really loved this book and have receommended it several times already. So many layers, and so well written. The author had just as deep an understanding of the emotions and psychology of his characters, as he did of the legal system. It was not heavy-handed or predictable, but shed intelligent and thoughtful light on a very gut-wrenching and controversial topic. I was very impressed.

B007AR7OGE|5.0|As was pointed out in an earlier review, the purple/lavender covered box set is NOT the original \\"First Lady of Song\\" box set.  Be aware of which version you're purchasing before completing that order!<br /><br />That said, how does the 48 disc box set stack up?  Honestly, I haven't gotten through all of it yet to offer an album-by-album breakdown and I don't know enough about the full scope of her work to tell you whether this material is a representative sampling.  Being that we're talking about Ella here, I think it's safe to say that I won't be disappointed as I get through the material.<br /><br />As near as I can tell, what we're dealing with here is a EU box set that takes full advantage of the fact that, on that side of the Atlantic, copyrights on recorded works only last 50 years (a quick perusal of the somewhat Spartan book that comes with the set reveals that none of these sessions are more recent than 1960).  What this means for us, the prospective buyer, is an EXHAUSTIVE box set of Ella's work dating back as far as 1937.  Given that it's unlikely that anyone involved in these recordings is still alive to collect royalties, I do manage to sleep at night even though these discs are likely \\"public domain\\" insofar as the publisher of this set is concerned.<br /><br />While I don't have other CD issues to do A-B comparisons with, I can attest to the fact that the sound quality so far has been exemplary.  I'm detecting no crude vinyl rips or odd audio artifacts that seem to accompany cheap compilations.  It seems entirely likely that these were copies of existing digital masters.<br /><br />It's worth noting that, while this set claims to include \\"the songbooks,\\" it does not include ALL of them (I counted three that were not included - Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern, and Johnny Mercer), so it's not a replacement for the \\"Complete Songbooks\\" box set if that's what you're after.<br /><br />Another anomaly worth pointing out is the correlation between the titles of some of these discs and separately issued albums.  All of these discs, so far, seem to correspond to an album Ella released - though, at least one disc uses a different title (Disc 18, \\"Smooth Sailing,\\" registers as \\"Lullabies of Birdland\\" with identical track listings on my PC).  The track listing may also be completely out of order when compared to the album of the same name.  In the MP3 era, this is a minor gripe, but well worth noting for the purists out there.  Likewise, if you're hoping for bonus material, you're out of luck.  The few albums I have checked (Cole Porter Songbook, notably) only include the tracks originally issued.<br /><br />If someone has a chance to do an A-B comparison with the American CD issues that match up with some of these discs, I'd be curious to know the results.  For the price (barely over $1 per disc as of this writing), you can't go wrong if looking for an introduction or to expand your collection on the cheap.ome of these discs and separately issued albums.

B000JLSM00|5.0|This is *not* my favorite John Wayne movie.  Oh, it's up there ... top 10 ... but it's not my favorite.  However, it is one of the most visually appealing and it's one of the rare cases where The Duke's character actually changes (markedly, steadily, and believably) over the course of the film.  Hmmm ... I guess I won't say much more because one can issue Spoilers even for a film as old as this one.  I'm guessing that Jeffrey Hunter is sort of overlooked in this film, but he holds his own on screen with The Duke (and that *cannot* have been easy to do) and makes his character believable, sympathetic, and ... hmmm ... again, to avoid giving anything away ... gets John Wayne to listen to his &#34;better angels&#34; over the course of the film.

B00BN4JQ6G|4.0|Ahead of Kings of Leon's new album (expected later this year in September), their record label has issued this handy collection box. Plain and simple, \\"The Collection Box\\" (2013 release; 5 CDs; 1 DVD) brings you all of KOL's studio albums: 2003's Youth & Young Manhood, 2005's A-Ha Shake Heartbreak, 2007's Because of the Times, 2008's Only By The Night, and 2010's Come Around Sundown. Also included is a concert DVD called Live at the 02 London, England. All discs are packaged in LP replica mini-jackets.<br /><br />Just a few notes on the CDs (5CDs, 66 tracks; 237 min.), the first four albums are a straight-forward reissue. But note that the most recent album \\"Come Around Sundown\\" is included here in its 'deluxe edition', with 3 additional tracks (a terrific \\"Celebration\\", which is one of the better songs of the entire album and by all means should've been included on the regular album), and remixes of \\"Radioactive\\" and \\"Closer\\", the latter being completely redone.<br /><br />As to the DVD, it is a straight-forward reissue of the 2009 release \\"Live at the 02 London, England\\" (22 songs; 100 min.), and I'm guessing that this inclusion could be quite enticing to those that 'like' KOL but wouldn't otherwise be bothered to buy their only concert DVD to date. This was recorded at the height of their tour in support of the band's monster-breakout (in the US anway) album \\"Only By the Night\\", and the selist reflects this (8 of the album's 11 tracks are on here).<br /><br />Bottom line: if you have the urge to buy most of KOL's output in one fell swoop, you cannot go wrong with this. No, this is NOT the entire KOL (tons of B sides and one-offs such as the excellent 2006 live EP called \\"Day Old Belgian Blues\\" are MIA), but this is not the intent of this box set. On top of that, this is being released at a very fan-friendly price, and if you do the math, you realize you are getting each of the 6 discs for basically the price of an EP each.<br /><br />Music: 4.5 stars; New relevance: 3.5 stars (due to inclusion of Come Around Sundown extra tracks; Packaging: 4 stars; Economic bang-for-the-buck: 5 stars.ce: 3.5 stars (due to inclusion of Come Around Sundown extra tracks; Packaging: 4 stars; Economic bang-for-the-buck: 5 stars.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I have been reading comic books, mainstream comic books, such as \\"The Avengers,\\" for mumble-mumble years.  This movie was \\"acceptable\\" to me in all of my \\"The Big Bang Theory\\"-like snarkiness about comic book movies.  However, the level to which this movie was a blockbuster surprises me.  The product itself is 5 star (that is, the Blu-Ray, etc.) as far as I can tell (I have not yet watched every minute of extras), so the 4 star rating is really for the film I suppose (but, really, how often do you order a big star, big screen blockbuster on Blu-Ray and get something that doesn't work?).  Okay, I'm probably breaking the tie between 4 and 5 stars because of Cap's uniform (read ala Seinfeld: \\"What's the deal with that?\\").

I am through the first 16 levels and I look forward more, but they are getting more challenging.  It's frustrating when night falls and you are on the last task.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought the movie was very good and followed the book closely. Can't wait for the next movie this summer!
B00BB22GSU|5.0|this album is truly amazing! so many good songs, specially Ya Hey. if you're a fan of VW, and feel skeptical, trust me you will not be disappointed with this purchase.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Royal Envoy is a fast moving game.  Lots of fun to play and keeps your interest. Once you get into the swing of playing you can't stop.  Very fast moving.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just gotta my new Kindle Fire HD,  but needed some free app's I start searching for app on  Kindle app store. I came across app calculator that it very helpful .<br />I finally found a calculator that is clear and easy!!!<br />Thanks
193700788X|5.0|I rated this five stars to offset all the one star reviews; without that context I probably would have given it four stars. Charlaine will never be a great \\"literary\\" author, and so what. These books are so sweet and quaint and fun. I loved the ending, and I think the readers who wanted Sookie to end up with Eric were really deluded - Eric is the sexy guy you have the hot affair with, not someone who can provide any kind of happily ever after. I think Sookie has matured a lot over the course of the series, but still maintains her sweet country nature that endeared her to me in the first place, and she is now in a better place, not only romantically, but in her community, and financially, which was so nice to see, since she started off rather isolated and cash-strapped. All in all a very satisfying conclusion.
1608955702|5.0|A very good follow up from Neil's previous two books (on camera flash and off camera flash).  I especially liked the fact that Neil tackles common lighting problems and offers solutions.<br /><br />In my opinion, this book is not for a photography novice.  At a minimum, you need to understand the basic elements of exposure (aperture, shutter speed, and ISO).
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I will be the first to admit I did not have high hopes for this series. There has only been one true Dr. Hannibal Lecter as far as I'm concerned, and was hesitant to even try. However, I have been regularly left breathless. The way this show's been lit and shot is gorgeous, more like a serious film than a television show. I hear tell, from friends, that it's gory, but it's to my taste, I'm not bothered. The subtlety in the dialogue and framing is lovely, if you take the time to pay attention and Lecter is as seductive as always. The actors are all excellent and the story tastes just like it should. If you've read the books, or just seen the movies, that's okay too, I think you'd do well to give this a shot.
B0084HJE0S|1.0|THis is not a book, it is more akin to a highschool essay. I guess you get what you pay for, though. It was just a total waste of time.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I wanted to hate these DVDs and then write a negative review.  I'm a TOS fanatic that has seen these episodes dozens of times each.  I'm so fanatic that I reject the motion pictures and all other Star Trek related programs.  TOS only for me!<br /><br />So, I was SHOCKED when I watched these episodes and LOVED them!  How is this possible?  First, unlike George Lucas going in and digitally altering storylines, these stories remain the same with absolutely NO changes.  The only changes are an updating of the special effects shots.  But even those are faithful and true to the series.  And the picture quality has been beautifully remastered.<br /><br />The way I see it, if today's technology existed at the time Star Trek was aired this is what the show would have looked like.  So it's not anything new, just an enhancement.  Because of this I can give the remastered Star Trek TOS five stars!
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Really enjoyed this film it had a good story and a few scary moments. Would definitely recommend this film to and movie enthusiasts
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Not the best app but it works very well it is easy to use and very handy if you need to wake up early in the morning
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is quite detailed in how the Mars astronaut survives. The story is good enough, but the tremendous details on how the main character manipulates his environment, using limited materials at hand, to survive in order to get rescued makes it much better.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Closure at last!  I started this series 14 years ago.  I doubted that it would ever reach a conclusion.  I also wasn't certain if all the loose end could be tied back together but Brandon Sanderson wove a masterful ending.
030758836X|3.0|I read all three of her books back to back from Sharp Objects to Dark Places to here and I don't quite know what to think about \\"Gone Girl\\".  While the writing is sharper and more mature the plot and pace seem less of a page-turner than the other two and I just didn't feel that it was as interesting.  This is not the Stephen King type book the others were and without that mystical or slightly unnerving feel it just didn't do it for me.  If I had seen this story on 20/20 I probably would have changed the channel as it's just not the attention getter that I had become accustomed to expect from Flynn.  Oh well, try, try again.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I watched this movie on Amazon Prime for free.  I had heard the good reviews but had never read the book so was not very interested.  However, I decided to watch it and found it to be very entertaining.<br /><br />It was a bit dark because it is about children killing each other but the leadup to the actual games does not make it seem as morbid.  I liked most of the actors.<br /><br />I'll probably watch the sequel based on the first movie.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|must watch<br /><br />18 words required so lame.<br /><br />it's a great movie! watch it then read the book too.<br />both great. so different
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Hilarious is the description for this movie. Brandon Fraser plays this role to a T. I've viewed it several times.
B009AMANH4|5.0|If this movie is factual, for me it shed a new light on Lincoln's political abilities and cunning. The photography is set to the time period and places the viewer into the environment.  This is a must see movie for those who like documentaries.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|Useless app that does nothing but install ad-ware. I couldn't delete this app fast enough. Don't waiste your time... bad joke!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Actually really like this game. Used to play it on facebook all the time. It is one of my favorite hidden object games.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|Love PJ and love this documentary.  Great old videos and live performances from the early years.  Would recommend this to any rock and roll fan
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book!!! Any one could related to this book! Flowers actually having meaning and this author blends redemption, forgiveness and love all together.  Its a feel good book.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|An interesting concept. Was definitely a read that kept drawing me back wanting to read more and am on the next book now.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Four year old son and husband have been enjoying this game all day.  Coins could regenerate faster or I am going to go broke buying coins to keep the two of them busy.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation and I could not put it down. If you like SF you would be doing yourself a disservice not to read it.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|The actors and the scenery are great. Violence is a little much and did they really say the f word that much in those days???
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|It was a really good packaging but the slipcover had some damages at the end of the corner. But I still thought the packaging was good but could have been a little better.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I have heard mixed reviews on this movie, but I liked it. Mostly because he is one of my favorite superheroes.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Love being able to watch or listen to this movie anytime without being confied to a specific room.  I can start and stop it anytime.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|It was very well done.  Liked it a lot although have not finished all the episodes. Violence is a little much.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I just got the album in the mail today and was super happy! When the songs were released on Youtube I wasn't shocked. Demi's songs are AMAZING like usual!! This year Demi put more of the rocker edge then she has in her last 3 albums. Incredible Job Demi
B001DPHDCY|4.0|I Bought it for a christmas present for my nieces. they liked it so I am happy with the purchase.
B002FWW996|5.0|I love being able to watch this movie anytime.  I love the whole series of Die Hard but this one has to be my favorite.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Much of the latest in technology is included with the political and psychological insight needed to make this a fascinating view of possibilities. I was inspired to continue with the Shift series and with some other related tales by other authors. One is completely drawn into the life below of the characters.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The female Disney character my tomboy of a daughter really relates to.  Loved it in the movie theater, and found it just as enjoyable seeing it again!
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I Bought it for a christmas present for my nieces. they liked it so I am happy with the purchase.
140011425X|5.0|The audio book was in wonderful condition, and love the whole series.  Also I did not have to wait to long to get the book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My very first &#34;back to reading&#34; since having my twins.  Loved it!  Totally recommend to anyone who likes action and adventure.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Loved the books and the movie.  The movie's pretty true to the book with some minor changes that don't detract at all from my enjoyment of the film.  Well done!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I really liked it, but....I really want to know how they will make three movies out of a book that was not even three hundred pages long. I mean I see that they are adding in stuff that they talked about the aftemath or mentioned certain people. now they are showing them, and we get to see what Gandalf was actually doing when he went away. It will be interesting to see what Peter Jackson has envisioned happened on Gandalf's quest and some of the other things he will add in.
B009VB9VKY|5.0|This was a excellent movie and being able to watch it on the go was wonderful. I purchased this movie so I could watch it while at the airport.
0226752275|3.0|This review pertains to this EDITION of Frankenstein (not Frankenstein the novel).  Frankenstein, as a novel, is easily one of my favorites and I have read it several times.  Frankenstein earns 5 stars, this edition, however, is not for everybody.<br /><br />This edition of Frankenstein has a few features that should make it useful in a classroom setting. In my opinion, these features are distracting if you're reading for enjoyment.  Each page has line numbers which make referencing very easy and will help a class run more efficiently if the teacher wants to refer to several different passages during discussion.<br /><br />However, this edition is actually MULTIPLE editions combined into one. Often, there are two versions of a passage alongside each other which show Shelley's revisions and even some revisions of another third party. It gets distracting pretty quickly.<br /><br />I gave this 3 stars for the general population, but I believe it is worth 5 stars to literature teachers who also wish to incorporate writing skills into their lesson plans. This edition shows (at least to a small extent) how Shelley worked to improve her writing.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read this novel before watching the movie; this is a book that you can't put down! Ordered it for my Kindle on a Sunday, finished it Tuesday and that was because I had to work inbetween. Highly recommend it.
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|When I first watched this movies years ago I did not care for it that much. I watched it a year or so later and liked it, then again and loved it.
B0095P33IW|5.0|This movie was \\"Great!\\" I liked everything about it! The action scenes were well done, the choice of actors was well thought out!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Simple &amp; fun game! I totally love it - easy way to waste time!!! 100% better than the holiday Coin Dozer!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the peak of modern fantasy, simply stated. Martin has become an icon to me through his work due to the outstanding quality. He creates a very realistic world that is surrounded by literally hundreds of meaningful characters.
B0039208CG|4.0|Not the best Batman movie but still a good one. I love Jim Carey in this movie, how he starts out as the lonely scientist that no one will listen too. He then transforms into the evil mastermind The Riddler that everyone will cower from.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This game is pretty fun.What you do is you do is drag the rod  to the right to go right and left to go left and down to go down and up to go up and try to get as many dots as you can.Well that is all.Hope you get this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really well written, extremely captivating. I bought the immersion reading and it was really great. Can't wait for the movie to come out!
0547391005|5.0|I bought this book to share the joy of Curious George with a little guy I care for.  I usually buy books separately instead of a collection because either the book is cumbersome or the quality is not as good.  The book is wonderful!  The colors are vibrant.  The paper it is printed on is top notch.  The pictures are clear.  It comes with a CD of all the stories - which are very nicely done.  I am really glad I bought it and so is my little charge.  He loves it!  And I love adding this to my collection of classic children's books.
B009OWGMYI|5.0|I love listening to this band, and when Amazon gave me a $2 credit for MP3, i jumped on the cd for a couple extra bucks. Great bunch of songs together for a great steal of a price.
193700788X|1.0|I have read the Sookie books through the end of book #8.  I must admit the last one wasn't the greatest but I didnt' hate it and was waiting to read the others once the finally book was released.  Now that I know she completely destroys the characters I have grown to love I will not bother reading the remaining 5 books.  You got me Ms. Harris but you won't get a dime more from me.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I bought this in spite of all the bum raps it was getting such as Tom Cruise was too short for the role.  (Jack Reacher is 6'6&#34; in the books.)  Bottom line, I really enjoyed this film.  Robert Duvall's appearance was great and the story was not too complex or too simplistic.  I hope Tom Cruise tries another Reacher role.  He did not do anyone a disservice in this one.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|To be fair, it was a gift so I did not see the movie but I'm sure it was received well.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I really like the voice option in this. The thesaurus, everything, it is easy to use. I haven't found that its lacking in any way.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I had been using the free portion of this app to watch movies, but I decided to watch anime and other movied from other sources and decided to buy the full version. So far it's been great and I haven't had any issues with this app, I would recommend it.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I was excited when I received this movie, because I got to share this movie with my hubs on Mother's Day 2013...I married an awesome guy who watched all 5 movies that day!!!
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I always enjoyed the series...by the way I'm 73 years old...watched it recently with my 43 year old son and 19 year old grandson...it certainly entertained the generations....!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am a puzzle addict, and this is hands down the best puzzle game I have ever played. The developer should hopefully be working on a follow-up and if they are, than they will have my monies
B004X2M3N8|5.0|It took me a while, but the 11th doctor finally grew on me. I really enjoyed watching this season, and it was hard to just watch one episode.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like it but it hard to earn heart gems and I rly need scootalo and thts the only job I need!!!!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Even those who do not hold &#34;original Trekkie&#34; credentials love this movie. It is simply a great movie. Now, add the prequel component to the Star Trek empire of stories: Amazing. Simply Amazing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Even though this book has been out for many years, this was the first time I have read it.  Now I ask myself, \\"Why did I wait so long.\\"  Good storyline, great character build and just a great read.
1433537427|5.0|I'm loving the study notes.  The notes are incredibly thorough, often taking up two or three times as much page space as the text itself.  Very useful for deeply digging into a passage.  It's a good size, and quality materials.
147674355X|5.0|Moving and deeply emotional, HOPELESS was the sort of novel that understood all my loves in a read, deep in my soul, and will remain one of my favourites, ever.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has a way of reaching so many readers that others don't in the way they resonate with me. She's not cheesy, but her characters are intense and strongly in love. She's not a clone, yet she writes about types of characters many other authors in her genre write about, yet no one can better her talent in her characters you love so much. I loved Sky from the beginning. Her best friend and mum are likeable, which is rare for me in fiction--secondary characters tend to fade away and be forgotten in almost all else but this novel. When I got to know Holder, and watched him develop, I became as close to him as I did with Sky.<br /><br />Without a doubt, HOPLESS is a standout leader in the New Adult trend, and I'm so proud to say I'm one of many who experienced this novel.<br /><br />Absolutely recommend. Big 6/5 stars
B001V7WC1Q|3.0|I have already watched the original with sub titles so my opinion is somewhat skewed.  I found the dubbed version simply did not have the same impact.  While i generally don't enjoy reading movies you have to watch the original to understand that you get much more out of it than the dubbed which actually sounds somewhat amatuerish and I did not enjoy it near as much.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book surprised me at how realistic it made a fantastic situation seem.  If you are an engineer, you will really enjoy this book.  It isn't written over the readers heads, but it flows at a quick pace.  A great tale!
B003KRGCTI|4.0|Once again, Denzel Washington nails the role of Eli.  While yet another post-apocalyptic story, the overall plot for this one is more entertaining than most.  I originally saw this one on my laptop inside my big rig, having downloaded it via a cellular modem, and it remains a part of my digital library to this day.  It looks far better on my 42 inch TV at home, connected to my laptop via an HDMI cable, than it did on the much smaller 17 inch screen on my laptop, but both viewings were great.<br /><br />This one is rated R due to frequent due to especially brutal and graphic violence, and for some reason for the language used (kids hear worse in school and from their parents).  I wonder sometimes about how and why they rate movies the way it is done, given that I've seen movies with far more violence and course language get PG-13 ratings.<br /><br />As I said, Denzel Washington plays the main character and hero of the movie, a wandering warrior on a mission named Eli.  Gary Oldman's acting as the bad guy is spot on.  The supporting roles by Jennifer Beals (Flashdance, The L Word) and Mila Kunis (&#34;Jackie&#34; on That 70's Show, &#34;Meg Griffin&#34; on Family Guy) is equally superb.  The story centers around an obsession by the bad guy over books, one particular book he wants being carried by our hero.  I'm not going to reveal the twist to you, you'll have to figure that one out for yourself (I refuse to write spoilers into my reviews).
0060853972|3.0|What happens when you combine Gaiman's badassery and Pratchett's irreverent humour? (I guess you already figured this book)<br /><br />While reading Good Omen's I tried to keep track of everything modern and historic that got poked fun at (yep, lost count.) I must assure that Good Omen's would only offend the strongest ______ (insert humiliated subject) given the good natured tone of the piece.<br /><br />My concern about this book is there is hardly room for storyline between larks. Despite being the most epic topic imaginable I found myself struggling to actually care too much about what was actually happening. Crowley and Azi where relatable protagonists, but Adam induced yawns.<br /><br />I guess big fans of either author should check this out, although newbies should check out one or the other first (just my opinion)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed viewing this series.  I thought it was kind of soap-opery at first, but the script and depth of the characters got better as the series went on.  Now I'm waiting (as patiently as I can) for Season 3 to hit Prime.
096798467X|5.0|The one thing I want to makae this summer and with this book, which is easy to read and has lots of drawings, will help me get it done!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I originally saw Avatar a couple of years back, when all the silly protest by LGBT groups AND religious conservatives arose due to how popular the movie was.  Quite frankly, as a member of the LGBT population and a minister, I don't get what all the protests were about, since what was being protested had nothing to do with the movie, the story or plot, the characters, etc..<br /><br />As for the movie itself, James Cameron created a masterpiece.  The story quickly becomes familiar, a technologically advanced culture invades another, less advanced culture, and the advanced one is willing to commit genocide to insure ever increasing demands for more profits.  Despite the fact this type of plot has been already done many times before, Cameron manages to keep the story interesting and entertaining.  Then he throws in some of the best animation I have ever seen (on par with Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within), and gives an all to familiar and tragic reality indigenous people face (and have for centuries), and gives it an interstellar scifi fantasy spin.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13, due to graphic war violence, some sensuality (between the two main characters, it's fairly tame when compared to what is on TV, kids probably see more such behavior with their own parents), language, and because one or more characters is smoking (I hadn't noticed the last one, but I guess it happens).  The graphic war violence, to my thinking, would be the main reason to think twice before letting younger children watch this one, a decision best left to parents.<br /><br />When I first ordered this one, I overlooked the fact that it included a 3D Bluray version, which I can't play anyway.  Given how spectacular the movie is with regular Bluray, I can only guess that the 3D version must be even better.  Some day...  LOL  I decided to give the DVD version to a friend.<br /><br />Anyway, whether you are a fan of scifi fantasy or not, this movie is very well done, with an excellently told story and spectacular animation, graphics, and special effects.  This one is an excellent addition to any movie collection.ory and spectacular animation, graphics, and special effects.  This one is an excellent addition to any movie collection.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I had a smaller shoulder camera bag and finally had more equipment than room. I was looking online at prices and everything that seemed big enough was quite expensive. I randomly found this one and decided to take the gamble. I am actually surprised on how large it is. The build of it seems average compared to what something 3-5 times the price. For a beginner photographer hobbyist, this bag is perfect for you.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game because of the bright plants, the variety of gardens you can build,and the fact that I'm learning as I'm playing.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The good: The movies all look great. I'm a fan of all six, and they have never looked better. The features are cool and numerous. It's a top notch presentation.<br /><br />The neutral: I'm 50/50 on the changes made to the films since 1997. I LOVE Victory Celebration, Jedi Rocks, CG Yoda in TPM, and a lot of the CG ship shots. Young Anakin as a ghost, Vader yelling NOOO! in RotJ, and Jabba in ANH are less appealing to me, but I'll live. I discovered Star Wars in 1996, so changes are something I expect.<br /><br />The bad: I'm an Episode 1 apologist, but I've always had problems with the animatronics used for the Neimoidians. Yoda can be CG, Ewoks can blink, but neimoidian scenes still look like a poorly dubbed kung fu flick? C'mon. I'd love to see this fixed in a future release.<br /><br />So here's the reason I couldn't give it five stars: Paramount was able to give us Star Trek TOS blu-rays that contained both the special editions and the original episodes, both in high definition. If a 50 year-old TV show can do that, why can't Star Wars? In many ways I prefer the special editions, but the original theatrical cuts are a part of cinema history and they need to be available in stunning hi-def.<br /><br />Even so, I give this four stars. This is easily up there with the Lord of the Rings blu-rays. It's just a shame they couldn't include the original cuts.
B004QK6TZA|5.0|The word 'masterpiece' is entirely apropos here. The band finds true form on this massively impressive, layered, and melodic set of songs. I can see why it took more than two years to complete.<br /><br />The two-cd version is a must-have. &quot;Ocean Cloud&quot; is beyond epic. This is Marillion's best album and it's no overstatement to put it on the same level as anything from Floyd, Rush, or The Beatles. Yes, it is that good.
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|Imagine my total surprise when I ran across this CD. It of course helped that Amazon was giving away a &#34;free&#34; song from this Album and I gave it a listen. I'm Glad I did. After sampling the rest of the songs, I bought the complete CD and I'm very happy with it.  It's now a part of my play list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It has fantastic crew andyou move into new thing in different parts of the world. If I could actually be in the game I would want you too make me win. It's just a fantastic game too play, now I'm speechless!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|We enjoyed it very much.  Loved the action and Tony Stark's humor.  Love the suit or maybe Tony !  Great.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Purchase d for my kindle fire. Nice boards, would have liked to have the tile boards in more shapes but for mindless fun, this app is good. Tiles on my kindle are large enough for me not to use my readers.
B008602KQI|4.0|I'm a sci-fi fan and have wanted to see this movie for a long time.<br /><br />Although the story might seem a bit over the top of reality, and we'd like to think &#34;Hunger Games&#34; won't ever happen, we probably thought that George Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; was also an unlikely scenario, and yet the entire world is more than half way there.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|And it is a big &quot;but&quot;. A lot of the mechanics are time based. You can spend in game &quot;crystals&quot; to make the  timers complete, and also to buy in game equipment and potions. A lot of the items offered are either over levelled(gear) or also time based(potions).<br /><br />Enemy scaling needs to be tweaked a bit in my opinion as well. It would take a lot of grinding to be able to make  it further into the game without spending real money on in game items.<br /><br />The fact that they make you spend crystals to expand your inventory space(it is rather small to begin with) and only a two more slots  per inventory upgrade is very irksome. Making each subsequent inventory upgrade cost more crystals makes this game seem like nothing more than a cash grab app.<br /><br />If you like dungeon crawlers this game can be quite fun if you don't mind grinding.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|All the actions in this film were taken as a result of insanity. Even the &#34;sane&#34; folks were insane. The brilliant thing about it is that, despite it, it was still somehow believable. Very funny film. Although, we could have done without all the bad language.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end. A great story by and about a great American warrior who evolved into a great American coming to the aid of fellow countrymen who sacrificed for their country.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I adore the mystical world of the Old Kingdom - the dreaded Dead creatures and even more unpredictable ones of Free magic, the ritualistic, mysterious Charter magic, and the resourceful inhabitants who live there.<br />This first book in the trilogy* introduces Sabriel, the heir to the title of Abhorsen (the only official, Charter-approved necromancer).<br />She's been raised near the border between the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre, a country where magic doesn't work, but she's far from ignorant of her powers and responsibilities. When a haunting message arrives from her father, she's sent on a headlong quest into the dark heart of the Old Kingdom.  Unraveling old treachery, rescuing a prince, and facing down ancient evils - Sabriel is tested to her very limits.<br /><br />*The next two are about a seer-librarian named Lirael (with her life intersecting with that of Sabriel's family) and I love them even more!

B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love reading Baldacci to start with. He is an easy author to read and once I get started I can't put it down!  Look forward to all his next books!
1451695195|5.0|I am not going into details, but I know for a fact that this type of experiences are  real. I am glad somebody with such a background had it.<br />Raquel
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have heard about this game for some time but had resisted the download until I wanted to find an alternative to Temple Run (a game I never fell in love with). What a pleasant surprise! Great presentation. Tight controls. Sweet music. And that ever elusive \\"secret sauce\\" that compels you to give it \\"just one more go\\". Plus it is a game the kids enjoy as well. Buy the coin doubler to remove the ads and extend your fun with the game. Highly recommended!
B003VW54QO|5.0|The duke at his finest. A wonderful movie that the whole family can enjoy. Although they could have left out Rickies singing.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|Absolutely one of the most influential books I have ever read.  This book will change your perspective on &#34;talent.&#34;  As a soccer coach, I find myself thinking of better ways to coach and this book has unlocked a flow of ideas.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I  am not a book reader but since I started this  I have not been able to stop! Seven the second one an  I am getting ready for the third one tonight!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Consistent with the high quality if BBC shows, this one does not disappoint.  Endearing characters and an engaging plot make it worth watching!
B001HOF8AA|5.0|Wow this girl is a impressive talent the voice is awesome one of the best going around I think plus she is backed by a great band. This album is a Jazz/Blues/Rockabilly mixture but modern and relevant how Imelda doesn't get more attention or recognition is beyond me well worth getting for your collection.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|I loved this movie and I never read the comic I didn't even know there was one. It was fun to see and so highly unbelievable that I enjoyed watching it. I also liked the actors in the movie too.<br />I just love this kind and turn away for a while from the real messed up world we live in. We should all know this is just make believe and only on the screen where it belongs. Well back to our real world on the news, till I slip into an other make believe movie like this or a love one that we'd never would see off the screen. Give the Ghost Rider a chance and don't look for faults, enjoy the fun. It really is unbelievable!!!.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I really like the game but some of the levels are crazy and it seems like you can't get to the next level unless you get some cheats.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|If you love Jane Austin, you will love this series. This is based on her book and it is shown as a miniseries (4-parts). Again, the video quality is excellent from Amazon so you will enjoy without any issues. As I have stated before, if you don't have Amazon Prime, you are missing out.
B00000JNO2|5.0|This is a very underated album that most people forget about as there were no big hits on it but it is full of quality songs, only 2 guitars on this album as Steve Gains hadn't joined yet well worth getting for your collection.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I had seen the first movie of this and I liked it and I liked the actors as well. This was full of action and even some so over board you may wonder why? I on the other hand look for a good movie that I can enjoy and know it's not real and there for just have fun seeing the make believe people in it.  In other words, leave your real world for a while and enjoy a fake one at times. It's violent, yes. but it's only on a screen where Violents should be. I loved it..
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|Cloud Atlas(released Sept/12)contains a plethora of stars,amongst which are,Tom Hanks,Halle Berry,Jim Broadbent,Hugo Weaving,Jim Sturgess,Doona Bae,Ben Whishaw,James D'Arcy,Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant.<br />There are six stories here ranging from the 19th century to the 24th.The first is a doctor whose trip to the South Pacific on behalf of his father convinces him slavery is wrong.The second finds a gay composer teaming up with an old and renowned musician,only to take his own life.The third sees a reporter investigating what will ultimately turn out to be a scandal of collusion between an oil company and a nuclear energy firm.The fourth is about a book publisher who is locked up in a nursing home by his brother,only to escape and write his autobiography.The fifth is in Korea in the future where a restaurant worker is freed and she sees what her societal\\"norms\\"are truly based upon.Can you say\\"Soylent Green\\"? The last vignette is even farther into the future and a poor tribesman with many an inner demon,is assisted by someone from the outside,which leads them both to a better life.<br />It is a grand film full of wishes of grandeur and scope,but I found it's tales of lives affecting future ones,and railing against authority and doing the right thing a little old and stale.It is a film told with different vignettes and these seemingly disparate stories it imparts are ultimately all connected.Many of the actors playing in each one are sometimes unrecognizable at first glance due to heavy makeup.It is a film you really have to stick to,especially in the beginning,as it excruciatingly lumbers along starting one story and jumping to another.As the film progresses the stories become ever that much closer and the jumping's shorter and swifter.But as I say,in the end,all I could do was shrug my shoulders and say:\\"That was it? All that for a LONG 170 minutes or so of my time?\\".<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and it is generally crisp and clear.The colours in many of the stories have been manipulated to produce a stronger and striking contrast while viewing.Extras are one featurette.<br />All in all,if tales of fighting against authority,doing the right thing,all mixed up with a little reincarnation turn your crank,then this one is for you.But I found it's story and story hopping tedious at best and its' length horrifically too long.Not recommended.2-2 1/2 stars.p and clear.The colours in many of the stories have been manipulated to produce a stronger and striking contrast while viewing.Extras are one featurette.<br />All in all,if tales of fighting against authority,doing the right thing,all mixed up with a little reincarnation turn your crank,then this one is for you.But I found it's story and story hopping tedious at best and its' length horrifically too long.Not recommended.2-2 1/2 stars.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|The format of this movie where most of the action appears to occur on stage is simply annoying.  Took a great story and destroyed it.  Don't waste your money on this one.
076781326X|3.0|The Oliver choice was for my children and chosen for the acting of the &#34;dodger&#34; alon with Oliver.  A classic film.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|Anything you ever liked about them is mostly still intact, albeit a bit less of the raw punk angst of their first album. The evolution is clear, but far from a departure. This is just all their styles mixed together in every song, instead of one song at a time. The only new element is that the beat patterns venture farther from the \\"house-eque\\" structures of the first album, and more towards the boom-bap that I think the last album only teased at. All their albums are short though, so the only way to not wear them out is to buy all three, remove CC from your Pandora cue, and shuffle the 3 albums in your iPod. Their are very well suited to this sort of listening. I am sure some people will say this album is overproduced, because that's what they always say when an artist gets major label money, but really, they just need to get over it and let these two evolve how they please. This is not a retread, nor a departure. What more could I want? Nothing, except another album after this one.<br /><br />PS: Don't debate for one second if you should go see them live either. Give them all your money, and then beg for more!
0263234541|4.0|After the bombing tragedy yesterday, I didn't want to go back to the terrorist thriller I was reading. I wanted something light-hearted and easy to digest. This book definitely fit the bill! It was a fairly predictable romance, but an easy and fast read. There are some sex scenes, but nothing too graphic. I'd rate it a Pg-13.<br /><br />My four stars are based on this genre. I would read another book by this author.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|OK you have to read the subtitles - assuming you do not speak French, but a highly enjoyable movie and well worth the read.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I've never been one to get into the apocalyptic zombie genre, but after getting Netflix and seeing that they had the first 2 seasons on there, I thought I'd check the hype. It's incredible how this show grows on you. Some people can't handle the gore, and I get that. My mother hates it! But when I made her sit down to watch season 1 she was hooked. It's a story of survival and human interest. I was intrigued by Lost (until they Lost ME). This is so different. The human elements of how different people react to different situations is compelling. Great acting, great storyline, great suspense, and some humor tossed in. What more could you want. AMC nailed it by taking this project on!
B00B9JDBSO|4.0|This is not two albums in the sense of disc A and disc B, but just in the sense that part of it builds on Silent Shout (and even the Fever Ray album), while the other part of it builds on their soundtrack work. I know critics are unanimous about it, but the classic Star-Wars-cantina-band vibe is sullied a bit, for my tastes, by being wed with such deep near-silence ambient sections. The tribal drum \\"jams\\" are just fine for my palette, and I can tolerate the short odd noise interludes, but a 20 minute track of very low humming tones is distracting. I felt the same way about these kind of decisions on last Chromatics album, which was also greatly informed by side projects and soundtrack work.<br /><br />That being said, I am only taking off one star for these missteps, as they merely add unnecessary bonus content to an otherwise flawless album that could easily warrant this price without the length. I am not hurt by the idea that this may have been a covert way to charge more, in the midst of a supposedly slumping industry.<br /><br />Don't be scared to get this, there is plenty left after you trim the fat.
B000091NII|3.0|If this album did not have &#34;burning down the house&#34; on it, I would definitely not buy it. However, it does have this classic song, so I bought it. There is a heavy use of electronic instruments and the recording is not very good. This particular record was pretty severely warped around the edge which is quite annoying especially since &#34;burning down the house&#34; is the first track! There was some other minor surface noise. There were a couple of other songs which I recognized, but I think you buy this album for &#34;burning down the house.&#34; If you have to have it, then you buy it. If you don't have to have it, then I'd suggest you pass on this one.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is simply brilliant - not quite the performance of My Left Foot but that one is probably unbeatable.  Movie provides a great history lesson of what was going on behind the action of the Civil War.  Well worth the 2 hours plus spent watching it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A little boring at first.  Then all of the sudden-bamn-it is good and you can't put it down.  I would reccomend it as a good read
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|This is a very difficult album to review, so bear with me if I don't nail this. Overall, this does feel like an evolution from his last album, but I can't help feeling that it's a situation where the artist misunderstood the reception and critique of his previous work, which is understandable. Once you reach his level, the only high water mark to set your work against is Michael Jackson. That being said, \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"What Goes Around Comes Back Around\\" are the tracks that I feel like Justin misunderstood the success of. Here he is found both trying to match and exceed the successes of those tracks. After all, why wouldn't he? They are the highest trajectory points he aimed for and nailed 110%.<br /><br />The issue which I think most of us will be debating is the merit of anti-iPod-shuffle song lengths, because certainly Justin is by all means delivering on the promise of his past work, and I very much applaud any efforts to break from the norm and alter the timeline of pop.<br /><br />However, the gamble is clear, and its asking a lot of any pop song to support the weight of being extended over the course of 5-8 minutes. I don't think it's divergent at all to explore the validity of this move. It's clearly at the forefront of the forward-thinking side of this album. Outside the world of pop, this in-theory is so obviously a non-issue, because there are many jazz-inspired sub-genres now, but for Justin it just harkens back to our first fairly unavoidable comparison, Michael Jackson, and specifically Thriller, which was extended to accommodate the short film format, and it made sense to do that while the music video was in it's prime (MJ helped to create that prime).<br /><br />A song like \\"Suit & Tie\\" clearly tethers it's identity to the lounge-music side of jazz, but it's choice as a single seems to have everything to do with the more reasonable length and the Jay-Z feature. It seems to be somewhere in the middle, in terms of dynamics, being neither a low nor a high point on the album; you might say it's \\"safe.\\"<br /><br />The 2nd single, \\"Mirrors,\\" is stronger, if perhaps more forgettable, and thus able to nearly support the weight of it's bloated 8 min run time. The choice to use this song for a short-film type video is more clear. My only hang-up is the central phrase in the hook being voiced in a somewhat N'SYNC style. It's understandable though, and only a minor quip, because the video treatment suits it even better than the position it takes on the album. For my tastes, I prefer the 2nd half of this song when those pop components loosen and becomes more of an art.<br /><br />Other songs feature a stronger front end, where the elements just sort of float around and don't congeal in the extended reprise section. One example is Strawberry Bubblegum; it starts so strong, and there is a complete masterful pop song, before he lets it go into uncharted territory. The drug themes in the first few songs before it paint a picture of what the inspiration might have been in moments like these. I can admire that, to some small degree, as it is a classic idea going back at least as far as Sgt Pepper.<br /><br />When he tries this acid-trip-kicking-in formula on weaker derivative/trite songs like \\"Let the Groove Get In,\\" the results threaten to derail the integrity of a whole album that otherwise clearly trumps his last effort. That would be forgivable if it wasn't the pinnacle of a three song mid-album slump. That's not to say that Spaceship Coupe doesn't stand up strong when it starts, but just to say that Mirrors barely saves the party from the downhill slide that starts in the reprise area of Spaceship Coupe.<br /><br />After this, we are left with Blue Ocean Floor to wrap things up. As hard as I try, I can't shake the notion that Frank Ocean got more accomplished in the first two minutes of \\"Swim Good\\" (from his first album/mixtape) than Justin does in the needless seven minutes of this merely unobtrusive album closer.<br/><br />Before you immediately click \\"not helpful,\\" hear me out: the first five songs of this album, even with the awkward excess of drug references (which don't typically bother me), is basically exactly what I had hoped for. Especially Tunnel Vision and Don't Hold the Wall. These tracks take much more energy to hate than to love, and I LOVE them. Timberland is firing on all pistons with those beats, which breathe with life and morph continuously. The missteps of Suit & Tie and Strawberry Bubblegum are almost entirely forgivable in this area.<br /><br />So, for me this is half an album of progress, mixed with more confused notions about what should happen next in the narrative that began with Cry Me a River, and was very much intensified and expanded on What Goes Around Comes Around, however, the later single holding up to it's extended length seems to have been somewhat of a fluke, in hindsight. That's peculiar, considering that I think we could all easily handle another four minutes of Cry Me a River.<br /><br />This is nearly a solid Justin album, for the most part, with at least half of it being better than his last, but the weak half makes me very grateful that he has already announced another release, and this will not be the final album we are left with as a summary of his career. That is more weight than this bloated collection can carry. I recommend you preview all the tracks, but only purchase the ones that speak to you personally. Maybe you will like them well enough to forgive the rest later./><br />Before you immediately click \\"not helpful,\\" hear me out: the first five songs of this album, even with the awkward excess of drug references (which don't typically bother me), is basically exactly what I had hoped for.

B0001XAPY2|4.0|While this doesn't quite live up to Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, it is a little more understated, and in that way a little more quaint and nice. The only touch of magic is the curse that turns the titular character in an anthropomorphic pig. This curse is less about whimsy (like the magic in Spirited Away) and more about creating an interesting character that wears his flaws on the outside. All in all, it's fun movie about flying, romance, and the romance of flying.
1416955070|4.0|I enjoyed City of Bones quite a bit and loved how fast the story moved. My favorite parts of the book were Isabella, Alec and Magnus (I was quite shocked the book had a gay storyline but it was refreshing for the YA genre). It did have some major downfalls for me though, like the ending!!! The ending is one of the worst I have read in years. I also didn't love Clary or Jace that much in the first book, but I will continue on with it and see if they grow on me. Overall I really enjoyed the read and will be reading the rest of the series but it might take me some time since the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. 4/5 Stars
B009NY43NY|3.0|Warning-Plot Spoilers Follow<br /><br />Ok, given that the book was not what was hoped for regarding the ending.  Granted that what loose ends were tied up was not done in any expected manner.  Agreed, I really could have done without the repetitive cooking and menu planning.  Yes, Eric's less than stellar resolution and departure left a disappointed bad taste in my mouth and empty pang in my heart.  However, realistically, Sookie's adventure was more about finding her place to belong in her world, and her own self acceptance.  She would not have found this within the vampire universe as a human, nor would she have been long term happy with Eric as the situation stood.  While Eric did have a love for Sookie, his character did not undergo a transformation to do so.  It just appealed to him to have Sookie in his world, but he himself remained true to his personality, which was always self serving.  I enjoyed the book, and I am sad to see the end of Sookie, et al.  When I read the last line, I felt empty and under impressed; but I do believe that was the point.  I also think Sam is a good pick for her.  Long term relationships are built on love, true, but you also have to like the person for it to be a truly great love.  Sam and Sookie are cut from the same cloth, from the same world, and have enough shared experiences to truly love and understand each other.  The vampire focus of the whole series was just a metaphor for the internal struggle Sookie's life has always been: a part of everything, but not really belonging to anything. The plot against Sookie by the composition of past enemies was a little convoluted; but really, it is surprising this kind of thing didn't happen more often considering some of the thwarting she has engaged in from the previous books.  So, I agree the end could have been more flash, but the substance rang true. I will miss the series regardless, lackluster ending and all.
0762777931|4.0|Very fun book - easy to follow - great receipes - would recommend it to my friends and family. Not a great read.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I bought this book because of so many great recommendations (even from other writers) and I enjoyed the beginning quite a lot, in the future after several wars against an alien race there is a pervasive militant presence in everyday life for humans. Each child is assessed for military service at a young age and to be chosen is an honor, to fight in the next war. You meet Ender and his two siblings who are exceptionally intelligent and at times ruthless, this sets up a great story and you see the distinct personalities of each grow, all of this is very good, but that seemed to me to be all that develops. You hear about the 'bugs' that are going to come back and attack the hopelessly outnumbered humans and you build that anticipation but it all ends in kind of a different way than you would expect. I am being vague as to not ruin the plot for anyone but I would have liked to have seen a much bigger climax to the story.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|As a fan of Tintin, I enjoyed the movie. Even there were a huge deviation from the original story and book, I still enjoyed it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|you cant go wrong with this, it good for you when you in a long wait line or on a long train ride
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is super fun!!! its slow in the beginning  but  it gets way better the more you play it! This game is one of the addictive  games! As soon as you start playing it the more you play it every day!!!! I really want more games like this!!!! GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We have Angry Birds on every tablet and phone we own. It's addicting and super fun to knock down those smug piggies!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. I normally can't find a good book to read, as I, being the  picky person I am can never find an interesting enough book. But this book was more than interesting, it was moving. I don't normally read a 300+ page book in under 5 hours, but today I did. I shaved my head and raised nearly 3,000 dollars for show my support for cancer research and I did those things  because I really feel for those people who know someone who lost their battle with cancer and the cancer patients themselves. But anyway if you need a romantic and at the same time, moving book to read, or just a book to read that opens your eyes too the world that we live in, this is the book to read. I promise you you will not be disappointed.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It's a great movie and better to have in all formats possible. This pack have it all. And the price was great!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This game is fantastic! Lots of action, amazing graphics, and smooth gameplay and controls! Defiantly worth the 99 cents. A great continuation to the series as well.

B001B7CNXI|5.0|I watch and buy all of his movie.  This movie is one of his best yet. Even though there is another star in the movie there is only one for me.  Miami Vice is action packed all the way through.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat, and wouldn't stop watching even for popcorn.  I am anxiously waiting for another Miami Vice movies.  Hoping they keep the same characters.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|The condition in which I received the product was brand new and had no issues with the movie. I enjoyed the movie and it will be a good choice for my collection I have acquired.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Kind of slow, boring and confusing. There is no character development so, you don't really \\"feel for\\" them. The plot was weak.

B00AFEY354|5.0|When I saw this in theater I did not expect a whole lot from it, but I loved it!  I pre-ordered it and have enjoyed watching it countless times, and all my friends love it too!  Interesting movie with a thoughtful and deep message - very emotionally captivating.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a very nice app to be able to send Tweets from my Kindle Fire tablet from anywhere there's wi-fi.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|This is a great movie, a little slow at times but for sure tragic in every sense. Can not believe there a people like this. Money corrupts and destroys lives.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's a good game. I got it for free using my free coins from Amazon.  It is worth the  money if you don't have coins for it. I can't wait for the next game!
B003QF8E4A|5.0|The movie was very well done with good dialog and cinematography. The characters were well developed but had some very interesting twists involved.<br /><br /> Fantastic Film
B0061S073A|3.0|This is a nice enough app to add things like games and apps to so your child can't accidentally purchase books or movies. The only part I didn't like was you couldn't access purchased content like books or movies in the app...
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Rise Of The Guardians is a excellent family film for all ages that carries a important lesson besides good always beating evil it is best to be yourself and stay true to your heart.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|for a fast game or for deep thought, this game brings it to the table. very playable engine. no frills...
0141040343|3.0|I read the book by persisting to find out what all the fuss was about. It's an OK book, by all means, however it is too dry and lacks the landscape descriptions and the soft elements of relationships. Personally, I like books with more flavor in it. This book doesn't have any of it. I preferred the movie to the book.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Great CD! If you love Rod Stewart then this is a must have to add to your collection. Highly recommend.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Monster Life Kindle Tablet Edition is very fun an engaging that lets you care a bunch of different monster of different elements.  you are supposed to train your monsters to face off against the ultimante evil and save the world.  the more neighbors you have the easier it is to train and battle against enemy monsters. Pairing your monsters element against your emeny so you have the advantage is another thing you need to do.  Elements that are stong against each other:  fire is strong nature,  water is strong against fire, wind is stong against earth light is strong against dark remember these and you will come out victorious in the end
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|I think this book along with &#34;Story Telling&#34; techniques are terrific guides to keep handy.  I read this book over two days and I will definitely use this to help me plan for informational talks in the future.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I really liked this CD.  Great guitar work on the song writing part.  LIke it better than their past CD's.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game gives great instructions and is very simple to play. It is fun and somewhat educational with facts it gives about life in the ocean.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|Good album! It was time for Justin to get back to music. Been gone too long. He & timberland have great chemistry. The only complaint I have is, most, or all of the songs are tooooo long. After listening to it repeatedly, I found myself skipping through all of the songs after I realized each song was playing for a long period of time. I became annoyed, lol. Other than that, great lyrics, great vocal arrangements.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was not going to read this book because  I heard it was only sadness.  I have to say though that the book was funny, depressing, sad, and happy.  I thought it was really well written and would highly recommend it.

0399226907|5.0|I am pregnant with my first baby and I'm doing his crib in Pottery Barn's Hungry Caterpillar bedding.  I bought a few themed toys to go on a shelf in his nursery, and of course I had to get the book as well.  I read the book for the first time and loved it, and even as an adult I couldn't stop laughing at how fat the caterpillar got at the end.  I can't wait to read it to my little boy, my youngest nephew is four and he loves this book so much!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I was addicted to this game, until I conquered all worlds, now I can't figure way I get 2 stars at time and then 1 star the next.

B009UWYFFK|5.0|Great movie ,great for the family I highly recommend , my boys love this movie ,just excellent and funny really really enjoyed it
193700788X|3.0|Meh...after reading all the negative reviews I was sorry I pre-ordered.  After reading, I found that he book is pretty much what I expected.  These books have always had some continuity problems, and they're all pretty light and frothy, albeit fun and quick reads.  I'm not really sure why everyone is so up in arms about this finale. I found this book to be no better or worse than the ones that came before it.  ***SPOILERS*** Eric is a great character, but Sookie can't end up with a vampire.  It just doesn't work unless you're the insipid Bella Swan.  It seemed clear from the past few books (as well as the novella \\"Small Town Wedding\\") that Sookie would end up with Sam.  There's a lot of effort to include almost every character who's ever showed up in any book (but no Bubba!!, almost no Pam!!) whether they advance the story or not, which waters down all of the characters.  It feels a little like the characters had to be pounded into shape to fit the plot, which seems not to have been too carefully constructed. Although an earlier book mentions another child of Eric's, it's not clear introducing the child in this finale actually adds anything to the mix.  I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from: it was fun, could have been more compelling, but not out-of-character for the series. I think this book is worth a read in the interest of completion.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Love Gillian Flynn. The book was great, except I did not like the ending very much. Well I guess that's what makes a book interesting.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift for a friend's daughter she loved it.  Will be looking into getting this for my own daughter!
B00422LESO|4.0|Not terribly well written but a quick, fun, beach read for those of us who can't get enough of Jane Austen.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|A little sappy, but the score is amazing, the characters strong enough, the plausible storyline progresses nicely to the necessary happy ending...and there's Robin Williams.  A chick-flick that guys can thoroughly enjoy - all the more because their gals will love it.
0385344228|5.0|In my experience, most \\"thriller mysteries\\" have a story line that is fun, but in reality borders on the ridiculous. Defending Jacob is extremely well-written and tight, suspenseful...but most importantly, reads like something that you can really see happening.
1463707606|3.0|The book does its job but wasn't happy to see no colored photos of the models inside and not every model is pictured inside which also took me by surprise. When they say don't judge a book by its cover it means exactly that. The cover looks great on this book but could be better.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|This film has it all, drama, comedy, great cars and gorgeous women! A must see! This movie is also based on a true story so you may drop a tear or two!
B00COGXX7A|5.0|THIS WAS A FANTASTIC MOVIE AND I COULD WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LEAST A FEW MORE TIMES.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love this app. Helps me sleep better and longer. Being able to make changes and create my own special mixes was fun. I've even been able to create mix that helps mask my tinnitus! aahhhhh.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I live about 30 mins from Athens. I however didn't discover them until they made it to Sirius. They are amazing! The album is beautiful.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I loathed this character in Something borrowed.  I almost didn't want to read this because I did so much.  I was enjoying her even more demise in the beginning of the book,  but actually ended up glad it all worked out.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book has quite a few controversial reviews. I found it brilliant! The ending is perfect, if you look at the deeper meaning! The book was highly recommended to me, and at first I couldn't say why. But then, as they say, the plot thickened, and I couldn't put it down. Interesting read to say the least!
B0017VG69U|5.0|I have loved Star Trek since I was 12 yrs old and still do. The original holds great nostalgia for me, though I think DS9 is probably the best in many many ways the original characters can't be beat.
0345529057|5.0|these came in an amazing looking case, and in amazing condition. Look forward to reading them all!! So excited! Ya!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son is both a Mine craft and a Lego fan so I bought this for him and it provide with long lasting hours of entertainment.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|Such a great concert! I have a decent concert DVD collection, but this DVD has been played more than all others combined! We could not help watching this over and over again as soon as it came in the mail. This DVD has the best filming quaility of any I've seen. SUCH a great buy!
B00026WU82|5.0|Buy this album for Desolation Row alone and it would be more than worth it.  Truly geat album from best song writer ever.
B001DJLD1M|3.0|I haven't been able to watch the film as although it is in great condition & arrived in a timely manner I am in Australia a region 4 country not 1--When i was purchasing the dvd I couldn't locate a region code so I made an assumption that as I was a registered Australian purchaser that region 4 dvd is what I would be receiving.  I am sure that one day I will get to see what is meant to be a great film.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|UK extra details more fun UK extra bits even more fun  More Maggie Smith while we've still got her  one
B0020BUWX2|5.0|The story is tough but at the same is very easy reading and the author keeps you looking for more. Definitely reading the second part.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Another reviewer said, \\"I've often wondered if Tesla had had a ruthless but devoted manager to keep the wolves at bay, how many more brilliant theories and inventions would he have created?\\"  This book makes you ACHE for Tesla to stop trusting people he shouldn't and open a bank account.  But then he wouldn't have been Tesla.<br /><br />Part of the book is biography, part is armchair psychology--what made him creative? what made him not give up? and part is a not very subtle nudge toward the author's self-help materials.<br /><br />This is OK with me. I have noticed that the free Kindle books are mostly very old and owned by no one (Dracula) or authors of great enthusiasm and not yet much experience hoping we'll notice them.<br /><br />This is not a scholarly biography to set aside a week for, but one will certainly learn more about Tesla than was taught in High School, and the author's thoughts on creativity are worthwhile.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I've always enjoyed his work in supporting roles...it's delightful to see him express the colloquialisms and demeanor of a native to that region. By the by, for those that have never visited, they don't call New Jersey the Garden State for nothing.
1933308087|5.0|The book is very good, a lot of blocks,  there are examples of finished works, good print quality. I am very happy!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I loooove this game so far! I play it everyday which is kinda weird for a teenager, but its so great! The level of difficulty definitely increases as you progress which keeps it interesting. I have heard that I will eventually have to pay with real money, and I must say, I am not looking forward to that. Still, it rocks for now!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|i love everything about castle - its a great show - one of the best on tv - i do recommened to everyone
B0031RS4UM|4.0|An unusual scenario and well researched.Child likes his guns and heads blowing up in a pink mist!! The end comes rapidly.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game well I got it free because on my kindle it was the free app of the day so I got it and  I so love it so I think u should get it it's only a little change but it's great I'm giving it 5 stars
B007AFBYYY|3.0|Story was a little corny.  Filled with arrogance and machismo.  But, beautiful photography.  The scenary alone is worth the purchase to me.  Enjoy!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Not complicated, just a good film with lots of action. The Tom Cruise style. I streamed it off Roku and the quality wasn't bad either.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I read the first chapter, I was so intent on it that I forgot what I was suppose to be doing at the present moment.<br />I kind of disliked the part where Katniss turned to a fire mutt. That is the only confusing part of the book. I didn't really understand.<br />I would recommend this book to watchers of the movie The Hunger Games and fans of the first and second book.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|cool game. pretty neat tees. would get 5 stars if there was a course involved. otherwise nice graphics game play and tees.
B00CC569E2|5.0|I love this cd, every song on it! It is my favorite right now! I love being able to download the cds online the same day they are released!
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you have read The Hunger Games and liked it, you will like this book just as much. Couldn't put it down.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is such an amazing story.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something that is eye opening and makes you really think about life and how we percieve it.  I would have to say this is one of my favorite books.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|A lot like Cultcept , very fun, you will get sucked in.<br />I am surprised there are high quality games like this for kindle fire HD.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Saw it for $20 and thought to myself &#34;what the heck,&#34; and picked it up. I like it more than I thought. Makes tracking shots by hand much easier, especially when paired with the camera's onboard OIS tech, makes for an almost smooth track(which can then be smoothed further in After Effects/Premiere via Warp Stabilizer). One of the added benefits was a shoe mount at the top, which I didn't even realize was there. Very glad about it, too, as my directional mic would not fit under the top handle. Pleasantly surprised on that front.<br /><br />My Canon Vixia HF M300 mounted just fine on the rig. Feels like it support even heavier cameras like DSLRs such as the Panasonic GH2, which would definitely smooth out the shots a little more because of the weight. The screw mount on the underside can move front to back to accommodate a variety of cameras and mounting positions, depending on what you are trying to shoot. Used this for a live event and I have to say I enjoyed using this.
B001C08RHA|4.0|It was a great movie it had many moments of action and suspence to make it a great movie for me and my family.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|And thats what its all about, right?  It's a great story that keeps you entertained beginning to end.  I watched the movie before reading any of the books, so now I understand the criticism of having Cruise play Reacher, but he does a great job at it.  Is he 250 pounds of muscle? No, but he plays the character with all the intelligence and attitude necessary to make up for it.  I'm only six books into the 17 book series and there is already 3 of those that would make kick-ass movies, so I hope we will see a part 2, 3 and 4 or more.
0345529057|5.0|Read these once from the library and loved them, after watching the show I decided to pick up copies to re-read and place on my shelf. If your a fan of the HBO series, high fantasy, or medieval warfare these are definitely worth picking up.
B00BSBY38A|2.0|I couldn't really tell you if the movie was good or bad. The streaming of the video is what made me mad. There were several times when the movie just stopped and for the last half of the movie, it wasn't in HD. According to the Speedstream DSL report, the problem wasn't on my end. I won't rent another film from Amazon, I will wait for Redbox to release it.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|this movie made me cry. The romantic love of two teens carry out through their lives and they find other loves but in the end they find each other and even through thick and thin they still love eachother.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great graphics and smooth game play.  Cut scenes were not too long or cheezy.  Great length.  Will see what happens during replay to see if the puzzles change or if they remain the same.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very good game that makes your brain work! Only complaint is that it was over too quickly, but it definitely left me wanting more!
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Iron Man 3<br />Same Name, not the Same Game.  You see, I love RDJ as Iron Man.  I rated the first Iron Man film a 4.8 out of 5 stars.  It is hands down the best Marvel movie ever made and launched a reboot franchise that is breaking box office records.  Iron Man 2 I downgraded to a 3.8, but it was still very entertaining despite the criticisms.  The Avengers blew my mind and catapulted the viewer score to a 4.5.  But this latest movie in the franchise lacks something the others had:  Character and solid entertainment.  Sure there were great, ground-breaking special effects.  And yes we get to see some really cool ideas and action sequences.  However the characters seemed less important and the soul of the movie was edited out to move along a plot-line that seemed confusing and unoriginal.  With a different director and editor on this film, it didn't fare as well.  Why did Jon Favreau make `Cowboys and Aliens' when he could have made a better Iron Man 3?  Not to say don't see this mind you.  If you like Iron Man, you'll like this film, but you won't love it.  No, it's unfortunately lost most of the charm that the characters demanded of you from the first film.  And the villain was pretty much forgettable and badly written.  I mean, what happened to the Mandarin?  Comic book aficionados should be furious!  So due to the lack of story interest, I give this special effect romp a 3.3/5 stars.  Overall, it's just not as good as the others, but not as bad as most of the other non-marvel action movies that have come along lately.  But if you are gonna see it, do it in the theaters. The home theater will not do this movie justice.  Pros (and saving grace): Pepper and Jarvis.  ~Keep On
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I was spellbound and astonished by the way he grew up and couldn't stop reading until the end, great insights into the orphanages
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A great read.We seem to no longer have guys like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates that dared to adventure the beyond.  The ending was just superb.
193700788X|3.0|Glad it's over. I approve of the person with whom Sookie ends up since this was my pick for her all along--he was the best for her in the long run. So, I'm happy about that aspect but, again like the last 4 books, it was just so contrived and unbelievable and full of unnecessary silly stuff/characters. The series should have ended several book ago, IMO. After the very enjoyable book 8, I never regained the love for this series with which it started.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Although it was initially difficult for me to identify with the main character, I did develop empathy for him as the story unfolded.  What he and the other boys endured was terrible and it amazed me that he was able to love at all.  The story had a certain charm--the setting, the characters--and, though the ending was really not a surprise to me, I would say that I enjoyed it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|SO MUCH FUN AND IT KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION TOO. I LIKE THAT IT ALSO GIVE THE OPTION OF OTHER GAMES TO PLAY
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this is absolutely the best app ive encountered by far. the driving is a bit hard but other than that a pretty solid game
B0001MLMKY|2.0|Would have been OK except did have a &#34;cheap&#34; feel to it and it ticks very loudly.  Would have driven me insane!  Had to return the product.
B0027ZGPDC|3.0|Not the best of the furious series. Sequentially the last of the 6 released. Cool driving thought I felt like the leads story was forced.
0395389496|5.0|This was my favorite childhood book and now I can share it with my God Daughter and read it to her every christmas.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I normally don't like the singing/dancing/competition movies - but this movie breaks the mold. SO FUNNY I was in stitches the entire time - plus the singing is all really high quality. All current music and Anna Kendrick is VERY easy on the eyes.
B00009RGBS|5.0|great movie great plot great actors and of course great entertainment i enjoyed watching it almost as good as the original
B0080M3OGW|5.0|You put two actors like this together and<br />you can expect a five star performance.<br />And that's what you get with this movie.<br />The best part? A happy ending, of course.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Since I did not see a preview or read the description, I had no clue what this movie was about, but I really like Helen Hunt and she always does an amazing job.<br />I was not disappointed. This movie is excellent. The acting of all 3 main characters is superb.
B009GX6600|5.0|I love the whole cast. Together they make the show, the way they interact and have each others backs. All of their personalities make the team great !!! All of their knowledge combined is amazing and I feel the respect and loyalty in every episode. Season 10 was NOT disappointing.
078693123X|5.0|one of the books that got me started on reading ra salvatore was his characters the dark realm series is great
B008BM9L72|1.0|Not my type of book and moreover badly written, keeps on repeating the same phrases over and over again. Very much overrated!
1616550414|5.0|If you buy this book, open it up in secrecy. If you don't, someone will try to steal it from you. You might get injured or be killed.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I love gory murder mysteries with suspense, twists and unexpected turns, the John Sandford genre.  However, when I want to laugh out loud while trying to figure out the whodunit, I come back to Stepanie Plum.  I get murders, fire bombs, sociopaths, sadistic boxers, a hot Italian cop, mysterious black clothed hottie and Glock packing senior citizens.  What else could I hope for?
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Great series. To bad we don't make shows this good in the US any more. One can gleen a lot of history from these veery excellent shows.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|For history lovers a must, well detailed and a great story. Very interesting to learn how the situation was in those days!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Exciting in everyway. I wish there was more in the series. I loved reading about Christian and Anastasia. You really got to know them and felt what they were feeling. Great couple.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was looking for something to read my e-books on the go that I downloaded into my PC  (PC for Kindle).  I was worried that the books I choose to move over (copy) onto my D2-912 Internet Pad (Droid from Big Lots) would not be readable without an internet Wi-Fi connection.  Works without being anywhere near a Wi-Fi signal, just doesnt' &#34;sync&#34; with my collection on my computer at the time.  I am not sure where the few books I moved over from my PC to my Android D2 Pad (9&#34; screen) are stored, as I have looked in there using file manager.  It would be nice to have a default on where to store the books, as I would then select the 16 GB micro SD card I have &#34;mounted&#34; into the Android Pad.  When I am connected to my home interent, it automatically knows where I left of on a book in my PC.  BTW I still run XP so this works with both the Jelly Bean 4.1 kindle and the PC version works well on XP.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|As a big fan of the original which is a campy horror classic I was looking forward to this remake as it seemed to distance itself from other horror remakes. There have been some great horror remakes such as \\"Dawn of the Dead (2004)\\" or \\"The last House on the Left (2009)\\" but none have distanced themselves quite like this one. This film had huge hype around it as it was an outside of Hollywood unpolished remake with the tagline \\"The Most Terrifying Film you will ever experience\\". You have to have guts to make that argument. The directors who took on a big challenge obviously believed in the masterpiece they had created. Most horror film remakes come and go without a whimper, this one certainly did not. As far as I'm concerned the film lived up to its hype. As we were leaving the theater I heard another group of people discussing the movie saying it was as good as it could have been. I completely agree and more.<br /><br />The film itself is beautiful in every way, absolutely outstanding. The acting was excellent. All of the characters exemplified the position they found themselves in and really personified the phrase \\"the fear is real\\" as you actual felt what the characters were feeling. That's what makes this film so terrifying and exciting. I give particular props to Jane Levy for her portrayal of Mia. The scripting, at times, is excellent as it kept all the infamous lines from the original plus some though some of the scripting does feel somewhat awkward and slow opposed to the fast pace of the film. I was greatly disappointed that the \\"They're gonna get you\\" song scene which was in the red band trailer didn't make it into the final cut. Not sure why they would ever cut that scene but rumor has it that it will be restored in the DVD release which I'm looking forward to.<br /><br />The makeup and pratical effects in the film are outstanding (the main high point). It is unheard of to make a horror film with minimal CGI but this film managed to. Certain scenes like the original have intentional over the top gore to almost be comic but other scenes have strategically placed gore and such graphic and detailed effects that it's these scenes that really get to you and make the film so ruthless. The film is intense from start to finish and the cinematography captures that perfectly. Despite having a wide release and huge hype surrounding it this film is NOT for mainstream audiences. It is incredibly detailed and graphic and I can't stress that enough. It is a huge step away from mainstream horror films. Approach with caution.<br /><br />Aside from the outstanding practical effects the other notable high point is the pacing. Both these things make the film. The pacing of the film is ruthless and assaulting and it has been so long since a film was so unforgiving to the audience. The pacing of this film feels like a homage to the 70's classic horror films beyond just the original Evil Dead. The film jumps right in quickly developing the setting and then takes right off. It wastes no time with character development(though it would have been nice if the characters had a little personality) yet we still end up feeling for the characters as they actually care about one another.<br /><br />The criticisms of this movie include that it's \\"pointless gore\\" or \\"isn't like the original\\". I am not sure what to say to the \\"pointless gore\\" as it truly is not. The gore is over the top in parts but this is intentional and other times it has a clear purpose. Again this film is most likely too graphic for average movie goers but that doesn't make it a bad film. Second, what would be the point of remaking a film so that it is identical to the original? To watch the exact same movie over again? This film is a takeoff of the original and pays homage to the original in many ways including many symbols referencing the original.<br /><br />Overall this film is excellent. Go in with an open mind.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Not my type of book and moreover badly written, keeps on repeating the same phrases over and over again. Very much overrated!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Cute for the entire family. Creative. Has a spiritual side to the movie which my family enjoys. I recommend it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I loved this book.  The author's scientific, medical and specifically neurosurgical background lends a new take on the &#34;near death experience&#34;.  Alexander's story is truly an amazing one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a wonderful game! I used the free coins from Amazon to purchase it. It has great graphics and was extremely challenging. I do think I may be a little slower than other reviewers because it took me longer than a couple hours to solve just the first two chapters. The only problem I had with this game is the fact that the hidden notes really were of no help in unlocking the boxes, but maybe the devs will take that in account when creating the next game.
B002NT3B52|4.0|Well written with a fine idea how to look into a dogs mind, if that is possible at all! Defintely a must for dog lovers!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think for June they should make the theme a water park since its going to be summer yay!!!!!!!!!! It will be great for everyone. That's what I think and my friends!.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Definitely a fun pin ball game I love me some star wars and this is definitely worth the 2 bucks to get it
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I was surprised by this movie. It was really, really, good.  Great music, very uplifting, and a feel-good ending.  Compared to the original &#34;darker&#34; version, I think it exceeds it.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Not my type of book and moreover badly written, keeps on repeating the same phrases over and over again. Very much overrated!

B000002KDS|5.0|Killer was the SECOND album that was recorded & released by The Alice Cooper Group, in 1971.  In January & esp.,February 1974, after hearing a lot of talk, from my co-workers, about the two songs, \\"Dead Babies\\" AND \\"Be My Lover\\", I then bought MY copy of the \\"Killer\\" record on Valentine's Day, 1974.  My curiosity really got the best of me & I just had to hear ALL of these songs. This album is rather unique AND really bizarre @ certain times.  I'd like to offer my opinion & review of each song, as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Under My Wheels\\"...This tune is a decent way to begin this album. It has some real powerful jamming & the words are rather comical & times.<br /><br />2.  \\"Be My Lover\\"...A perfect example of a seductive & suggestive kind of song. I really love the danceable beat & the words. Only problem is that it sounds stupid, all of a sudden, when it slows down to an abrupt halt, just before the song ends & it kills the sexy beat, that the song once had.<br /><br />3.  \\"Halo Of Flies\\"...The title of THIS song always cracked me up. This is probably one of the most fascinating & the very BEST song on this album. And it's also my TOP Favorite that's incl., here.  It doesn't have many words, but contains @ least 3 different instrumental themes.<br /><br />4.  \\"Desperado\\"...This is my 2nd TOP Favorite song, on this album.  It isn't the most uplifting song, but it still excellent in my opinion. The strings really add to this real HAUNTING piece. The actual title of \\"Desperado\\" is never mentioned & actually I'm sort of surprised that it's not titled as \\"Killer\\" instead, as IT'S mentioned a lot more often.<br /><br />5.  \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\"...This song also has some powerful jamming & it could put me in mind of \\"Under My Wheels\\", due to it's noisy content...but it's STILL a good song.<br /><br />6.  \\"Yeah Yeah Yeah\\"...I like the lyrics to this strange but COOL song. I also think that there is a drug reference to \\"L S D\\", incl., here on this tune.<br /><br />7.  \\"Dead Babies\\"...This is the song that I could have enjoyed MORE as an instrumental, than w/ the words. It definitely has a morbid subject matter & it's awfully depressing. And to this very day, the Crying Baby sound STILL goes right through me & gives me the chills, every single time. I have always read that this song was intended to convey child abuse.  The music, however, is very good, but this song is my LEAST favorite.<br /><br />8.  \\"Killer\\"...As in the song \\"Halo Of Flies\\", this song has MORE instrumentation than it does vocals. This is one hell of a CREEPY tune & the TITLE of this song is NEVER mentioned.  The music & the Wailing of Condemned Souls in Hell, is very good.  The killer's Last Rites are spoken in Latin as the \\"Kyrie Eleison\\" (Lord Have Mercy), before the death march to the gallows, to be hanged.<br /><br />This was MY 2nd record album, that I ever bought by The Alice Cooper Group. I also bought THIS album in CD format in April 2011. Even though this \\"KILLER\\" album is quite bizarre, it is still very much recommended.
B00BRBIA6C|4.0|Let's get some things out of the way immediately. Agnetha is not aiming to be a dancefloor diva or one to set trends. She knows what she's capable of and has a comfort zone that some might consider safe and a little dated.<br /><br />On \\"A\\" she mines that comfort zone effortlessly and often expertly. I was a huge fan of \\"My Coloring Book\\" largely because it mined how deeply emotional a vocalist Agnetha could be, something not always noticeable on her previous English language solo records. And on songs like \\"The One Who Loves You Now,\\" \\"Past Forever,\\" \\"Bubble\\" and especially the devastatingly good \\"I Was A Flower\\" (my favorite track), there's such a depth of feeling.<br /><br />\\"Dance Your Pain Away\\" is retro fun and I'm also liking the insanely catchy Gary Barlow duet quite a bit. There isn't really a bad song on the CD thanks to Agnetha's vocals, but in this company, \\"Perfume on the Breeze\\" and \\"Back On Your Radio\\" are decidedly and especially lightweight.<br /><br />The CD's already getting criticized in some corners for being too sappy and light, but come on people, Agnetha's not bent on reinventing the wheel. She's made a stately, sometimes elegant and occasionally even moving collection of songs. Welcome back...we've missed you.:)
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|This let me nerd out a little.  No one in my family likes these movies, but for me it didn't disappoint.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Special effects alone do not a good movie make. When adults are acting like pre-teens I lose interest fast. This is not a criticism of the actors but of the writers. I also thought the plot was weak for a movie with such a history behind it. On a side note, I recognize that racial politics are written into many of Hollywood's movies. The constant theme seems to be, White men are cowardly and or evil, and non-Whites are brave and good. Oh, and let's not forget the interracial sex propaganda. It's so predictable!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Lot's of different bingo and slots games - most with an around the world theme. Free credits every day.  Works well on kindle.
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|I am a fan. I was a fan of Firefly, and cannot tell you how much closure this movie brought to the series. However, know that this movie stands on its own. You do NOT have to have seen the television series to follow and enjoy this movie. The world-building is detailed and well done. The actors slip very comfortably into their characters (why not after thirteen episodes on Fox?) and you immediately sense the familial atmosphere of the ship. Lots of memorable scenes and lines. After the blast doors close, trapping River with the Reivers -- when they reopen, it is one of the great still shots of any movie. It certainly is a top ten SF movie. Better ones? Bladerunner. The Time Machine (original version with Rod Taylor). Maybe Stargate. But check it out. If you're a SF fan, you'll enjoy it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Found this and have been addicted to it.  Very nice interface and challenging puzzles. Love the music..Very soothing while working on solving puzzles
1574216988|5.0|Another excellent book, lots of tangles with step outs.  I am always looking though my tangle books for new inspiration, especially this one.  Cute drawings and wonderful ideas.
B00BH41886|5.0|Am a huge ECB fan and this does not disappoint. I have this on cd, but when the vinyl was releases I knew it had to be in my collection. A definite must for any die hard ECB fan.
0307949486|1.0|Poor writing but a good story.  More than a bit didactic.  Read my review on [...]<br /><br />better ways to spend your time
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Columbo was one of the best and most innovative TV shows around. It was fun watching these episodes while waiting for spring to arrive.  Almost have all of them watched. Then I can wait a few years a watch them all again. Especially the episode with Johnny Cash as the guest murderer.<br /><br />Roger Ashton<br />LonesomeRon.com
B00A77II0U|4.0|It was fun. Worth a few bucks just for the ending scene. Puzzles were easy enough to figure out, play it without hints if you can.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Anything McLachlan is great but I especially love this CD. A lot ofher great songs on there. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Sarah McLachlan or great music. Give it a try.
B00138JBB2|5.0|From top to bottom the best and most fun of any Queen album.  They just seemed to have the best time making it.  This album also has a song at the end that wraps of the whole album & I think it is the best song.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Addicting game love to play it<br />I've played it for about a year on my other device when they switch<br />It over to my kindle I'll really will enjoy it
0307408833|5.0|I love this book I'm so excited to try the recipes in it. i originally got it in the library and it woked out great to get it for myself.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|The TED Conferences are exceptional. At every opportunity I expose my friends and family to the site, and my wife and I listen to many of the presentations several times per week.
B000V6583C|5.0|There is nothing bad to say about this album.  I just wish that egos{Axl} & drugs{everyone else} & death wouldn't have hit them so hard.  They got us out of that useless 80s hair band stuff.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I purchased this cd because I love the Night Moves song!<br />the entire cd is great! Brings back a lot of memories.........
B00005AQF6|5.0|This album Is a classic and will always be remembered as one of the best. I heard this as 14 year old and at 30 it still in my top 10 albums off all time
1469220652|5.0|I recommend this series to everyone.  The writing style of surprise and intrigue was just the best.  I was not expecting some of the outcomes and can not wait for the next one, Entwined with you.  Wish she would continue the Eva and Gideon series--Just the very best!!  I love the fact that they both have  dark backgrounds but working toward the light together getting stronger with each other.  Just the best!  My hat is off to Sylvia Day and her writing!
193700788X|4.0|I really liked how this book wrapped up Sookies relationships with all the other characters from the series from Quin to Claude. I feel that Sookie ending up with Sam was the best for Sookie. Sookie came full circle through this series. She started out as an innocent, sheltered girl who's world was totally expanded by the world of the supernatural. It would have been untrue to Sookies true character to end up with a vampire, especially Eric. She recognized all through the series that she would give up many of the things she wanted in life in order to spend her life with a vampire. She wanted marriage and children. She did not want to become a vampire and give up daylight and her \\"normal\\" friends and family. She loved her community more than her supernatural one. Eric would never have been able to give Sookie everything that she wanted. He was too self centered for one, he was too possessive and Sookies best interest was never his concern (for example, he was willing to change her without her consent even though he knew she TOTALLY did not want it). I do believed he loved her to the best of his abilities. In order for Sookie to truly live the life she wanted, Eric had to be completely out of the picture. As a matter of fact, Charlaine ended the series so that all the supernatural beings that influenced Sookie were pretty much out of her life, except for Sam, the one supe who was a part of her life in the beginning.<br /><br />As for Sookie and Sam, truly the best choice for her. He would give her all the things she wanted from life and a relationship and is just supernatural enough to make her life tolerable in terms of her telepathy. The saying goes that best friends make the best lovers and I think in Sookies case, it couldn't be more true!<br /><br />WTG Charlaine for staying true to yourself and Sookie! I appreciate that you didn't give in to the pressure to please the fans by making choices for Sookie that she would not have made for herself!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest Is TOTALLY AWESOME and AMAZING!!!!!<br />I love that you offer a large variety of interest, and never boring or dull!!!
B003O85W44|5.0|This album is a must buy, it has everything you want from a Indie album. The arcade fire do not disappoint you. love it
B00CI5ET7K|4.0|Another example of the great stuff that Joe Satriani can do with the guitar. In one way it's much like his past works but that is alright in this case as it is nice to buy an album and have it deliver what you were hoping for which does not always happen for the better with other artist's. Well worth the money again.
158234082X|5.0|I didn't care for Bourdain before reading the book, but now I have learned to like his shows.  I learned a lot about the culinary business by reading this book.
B0081X8AE6|5.0|This man is amazing! I am so glad that I bought this cd!<br />I will purchase more of his albums!!!
B001Q8FRVC|5.0|You can not go wrong with this album, its the best Offspring album and it shot them to fame for good reason.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Challenging, GREAT pastime, I like to play this game on my commute or before bed. You can play against you're friends on Facebook. Play it pass them and make them fill the blues.
B008602KQI|3.0|I know it's hard to fit everything in from the books, but I mean really, they couldn't even get the color of the cat right???  The movie was &#34;okay&#34;, but really disappointed in how much they missed.  Peeta's charcter I thought was one of the weakest, perhaps poor acting.... Jennifer Lawrence was fabulous.  The movie/story just was so lacking. :(  Since I read the books, of course I will watch all the movies.  I just hope that they get the 2nd and 3rd one right.
1592407889|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book because it gave me an idea of what Shirley MacLaine is really like. I always thought she was a little nutty and now I realize how horrible it must have been being her daughter. I passes this book on to my friend, and give her daughter a lot of praise for coming out and telling the truth about her life. That is not an easy task. Her Dad was just as bad if not worse. How sad...only hope she has a better life now.
B008I34Z8E|5.0|At last there is a new 2012 CD edition of Waka/Jawaka (Zappa Records) and it does not have any of the copious amounts of additional reverb that were added to the older 1995 Ryko CD.<br /><br />The new 2012 issue of Waka/Jawaka CD has been remastered from original analogue tapes, and sounds to me as good as, if not better than the original LP.<br /><br />Running at just over 35 minutes, this is a very listenable album that includes some surprising pedal steel & Hawaiian guitar playing on \\"It Just Might Be A One Shot Deal\\" courtesy of \\"Sneaky\\" Pete Kleinow & Jeff Simmons. Other musicians featured on this album include Aynsley Dunbar (Drums) & George Duke (Keyboards).<br /><br />If you decide to add Waka/Jawaka [Hot Rats 2] to your collection make sure you order the new, improved upgraded 2012 one!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a wonderfully written story.  Enjoyed to so much I had to by the DVD so i could enjoy it many more times.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If you have read the other two books, this one is a must read. A wonderful book that you will not be able to put down.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|As usual this is another of example of the awsome talent of Joe and can,t wait for the new CD with Beth Hart.
B008BDZP3K|5.0|Hot Rats was originally released on a Reprise LP in 1969, and this new 2012 CD (Zappa Records) now gives us a sound as close to the original vinyl one as your are ever likely to get.<br /><br />Musically this killer recording is one of the very best early examples of mainly instrumental Rock/Jazz music, with first class musicianship throughout. Captain Beefheart (vocals) is also featured briefly on one track.<br /><br />* Note > The 2012 edition was REMASTERED from the original 1969 analogue master tapes. All CD reviews written prior to 2012 relate to an earlier REMIXED edition of Hot Rats.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book about Frank and family but I feel the title (in my opinion) was a misguide to the book.  It was really about Frank and his life with his family. Did I not understand what the title represented.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is a must have for anyone that has read the first book. The book shows the power of friends.
B001CNMDUO|5.0|Fun and interesting. Gotta love Statham's neverending supply of miraculously clever and tough machismo coupled with kindness.<br />Enjoyed it all.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a blast. This game has mystery and suspense. Beautiful graphics and creepy sound effects to keep you on edge. I couldn't wait to unlock all the nooks and crannies. Trying to piece it all together. I  CANNOT wait for another one. Loved it! Was a great pleasure.
0709058764|5.0|It's a very good book within a nice history about the mais maker in the past with some info about their jobs.<br />nice chapter about the tools<br />&#34;amazing&#34; chapter about building with a lot of details, picture (very illustrated) and step-by-step of what should do to make a good job.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|The summary does not do this book justice it is an epic read I definitely think that everyone who likes books like the Lord of the rings or harry potter should read this series
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Lovely performances, wonderful topic--always enjoy a mystery being a mystery--and that being o.k.  You get to ride many emotional waves with this one....and still come away feeling hopeful regardless of the challenges of human experience.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I I watched this season in a little over 18 hours! No complaints, highly satisfied! CANNOT wait until the 3rd season!!!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I really love this movie and have referred it to all my friends. In my opinion it's a classic movie.
B00563K3DA|3.0|Interesting with some good shared wisdom but a far cry from Paulo Coelho's Alchemist which it was supposed to be like.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|Surprises and twists enliven this nifty action-packed &#34;gentle&#34; thriller...relatively speaking...Love Blundt's character--strength and hopefulness in the &#34;I'm gonna do it right this time&#34; mom...
B00CBRADU2|4.0|I liked this movie but thought it was lacking something. But hey its Schwartzenegger baby. His last main role was in Terminator 3 Rise of the machines. This movie was not as hard core but still had action and some humor. He may be getting older but he can still kick butt.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I've only been playing a few days but I'm hooked.  I don't care for all the waiting between runs for repairs (unless you spend your ISO8 gems...which don't come easy)  Very fun game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had watched an interview of Dr. Alexander on TV, this is when I decided to purchase his book.  Reading it I was totally absorbed in the entire story.  Beautifully written, an easy read which provides answers to those ready to believe in a beautiful eternal life and the loving magic of the Universe. A must read for all those who want proof that heaven does exist.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Enjoy if you like action, clever twists, and piles of Tom Cruise being cool.  If you get hung up on &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34; issues--this is not the film for you--but what Cruise ever is?
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Very good job. I just hope there will be a season 2. Kevin Bacon does a good job and his character is conflicted. over all an amazing show.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Copper are great in this movie. It gives great insight into bipolar disorders. I would watch this again!
193700788X|4.0|****BEWARE AS THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!****<br /><br />I will openly state I was not of the Eric x Sookie camp. Lets just get that out of the way. I knew full well Eric and Sookie wasn't meant to be (lets not ignore the fact the AUTHOR openly stated they won't be). So the fact Eric leaves Sookie was not a shock, nor anything I would hold against the story. It worked, it made sense how it was played out, and I felt it was a good closure to that portion of Sookie's life.<br /><br />The main reason I read these books was for the characters, and the unique way Harris wrote minor details (what Sookie wore, thought, cookied, etc) made this world all the more real. This continued full on into the last story, and it felt like I was returning home. Even with so much having happened, everytime I pick up a new Sookie book, they all have that same feeling of coming home.<br /><br />As for the plot, it was basic revenge, yes. But it made sense after so long that Sookie would have human enemies, of which are of the most petty in nature. I liked how these issues were wrapped up with a nice, bloody bow, so one wouldn't have to think about 'well what about _____' anymore. Sure, it gave an excuse to have just about everyone come by and see Sookie, even if it felt a bit forced (i.e. Quinn). Though, I had to let it go because this was the last book, and everyone loves to have that one last view of characters they have known for so long.<br /><br />I don't deny the ending was a bit rushed, it still worked. We didn't need to dwell on things as much as before, and for me, I still enjoyed just hearing about those random things Sookie was doing.<br /><br />And to put a nail in it, I see Sam and Sookie being the old couple to make any sense in her life. She can have a good life with him, and he'd be a better person with her. Heck, the tv series established his liking of her immediately, so I took it on reasonable faith that this pairing made sense. I also GREATLY liked Sookie's view oftaking it slow in terms of relationships, something few women in supernatural stories do. So good on you Sookie!<br /><br />Overall, not the absolute best book, but a fitting end to a series I've enjoyed for years. It was fun, enjoyable, and allowed a woman whom had one hell of a rough few years to finally have hope she can just be happy.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I would love 2 give this 5 stars, but the game freezes once every other day, causing me to restart my kindle fire. runs great n smooth beyond that.<br />other than that, absolutely love it. beautiful in appearance, easy 2 play but a great time waster. loved the movie, love collecting the rare fish, n the characters from the movie.<br />2 those that complain about the in-app purchases, be patient, n if u play everyday for a couple mine, its easy 2 rake in 5-10 pearls a week. quit ur belly-achin...<br />overall, loved it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't read a book straight through sense The Hobbit. I just couldn't put it down. I all ready have the 2nd book. This is an extraordinarily Great book.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I was unable to enhjoy this movie, because it kept getting stuck and wouldn't play. I tried several attempts to see the movie but it would not play.  I never got my moneys worth.  I was very disappointed, I had wanted to see this movie since it premiered.It wasn't fair that I paid for a movie that didn't work.
1484913256|4.0|Peter John's twist on a classic ghost story kept me hooked from the first page to the last. The story begins with a nice amount of descriptive details, which give readers a solid introduction of the main character, Ms. May Elizabeth Trump. John allows the readers to travel through a series of comedic moments while drawing the reader closer to the core. Readers will discover there is more than a ghost story; they will enjoy seeing life - and death - from many perspectives.<br /><br />Well before the end of the first chapter I found myself wanting to meet old lady Trump, and if I could have climbed within the pages to help the supporting characters, Penny and Chloe, I would have happily did it. John did an impressive job of maintaining order in his unusual cast - a task that some authors cannot pull off.<br /><br />The setting and plot lines snake their way through the pages. They keep readers guessing with what to anticipate. Even though I am not familiar with the locations, John used his words in a careful manner. Thus, I had no real issues with visualizing his story. I don't wish to spoil it for others - just go buy a copy!<br /><br />I give this story a solid four stars out of five for creativity, plot mastery, character development and delightful twists. The last star was, sadly, not given due to a spray of minor errors. These are common in nearly every author's book; John is certainly not alone. The errors were minor and did not erase my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />I highly advise readers to give him a small bit of time to ensure these don't exist in the final copy, and then rush out to purchase this book! I am thankful for the opportunity to read it for review. I plan to add it to my shopping list and give copies as gifts.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie was riveting.  The young actor was so convincing in the story development.  The ending left you wondering.  Will recommend to everyone.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've just recently started watching Doctor Who after years of hearing some of my other fandom friends talking about it, and I am really sorry I didn't start sooner! I absolutely love it, and have even gotten my three children (ages 11, 9, and 3) watching it too! It's got action, adventure, laughs, history, angst, and love all rolled into one show; what more could you ask for? We're only now starting on season five, and have loved all four seasons equally. I'm already recommending it to some of my close friends, hoping to hook them on the show too.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|The Tom Cruise , &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; movie was excellent.  It had plenty of action and mystery about it .  I watched it several times.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book is packed with suspense. The impulse to read one more chapter is great.  This would be a great vacation choice.
B001B0G5WA|3.0|There were a ton of these reissues and I think they rushed the remaster. Vocals sound a little fried. Compare with the Steve Hoffman version in FLAC.
B00CFQMVLS|3.0|In all honesty, it's an 80's movie set in 2013.  Remember the gimmicky lines and the cheesy dialogue?  Well, here it is, rehashed again.<br /><br />If you're watching this, then you really only came here for the minimal, implausible story, full of holes and explosions.  In all of the Die Hards, this one may not be the worst, but it was nowhere near the best.  I liked it more than the airport one, but less than the 4th of July one.<br /><br />Bottom line, you know what a Die Hard movie is, and if that's what you want here, then you won't leave dissatisfied.  Sadly, you might not actually be satisfied either.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|I went into this movie knowing the book, knowing how the movie was made, knowing the actors and their giftings, and expecting to be blown away.<br />I wasn't.  In fact, I had had enough by the half way point and had to be convinced to stay for the end.<br /><br />The real killer is that Hugh Jackman can't carry a tune.  Since he is the main character, and practically ALL of his lines are sung, this is a major problem.  I found myself almost begging the screen to bring back Javert (Russel Crowe) or Marius (Eddie Redmayne) or Gavroche just to end Jackman's awful vocals and give us some real music.<br /><br />Ideally, in a musical with all the vocals sung live instead of prerecorded, the actors would be both awesome actors and fabulous singers.  And some of them are.  Redmayne puts in a stellar performance as Marius, and Hathaway as Fantine is superb.<br /><br />However, most of the key players are strong at either actor or singing, not both.<br />Jackman is an excellent actor, truly capturing the emotion and the tragedy and the essence of Jean Valjean... until he opens his mouth.<br />Crowe can sing but gives all of his lines with the same deadpan face.  I forgave him the unemotional acting, though, because his character is truly written as an unemotional, dutiful, bulldoggish man who rarely displays any emotion at all.<br />Seyfried as Cossette is a stronger actress than singer, but she can at least carry a tune.  She brings some depth to a character that is written (in the book) to be a superficial, ignorant young woman with a one-track mind.<br />The Thenardier couple completed the ruin that Jackman began.  They are so weird and unbelievable that they are practically caricatures of themselves.  Their role was meant to be comic relief, and I expected at least Helena Bonham Carter to bring the acting I know she's capable of to the role.  To my surprise, her singing far outshone her acting, and it wasn't enough to save the character.<br /><br />Outside of the actors,the screenplay is impressive - it's worth watching the panorama of the greater French drama unfold.  If I hadn't known the book, the quick transition between scenes would have been a bit more difficult to follow, but still doable.<br /><br />This movie is an experiment that almost worked.  But I won't be watching it twice.
1400095204|5.0|It was very interesting to see attitudes change when war actually takes place.  We do so many things during adversity that we would nevery do when things are going well.  This book depicted the changes, fears and disappointments well.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|One of the best romantic , dance movies ever. Story was very compelling.  Too bad today's families are so broken that this story would never stick

B000YAA68C|5.0|Great great great.  Really love Gerard Butler's cute accent.  Cry every time that I watch this.  The story is so different yet would be nice to see this happen to any that have a loss of such a tragic nature.
B003XU02QG|5.0|This was a very well done even though a very bloody movie.  I would not recommend it for small children.  Overall it had a decent story and was entertaining.

0062059963|1.0|This is going to be a tough review for me, be warned.<br />Last summer I read The Selection and I loved it. I thought the whole idea of a story like this was really original. I loved that it was like The Bachelor put into a dystopian book. I saw a lot of positive reviews about it so I figured it would be positive for me too. So I had to read The Elite also of course and I must say (obviously) I'm rather disappointed by it. Actually a whole lot disappointed.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book, more so than some others because The Selection was so good for me. Maybe I had to high hopes but I wanted to enjoy this. The fact that I didn't was a big disappointment because I just wanted this book to be done and over. And that's just never good with any book.<br /><br />I was so frustrated with pretty much everything and every character in The Elite. First of all, America. What was up with her? She kept running back and forth between Maxon and Aspen. It was literally one page she was loving on Maxon and the next she was crawling back to Aspen. Girl, no, just no. The whole book was like this. All about that stupid love triangle. I can like love triangles if they are done well but in this book it has got to be one of the most terrible I've ever read about. And what was up with her decision making? I could hardly follow her train of thought. Doesn't she think at all? At least the one thing that I didn't totally hate was how America was able to read Gregory Illea's diary. What a jackass he was. That's the only thing I want to know more about. Is the diary what the rebels are after or is it something else?<br />I used to love Maxon to bits and pieces but this book ruined him for me. I didn't like him one bit. I guess that The Selection is some sort of game and Maxon has to be sure that he makes the right decision but please, I can't stand the whole thing. Dating all these girls, messing around with him. Ugh! No wonder America got so jealous. And really, Maxon, Celeste? REALLY? The only thing that's not totally awful is that I can sort of understand him a bit, with everything his father (who is a totally pyscho by the way) puts him through he wants distractions but there are other ways. I did feel sorry for what America witnessed at some point...<br />Aspen still is some sort of vague character for me. He wasn't that much in the book but also not totally absent. He did some pretty nice things for America but after what happened to Marlee I can't understand why both him and America would take such huge risks. They are asking to get caught! And no, it doesn't mean that when I'm no longer team Maxon that I'm suddenly team Aspen. I can't pick any teams in this book because they both suck. I'm team America, get the hell out of there and work on yourself, please.<br />The remaining girls in The Selection are definitely on my black list. Especially Kriss. I can't stand her. I get that America messed up and that suddenly Kriss and Maxon got close but it was all so awful to read about. And Celeste, I need her to leave already.<br />There were some rebel attacks again. Wonder what that's about. It's awful but I'd rather read about them attacking the palace and have some action at least than America going back and forth with her two guys. Seriously. But even with the few attacks, we don't know anything.<br />So yeah, frustration everywhere for every character.<br /><br />I was also quite disappointed with the author's writing. And I'm not saying this to bash her or anything. I don't even like giving a book this low a rating because I barely do that. But I couldn't get over it. I didn't like the writing at all. It felt rushed and I can't remember I hated it this much with The Selection. What happened I wondered. I missed action. A lot of them. You'd think because there are rebels, they should've been more of that than there was. Sadly enough it wasn't so. And I really disliked the ending. Literally nothing happened throughout this book. Nothing. I am so disappointed! At least the cover is beautiful and it was a fast read.<br /><br />Overall, The Elite by Kiera Cass was a huge disappointment. Everything from the frustrating characters to the lame plot to the weak writing, it all felt rushed. I wished I had liked it a lot more, but sadly enough I didn't. But I decided I will read the third book once it comes out because I want to know the ending. I hope it won't disappoint me again.ng. I am so disappointed!

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I'm not a kid and I enjoy this game. The music is nice and I am learning a few things. It kind of reminds me of SIM city but it's a reef!

B001JI72AI|5.0|I showed this classic movie in my 6th grade science classroom when we were studying our space unit. Although there were difficulties in the airing (glitches, skips, fuzzy picture) Amazon realized what had happened and refunded the purchase. Once the streaming issue was resolved, the movie played marvelously for the next 24 hours.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is easy to navigate, fast and the free apps to download to phone is great.  Best of all its free.
B001FAFO3W|5.0|This movie is a movie I watched during my childhood, so it brings back many memories. It came very fast and I am very pleased!

B000641D2Y|5.0|always enjoyed this movie.  this product is rated very highly.  good customer service.  i would also recommend home alone 1
B003CFBQBW|3.0|\\"not so great\\" I 100% love the soundtracks to twilight and breaking dawn, but this soundtrack is not as good, its not bad, its just not good.. I hardly remember most of the songs on this soundtrack being in the movie (im sure they are) im just not placing them as easily as i did with music from the other movies. scanning through the disc i found one or two songs that were pretty good, otherwise i was unimpressed.<br /><br />On a side note the musical score from twilight is fantastic, i highly suggest anyone that likes the movies give a listen..
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is the best Alien Anthology. The packing is beautifull, with a lot of extra material. I love it so much.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|like the product, however, it drains ur battery quite abit...<br />i will recommend this product for photoshooting, and to edit thru your gopro setting
B0063IH60K|5.0|Playing this app is fun. Who knew solitaire could be so exciting? Especially the little card dance at the end...whoops, guess I shouldn't have spoiled the surprise!
0061122092|5.0|for the price it offers, this is definitely a good buy. they surpassed my expectations totally. for such a good read, it's definitely worth spending the bucks on it
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This is going to take me a longer time to figure out how to accomplish finishing the games & winning the games. The help pointers are useful, but putting the devices together are my difficult points; then successfully getting to the goal/target & winning the game is another difficult point. I'll get there!
B004XCUEXY|3.0|Eh, It's okay; I guess I was just expecting a bit more.  I don't think it's worth getting the Blu-Ray over the DVD.
B009G78EE2|4.0|I love the trumpet. Brass sound is fun in this. Lyrics are profound. You can understand the words and think afterward.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Lyrics and music seem made to compliment one another. They send me back to older songs with a newer uptake. Can't wait for more!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This selection proves that I am still HOOKED on the Angry Bird series of games. I like the new backgrounds scenes in the games. The challenges to win the games are more difficult. I like the variety of different birds you can use to shoot at the targets.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app a d if you havn't played it soon then play or buy it now!!!! Ps. this the best app in the whole world and space
B004T6IBNY|4.0|If you are looking for a fun game without commitment this is it. It can be quick if you're not too good. It has a computer pinball feel so if you like real pinball you may not love it.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|I thought it was not that fun!  Maybe for  very young children this might be fun but not for me .
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's easy to set up & get to our location. It's instant current weather conditions. The other diagrams are great & usuable for daily day planning. The radar is great & the movement around the surrounding states let's you see what's coming in the next several hours.
1452110581|4.0|The book was entertaining, it reminded me of some cats i know. If you are a cat lover you will enjoy it also.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I love the game but the downlowd just is sllllllllllooooooooooowwwwwww!!!!!it waits charging!(and time) the free game and sonic jump is faster
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I had fun but it was a small challenge to learn in a short time . I will play when I have more time.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|Everything is fine... the delivery time taken is very fast. The storage of the wet wipes is limited. Only that the compartment (the length) is huge. Way too long.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I was trying to download YouTube for free on my Kindle Fire & did this instead. I couldn't figure out how to use it to get videos to watch like on YouTube. I'm not very tech smart. I need things to be done easily in steps, like 1...2...3... I have enough problems with my Kindle without creating more.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Can't beat Robert Downey Jr in his comeback role and even better in Blu Ray. One of his best movies. Special effects are amazing in Blu Ray.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I get sick and tired of the tv weather stations that spend far too much time snowing off their super Doppler radar. This application gives me exactly what I want<br /> No more, no less.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins totally nailed it! This book was awesome, suspenseful, and just over all a great book! I would recommend this book to my friend who likes the movie!
B003QSMC18|5.0|This is mine and my husbands favorite Disney movie.  The characters are adorable, hilarious and so loveable.  The message is also amazing for children.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Just got hooked on Fringe and it is amazing. Kind of like X Files but much better. Highly recommend this series.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is easily the best tv show since LA LAW. Excellent cast and outstanding script. I find myself hanging on every word. Glad I don't have to wait a week between episodes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best and its just a good as minecraft pe but when I bought it it was $6.99
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|One of the most suspenseful shows that I've seen in awhile.  Once you start watching, it is impossible to ignore!  My husband and I love the characters and Kevin Bacon is PERFECT.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was the best book ever I love all the Diary of a wimpy kid books that you Wright you write the best books!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|best thermal paste out there<br />I use to build custom computers for companies and this was the only paste I would use.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn is not Politically Correct which means he can write about the War On Terror as it should be covered; not as presented by the blind apologists in control of Man Caused Disasters reporting.  Despite attempts to placate EVIL with kindness, EVIL continues to exist and will still see kindness as weakness.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so good even more than good it's popular if people like this camels so much it should be free so every one can play it it's not fair to the papal how like but have the demo they don't get to save there worlds
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|OMG guse what I found all 8 pages but It is so scary but if u like scary stuff this Is for !!!YOU!!!
193700788X|1.0|SPOILERS!!<br /><br />Full disclosure: I am an Eric fan. I like Sam.<br /><br />Yes, I wanted for Sookie and Eric to somehow find a way to be together or try to stay together, even if it wasn't a traditional HEA. Early in the series, I thought that Sam would ultimately be Sookie's only logical choice but that thought was extinguished by CH when she failed to show that Sookie carried even a small ember or a flame for Sam. I remember when Sam used to call Sookie \\"cher\\", his own sweet and loving term of endearment for her. That type of sweetness between Sam and Sookie ended early in the series and their relationship is portrayed as that of one between friends.<br /><br />CH has always said that she knew how this series would end. Okay, then why not write toward that end? The story is in Sookie's POV so why not let us read about the love that Sookie feels about Sam and let us read how conflicted she is between that love and her fear of how acting on it could change their friend/boss relationship. The breaking of the blood bond between Sookie and Eric would have been the perfect vehicle to start planting the seed. We could have read how the breaking of the blood bond re-ignited her romantic feelings for Sam now that she's not under the blood bond \\"spell\\". Instead, Sookie's love for Eric is reaffirmed when Sookie herself realizes that she loves Eric all on her own!<br /><br />But then immediately at the end of an epic love affair, we're supposed to believe that Sookie suddenly is happy with Sam or with anyone else, for that matter? Sookie and Sam's love scene lacks love and passion. It's completely unbelievable. Seals sliding against each other? Seriously? Or maybe it was a dead-on explanation of what Sookie was thinking while comparing this to her memories with Eric.<br /><br />The story arcs represented by the previous 12 books do not support the story's ending. Rather than shoe-horn the ending she'd always planned to a story that no longer fit that ending, Ms. Harris could have saved readers a lot of time and money by writing a trilogy, when Sam and Sookie were still believable as a couple.<br /><br />In the end, this Sookie is very different from the girl I met 13 books ago. This Sookie is broken, jaded and has lost her joy of life. She deserved better. The Eric that Charlaine Harris wrote did not deserve the fate that she imparted upon him. After following this story for many years, readers deserved better.<br /><br />I have a feeling that Sookie is going to wake up the next morning, turn to see Sam there, and let out a blood-curdling scream.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a while. It makes you laugh just when you feel you were about to cry. Jamie Foxx makes a very believable cowboy and the star-studded supporting cast is wonderful. The hero saves his wife, and the bag guys definately get it in the end. This has replaced Tombstone as my favorite modern &#34;western&#34;.
B00181JGI2|5.0|This movie is great entertainment any way you look at it, whether you take it at face value or in depth.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I chose this rating because while i love the game the graphics are slow in response to the moves i want to make.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|the 3d on this looks amazing! i saw the movie in 2d, then i decided to buy the bluray and was very happy with the 3d here. if you have any interest in this movie, definitely check out the 3d. it is worth it and makes the movie look even more beautiful
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|The latest tables from Zen Studios are some of their best! Highly recommended for pinball fans and Star Wars fans. If you're both, then that's a double win! I hope Zen releases their other Zen/Pinball FX tables for the Kindle at some point.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was fun and challenging! Beautiful graphics and design soothing music that wasn't at all distracting annnnnd enough frustration to keep coming back from every possible angle. I hope you do another Room...I loved this!
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best sci-fi books I've read in a long time. I would this right up there with the Forever War.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Entertaining game. Some of the HOS were more difficult because of inability to distinguish from dark backgrounds. Glad it was free because I wouldn't have liked to have paid for it.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|Being a lifelong admirer of Placido Domingo I have tried for years to find a Region 4 DVD to replace my old video.  Wonderful music, magnificent singing and beautifully filmed by Zefferelli - what more could you want?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is one of the best. My only issue is that the screen does not rotate. The app is easy to use.
1608871088|5.0|This is an absolutely gorgeous book, and it greatly exceeded my expectations.  I don't usually buy art books, but this movie captured me entirely and I couldn't resist when I saw that there was an art book for it.  It's really interesting to see all the alternate designs for the characters, and the text gave so much additional information on the world and its lore, it really enhanced the experience of the movie for me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|challenging and fun. levels create great eye challenge. great passtime to play on your own.  recommend. you will enjoy this game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really like the aspect of no pop up ads.  It is fun and not crazy hard.  I like it a lot.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|As a veteran, I've occasionally had the opportunity to be around a few teams of special forces and, I can attest to the fact that yes they are full of themselves, with huge egos, and exude an aura of invincibility. Do they let off more steam than most soldiers? Sure, but they've also been through more combat and bad spots than anyone. When in the fight for it all mode, nothing can be better than to know these guys have your back.<br />To all of you, Thank You for Your Service.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game and the price is right.  Addictive and fast paced, better than the first game.  Five star's for sure!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I strongly recommend this movie.  It is fast moving, and for the most part, reflective of recent history.  The product itself is easy to view and good color.
0151003084|5.0|I love this book. It is for anyone with a twisted sense of humor. Strangely, the first time I saw it, the book was displayed in the children's section of a book store. Obviously, whoever set up the display did not read it before making such a macabre work available to children. I hope parents were a little more proactive and no child was traumatized by it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thought that this game was great! Although it was short, it was time well spent. I did get a little tripped up now and then, though. But, there were enough walkthroughs to help me through it.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|The movie is excellent, but the 3D is basically just a really nice HD, not truly 3D. Wish it jumped out at you.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I really enjoyed this show. I wish that season 4 was offered through prime, but I guess I'll have to wait!
B007IK44CK|5.0|Awesome movie full of excitement and action that keeps you interested in what is going on to the very end
B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a  fun and creative Mahjong app. The levels are challenging and creative, but not too difficult for the new players.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|if this is supposed to be a follow up to knocked up and based on the directors life I feel sorry for him. This movie was not funny and was not worth whatever money that was paid to rent it.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Better than any I've tried. More words are required but I don't want to have any more words so I'm done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4 to start!!! Love this series. There is a reason for the high ratings. Storyline is excellent and Maggie Smith is amazing!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app has a lot of fun editing options. Glad I picked this up as a free app of the day. Love it.
B000001EHS|5.0|Great CD!  The playlist of songs is great and it is fun to listen to again and again.  Not disappointed.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie keeps my kids entertained the entire show... my husband and I also enjoy it! A great addition to any family's movie collection!
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It has a wonderful plot that shows how people dealing with life issues can do so with sensitivity and humor.<br /><br />Anyone can see how Jennifer Lawrence received the Best Actress Oscar by watching her performance. Bradley Cooper gave an excellent performance as well; as did the supporting cast.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I know everyone else thoughts it was great but it did not work for me. Maybe a just seemed too twisted for my taste. Read it for my book club group.
B00BESM14U|2.0|I take note of the overall positive reviews for this movie and I would like to point out, that I have watched the movie as a non-American person, so this might explain a couple of things.<br /><br />Although it is quite clear that the movie is set in the 90es it still feels outdated and weird to me, since I can neither relate to it on account of nostalgia nor as a more or less contemporary thing. I'm aware that the story is semi-autobiographical which is part of the problem, since the whole thing feels like the author's attempt to come to terms with his past, which for the general audience is not entirely comprehensible or even interesting.<br /><br />As a movie it works even less than as a novel, since the anticlimactic character of the story makes it utterly predictable. And although the topics of homosexuality, suicide, mental disorders and drugs might still be sensitive or even explosive issues in American society today, to a European public they are more or less every day life.<br /><br />The cast is disappointing as well. Much as I love Ezra Miller's performance in general, as Patrick he fails to find consistancy in his portrait of an openly gay student in a highly prejudiced environment and I thought it incredibly unlikely for him to fall for a cliché football star as unattractive as Johnny Simmons (I'm sorry).<br /><br />As for Emma Watson's portrait of the beautiful and kind Sam, she is beautiful and kind alright, but there is nothing outstanding or original in it.<br /><br />But I'm afraid worst of all in my opinion is Logan Lerman's performance as Charlie. He makes such awkward attempts of being awkward that it comes across like an awkward and botched parody.<br /><br />All in all the movie to me feels like it should have been made two decades earlier where it might even have worked. Miller winning an award for the performance of a gay character that for once is not entirely cliché, comic or tragic, was kind of predictable whereas Watson's honors are completely incomprehensible to me.<br /><br />It's a movie you may watch on a melancholy Good Friday if you're alone at home, have already done your annual tax declaration and don't know what to do with yourself. Other than that, i cannot really recommend it.
6305252572|5.0|What a great comedy team with Nolte and Murphy.<br />My cover for this is a little different than the 1 shown,i have the b&w background city with red and white lettering region 1.<br />Man what a couple of bad muthers Ganz and Billy Bear were,oh and can't forget Luther too.<br />The version that i have has great sound to it,sounds awesome.<br />With my dvd i also got the trailer for this and i rate this movie excellent+<br />My dvd has a silent menu to it and clocks in at 96m.<br />Check out Another 48HRS,also a fast-moving movie,this time with Ganz brother.<br />This is one of my favorite movies,so i recommend this.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It does the job, it has large keypads and does all that I want from a calculator app.  But I am not a heavy user....
193700788X|1.0|First, let me say that I am team Eric/Sookie so this book to me was extremely disappointing.  I have read the entire series so of course I had to read the last book in the series.  The only enjoyable part of the book was reading about some of the Bon Temp characters and what had become of their lives, but even that had a tendency to drag on. Just more money in Charlaine Harris's pocket.  I wish she would have put more thought into this book.
B0013ND30M|5.0|A lot of fun to watch. Beautiful details. This was revolutionary for its time. I would watch it again any time.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Jodie Foster, to me, is just one of those great actresses.  I don't remember how I stumbled across this movie, but it was well worth it.  Engaging.
B006TVQU6C|4.0|Bought this case for an A75-ITX which works great. For a cheap universal case You can't beat it. Great features for the price.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Looked forward to watching it every week.  Though more of Walter and less of Laurel would be nice.  Love Felicity; she's refreshing!
1607066017|4.0|I actually haven't read much of Vaughan's stuff before. A little here and there, but nothing that got me super revved up. This, though, is exactly what I'm looking for. Fast-paced, energetic and fun. Can't wait for volume 2.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|my 2 daughters love it. characters comes unexpected like santa is bald, bunny is thin and not as we usually imagine
B008393Q2O|5.0|It is easy to use and customize to whatever i need. It is better than post it notes or random memos that get lost or destroyed while organizing my daily tasks.
B001TH16DI|5.0|i am a fan of star trek fan. i was waiting for a sale price to get this.  i have other collections
1451695195|5.0|I have already begun my second reading..to catch what I missed the first time....<br />Expect a total change of outlook on the world!
B006H5120E|5.0|im getting the video not only for the love story but i want to see james cameron extra knowing that he is national geographic explorer himself.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have a brother & Sister in law who told me how much they love this show so I came home and found it on Amazon, love love love this show!!!
B00632HWOG|2.0|Something is wrong with my Yahoo Mail.  I can receive emails but cannot send any out.  I need help here folks or I will have to change servers which I don't want to do.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I heard a lot of this book and finally decided to give it a go.  Finished in one day!  Amazing story!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Easy read. Unexpected twist. Would recommend to a friend. Could not put it down. About to read Lee Child's third Jack Teacher book.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Very interesting. Entertaining. Every show I have seen is enjoyable is a good series. Too bad there's only four seasons
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is so much fun!  I can sit back and have my stress released by playing angry birds.  It is challenging, makes you think, give you a feeling of succes when you complete a game.<br /><br />Don't wait.  Get it now and have fun!
B000FC10WU|5.0|She did again. She draws the characters in the story to perfection. I felt like I knew each one although I oculd not figure out who done it. That is typical of A. Christie though! What a great writer!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the Percy and Annabeth moments.i thought that Annabeth really got Arachne good.Leo was great when he saved Frank and Hazel from the eldions and when Hazel and him got the bronze.Percy is my favorite
B000AJIAOO|3.0|But I still like the band and their sound. Some of the songs are a little dreamy (for lack of a better term) and less epic, or metallic for that matter, so if you are turned on to the band by their heavier tracks, you are going to find this entire album isn't filled with them.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This is my favorite of the Percy Jackson series.I can't decide which is better:this one or the Last Olympian.I really think that Riordan does a great job on his books.He has a great imagination.I love his ideas!
B005JCT4B0|5.0|Lots of Pantera, very little money. If you want something collectible, this isn't it. I couldn't detect any issues with the sound and it all comes in little card sleeves perfect for ripping and storing away without taking up any space.
B004AM5QT4|5.0|Follett's  writing never fails to thrill.  Enough twists and nail biting moments to make this a can't-put-it-down favorite.  A mystery to keep you up way past your bedtime!
B000002HJR|4.0|I think they have a closer-to-Pantera sound than Anselmo's other projects and I just like the Southern Metal sound. It's old news at this point so I'd say that pretty well sums it up.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Easy to use<br />Good, accurate information<br />Trusted, well known app<br />Current information and up to date weather<br />Severe weather warnings
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Man I just started watching this show and couldn't wait to see season 3<br />Thanks for having it. worked right thru my blu ray
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I don't know why this movie didn't do well at the box office.  I thought it was hilarious, and something we could watch as adults without getting embarrassed with my adult children.  I wish Hollywood would make more movies like this
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've read at lot of extraordinary book in my life. But I could accurately describe those books using singular adjectives and nouns and attempt to express my pleasure. But I couldn't fathom doing so with this book. I suppose I couldn't ever sum it up  to be \\"exceptional\\" or \\"truly amazing\\" as my title suggests. Be cause if I could, I would have done a horrendous disservice to John Green 's work. The only thing I could say and have the ability to be the least bit accurate was that I wish I owned it in hardback.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|This movie was dumb, and of course, had to have the necessary violent scenes for their male audience.  Glad we didn't waste money at the movie theater for this one.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|Good movie.  It was fun watching it again.  A little over acting, but what do you do when you are quoting Klingon.
0440244412|5.0|Karen Marie Moning's Fever series books are so full of excitement and you never know what will happen next.  I have read all of them now and wish there were more!
B00008NRI7|5.0|I don't know why I like this movie so much. It is such a simple film, but it is adorable.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|It is an adorable family movie, I have yet to meet someone who didn't enjoy it on some level or another.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Sing to me boo! Make me feel special! He knows all the right words, just listen closely and youll fall in love.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Ok, so this was the first year men wanted to see movies about stuffed animals and women were willing to go see strippers in action, but it was so worth it! I purchased one of these movies for my mother and sister, and was pleased when my sister-in-law purchased one for me! Definitely a ladies night in movie.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|So prefect, feels like he made the song &#34;When I was your man&#34;- trust me when I say this.... It was written for my ex, its everything he should have done and didnt.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|Overall the packaging was in great condition and the set looked good. Season 2 and 3 had some episodes that just wouldn't play due to the damaged disc.
1419705849|4.0|my son likes it, he has been wanting it for a while.  he tried the library but was always checked out
1616550414|5.0|This book has all you will ever want to know about The Legend of Zelda lore, background, timelines, and character descriptions.  Lots of great illustrations and information spanning the entire series.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Had to have this for my library.  Product arrived quickly and now i am enjoying this movie when i want to see it.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Didn't realize how the ENTIRE plot of the movie was sung.<br />Whoops.<br />Although the acting was awesome.<br />I guess musicals aren't for everyone.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Had to have this for my library.  Product arrived quickly and now i am enjoying this movie when i want to see it.

B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Nobody thought Deep Purple would be giving us anything but hits packages by now, but out of nowhere they come out with a great new CD. Not just good, but GREAT. While there is no Smoke on the Water here, this whole CD is Deep Purple goodness, including majestic organ riffs (even though Jon Lord is no longer with  us), memorable hooks, guitar riffs, and serviceable vocals.<br /><br />Two of the 11 songs are over 6:00 in length, four are over 5:00, the rest over 4:00; there are no attempts at hit singles, which is great since no one wants to hear a \\"single wannabe\\" from Deep Purple. They do what they've always done, rock out. I've always felt Deep Purple was underrated, they never seem to get the same level of respect as Black Sabbath for example, and they're every bit as good and influential.<br /><br />While I admit that I bought this on a whim, ready to laugh it right off my iPod, the joke's on me. This CD is on repeat play, the truest test of a good album.
B000UUF69A|5.0|My son and I watch this movie over and over again. Even my seventeen year old loves this turtle movie. It's a great family film and has a really good message if that's what you're looking for, if not, then it's great fun.
1400069807|3.0|If you've been paying attention to what goes in your mouth, or have read anything on nutrition or diets, little in this book will surprise you. Michael Pollen, Mark Bittman, and many others have covered this territory before, and probably better (the writing is not that great). But Moss has done some interesting research to add a few more layers to the pile. The message is basically, corporations don't care about your health, your family, or your wallet. They'll wring whatever they can out of you and do almost anything to wring a bit more.<br /><br />If you're looking for hope or answers, you won't really find them here--there aren't realistic solutions given, and the corporations have way more time, money, resources, and wits than the average person.<br /><br />This isn't a bad book, it's just others have laid out the same things more concisely. But I think/hope that the more people read about what goes into our \\"food\\", the more they'll care and try to change.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book is so different than the movie that I'm not even sure they should have the same name. And for once I'm going to say that I like the movie more than the book. Although I have given the book 4 stars, so I did like it as well. It's a bit darker than the movie for sure. So, if you're looking for a replica of the movie, this isn't it for you. But if you're just looking for a good book, then you'll like this one.

B0012NO316|5.0|I remember reading a while back that Bette Davis was in the running to portray blowsy, bitter Martha because the mid 1960's Elizabeth Taylor was considered too young and beautiful for the role. And while I admit I would have been fascinated to have seen what Davis could have done with this part(absolutely LOVED her)I have to also say that Liz Taylor seems predestined for Martha, just as Richard Burton was for George. This dark, disturbing, supremely witty classic showcases Burton/Taylor at their absolute A game BEST. It's possible at times to forget you are watching actors act...not a real life middle aged couple taking an emotional pick-axe to their marriage and to one another. The only other time in my life that I have actually forgotten I was watching an actor at his craft was when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis portray Abraham Lincoln recently. The fact that Richard Burton didn't not win the Best Actor Oscar that year annoys me to this day.<br /><br />I own this on DVD-it's one of my Top Five all time favorite films-and I pull it out every now and then to marvel, gasp and giggle yet again...sometimes all at once. Every single performance is brilliant including George Segal and Sandy Dennis as George and Martha's unfortunate cocktail party guests.<br /><br />Acting NIRVANA.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|I did not go see this in the theaters because of all of the hype.  I have been disappointed many time by what was supposed to be a &#34;great&#34; movie.  The acting was excellent. Very well written story. Special effects were fantastic.<br />I know some people complain about the children participating in the &#34;game&#34;.  I think if the story was about young adults it would not have been as good.  It is the shock and horror of the government forcing these children to participate in the game makes the drama needed.  Otherwise it would be just another action movie.
B003V6L94Q|4.0|I purchased this CD because of two songs on it, they are beautiful.  I was not familiar with a couple of the songs and didn't care for them; however Zac Brown Band always presents with outstanding harmony.
B000LJ9ZWE|4.0|Westworld is one of those films from the 70's that you must see.  I love looking back to see what they thought the future was going to be. Cinematography was very good and it has a good story line. Yul Brynner was excellent as a gun slinging robot. I am sure the &#34;Terminator&#34; was based on his performance.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book. The lead character is very different than most of the other females you see leading other young adult novels, which I see as a major plus. She's very independent, strong and at times can seem cold but throughout the book you see her figuring out who she is and you learn by her actions how kind she is. As other reviews say, there are sexual situations and the main character is very against marriage in this book, but after reading it myself I feel it's more in context of the story, in times where women were meant as more or less slaves to their kings or lords and such, and the character feels that to marry even a man she may love is to surrender her own free will. The sexual parts are not described in any sort of detail, only implied. It's still a great book, one of the best I've read recently and I plan to start the next soon.

B00BQI4AU6|4.0|By Jim Clark, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />I was excited when my friend, Amanda Cagan, at ABC Public Relations emailed me Tom Keifer's debut CD, The Way Life Goes, was about to release.<br />Tom was the vocalist for the hard rockers, Cinderella.<br />Cinderella was riding high during their second CD, Heartbreak Station, with songs like \\"The More Things Change,\\" and \\"Shelter Me,\\" charting.<br />That same year Tom lost his voice. To complicate matters more, his mother died. The band, which were discovered by Jon Bon Jovi, broke up in 1995.<br />They did have a reunion tour in 2006, with fellow hard rockers Winger and Poison. I was lucky to catch them live in Tupelo, with my friend, Dwayne Blackmon. It was quite a show.<br />They planned to tour again in 2008, but Tom's left vocal cord hemorrhaged again. The future seemed uncertain.<br />Next thing I knew Tom was touring solo beginning the first of May, 2013. The record The Way Life Goes had it's beginnings in 2003, with few knowing.<br />\\"From the beginning, the attitude was, `Let's have fun and just make a great record and it'll be done when it's done.' Little did we know it'd be nine years later... it's done and we went through some crazy stuff and mixed and remixed and reworked things over and over and probably made a lot of mistakes along the way, but finally got it where we were all happy with it, so here it is,\\" Tom said.<br />This is one of the most powerful rockin' CDs to come across my desk in a long, long time. It's clear that Tom had a lot of emotions to put into music, including his love for his wife, and sometimes writing partner, Savannah.<br />Don't miss this one.

B00C1LIYWM|4.0|By Jim Clark, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br />Safe Haven is classified as an American romance film. It is certainly that. It was based on a novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. Nicholas also penned The Notebook, Dear John and The Lucky One. It is also a drama, mixed with laughs, some thrills and intense character study.<br />Katie  (Julianne Hough) leaves Boston abruptly for the small coastal community of Southport, North Carolina. She is fleeing from her abusive husband, who she thinks she may have killed in a massive fight before she took off.<br />Her husband, Kevin Tierney (David Lyons) is a Boston cop, very much alive and intent in finding his spouse.<br />Katie attempts to live quietly but sparks a friendship with Alex Wheatley (Josh Duhamel) the manager of a local convenience store. He is a single dad, trying to raise a daughter and son. He lost his wife to cancer a few years ago.<br />The girl Lexie (Mimi Kirkland) loves the idea of having Katie around, the son Josh (Noah Lomax) not so much. This was Kirkland's big screen debut. The eight-year-old is a wonderful little actress, and one we'll certainly see more of.<br />Safe Haven is reminiscent of Sleeping with the Enemy, so if you liked that, you'll love this.<br />It was filmed primarily in Wilmington and Southport, North Carolina, with bits done in Louisiana.<br />It's a film you can feel good about renting or buying. Sparks and his wife had donated \\"close to $10 million\\" to start a Christian, international, college-prep private school, The Epiphany School, which emphasizes travel and lifelong learning.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|Enjoying the games but sometimes a sale would pop up and it wouldn't be available. Screen would freeze up while trying to collect coins and Apple's. Also the screen would slide up to the top and would get stuck and I'd have to shut it down. Many times I have &quot;lost&quot; all my friends and sometimes they'd come back and with the latest update to Dino world I've had to re invite all my friends I had 20 now I only have about 4.

B004XZR63M|5.0|I'd highly recommend this book to anyone. I've read it to my kids. I've made my first real estate investment and changed the ROI goals of a few friends who have done the same. The wisdom shared makes me do the right research to make confident decisions. I'm working on a few more passive income steams and have experience in all 4 quadrants. And the best part is - I'm an artist.

1400069742|5.0|Another great history by Olson.  It is interesting that some of the fictional works of W.E.B Griffin also tell the same tale, but I didn't believe it until I read Olson. We all knew that Lindbergh was a fake hero - a clever mechanic who was skillful enough and lucky enough to make the first single-handed flight from the US to Paris (obviously for the $25,000 prize)  - and crossing the Atlantic non-stop had already been done from Newfoundland to Ireland by two Brits, Alcock and Brown - no pun intended). The enmity between Roosevelt and Lindbergh was not as detailed in Griffin. Lindbergh, a rigid thinker,  was not mentally equipped to deal in international politics and his admiration for the Nazis, the receipt of a medal from Goering, and  the insistence of his view, even when Hitler was obviously the bad guy of Europe, all lowered his international esteem.  Lindbergh was regarded  as an extreme Nazi sympathizer, along with the Duke of Windsor and Wallis, the last two  would have been captured and suborned in Lisbon by the Nazis had it not been for MI-6.     Where Lindbergh finally did give yoeman service was, as a civilian, in the the improvement of the the range and fuel consumption P-38 (and, it is said, some operational missions in the Pacific, including one Japanese  plane shot down.)  Apparently, along with Juan Trippe, Lindbergh never regained his reputation nor was he forgiven by Roosevelt.  Also illuminating is that Roosevelt's hesitancy to enter the war was based on his enmity with certain members of Congress, despite the rising demand from the  people to help Britain by action, a situation that was radically changed by Pearl Harbor when Hitler also declared war on  the US (not the reverse at first).  Had Hitler not done that Olson believes it is possible that the US would have limited its activities to the Pacific, a bitter and hard-fought war, but not the main scene in  terms of threat to international peace and freedom.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This latest by Kathy Reichs keeps you guessing at what the final outcome will be. Intelligent reading, for intelligent minds.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|So I decided to read this after Tom Cruises &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; movie.<br /><br />The book seemed to have some lofty goals, but I found the book very carrot leading the horse style which was boring.  I will say that Lee Child seems to mature the story line as the series progresses (so I have read.)  I guess I may try the second Jack Reacher story when I am out of other books to read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I am about 1/2 way through the book and I am really enjoying it.  A definite read for others!!! A good book club choice.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|An unabashed hate letter to the sales industry.  I loved it.  Glengarry Glen Ross shows a lot of the dirty tricks, chest-thumping, cut-throat attitude, and despondency beneath the salesman's toothy veneer.  Great dialogue, too.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is the best and most awesomest game to play. You can fight Mon t ers at night and create incredible designs. In creative mode you have all the blocks and cannot die. In survival u get to have an adventure but you start with nothing at all and there are monsters at night if you want to fight and have fun. Overall THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER
B00992CF6W|5.0|Game is awesome. I would like to play multiplayer with people but my wifi doesn't work for me. Overall the game is amazing. I have build a underground house, a floating storage room, and a castle . You should buy this game. Its really fun.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful story. There is suspense, intrigue, romance, in a story that captures you from the beginning to the very end.  It is a love story, not a sex story.

B000R7HY0K|5.0|The beginning of the movie is rife with suitably gruesome gore and plenty of &#34;exploitation&#34;.  A good set-up for the second half, featuring the incredible Zoe Bell, adorable and extremely talented. The best part is, of course, that the girls win the day. Kurt Russel is great as the psycotic stuntman/murderer who gets his in the end.
1742200508|4.0|Maybe some folks will not see the point of putting photos in a travel guide since they are going there in person. But to me photos make the book (and the place) seem much more exciting, plus really help me decide which specific sites or sights to visit. While this book seems really great in other respects, it sure is lacking in photos.<br /><br />Also, if you plan to bicycle around England, which seems pretty appealing to me, I'd get a different book at least for to actually carry on your trip. This book has very little info specifically tuned for cyclists, and as good as it might be otherwise you probably don't want to carry along two books on such a trip.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What an excellent book! First of all, it is told from the vantage point of the dog, which in itself was enough for me to want to read it.  The story itself is so unique, heart-wrenching, well-written, and beautiful that I found that I couldn’t put the book down.

B005LAIHSG|2.0|Whoever cast Kristen Stewart (who I loved in the Twilight series) in this movie must have been having a bad day.  Hardly the &#34;fairest in the land&#34; (as she was photographed darkly) compared to the Queen (photographed with filters). The dialogue was horrible (who in that fairy tale time frame says, &#34;Hey, it's okay&#34;?????).  Character development was awful.  Charlise Theron's screeching angry voice was laughable and Chris Hemsworth's character was boring.  The only good thing about the movie was the special effects.  I'm sorry I paid money for this rather than renting or borrowing.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|We all enjoyed the movie and shared it with three grandchildren! Great experience for us all. The price was right also.
B008BM9L72|1.0|The content of the book was  too much for me, didn't even finish reading it. Very sado-maso, not a tender and sexual book as I thought it would be. Don`t understand all the hype about it....
B00190N4E4|5.0|This movie is a must see !! I remember this movie as a youth and never really appreciated the full scope of what Gandhi did. What courage he had to push anger and hatred aside .Gandhi teaches us all that there is no weakness to saying no to violence and finding strength in our our hearts to say yes to freedom from it.Ben Kingsley is a true marksman of acting  the role of Gandhi .You felt like you knew Gandhi as he lived loved and taught peace without condition  or retribution for those who beat him down along the journey .An eye for eye will make the world blind.

B005OAQE4M|5.0|Doris Goodwin is an amazing writer and artfully conveys the reader into the lives of Lincoln and those associated with him.  This book brings Abraham Lincoln to life in a new and interesting way.  The writer brings Lincoln's personality to life and gives the reader a close-up view of those around him.  Reading this book is a delightful way to learn history and find out more about a president who was determined, thoughtful, magnanimous and forgiving.  This is a book well worth reading.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Movie was so so. Jame Fox was wrong casting. It's hard to take him seriously. Overall, the movie was not engaging to me.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|Loved, Loved, Loved the last 1/3 of the book. The first 1/3 though I had trouble getting through, I get the spiritual staging, but I swear I thought the first 87 pages felt more like 200. Once the boat sinks things pick up and the story is amazing from there on for me.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|They did not sacrifice the acting for the sake of the music.  I think this is the finest musical ever filmed, and the finest version of Les Miserables whether stage or screen.<br /><br />And while people are given to believe this is a story about social justice (there is some aspect of that), the reality is that this is a story of transforming love and redemption.  I think this is what God's redeeming power does to a person when they yield to His will.
0061950726|4.0|I loved this book. I loved Ms. Kline's writing style, her descriptions, her imagery, and the story she told. I loved that it was fiction and yet I learned so much. I had absolutely no idea that the orphan trains existed, so it was interesting to see the pictures and read the info. at the back of the book. The characters were so real and full of life. There are several \\"f\\" words, along with other language, domestic violence, abuse, and an attempted rape scene. Although it may be difficult to read in places, because of the hard life they lived, I was so glad I read it. I highly recommend this book for college-age and up. It may be too much for even an 18 year old. You may read my full review on my book blog: [...]
1439156816|5.0|Stephen King gives a look into his personal life and background before launching into tips and inspiration for novel writers. It is one of the best books for novelists I've ever encountered. It's lively and well written, and there's something for writers new to the trade or those with long experience. It's not a new book, but there's a reason it stays in print.
1432794426|5.0|This book is brilliantly written and reveals so much about MJ's everyday life and the way he interacted with those around him. It reveals how he was hounded by the media and people eager to extort money from him. A man who gave so much to the world with his beautiful voice, dancing, genuine concern for the world and those in need. He gave so much to all, not just money, but himself. How he was repaid for that was death. Stories about his children show what a wonderful father he was. A bright star now shining from above. Non-believers of MJ should give this book a chance and would learn so much. As an MJ fan my belief in him is greater than I ever thought it could be. Thank you Karen for your research and presentation of the facts, written from the heart this was a story that needed telling for Michael and you did it. God bless you. MJ's legacy will live forever.

B009NY43NY|2.0|For this to be the last book in the series,  I was a really let down. Some of the other books were also exciting I couldn't wait to read the next one. This was kinda boring, I'm mean of course it was good but not exciting. There were hardly any vamps in the book her and Eric just broke up, and.....nothing. could have been better but that's just my opinion.

B0012QRPU4|5.0|This show is BAD A** The writing is genius. I am always in shock at the end of every episode wondering how Walt will get out of this one. Love this show!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I haven't read this book (but gave it a five star for the sake of optimism); I've been meaning to read it since I am very interested in the topic, but I wanted to see some of the reviews of the work first before I made the purchase. I've read the book, &#34;Heaven is For Real,&#34; and was thoroughly disappointed since it seemed that the little boy had not had much of an experience to speak of, and after I read that his father (who just happened to be a Christian minister) helped manufacture his story, I was more than a bit skeptical. I'm not religious as in the sense of being a believer in a &#34;God Almighty&#34; (as I was taught to believe when I was an uncivilized Indian boy from the reservation that was going to be saved by Catholicism, which was the predominant missionizing christian religion in my part of the world). Having decolonized from that horrendous, humiliating colonizing experience of the christian God, the Devil, Heaven, and Hell, and church on sundays, I've made my way slowly back to my own tribal religious (spiritual) roots. Anyway...the point of my review is that I'm wondering if any white or non-Indigenous folks that have had a NDE have ever encountered my non-Christian Indigenous relatives/ancestors in your heaven? And, has anyone seen Christopher Columbus in heaven? He was responsible for the bloody, savage, mass murder, rape, and genocide of Indigenous Peoples in the Caribbean, shortly after 1492. After this unparalleled, unmatched spree of murder, on his deathbed he asked for forgiveness from the christian god and commended his spirit in his hands. If I had a NDE would I see him in heaven?
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is really good. I would recommend this book because there is amazing things that happen that I could never write. That is how good it is!!!
B0060AY85C|5.0|what a good novel.  i enjoyed how this was a novel that dealt with the soul of the main character and his struggles.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Could not put it down! Was a page turner and it made me question the lengths I would go to for a loved one.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I don't like earbuds, so I always get these headphones. You can't beat the sound, it's great.<br />They are really comfortable, you don't even know you're wearing them.<br /><br />the only reason I didn't rate them with 5 stars is because one side always seems to eventually go out for no apparent reason. For the price, I just go ahead and order a new pair, but it would be great if Sony would just make them a little more durable.
B005OK721G|5.0|a friend of mine recommended i get this dvd and i'm very happy that i did. i like action movies and i watched this one 4 times already.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I grew up listening to Rod sing &#34;Maggie Mae&#34; and all his other awesome songs, but I never dreamed that he could amaze me all over again with this new album! All I can say is &#34;WOW&#34; He has rediscovered his voice after 20 years and he does not disappoint at all! From the 1st song to the last song this album is classic Rod! My favorites are &#34;Live the Life You Love&#34; and &#34;Sexual Religion&#34; but the ballads are wonderful too! I think I have played the CD at least 6 times over and I know I will never get tired of it! I urge all Rod Stewart fans out there to go out and buy it and listen to what he has done! At 68 this classic rocker has still got it! I just hope one day I actually get to see him in concert!
B000004756|5.0|These three masters played together in SF earlier, but that concert felt to me like a testosterone fest. You had to have been there...<br /><br />This album is quieter, intimate, it captures the depth of their expression, what made them famous as individuals.  Here, they are not trying to raise the bar on technique, speed and acuity, but feels more like they just gathered to tell their version of life, share the poetry of their soul.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|I happen to love stories from antiquity but I think that most people would enjoy this film even if they aren't especially fond of the ancient world!

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Once I finished this book, I felt a great sense of relief, satisfaction and slight regret that such an amazing series had finally concluded. Mr Sanderson did great justice to Robert Jordan and wrote his vision with perfect words. Thank you both
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|When I heard I Will Wait I loved the song.  the rest of this album is not disappointing!  Fun and catchy
B00991TCOG|5.0|I know it sounds weird...dub step violin?  A dance beat with original violin lines.  Not classical, not bluegrass but something that you will love to tap your foot to.  And if you thinks she plays well, be sure to check out her dancing on youtube.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Pretty awesome game. A little difficult at first but starting to get the hang of it. I really like playing it and it matches the new movies which is pretty good. Get a new voice for Iron Man/Tony Stark because it doesn't sound like him at all!!!

193700788X|1.0|Don't waste your time reading this as the author clearly did not waste any of hers actually trying to write a cohesive and interesting end to her series.<br /><br />Lame southern euphemisms abound along with boring descriptions of the mundane aspects of Sookie's day to day life (I could care less about her tan or her cooking dinner or going to Wal-Mart). Analogies are lame and it's fairly apparent that Ms. Harris hasn't really researched Louisiana and it's views of the world. As a born and raised Louisianian myself, I find it really hard to view Louisiana as the first state in the union to do anything supporting supernatural rights (especially since we can't seem to vote to support gay rights or abortion and seem to spend so much time battling archaic ideas about race and gender roles). Even from a fictional stand point I have to scoff. I would be hard pressed to believe she has studied anything about this state other than weather patterns and tourist sites about major cities. The southern phrases she seems to like to turn are so sickly sweet and vapid that they turn my stomach. I audibly groaned throughout this entire \\"book.\\"<br /><br />Everything seems to get tidied up in the easiest and most predictable way, which I expected (after all it's not like this is a complex series, it's light and easy reading and nothing more complex than that). However, a little effort would have been nice. The entire premise of this book could have been inserted as a chapter in the last book or even the book before that and wrapped up with more substance. Characters that have already been made the bad guys are brought back to be the bad guys once again. The entire manner of this comes off more as if it would have been too much work to develop anything else instead of the common writing habit of wrapping things up full circle.<br /><br />I give one star for the likeable characters like Sam, Diantha, and Pam who stayed consistent throughout the series. Sookie started out with promise and I don't discount her entirely, but the author seems to be more focused on keeping Sookie pretty and likeable and the weak way in which those points are written have the exact opposite effect on me.<br /><br />My opinions are based entirely on the book series, by the way. I haven't watched the t.v. show past the first season.

B000FCKC4C|2.0|This book has been a complete joke for me. Unlike other people who say that this is one of the most inspiring book, etc2, what I see is actually a story of absurdity. I have to agree, to some point, that there is little wisdom here and there. Of course you should follow your dreams, but to believe in omens as a guide, or that if you really want to realize your dream then the world will conspire to help you, is simply nonsense. I disagree that if people say this book is about wisdom and someday might help you to make a life-decision.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I am truly impressed with the picture and sound transfers of these movies.  Alien and Aliens are practically completely different movies with the new clarity.  Anyone who is a fan of this series needs to pick up these version.  I owe the DVD as well, but other reviews(and a great deal) made me pick this up.  I am not remotely disappointed.  My DVDs may as well be coasters at this point; nothing could beat these versions.

B00BSN0K1C|3.0|I ordered this Superman figure from here, but I got all 3 figures from a local Target as well (they hadn't displayed them yet, but got me the figures from the back as I knew they were in-stock).  I'll keep this review to the Superman figure.<br /><br />First, if you're seeing any photo of this figure aside from the ones in the blister packaging (including the one used here on Amazon), look away and clear your head.  The preview photos look nothing like the actual product.  The model seems to be of a higher quality, no suit texture, more matted paint, and resembles the character more so than the actual figure.<br /><br />The packaging is nice, vibrant, and solid.  Definitely display-worthy (if that's the route you choose to take), but the bottom corners have been cut to an angle where they are easily bent, so if you're looking for collector-mint quality, you might be shuffling through a few before you find one in pristine condition.<br /><br />With that said, this isn't a bad figurine.  Articulation is pretty good (though it suffers from a loose neck/head joint as do most Mattel Movie Masters).  No torso bend like some other MMs, but I couldn't care less about that (I think it'd break-up the look/flow of the suit too much).  The figure doesn't resemble Henry Cavill exactly, but it's not a terrible likeness.  Though, of the 3 first wave figures, it's just slightly ahead of Zod for likeness, while both are leaps-and-bounds behind Jor-El (easily the best of the trio).  The cape isn't fabric (it's a stiffer rubber-type material), but that's fine in my opinion.  Finally, the paint jobs are pretty good...B range I'd say, but some flaws in this Wave 1 set.<br /><br />The issues here are many, which is why I have a lower rating.  First, the paint job appears to be hit-or-miss.  Both my Supes have some 'blue-ishness' on the red of his chest shield.  This seems to be affecting a lot of the early runs, but some are better than others (one of mine has 3 spots of a blue hue on the chest plate, while the other only has one).  One of them also has a scuff of some sort on the side of one leg just below the knee joint (looks like the paint was rubbed while still wet).  Will try to find a good color-match to spot treat that (might try to redden the shield as well).  Both of my figures have the 5 o'clock shadow too.  Yes, apparently, this Superman shaves.  Again, this seems to be mitigated in more recent runs, but most have a 'dirty' look to their face.  A quick tip is to use a Q-tip and acetone to remove the shading, if you're up for it.  Just be careful not to pull off the face paint as well.  I don't mind it (you can see Cavill isn't exactly clean shaven in some promo shots).  Final issue is that while Zod and Jor-El stand without the aide of the included platforms, it's near impossible for Supes.  His cape is just too heavy for a good chunk of standing positions.  Even with his platform, it's tricky to keep him upright.  Basically, his knees need to be bent in order to re-center his gravity.  A minor annoyance, but for a figure that will probably be posed and displayed somewhere, one worth mentioning.<br /><br />Overall, the Superman figure is of decent quality.  Collectible?...the jury is out on that one, I think.  As a display set, I think they'd work a bit better than storing them unopened in the attic for 25 years hoping to get a nice return.  Though, a lot of the depends on how long the runs go (you can still find MM Batman Begins figures around for little money and there are still TDK and TDKR MM figures in toy stores) and how well the movie does.  Overall, for $15 not bad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. My little sister who is 5 really enjoyed it. I love it because it's a challenge and I never back down from a challenge. You get coins and I get a lot of stuff and I never have had to use actual money. I recommend this game to anyone looking to pass time.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|Remind me how silly movies were in the 80's Fun showing my grandchiled what we used to watch way back when, Like having this movie in my collection. You get a feel good time,

1426308469|5.0|Our three year old grandson became fascinated with dinosaurs after visiting a museum. We sent him this book, and he loves it!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|The show is sometime boring with too much legalese. Alicia cares more about practicing law than spending time with family. In fact her gay brother gets more attention than her children. The show is very left and liberal leaning. She doesn't care about religion or any type of spirituality for her children. The show portrays lawyers as sharks always looking for the highest and more appetizing client.  The infighting at the office for money and the lack integrity gives a bad impression of lawyers and the way they manipulate their cases.
B00A83075M|5.0|6 yr old grandson really liked this movie and it is in his top 10 DVD list. I haven't watched it all the way through but seems to be okay for kids.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Absolutely Love this show. Wouldn't change anything. Can't wait for next season.  I have the first season taped and am watching it again.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie with it's many who dunnit twists. Matthew very good as always and adds alot of flavor to his characters. Highly recommend this movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not put the book down. The entire triolgy was awesome. Highly recommend the series to anyone that loves and great romance with a lot of spice.
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus is about two sworn enemies, who happen to be magicians.  Not illusionists, but actual magicians, and they carefully tend their young apprentices to continue their feud.  Although the POV's change between sections of the book, it's still understandable and all the characters are interesting, so most of the time  I wasn't worried about getting back to any one character.  Well-thought-out, detailed novels seem to be uncommon these days, so it was a delight to read something so descriptive and so unique.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was selected by our book club because of its topic and generally good reviews. There was consensus, however, that this was not the author's best book and many were disappointed.  We felt that the author did not deal effectively with the emotions of the characters and that there were many parts of the book that seemed very unrealistic. The ending left many feeling confused and  wanting better closure. We felt that topics such as this have been better written by Jody Picoult.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Too bad it got cancelled before even the first season was finished.  Hopefully someday it will come back in some form

B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Could have been a Sunday Hallmark Movie.  Enjoyable but predictable.  Glad I rented it for 5.00 and didn't spend movie prices to see it
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Entertaining at all levels.  I can't think of a single episode that was disappointing.  Characters actually come and go as required in the story!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is pretty fun. I could see my kids liking it, but I'm not handing my phone over! :-)
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A favorite! Husband got this as a surprise &#34;Love you&#34; gift. One of his favorites. Can't wait for the next one!
B00BF123WG|3.0|Not sure if this was a very lengthy movie cut into somewhat connected snippets or snippets haphazardly clipped together in an attempt to make a movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A compelling read.  I was sold on the characters from their first appearance.  The sadness of the story is sweetened with the humor and the personal quest of the characters to find some meaning to it all.  It certainly made me think about my life and my decisions.  I would love to think that many teens are reading this book because it looks at love and life with real heart.  I think it would also be a good idea to read the book before the movie comes out, because unless some genius can figure out how to look into the human soul and human consciousness and show it on film, the movie is going to come across as merely a tearjerker.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A fun read for anyone but especially those who like a good back story.  I love how used history as the backdrop for the novel!  Great concept.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|The movie was engaging, entertaining and well acted.  Bradley Cooper was especially good, Jennifer Lawrence was also good, I'm not sure I would say Oscar caliber.
B0097K21YW|4.0|This is the same old concept of the catapult type game that angry birds stole and made so successful.  However, the character design and scenery is enough to make it feel original and is complemented by the gameplay tweak where you aim forward instead of pulling back to launch the projectile.  Overall an excellent game that is easy to get control of, but requires enough accuracy as you move forward to continue providing a challenge.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|An absolutely wonderful movie. It is more than just the typical LGBT movie. It's a love story that happens to have two gay characters in the movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for the next one.  If it is as good as the current game it will be exciting.  Would like to see a longer version. This keeps you thinking.
B00A7Q814Y|3.0|For me the criteria for judging a big collection by a major orchestra are:<br />1.  Does it include previously unavailable live performances (greatest example of this are the box sets of the \\"Anthology of the Royal Concertgebuow Orchestra)?<br />2.  Are the discs remastered to significantly improved sound?<br />3.  Is the packaging outstanding, making it a collector's item (example: Solti's Ring cycle in a deluxe box including a Blu Ray of the entire cycle).<br /><br />In my opinion, this box set fails on all three criteria. Yes, it has some great performances, but many collectors will have acquired those classic discs already. It has few, if any, truly outstanding previously unreleased material. And it sets a new standard of poor packaging. (The outer sleeve is thin paper. The box in which the discs are placed does not have any graphic to even indicate which side is up - you could pick up the bottom half by mistake. The sleeves in which discs are housed are cheap cardboards with poor graphics.)<br /><br />Vienna Philharmonic is a great orchestra. Some of these performances are genuine classics. I am sure they have many unreleased treasures in their archives.<br /><br />A great box set celebrating VPO's legacy would have (1) all classic performances remastered in SACD, (2) at least some unreleased archival performances added, and (3) a collectible packaging worthy of this great institution. A great opportunity has been lost. I must add that DGG have done similarly poor job elsewhere as well, for example in releasing Karajan's legacy, some of which is only released in Europe, some in Korea, none in USA.<br /><br />The only people who might find this release attractive are those who are starting a collection, and do not have many of the performances included here already.
0802798225|4.0|I kept hearing amazing things about this book, and so I finally had to break down and read it. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed!! This book is a great love story. You could really tell how much they loved each other throughout the book.<br />I loved the background characters as well. I felt that they all played a very crucial role in the book. They were written very well, and kept me interested throughout the entire book. Background characters can easily be ignored sometimes, but in this book they were just as important.<br />There was action, friendship, drama, and romance in this book. Everything should that should make a book great. I really enjoyed it. I did. It just wasn't a book that I \\"couldn't put down.\\" There was just something missing for me. For that reason, I am giving it 4 stars. I liked it though and would probably read it again.<br />I would not recommend this book to younger people due to drugs, gangs, sex, and language.
0307744434|5.0|I adore this book.<br />I read it over the course of two nights staying up until over 4am simply because I had a hard time putting it down.<br />It was enchanting, magical, and well-written.

All these elements add up to a rare 5-star review from me.<br />I look forward to seeing what Erin M. comes up with next.

B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Another great movie from Nicholas Sparks! This movie had it all. It was the perfect balance of mystery and suspense, romance and humor. Julianne Hough is proving to be a very convincing actress in whatever roll she plays. She can hold her own against seasoned peers of the craft. She has a genuine warmth and depth of character that makes her a joy to watch. Josh Duhamel, what needs to be said? He's ruggedly adorable! He plays his character with such comfortable ease that you would almost think the part was written based on him.. The love scenes were tastefully subtle, yet steamy. The unexpected twist at the end was intriguing. I liked the idea of letters being written by the dying mother to her children to be given at their graduation, weddings, etc. The only thing I didn't like is the occult symbol in the necklace given to Katie, the main character. Occult symbolism permeates everything from Disney animations to the music industry, and everything coming out of Hollywood. Tired of seeing it everywhere and in everything! Occultism has come out of the closet, so to speak, and Hollywood  shoves it in our faces constantly.

This is another slice of primo Iggy in collaborative mode with James Williamson.<br /><br />This album is rougher than New Values but not as off-the-rails as Raw Power.<br /><br />It's simply killer rock'n'roll with no filler.<br /><br />Fans won't be disappointed.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I suppose I should have read the book before I watched the movie, but I didn't... I still really enjoyed both, especially considering they are very different stories. The writing was beautiful and the characters deep and flawed and lovable.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I am now almost finished with the third book in the series and can't wait to buy the fourth. Excellent story!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|I started reading this thinking it would be amazing. I purchased it for my mom in book form and bought the ebook so I could read and discuss with her. When I first started reading this, it was just putting me to sleep. All it was in the beginning was Jack talking about what he and his mom did in room all day. Written from the 5 year old boys perspective, it was interesting toward the end of the book. After the first couple chapters it got interesting and I really couldn't put it down, but the first half was meh. You will enjoy it if you just get past that part. Worth finishing and worth the read.
B00280LYIM|5.0|AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING that is all I can say about this book AMAZING! I can't wait to start the next one!
B004TI1WME|5.0|I just downloaded it because it looked like it could be useful when shopping looking at the screen shot. This is so much better than the stock calculator. You can see your whole list of expenses and edit it as you need to. I'm reading the reviews and everyone seems to think you can't print your table but you can. I just copied my list and put it in Google docs. I can save it there or print it. You can change the colors of the calculator and the mode your phone stays in while using it. I will be keeping this around, this is one of the best faotd's, definitely one I will find very useful.

143353083X|5.0|If you are looking for a Bible to read every day, please choose a Bible that has no commentary and large margins. Reading a Bible like this will distract you from the actual words of Scripture (it will distract you because it is so well written and interesting). I keep my study Bible tucked away in my bookshelf and reference it only for in-depth Bible study and for answering questions that burn inside my brain. The ESV Study Bible is perfect for just that. This is an amazing study companion and my go-to for deep and difficult questions. This is not something for your daily quiet times, though. Far too distracting.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The best game I've played in a while on the Kindle.  Game play was smooth.  Graphics are beautiful.  If you get stuck they have hints that I think we're just subtle enough to push you in the right direction.  Reminds me of my days playing Myst games.  Heading to app store to see if new one is out yet ;)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun for anyone who wants mine craft but want to go anywhere with it and not have to bring a heavy laptop or risk bringing a Xbox system to a friend's house. You can change your mind and friends in this game. It ROCKS
B001RIY4WE|4.0|If you embrace the modern world and haven't seen T2 before and you older than 15 ... something's wrong with you.<br /><br />Just remember this &#34;Skynet&#34; edition is just a marketing gimmick. It's the extended version on blu ray with a couple of links to a website that you probably never needed to see in life itself. If you bored and like surfing the net, then this is definitely you.<br /><br />Buy this product for the movie or your movie collection ... if you have it on dvd, save your money. In my opinion, this doesn't look much better than a standard dvd displayed on a 120htv icd television.
B003W16T9K|5.0|I bought 4 set of CDs in my last purchase I think this one is the best. I quite appreciate Abbado and Europe Chamber Orchestra introduced a totally new Schubert to me. I like this version of Schubert Symphony, maybe better than Karajan's.
B00471JSR4|4.0|The short is this is a great movie with good special effects so blu ray format really helps over a dvd format.<br /><br />Looking forward to the sequel ... did I mention this movie is awesome? I had no expectations on this film, expecting a flop but it was really entertaining semi-sci-fi action with some good laughs in between.
B009J2VMXY|3.0|38 version of Rite of Spring and 1 version of Violin Concerto in D major. I appreciate the effort for the collect so many rite of spring but I have to point out most CDs are not in good condition. The performance of the conductor and orchestra did not meet my anticipate and also too much background noise in the early recordings. Personally I feel the version by Lenard Bernstein and Karajan during 1970s are the best, However, even for these two versions I still feel the last chapter （II- VI sacrificial dance) fell into chaos under with A1+DT990. I have a digital recording from internet and I feel this one is better controlled in music.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read all three in one week-end.<br />The violence was no surprise, given the original premise, and neither was the seemingly selfish traits of the main character for the same reason.<br />A good read with meaning that will stay with me for quite some time.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Downloaded Temple Run 2 when our 13 yo grandson suggested it.  Fun & challenging and probably good for the aging brain! Graphics of the runner escaping the creepy creature are realistic -- had sweaty palms the first few times I played. Somewhat addictive; you really want to keep the poor runner from flying over the edge.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|My DVD movie for last night was \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" starring Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Well, I'd consider this  to be a gripping and provocative movie, but one that's badly flawed, mainly in the story. The acting, photography and sound track are all good. If the story, as it unfolds, doesn't bother you, then you may find it to be an excellent movie to watch.<br /><br />The movie opens with a truly gristly scene. A family man, Gerard Butler, undergoes an unprovoked and brutal attack in his home and it results in the death of his beautiful wife and his pretty young daughter as well as severely wounding him. It's one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in the movies and you may not care to watch it. Just be forewarned, at least. In any case, the perpetrators are caught and tried, but Butler doesn't feel that the punishment fits the crime and feels that the prosecutor was more interested in advancing his own career goals rather than finding justice. Okay, I'm sure there are lot's of cases like this in our murky criminal justice system. I'm also sure that most of the movie audience would agree with Butler's feelings.<br /><br />From this point on, Butler carries out his own personal system of justice to inflict the pain and suffering on the two murderers that he, his wife and child had experienced. An eye for an eye, so to speak. The results became increasingly gory. He's quickly rounded up by the law, with Jamie Foxx in the role of the lead prosecutor. However, keeping the clever Butler in captivity proved to be difficult. Things kept happening out in the real world while Butler remained safely in jail. It seems the man was much more clever than anyone had expected. In my opinion, this was where the story began to go wrong. The things Butler was able to do from within prison began to ring less and less believable, until, finally, the whole story just turned to nonsense unless you have the type of mind that can just go along with almost anything. I don't, and things like this will ruin a movie for me.<br /><br />Okay, it was a well done movie. A lot of people might enjoy it and not be so picky. I have credibility problems with the story and their strong enough that I can see no better than three stars as a rating.<br /><br />Gary Petersonalong with almost anything. I don't, and things like this will ruin a movie for me.<br /><br />Okay, it was a well done movie. A lot of people might enjoy it and not be so picky.

B0006GAOJA|4.0|My father used to like boxing. I can remember how he'd be glued to the radio during Joe Lewis fights and later how everything was secondary to watching the fights on TV on Friday nights. I didn't care for boxing. Both my mother and I thought it was barbaric. Strangely enough, I find the more recent Mixed Marshal Arts to be much more interesting. They're more like an actual fight rather than two guys standing in a ring and beating one another senseless.<br /><br />In any case, I was shopping for a few DVDs in the Wal-Mart five-dollar bins and came across \\"Raging Bull\\" starring Robert DeNiro and directed by Martin Scorsese. Well, I still don't like boxing, but those are big-name movie people. Into the cart it went. I can't say I enjoyed the film. It was dreary and depressing. The characters were low-brow and they lived in a dreary low-brow world. The film was in black and white which gave it an old fashioned feel and fit the dreary environment. Nice Job! I wondered why more directors don't use this technique to set or match the mood. The acting was excellent. I've lived and worked in some lower-class East Coast settings and director Scorsese had a keen eye and ear. The cast came across as real people, albeit not the kind of people I'd like to be with. Their F-speak language was authentic and, unfortunately, has spread since the time of this film. De Niro portrayed a brilliant fighter, but one who was also paranoid, jealous and cruel. He was the type of person you wouldn't want to cross. All was well done. I developed both feelings of sympathy and disgust for many of the characters as the movie progressed. I think that's an offshoot of good directing and good acting.<br /><br />So, this is a difficult movie for me to judge. Were all the production values of good quality? They were excellent. Did the story flow along in an understandable manner? Yes. Was it well acted and directed? Yes, of course. Now, did you like the movie and want to watch it again a second time? The answer to both is No.<br /><br />Gary Petersonanswer to both is No.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have always enjoyed reading Nelson DeMille's books.  This one fails.  I have not yet finished it but the constant puns, irrellevant asides, and foolish remarks that Mr. DeMille put in the mouth of John Corey do nothing to add to the narrative and detract from the possibilities of an exciting story.  Maybe he will recover and give us something to compare with CHARM SCHOOL, GOLD COAST  and PLUM iSLAND.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I recently purchased a Kindle Paperwhite.  As a former Nook Simple Touch user I was used to using a sleeve rather than a case.  For the price I am extremely satisfied with this case.  It fits the Paperwhite like it was made for it and provides quite a bit of cushioning.  I am still considering a standard case rather than a sleeve but when the \\"perfect\\" case costs $40 it's easy to convince myself to stay with this sleeve.<br />Great product!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a fast paced game lots of fun and challenges.  I like that it takes some thinking you dont just watch it and push buttons.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Okay as for book one... It's pretty good. Lots of mistakes but at least the story is good. Now on to the reason I've given one star.<br />I believe the first of these books I reviewed was the third and gave it three stars saying it was a good story but the editing was atrocious.  I'm now onto the fifth book and its only getting worse.  I'm actually mad I started this series because being this far in, I want to see how it all turns out.  The problem is the farther along the series goes the worse the writing gets.  Book 5 is so bad the author explains every single little detail leaving nothing to the imagination and constantly over stating the obvious.  I'm not sure if this is just filler to make the stories longer or the author is this bad but at this point I don't even think an editor would be able to save the books.<br />So anyway I've come back here to the first book to let anyone know who's considering starting this series that there is many many much better fantasy series to spend your money on.  If you do buy it please feel free to comment on my review and let me know what your opinions of it are. I don't think I'm a book snob. This series is just that bad.

This book also includes information on planning and calculating the number of stitches required to evenly apply a given border, use of colors, stitch instructions and other very useful tid-bits of information.<br /><br />I am so glad I purchased this book and would recommend it to crocheters at any skill level. This is a wonderful and much appreciated addition to my fiber arts library.

193700788X|1.0|I am so bummed how bad this is. The last four books show how little she cares for these characters. The first few were so good. The TV Show was based on the books then the show became super popular and she based the books on the show. This last one she just threw in a potpourri of every character and memory Sookie ever had and made a very bad stew of a story. What a shame. To bring Quinn in?? How lame.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|good read, good inspiration to be grateful for the opps that come your way, interesting analysis of how some have overcome adversity
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|It's reasonably interesting, although I fear it is a little too pleased with making both Hitchcock and Alma look like jerks--a kind of prurient, \\"untold story\\" quality that, were it not about someone so grand, might be more fun. But it is about someone actually deserving of reverence, so maybe a little kinder? I dunno. It ultimately left me feeling like, Who cares? Genius is allowed a little more wiggle room and maybe I don't care how the omelet got made.
B00B4666QG|5.0|1st. -- This particular version is in Italian or Spanish.  I don't remember.  But you can select &#34;English&#34; version.in the settings.  But its a minor hassle.<br /><br />The movie however, is well done.  It kinda is similar to the BOURNE genre.  Many scenes and techniques are very reminiscent of Bourne Ulitimatum.  I was very pleased with the screenplay.  I was not bored at any time.  The story addresses real life situations in the intelligence communities, and for this reason the Title was changed and its getting snubbed by the media.  Very intelligent challenge your powers of problem solving.  A film that you will want to watch again and so worth buying.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|This is easily one of the scariest, most uncomfortable movies I've ever seen. I loved it, but I'll never watch it again.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I heard on NPR (Rob Mondello?) the storyline resembled the Japanese movie \\"Battle Royal\\" of the last decade but Hollywood always out does other countries when it comes to movies, especially action movies.  Loved it and can't wait for the sequel!

B00AAQHP66|5.0|I am not a surfer, Nor do I seek out surfing movies. With that said, this movie is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen (35 yrs and I can't think of a better movie). I found myself having A LOT in common with Jay, in a way that I was not allowed to be a child either, which makes me who I am today.<br /> If you like a movie ( in general, not just surfing movies ) that will have you cheering, cursing, cheering some more, then crying, then cheering even more, then do watch this movie...<br /><br />If I could give it more stars I would. The acting is on point across the board, everyone in the movie was great.<br /><br />Just an absolutely amazing movie.

Between this dvd and the &#34;Live in San Francisco&#34; (filmed in 2001), you can really learn a lot about Joe's technique. Ton's of close-up shots of the man's fingers in action. Joe's guitar playing is stunning!

I didn't want to buy a new ipod since our family has so many other devices we can play music from -- android phones, ipad, nexus 7 -- and I didn't want to invest in a new sounddock either.  This product works with all of them and the sound is fantastic!  Saved me a lot of money :)

B005XUC398|5.0|Great acting! I just wish the movie was longer. The story was told very well but wished it was longer as I said because there is so much more that happened that canot be included in a 2 hour movie. It goes by fast to be sure. Lots of cussing and smoking so if you aren't into that beware! Interesting to see how other people &#34;get by&#34; on 2 million a year.  Insane.

B009NT0I06|5.0|It's Taylor...  and it's on vinyl.  The best of both worlds.  Sure, you don't get all the extra tracks like you might on a target cd, but there's something about vinyl records that give that full sound.  Taylor is a huge supporter of vinyl.  It tends to make one listen to the whole album in the order they chose...  she's the one that pointed that out.  This work of hers does not disappoint.  A great collection of wonderful tracks.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm officially hooked on this series. I can't wait until Season 4 begins again. The season finale was a shocker!! Wonderful DVD!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|In this book, I overall felt things were untouched that needed to be touched on and others were over-written. Play-by-plays of Eagles games helped develop the story between Pat and his father and shed little on the possible mental health issues he shares with his father, but its never really revealed. I was disappointed that their was no real revelation in his efforts to heal his mental status and the love story ended rather sourly in my opinion. Tiffany knows exactly what she wants in the end while Pat sees the sensibility in them being together but never really admits to himself his true feelings for her.<br /><br />I really liked the theme of mental health and how it affects everyone around you. I found this to be the driving force behind the plot, but the relationship between Tiffany and Pat was rather flat, especially if you compare it to the screenwriting that stemmed from this book. Pat's obsession with silver linings was summed up with a silly tie to clouds in the end, which I thought was weak.<br /><br />Overall though, I enjoined the book and felt a constant need to know how things were going to develop. I only wish it would have developed more.
0439023513|2.0|It is incredibly hard to write a good story completely in the first person.  The author succeeded brilliantly at doing just that in \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  But here in \\"Mockingjay\\"  the author fails miserably.  The entire series has been building up to the point where the entire nation erupts into civil war against the Capital.  We want to know what is happening in that war, but we simply cannot because we are stuck in the mind of a 17 year-old girl (or is it 18?).  A 17 year old girl is not going to know all that is happening in a war.  She is not going to be in the front lines very much.  She is not going to understand the complexities of the strategy of the two sides in the conflict and she is not going to be entrusted with knowledge of battle plants.  I mean, would you trust any of that to a 17 year old?  Of course not.  So, what do we get?  We get a war story told from the perspective of a character who does not do much in the war except try to figure out how to be some kind of figurehead.  And her constant pouting and confusion over which boy to like and rebelling against those who are over her and trying to advise her gets very tiring very quickly.  And unlike the other two books in the series, when the action scenes are finally reached they are not very exciting or very well explained.  This is especially true in the last third of the book when the characters are fighting their way through the Capital.  There are traps and dangers everywhere and we should be feeling the suspense.  We have felt it so many times before in the previous books of this series when there have been traps and dangers.  But, for some reason, the suspense is gone.<br />The lack of suspense and the overabundance of pouting and confusion from the main character really just killed this book.  How disappointing.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Even though I quite liked the book overall and I had a good time reading it, it does feel little unbalanced when I think back about it. For the first 85% of the book the Chinese are succeeding in pretty much everything but then everything goes sideways. It does feel like there was lot more material written and the editors were trying to thin the weed and cut too deep sometimes... But if you're a Clancy fan, you'll probably like the book

B00AO3K01C|4.0|This was a very captivating book with an original and engaging storyline. I didn't really connect too much with Ruth as found her somewhat distant and cold but loved Nao and her family. A great insight too into Japanese culture, though I hope that the school bullying Nao experienced was not a true reflection of school in Japan. The great grandmother and life in the monastery provided peaceful respite as well as a nice touch of otherworldly mystery. Overall a great read.
B00CATSONE|3.0|The beginning of the book is nothing about Tesla. One may get confused as to what this is actually about. After the intro the info about Tesla is really interesting even if the author is a bit biased. Overall if you can get passed the beginning its an interesting read.
B005BQNC44|5.0|Jaycee is a remarkable girl and a real testament to the ability of the human spirit to survive through horrific times. There is something special about Jaycee which may be the only reason she survived this and lived to tell the tale. I really don't think her captor had any plan to keep her alive but somehow the little light she managed to shine surrounded by such insanity and downright evil saved her and her children. It's very easy in the rapid paced consumer society we live in to gloss over what happened to her and focus on the positive outcome, but I think it is just as important to remember that she lived in horror for many years before her captor began to back off and create his own dysfunctional version of a family. The love she had for her pets was truly inspiring and she is doing wonderful work now in sharing the healing power of animals with the young people her foundation helps. I wish her every happiness now, moment by moment.

B009JCL58G|2.0|First off, I only bought the track \\"finale\\" because from what I listened to, the rest was just really repetitive.<br /><br />I absolutely love the song, but there are a lot of clicks and clacks, which are rather distracting and disappointing.  I usually don't care at all about sound quality, but this was just bad.
B000FC13MM|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but have no desire to read it again.  By the end I found I was skimming whole sections.  Liked the main character, but never worked up a lot of interest in the characters as a whole.  Moggett was interesting, but his/its characterizations were unsatisfying.

B00CL68QVQ|1.0|It gets 1 star because it won't let you rate it as 0 stars.  Probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  Mental illness and awkward situations, gambling and characters that just were not interesting<br /><br />I fell asleep twice and had to keep going back to figure out what happened.  Only to find out NOTHING happened.  Very bas
B007EC27QM|5.0|love the large format of the numbers and how the back space works just like it should. Grateful for the plus.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|No words can describe how much I love this movie!  I am so glad I got it delivered to my home with ease.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I enjoy mysteries, preferably without graphic violence.  This one had enough surprises to satisfy me.  I also appreciated not having to read explicit sex scenes.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Stay with the free app. Don't waste your money on this app. Too many bugs, Slow to load, caused my phone to lock up and required too many restarts. After the page finally loaded the content was accurate but it was a pain to get there.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have an original Kindle Fire model, and this app works just fine. I have had no issues with it, and runs as I would expect it to.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I purchased the Platinum version for 99 cents, very buggy, so I went back to the free version. A much better app.<br />Stay with the free version, I do NOT recommend spending the $2.99 for the Platinum version.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I must admit that I love the Pendergast novels. They are often filled with far-fetched rubbish, great leaps of faith, unbelievable twists , bad German  and Pendergast is an ode to Sherlock Holmes, but I love them anyway. They are a perfect escape. This one was particularly diverting. Read it, it's like the last piece of chocolate cake that you promised to your son, but ate before he got home from school, and then blamed it on the dog, a truly guilty pleasure!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The end feels so close to part of my life that I do not want to go back to. It's a great book
0756407915|3.0|The Wise Man's Fear is the second entry from newbie fantasy author Patrick Rothfuss, and it continues the tale of Kote/Kvothe's slow development into the heroic, sympathist Edema Ruh of this world's mythic fabric.  It picks up swiftly and captures the voice and style that Rothfuss used to such great effect in his first novel in which he built the scaffold upon which Kvothe's journey would hopefully be erected.  Alas, however, despite continued character development, some interesting situations, and more glimpses into this completely unique setting, the actual core of the novel (Kvothe's development) is painstakingly slow and unrewarding.  As a reader, we are attached to the protagonist, seeing more of the world than the interesting, yet overtly Hogwarts-esque, Academy.  While this brief conclusion from his activities here is welcome after the amount of time devoted to it in the first novel, it is also a bit hard to swallow at first blush.  The characters surrounding him are so developed at this point, that they feel almost cut off and abandoned, and the novel struggles to regain what is lost by stripping his companions.  Yes, the ever-mysterious Denna still enters and exits the narrative with her frustratingly casual invasions, but the other side characters are largely flat and uninteresting by comparison to Kvothe's coterie of allies from the first novel.  This continues a theme of poorly realized concepts that plagues this novel throughout.  It seems as if Rothfuss is struggling with his vision, forcing Kvothe to experience all that his world has to offer if for no other reason than to say \\"look how cool this place I've designed is!\\"  He enters and swiftly exits these areas without much cause or reason, which is fine at first, but gets old rapidly.<br /><br />The first of these events is the courtly intrigue he experiences as an aid to the Maer.  The storyline is compact and interesting, with the giving of rings and the other nuances of the society just fascinating enough to feel exciting.  Just as quickly as this sub-plot builds, however, it ends.  Kvothe is dispatched to a vague forest and saddled with uninteresting allies.  The novel plods along until a brief set-piece of action that, while definitely interesting, is too brief to be rewarding and too convenient to be believable.  This marks probably the first step of many into this realm of Kvothe twisting into an almost sophomoric charicature - a hero designed by a five year old (and he'll be the best musician ever, and he'll be amazing at magic, and he'll shoot lightning, and, and, and...).  It's cheap and it discounts the truly humanistic aspects that Rothfuss exerted so much energy in during Name of the Wind.  Kvothe was such a living, breathing, and interesting character in that novel, and this seems to be the opposite.<br /><br />This immediately gets worse with the much-discussed Felurian episode.  Simply put, this episode is absolutely ridiculous.  It reads like a high schooler virgin's misguided porn-influenced version of sex, and frankly, it's too damned stupid to be in this novel.  Frustratingly lengthy, overwhelmingly uninteresting, and laughably ridiculous, this portion of the novel threatens to deep-six the legitimacy that Patrick built via his first novel.  The continued obsession with sex following this encounter sounds more like the made up exploits of a ranting teenager than anything real or worthwhile.  While sex, even graphic sex, has place in literature (Game of Thrones), it typically comes with purpose.  With Martin, the crude and cruel nature of some of the characters is emphasized via the sexual nature of their exploits, and in that way, the graphic nature has impact and value to the narrative.  In Wise Man's Fear, however, it is pointless, immature slop that plops its unyieldy self into the narrative over and over for no other reason than to say \\"look at Kvothe, god of orgasms!\\"  It's stupid and it cheapens an otherwise rich experience.<br /><br />The last complaint is that the narrative seems to be at odds with itself.  Nothing actually develops over the course of this novel.  We are no closer to realizing the truth behind Denna, or the seven, or the Cthaeh, or why Kvothe is growing weaker, or, or, or... I realize that this is popular, especially in fantasy, and that mystery drives interest which drives profits, but the novel suffers for it.  Kvothe is plopped into new scenery for chunks at a time, only to essentially say \\"I'm bored\\" and walk off to the next place.  All the while, Kvothe's constant deus ex machina plot armor just begs the reader to challenge the legitimacy of the prose.  Each culture he encounters has set rules that they disregard if for no other reason than Kvothe is too awesome to obey them.<br /><br />With all of this said, there are some positives.  Rothfuss does add some new elements to the narrative that add continuing intrigue to the story line.  The frame of the story, Kote's story, is probably the single-most-functional piece of this novel, if for no other reason than Kote is flawed, believable, and really well-written.  His mysteries are so interesting, and he's not ruined by the idiocy of his youthful version's ridiculous exploits.  Likewise, Denna and Devi are both still interesting enough that I find myself wondering what will happen with both characters, and the Academy is a warm and welcome setting that works very well even if it does recycle some tropes from the Harry Potter series.  Though my review is heavy on criticism, I acknowledge that Rothfuss has great style and voice, and that he is a very welcome addition to fantasy.  I think that perhaps this novel's primary failing is simply failing the expectations set by the phenomenal Name of the Wind, and I fully intend to read the third in the series with the hopes that Rothfuss regains more of that edge.
0740797719|4.0|The strength of this book is its illustrations and brevity.  On each topic, the author makes his point fast then provides one of his beautiful Dinotopia illustrations as an example.  Given the cost of this book, the quality of the color printing is impressive.
1936608898|4.0|Good quality hard cover book. Has great healthy recipes and a lot of interesting information. I'm surprised by all the tips it has.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|CErtainly an adult/mature film.  The story is Cliché, but likable.  The random comic moments are great.  For the most part the music is very &#34;Glee&#34; (good).
B000F8O35U|5.0|It really sucks that Disney only releases and re-releases their movies every couple of years.  My daughter was obsessed with the idea of the Little Mermaid, even though she had never seen the movie, so I looked far and wide for the DVD.  I found this seller who was selling used copies in good condition.  I think I paid $28 for it, which I don't consider a bad price, considering when the re-release them, they mark them up to about $25 or $26.  I received this used DVD in perfect condition!  Very happy.  And now, we get to watch The Little Mermaid every....single.....day!
B007ZYJMU8|5.0|This movie portrays hope in life when hope is lost. It portrays God in a godless world. I loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game in the wooooooooooooooooooorllllllllllldddddddddd smily face :) I think it is kinds better than the xbox version maybe it could get better than PC.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I am a new fan of Dexter's...just started watching the shows.  I started back at Season 1 and am working my way up.  Love Michael C Hall...and all the characters.  Michael is great in the role of Dexter!!  It's funny..it's suspenseful...good plots....you just want to keep watching.  So sad that Season 8 is the last.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I was leery about renting this movie because of Seth Rogen.  I thought it was going to be extremely cheesy with the junior high type of humor that he is known for these days.  However, everyone watching it was really surprised by the depth of the movie while keeping the funny moments in tact.  I've recommended this to others as a must see.  I give it 4 stars only because it is not the big budget oscar powerhouse type.  I reserve 5 stars for those.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It has great characters, a great pace, plenty of twists, characters develop with all their skeletons and maturity etc Gorgeous setting, idilic escape.
193700788X|1.0|*** Spoilers below ******<br /><br />Ok, so even though I knew who Sookie ended up with and I knew a LOT of the fans were upset, I read this. I was not about to read 12 books and not finish the series.<br /><br />It has the same problem the last several books do..continuity. It's so bad I kept expecting Tara to turn into an african american lesbian vampire that had stolen twin babies, LaFayette to show up needing a duplex from Sam for he and Jesus, Jessica to decide she had a thing for Karin, and Godric to come spouting some John Lennonism about Eric getting his due.<br /><br />Although I was pretty sure that in the end she'd end up with Sam, I was hoping against hope that Niall would come in and save the day and have some fairy way that she and Eric could be together.<br /><br />I don't like the way the whole Eric situation was handled, for the amount of book that it took up, it may as well have been Sookie's grocery list.<br /><br />I do think that trying to clean everything up in 300 pages made it feel very rushed, and while she tried to make a lot of old characters show up for some closure, some of them are glaringly missing especially Bubba, he really should have been there.<br /><br />It was just not a good read, but neither were book 11 & 12. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for the copy I read. Can I tell you how bored I got with Sookie's over abundant yard? I didn't find myself enjoying one single part except when Claude put the spell on Newlin & Glassport in the van. THAT made me laugh.<br /><br />Either Ms. Harris clearly got bored and only finished out of obligation, or she was influenced by the changes Alan Ball made, or both. I'd have expected a halfassed unsatisfactory boring ending from a TV show, not from the person who gave birth to the characters we grew to love the last 12 years.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|on some nights, this is just my speed. i like the characters and their development .hope you enjoy, too. Uta

B000W9399S|5.0|If you value originality, you'll love the Discworld series.  Clever, funny, inventive, vivid, and very enjoyable.  A new twist on fantasy, humorism, and social commentary all at once.  Vonnegut meets Bradbury.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|loved the surprise ending.  This is a good movie without foul language and with good family values. I could watch this again

B004DMO8U4|5.0|fast, easy to find and download with my web enabled TV.<br />Great movie, lots of action.<br />Nicolas Cage was great.
B000002KHH|4.0|A good example of early Black Sabbath.  I have several of their albums and this ranks right up there.  The nice thing about Sabbath compared to many new heavy metal bands is that there is a lot of good musicianship and melody, in spite of the genre.  Contrast that with modern metal which seems to be about trying to fit as many notes as possible into the moment while having Satan join in on the singing.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I wanted a movie that didn't span the whole world, didn't have a romantic plot that made me cringe, or script writing that has me thinking \\"why?\\" at every turn. Dredd gave a cool character to follow, a suspenseful plot, and methodical action. I enjoyed the film's pacing and dialogue. The film showcased its action in a way that left me feeling at times uncomfortable. I liked that the script left room for this discomfort in scenes that show the fallout of violence and its patterns. All in all, I recommend Dredd to fans of action movies, hard-ass main characters, and to those who might want less \\"everything and the kitchen sink\\" in their film-watching experiences.

B00C7L4QB4|5.0|very cool unique show. characters and acting are great too. I look forward to the show every Thursday at 10:00PM.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The story evolves slowly and then you are caught and can't put it down, always wanting to know more. The story held my interest all the way through the book and I was able to believe the emotions of the various stages the characters were feeling.
125000098X|2.0|I think the author was inspired by harry potter. The 3 main characters Giles, Harry and Emma seem exactly like Hermione, Harry, and Ron personality-wise.<br /><br />While I liked this story, I do think some parts were far-fetched and getting a bit much. The author also seems to enjoy teasing us with 'bad things might possibly happen' however it very seldom happens, and things just always seem to work out for the characters. This lessens the tension, as I'm just not a fan of giving a character exactly what he/she wants.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br /> Giles immaturity about his wife and cruelty to his sisters seems rather hard to believe and rather foolish.  The stuff with seb getting involved with smuggling necessitating Harry to travel to south America in disguise seemed a bit out there.<br /><br />I think it is probably time to add some new characters and retire Harry, Emma, and Giles. They are good characters but they've already had their time in the limelight, plus they are so rich and successful there doesn't seem to be much struggle anymore.<br /><br />End spoiler<br /><br />Book was okay, but I honestly do not care if Seb who seemed rather spoiled gets into Cambridge or whether Giles is elected. Need more exciting things to happen than that to whet my appetite.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This was a really cool movie! It will keep you on the edge of your seat. The story is probably one that some can relate to.
B00902S0IS|5.0|The perfect sci fi movie. First saw it when it came out. It holds up and is definitely worth seeing.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|This movie received rave reviews, and I agree the whole cast is excellent, but underneath all of that is a movie that glorifies a brutal, selfish world.  It's okay for these people to beat up their family members, have sex with everyone in the workplace, bust up diners, because afterward they say they're sorry.  What?<br /><br /> Everyone in the story lies, disturbingly so.<br /><br /> Yet these flaws are supposed to be excused because these people are mentally ill.  I don't know when mental illness conveyed a new moral code on the populace.  How is okay to lie to your lover and your family?  Or just fine to ruin everyone else's dinner at the restaurant or frighten the children out trick-or-treating?  How is it all right to beat people up every time you're in a rage, which is pretty often in this movie?  They refuse to take their medication because it makes them feel &#34;foggy.&#34;  Right, but beating someone senseless is better?  The morality in this movie is downright narcissistic.  Everything is about me.  No one else matters.  None of the destruction I cause, even in other people's lives matters because after I break everything, I'll apologize.  Sorry, not enough for me.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I can't get tired of reading about Sookie Stackhouse…she is such a great character. I hope there are more to come in this series!
B003ASLJK4|5.0|It had been a while since I first saw (and fell in love with) this movie.  I'd forgotten it for a while, but was happy to rediscover it.  It provokes thought - about self knowledge, self-discovery, values, dreams, life options, what we create and what we settle for and --why. Options for women; choices that different people make about how they live and experience life; the range and diversity of what constitutes fulfillment.  All good things to ponder from time to time. Happy to re-connect with these thoughts at this time in my life.
B00BR476TG|5.0|This movie has some amazing scenes in it.  It captivated me throughout and the cinematography was incredible! The story of this young man trapped at see with a tiger shows how we can adapt to our environment when necessary.
B008M87GJK|4.0|BBC news is nice capsulized version.  It loads quickly and gives the BBC perspective on the news, which is often more nuanced than local sources.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|If you happen to read this today May 15, 2013, please note that Google Play is offering this for half price PLUS a new update.<br /><br />Ive heard a lot about this app and many people raving about it.  So far, Ive been a bit disappointed.  The predictive text hasnt been that great.  It often doesn't get some of the most obvious things - even when Ive typed the same thing 5 times.  It also seems to have a really hard time with spell check.  If you havent typed the first letter correctly, it doesnt seem to figure it out.  It does best with small words like and, the ,a, of etc.  I am hoping that after a month , it will get better and really pay off.<br /><br />The customer support is virtually non existent.  Yes this is a very popular app, but if you check the website, they also have a huge staff not only in their UK headquarters but all over the world.  You cant seem to get any response from them.  Ive been waiting three weeks and still nothing.<br /><br />I definitely suggest you do the trial first...It seems to work well for most, so Im crossing my fingers and hope it gets better.  I cant speak of the update yet because I downloaded it from Amazon and they havent updated.  I know it has new themes which is only cosmetic.  Whether the predictive text and spell check will work better I dont know.  When you spell fissapearing and it doesnt correct it to disappearing when pretty much any standard keyboard would, that is a problem for me.
B009AOFNU4|4.0|Since this tiny dual stick controller is made to emulate a larger console style controller it feels a little small to the hand.  Set up was easy enough IF you have a blue tooth enabled PC,tablet,phone.  Just downloaded the drivers for the PC and I was on my way.  I only have an old midway collection to try it out with but it handled Defender, Robotron etc well.  Not necessarily a necessity but it is a fun little niche product.  Battery life is solid as I have only had to charge it once after many sessions of Defender.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I couldnt get my kindle to load and I found out it had an update.  After I downloaded the update it worked fine.  Great way to keep books on hand.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I thought, \\" Oh my they are going to make Lincoln a saint\\".  As a long time student of the Civil War era I must say they nailed it.  They got Lincoln's voice right (He did have a higher pitched voice and a down home accent).  He also was a clever politician and was not above \\"bending\\" the rules to get what he wanted.<br /><br />All the actors were superb.
B00A83075M|5.0|My family and I just thought this was a great movie!!!  Funny and sweet!  There were a couple of sad scenes, and a couple of scenes that I would compare to the scenes from Cinderella when the mean stepsisters tore Cinderellas ball gown!  (Those meanies!)  All in all very cute, lovable, and adorable main characters!  We have watched this movies a few times now!!  Highly recommend this movie!

0765325950|4.0|Overall, I was pleased with the conclusion of this mammoth series.  I thought Mr. Sanderson did quite well considering how many story-lines this series had accumulated.  I can't believe I'm the only one who thought that Morgase & Tallanvor (Sp?) would figure more prominently (or even at all!) in The Last Battle.  I haven't read all 1900+ other reviews but I also can't be the only one who sees the door left open, just a little bit, for a Next Generation of plots to germinate.  I mean, Aviendha had that vision of having quadruplets and Elayne was having twins, there ya go.  The Dragon's Peace with the Seanchan was to span 100 years and how were they going to deal with those Sharans?  So, call me a dreamer, I don't think its over.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|This just a great, different book that I couldn't put down. I understand now why it is one of the most popular stories. Hot, Sexy and dazzling beautiful Disaster is a book everybody should be reading.
B00BSWMITK|2.0|I was anticipating for a wow factor in this new record by Joe Satriani. Given all that buzz after the success of Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards, I hoped for a follow-up. But it seems that this new effort doesn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />I will give 2 honest reasons why and I hope people will give respect to it before jumping into conclusion:<br /><br />(a) Instead of moving forward to better compositions, Satch went shall I say...\\"A step backward...\\" after Wormhole wizards. Yep, that's right! I feel I'm listening to Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock - Part 2. The lunacy and the obscurity does not conjure up my understanding on how Satriani wants his audience to follow his direction. Quite frankly, this is by far an experimental endeavor which seems to fail through a large extent. Some of the songs do bring some sprite but the rest of the record just doesn't spell to me.<br /><br />This album brings a stark contrast on the way Black Swans was made. I felt that album gave me a more acceptable taste of Joe Satriani's music compared to this latest one. It seems that Joe is catering into his artistic trial side in Unstoppable Momentum rather than his more commercial friendlier sound in Black Swans. Furthermore, it seems the way the songs are lined-up feels like it resembles his first record, \\"Not of this Earth.\\" The way the songs are structured and ordered makes you give a sense of a dark mood mentality and most people are not interested with that.<br /><br />(b) A couple of musicians are, to me, unnecessary and by far, do not add more depth to what Joe plays in his music. Mike Keneally did bring dynamics in his keyboarding on Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards. But with Unstoppable Momentum, I felt like there's a bit more emphasis on the Keyboards and Joe is kind of stepping back in his guitar playing. To me, I'm contented with the 2 guitars, 1 bass, and 1 drummer lineup for both recording and touring. I don't see adding keyboards is necessary at all.<br /><br />Aside from the keyboardist, I never wished to have Vinnie Colaiuta in this lineup. I do agree that he's a \\"lead drummer\\" for any musician. Yet, all he did was just add some syncopated hi-hat playing and a few odd time-signatures and presto! If you're going to listen on how Vinnie played here, he obviously did 95% Jeff Campitelli drumming - nothing new! Yeah he's a big, hot shot drummer. But so far, he seems so useless in Satch's music and I don't think he should have been in this record. I'm pretty much contented with Jeff Campitelli and I think Joe should have sticked with him instead of getting another drummer.<br /><br />My last impression as well with Unstoppable Momentum is that these songs are some of the collected material that Joe discarded after recording Black Swans. He did mentioned on one of his video diaries that he may use some of the content he created for a new record and I'm sensing this is what he took from what was left over. Basically, some of the tunes we've just heard were maybe recycled song fragments to make a new one. If that's the case, Joe Satriani did not deliver in this record. I hope he could bring a better and fresher set of ideas that people are dying to listen.<br /><br />Lets just wait on what's in store with the next Joe Satriani record and hopefully, its what fans want rather than this cacophony!<br /><br />P.S. - I was wishing to give this record a 1 star. But a 2 star grading will suffice to my humble opinion.

0767802470|5.0|I just saw a disc with footage from 1941 that made me think I was watching the 1981 Das Boot.<br /><br />It is A Newsreel History of the Third Reich: Vol. 7, or, History of the Third Reich: Vol. 7. The program is 89 minutes in all, and has 9 or 10 minutes of the most amazing scenes, literally a short version of Das Boot.<br /><br />Everything is there: The destroyer nearly running over the sub; the attack on the merchant ship, the meeting of the two U-Boats at sea, the emergency dives, the cutaways to the Tiefenmesser (the depth gauge) the fixing of the broken valves, and the crew riding in the conning tower with the water splashing them.<br /><br />It is like watching a 40-year earlier black & white short version of Das Boot.
0385349947|5.0|Once you read this book it will be obvious why there is controversy surrounding this author & the topic of her book.  I appreciate that someone has finally put into words the struggles women face in the workplace.  As a young professional newly out of school, it is very evident that leadership & management is still thought of as a man's game.  It is frustrating to not have the same opportunities as men just because employers know that as a woman I might need to take maternity leave in the future.  This book brings to the forefront of our minds the hurdles that still need to be broken down for there to be actual gender equality in the workplace.  This author is a great leader & has so much to share with women AND men.

1163208493|5.0|Although written before the modern age of transformational grammar this is still a terrific book for the beginner in linguistics. Having been published in the 1920s the approach is of course more grounded in classical structural linguistics, but that's fine because the beginner needs to learn that first before getting into the technicalities of Chomsky's transformational theory or later developments such as cognitive linguistics, specialized offshoots such as head driven phrase structure grammars, harmonic phrase structure grammars, or modern re-inventions of structuralism such as biogenetic structuralism, etc. The book takes a grammar based approach to language typology and the classification of languages, with examples ranging from Chinese to Eskimo to Amerindian languages like Nootka.<br /><br />Besides covering grammar there are excellent chapters or sections on phonetics, phonetic drift, and word morphology. Because Sapir started off his career in comparative Germanic languages and then subsequently expanded his language studies to many other non-Germanic languages, he developed a great sense of word phonetics and word morphology which he put to good use in this book and also was useful later in his career as more of a theoretician.  As a result of this broad learning and especially his expertise in Amerindian languages, he came to realize that many of the traditional ideas he'd had about language which were mainly based on Indo-European language patterns were wrong. I also found the chapter on language families and classification particularly fascinating although be aware that as the book is now 90 years old some of the details about the taxonomy have changed. In particular the Ural-Altaic family (which is the one that most interests me) has seen many new proposals in the last few decades.<br /><br />As someone here already noted Sapir is especially good with the Amerindian language groups and languages, which have their own interesting characteristics (Sapir once said that the Dene language \\"...is the most fascinating of all languages ever invented\\"), and Sapir was especially knowledgeable about the Athabaskan subgroup of Amerindian languages. In college Sapir took academic courses on Gothic, Old High German, Old Saxon, Icelandic, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, and Celtic, and in his field career studied many Amerindian languages including Navajo, Nootka, Takelma, Wishram Chinook, Yana, Ute, Paiute and Southern Paiute, Chasta Costa and Yana.<br /><br />The book reflects Sapir's interest in the comparative approach to language, and in how language influences culture and human psychology. Sapir was one of the pioneers in ethnolinguistics and he is still famous today for the Whorf-Sapir linguistic relativity theory which he developed with his student Benjamin Lee Whorf. This is one of the true classics in linguistics and still serves a useful purpose today as a basic intro. I think every speaker of English and certainly every high school and college English teacher should at least read Sapir's book, since if all you know is English or even several Germanic or Romance languages, you still don't know language very well since all Indo-European languages have many features in common and don't represent the full range of phonetics, morphology, grammar, and syntax that can be used to construct a language.<br /><br />After reading this book my favorite recommendation for a good intro theory book that isn't that long, overly technical, and approachable for the layman is John Lyons' wonderful book, Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics. Unfortunately it's out of print but you can find used copies from Amazon's associates. It's well worth acquiring if you can find a used copy in good condition. But after reading Lyons's book you should be in excellent shape and able to go on to even more technical theory books if you want.once said that the Dene language \\"...is the most fascinating of all languages ever invented\\"), and Sapir was especially knowledgeable about the Athabaskan subgroup of Amerindian languages.

0142405809|5.0|My son has loved this book since he was 2 years old... he is now 5, and it is still a favorite!  Other books have come and gone, but this one is still frequently requested as bedtime reading.  (It's also one of the few books I haven't gotten completely sick of reading aloud!)  It is a really sweet story about travel, a love of adventure, and - most of all - friendship.  The illustrations are lovely, and rhyme scheme is very clever.
0811879542|5.0|This book is so fun! The book starts out with a single dot and instructs the reader to &#34;Press Here&#34;...from there, the book takes the reader on an interactive journey where the dots change colors, multiply, rearrange themselves, turn lights on and off, and shift to different areas of the page, all prompted by the reader.<br />This book is great for teaching young children cause and effect and also how to follow directions. It briefly teaches patterning as well, which my three year old loved.<br />This book amazed my son from the first time we read it, and has quickly become one of our bedtime favorites.
0515153656|5.0|This was a test, and it passed, so I will buy the whole Jack Reacher series.<br />I bought it because of the movie about Jack Reacher.  I wanted to know more about this character
0757302661|5.0|I knew going into my second pregnancy that I wanted a natural childbirth. I took general childbirth classes when I was pregnant with my first child and they did very little to prepare me for labor and delivery. I had heard great things about HypnoBirthing, so I decided that was the method I would try. I looked into Hypnobirthing classes, but the nearest class to where I live was an hour and a half from my house-too far! So I decided to just buy this book and see if I liked it, then make a decision about whether or not classes were necessary when I was finished.<br /><br />Well, I got the book, and procrastinated reading it until I was 6 months pregnant. I read this book while floating on a raft in my pool over the course of a couple of days, certainly not dedicating the studying time to it that I probably should have. The whole beginning of the book is just touting the benefits of natural childbirth and the history of HypnoBirthing. I found it very interesting, however, since I had already purchased this book, I was obviously already interested in natural birth and had an idea about HypnoBirthing. For someone who purchased this book without any prior knowledge of natural birth benefits, this part of the book would undoubtedly be eye opening. My husband found this part of the book very interesting, and although he was already a supporter of natural birth, it convinced him further that we were making the right decision.<br /><br />The book listed several relaxation and visualization techniques, some for individual use, some for partner use. We found many of the partner guided exercises to be kind of hokey/cheesey and not something that I would like to use, but I did enjoy the visualization exercises, particularly the one where you are instructed to imagine that your uterus is covered with ribbons that are pulling when you have contractions, and also the one where you imagine dilation to be a blooming flower.<br /><br />This book also came with a CD that contained tworelaxation scripts. I dutifully listened to them at least once a day for 6 weeks before my due date. I fell asleep every time, except one, so evidently they were quite effective at relaxing me!<br /><br />I woke up in labor on my due date, and immediately listened to my Hypnobabies scripts in an effort to go back to sleep. I was too excited to sleep, but listening to the scripts definitely kept me calm. I labored at home all day, going about my normal activities, including care of my toddler, going on a 2 mile walk, and cleaning my house. I did not feel pain at all, just pressure. I was so pain-free that I wasn't even sure I was definitely in labor, but my husband and I decided to send our toddler to my parents' house \\"just in case\\" we ended up giving birth. At 10pm, I took a bath, and listened to my HypnoBirthing scripts again. By 11pm, I was certain that I was in labor and my contractions were a little more painful, but nothing major. We left for the hospital at 11:30pm, I listened to my scripts again in the car. They did not completely eliminate my pain, but definitely made it more manageable. We arrived at the hospital at 12:10am. When I walked in, my doctor saw me and clearly did not think I was in advanced labor. She took her time getting the exam room set up to check for labor progress before admitting me. She examined me 15 minutes later, to find that I was fully dilated and about to deliver my baby. My baby was born 15 minutes later, unmedicated, in the caul, with no pushing, just breathing and letting my body naturally deliver my baby. My baby nursed shortly after birth, and I was up walking around within an hour of birth. I felt amazing, and my recovery was almost instant compared to my previous birth (past due, failed natural induction, pitocin induction, baby in distress, epidural, narrowly avoided c-section).<br /><br />I can honestly say that just reading the positive stories about other natural births in this book, and reading about the positive effects of natural (NORMAL) birth, helped me tremendously. The scripts were worth it to me alone, since they helped actually get me through my labor. My labor was virtually pain free for over 20 hours of my 21 hour labor. Those 45 minutes were not painless, but they were made much more manageable by knowing what to expect. I imagine that if I hadn't been so lazy about practicing all of the other relaxation exercising, I could have achieved a painless birth, and that is something I will absolutely try for if I am fortunate enough to have a third child.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I bought this to use with the DVDO Edge, which I bought a year or two ago, and it works perfectly (using the optical connection). Pulling power via USB from an Xbox 360 with no problems.<br /><br />Just for kicks, I tried playing a Blu-ray with a Dolby 5.1 audio stream and it works fine. I assume the DVDO Edge automatically converts the Dolby signal to a regular 2-channel stream. In any case, audio's just as clear and crisp no matter which audio source I try.<br /><br />Seems like it's made out of high quality materials, though I don't really care since it's thrown in the back of a cabinet anyway.
B00797MB0O|4.0|Theron is excellent in this movie as a woman in the midst of a nervous breakdown. Her character is so unlikeable, yet realistic, and despite her horrible personality you can't help feeling sorry for her.<br /><br />At the age of 37 author Mavis Gary finds that she has hit a wall. Her young adult series has been cancelled, she's divorced and clearly suffering from depression. She self-medicates with alcohol and fast food, and comes up with a \\"brilliant\\" plan to win back her high school boyfriend Buddy - not because she never got over him but because he is associated with the happiest time in her life when she was popular and admired by all.<br /><br />That should tell you a lot about the type of person Mavis is. Shallow, spoiled and vain, she is unprepared when life doesn't go her way. Instead of dealing with disappointment like an actual adult and growing from it she tries to relive the past. Sadly for her though her journey back to her home town only makes her unhappier. She can't believe that the people she grew up with could be so content with so little while someone as fabulous as her is unfulfilled. She especially despises Buddy's sweet wife, a woman who is the opposite of her in every way, but who Buddy adores.<br /><br />When she stumbles upon Matt, one of the losers from her high school that she wouldn't have deigned to speak to back then they form an unlikely friendship. Matt is permanently damaged from a violent attack in high school, and his sarcasm and raw honesty are exactly what Mavis needs. He shows her the dark side of the high school world that she longs to return to, and even manages to get a few glimmers of humanity from her. It's not enough to prevent her spiral into self-destruction and there is no neat ending where she learns the errors of her ways because it's not that kind of movie (I wanted to punch Matt's sister when she tells her she doesn't need to change). I know some people don't believe it's a comedy but I did find it very funny in a dark way. It was also extremely cringe-inducing and at times I couldn't bear to watch. An unusual combination of black comedy and pathos. Unlike Mavis this movie is a winner.

1469984202|4.0|First off, Wool is five stars for an indie self-pub. Howey deserves all the praise he's received for this collection and I can't wait to read more from him. That being said, Wool is not without it's flaws. The first book is five stars and a must-read, but the second installment meandered a bit and slogged until the surprise ending. After that, the third book rocketed back into action and the mystery kept building through the forth and fifth installments. However, an inclusion of characters in the end felt illogical and forced, as if they were only used to amp up the tension. This, along with a slightly dissatisfying ending, were the only flaws in an otherwise stellar tale. Still, don't let this minor nitpicking detract anyone from reading this awesome series, since Wool is a terrific post-apocalyptic thriller.

B00BGI076M|1.0|This TV series must be the WORST on TV at the moment.<br /><br />The plot - too ridiculous to say the least. This psycho is so 'clever' that he has managed to make a bunch of fools to do his dirty work. What's more, the FBI are even more STUPID than this psycho's apprentice. With all the resources at their disposal, the FBI just keep messing things up.<br /><br />There are countless 'unreasonable' and 'ridiculous' plots...one just stands out the most so far is the psycho's lawyer. After having two of her fingers chopped off by one of his henchmen, she continues to help Joe because she is 'scare'??? Ah... she is a lawyer, right? She is supposed to be smart, right? And, has she even called the police? No...And in any case, she goes to the prison, shaking with fears I might add, and does as Joe asks. Seriously?<br /><br />The plot is just too 'perfect'...It is almost like knowing what is going to happen and then go backwards to complete the gaps.<br /><br />The writer is a complete moron and I don't even want to comment why there are so many people who give this show 5 stars... If it was up to me (and had a choice), I would give this stupid show zero star!<br /><br />Check out some of the comments from other like-minded individuals - they have all already said what I wanted to say.<br /><br />The first episode is kind of intense, but it deteriorates preciptiously thereafter. Being open-minded, we watched a couple more. Well, yesterday my wife and I watched this utterly idiotic TV series for the last time.

0345535421|5.0|Great follow up to Game of thrones. Couldn't put the book down until I finished it. If you like the tv series then buy the book! This book follows season 2 of the tv series. This book is a little different from season 2 (25% different I'd guess). The main plot elements are still there but there's a great more context for the characters that the show doesn't dive into. Also again I love the flashbacks that fill in the blanks for key events for many of the main characters.

0452295548|4.0|According to the American Heart Association, between 1999 and 2009 the relative rate of stroke death fell by 37% and the actual number of stroke deaths declined by 23%. Still, stroke is a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Jill Bolte Taylor, Ph.D., is a neuroanatomist who is currently affiliated with the Indiana University School of Medicine. At a young age Taylor was drawn to a career in neurobiology by a fascination with her brother's schizophrenia. At the age of 35 Taylor was elected, as the youngest board member ever, to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) where her brother's schizophrenia still played a large role in her career. Working with NAMI Taylor realized that there was a large gap between the amount of brains needed for mental illness research and the amount of brains being donated by those suffering from a mental illness. This realization led Taylor to her work with the Harvard Brain Bank, of which she is currently the national spokesperson.<br /> While working for the Harvard Brain Bank Taylor suffered from a rare type of stroke which required risky surgery to offer her the chance of returning to \\"normal.\\" After eight years of hard work Taylor felt that she had fully recovered in every aspect. Since her recovery Taylor has started her own non-profit Brains, Inc., which promotes education, awareness, and appreciation of the human brain. My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey earns four out of five stars because Taylor does a very good job making sure the reader understands the science behind her situation through visual aids, simple language, and through defining terms that may be unfamiliar to her audience while also providing a human element, making for a great read.<br /> Taylor clearly illustrates from a neuroanatomist's view, both the fascinating and frightening aspects of strokes. Taylor goes into detail about the different parts of the brain and how they relate to one another as well as the rest of the body. She also describes in detail the different types of strokes and how they can occur. As Taylor explains, her stroke was a rare form due to an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or simply, an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. Where arteries meet veins, blood goes from high pressure to low pressure. In order for the blood to safely go from high pressure in an artery to the low pressure in a vein a capillary acts as a buffer. Taylor explains that AVMs in the brain can easily burst because AVMs lack a capillary bed to act as a buffer between the vein and artery. Taylor even provides a visual aid of what this connection looks like for someone with an AVM and another figure of a normal ateriovenous formation so the reader can compare the two. When the AVM bursts blood flows into the brain and can have devastating, life threatening effects and is then classified as a stroke. This is just one of many examples of how Taylor ensures that the reader understands the science behind her situation through visual aids, simple language, and defining terms that they may be unfamiliar with.<br /> Taylor recalls the morning of her stroke vividly and with a sense of wonder, which is why it is both interesting and disturbing. While blood began to spill out into the different areas of her brain different functions were effected and Taylor makes sure to explain, using diagrams and simple language, what area of her brain is being affected every step of the way. For example, when Taylor cannot remember a phone number to call for rescue she helps the reader to understand this in terms of neuroanatomy. Because Taylor's stroke occurred on the left side of her brain, where the brain processes numerical information, she basically lost her entire concept of what numbers were. I found it very interesting to read about the specialization of the different areas in the brain as they related to the progressing symptoms of Taylor's stroke. While being extremely informative on the anatomy and function of the brain regions, Taylor also expresses her wonderment at her own brain in what can only be described as a transcendent and ethereal way. I enjoyed this aspect of the book because although neuroscience can sometimes seem to explain away the human experience, Taylor focused on her feelings in a near death experience in a knowledgeable way that still conveyed just how amazing our brains truly are.<br /> Another interesting aspect of this book is Taylor's complete recovery. As Taylor explains, her attitude, knowledge of neuroplasticity, and mother/caregiver all played a large role in her successful recovery. However, Taylor fails to go into much depth about the concept and scientific support regarding neuroplasticity. She describes the process of retraining her brain and relearning certain things but a clear understanding of neuroplasticity is never unestablished. Instead she focuses on the large role her mother played as her caregiver. While this is touching, it fails to address the neuroscience behind her recovery. I agree that a strong support system is key to recovery but because neurons do not grow back once they die I was really looking forward to Taylor's explanation of how, scientifically, she made a full recovery. With how much Taylor's AVM bled when it burst she is very lucky to have been able to make a full recovery and she leaves the reader wanting more information on how her recovery was possible. Despite overlooking the scientific aspect of Taylor's recovery, I was not disappointed with the book which proved to be a very compelling and interesting read.<br /> While explaining each and every step of her brain functions ceasing and then fully recovering, Taylor manages to keep the reader amazed at the beauty of brain function. She does this by pointing out what part of her brain was effected by her stroke and how it caused certain symptoms, like the motor cortex and her inability to lift her right arm. Visual aids and basic definitions help the reader to understand and appreciate the complexity of the human brain. Her recovery is inspirational. People take for granted that their brain controls literally everything about them from their heartbeat to their personalities. Reading this book helps you to realize how interesting and important your brain is and how often it is overlooked.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is an amazing app because minecraft fans everywhere can now play minecraft on the go.  I love minecraft.  The computer addition is way better but its not portable.  One frusterating thing is on the minecraft forums mojang (the company that invented minecraft) keeps saying their going to make updates but they keep on pushing the updates back.  Overall defanentally get this game its very entertaining.

1401235417|5.0|Scott Synder knows how to write Batman. As far as most reboots go, writers tend to reuse old character plots and villains to make their job a bit easier. This is not the case with New 52 Batman. A new villain has emerged, an entity known as the Court of Owls. The myth of their involvement in the history of Gotham is extremely interesting and adds a few new twists on the story you thought you always knew.<br /><br />Prepare for some surprises, but some good ones. This is one of my favorite Batman stories yet. The whole mystery behind the existence of the Owls is very eerie and done extremely well. It gives a good chance for the writer to show Batman's infamous detective skills, which seem to be lacking in the recent movies.<br /><br />The story starts 'in media res' but it will be easy for any casual Batman fan to get into. It does a good job of explaining itself and will be a great experience for those new and familiar with the Batman. The writing is fantastic, the art is very well-detailed, and I can't find anything I don't like about this comic book. Let's just say I had to read it in one sitting (it was that good).<br /><br />Excited to read the second volume when it comes out in paperback. Get this comic. I don't care if you're a Batman fan or not. If you aren't, this comic will turn you into one.

B00C7KYXHW|4.0|This show is addicting, and I have been catching up with episodes online. The acting is top notch, in my untrained opinion, and the plot is, well, interesting. However, I hesitate to give to it 5 stars because it is a bit too graphic. I think it could still have the shock value the writers are seeking even if they pull back a little from the blood and gore.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|After trying several calendar apps that really stunk or required upgrade purchases. This app rocks! Easy to use and easy set important calendar dates. It is perfect for someone who has lots of dates to keep track of. It has very useful features like icons add and yearly repeat dates like birthdays and anniversaries. The Best app by a mile!!!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was so excited to read this book...and sad knowing it was the end of Sookie and Bon Temps. But honestly it was awful closure to an amazing series! I felt Charlaine's heart just wasn't in it anymore and she just threw it together. I read it in one day and couldn't believe that was it. It was an awful plot in my opinion and was chapter after chapter of Sookie cooking! And Eric was just gone?? I'm sorry but this just wasn't the ending this great series required and I hoped for. Totally bummed :(
B007L3BMGA|5.0|The misses  absolutely loved this book and  was quite intent on reading the whole series of fifty shades.of grey Cheers
B000W93CHC|5.0|I was reading this book and it disappeared from my Kindle - It does not show up on my home page.  Please resend it so I can continue reading it.  Thanks, Maude
B00BIVN82M|5.0|here he is with new songs and great band ,,,, long awaited  thoroughly enjoying  for those who love Michael B  this is IT
B000FVE3AC|5.0|I absolutely love the watch. I've always loved the diver design with blue face and blue dial bezel. I used to own a Casio diver watch and an Armitron diver watch, but they both don't compare to this watch. I had to pop out the pins to remove two links because the watch was too big for my wrist. After putting the pins back in, the watch fits just right. The only disadvantage I have after putting the pins back in is that often the stainless steel brace will come apart from watch because it's obvious that one of the pins is not inserted right or I might have stripped it. Other than that, I love the watch; glad I purchased it at a great deal.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I've played the game before, so I know I like it, but as soon as I open it and the game loads, it closes! I'm gonna be super duper angry if I wasted money on this.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like this app. I got it because it shows the list of calculations, which is what I need when balancing check book, etc. I gave it 4 stars only because I have not had it for very long.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Was using a different app<br />This one is far superior!  Play for hours on end.  Love the sound effects, too.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This app is very fun! it can get quite addicting though soso be warned. a goods game tknllay when there's nothing else to do.
B004856SQ8|5.0|Takes me back to my youth watching this great movie. If you are an A-Team fan, this is a must have movie!!!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I have been using my note books for about a week. I would like it better if I could underline or highlight some of my sentences or words, but am still very happy with this app over-all. I may never have to carry around a paper notebook again.  I haven't tried any other notebook apps. This one was free!
193700788X|3.0|My review can also be found on my blog, tomesdevotee.blogspot.com.  I found this book ok.  It certainly wasn't an out of the park homerun, but, it wasn't the absolute disaster many are making it out to be.  I loved how all her friends past and present gathered together to help her in the latest jam she finds herself.<br /><br />Sookie is accused of murder.  Someone is setting her up big time, the question is who, and why are<br />they doing it.  In the middle of that mess, her vampire boyfriend is not happy with her, nor she him.  Her friend and co-owner of Merlottes, Sam is behaving odd to say the least.  When this is all said and done will she have either one in her life anymore?  The only staple seems to be good ole' Bill.<br />********<br />STOP HERE TO NOT HAVE THE BOOK RUINED IF THAT MATTERS TO YOU!!!!<br />********<br /><br />Now for the controversy and what ticked me and hundreds of others.  First let me say that I called it when I read the last book, I think most of us did.  I love Eric.  He is an unapologetic, egotistical, megalomaniacal, ruthless killer.  We all know that about him, and yet we all still love him.  CASE CLOSED!!!  It doesn't bother me, I don't care one bit about that.  Why you ask? Because through each book you learn that Eric does love Sookie.  Did he do what he had to to get her, yup, but HE LOVES HER.  When she was tortured and mutilated by the fairies and he held her hand and she asked him \\"why didn't you come?\\"  His answer was \\"You're killing me.\\"  It was a tortured and wretched angst filled response to her because he loves her so.  Their relationship has been sown slowly through each book lovingly crafted, and for the author to calously toss it away like gum on the bottom of ones shoe sucked a big smelly pickle to say the least!<br /><br />In my opinion Harris was not happy with the devotion that her fans of this series have given to Eric. Not even Bill has the same level of adoration.  She point blank said in an interview that it baffles her how he is loved because he is a BAD guy plain and simple.  That Sam was her answer all along I personally find disingenuous.  There was never the same level of attraction for Sookie with Sam than there was with any of her boyfriends, even Alcide had more zing with Sook.  It would have been an easier pill to swallow if she would have had Sookie just be by herself and live her life.<br /><br />How insulting to have a relationship that has been nurtured through several books be cast away with barely an explanation.  Eric is almost non-existent in this story and man that just is so out of character for the whole series and the personality of the characters.  Where was the angst, the heartbreak, the anger over this by both of them!?!  I felt more hurt amd pain when Eric forced Bill to tell her he was using her while she lay in that New Orleans hospital bed.  Sookie's gut wrenching pain was soooo thick in that one scene that I cried, but not here, not with Eric.<br /><br />Oh well I guess this is what happens to loyal fans with some authors.  Her paltry explanation at the begining of the book that she knows not all will be happy is just meaningless.  You can't please everyone, I think we as adults know and accept that, but please don't insult us, those who have bought every single solitary book, pre-ordering them, getting them signed and keeping them as a treasure to not give away to anyone.  We all were short changed here, those of us who have come to love our Blonde Viking and it hurts, it hurts bad. To those who think we're crazy and say get a life, a pox on you and  your ancestors.<br /><br />And now comes the next screwing over with True Blood on HBO, this has become a torturous adventure of disgust as I watch beloved characters get twisted into things they never were and even dumber storylines.  I need a drink....<br /><br />3 Stars  Because it wasn't the worst I've ever read (that award goes to The Gathering) even though she has SUPREMELY pissed me off.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Little corny but Ilikes it.  Would recommend for fun.  Can be completed quickly without too much troouble.  The story isn't bad.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|It enlightens about history of how two wars came about, and explains a lot the factors that are more complex than the simple historical summary most people carry in their minds The books do so in a very engaging story of both fictional characters and the important real historical people. Good historical fiction at it's best is a better and more humanly accurate recount of history than non fiction and Ken Follett is a leading practitioner along with James Michener.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I really didn't like this app.  Ther wasn't much of a story to it, just looked around a room and hadto figure out what you needed to do next.  Very dark
B005L38QK2|5.0|Pros:<br />- Comfortable mouse<br />- Sweet D3 logo and pulsates RED<br />- Built very well, construction is top notch<br />- Braided cord makes for a durable mouse<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Software bundled is not very good, having a hard time remapping buttons<br />- Build for both left and right handed people, annoying.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|The waste toner container was shipped on time as promised. The packaging was what you would find on the store. The installation was simple using the enclosed instructions. Total install time was 5 minutes. This was a very good investment and will keep the printer running for many more years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game cuz it gives me the satisfaction of owning a horse and taking care of it.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|At first the game was sooooooooo fun and addicting but after a month or 2 it was the most boring app ever.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|It took me awhile to get into this one but about 15% of the way through I was hooked.  The setting and history that Rothfuss lays out is novel and interesting and the main character is well fleshed out.  There is also a cast of interesting minor characters, some of whom suffer from a touch of one-dimensionality but it's not too distracting.<br /><br />Note also that this is not a standalone book.  As the title implies, it only takes you through the opening chapters of our hero's heroic tale.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|THIS IS A TIMELESS MOVIE WITH A GREAT MUSICAL SCORE!  IT WAS GREAT WHEN IT CAME OUT AND STILL IS!
B000TGGJKK|1.0|would not play.  I will return it & try a new one hoping the replacement will work very, very  well.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|THIS IS A QUALITY SHOW, MISSED THE FIRST SEASON SO I'M HAPPY TO CATCH UP!  IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE HOW ALICIA HAS GROWN AS A CHARACTER!
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|It looks pretty and the physics are good but controlling movement, aiming, and shooting is difficult and takes the fun out of it.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I use this all the time and really like it, makes me feel like my kindle is safe from scratches
B008RF0M9O|5.0|The title of this review is an allusion to a vinyl recording from the pre-CD age. I bought some Sony MDR-V6 headphones almost concurrently as I purchased the afore-mentioned LP. I paid nearly $100.00 for the headphones. At that time, they were expensive, but worth every penny. They are still my favorite cans.<br /><br />The original ear pads have been defunct for more than a decade. The pittance I paid for these replacement pads have restored the circumaural seal and restored the bass response to its incredible depth and precision. Prior to buying these miracle ears, I was going to pop for a new set of MDR-V6s. Today, I can get them for about $65.00 (in 2013 dollars).<br /><br />I am sure if the new Sonys match the specs and performance of my 30 year old model, then they are the best deal you will ever find. These new ear pads saved me at least $55.00 and have made it possible for my original Sony headphones to operate until I am relegated to sitting and listening to the Beatific Vision for eternity (assuming there is no intermission and we must sit and stare all day).
B007PF7MGS|4.0|I love reading books about nutrition/health/weight loss and I am a big fan of Dr. McDougall (I am also a longtime vegan). I thought the book was very interesting and included information I had not heard before. I wish everyone who follows a low-carb diet would read this book!!

B004TI1WME|5.0|I've actually used the free version of this calculator for quite a while, but the ads got to be too annoying and distracting so I just recently deleted it to use a different one. But I really liked the tape feature on this simple calculator. Delighted to see it on FAOTD!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game! It's very addicting!  It is hard for me to quit playing, especially when it is bedtime! Have a great time playing this game and have a safe life!
B0053O89JM|5.0|Thanks guys for your fast service. I was surprised with your superb work! Keep up the good work and I'll be ordering more DVD from you guys!
