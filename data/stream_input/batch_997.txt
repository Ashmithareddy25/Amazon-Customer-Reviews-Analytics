B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is INSPIRATIONAL beyond words. A must see for everyone. Michael Oher is a GEM!!!!! He gives new meaning to the terms inspirational, fighter, and driven person.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Just got the opening day release of A[[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray].  Right out of the box it would not play on my LG blu-ray player.  A little reseach showed that it is a DRM problem with LG and Samsung Players.  A message tells me I need a firmware update.  No one at Blu-ray seems to know what to do, so I have a nice shiny Drink coaster and I can't return it because its been opened. The DVD version works just fine; the effects are fantastic, the story, you've seen it before in any number of action adventure movies.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This movie is a must see for all those who are thinking about entering the military, so they can truly see what they are going to endure and lose. It is also a must see believers for all of us, who need to see why we need to support our troops, whether we agree with the war or not.
B000002GXS|4.0|I am not an avid fan of TW, however, this one will get under your skin. Not all of the songs are sad, but they are the musings of a solitary man looking at life through a beer glass. When listening to this, you get the feeling it's all just rhyming silly words. But I think that was the idea, to get you to laugh at him, with him, at life. Be forewarned, this is not TW the mad sound scientist of the blues. This is TW sitting behind the piano, with cigarette ash burning and stand up bassist in the backround. Put this one on on a quiet night at home, sipping red wine, reading a good book. Should get you in the mood.

0937381888|5.0|This book explains brewing in great detail but is still easy to understand.  My beers have improved a lot just from reading the first few chapters.  It is easier to brew better beer when you know why things happen the way they do.    Thanks JP!
B00005JGAF|4.0|Got my cd as part of a '2 in 1' set, with their self-titled debut. Fortunately the guitars are up in the mix, compared to their debut album, where they seem to have been told to \\"Shhh!\\"...perhaps by the studio or something. So, at least on this album you get to hear punk guitar like it was meant to be heard. Whilst not having commercially accessible pop-punk as found in their debut, or pop-punk classic \\"End of the century\\", this is nonetheless a solid album. If you get recent releases of their 2nd album (\\"Leave home\\") you get some good live versions of many songs off of their debut album...and the guitars are up in the mix for them, which is cool. Anyway, my cd has the 14 original album tracks, plus 5 bonus tracks, some of demo quality, as well as single versions of songs on this album. Two songs betray a punk influence working the other way...from England to the Ramones, who are credited as founding punk (though I would give Australian punk act The Saints equal top billing with the Ramones on that score). Those two songs are \\"We're a happy family\\" and the next song on the album, \\"Teenage lobotomy\\".      Best song:      Slug - a bonus track and in demo form. This should song should have made it on to their hits compilation in my view. A catchy, boppy song.      Next best songs:      Here today, gone tomorrow - a slower tempo song. Sing-along-able.    We're a happy family - ironic and sarcastic in tone. About a dysfunctional family. The outro has Joey singing in a faux English accent...the next track on the album has this too...part of that English punk influence I mentioned in the header.    I wanna be well - catchy, sing-along-able song which has drug references.      Most of the rest:      Cretin hop - bassy, guitars up in the mix for the album opener...a good sign!    Rockaway Beach - sort of a Beach Boys style song. Some lyrics are similar to \\"Rock'n'roll High School\\" which features in their later album \\"End of the century\\".    I don't care - very similar totheir debut's \\"Judy is a punk\\". Made me wonder if I got the wrong track on the debut album. Has a sort of grungy guitar sound quality to it.    Sheena is a punk rocker - another song which reminds one of \\"Rock'n'roll High School\\". Features hand claps.     Teenage lobotomy - has English punk vocal vowels. Bassy, with an interesting drum intro.    I can't give you anything - has acoustic guitar strumming. Catchy.    Ramona - has some sweet and smooth backing vocals.    Surfin' bird - hard sound with some good scat singing.     Why is always this way - about suicide.    Needles and pins - bonus track. An early version of their covering this song. Seems to dip momentarily into mono.    It's a long way back to Germany - has a familiar guitar pattern at the start...Nirvana do something like that?    I don't care - bonus track. The single version. Bassy, heavy metal type heavy and fuzzy guitar. Bass similar to The White Stripes' \\"7 nation army\\" lick.        Recommendations:      for Ramones:      Ramones - pop-punk is created before punk in the US. Has many of their best songs, like \\"53rd and 3rd\\" and \\"I wanna be your boyfriend\\".    End of the century - has their best pop-punk material, like \\"Rock'n'roll High School\\", \\"Chinese rock\\" and \\"Danny says\\".      for hard punk:      The Saints - (I'm) Stranded. The most seminal punk pioneering album in my view...seems to presage speed and thrash metal at times too. Not much pop-punk on this album.    Stiff Little Fingers - Inflammable material. One of only two 5/5 albums for me. Great punk from Ireland. The other 5/5 punk album for me is The Saints' \\"Eternally yours\\", which has some Nuggets' style pop on it as well as the greatest punk song of all time, in my view...\\"Know your product\\".    The Damned - Damned damned damned. First punk album by a British band. Of the pub-rock variety.      for art punk/rock:      Wire - Pink flag. Has elements of punk and the alternative band Elastica raided at least one song from Wire to do theirvariation on it...e.g. Wire's \\"Three girl rhumba\\" was transmogrified into Elastica's \\"Connection\\".    Wire - Chairs missing. Elastica might have raided another song from this album too...apparently it's \\"I am the fly\\", but I haven't heard what Elastica have done with it.    Wire - 154. Not punk anymore...art rock.    The Clash - London calling. Their best album. The album is more art rock to me than punk.    The Clash - Combat rock. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain lists this album in his top 50 records of all time. He also has The Saints' \\"Know your product\\" in that list too, though I think their entire album deserves such praise too.    Radio Birdman - Radios appear. Often called 'proto-punk' this Australian pioneer sound punk enough for me...but they do a line in jazzy type songs too...not unlike their heroes, The Stooges.      for proto-punk:      New York Dolls - New York Dolls. Maybe Ramones were influenced by them? Ramones did give 1960s pop the kind of twist that the Dolls did on their debut, at times.    Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers - L.A.M.F. Like Radio Birdman, these guys get labelled as 'proto-punk', but to me they sound punk enough. You first hear Dee Dee Ramones' song \\"Chinese rocks\\" on this album. Ramones did their version some years later on \\"End of the century\\" (as \\"Chinese rock\\").    The Stooges - The Stooges. Has their best songs on it. An influence on Ramones, who name check them on \\"Do you remember rock'n'roll radio?\\", I think...along with proto-metal band Blue Cheer...whose debut is very good too.
B00005JMCN|4.0|This story of 'Seabiscuit' is from Laura Hillenbrand's factual book about an insignificant racehorse who becomes legendary as a national hero, and about the lives he touches (and knits together) along the way.<br /><br />The film, directed by Gary Ross, is gripping. Although it is quite long (over two hours) and does take some time to develop the story, it tells a great story of the hopes, passions and dreams of people during the doom and gloom of the Great Depression.<br /><br />From a Self Development point of view there is much to enjoy about it. Take as just one example, the personal growth of the characters. The jockey (already blind in one eye) has a riding accident causing multiple leg fractures and is told he will never ride again. Yet through sheer determination he gets back on that horse using a contraption that allows him to take some weight on his legs again. In essence it is an exhilarating story of making a comeback every time you fall, in the broadest possible sense of the word `fall'.<br /><br />Along the lines of Personal Development the film has much to offer on life's many important lessons such as:<br /><br />* the restoration of broken lives<br />* the undying love for one's passions<br />* the importance of following one's dreams<br />* the exhilaration of being able get back up each time you fall<br /><br />There are sterling performances from the three characters the story focuses on who saw the famed horse to victory:<br /><br />* Chris Cooper - the trainer with an intriguing air<br />* Tobey Maguire - Seabiscuit's partially blind and fiery jockey<br />* Jeff Bridges - the resourceful owner still grieving from significant personal loss<br /><br />The supporting cast also gives some outstanding performances, such as Elizabeth Banks (like Tobey Maguire, of Spider-Man fame), Gary Stevens and William H Macey. These very different characters brought together by fate develop a deep bond between themselves which culminates in Seabiscuit being taken to various victories.<br /><br />The beauty of the cinematography is down to details such as the intertwining of black-and-white film with colour, the thrilling physical movement, the concentration on facial expressions and the script. Although the script has some cringing clich&eacute;s there are also gems such as:<br /><br />* \\"Every horse is good for something\\"<br />* (Pointing to the heart) \\"The desire to win is not in his legs; it's in here\\"<br />* \\"You don't throw your whole life away just because you're banged up a little\\"<br /><br />I also particularly like:<br /><br />* The craftsmanship of the sets and costumes<br />* The photography which is beautifully composed<br />* The filming of the actual racing which is very thrilling<br />* The clever use of lighting which adds to the drama of the storyline<br />* The music and the sound mixing which complements the film wonderfully<br /><br />'Seabiscuit' is most certainly not just for horseracing fans or people who love horses. It is far more than just a film about a horse. It is at its core about self growth, self empowerment, emotional health and emotional wealth. It is a great Hollywood film, entertaining to the widest audience including horse enthusiast and families.<br /><br />In a nutshell it is the story of people who have lost their way yet come out the other end with continued hope, joy and an undying passion for following their dreams.s such as the intertwining of black-and-white film with colour, the thrilling physical movement, the concentration on facial expressions and the script.

B00004RFFI|4.0|It's just one darn tornado after another.  Never saw such a storm system before.<br /><br />Twister is improbable.  Twister is maniacal.  It's a thrill ride that's guaranteed to hold your interest from beginning to end.  And how cool is it that Van Halen's Humans Being made it into the soundtrack?  It's a great tornado-chase song.<br /><br />I love Twister.  I'm into the whole midwest vibe it so effectively creates.  I love Helen Hunt. If Twister was a bad movie, I think I'd still watch it just to see her.  I love the effects - they are extremely effective!<br /><br />Some of the scripting is a bit cheesy, to be sure.<br /><br />For instance, the campy melodrama behind the following scene is just so yeesh:<br /><br />Joey: [Discussing at Meg's on the tornadoes they have seen so far] No, that was a good size twister. What was it, an F3?<br />Bill: Solid F2.<br />Melissa: See, now you have lost me again.<br />Bill: It's the Fujita scale. It measures a tornado's intensity by how much it eats.<br />Melissa: Eats?<br />Bill: Destroys.<br />Laurence: That one we encountered back there was a strong F2, possibly an F3.<br />Beltzer: Maybe we'll see some 4's.<br />Haynes: That would be sweet!<br />Bill: 4 is good. 4 will relocate your house very efficiently.<br />Melissa: Is there an F5?<br />[Everyone goes dead silent]<br />Melissa: What would that be like?<br />Jason 'Preacher' Rowe: The Finger of God.<br />Melissa: None of you has ever seen an F5?<br />Bill: ...Just one of us.<br />[Looks upstairs, indicating Jo]<br /><br />And speaking of cheesy, I don't like Bill Paxton as the leading man in this.  There's something overly contrived about him, almost to the point of being plastic.  But the other characters are fairly interesting.<br /><br />Especially, of course, Helen Hunt. :-)

This books gives a rather good strategy, but it shouldn't be used alone for preparation. BTW, I got 8 score at the exam!

B002ZG98VE|1.0|I'm fed up with Hollywood's politically-correct nonsense and demand some historical correctness.  I will NEVER spend money for this movie!  I love Kate but the idea that she is in armor and swinging a sword is ludicrous.  Women in those days didn't do that sort of thing.  (And please don't point to Joan of Arc, who was an aberration.)  It's time to recognize that until just a few years ago women were never in this sort of position.  I'll wait and take this movie from the TV, if I watch it at all.

B002VECM4A|4.0|For as many flaws as a film like `Precious' possesses, they all almost seem moot when you consider the emotional weight that this film carries.  You cannot help but walk away from `Precious' feeling a small part of your soul readjusted.  Like Miss Winfrey has mentioned on numerous occasions, `Precious' is a film that makes the audience aware of something they may have so often ignored; the fact that there are precious children the world over in need of something they are not receiving.<br /><br />If this film doesn't leave you in tears, then I don't know what will.<br /><br />`Precious' tells the story of Clarice `Precious Jones', a morbidly obese sixteen year old who is pregnant with her second child by her abusive father.  She is illiterate, reclusive, and continually berated and degraded by her mother Mary, a monstrous woman who blames Precious for her own dire circumstances.  When Precious is expelled from school for being pregnant she winds up at an alternative school where she meets Ms. Rain, a caring teacher who sees something in Precious that Precious doesn't see herself; hope.  While her circumstances won't fix themselves, and they won't go away overnight, Precious discovers within herself the will and the strength to make that first step towards something ultimately better for herself and for her two children.<br /><br />There are holes within the storyline that make it hard at times to really wrap your head around.  Precious' life is horrific, but the way the film is edited at times dulls the atrocities.  I really think that all the faults here are left on director Lee Daniels' shoulders.  As much as Mo'Nique praised Lee up and down for his `vision', it is his vision that clouds out this films true potential.  The way he pollutes a seemingly vile situation with obnoxious fantasy sequences is rather off-putting.  The film becomes very heavy-handed, with properly placed symbols to tell us (the audience) how we are supposed to feel and what conclusions we are supposed to draw.  Instead of allowing the grit and the drama to speak for itself, Lee fell into the trap of over thinking everything.<br /><br />But, where he fails the actors here truly shine.<br /><br />All the hype surrounding the performances by Mo'Nique, Gabourey Sidibe and Mariah Carey are legit and deserved.  These three performances (in a sea of very well thought out and natural performances) are commanding and memorable; three of the best of the decade.  Sidibe (this is her first film) is heartbreakingly real as Precious.  You can feel her soul dividing as she tries to make sense of her dire straits.  She is alone and broken and desperately searching for a reason to survive.  Her eyes, sunken into her callous face, tell a story that is so reaching and so heartfelt one cannot help but be taken in entirely by it.  Mariah Carey, unrecognizable for sure, is also noteworthy here.  She has a few short scenes, but she truly maneuvers herself right into each frame, understanding how overwhelming her eventual understanding is going to be.  That final scene, where Mo'Nique sealed her Oscar win, gives us a better understanding of what knowledge can do to a person.  The way she latterly crumbles as she receives answers to questions she was required to ask; it was unnerving.<br /><br />But, we should all take a moment to bask in the glory of Mo'Nique.  I'm not even going to get into the whole \\"who knew she could pull THIS off?\\" thing because this performance is too good to be degraded by that line of thinking.  Mo'Nique, quite frankly, delivers the best supporting performance of the decade.  This was, easily, my favorite Oscar win of the decade as well.  While one may rashly call her depiction of the monster Mary as generic and or clich&eacute;d, one only needs to watch the layers stripped away in that gut-wrenching final scene to see that there is nothing generic about this performance.  Mo'Nique manages to layer Mary with an awareness that comes from experience.  She understood this woman.  She made sure that when we saw her, we not only saw the evil things she was capable of, but we saw the pain and desperation that shaped and formed her.  We also so a little bit of Precious in her as well.  We never condone, but we begin to understand how Precious became Mary, and the unsettling truth behind that `circle of life' starts to kick in and we see the urgency in Precious taking reins and making her life better.<br /><br />We see the future.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, `Precious' is flawed.  The script has holes and the direction is not as refined as it needed to be.  Daniels was a tad green for this.  In the end, he delivered a stunning and memorable film, but he is the films weakest link.  The acting, the message, the atmosphere and authentic cinematography make this a truly noteworthy film, one that is definitely worth your time and attention.  Sadly, it doesn't connect all the dots.  Moments like the rape scene, the overlaying of bouncy music on black screens of abusive moaning, the carefully placed messages that are all too obvious (that `Two Women' reference itself was misplaced, misapplied and terribly distracting); they all take away (even if it is `ever so slightly') from the film for me.<br /><br />I do want to mention that this film is an extreme.  Some take the `so true' statements too literally.  This film is not about an obese, abused, illiterate, poor black girl; this film is about a girl who was never truly loved.  That is the `so true' part.he understood this woman.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|This film is 4-stars not 5, but its primary success is exemplary: portraying the pain of a guy whose girl remains elusive.  Such a role reversal is uncommon for the modern chick flick, but it's not played just for that novelty -- it's played for the reality of the emotion involved.  500DoS should be required viewing for women whose experiences have them believing men incapable of caring.  Tom cares - and pays, and pays, and pays.      SPOILER: I thought the ending was more than a bit of a cheat. I don't remember what \\"Day number\\" (post-Summer) ended the film, but a guy like Tom would probably grieve quite awhile before reaching out toward a new girl (particularly a stranger), and even after he started again, his first few such advances would probably fail.  To give him a quickie happy ending, starting off again post-Summer with a shot at a new relationship, felt tacked-on.

Fabulous series best appreciated if you start from season 1 for the back story and to understand the cast of characters (an episode with Dean returning to the past will fill in some of these details nicely)however Season 4 stands very well on its own with Dean returning from the depths of hell. Each episode moves the storyline along with plots that range from 4-10 on the creeped out scale.  And of course the boys are fabulous!

0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis is an engaging writer with the ability to find drama in unexpected situations. This book is his take on the great sub-prime meltdown of 2008 which gave us the worst recession in decades. Lewis has an unusual hook for his story: instead of telling it from the point of view of those who caused the crisis, he finds a small number of misfits who saw it coming and bet on housing prices collapsing. Each of these voices in the wilderness ended up wealthy beyond most of our dreams.<br /><br />Lewis clearly illustrates the collective madness that gripped Wall Street in the years leading up to the collapse. Financiers built an entire house of cards on the premise that you could lend money to people to buy houses they could not afford and that they would never default on these loans. It was a Ponzi scheme that depended on housing prices going up by 10 percent or more year after year.<br /><br />Everyone in the system was dishonest: the wizards who created more and more arcane financial instruments to make extremely risky loans -- loans that were virtually certain to default -- look like triple A bonds. Then there were the salespeople who sold these loans to unsuspecting suckers. Then the rating agencies who took money from the investment banks and rated everything triple A without even examining what these bond actually consisted of. Lewis profiles one of these crooks who earned $45 million in a single year selling crap. His operation went bust of course and lost billions but he got to keep his own money.<br /><br />Lewis's group of naysayers all stood out for being social misfits of one kind or another who marched to their own drummers. Lewis is brilliant in painting these idiosyncratic characters who refused to rush over the cliff with the other lemmings.<br /><br />One notable exclusion in the book: Lewis doesn't tell the story of hedge fund manager John Paulson who went to Goldman Sachs to help structure and market a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) that he could bet against that would be guaranteed to fail. Paulson made billions on the trade. He presumably declined to cooperate with Lewis and hardly appears in the book. It's a significant omission and weakens the book. The SEC is now suing Goldman for defrauding its own clients by betting against them that the market would crash.<br /><br />It's sometimes difficult to follow this book. The details are so complex -- reflecting the fact that the financial instruments Wall Street created were made deliberate unintelligible so that no-one could see how dishonest they were. But it's still a great read. We root for the outsiders to succeed.

The details are so complex -- reflecting the fact that the financial instruments Wall Street created were made deliberate unintelligible so that no-one could see how dishonest they were.

B000002U9W|2.0|I'm absolutely amazed that the majority of reviewers here have given this album 5 stars.  ANY other Pink Floyd album, sure.. although I personally don't care much for Ummagumma either... but this one?  Five stars?  Surely you jest!    The most interesting parts of the album, for me, come from the title track.  Although it is too long and lacks focus, the Atom Heart Mother suite is passable and it certainly hints at greater things to come from the band.  The rest of the album is just absolutely boring.  It's plainly obvious to anyone who isn't wearing rose tinted spectacles that the band had come up dry for ideas on this release.  \\"If\\" is merely okay, but it's really still just a snoozer at heart.  \\"Summer '68\\" and \\"Fat Old Sun\\" are not only boring, but they are obnoxious as well.  Those two songs are probably the two worst proper \\"songs\\" in the entire Pink Floyd catalog.  The final track, Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast is mildly fun for a single listen, but it isn't a song, and I have to question the sanity of someone who would actually enjoy listening to the sounds of a man cooking breakfast over directionless, meandering lounge music more than once.      To put my review in perspective, I am a fan of all kinds of music, and the majority of my collection is filled with off kilter, experimental music.  This is coming from someone who actually owns and can enjoy a few Merzbow CDs. It isn't the experimentation that turns me off of Atom Heart Mother.  It's the execution and the absolute lack of enthusiasm for the project.    Buy this one only if you want to give it as a gag gift.  Otherwise, buy any other Pink Floyd album but this one.  Even the band hates this one.

B00171LFFK|5.0|As with many remasters, I didn't know how good it could sound until I heard how good it sounded. The first thing I noticed was how much clearer the famous<br />bass playing was. The bass/guitars/vocal give a you-are-there space and presence, as opposed to the murkier mix of the previous release. I have no idea how Van and the band achieved the mind meld playing on these songs but as everyone knows, the results are poetic, magical, majestic, transcendent and sui generis in this or any past release.<br /><br />Should you buy the import or hold out for a US release? I've waited 20 years for this and I am not holding my breath, but perhaps you can fathom record company logic and scheduling more than I. Next week it could be on the shelves and you could get it for $10. Or it could appear in 5 years. Or never. But if you think this is one of the greatest albums ever and have the coin, this is well worth it.

B000001F2X|5.0|This album is so ouststanding, I can't do it justice...but i'll try. First, it's one of JJ's more ambitious albums, musically, including strings and steel drums (although I should point out that the reggae gem Katy Kool Lady is on the vinyl record, but not this CD, despite its inclusion in the track listing on the bank).They replaced it with and excellent song, \\"Out of Style\\", but when you buy CDs one by one to replace your vinyl records, it's very jarring to have that tune progression you know so well disrupted. Note to one of the other reviewers, Eric Clapton actually did record a song from the is album: \\"I'll Make Love to You Anytime\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat. I can see this book being made into a moive, and that's when you know it's a great find... when it plays lik a movie in your head. It was an easy read and never got boring. I would recommend this books to any teen or adult.
B002K0WBY6|4.0|Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a book publisher, and the scourge of all those who work under her. When she finds out that she's up for deportation back to Canada, though, because her visa has run out, she cons her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), into marrying her so she can stay in the country. As the INS starts looking into their case Margaret must go to Alaska with Andrew to meet his family and to learn more about each other to pass the examination.    Sandra Bullock is America's sweetheart. There is doubtful a person in this country who doesn't like her, and 2009 showed that more than ever as she broke her personal box office twice in the same year after 22 years in the game. She also accomplished that by not playing by anyone's rules but her own. While most people are searching for project after project to keep their name out there, but Bullock hasn't appeared onscreen since 2007's Premonition. So after 2 years out of the spotlight how does her return film fare?    Very well, actually. Don't get me wrong, this romantic comedy doesn't add anything new to the cannon of romantic comedies, and that was probably intentional. While we all might want a movie that's going to stimulate us in a new way, we can't always expect that. This movie does a great job at making it enjoyable enough to keep your mind off that fact that it's not really feeding you anything new. The actors are effortlessly likable, and have great chemistry together. Had the movie had made any other casting choices this movie would have gone down as just another romcom.    It's interesting to me that Bullock chose this role to be her return film. Typically she chooses characters that are immensely likable, but even in this role you still like her even if she is a total ego maniacal control freak. Ryan Reynolds is also a lot of fun to watch, and he's no different here. The real star of this movie though is Betty White as Andrew's grandmother who's turning 90 over the weekend they come to visit. Of course, I don't think anyone doubted the power of Betty White to steal every scene she's in.    I highly recommend this movie, sure it's somewhat cliché, but it's a lot of fun. It's definitely a good movie to just shut off your brain and just enjoy even if you don't typically like romantic comedies.    4/5

B001HN694K|4.0|So I went and saw Alice in Wonderland as envisioned by Tim Burton, acted by Johnny Depp and scored by Danny Elfman. Call me a squealing fangirl, but that combination frequently results in a cinematic win in my view.     First of all, I liked how they linked with the well known animated Alice in Wonderland. I thought it was I nice bit of continuity and was actually rather grateful that it wasn't a remake and instead more of a sequel. This leads to some rather interesting questions regarding the title of the film and indeed, the entire marketing strategy they used.     Actually, for all the hype Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter got in the trailers and advertising, he didn't overpower everything else going on in the narrative. All the characters seemed to be completely in balance without hijacking any part of the story from Alice. It was very nice. It was also an interesting way to present all of the social pressures acting on her.    In a rare case of happy fangirly squeeing, I can't think of any character, including the villains, that I didn't like. The Red Queen sadly saying, \\"It's better to be feared than loved\\" was among the best moments of the film. In addition to that, the White Queen's movements and patterns of speech screamed \\"Disney Princess\\" to me, which might have been overly saccharine and fakey... had it been Alice. The White Queen was a minor enough character that it didn't overpower everything else. I felt that every single character, from the dormouse to the jabberwock were well played and very well voice acted.     The story itself was not as complex as it could have been, but it was still a very cleanly told coming of age tale. I did like the added touch of making Alice older and facing engagement in Victorian England. I especially enjoyed all the parallels that were drawn between Wonderland and the guests at the engagement party. And believe me, there are a lot of them. And it's awesome once you realize where they all are.    The aesthetic didn't distract from the story and instead kept itself as a backdrop and an enhancer. Sometimes the lighting was somewhat overdone, but it seemed to make Alice look pale and colorless that anything else. It did tone down as the film progressed, possibly to show that Alice gained dimension, solidity and maturity as the story kept moving.    I suppose that if I were to levy a complaint, it would be that the comparisons were very obvious and that the story was a bit simplistic at times. It was still well told and definitely geared towards families with young children, but supposed to entertain the adults as well as the kids.     Now I want to go listen to my Looking Glass Wars CD. :P

B0002E5O9G|4.0|I am a Les Miserables fanatic. In addition to this, I own the Les Miserables Dream Cast recording.    It is really interesting to hear different actors play/sing the characters that I like. Philip Quast is my favorite singer ever, and it's really interesting to hear how he played Javert in his earlier career of the character.     I also enjoy listening to how different performers depict the various characters. It is helpful to know which songs are included on the CDs, because this is not a complete set of the musical numbers, but it does have the added bonus of 17 Valjeans.

I'll save you the trouble of reading it - The rework formula holds up every single aspect of starting or running a business against the Keep it Simple Stupid standard. Congratulations you're now as informed as all those who have given an hour or two of their life to this book.    For a group that centers itself on simplicity, they sure did take a whole bunch of words to beat this incredibly simple point to death. In the future, at least provide some contextual evidence to support the argument. Complete crap.

055357342X|5.0|A huge step forward for the series in terms of form, excitement & character.    So much better than book 2, maybe better than book 1, though the idyll of book one is unique.  It took me awhile after book 2 to realize that this book wasn't taking the series further downhill.  Book 2 had been a chore but this book got going quick.  All the characters were wonderful, the ingenious climaxes started halfway through the book and then just kept coming!  Catelyn, Robb, Arya, Tyrion--Jaime may have even been my favorite POV this time.  Sheer incredulous excitement.      I love the perspective of this series, cynical, without sentimentality, but you care about the characters, they're not one dimensional.  In the face of horror they continue to be themselves.  And finally the way he uses POV in this book to show many perspectives on one event justifies the entire reason for having this format!    I can only hope that whenever the new book comes out it's as good as this.  And by \\"this\\" I mean pushing the series to new heights.

0446581348|3.0|Much of this book is on the BB website.  There are several good techniques in here and I enjoyed several parts of the book.  There is some history and some good tips for more professional types.  I am not a professional and found these insights interesting.  However, BB has a motive and wants to sell her techniques and her makeup.  She does not touch upon trends that are conflicting with her own.  She is a great makeup artist, but I would have liked her book to be more well-rounded.
0385528752|4.0|The Heath brothers are really interested in leaving their readers at least a little wiser after reading their book. They are passionate and it shows through their clear writing and well researched book. They direct readers to simple (but not easy) steps to improve and change whatever it is that needs change. The book will give you insight into how to change things whether they are in your work, family, or personal  life. Like their previous brilliant book, \\"Made to Stick\\", they boil down their advice to steps that can be quickly remembered and thus considered. In \\"Switch\\" they advise readers to consider three elements for change. The three factors are the \\"Rider\\" which is the rational side of individuals. Second is the emotional \\"elephant\\" and finally you have to \\"clear the path\\" for the change to succeed.  While each problem may have a bigger component of one of these elements that you have to tweek, all three need to be considered and thought about.    The authors mainly support their strategies through numerous examples. Some of the examples and anecdotes were massaged to prove their point. I found some of the examples boring to read and perhaps that is why I only gave this otherwise excellent book 4 stars. Nevertheless many will find the anecdotes inspiring and will certainly gain ideas for their own personal use.  I highly recommend \\"Switch\\" for anyone who desires to change something.
1416594787|3.0|There is something I noticed about this book that I don't think others have picked up on.  Before getting to that, let me say that it has nothing to so with whether I agreed with his argument about evolution, which I do.  The problem is this:  In his Appendix (which was extremely interesting), Dawkins tells us that studies how that 36% of us believe in evolution \\"but God guided the process\\",  14% believe in evolution but God had no part in the process, and 44% believe that God created human beings within the last 10,000 years.  He also tells us that the book is basically being written to those 44% \\"history-deniers\\".  In his words, \\"this book is necessary\\" to reach those 44%.      While I consider myself agnostic, I know many people of all faiths who I consider to be very religious.  While I don't agree with their views on religion or the historicity of the Bible, I do consider most of them quite smart.  And here's the thing--not one of them falls into that 44% category.  Rather they all fall into the 36% category.   In other words, to their mind, the validity of the theory of evolution (or fact of evolution as he calls it) is not inconsistent with their views on religion and God's role in history.  The two can co-exist.  In fact, I don't know a single person who falls into the 44% category.  While I don't doubt that they exist, I suspect that they must occupy the very lowest intellectual rungs of our society.    I read the whole book pretty carefully and, although I consider myself reasonably intelligent, I honestly couldn't follow the science in at least 80% of the book.  It seemed to me that one would need an advanced degree in biology and perhaps anthropology or chemistry to really comprehend the book.  So, if he's really addressing the book to that particular 44%, I have a very hard time believing that a single one of them would even buy it, much less understand it if they did.  In fact, I would venture to say that there is not a single person in the world whosemind would be changed by this book, and that's not because his argument is not highly persuasive.  It's because the people he is allegedly trying to persuade would never buy or understand the book.    In addition, by purporting to address his arguments to the 44% group rather than the 36% group (which he pretty much ignores entirely), I fee that he picked the wrong target.  It's like saying:  I don't want to go after the smart religious people, so I'll go after the moronic religious people.  Or, let's take his Holocaust-denial analogy a step further:  Say there are two groups out there. One of them denies that the Holocaust ever occurred at all.  The other believes that it occurred exactly as reported but believes that the number of dead killed in the concetration camps has been highly inflated.  While both of these groups may be wrong, which one would be easier to challenge?  Obviously, it's the Holocaust-deniers.  And by analogy, that's the target that Dawkins has chosen.  This is not to say that the 36% group may not be wrong as well.  But the fact is that it would have been much more interesting for him to attempt to debunk the beliefs of that group rather than the group that believes obvious nonsense.
630514415X|3.0|The movie is good, but it could be better. I think Spike Lee, who is a great director and writter, lost himself a little bit in this film. For example I didn't understand the romance between Denzel Washington's and Milla Jovovich's characters. Was all that to show he still loves his wife? Absolutely unnecessary, in my opinion.  Another problem is that Ray Allen was awful, even for an amateur actor.  The meantime, there are beautiful scenes of basketball. The kind of one that makes you want to go outside and throw some shoots.

B002N3GD2Q|3.0|Great show, a very nice compilation of these Felt Forum shows for a serious Doors fan or collector of live music.  However, I was a bit disappointing that all the shows are essentially the same 2 formats repeated over again, with some slight variation and one cool address to the crowd from Jim.  The sound quality is top notch impressive.  Would have even appreciated more noise from the crowd (but im used to old bootlegs).  If this was a two CD set for half the price, would have given 5 stars.  Id rather buy a bunch of different shows than this package, but if you want the complete historic 1970 run at the Felt Forum, then this is definitely for you.
B002VECLVO|5.0|The main subject of this beautifully made and shot movie is grief, one that does not dare to speak its name. From the very beginning the viewer is invited into a world of grief which the main hero cannot share with almost anyone else.<br />George Falconer (absolutely brilliant Colin Firth) learns of his long-term partner's (Matthew Goode good-looking as always) death almost by chance, a distant relative is kind enough to make a phone call, but George is immediately barred from participating in the funeral service. This is \\"for family only\\" and a gay partner does not qualify as such. He does not have the right to mourn the beloved person. The only person with whom he can try to share his grief is his British friend Charlie (stunning Julianne Moore) who is sympathetic but as it turns out does not take Falconer quite as seriously as he would hope for. For her the two men's shared life was \\"a substitute for something else\\", an idea which Falconer rejects outright.<br />The movie present only one day of Falconer's life, the day which he planned as his last, unable to cope with grief he can't share, mourning he was denied, he contemplates suicide. But life has much more up its sleeve and the day proves much different from anything Falconer could have planned.<br />The movie may seem to deal with the past. It is set in 1962 and no effort was spared in the re-making of the US of the days of JFK admistration. But this is not a period piece, the issue it deals with is more than present for many people who live their lifes stuck in closets usually not of their own making. People who are not allowed to reveal their emotions (not necessarily the negative ones) because that would mean revealing much more, something that others refuse to accept.<br />Tom Ford has a perfect eye for the visual side of the movie-making business, Abel Korzeniowski's score is just as perfect, the casting great. Is there anything more to expect from a movie?

It's a heartwarming story, well written.  A book doesn't get better than that! There just aren't enough superlatives to describe my absolute delight and enjoyment!
B002VPE1B6|1.0|The entire movie plays out essentially with the exact same story line as Disney's pocahontas... but with aliens and absolutely brilliant CGI.  The special effects are amazing... the story is bland and predictable.  If you're looking for something pretty to stare at, this is great.  If you're looking for movie with plot, substance or depth, this movie is not it.
1583762027|5.0|I read a book called 'Procrastination: Why You Do It, What To Do About It' That book was worthless and didn't help me at all. I read Tracy's book and was in total control of my life immediately. This is no joke. It really did do everything for me that I had hoped. To be completely honest: I was about half-way through reading 'The Success Principles' when I read this book. So, that book had actually helped me, too. I was on my way back from dropping off my motorcycle at the shop for maintenance. I took the bus downtown, ate at Subway, and was done reading the book by the time I got home about four hours later. It is so amazing. The solutions to overcoming procrastination are so simple it will amaze you. I suggest you get 'The Success Principles' by Jack Canfield as well. It doesn't matter where you are in life. If you haven't read it, you need to.
B0035V35P8|3.0|This movie is a stylish martial arts movie with a whole lot of action.  The plot, well, isn't all that great and interesting, but the action is sort of funny at times.  The opening scene of the movie is kinda funny.  This movie is VERY bloody.  Really over-the-top.  In fact more so than the Kill Bill movies.  Which I thought were pretty bloody.  This one makes that one look tamed.<br /><br />Overall, it was an action flick to see but is forgettable.  I wish the would've spent more time in the monastary showing their training and why they were training.  I really don't understand why they were there in the first place the main teacher played by Ninja veteran Sho Kosugi.  But, the film was shot well.  Except for a couple action shots where the Ninja would sort of \\"dart\\" in from the shadows, then that looked a little fake.  In fact there were a couple of parts where the action looked fake.  It was a little to obvious to take seriously.  After a while you just had to say \\"Okay, it's an action flick.  None of it would be possible\\".<br /><br />This movie could've been a little more involving and not so funny, if some of the stunts and blood were not so unbelieveable.  Like the scene in the restroom where the main character has to take out a man for his watch.  You'll see.<br /><br />Overall, it isn't a bad movie if you like action.  If you are more into drama, then I would recommend you pass on this one.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|The only thing I knew about this movie before watching it was that it was based on true events and it involved police abuse of a mother looking for her missing child.     Single mother comes home from work in 1928 to find her son missing. First the police make her wait 24 hours before they will take her report, then after months they try to make her accept that a boy 3 to 4 inches shorter than her son is her son, who has shrunk from the trauma of the events. She points out several other discrepencies and when she becomes too much trouble they have her locked up in a hospital ward that must have employed half the sadist in LA at the time.     Jolie was good in this role (I am not usually a fan of hers but she did a really good job in this film.) I kept hoping Walter would come home so I was thrown by a loop when they brought up the killings at the ranch (I had never heard of them before.)     If you like your movies filled with twists in the plot line, suspense, and a bit of true crime thrown in this is one for you.

B001N44BW0|4.0|I enjoyed this fast paced movie. Sometimes trying to figure out what was really happening was like trying to keep your eye on the queen in a game of three card monty. Everyone was playing by their own rules, twisting and manipulating people and events to get what they wanted with no consideration of what would happen to the pawns they were using in the espinoage chess game.    Great performances by Crowe and DiCaprio, well worth your time.

Ponyo is such a great character she is sweet, curious and defiant at the same time. If you want to be explore foreign animation this is a great way to start. After you watched Ponyo you are going to want to check out other movies by Ponyo's director Hayaou M. Another great tittle is Kiki's Delivery Service.

For me particulary Eclipse was the best book in the series. I don't want to give away the story but I just want to say that this book takes a turn for the absurd. There are things in this book that contradicts what was said or done in the first 3 books. There will be times where you are going to be thinking was Stephanie M smoking when she wrote this book? I was really dispointed! I wonder how the screenplay for the movie version will be. P.S I think Bella is the worst female character of our time!! The only character I was rooting for throught the whole story was Jacob.

I stuck with it, however, on the strength of the characters--especially the young girl who reminded me of \\"Elaine\\" from Seinfeld.  And I was pleased to find that the plot did not have a conventional ending. Be assured that I'm not insenstitve to people losing their jobs, but, for some reason, the way this film was made didn't quite hit my sympathy button.  In addition the \\"product placement\\" for Chrysler cars was blatant and annoying.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Just want to add to the many complaints, especially those regarding cheap construction.  The item works great, but only on its second use, the handle broke.  No abuse, just shabby construction.  If you examing the handle carefully, you can see very clearly, that the break occurred at a weak point in the handle.  We haven't followed up on the warranty yet, but judging from the reviews, I'm not expecting the outcome to be good.  Will never recommend this product to anyone!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the hunger games is a book that will have you hooked from the moment you pick it up.  The main charcter, Katniss, is a complex and brave character, and whether you like her or not, she will keep you reading.  The Capitol government is powerful and cruel, and holds the hunger games yearly.  Once inside, Katniss must deal with love, friendship, violence, greed, and hate in order to make it out alive.  This story will keep you up reading it, and when you do have to put it down, you won't be able to stop thinking about it.  I would recommend it for mature 12 year olds to high schoolers.  There is violence, but I do not personally find it unnecassary or gorey.  A must read!    I have also read the second book, which although not as good as this one, is still a fantastc read.  (It is called catching fire and is not sold on kindle.)  i cannot wait to read the third, mockingjay.
B000005JA8|3.0|3 1/2      Highly influential anti-traditional release of hellbilly psychedelia is like short-length Kraut rock from some Louisiana back alley. With an overtly offbeat delivery, shrill guitar attacks, and druggy stream-of-consciousness approach the eighty minute endeavor can wear thin all at once, but picked apart there are still a surprising amount of ditties on display that dazzle.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|So is this the best selling movie of all time?  Well it is certainly the most over hyped and overrated movie of all time.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy good science fiction movies, but this is nothing more than typical Hollywood social commentary wrapped up in a long and boring melodrama with unrealistic and drawn out action scenes.      The social commentary becomes paramount to the movie and prevents this from being any more than a simplistic storyline with stereotypical characters who have unimaginative roles.  There are no suprises here.  No unexpected turns or twists.  It almost verges on satire.  The movie is supposed to be futuristic, with complex technology, and sophisticated technological operations on planet Pandora.  You would think it would require humans with specialized training sophistication as well; yet the guy running the robotic bulldozer is portrayed as some redneck in in his flannel shirt and baseball cap.  The evil money grubbing corporate guy is dressed in a present day shirt and tie, practicing his golf skills in the middle of the operations room.  T-shirts, present day military outfits, bows and arrows?  Futuristic?  Give us a break.
B00005UK1F|3.0|Ambitious but ultimately underwhelming prog-metal opus thrives on simply length alone without offering enough showstopping cohesive parts to justify the bloated whole.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|INGLORIOUS BASTERDS    As any one can tell you I am a huge QT fan and basically own everything he has been a part of. So of course when this film was released I had to go see it and the second it was out on DVD/BLU-RAY I had to own it. I knew from the moment this film was announced that it would be another QT classic with out a doubt. Say what you will but it was a major success and you can't discount that at all. I of course knew that I would love this film and of course I did. Call me a Fanboy or what ever but I really did enjoy the film being a QT fan or not.    QT had been writing this film for years and was looking to make this one of his best films ever, I think he did just that. Yes there is another film by this name that QT is a big fan of but this is not the same film. I do however recommend seeing that film because it is another fun one. Any way this film has been in the works long before it was released and I think the time spent on it shows. And for those who have for some reason yet to see this film it is not just about that naughty group of American soldiers who go by the films title. No in fact it tells the story of a group of different people who some how or some way all get brought together some how at some point.    The film follows of course The Basterds lead by Lt. Aldo Raine [Pitt] in their quest to punish and destroy Nazis across the land. Along with Jewish American soldiers like the Bear Jew [Eli Roth] and even German recruits [you will love one guy]. But others like the brilliant Colonel Hans Landa aka the Jew Hunter [played wonderfully by Christoph Waltz] and Shosanna who later becomes Emmanuelle Mimieux [Mélanie Laurent]. Add in a film star named Bridget von Hammersmark [Diane Kruger] and a German war hero Frederick Zoller [Daniel Brühl] and you have a great film.    The film is basically told like a book kinda broke into 5 chapters each continuing the story and bringing them all together at the same time. The first one is set in 1941 while the rest take place in 1944, but rest assured nothing seems out of place at all with the time jump. The chapters are 1.Once Upon a Time in Nazi Occupied France, 2.Inglourious Basterds, 3.German Night in Paris, 4.Operation Kino, and the explosive 5.Revenge of the Giant Face. Every chapter in my opinion is absolutely perfect. The first one is the introduction of the Jew Hunter in one of the best scenes in the film followed by chapter two which is the introduction of The Basterds. The third one is were we catch up with Shosanna who is now Emmanuelle and her admirer war hero Frederick. Chapter four shows us the actress and her plan to infiltrate a planned Nazi gathering for a film premiere. And finally the grand finish which I will not ruin for those who have yet to see it, excellent.    Tarantino has always been known to have great dialogue in his films and this one follows suit, the film is with out a doubt a QT film. The direction is flawless in my humble opinion and how could it be anything less. The cinematography is beautiful and the score is excellent as well, the perfect film is coming together. But it is the performances here that really are great with every one doing a great job. Christoph Waltz is the show stealer as the Jew Hunter and rightfully won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. He is with out a doubt the best thing about this film from the acting stand point and that is really saying something.     Brad Pitt is absolutely hilarious in this film is probably the most fun one in the film with the accent and attitude he showcases in the film. All of the Basterds are excellent in this film as one would expect and that includes filmmaker Eli Roth as the Bear Jew. Mélanie Laurent and Diane Kruger are wonderful in the two female leads for the film as QT has always been able to write strong female characters. Each one is a totally different character with a different life and style but they are more the same then they seem. Martin Wuttke is excellent as Hitlerand who could disagree with that, he is hilarious with his little hair bouncing up and down and flopping every were when he is mad.     Daniel Brühl is also very well cast in the film as a Nazi war hero turned actor who has a thing for Mélanie Laurent's character. These two are great together and deliver one of the best scenes in the film. Also August Diehl is great in the one scene he is in as a German officer who may or may not be on to our heroes. The fact is every one in this film from the smallest part to the biggest are excellent in this film. I would highly recommend this film especially if you like great acting. Also Lawrence Bender returns as the producer for QT, just one more reason to get this. Go but this film now it is worth much more than a rental. The two disc special edition has some wonderful features from behind the scenes to the film within the film [the war heroes' film]. gotta love that Mike Myers cameo.    I waited a long time to see this film and with what was happening in my life around this time I needed an escape.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I have the 143 minute version of this movie on a rickety old VHS tape, plus the original 132 minute theatrical release on DVD with the original motion picture collection. This Director's Cut was what I expected. It's what the late Robert Wise had wanted to do in 1979. It's a good thing he got his chance to complete what couldn't be done back in the 70s. It was logical for me to purchase this directors cut. It is indeed better than the theatrical release.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|Richard Kelly's take on existentialism is more like his Donnie Darko in style than the later Southland Tales. No question this is a peculiar movie but I found it intriguing. I liked the way I was fed clues as to what was ultimately happening. To me this story unfolded in such a way as to keep me guessing but not confound me to the point of feeling lost.    I won't recount the story as others have already done so, but I liked it pretty much start to finish. I noticed that most reviewers here did not care for it at all and I suppose I can see why. When it becomes plain that we're dealing with an alien invasion it comes on somewhat abruptly. I was put off a bit but I stuck with it and I felt things recovered nicely.     This is not a new concept in science fiction. The human race being tested for its worthiness to continue to occupy the universe is old, old, old but it's given a nice spin here. And while some complain about some of the acting, I can't say I disagree, but It didn't bother me that much either. It certainly wasn't horrible and the pacing and tone of the movie precluded the need for balls to the wall performances. What was happening, to me, was more important than the people to whom it was happening. This is not to say I didn't care or feel for them. I just felt they did a good enough job to move the story along.    If there is anything that left me with questions it was the religious angle of the movie. That the events take place around the Christmas holidays is significant and there are pointed references to the afterlife. So since the plot hinges on the \\"you are what you do\\" concept of existence what is Kelly saying? That there is a God and an afterlife but it makes no difference, (or should make no difference) in the choices we make. I don't know but I liked this just the same and might very well add it to my library.
1400052173|5.0|An incredible story.  Well-presented in concise and understandable layman's language.  It is hard to believe that someone's cancer cells can live so long.  It gives one pause as to whether cancer is trying to tell us something such as \\"we can be useful if you find out our secret.\\"  I would highly recommend the book as a wonderful read.    Jeanne
0738711500|5.0|This a great set for beginners.  It has easy to read instructions, and a large piece of paper to help teach you how to layout the cards.  The art work is beautiful.  I would recommend this set to anyone, new or not!
1400052173|5.0|If one were to follow completely separate trails of the history of medicine since the 20th century, scientific advancement, cancer treatment, racism, poverty, changes in rural America, clinical trials, long-term impact of little to no education, patent law, intermarriage, bioethics, child and spousal abuse, the impact of focus and tenacity against great odds, then Henrietta Lacks and this book would be at the intersection of all these separate trails of study.  Any one of these topics would be strong enough to stand alone.  Rebecca Skloot weaves these pieces together through an interesting timeline structure.  Her sentences are powerful.  For example, she describes Bobette as seeming to be a loud woman who was being quiet.  Even though she got to know the family of Henrietta Lacks, the book is fair in the presentation of the complexity of what happens to tissues after they are removed from the body and how the dynamics change when there is the potential for a lot of money.  This is a good read that will make you think.
B0009MAO46|3.0|The movie and accompanying extra features DVDs were unharmed, but the case was smashed at the bottom. The entire bottom strip was in pieces in the envelope. I don't know what happened during shipping, but I was disappointed that I spent so much money for the case to get broken.
B002PLALCE|5.0|Thank God for the life and music of Johnny Cash.  At the end there isn't much more to sing, but the heart of love and the weariness of life that go into the recordings on this album, grace us one final time with Johnny's gift.  It's like a capstone to a unique edifice.
0307271862|1.0|Many Mankell fans were waiting for his newest book and I was one of them. I've read the Mankell's \\"Kurt Wallander\\" series which were outstanding, to say the least. I've read his other fiction and was impressed in equal measure. So I waited in anticipation for this one and was very disappointed.<br /><br />The plot is flawed and the writing is lacking the beautiful prose that make many of his other books such a delight to read. Perhaps the translation contributed even further to this and it might be a slightly better read Swedish, but I doubt it.<br /><br />If it wouldn't be a Mankell book I wouldn't have given it a 1-star - it IS better than some other crime fiction by other authors that is marketed as written by 'one of the best crime writers'. However, once a writer has established himself/herself as a brilliant writer in a particular genre, then to be led to believe that the latest one measures up to previous books, is a very disappointing.<br /><br />I can't help but wondering if perhaps 'The Man from Beijing' is a version of one of the first books Mankell has written (i.e. written before those that gave him the wonderful reputation he deserves) and that possibly his publisher has decided to publish and market it as another international bestseller?<br /><br />Reviewed by Christine Maingard, Author of 'Think Less Be More:Mental Detox for Everyone'
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I stumbled on this show by accident at a relatives house, probably at the 10th to last episode of season 2. So I have the fortune of being able to rediscover this from the beggining. Why is my opinion worthwhile? Because I didn't get into Angel or Firefly and sorta seen a few Buffy episodes.    This show gives me everything I could hope for. A Sophian messianic myth, for starters. It brings up questions about identity, ego, and freewill, and doesn't assume the audience is going to accept the dogma of these concepts as we have been conditioned, but puts them all into question (as I do). An action series with a psycho-philosophical basis.    It might kill a protagonist, and won't insult us by bringing them back from the dead. The constant plot shifts are sublime. I have to put this show up there with the original \\"The Prisoner\\", as one of the best TV series ever done. I like them short and sweet too, like \\"Wonderfalls\\" and \\"Meadowlands\\" that had perfect endings.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|In the late seventies I served as a law clerk for a federal judge in Miami. My judge, with whom I had practiced law before he was appointed, knew as little as I did about what happened to defendants after sentencing. The Bureau of Prisons, who had the final say as to where an inmate would do time, nonetheless published a booklet for judges and probation officers describing each institution in the federal system. Some were pretty tough, and yet others offered (believe it or not) tennis courts as part of the recreation facilities. Defendants convicted on both federal and state charges and sentenced to serve them concurrently invariably preferred federal time to state time. Most of our defendants had committed drug offenses and sought my judge's recommendation as to a facility near their families.    A lawyer I knew had gone to one of the nicest facilities-Eglin, located on the grounds of Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach. It had tennis courts, no fences, and lots of white collar crooks. After his conviction was reversed he resumed the practice of law, but always corrected anyone who talked about time in \\"Club Fed\\". It was a prison, he told them and not a summer camp.    Enter Piper Kerman-Smith College alumnae, drug conspirator, money launderer. Like most defendants, she got to where she was out of sheer stupidity. In this case it was her belief that she could break the law and no one would ever notice. But once one member of her little group goes down, as she found, so do the rest like dominoes. Originally to be sentenced to thirty months, she remained free for years to be available to testify against a West African drug kingpin. Her expected sentence was reduced to thirteen months, which in the federal system which does not have parole but does allow a fifteen percent reduction for good behavior, meaning she would do a little less than a year.     Arriving at Danbury, a much nicer place than the West Virginia home of Martha Stewart, Kerman is quick to grasp the utter powerlessness of her status. She is thrilled to exchange her original prison issued slippers for steel toed boots. Smith College probably never prepared her for a job in the electrical shop, and its dorms were certainly never inhabited by the likes of the women Kerman came to love, fear, or hate. Compared to most of the other prisoners she was unique-a short timer, well educated, and had both family and a fiance who cared. But like every prisoner she was not unique-the decisions one makes in every day life were all made for her, sometimes with mind-numbing bureaucratic inspiration.     During my clerkship, most \\"mules\\" were young women like Piper who did what they did out of a similar motivation. My judge believed that even though these defendants were the lowest members of the drug organizations, they could not go unpunished. Many received the kind of sentence Piper served. Through this memoir I am able to see how truly wise my judge was in requiring enough prison time to make the point, but not so much as to encourage them to resume life in the fast lane.

B000VDDWDS|4.0|If I were reviewing the standard definition DVD, I would have unhesitatingly given it 5 stars.  This is one of my all-time favorite films, based on some of the best books I have ever read.  Unfortunately, the bluray is very grainy and not particularly sharp.  Frankly, it doesn't look much better than the DVD, which I purchased when it came out a few years ago.  Pity, because you couldn't ask for a film that better captures the essence of the Aubrey-Maturin books.  I see there are more than 600 reviews of this film, the overwhelmingly majority of which are very positive, so I don't think I can add anything new.
0385737424|5.0|This is a great light mystery (with a bit of sci-fi thrown in) that I think will appeal to a wide variety of readers, including those who would never think of picking up a sci-fi book or a mystery. For most of the book, the story is just a regular story, with a bit of intrigue. No aliens, no men with dark mustaches, just a story about Miranda and how she has to get on when her best friend stops speaking to her for no reason. The relationships that Miranda, who has only ever really been friends with Sal, ends up forming with her classmates are what keep the book light-hearted in spite of the weird notes she keeps receiving. They are what keep everything normal.      At the same time, these relationships also highlight what is different. At school they are all just kids and they, for the most part, make friends easily. Outside of school, though they are still friends, they are very different. Miranda, whose hair is just brown and who gets stuck with hot pink construction paper for self-portraits, is the daughter of a single mom (as is Sal) who sometimes struggles to make ends meet, but they do alright. Annemarie lives in a building with a doorman and has an elevator that opens right to her apartment; her dad is always making her special snacks and her mom is always as work. Marcus receives free dental care at school because his family cannot afford it otherwise (46). Alice Evans is always really close to peeing her pants (she's not in the \\"group,\\" and this is why). Julia travels the world with her parents and describes herself as \\"café au lait\\" colored with eyes the color of \\"sixty-percent-cacao-chocolate\\" (34). We don't get to learn much about Colin's home situation because, well, he's a boy and doesn't invite Miranda over for a sleepover, nor is it blatantly evident from what happens at school. He's just a goofy guy who gets along with everyone. Other than talking a lot about rushing rivers in front of Alice, the kids don't care about any of this, except that Juliais a snob, having picked up her fancy names for light brown and brown (Miranda's assessment of the situation) while learning about chocolate in Switzerland. Some of the adults, on the other hand, care a lot about this stuff. There is one big confrontation, caused by an adult, which starts out about Julia's race and ends up being about Miranda's lack of money. The way that the group handles it, without any intervention or input from the grown-ups, is possibly unrealistic, but it keeps things from getting too preachy. No one ever has to say, \\"Judging people based on their perceived race or financial status is wrong,\\" and yet the point is made very clearly.    And, of course, there are the letters and the mystery. I don't want to say too much or give anything away. A large part of the fun while reading a mystery is trying to figure out whodunit, and When You Reach Me is no exception. There were definitely points when I thought I had something figured out and I was so frustrated with Miranda because she Just. Didn't. Get. It., but when the end finally rolled around, there was so much more to it than I could have guessed.        Book source: Philly Free Library
B001HN69B8|4.0|No one has a visual sense quite like Terry Gilliam; that's what made Python so unique looking and why I'll watch anything he makes. But as time goes by he is becoming more and more obsessed with the look and less concerned with making movies that always entertain and never lag, and neglects getting great readings from his actors. His last, Brothers Grimm, was the perfect example, and IODP is at least better than that one.<br /><br />Ledger is also much finer in this than he was in BG, but still not wonderful, all told. He's not really that interesting an actor here, expecially when playing against a true master like Plummer, who steals the show easily. Even Ledger's stand-ins after his death are more fascinating to watch, Farrell above all. He's got what I'd call real star-quality; it's hard to stop watching him even when he's not speaking. Whereas Heath here is just kind of there, and never makes me feel that happy sense one gets of watching a master at work, unlike his turn as the Joker.<br /><br />Likewise Gilliam at the helm. He is a master, no question. Holy Grail, Time Bandits, Brazil and Twelve Monkeys are all classic films, but sadly his last two decades have been rather fallow in terms of masterpieces. On the other hand, he did make the messy Munchhausen early on, and most of his latest films have its mix of splendid visual and murky storyline. Gilliam does make extremely attractive films, in any case, and it's hard to beat him for pure eye candy. The colors and sets here are lush and crisp, and his mix of the stale, modern look of London up against the fun fantasy sheen of the circusy Parnassus troop works well.<br /><br />Yet the script just doesn't measure up, and it all takes a little too long. The fantasy sequences are wonderful, and most of the acting is solid, but in the end I didn't have that satisfied glow one gets after watching a truly great movie. I did however get a few smiles, had my imagination tweaked, and enjoyed plenty of wow visual moments, so it's pretty much what one expects from Gilliam these days.<br /><br />And let's not sell Terry short. He has very much his own style and sense of filmmaking, and it's a pleasure to watch his work even when it gets a little too Byzantine for its own good. If you've ever liked his work, you'll also enjoy this, and as fantasy films go, it's worth your time, with Plummer adding the extra edge that he's gifted so many films with.hat one expects from Gilliam these days.

0385732554|5.0|I really liked reading The Giver by Louis Lowry. I think that students ten years old and up would enjoy this book also. This book revolves around a boy named Jonas and the perfect world that he lives in. In this Utopia, everyone is the same. The people who live here cannot see color or feel emotions. After the age of twelve, nothing changes and you are assigned a job for the rest of your life.   This book tells the story of the position of Giver which Jonas is being trained for.  Even though I liked reading this book, I cannot imagine living in a perfect world. I like the fact that there are people with different thoughts and feelings.  I like meeting people and hearing what they have to say. In a Utopia nothing ever changes. Even when something bad happens in our world, you can learn from it. With Jonas, the people never learn or grow, they are assigned a life. The author was able to create a world that was interesting to read about and maybe someday in the future there might be some form of living that way, it does make you think.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|i know this is a pre-review, but, barring some glaring technical glitch, this will be a truly great set.  LOST is a show unlike any other in the history of the medium.  not only is it a great show, with inspired acting, inspiring music, gorgeous photography, and trippy storylines...  not only does it have deep characterizations and an even deeper mythology...  not only is it cinematic in scope yet intimate in the smallest character moments...  not only is it, like, totally addicting.  it's also the first time (at least here in the u.s.) that a t.v. series has a complete beginning, middle and end, just as the creators intended it.    so many shows start out brilliantly, chug along for a while on that inspiration, then start to peter out somewhere along the way and then... stop (twin peaks).  or, are episodic in nature and don't have the burden of having to *end* properly.  but LOST started off with a bang, settled in with the characters and their predicament, started to repeat itself *just* a bit, then decided that it needed to end at a certain point and started it's long steady march toward it's denouement.  and it's been nothing but greatness ever since.    it's often said that movies are like short stories, and t.v. is more like a novel.    well, we have our first truly great novel.

But in the community you have absolutely  no freedom because  when its your birthday on certain years they have ceremony's which they give you new things but you lose your previous things. The other is that when you turn 12 you officially become a adult and your assigned a job, a spouse, and you can sign up for a baby. Then when Jonas gets the most important job in the community he starts to get memories from the last recover and he learns watch the community used to be. I think that the book was a decent one It wasn't one of my favorite books because it seemed boring to me because all it did was describe the community the only part in the book I got that wasn't boring was the end because so many things happened. Also I think that Lois lowery could had make the book make more sense because I think that their would never be a community that is so perfect. But I thought Lois did a very good job with the explaining of the story and the description. I would recommend this book to readers 9 and older because you need to be a little older to understand this book. I would rate this book a 3 stars because it had great descriptions but it was pretty boring.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The movie is not set where the real Hachiko lived, but that doesn't matter.   Faithfulness, loyalty, and friendship are the same in any country, any era, among any people or animals.  That is the point of this story, which focuses on an Akita dog whose bond with his master is so strong that it goes on even after death.    There is nothing traumatic, though, so it is fine for older kids/preteens to watch.  Adults will be inspired as well, and--thank goodness--it makes a point without being mushy or melodramatic.    Nice film.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|Albert and Victoria are depicted here in their younger days, meeting, falling in love, marrying, and dealing with the problems that go along with governing an empire.  This is a nice story that will not offend anyone with excessive violence, and the sexual content is very mild and not at all graphic.  The actors all do a superb job, the costume and set design are stunning, and the music is just right.  You will love the English gardens as well.    Good for fans of historical drama.
B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|I just finished watching this weekend and I am amazed on how better it is in hidef.  All the CG that they added/redo, it is all worth it.  It is like watching it again for the first time.  A must for all Evangelion fans out there.  I've been a follower since the late 90's and still am.  The only reason why I didn't give a full five star is they did not include the original intro and end credits songs from the TV series as part of the special features.  I hope that they include it in the 2.0 or later.  Other than that, I love it!
B001FB4VZS|4.0|The legion from the future arrives, the Watchtower is formed, Lex and Lana finally fade out of the scene, and Clark and Lois develop their relationship further.      What's disappointing is the change in Chloe, who used to be so smart. She is now unpredictable and not too smart in some of her choices, especially as regards Davis/Doomsday.  Also, it's unfortunate what happens to her and Jimmy Olsen.      However, it is worth sticking with the saga to see how Clark expands and stumbles on his way to becoming Superman.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Fantasy is one thing but when an event of major historical significance is trivialized to fiction, I think it's a disgrace. A 60th anniversary commemorative edition? This movie is an insult to those who were actually there and the entire generation who lived through or died in WWII.    It is nothing more than the producers' attempt to benefit from the anniversary of others' misfortune.    Sure Ben Affleck is in the Eagle Squadron in England and is shot down over the English Channel and NOBODY knows he survived until he miraculously turns up in Pearl Harbor. Did he swim all the way?    Then he and Josh Hartnett are the ONLY ones to get their planes in the air during the Japanese attack. Then we see them trying to save sailors trapped in the Arizona because, apparently, nobody else could do it.    Then Affleck and Hartnett become pilots for the Doolittle Raid, in spite of the differences between flying a fighter and a bomber, not to mention flying bombers off an aircraft carrier deck.     And when Hartnett dies in the Doolittle Raid, they drag his rotting carcass all the way across China with Japanese soldiers on their ass so there can be a hero's return in a coffin at Pearl Harbor? Puh-lease!    Interwoven is a lame love story that has a syrupy ending.    Hollywood has taken fictionalized characters and made them larger than the event on which the movie is based. Therefore, this movie flat-out sucks.
0517530716|5.0|When I was a teenager I purchased my 1st edition of \\"The Annotated Dracula\\" and when I found out that there was a annotated edition of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel  Frankenstein, I knew I just had to get it.<br /><br />Let me state that it is such a great piece of literature that it is worth pretty much whatever the supplier charges.<br /><br />First off, for those who are much more familiar with the classic 1931 film of the same starring Boris Karloff, that the creature is much less deserving of sympathy in the novel than in the 1931 movie.<br /><br />In the 1931 classic movie the monester is not at all intelligent,the creature can only make noises and makes a motion with his hands with a sad look on his face, that seems to suggest \\"Please,please help me\\"<br /><br />Not so in the novel however, in fact the monster is a true genius, having taught himself such languages as French.<br /><br />When the creature kills he knows perfctly well what he is doing and why. Indeed in the 1818 novel the creature essentialy \\"frames\\" a young woman named Justine for the murder of one of Victor's realtives.<br /><br />The monster on more than one ocassion threatens/blackmails Victor into doing things which Victor does not want to do.<br /><br />There are also very intresting nuggets of information, such Mary Shelley's relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley, the realtionshp of the novel Frankenstein with such poetry as \\"The Rime of the Anicent Marriner\\" and \\"Paradise Lost\\"<br /><br />Wolf also explores some darker themes that were excised by Mary Shelley from the more widely known 2nd edition published in 1831, notably incest and that the Frankenstein family appears to be dysfunctional.<br /><br />This is a great novel, and better than the 1831 2nd edition or any of the movies that have been done.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Noah never had it so good.  All he had was a lot of rain. Now thanks to CGI we have earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tsunami's and other explosions and fireballs that makes the end of the world seem like fun.  Ouch! John Cusack with two small children, an ex-wife and her new husband in tow helps start a brave new world. With Cusack and his ex still having feelings for each other you just know the new husband will die.  He does.  Woody Harrelson has a brief role as a tree-hugging conspiracy nut-case who believes when the world ends we will all fly off in spaceships.    The main and top-most problem with the movie is it's ridiculousness. Since Cusack is the star he has the super-human ability to survive road chasms, they open up just as he passes, skyscrapers tumble and the debris misses his car as he drives by, bridges collapse and in mid-collapse he sails under in his stretch limousine. He is a limo driver who earns his bread and butter driving rich folks around while he forgets he was once a novelist whose first book sold 422 copies.    After we're treated to seeing famous landmarks destroyed including the vatican with the Pope in mid-prayer and a Tibetian temple with a monk in mid-prayer, everyone who's anyone, with a few thousand nobodies and animals all end up on an ark. And to make some kind of point that escapes me, the everyone who's anyone are politicians. Egads! I think I'll pass on that trip.    The movie at 2 hours 38 minutes is a bit long for an old-fashioned Saturday afternonn time-waster but the special effects are good.    Whether it was intentional or not the movie offers up a tribute to the old Sanford and Son TV series that starred Redd Foxx.  Whenever Fred Sanford wanted his own way he would clutch his chest and talking to his dead wife would say \\"I'm coming Elizabeth, I'm coming\\"  Danny Glover plays the president whose wife has passed and when he looks out the White House window and sees a tidal wave coming, he looks up to heaven and says, \\"I'm coming Elizabeth, I'm coming home\\".
B00008PX8P|5.0|Nothing more need be said than that this shows you everything you need to know about the greatest band of the 70s. Riff upon riff. Bonzo never missed. Jimmy is beyond words. JP Jones is a behemoth and Robert Plant, or Percy as the band called him, had a voice from beyond. I especially enjoyed the acoustic performances, but everything here is essential. I only wish there was more.
0451203933|5.0|When I read \\"Lone Survivor\\" it gave me the itch to read more non fiction war stories.  I more specifically wanted to read more modern war stories that have happened in my lifetime.  I really enjoyed the movie \\"Blackhawk Down\\" and remember speaking to an ex Air Guard pilot tell me a little bit about his memories of being active Air Guard at the time it happened.  The author has obviously put tons of man hours into research and recounts many first hand accounts of the Rangers and Delta soldiers involved.  You'd think that it was being written by a soldier that was there first hand.  Very interesting that the US public really had no idea that this went on until much later...Pretty crazy considering that so many casualties were suffered.
B001PO53IO|5.0|Great value nice mini artwork book included. Menus are ok, a little sluggish for the minor animations.
1400063736|3.0|The book starts strong but falters after a few chapters. I love McCann's turn-of-phrase, there are some real word jewels here. Every now & again there's a sentence that would have me setting the book down to ponder the original thought. But there were too many characters, none of whom was really the focus. It's supposed to be understood that the focus is the tightrope walker, but his presence is felt rather than experienced. That being said, I found the book to be lacking in depth, what with each chapter taking a turn with a new face. It's an interesting device that would've worked better if the characters could've been fleshed out more. What with tackling so many, there's a redundancy, in terms of these people questioning themselves, their lives, their regrets. That constant questioning after awhile became tedious.<br /><br />I finished the book feeling as though I never had the pleasure of identifying or connecting with any character. Lots of surface skimming here. Still, I do so like his way with words and will seek out more by him. I recommend this with caveats. A good beach/airport read.

B0011UF79C|5.0|After watching the movie again for perhaps the fifth or sixth time recently, I felt compelled to write a review for it here on Amazon.  The movie has remained as one of my absolute favorites ever since it came out.  It is one of the few movies I can watch repeatedly and that I own in my personal collection.  After just watching it, after 13 years since its release, it still feels as fresh and relevant as it did when it came out.<br /><br />I won't summarize the plot to you here since there are plenty of reviews and websites that can do it for you better than I can.  Rather I'll say it is among an exclusive club of intelligent sci-fi movies that make you think and don't get bogged down in their 'future-ness'.  There isn't any special lingo to learn or technology to understand to appreciate and enjoy this movie.  That makes it readily approachable by even those who are typically put off by the genre and an even more special treat to those who like sci-fi.<br /><br />In short I highly recommend a viewing of this movie if you haven't seen it yet.  It is a true gem that holds up against the test of time.

0486268659|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories -- not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.<br /><br />Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.<br /><br />And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.<br /><br />So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.<br /><br />You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.<br /><br />Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.<br /><br />He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.<br /><br />Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all.

0316776963|5.0|This was my first David Sedaris book, and after reading it, I cannot wait to get my hands on all his others. The short stories that fill this book are hilarious. David Sedaris has a quarky sense of humor that I find refreshing. I found myself laughing out load again and again. I could really identify with some of the thoughts he expresses in the text and that is rare, and a little scary.<br /><br />I could have flown through this book, but my preference was to savor it for all it's worth. I highly recommend this book, and I will be sure to review his others, as I read them.
1416575464|5.0|This is a book I enjoy looking at over and over and it has many stimulating ideas.  It is a nice addition to the design books I have.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|I don't get how the initial review of this movie refers to it as a homophobic revenge.  What is homophobic about being raped as a child?  They didn't revenge on these guards because they were homophobic.  It had nothing to do with the story.  These people were getting revenge on people that took their innocence away as the movie clearly portrays.  This homophobic garbarge needs to stop.      Sorry that just pissed me off.      Whether or not the story is true or false is left up for questioning.      The movie was superbly acted and should be watched whether or not the story is true and shouldn't effect the reasoning to see or not to see the movie because if it didn't happen there is no reason to think it couldn't have in some form.
B00004ZBVG|3.0|Good action flick, but don't expect a true story. When they say 'Based on a true story' they mean very loosely based. I enjoyed the movie, but am always disappointed when they absolutely ignore what really happened. For the real story get the book 'Rescue of BAT 21' - very good.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|The first thing you'll notice is that SGU is trying to capitalize on the success of BSG: the camera work is similar, the atmosphere equally grim, and the recipe laced with a dash of sex. Luckily they also copied BSG's inclusion of philosophical debates (whether spoken or inferred) and the grand social experiments that spring out of one of sci-fi's oldest scenarios: people being stuck in space with each other. You'll also notice that they are playing around with flashbacks; many shows do this, but i got a distinct impression early on that they were trying to mimic LOST. Sometimes it works, other times it's just distracting.<br />Although \\"military sci-fi\\" is my least favorite subgenre of space shows, i have loyally watched every episode of Stargate since 1997. SGU breathes new life into the franchise - Atlantis was starting to get repetitive and i was basically only tuning in to experience the witty, whiny sarcasm of David Hewlett. SGU not only displays some talent in acting, but also a few new ideas in plot that were not explored in Stargate shows previously.<br />SGU was struggling to find its footing in the first half of the season, and it suffered from some particularly boring plots, such as one horrible episode that was the equivalent of having a wasp stuck in your house and trying to chase it out a window. Yet my perseverance in watching has finally paid off in the 2nd half of the season. The story arc is finally developing nicely, including a new group of aliens who lack the cheese factor of SG-1's Goa'uld and so far have proven more mysterious than the Wraith.<br />One thing that annoys the hell out of me is random inclusion of songs in the eps that i guess are supposed to be part of the narration or something but bomb the mood instead of affirming it. I mean the emo or whatever type of crap music they use is not as much of a disaster as if they woulda spliced a rap song into the footage, but they really screwed up bigtime by including music with lyrics. Obviously someone on the production team wanted to be trendy and/or include their favorite artists: this indulgence should not have been permitted.<br />Anyway, the plot possibilities are almost limitless, and I think SGU has potential to pull off some great story arcs and keep the generally smart tone of the show without the trappings of its predecessors. Let's hope they keep moving in the direction that the 2nd half of s01 turned towards.

0439023483|5.0|After many students suggested that I read this book, I finally gave in and picked it up.  I must admit up front that I had a very hard time reading this book.  I am a teacher, and the ideas behind this book was hard for me to swallow.  However, this was a very good book once you just allowed it to set in.    Basically, the world has changed.  Katniss lives in the poorest district of Panem.  She learns to hunt beyond the fence (an illegal activity) in order to provide for her mother and sister after the death of her father.  However, the day that we begin brings us to reaping day.  On this day, two contestants from each district, one boy and one girl, are chosen to go to the capital to fight to the death in The Hunger Games.  Each child from the ages of 12-18 have their name in a lottery.  At 12, the child has one entry and then it goes up as the age goes up.  Katniss is worried about herself, but she doesn't think her sister would have a chance of being called, until of course, that happens.  The moment her sisters name is called, Katniss decides to take her sister's place.  Katniss volunteers to go to the slaughter so that her sister can stay behind.  Her fellow competitor from her district ends up being Peeta, a baker's boy.  The two are taken to the capital together.  They are styled and shown off for the entertainment of the rich all the while getting ready to be killed in the arena.  Once in the arena, the children are supposed to kill one another until the last child is standing.  Who will survive?    It's hard not to get caught up into this adventure and survival story.  Katniss is an intricate character that grows on you almost immediately.  I loved the interactions between her and Peeta.  It was an interesting relationship to watch grow.  The action keeps you drawn in and this book is extremely difficult to put down.  As I mentioned before, I had a hard time with the premise.  My life is dedicated to protecting and encouraging children.  I find it hard to imagine children killing one another, or even being put into that situation.  That premise might have been one of the reasons why I put off reading this book for so long.  It is a brutal tale and some of the scenes are difficult to swallow.  It is not for the faint of heart or for younger readers.  As a teacher, I would judge the students maturity level before I turned this book over to them, and if I was a parent, I would read it first.    5/5 stars and I can't wait until I get a chance to read the second and third books.

B00004X10B|5.0|I have had this bag, the Tamrac 5612 Pro 12 since March 2010. The storage capacity and ease of use makes this bag a must have.  I carry two camera bodies, 4 lenses, 3 flashes, memory cards, required cables, and all the user manuals and they all fit and are easy to put in and take out.  For everyday use this bag rocks.  The big test was going on vacation.  I just spent a week in Puerto Rico and this bag more than paid for itself.  Fully packed this bag weighs more than 20 lbs but the balance and comfort of this bag makes it easy to carry around.  But the main thing for me was all my equipment made the trip and back in perfect shape.  I was in and out of this bag many times a day and never had any problem finding or replacing my equipment.  I actually wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|Well well well, haven't we seen all this before? Doesn't it all seem a bit familiar? This movie is a complete rip-off of the revisionist clap-trap that won 7 Oscars back in 1990. Yes. You guessed it. Dances with Wolves. If you compare this movie almost scene by scene, you will discover that Jimmy C did a complete rip off job when it comes to the story. This is nothing more than a very expensive New Age Mother Earth sermon, a manipulation of the senses to steer the unsuspecting toward a future political/spiritual belief where the masses will not mind in the least when Third World populations are purposefully depleted through sterilisation, among other things, to help poor wee mother-earth survive us big bad mean humans boohoo! The tree-huggers in this movie are all so good and the humans are all so bad, except for the ones that become the tree-huggers along the way. There is so much to say about the demonic side to this movie, but alas it is so blatant, it should remain needless to point out. This will do for the beautification of Satan, what George Lucas's Star Wars did for making God into an impersonal force in the mind of Man, a force that no one will ulimately be accountable to. Hell is full today with people screaming, \\"But I thought the Force was going to be with us!\\" Yet another fantasy of lies and deception created by yet another Cosmic Humanist denying the truth about Heaven and Hell by whittling it all down to people \\"borrowing energy\\" and having \\"to give it back\\" to the One source mumbo-jumbo. So bottom line. 1 Star for the animation, pretty, blue, shinny, aawwh! But all in all, a complete rip-off of DWW, and the same old lie whispered into Eve's ear back in the Garden: \\"You too can be as God...\\" But given the feed back I've heard, pretty effective occultic propaganda thrown at a world without the eyes to see or the ears to hear.  The road to Hell is, in deed, a gradual one, paved with good intentions, with no sudden dips or fanfare...
B003JYOEYM|4.0|I am a big fan of horror films, and I have written film reviews at several websites regarding films of all types.Lately, most films of the horror genre have been quite boring and uncreative. The 'zombie films' have been remade, and a ton of junk have been made which touches upon the zombie idea. Only a handful have any merit.<br /><br />Romero's \\"Survival Of The dead\\"is an interesting study in human behavior in a time of crisis. It goes beyond what all the 'rip-off' walking dead films portrayed, and speaks quite realistically of what may become of humankind in the wake of such an epidemic.<br /><br />I won't go into details of the film's content. I would only invite you to view it and interpret what you will. Romero's approach to this series has always been one of exploring underlying social commentaries on certain issues,one of which would be the purported notion of 'human morality'.No other director of these 'zombie flicks' have touched upon this as well as Romero.This film is a fine compliment to the other films of Romero's series.<br /><br />I would not go into it trying to compare it with his earlier classics, but rather to look beyond to the vision that this director has for the genre he started.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|The Good:  This book is all good.  Lynch as a flow about his writing that allows readers to flip through quickly and enjoy every bit.  He is descritptive without being overbearing and the characters are enjoyable and have their own personalities.  The ending is biting, brutal without being overly grotesque, and overall satsifying.      The Bad:  Throughout the book Lynch has included \\"intermissions\\" where the main story veers off and he examines a back story or historical footnote.  This wasn't too bad but I found I was skipping past some pages because I was so enthralled by what was actually happening and cared less about the footnotes.    The Ugly:  F-bombs.  There are a lot of f-bombs in this book.  Personally I did not care but for someone who isn't ready for it, it can be a bit of a surprise.  I actually think they added the necessary grit but others may not think so.    The Verdict:  If you don't mind the cursing, then read this book. You will not be let down.

B00008G7UJ|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of Romeo and Juliet, as there are many better romantic plays by Shakespeare, who I am a huge fan of, though I think in expressing the intent of the play, this movie keeps the tone perfectly.  After this movie came out on VHS, which I bought, I started to collect the many forms of the many plays of shakespeare's work, to include all the reworkings that came about after the success fo this film.  Of all of them, this is the only one that actually keeps the plays dialouge, What it manages to do is keep up a constant pace that doesn't slow down from the heavy diologue, because as much as I love the plays, and have seen many of them live, the first order of a film is to show, and how it manages to do that is to constantly have visual reminders of what the characters are talking about.  All the actors are strong, and though for a long time surrounding Titanic I hated Leo, I have to say that he is a very talanted actor and this shows it.  Yes the two main characters are not good for anyone around them, there is a very serious tone that these two keep messing things up, but the supporting cast does a great job of picking up the slack to show the ramifications.  This movie doesn't appear as though it cost a lot of money, but definately has a lot of style, one of the best soundtracks of all time, my favorite song being a cover with full gospel choir of Prince's When Dove's Fly.  I do like zefferelli as an artist, but this movie even trumps his interpretation of the play, this is the version of the popular play and plays seemlessly to young adults and adults with visual subtexts and sillyness.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|The first season was a little slow (at least by comparison) but season 2 is awesome! There has been much more action and the plots have gotten better with the addition of the reformed Mord Sith Cara to the merry little band and even briefly having Darken Rahl (villain from season 1) join them. If you liked Lord of the Rings or that sort of thing, this is a must buy for you. It has wizards, witches, magical swords, women that can make you tell the truth, prophecies, dark lords, epic struggles between good and evil and even a few of the actors from Lord of the Rings. All it's missing is a ring and some elves, but I guess they had to leave something for season 3...if there will be a season 3 that is. As the previous reviewer said, it is doubtful the show will be picked up for a 3rd season. It has suffered from a serious lack of publicity almost from day 1. Were it not for Briget Regan going on G4 to promote the show I wouldn't have known it existed and if not for Tivo I would have never known when it was on. I watch it on WGN (which has said they will not air season 3) and the only promos for the show I ever see come on right after watching the episode. So the only people that will ever know when it is on are those that already knew when it was on....how do you grow an audience like that? It's kinda like a guy cutting off his horse's leg and then complaining that it doesn't ride fast enough so he shoots it. Hopefully syfy will pick it up. If you are a fan of the show or haven't seen it yet but want to, please Email to feedback@syfy or disney/abc and ask them to give us a 3rd season so they can at least give the show a proper ending. There are numerous sites that have a link to sign the petition for season 3 Sign it or risk being burned with Wizard's Fire!<br /><br />Update: Season 2 just ended with a bang! You do not want to miss it. If you were one of the many that were not fortunate enough to watch this show at a regular time slot and have any interest at all in the show, you MUST buy this dvd and you will not be disappointed. Things ended in a way that if that is really the end it is an ending worthy of rememberance but there are still questions and certainly a hint that the true dark lord of the series could come back with a vengeance. I for one want to see what happens next. Keep fighting Seeker fans! Maybe we can get a partial season or tv movies or something.

B000001EC1|5.0|I'm by no means the biggest bon jovi fan in the world, and the only other album I have purchased was Slippery When Wet, on cassette, in the bargain bin, because I had an old used car that didn't have a cd player, so I was always on the hunt for cheap albums.  I did enjoy it, but there was plenty of filler, as I have felt there has always been on their albums.  That being said, who doesn't sing along to living on a prayer, You Give Love a bad Name, or Wanted Dead or Alive.  All the clasic 80s and 90s tracks are here, as this came out in 94, but it doesn't have any of their recent material, which isn't always a bad thing, as their newer stuff isn't nearly as strong as the old stuff, which I'm sure for the die hards, they will complain, but then again, if you are a die hard, you probably already own them, though its my life is one that I personally miss.  Even as a greatest hits album there are still some songs that I wouldn't be sad to get rid of, so I wouldn't mind a more definative greatest hits album, but respect the band for not making a new one ever year or two like Aerosmith, and I can't stand the Left makes a right as a reimagining of their hits, mostly acoustic and piano pieces that are hit and miss.  This came out before the band broke up the first time so that jon could pursue acting, and this was supposed to be definative, but with a recent release I don't see a new greatest hits album coming any time soon.  For a look at the old Bon Jovi and all the songs that the average person knows by heart, this is still the one album you should get in the Bon Jovi Catalouge as I have always thought of Bon Jovi as a greatest hits kind of band and this is it.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|In answer to the sceptic who thinks we all work for Mr Landau, I was there and have seen the opening track on Youtube as filmed by [...], so would like to think that rest of the concert is filmed in the same way! The concert was fantastic, but the final set by Bruce and the E Street band was the closest someone as young as myself is probably ever going to get to seeing these guys in their prime. Glastonbury was a warm up for this show remember, and for those who caught that on the BBC, or live, believe this was one step up! They gave it their all, and when a group like this with a frontman like The Boss give it their all, you simply can't ask for anything more. By the way I don't work for Bruce or Mr Landau in any form, other than to shout loud and proud about anything Bruce and the E Street-er's release that warrants such devotion. Having said that, bar what should have been a double album from him in the mid 90's, (Human Touch and Lucky Town), which had some great tracks, but lacked that certain something, I've shouted for everything i was alive to see released, from Tunnel of love, through Tom Joad, the seeger sessions and Magic! Come on, the greatest rock front man, with the greatest comrades backing him up! This is not to be missed. And if you have any jobs going Mr Landau get in touch!    Sam Butler
B000ELJBAA|5.0|I don't know what album these reviewers have been listening to, but the track \\"NEAR THE END\\" is very Haunting and Classic Gilmour!   Out of the blue, let's get metaphysical and Near the end, are worth the price.   If you are a Gilmour fan and don't know these tunes, you are seriously doing yourself damage. I remember when this came out on Vinyl and I snagged a copy, I was so impressed with Drummer Porcaro's playing and Gilmour just showcased it, not to mention set the controls for the heart of the Sun on his stratocaster.   Unfortunately, Jeff Porcaro died, but these tracks are incredible!

It's too bad this series appears headed for the history books since WGN has announced they will not air season 3. If you liked this show you should fight for it HARD right now.

B000077VR3|4.0|I remember going to see this one in theaters with my grandmother because she kept hearing about it on tv from Rosie O'donnel, and I did enjoy it.  Visually the film is very stimulating, and the songs and story are fun, often paradying concepts and pop songs, while always managing to be uplifting and entertaining.  This movie has the most momentum of almost any film that I have ever seen, and I have to say that the editing did give me a head ache before the end of the film, but was still entertained enough to finish the film.  I remember when they said that this would signal the new wave of musicals that had been dead before this came out, and I have to say that thankfully they went a more traditional route as once was enough.  I know a lot of people that absolutely love this film, and I have to say that it was fun, but I can't imagine any more helpings of this droning on any longer.  The movie has said everything that can be said in its tone and style, which is very evident in the director's latest offering, Australia.  Its definately an original that there is nothing else out there like it, and everyone should at least try this movie, but it may not be for everyone.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I couldn't even begin to praise the writer/director for this film enough.  This movie is beautifully directed.  The actors are phenomenal, and several scenes and the scenery can take your breath away.  The montages should have editing awards and the sound track is so wonderful if you are any thing like me you will start looking for Shane Mack's CDs.<br /><br />  Love is a powerful emotion and in this movie, Jonah Markowitz (writer/director) takes you to all the corners of it.  From the young man who has loved his family so unconditionally that his wants and needs are never thought about.  To the friends he has loved, cherished and respected.  And especially to the man he comes to love who teaches him what it's like to be on the receiving end and valued for the person he is first.<br /><br />  I'm a 47 year old woman who has been reading romance books for almost 30 of those years.  It's rare for any movie to capture so many sides love.  I see praises for this movie as the best gay romance.  That is almost an insult to this movie, to limit it as such.  This is one of the best romance (happy ending) movies I have seen in a very, very long time.  If you're looking for a romance that will bring many emotions to the surface look no more.<br />BUY WITH COMPLETE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU WILL WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER, I HAVE!!!<br /><br />  Oh and thanks Jonah for the book!  To those who don't know this movie has been put in book form.  Comes out in June (2010) and I've already pre-order several copies  and can not wait to read it.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|This movie is a genuine \\"feel good\\" movie.  It is entertaining for the whole family and promotes good interpersonal relationships. It is a wholesome relief from all the sex and violence we have come to expect in entertainment today. Thank you Pixar and Disney.
0812973992|4.0|A very readable book that examines hope and faith from a variety of perspectives. Set in New York in the 70s it centers around a specific day when Philip Petit walked between the World Trade Centre towers, and how that day unfolded for the individuals that are central to the story. A pair of Irish brothers in New York looking for their futures, streetwalking whores and Park Avenue's elite all contribute their perspectives on the fortunes that life has given them.<br />A well written book, it slows down a bit but finishes with a surprizing twist. Very thought provoking.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|All I have to say is when I turned on the discovery channel to find Oprah doing the narration for Life, I tried to watch it then shut it off and cancelled the dvr scheduling. Please people order the BBC version with David Attenborough, he is quite possibly the greatest narrator to ever live. He also has a deep understand of what he is narrating.
B000YI7MRM|4.0|This is a very well-acted film, but most importantly, achieves something rare....creating a sense of the time and place (16th century Spain).  It's beautifully filmed...some of the scenes are strikingly like paintings.  I've read the books and my only criticism is that the plot is too complicated and tries to cover too much ground - the storylines from basically the whole series of books are crammed into one movie.  Still a very engrossing story, but I would have preferred a focus on one or two books, which would also have left room for a sequel.
0894803123|5.0|I bought this recipe book as a companion for my daughter's Christmas gift of a ice cream maker. We have made anything from plain chocolate to mocha almond to lemon sorbet. Everything has turned out great...our favorite being the vanilla with cookie dough that we made last night. My daughter is only 11 years old and she has been able to follow the directions and make the recipes on her own.
B00371QQ2U|1.0|At first, my Sherwood 5004 blu-ray player hooked to the BD-Live function played this blu-ray, but only intermittently.  Today, when I found that my Panasonic BD-35 had a new firmware update, I tried the blu-ray on it and it worked.<br /><br />What did I find after a very anxious and lengthy wait?  It seems that Universal wants me to see little blurbs of their upcoming movie attractions on the top right of the screen across from the top menu choices (play, chapters, special features, set up, et al.)  So I am forced (not given a choice as to whether I connect to BD-Live) to download the BD Live stuff as the disc boots up.  They indicate this on a short flash screen during the interminable upload but reward me by telling me that the content is constantly updated.<br /><br /> Whoopee!<br /><br />I do not like a studio forcing me to wait for load of drivel that I don't care to watch (also think of the Fox, Disney and Lions Gate interminable trailers) that I will not watch/do everything to avoid watching and would prefer the blu-ray to start with the movie as Warner Bros is decent enough to do.<br /><br />Whatever idiot at Universal originated this concept should be bounced out the door ASAP. (Of course, having worked in management I can just visualize the execs. sitting around the table as some young, eager man or woman comes up with this marketing ploy to push other product - he or she probably got a big bonus, can you imagine that?)  He or she obviously has no regard for customers and customers do drive the whole machine, now don't they?<br /><br />This download took longer to load than my first blu-ray machine did for Disney features in the early days of blu-ray and that is saying something.  I told my wife this was the \\"Great Leap Backwards.\\"  (I do hope my Chinese friends will forgive me for this bit of grim humor.)<br /><br />In disgust, I disconnected the Panasonic blu-ray player from my network adapter and guess what, the movie started right away.  So did the Sherwood!  Hurray for BD Live, the epitome of high technology!<br /><br />I do wonder why my machines played when so many others reported theirs would not.  Universal has some problems here, that is obvious.  My Panasonic was just updated and would not play the disc until it was updated.  My Sherwood had some problems but it is less than a year old.  Perhaps anything that new can play the disc.  It is possible that Universal is using some form of Disc Protection similar to that being used on many discs by Fox (copyright encryption) that has given many problems on Avatar - but I really don't know, other than having heard that Fox is really into protecting their properties.  I read that it took all of two weeks for the criminals to break that encryption.  Of course, consumers will be living with discs that work poorly for many years.<br /><br />It is so sad to ruin the experience when the content, Apollo 13 is such a splendid example of the medium.<br /><br />It is disconcerting to consider that the best way to run blu-ray discs may be off-line, without access to the BD Live features, which the industry touts so strongly.  But it does avoid wasting time in start-up and the dubious BD Live features that are often fluff or content light.  A five minute wait for a 45 second semi-high def. simply isn't worth it to me, even if the content is of some nominal value.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe someday there will blu-ray standards that survive more than a year without wholesale changes, perhaps the manufacturers will understand that the players are used by people who are not engineers, and should not require constant firmware updates, and, in a perfect world, it is possible that the studios will learn that customers just want discs that play each time they put them in, quickly, reliably and with quality commentary or special features.  Those features matter matter more than whether they are via BD Live or from the disc itself.<br /><br />Perhaps, but then it's more likely that you'll run across Santa.  If you do tell him I said hello.

1439153663|5.0|Historical fiction fans will enjoy  this book for older teens and adults.  It follows a young black slave and an Irish indentured servant from young teens to maturity and paints a detailed portrait of their life.  It is easy to feel like your living their lives and feeling the pain that many girl with few choices would face. Since no effort is made to white wash to many horrible things these girls were forced to face during their lifetime it is not appropriate for younger teens.  The book felt complete but I missed both women when I finished the book.  This book is would be close to the top of the list of my favorite historical fiction novels.

B0030EWB96|5.0|I looked for this CD after hearing about the artist on NPR.  It's hardcore piano jazz, not for the faint of heart.  I like it immensely, and the delivery from this source was excellent.
B000069KGM|4.0|I am pretty sure that Rush has a vocalist, because it says Geddy sings on the album covers, I just have never heard him.  To me they are just a really good instrumental band.  As I get older my high freq hearing gets worse.  Add that to some hissing in the ears always going on, I do have to turn up the volume these days.  And, when Peter Cetera hits those ridicuously high notes (for a man), he fades out of hearing, like trying to hear a dog whistle.    And, of course, that is one of the definitions of whimp rock.....notes sung higher by a guy than an average girl sings.  A SURE marker is if someone provides high harmony even further up the scale.    OK.  We don't get the uber high harmonies (probably impossible to do and have ANY human ears hear it), but later Chicago was just wimp rock pap, and you know this to be true in your heart of hearts.  I know many reading this will not like being called wimp rock fans, but the truth is, somewhere there is a wuss or wimp rock fan in all of us.  I admit, I kind of like Toto, and am pretty sure there are high harmonies in their songs, but since I can't hear that high, will have to go on suspicion alone.    I listen to a few later Chicago songs and gag, and wonder how a band that kicked SO much butt on their first album allowed themselves to be de-balled.  I wonder who did it.  Wives and Girlfriends?  \\"Honey, that is a nice song and all, but do you have to be so aggressive?\\"  The record company?  Themselves, when they realized there is more money to be made as sissies than as tough guys?  Doesn't really matter, it is what it is, and if you can't admit Chicago, when they caved and changed their name from Chicago Transit Authority to just Chicago, their testosterone went with them, then you probably haven't even HEARD CTA.    I was pretty wary of buying an album with a band that had horns in it, I mean, that is almost like an orchestra or something.  But, this record rocks, and has a bottom, and gravel in its gut, and a guitar player that can get after it, and up tempo songs, and a political (lefty, for sure) lean to many of the songs, and they only let Cetera sing about 1/3 of the time.  By the way, Pete can play a mean bass, and drives many of the songs on this album with it.  He wasn't always a spineless milksop.      So, hard rock/heavy metal fans, do not be scared off by the horns.  This album is OK to be seen with, it won't ruin your reputation.  Anything named \\"Chicago\\" on the cover, you get what you got coming, but CTA is safe, and actually, I bet you like it.
B0018RWD6I|5.0|John Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" is a classic of American music in any genre.  Recorded in 1965 on Impulse! the album features Coltrane's quartet consisting of Coltrane on tenor sax, Jimmy Garrison, double bass, Elvin jones, drums, and McCoy Tyner, piano.  \\"A Love Supreme\\" is a highly-integrated, intense work of about 33 minutes in four parts titled Acknowledgement, Resolution, Pursuance, and Psalm. In its emotional depth, musical complexity, and spirituality, \\"A Love Supreme\\" takes jazz to an extraordinary musical level.<br /><br />This music has deservedly become iconic even for listeners who know little about jazz or Coltrane. In its passion and wildness, it is music that shows its 1960s origins while surmounting them. This is highly spiritual music which Coltrane created after overcoming a long drug addiction. The religious character of the piece is apparent on even a casual hearing, but there is nothing sectarian in the work.  The music is both personal and universal.<br /><br />The work ranges from the meditative to the searching to the ecstatic. There are long, intricate and complex solos by Coltrane throughout, most of which vary a four-note phrase stated at the opening of the music and then chanted at the end of the first part as a mantra to the words \\"A Love Supreme.\\"  The work uses the entire range of Coltrane's sax and more as he overblows and shrieks to suggest his spiritual quest.  The work ends with a slow Psalm, with Coltrane moving to a mystical close.  Each of the quartet members also have incandescent solos in the work, especially the percussion of Jones in the second and third parts, Tyner's piano in \\"Pursuance\\" and Garrison's long bass solo which opens \\"Psalm.\\" The third and fourth parts of the work tend to run together without pause as I hear them although some listeners hear them as separate, discrete sections.<br /><br />I listen to and review a good deal of American classical music on Amazon. It offers insights into the American experience that sometimes are overlooked. Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" is an inspiring masterpiece in a distinctly American art form. I loved revisiting \\"A Love Supreme\\" which stands easily with the best accomplishments of American art.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanooked.

B00005BKZJ|4.0|I really hated the first twenty minutes of this film, with its theatrical acting and direction, but as the film progressed, I found myself charmed by the characters and situation.  Bagdad Cafe (alternately known as Out of Rosenheim) has the quirkiness and rough texture of a low-budget film with magic, literally, at its heart.<br /><br />Jasmin (Marianne S&auml;gebrecht), a stocky German tourist, has a fight with her husband and leaves him in the middle of the desert, a few miles from the four building \\"town\\" of Bagdad, California.  At the same time, the owner of the Bagdad Cafe, Brenda (CCH Pounder), kicks out her husband for being unreliable and lazy.  The two women meet without knowing the other's story when Jasmin limps into the Bagdad Cafe and Motel and asks for a room.  Brenda is a feisty, independent, unhappy woman, and she expects nothing but trouble from Jasmin.  But the others at the motel and restaurant, from washed-up set designed Rudi (Jack Palance) to Brenda's rebellious daughter Phyllis (Monica Calhoun) to the backpacker who pitches his tent behind the motel, fall in love with the industrious and sweet Jasmin.  At first, Brenda is bewildered by all this, but she, too, is won over when everything changes because of a magic trick box that Jasmin's husband had in his suitcase.<br /><br />The film seems more like a play than a film, especially at first because of the direction, filming, and acting (Pounder uses a stage voice instead of a screen one.)  But this is the type of film that sneaks up on you.  Before you know it, you are smiling and leaning forward.  The characters are revealed through quiet moments and transformations.<br /><br />Not for viewers who prefer conventional movies, Bagdad Cafe offers a quirky, even surreal, glimpse into what people want.  Note:  a 15-episode series of the same name, starring Whoopi Goldberg as Brenda and Jean Stapleton as Jasmin, was based on this film.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I don't know what has happened to Tom Hanks, but it is not good.  Perhaps too much Hollywood and too little real world.  I have been a Tom Hanks fan for years, so I expected this series to be as good as Band of Brothers, but it is not.  After seeing his interviews in which he plainly said that WWII was a battle against evil in Europe, but was a racist war in the Pacific, I really should have expected this anti-American garbage, but I was not prepared for it.  The torture of Japanese by American troops is depicted, while the atrocities of the Japanese done to our troops was ignored.    Tom, the war in the Pacific was not fought because of racism.  It was fought because of Pearl Harbor, which you chose to ignore in this series to promote your own anti-American bias.  And the men who fought were hero's, not sex-crazed racists as you portray.    I will never spend another cent on anything that Tom Hanks benefits from; he has now joined the ranks of Jane Fonda and other elitists who attack the nation that they were blessed to be born in.
B003EVWDR0|1.0|I am so glad I did not waste my money a see this in the theaters.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  With all the hype and good reviews, I really expected something I could sit through without checking the clock every 5 minutes.  This movie is terrible.  It has to be one of the worst written scripts in years.  This is saying quite a bit considering all the dribble that has come out recently.    The storyline is very derivative, predictable and filled with so many holes that you can drive a big rig through it.  There was absolutely no backstory.  All the characters are one dementional, unsympathetic and derogatory on both sides. No twists or turns to keep you interested.  I agree with an earlier review that this makes the Star Wars prequels look like masterpiecies.      I've a big fan of SciFi and fantasy movies.  I love most of James Cameron's works.  He could do much better than this and has with the Terminator, Titanic, Alien and the Abyss.  Mr. Cameron, please, hire a good script writer to at least review work the next time you through a quarter of a billion dollars at an eight year project.

0061537969|5.0|Enzo loves nothing more than racing around a racetrack with his master, up-and-coming race car driver Denny Swift. Enzo has been with Denny since puppyhood and the two share a heartwarming relationship. Enzo is Denny's best friend and confidante and Enzo dreams of one day returning to Earth as a human with hopes of meeting Denny in that form.<br /><br />The book begins on the eve of Enzo's death, and from that point backtracks to the life shared by a caring man and his dog. We read about the changes in their lives as Denny marries, has a daughter, loses his wife to an early death, then his daughter to her grandparents. We're part of Denny's angst and frustration as he determinedly tries to regain custody of his daughter, whom he lost due to unjust allegations. And through it all, his dog Enzo, by his side, grieving with him, rejoicing with him, ready to help his master any way he can. The plot moves like life: up and down, filled with intense pain and great happiness.<br /><br />Enzo's take on life is refreshing and insightful and the analogies he makes between life and race car driving are poignant and eye-opening. Be sure to keep plenty of tissues handy, because this is a book that, although heart-crushingly sad, is at the same time uplifting and touching.

I for one think that, although it is not perfect, it is one of the best shows on broadcast TV right now (especially if you are a Sci-Fi fan like me).  When I've purchased complete seasons of a show in the past (and I have many) I am sometimes disappointed in the packaging.  Sometimes it contains 2 sided discs (which I hate) or paper inserts which don't protect the discs very well.  I decided to make this short video review of the set itself.  I hope that it is helpful.

0385732554|5.0|I'd read \\"The Giver\\" in elementary school and really enjoyed it then.  As I was looking for books on Amazon recently, I came across it and decided to buy it since I'd loved it as a kid.  As soon as I got it in, I started reading it and I actually liked it more as an adult than a child!      \\"The Giver\\" shows what society could be like if we decided to make everyone the same.  It will really make you think twice about wishing you were like someone else.      Lois Lowry does a wonderful job of keeping the book engaging, yet easy to read.  I also really like the way the story progresses and unfolds--you are let into Jonas' world.      I would recommend \\"The Giver\\" to anyone age 10 and up.  It would also be a great book to read as a family because it fosters all sorts of discussions.

B00002SWEM|5.0|Great item.  I opted for the free standard delivery and talk about snail mail.  I ordered on the 1st of the month and received it on the 29th.  That's my only dislike.  Other than that, product was as promised.

I now do not like all the F_______ language this and f____________ language that in the show.  I could stand to watch only 1 disc of the 2.  I guess that girl friendship without all the scr____ing and \\"F\\" language is all I like about it.  I'm going to sell it on Amazon.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|This has got to be one of the most powerful (and most visually disturbing) movies to have ever come out of the 2000's. It's more than just a film; it's a piece of reality. Dreams are formed, desired, and shattered (hence the title of the film). It's a stunning piece of work, and a depressing one. Those who have weak stomachs (or had just had a rough day on the job) should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. I personally wasn't depressed by it, but I did care for the characters as they force themselves to make some very bad decisions in life (I'm not going to give the ending away, I promise). All of the actors (especially Ellen Burstyn) are terrific; they are perfectly cast for their roles, and nothing affects their performances. Director Darren Aronofsky has done splendidly with this one. He knows how to create a hardcore drama with his use of quick shots and lighting. All in all, this is a powerful film, and it deserves the high praise that it's continuously receiving as of today. Congratulations to Aronofsky, the cast, and the crew.<br /><br />Grade: A

He couldn't be a better good/bad guy. Even my dad thinks the show is interesting and he hates dramas and twilight-lol. That just says something. I haven't missed an episode b/c of TiVo but i'm going to get the DVDs once it's out.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Having seen Avatar on the big screen, I was a bit concerned that the impact would be diminished when presented without 3D goggles, and on a small screen.  I was wrong; Avatar still retains its ability to wow and enthrall, despite the smaller format.  Those who have not seen the movie yet, be warned that the box implies that you have already done so.  That being said, there are elements of the plot that will be familiar to any who have ever seen Fern Gully or Disney's Pocahontas.  Much of the impact of this film is the stunning visuals, such as the aptly named Hallelujah Mountains, bioluminescent night scenes, and of course the wonderfully rendered blue Avatars.     Personally, I was terribly disappointed to find no special features included with the movie in the DVD format, as I always love seeing deleted scenes and whatever else is included.  We have been told that Avatar is James Cameron's brainchild, ten years in the making, but there is no talk from him about the development, or any of the behind the scenes digital wonders.  On the plus side, there are no ads for other movies to get through before we get to the desired content.  If nothing else, the minimalist nature of the DVD release is an indication that Cameron really thought of this as a movie for theatres, and best seen in 3D.     Overall, however, I would say that it was lovely to see Avatar again, now that I can't dash into a theater and grab some 3D goggles for the original effect.  This really is one of the most visually stunning and gripping movies of recent years, capable of producing some of those moments of wonder akin to stepping through the farmhouse door into Oz.  Colors are more vibrant in this world, animals are different, and blue has never looked so good on people as it does in Avatar.  Even without a widescreen TV, or blue-ray, I was drawn in to this world, and could still sense the vertigo of large vistas, and generally feel jealous of the characters that got to be there in the film.
0393072231|5.0|There was a point in recent years when we all started to notice something strange. As houses got more and more expensive, and interest rates got lower and lower, many of us knew someone who had no money, but, bizarrely, got a huge mortgage. And then there were all the stories about people buying houses with no money down and interest-only payments for three years. How exactly, we wondered, were these people expecting to be able to make principal payments three years from now? And why was anyone lending them money?    In \\"The Big Short,\\" Michael Lewis explains that all of this was just the tip of an iceberg: an iceberg floating in exceedingly murky waters. As we now know, there was a reason for all of those bad mortgages. The people making the mortgages were selling them, so they didn't care how bad they were. The mortgages were being bought by companies that bundled them and turned them into bonds--which they were able to sell, so they didn't care how bad the mortgages were either.    In order to be sold, the bonds had to be rated. There are two major rating agencies, and they are paid to rate bonds by the very companies that produce the bonds. As this was a new kind of bond, the rating agencies needed help understanding them. So the same companies also explained the bonds to them. In a reasonable financial system, the position of ratings agency analyst would be prestigious and well-paid. As it is, these analysts are some of the lowest-paid and least-respected employees on Wall Street.    Not surprisingly under the circumstances, a great many of these bonds (which increasingly consisted of utterly worthless mortgages) were rated triple A, the highest possible rating. The bonds that consisted of the absolutely worst mortgages were given a triple B rating. But the financial companies realized that triple B-rated mortgage bonds could in turn be bundled into another financial product, a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). Presented with these CDOs, the rating agenciestended to give them triple A ratings--which suggested that they were as safe an investment as U.S. Treasury bonds. Shockingly, very few people, at any level of the financial world or the U.S. government, understood that the ratings--and the bonds they described--were worthless.    This is a book about many things, but it is especially a story of incentives, and the calamitous effects of incentivizing irresponsible behavior. In a system in which virtually everyone had an incentive to do the wrong thing, almost everyone did: and almost everyone, from mortgage lenders to the Fed, failed to understand that catastrophe was imminent. \\"The Big Short\\" describes the very small--and eccentric--group of people who saw it coming.    The cast of characters begins with Steve Eisman, a socially inept hedge fund manager, who had turned cynic after witnessing a flagrant case of fraud on which the government refused to take action. Mike Burry is a brilliant hedge fund manager who is virtually incapable of human relationships, a problem which he blamed on his glass eye but was revealed to be undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome. Charlie Ledley and Ben Hockett were two rather aimless friends who proved to have an uncanny ability to work the financial market. Greg Lippmann was a cynical Deutsche Bank bond trader who realized that the market was unsustainable.    They shared a key insight: that the market was going to collapse, and therefore the only safe bet was a bet against the market. (To short a bond is to bet that it will lose value.) Michael Lewis rivetingly describes how they first made, and then won, this bet, becoming extremely rich in the process.    At a recent (and entertaining) event with Michael Lewis at DC's Politics & Prose Bookstore, Joel Achenbach said that this book had undermined his belief in capitalism, and asked if we should all become socialists. It's a fair question. Lewis depicts a system in utter disarray, where financial products are too complex to be understoodby either buyers or sellers; the agencies in charge of evaluating these products are both under-valued and embroiled in a serious conflict of interest; and there are no incentives to encourage responsible behavior. All of this links the health of the U.S. economy to a large gamble in which virtually nobody has any idea what they are doing. It is to be hoped that this book will be part of a movement toward a genuinely sane financial system.

1439153663|4.0|I enjoyed this book for its different perspective on plantation life, that of a white indentured servant, Lavinia, who doesn't fit in with the free whites or with the enslaved servants. The story gets off to a strong and immediate start with a glimpse of a tragedy to come and the rest of the narrative leads the reader down a dark and emotional path toward that conclusion:<br /><br />\\"There was a strong smell of smoke, and new fear fueled me. Now on the familiar path, I raced ahead, unmindful of my daughter behind me trying to keep up...I forbade myself to think I was too late and focused all my strength on moving toward home.\\"<br /><br />When Lavinia first arrives at the plantation she is traumatized and frightened, but gradually comes back to life under the patient care of the kitchen house slaves. The narrative moves between Lavinia and Belle, the master's illegitimate daughter. Both girls live between the worlds of black and white. Belle's light skin and favor from the master set her apart nearly as much as Lavinia's white skin does. But each woman offers a different view of that grey area, as Belle is wise to the ways of plantation society and struggles with the need to be free of it, while Lavinia is young and unknowing and wants only to find her place in it.<br /><br />Lavinia has a hard time understanding that she is different from her adoptive family. She comes to be dependent upon their acceptance and love, the solidarity and comfort she finds with them. But her family knows that eventually Lavinia will be a free woman and they hope for a better future for her, and try to prepare her for a different future.<br /><br />As Lavinia grows older she is embraced by the master's family and given a chance to be educated and experience more of the world. Though she attempts to make the most of it, she misses her plantation family fiercely and still can't envision a future that does not include sharing a life with them. She ends up making a decision that she thinks will provide the perfect way to return to live with her family and better their lot in life at the same time, but ultimately ends up bringing suffering and hardship instead.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of five-star reviews for this book, and I thought it was good, but two things keep me from rating it that high. One, oddly enough, is Lavinia herself. She displays courage and determination when attempting to maintain her relations with her slave family, but she can't find the same stength to take care of herself. She remains on the naive and strongheaded side throughout the story and she doesn't seem to learn from her mistakes or the mistakes of others. That and the fact that this book was a little too dark and depressing for me. No one ever seems to be able to catch a break, there's just one heartache or trauma after another and at the end I didn't feel like all that darkness had a bigger purpose. If that makes any sense.<br /><br />But this book is very well written and it's hard to believe this is Ms. Grissom's first novel. In the author's note she reveals her inspiration for the story: the discovery on an old map of a place named \\"Negro Hill\\" adjacent to her farm. From that notation on a map a story began to flow of what could have happened on that hill to give it its name. I also really enjoyed the descriptiveness of the narrative, particularly that of colonial Williamsburg and the plight of the mentally ill and the conditions of the mental hospital there, having visited last summer and toured the reproduction of that hospital. And even though the story covers a span of about 20 years, it moves at a very fast pace and I had a hard time putting it down.eturn to live with her family and better their lot in life at the same time, but ultimately ends up bringing suffering and hardship instead.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|I have not read any of the books, or seen any previous films, so I couldn't compare it. I thought Robert Downey Jr. pulled off an awesome performance as Sherlock Holmes and brought new life to the character. It dragged a little in the beginning, but it got a lot better. It has action, suspense, and a bit of comedy. Holmes is a brilliant detective who sometimes seems a little eccentric. Dr. Watson is his loyal assistant. Together, they try to solve a mystery as to how Lord Blackwood rose from the grave with the help of black magic, and threatens all of London. Holmes and Watson soon team up with a woman named Irene Adler who is a thief and his former adversary. If you love mysteries, you'll love SHERLOCK HOLMES!!!
0812979656|3.0|I wanted to like this book. Some of the writing was beautiful, spectacular even. They way the book started was extremely descriptive and engaging, then it went down hill. I wanted the entire book to be written similarly to the chapter about the funeral. The reader felt involved then just never recovered from my expectation of the funeral chapter. There were glimpses of brilliant writing, but where you wanted more detail there wasn't enough and where you wanted less detail, the chapter went on too long.<br /><br />Overall I really wanted to like this book, but I could not. Maybe I will try more of this authors writing.
B0037SQ3C6|5.0|The Prince of the Piano strikes again, with a flawless and dazzling performance of Chopin's Complete Nocturnes. His fluidity at the piano is unparalleled, as is his ability to engage the crowd and keep them on their toes throughout an entire performance. This is Yundi's first release since he teamed with EMI Classics, and all I can say is that I hope that many more releases will soon follow. Yundi is the shining star among young concert pianists, so I suggest you pick up this artistic masterpiece to add to your collection.

There is a religious component that is audible when listening to this piece, which makes sense because \\"Via Crucis\\" translates to the way of the Cross. Even if you are not a fan of music with religious undertones, you will still immensely enjoy this CD.
0743487486|5.0|It's wonderful to read a parenting book based on evidence, not just some author's unproven theories. This book has greatly improved my relationship with my daughter.<br /><br />Some reviewers have complained that raising your child to be an independent person is great in theory, but sometimes you just need your child to obey. Did these reviewers read the book? Kohn addresses that very topic when he cites evidence that children who have a lot of autonomy most of the time are more likely to obey on those occasions when obedience is truly needed.

But nothing can compare to the tragic ending in this book! I felt for her the whole book but at the end it was just so bad!! I can't wait to read the next one.
0061914177|2.0|After really enjoying the 4-Hour Work Week, I purchased Crush It! primarily on the strength of the reviews on Amazon.    From the first page, I found Vaynerchuck's tone to be extremely arrogant and obnoxious, and his colloquialisms distracting... distracting from the fact that the contents of the book sucks.  Vaynerchuck makes no attempt at modesty, and fails to \\"read\\" how his self-aggrandizing tone may comes across to others.    He basically tells you to find your passion and directs you to which social networking accounts you can harness to spread your message.  Nothing he mentions is groundbreaking or even novel    Anyone with a pulse knows what the popular SN sites are.    Stick with 4-Hour Work Week. Ferriss is a skillfull writer, and his form carries quality content.  He also helps you reflect on what your passion may be, and comes up with devices to help you bring it out, if you can't locate it.    But apparently a lot of people like Crush It, with all the great reviews, so maybe they're all Crushing It.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|o, one of the benefits (I guess that you can call it a benefit) of having a broken ankle is that you get to watch a ton of the movies off your Netflix queue that you wouldn't normally have the time to watch and, in my case, to do it in a relatively sober state because I can neither drink or take the \\"good\\" pain medications.<br /><br />Blade Runner is a 1982 science fiction/dystopian future type of film starring Harrison Ford and directed by Ridley Scott. Ford plays a semi-retired Blade Runner in LA in 2019. Blade Runners are police officers whose sole job is to chase down and \\"retire\\" (a synonym for kill) replicants. Replicants are humanoids that are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, created by the Tyrell Corporation, but which have been banned from Earth due a violent uprising that occurred in the years before the events in this film. They are now limited to off world colonies, doing dangerous work that humans can't or won't do. At the beginning of Blade Runner, we learn that a group of 4, cunning replicants have returned to Earth and are going on a rampage.  Ford's character - Rick Deckard - is a retired Blade Runner who is called back into service to help track down and retire these out of control replicants. During his quest, Ford comes across Rachel, a replicant that is employed by Tyrell company as the CEO's personal assistant, that is somewhat of an anomaly - she's called \\"an experiment\\" - because, unlike the other replicants that Tyrell has produced, Rachel actually has memories, albeit ones that come from Tyrell's niece. As the movie progresses, Ford develops feelings for Rachel that he struggles with periodically during his quest.<br /><br />I had never seen this movie before, ever, even though we have the DVD at my home and my husband absolutely adores the movie.  It apparently also has a cult following - now not so much a cult following as a mainstream following.  And I can see why - it's a pretty good movie. What shocked me is that people agreed that when this film was released in the theaters in the early 80's, it was a complete and utter flop. People hated it.  No clue why because Scott created a really good movie with Harrison Ford as his lead man. Thematically, the movie was attractive because it dealt with themes of memory and identity and how they are intertwined: are they intertwined, how much does one impact the other if at all, etc. I really enjoyed how the scenes were shot and the sets themselves. The darkness, with some brief interludes of light, fit in very well together and added to the overall feel.reed that when this film was released in the theaters in the early 80's, it was a complete and utter flop.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|This movie came out in 2009 and was written and directed by James Cameron. It stars Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Saldana, Michelle Rodriguez, Sam Worthington and Stephen Lang. The film is set in the year 2154. Humans have discovered Pandora and are mining a precious mineral, unobtanium, from that world. Continued mining, however, threatens the Na'vi, the native, sentient humanoid species that inhabits Pandora. Avatars are the genetically engineered bodies that are used by the scientists to interact with the Na'vi. The movie begins with us learning that Jake Scully (Worthington), who is paralyzed from the waist down, has been selected to replace his brother in working one of the Avatars.  On a mission while he is in the Avatar, he is separated from the group and has to spend the night in Pandora, alone. While doing so, he meets Neytiri (Saldana), a real Na'vi and begins to form bonds with the Na'vi that are threatened when the mining colony seeks to expand into the Na'vi spiritual grounds and culminates with an epic battle.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie.  I mean, James Cameron has blockbusters mostly because he knows how to pull on our heartstrings and resolve things in a way that makes things feel \\"right.\\" So bravo to him for exploiting psychology I guess but, in my opinion, some of the best movies are the movies that don't always resolve in that psychologically fulfilling manner. I found that the story line was really predictable, from the very first moments when you learn that Worthington's paralyzed character is set to become an Avatar and my predictions ended up being correct most of the time - like 99% of the time.  I found myself thinking \\"here's what's going to happen now\\" and it did.  The characters weren't very memorable either. For instance, Sigourney Weaver came back to work with Cameron as Dr. Grace Augustine and I saw traces of Ellen Ripley (perhaps Cameron's MOST memorable character).  They were flat and unoriginal and totally not memorable. So in that sense, I wasn't very impressed.<br /><br />I was very impressed by how the movie looked. It was a beautiful movie to look at.

B001C4AFOY|4.0|This movie is a great biopic. I mean it has it all, well almost all. What it does not have is a great plot. The plot of the movie is Victoria's life, and as always, life is not as interesting as art. This makes the movie somewhat slow. I mean, she was a queen, not a superhero. So, one should not be surprised at the fact that her life was somewhat boring. The acting, however, was great as well as the production of the movie. All in all, worth a night, but not worth buying.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I'm not critiquing the movie. (Although it is enjoyable eye candy in 2D, with a message that's about as subtle as a wayward, out-of-control jackhammer in the proverbial china shop.)<br /><br />I'm not going to gripe a word about double-, triple- or even quadruple-dipping. (It's big-business, so what should anyone really expect?)<br /><br />I'm simply COMPLAINING about the horrid DRM the movie studio chose to use that effectively kept the STUPID BLU RAY DISC from working on my Samsung BD player right out the box, a machine that was equipped with the latest firmware update available at the time of the movie's purchase on board. Played fine in my PS3, but stopped dead in its tracks with my Samsung. Also heard that certain LG BD players also suffer from the same DRM conflicts, and perhaps some Pioneer machines were affected as well.<br /><br />Samsung ultimately issued another firmware update about a week later, and yes it worked to cure the problem. But what was the point of bothering with the DRM in the first place? Pirated Blu Ray copies abound across torrent sites, so useless and futile was the DRM strategy set in place at doing what it was supposed to do. All it instead did was agonize any number of longstanding, legit Blu Ray owners, and foster ill will for a week or so for a number of us Samsung owners.<br /><br />I HATE DRM. You should too, especially since it DOESN'T WORK (in so many ways, including in its intended purpose...stopping piracy).

0767810856|3.0|Nicolas Cage has always been hit of miss for me and in this film his quirky style works very well. Cage plays an all around good guy cop in this slightly uneven, but good natured comedy. Fonda is also very good and Rose Perez despite playing a very unlikable character does it so well you will cheer with glee when her fate is revealed at the end of the film.<br /><br />The film does seem a bit dated as the sum of money involved although a nice score, would hardly be enough to do so much with these days. Even in 1994 when the film was released it seems a little low. 4 million dollars split between two people after taxes would leave around 1 million dollars a piece, hardly enough to quit your job on, but certainly enough to change your life.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is that Cage and Perez seem so mismatched that you can't really figure out what brought these two together. It would have been nice to see Perez played a little more real and maybe get some insight about her. Was she always this greedy and ambitious(a very nice way to put it)? or did she become this way over time. They do talk about the relationship briefly, but it doesn't really give you much. If your husband is so upstanding it's hard to believe she would be the polar opposite. I'm not saying that she doesn't have a point, letting your husband give away 2 million dollars to a stranger would be a hard thing to do, but Cage seems to be this man with great character and I don't see the connection with him and his wife.<br /><br />Regardless of these flaws, the film is entertaining and does have a nice inspiring ending. The DVD is pretty standard with nothing special on it other than a good DVD transfer.
B001NLKT60|4.0|started very slowly and introduced many minor characters along the way but about halfway through the story picks up steam and becomes very exciting.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I got hooked on this show from the beginning and while season two doesn't quite have the punch of the first season, it does dig much  deeper into the world of the characters. If you like 'Rescue Me' and 'The Sopranos' you should love this show. It's one of the best written shows on TV with great characters, dialogue, drama with a nice touch of comedy.<br /><br />This season is twice as long as the first, so the stories are much more elaborate. I had read that Aaron Paul was first thought to be a side character in a couple of episodes, but because of the chemistry between the two stars, was written in as a main character. I'm glad they did, as he is every bit as good as Brian Cranston an adds another dimension to the show.<br /><br />This DVD release has all 13 episodes from season two and lots of nice extras including commentary, deleted scenes and much more. It's a great show worthy of a purchase. AMC isn't available in HD in my area and the episodes look really good on this release and the Blu Ray looks exceptional.

B002K0WBY6|4.0|It's hard to trash this predictable romance film because the stars are so appealing. While the is little new here, the film is entertaining with some good laughs. I was surprised to see Sandra Bullock in a semi-nude scene and she is looking mighty fine! Betty White adds to the fun and shows no sign of slowing down. If you like romantic comedies, you should really like this good natured film.

B002RSDW80|3.0|While there is no argument over Meryl Streep giving a wonderful performance as the first lady of TV cooking,this film seemed to be missing a few key ingredients. I was actually more interested in Amy Adam's character in many places and the story seemed a little lightweight considering what Julia Child did for the industry. It's a pleasant film certainly worthy watching, but it just didn't have the right recipe to satisfy my hunger for the subject matter.
0307454541|4.0|I have read many reviews here and won't go into the story details. I would like to address the pacing of the book for you. Many people suggested about page 100 things get going, I say it just gets slightly warm there. Around page 350(Ch 16) the book starts to cook! After that it's just a great read. So, why does Larsson take his sweet time? To develop the main characters and he does that well. You come to know and fully understand them, you are pulled into there lives so well you can almost predict their next move. There is a lot of back story but it makes the last half of the book that much more exciting and rewarding to read. I would recommend it IF you are an extremely patient reader..many would have put it down by page 100, they'd be missing out on a wonderfully spun murder mystery that has some great subplots weaving through it.

1451539053|5.0|This novel is one of my all-time favorite books.  I was surprised by the humanity of the Monster; the traditional portrayal of Frankenstein is usually a bumbling stumbling monster, and Mary Shelley's real creation is nothing of the sort.  The book is exciting, thought-provoking, and holds your attention until the very end.  Read it on a stormy day.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This movie is a perfect example of how relevent and amazing 2D animation can be. Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have ALWAYS produced amazing, quality artwork with all the love and care in the world. It's the only anime I've ever seen that teaches children to love and appreciate the world and all of the magic and wonder in it.    I recommend this film to anyone with or WITHOUT a child, along with any of Studio Ghibli's previous works. These movies are amazing for all ages and all types of people, though I CAUTION: WATCH IT IN JAPANESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. The Disney dubbing job is absolutely awful with a cast that doesn't fit the characters at all, but were instead selected for 'political' reasons. I mean come on, it's no coincidence that a Jonas AND a Cyrus are in the dubbed version of an American Disney release of a Japanese film.    So watch it in Japanese and you'll be amazed by the spirit and heart of this film!

1582701709|1.0|Positive thinking is a great practice, anyone can tell you that. However, the contents of this book presents itself like a cheap, midnight infomercial that is dressed up creatively in attempts to lure in curious customers. The manner in which the author addresses the audience seems so pretentiously blunt that you couldn't possibly take this book seriously.

I'd love to get the rest of Card's works, but if this rendition of a major classic is any indication, I will STAY AWAY from any Tor editions.
0307454541|3.0|The timing for action in the book is good; the story grabs your attention; the characters are intriguing. However, to me, the account is a bit shallow and Ms Salander is too suddenly embarked, at the end, in an atmosphere she would hardly be able to navigate successfully, as per her background, impacting her character's credibility.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I loved this movie.  I laughed and cried all the way through. Great movie for any age.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|I totally understand how people didn't like this movie. It was long and kind of similar to a Lifetime movie. But, for some reason, I thought it was very good. Yes, it did take a while for it to get start, but I suppose they are trying to give a full story with lots of drama. Ali Later, she was very creepy, I have to admit, but the \\"Derek...\\" sexy tone voice maybe a little too \\"SOAP\\" for people, or too (suppose to be) sexy for others. I thought it was some-what funny. I did indeed purchase this film (for only $4.99 at a Hollywood Video), but I think it was worth it. Acting is somewhat good and storyline is also not original, but is pretty good and I thought it was a good attempt. I will not be a big critic and I'll give movie an \\"A-\\"

0374531269|5.0|So this was probably the first memoir I've ever read. Maybe not, but it is most certainly the first one in recent memory. I feel so conflicted after reading this book. The most obvious reaction is a newfound sense of gratefulness for what I have, those things that I've always taken for granted only to realize that, well, quite frankly, THEY'RE NOT. By far.     Ishmael Beah's account of his harrowing and traumatizing time spent as a refugee and child soldier amidst the gruesome turmoil of the Sierra Leone Civil War provoked in me a sense of utter horror tempered by a wisp of doubt. Okay, it was more than a wisp. Like maybe a great big swath of doubting. The narrative is excruciatingly detailed at points, which is rather questionable. Can a person really remember the color of the sky and the exact dialogue and actions of a day more than 15 years ago, no matter how traumatizing the day was? Certainly I know I can't! Heck, I can't even remember the precise conversation I had an hour ago, let alone years and years past. Beah's defense is that he has a photographic memory, thus allowing him the ability to recount such details to the nth degree.     But nit-picking and the accuracy of the account aside, A Long Way Gone instills in me a great big tangled knot of feelings. Disbelief, that such cruel events could have taken place in our world. Horror, that hundreds of thousands of mere children are being forced to take up gun and drugs to fight for such a cause. Outrage, for the pointless bloodshed and separating of families and thousands of lives extinguished for naught.     A Long Way Gone makes me want to charge out to the world right now and start doing some good.
030726999X|4.0|Stieg Larsson's third novel in the Millennium series is an international `police procedural.'  It was translated into English from the Swedish by Reg Keeland in a good, flowing style.  The chapters are divided into short segments, keeping readers involved with the professional and personal lives of several key characters.<br /><br />The story is exciting and full of suspense from beginning to end.  There are detailed descriptions of various law enforcement agencies in Sweden, with only one delay in the action as a result of a multi-page detailed description of the secret service agency \\"Sapo\\".<br /><br />The plot includes high tech internet activities presented in a realistic, believable way that adds to the suspense. There are interesting presentations of political and journalistic organizations in the novel relative to the plot.  The novel is self-contained meaning readers can enjoy it without reading the first two books in the trilogy.  Also, the third novel does not `spoil' the first two, but rather it encourages first time Stieg readers to go back in time and read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played With Fire.<br /><br />I recommend this lengthy novel to readers who enjoy novels of suspense, international intrigue, and police procedurals.  It is not a book to be read quickly, but it is worthwhile and enjoyable.
0316017922|2.0|I couldn't really get into this book.  It had some interesting tidbits, but overall each chapter seemed to go way off on a tangent with personal stories that I suppose were meant to make the book more interesting to people who find original research papers too dull to read.     Personally, I'd rather read original research papers than books like this, filtered through the eyes of a journalist, with a lot of off topic human interest stories and anecdotes. One of the reasons Freakonomics is such a cool book is that it was written by a researcher who actually knows how to write well along with a  professional writer.  The Outlier book was authored by someone who is simply a writer and it shows in the lack of real research based content and his inability to ferret out and identify junk science.      For example, one part of the book goes into great detail on how Southerners have a persistent culture of getting angry easy and honor killings that goes back hundreds of years and supposedly persists today.  The \\"proof\\" of this is given as a study done in Michigan with college students where they are irritated and called a bad name by someone who is being purposely irritating. The study results are that the \\"Southerners\\" have angrier reactions than the \\"Northerners\\".  The study itself had a huge number of logic flaws and drew broad based conclusion about culture based on a a very small set of circumstances with students attending college in Michigan.  For example, did the study take into account the fact that we live in a mobile society?  There are a number of military bases in the Southern U.S. so kids who gave their current home address as the South may really have lived all over the world growing up and not exposed to Southern culture for much of their lives. Maybe the South was just the student's last address or where they parents retired to after the last kid went off to college.     One example in the book was that some of these Southern kids were well off and may havehad parents that were executives at Coca-Cola yet they have this persistent anger and \\"honor killing\\" throwback cultural effect that has persisted through the centuries. Well, executives get transferred around a lot so it doesn't mean their kids are a part of the Southern culture just because that was their last address.  Maybe they spent most of their life growing up in Manhattan.     Or maybe there is something in the South that makes people more angry than citizens to the North that has nothing to do with culture. Maybe something is missing from the soil, maybe they have a habit of drinking more drinks with caffeine, maybe they simply don't eat as healthy, maybe they tend to be more magnesium deficient, maybe they are more likely to smoke, maybe the Southern soil is more depleted of nutrients, maybe the study was not a double blind study and the researchers were biased, maybe the homes in the South have more Chinese drywall and this has a lasting effect on the nervous system.  I'm not saying any of these hypotheses are true. I just made them up just like the authors of the Michigan study made up this honor killings, cultural persistence hypothesis. There could be thousands upon thousands of possible reasons why this one simple, small study highlighted in the Outliers book showed that people from the South got angrier than their Northern counterparts that have absolutely nothing to do with persistent culture whatsoever.      If you really want to read a book on what it takes to be an expert in a given subject, I'd recommend reading The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance.  It is dry reading not intended for the masses, but you'll be getting lots of cool tips on what it takes to be an expert straight from the original researchers on the subject. And most of the researcher comes from researchers studying true experts in various fields, not simplistic college student studies.

Later he will become a powerful messiah of great powers called Maud'dib of the Fremen as he will lead an army to stop the manufactoring of the spice.<br /><br />A disappointing and quite bad Sci-fi fantasy movie that is quite a loose adaptation of Frank Herbert's timeless Sci-fi/fantasy novel classic. It took 20 years to get the book to the big screen until Dino De Laurentiis studios got the rights as originally Alejandro Jorodowsky or Ridley Scott was set to direct but went on to do Blade Runner instead so they got David Lynch who wrote and direct the movie. Some of the casting isn't too bad as it includes Sian Philips, Dean Stockwell, Paul Smith, Brad Douriff, Sting (Kind of weak at acting), Freddie Jones, Linda Hunt, Max Von Sydow and Patrick Stewart as Gurnie as the other cast members but Mclachen was a good casting choice for Paul. The special effects are very good for it's time even if some look cheap and the music score by Brain Eno & Toto is good but this adaptation is very muddled and not very satisfying for fans of the novel but it's still very entertaining and as bad as you heard from critics and audiences over the years but still disappointing even with some disgusting stuff shown by the director who aren't in the book.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set contains a nice tin collectable packaging with both the extended version which is longer and of course the theatrical edition as it has some cool extras like photo galleries, featurettes and deleted scenes.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Dune (2000)\\", \\"Children of Dune\\", \\"The Fifth Element\\", \\"Avatar\\", \\"Heavy Metal\\", \\"Stargate\\", \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Armageddon\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Serenity\\", \\"Children of Men\\", \\"12 Monkeys\\", \\"Metropolis (1927)\\", \\"Nausicca: Valley of the Winds\\", \\"Dark City\\", \\"The Dark Crystal\\", \\"Star Wars Saga\\", \\"Star Trek Movies\\", \\"Flash Gordon\\", \\"Barbarella\\", \\"The Black Hole\\", \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\", \\"2010\\", \\"Excalibur\\", \\"Planet of the Apes (1968) with sequels and remake\\" and \\"The Matrix Trilogy\\".cs and audiences over the years but still disappointing even with some disgusting stuff shown by the director who aren't in the book.

0446563048|5.0|Tony Hseih's \\"Delivering Happiness\\" is a delightful book. I couldn't put it down, and I'm not a high-powered CEO, or even a middle manager looking to come up with great business ideas. This book did make me want to move to Vegas and work for Zappos -- but I've had those fantasies before, mostly every time I have cause to call Zappos customer service (or Customer Loyalty Team, as they're called internally).<br /><br />This book is mostly memoir, tracing Hseih's entrepreneurial passion through his childhood, college, and then finally to Zappos, which he didn't found, but found reason to believe in. I couldn't relate much to Hseih's childhood, but found the story fun, and his enthusiasm for his various projects is infectious. It's later, as he starts realizing that despite his belief that he wants to make a lot of money, sometimes the path that yields the most money isn't the one he wants to take, that it gets really interesting.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a book about the pursuit of happiness, and about spreading happiness. In Hseih's telling, Zappos is doing a pretty good job of doing this, not because shoes are so wonderful -- there are no assertions here that shoes are the key to happiness -- but because the company is built on a solid culture of respect, trust, fun, and a little weirdness, and these values extend to employees, customers, vendors, and anyone else with a stake in the company.<br /><br />I work for a tiny (five employee) non-profit school, which seems like a different world from the 700+ employees and $1 billion revenue Zappos boasts, but still, I found myself thinking about ways we could build our own culture, for and from our employees, students, families, and supporters. The Zappos story didn't feel irrelevant at all.<br /><br />And it's fun. Hseih is engaging, down to earth, and committed. I recommend this book to just about anyone who's ever interacted with other human beings, especially in a business environment. Especially if you don't mind an off-beat and informal narrative.tive.
0307463745|5.0|Over the years I have bought and read well over 300 business books. Books on business strategy, management, entrepreneurship, starting-up, turning-around, marketing, sales, you name it. I've read the works of acclaimed masters, such as Peter Drucker. I've also read those of lesser minds who have never started or run a real business themselves but will gladly sell you their guesses and \\"secrets\\" about how you should do it.<br /><br />The thing I've found most business books to have in common is that they can over-complicate a restroom break. They're also, generally, not right for small-to-medium sized and start-up businesses. They're impractical, potentially harmful and, in my opinion, should include side-effects warnings like we see on television.<br /><br />REWORK, on the other hand, was written by real business owners who've been there, done that, and lived to tell about it. They know what kind of problems arise, what causes them, and how to prevent or solve them. The authors actually own and manage a profitable, multimillion dollar \\"small\\" business. What's more, they still have time for personal lives - go figure! They break the old rules, write new ones, and prosper as a result. The facts affirm that their approach to running a small business is nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />REWORK is a very easy read. It gets right to the point, much to my delight. The authors present their knowledge of what works, and why, in bite-sized chapters. The content is entertaining as well as informative. Their methods work. Their advice is solid. Their message is clear.<br /><br />If you fail to get this book, you'll almost surely regret it many times over. My advice: buy the book, read it and go to the [...] website to see their principles in action. I did and I'm forever changed.<br /><br />To answer the unasked question, I have NO affiliation whatsoever with the authors or anyone else at 37signals. Only a great deal of, well-deserved, respect.

B001KYJA6K|4.0|As anyone who has previously encountered L'Arpeggiata will already realise, two aspects define this excellent Parisian-based ensemble: firstly, a phenomenally high level of musicianship, and secondly, a penchant for programmes which are anything but middle-of-the-road (including, in previous years, collaborations with Italian folk singers, flamenco guitarists and even the renowned jazz clarinettist Gianluigi Trovesi). The present recording, a quasi Baroque 'jam session' focusing on some of Monteverdi's best-known 'hits', is no exception. The level of singing and playing is superb throughout - Nuria Rial (soprano), Philippe Jaroussky (countertenor) and Doron Sherwin (cornett) deserve particular mention for their outstanding contributions to the ensemble.<br /><br />In many respects, the opulent continuo sound of L'Arpeggiata seems ideally suited to Monteverdi's music, with its marked emphasis on varying, sonorous textures: 'Con che soavit&agrave;' (track 14), for example, is unique amongst the entire monodic repertoire in using three contrasting choirs of stringed instruments (rather than just one continuo part). In addition, the more 'rubato' approach of the vocal soloists in certain tracks is noteworthy: not only does this reflect the views of numerous contemporary musicians and theorists (e.g. Zaconni [1592], Caccini [1601] and Frescobaldi [1615], etc.), but, for the 'Lamento della Ninfa' (track 5), is even requested by Monteverdi himself: 'il pianto di essa [ninfa] qual va cantata a tempo del'affetto dell'animo e non a quello de la mano' (preface, 8th Book of Madrigals, 1638).<br /><br />Overall, however, there can be little doubt that L'Arpeggiata's approach to this music is not for the faint hearted. Some of the liberties are glaring, such as their use of Moorish percussion and their tendency to present 'snippets' of pieces - the 'Lamento della Ninfa' (track 5) lacks its introductory and concluding sections, 'Hor che'l ciel e la terra' (track 11) lacks its 'seconda parte', and the unspecified 'instrumental' tracks (1, 7 and 13) are a random mishmash of sinfonias and dances taken from 'Orfeo' (1607, Prologue and Acts II & V) and 'Il Ballo delle Ingrate' (1608). Other aspects are perhaps less obvious but no less disturbing. Firstly, the use of cornetti in the madrigals is not very plausible, especially where Monteverdi stipulates 'con doi violini' (as is the case for tracks 11 and 15). Even allowing for the close correlation between violin and cornett at this time, there is no reason why Monteverdi's directions should not be interpreted literally here, particularly given that there are many other examples where he does actually leave the choice open to performers, writing an indication such as 'con quattro viole o Tronboni' (see below *1). Secondly, whilst the embellishments are undeniably astonishing at times (most obviously from cornettist Doron Sherwin), one is left wondering whether Monteverdi would really have approved of such extreme decoration - certainly, his contemporaries were near unanimous in their scornful dismissal of such shameless virtuosity (see below *2). Lastly, questions arise concerning some of the choice of speeds (see below *3) and, just occasionally, the pronunciation (see below *4).<br /><br />I suspect that these issues will be of little concern to most: certainly, if judged on the strength of the musicianship alone, it hardly needs saying that this is an outstanding release. Ultimately, then, perhaps there is only one real question posed by this recording - namely, should we aim to present Monteverdi's music (or indeed any classical music) as it was probably originally envisaged, or should we simply make it relevant for today's audience...?

185984054X|3.0|I knew before it arrived that it was a short book. I love Mr. Hitchen's work, and I've read all the reviews.  However, I didn't expect to be able to knock it off in just a couple of hours.<br /><br />  The information within was accurate and clearly presented.  The problem is that there's so little of it!  If this was the first book on the dark side of Mother Teresa I had read, I would entertain doubts about just how bad she was/wasn't.<br /><br />  Luckily, it is the second book on her that I've read.  I HIGHLY reccomend [[ASIN:8188248002 Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict]]<br /><br />  That book is over 400 pages long, with great detail and documentation.  The author is a native of Calcutta.  Sadly, the Hitchens book receives far more than it's share of attention due to the author's 'big name' and the provacative title.
0316067598|3.0|I felt the overall story was one to remember. With trials and perserverance shown throughout this is a moving story. The writing was quite a let down, however, you should not read this book for the writing but instead read it for the great story. It shows what some men in the world must face, as well as touches on the training they went through to become the best. If you would like to be taken into combat from your chair with some of the worlds best soldiers this book will deliver that sense.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I got this book on a whim really.  I just adore Vampire romances and was looking for something else while my other favorite series are being written.      I bought this book about a month ago and kept reading something else, I really did not expect much from it but was I ever surprised!    Right off the bat I was interested in this book, it starts off fast and I soon sucked into it.      Roman is tall dark sexy ... and bored, sad.  See's himself as a horrible person.  One evening he was asked to test a certain new prototype which would save so many human lives from Vamps who dont want to give up a warm live body.  Unfortunately for Roman the prototype is not a great success and he looses a fang!  A fang of all things for a 500 year old vampire, how embarrassing!    He must seek out a dentist, of course there are no undead dentist, who needs a dentist after you die?  Fortunately he found a place that is open 24/7    That is where he meets Shanna and his life changes.  Shanna is such a great character I adored her from the beginning.  She is so like a real person, not prefect (body wise), loves food, and is sad and on the run for her life.  Roman being the gentleman he is lends a hand and is brought to his knees by this charming woman.    I can go on and on but this story is so much fun, I was Laughing out loud so many times, the humor is great in this book, and the passion is definitely alive between these 2 characters.    A must read!
0439023483|5.0|It is a well written book that everyone should read.  It is quite intense and not for the faint at heart.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|This is a film that is very...unique. It's a Film of destiny of multiple people's deaths except one person who watches everyone die 3 or 4 times before she meets her death. this is a movie that can not be portrayed well in words. It just reminds me of water going threw a funnel.
B003405MF6|3.0|I've been a Jeff Beck fan since the Yardbird days. To me he is the best   guitar player alive. I have seen him live many times, and was always impressed.  I was disappointed with this cd. He doesn't  push the envelope on any song, and to me it was just too slow. I will continue  to listen to his other's but this one is just not for me.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|I just bought and watched the blu-ray version of Tombstone yesterday, and it was fantastic. Not only is it one of the best westerns ever made (historians claim Val Kilmer was the most complete embodiment of the real Doc Holliday), the blu-ray was so crisp and beautiful I felt like I was there at the OK Corral when it all went down. What a great screenplay, too! I can quote this movie all day long!<br /><br />A must see, and a great addition to any blu-ray collection.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This film was awesome. It had everything an Oscar caliber film should have; zombies, bullets, explosions, fat guys, Bill Murray, and carnival rides. The plot was top notch and left me on the edge of my seat. However, there are a few things left out of the film that I hope the sequel Zombieland 2 will address:    Missing items -  Boobs  More explosions  The American flag  98mph strikeouts  Boobs  Grilled steak  Burger King  Exploding boobs.    If these egregious omissions are corrected then I think Zombieland 2 will not only sweep the Oscars but sweep our hearts as well.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|Lots of action that look AMAZING in blu-ray!  But don't look for a deep meaningful script.  This is one of those big blow-it-all-up films and does a great job at it.    Some people didn't like it but you have to take it for what it is - a fun summer blockbuster movie!
B00005Q4CS|1.0|If I had the ability to take the intangible concept of this movie and transform it into a human being I would punch it right in the jaw then rob the movie/human hybrid of the $5 of rental money I paid for this film and call the cops to let them know a weird hybrid human was wandering the streets.    I wish there was a word invented just for this film. I'll start, let's say this film is Vondarious. As is \\"this film was beyond bad, it's vondarious!\\" and the other person would say \\"whoa dude, that's pretty bad\\" and the guy would say \\"I know I know, but I had to say it. It's just the movie goes beyond bad it's seriously vondarious.\\"
B001H5X7KC|5.0|One of my all time favorite action/comedy movies! So many quotable lines make this a classic.  Looks AMAZING in blu-ray!    Ben Stiller, Robert Downy Jr., and Jack Black are hilarious but Tom Cruise blows them all away!!!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I just loved Hugh Jackman and Nichol Kidman in this movie, their on screen chemistry was great and the special effects in the war/bombing sequences was realistic,but not over the top. I like the sort of hidden theme of the characters under harsh circumstances being able to rise above their flaws to achieve more than society or their peers believe possible, even if their endings are sort of tragic as in the death of Kipling Flynn. I have to admitt I'm really a sucker for happy endings and the underdog winning and getting the girl, that's why we watch movies right, fantacy.
0393072231|5.0|Lewis tells the story of several individuals who saw the financial crisis coming, and got rich doing so. Their stories are very entertaining. The narrative of their stories drives the book, but the book does a very good job explaining the underlying causes of the crisis that makes it understandable for the lay person. Highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in understanding the financial crisis - which should really be all of us.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|After a steady dose of network news, it's important to receive other perspectives.  Michael Moore doesn't disappoint.  In a world where tea baggers want less government spending, are supportive of the corporate powers that led to our current demise, and claim this will enhance liberty when it reduces the incomes of the middle class; we need more Michael Moores to broaden the knowledge pool.  As the Buddha noted, ignorance is the cause of all suffering and the tea baggers and associates are the devil's handmaiden in spreading more ignorance and, as a consequence, more suffering.  Capitalism: A Love Story is a single perspective of many possible perspectives but an antidote to contemporary news.  Our education systems have failed in developing an in-depth understanding of the function of the economy (what's the Federal Reserve -- part of the Army?).  Any thing that can be done to allow a flow of information that questions the usual babble of talking heads is welcomed.  Power to the people?  First step is people understanding the world they live in and this video offers a bit of relief.
B002VECMAO|3.0|So what do you get when you cross \\"Ishtar\\" with \\"Catch-22\\"?  Perhaps you would get something along the lines of \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\", the first genuine goofball farce that anyone has managed to squeeze out utilizing the generally unfunny Iraq War, Mark II as a backdrop. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is a matter of personal taste.    Ewan McGregor stars as Bob Wilton, a recently cuckolded Michigan newspaper reporter who, desperate to break out of his self-pitying reverie, decides on a whim to become a freelancing Iraq War journalist (circa 2003). As he tarries in Kuwait City, uncertain about how to actually go about getting himself into Iraq (he hadn't quite thought that part through before heading overseas) he comes across a mysterious, intriguing fellow named Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) who \\"happens\\" to be heading that way. Initially playing it coy and denying that he is any kind of spook (in spite of veritably oozing Eau de Black Ops), Cassady does a 360 and opens up to Wilton, spinning him quite a wild narrative.    Before he knows it, the reporter is tagging along with Cassady on his nebulous \\"mission\\", too gob smacked by tales of top-secret U.S. military programs involving the development of \\"psychic warriors\\" who liken themselves to Jedi knights, devoted to honing their mastery of various psychokinetic arts, to realize that he could be heading into the middle of the Iraqi desert with a man who is completely delusional and dangerously unhinged (it's sort of like a Hope and Crosby \\"on the road\\" flick-except with insurgents and IEDs).    The fact that Ewan McGregor was the young Obi-Wan in the Star Wars prequels is not lost on the filmmakers, who provide him with opportunity for (perhaps too much) self-referential spoofing reminiscent of Ryan O'Neal's classic deadpan in \\"What's Up, Doc?\\" (when he responds to Barbara Streisand's \\"Love Story\\" quote, \\"Love means never having to say you're sorry\\" with \\"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard\\"). JeffBridges (hamming it big time up as Cassady's mentor) seems to be doing a nod or two to the Ghost of Lebowski Past; and Clooney's character definitely vibes the CIA operative that he played in \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\\". Speaking of hams, Kevin Spacey is also on hand, playing a weaselly character as only he can.    There is some unevenness in the film's tone, but with a dream cast, who are all obviously having such a great time, it's pretty easy to enjoy the ride (I mean, c'mon-Bridges, Clooney, Spacey, AND a gifted \\"fainting goat\\" who knows how to pick up his cues? It all adds up to black comedy gold, my friend). In fact, the film is kind of a throwback to a certain style of quirky, unfettered, freewheeling satire that pervaded the mid-to-late 60s; totally-blown fare like \\"The Magic Christian\\", \\"Skidoo\\", \\"Candy\\" and \\"The Loved One\\".  The film is directed by Grant Heslove (Clooney's partner in their Smokehouse Pictures production company)  and written by Peter Straughn, who adapted from Jon Ronson's, uh, \\"non-fiction\\" book (all you have to do is tell the truth, and no one will believe you). BTW- There are two songs you will not be able to get out of your head for days: Boston's \\"More Than a Feeling\\", and the theme from Barney the Dinosaur's TV show. You have been warned!

B001OQCV2E|4.0|With all the doom-saying going on about the year 2012, this movie is particularly apropos.  It jumps immediately into action, and it never lets up- there are no dull moments in this movie!  For those who are worried about 2012, this will feed their fear beautifully, for those who are not, it is a good, rousing movie, guaranteed to entertain!  While it may be scary for some younger viewers, it is to be noted that there is no gratuitous sex, bad language is minimal, and appropriate for the scene, and while there is violence, it is not the exaggerated and overplayed bloody gore of human-against-human so common in action flicks these days.  Indeed, this movie tends to give one hope that perhaps we are worth saving, after all!<br />  John Cusack, not notoriously known for his action movies, performs admirably in this one.  The whole cast was really top-notch.  The one who stands out, and actually has one of the smaller roles, is Woody Harrelson.  Utterly believable as the 'doomsday jock', he plays one who really believes what he is saying, to the point of seeing it through to the end.<br />  All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and one which begs the question- will we want to watch it again in 2013?
B002VECMAE|4.0|This is a quirky, oddball comedy with some very interesting layers and connections back to 70's counterculture and secret military black projects. While not a full-blown Hollywood farce or timely put-down comedy which are so popular today, it speaks pretty loudly to those who are familiar with the subject matter. I also happen to like all the major stars involved. Equally as important to me were the Extras with interviews of some of the people on whom the book and film were based.    Yes, Virginia, these things have a definite basis in real people and events.    The characters and events are a mixture of fiction along with true events and real people, with the main characters being composites of some very real people. They touch on some of the stranger (declassified) programs the military has tried in an effort to anticipate the future needs and trends in warfare and military techniques. What is in the movie is a blending of at least two different programs, which may not have had much connection in real life: the First Earth Battalion and the Stargate remote viewing program. (NOT to be confused with the radical environmentalist Earth First group.)    The movie really spoke to me in basic ways because I have connections to some of the material covered. Back in the 80s, I discovered and began to study the First Earth Battalion on which a large part of the movie was based. I have two copies of the original Evolutionary Tactics manual from when it was first offered to the public (through the Whole Earth Catalog folks, I believe). I was quite taken by the concept of the modern Warrior Monk, having cut my teeth on Bruce Lee's work and the original Kung-Fu TV series. I had my own T-shirts and buttons made, and seriously considered myself a member of the larger First Earth Battalion community. This was all way before the internet.    I also have a colleague who studied at seminars (courtesy of the Tarrytown folks) with Jim Channon and his associate Frank Burns (not the MASHBurns). When this colleague and I first realized this unlikely connection between us (I also subscribed to the Tarrytown newsletter), we were struck by the very long odds of this happening in the remote and quite small town in which we live, kind of  like the tattoo revealing scene in the movie. He currently has one of my copies of the book.    I also have all of Joe McMoneagle's books on the remote viewing program and have seen the documentary based on Schnabel's book, so I am aware of that material as well.    If I didn't have these connections with the movie's content, I doubt it would have had as strong an impact, and if you don't know or understand these programs and how they fit into history and the changes in military and related areas, then the movie probably won't mean as much or be as good an experience for you.    On the other hand, maybe it will make you sit up and take notice. Maybe you'll find a new part of your path in this material as well. Amazon has most of the material the movie is based upon......and more.    Channon and others are also still around and going strong. First Earth Battalion - For People and Planet!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|It had action, blood & guts, and not politically correct.  I really enjoyed it.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Having originally seen this series with my husband back when it was first on TV I was thrilled to be able to relive these wonderful memories once again right in my own home.      We both enjoyed Hugh's singing the various songs throughout the series, particularly 47 Ginger Headed Sailors.  Since my husband has now passed on, I was very happy to be able to relive some of our best memories together.    If you want fun & laughter by all means try this.

0061655554|5.0|The book itself is a real page turner. Thoroughly entertaining even if you already knew the outcome of the story, when people say this book sets the benchmark of all Wall Street related books they are not too wide off the mark.<br /><br />Although I disagree with the sympathetic undertone the authors have for the villains - for example by the end was almost as if Ross Johnson was not driven by greed but merely a bumbling clown, a man who did know best how to run a successful business(right at the end when everyone else failed to make RJR work in the post LBO era) but I guess one simply can't go round bashing people who consented their appearance and gave time for your interviews.<br /><br />It is astonishing how exhaustive the authors have researched into the subject and how much information was available to them, even in the minute details such as the decor of the offices, (the comments of the lavish designs of the offices were most amusing, if not infuriating for the mere mortal like me)<br /><br />Overall it was a pleasure to read and an amazing journey right through to the end.

B000929AJQ|5.0|This is one of the best albums from my favorite bands, Nine Inch Nails. Now, nothing can and ever will beat the crowning jewel, \\"The Downward Spiral\\", but this album comes pretty close. From the opening track to the albums ending, the whole album rocks.

1400052173|5.0|Let me start by saying that normally I don't read non-fiction or anything associated with 'educational literature'. I read lots of sci-fi, fantasy, juvenile fiction, etc...However, as I was browsing Amazon a few months back I stumbled upon this book. The only way I can describe my instant fascination for getting my hands on this book was that it called to me. Deborah, Henrietta's daughter, would probably call it a sign from Jesus saying that it was important for me(and the rest of the world) to learn the truth about her mother, and I have to say I probably agree with her. From the moment I read the first chapter I was completely entranced. This is such a wonderfully written book that draws you in from page one. The author did an amazing job of rooting the book in such a beautiful juxtaposition of science and human interest and it really feels like a fictional novel with a nice splash of science...I loved that about it! I honestly cannot say enough great things about this book. It has not only sparked my interest in the author(and future books) but also in learning more about DNA, cells(and everything associated), HeLa and Henrietta(and family...oh the family!). This is a MUST read!
B0038VPB5W|5.0|First, I have to say that I was expecting this departure from BFMV. In an interview, Matt Tuck had stated that Fever would be an album made more for the band itself than for the fans and upon listening to the entire album, I can understand why. Typical BFMV fans will miss the aggressiveness displayed on The Poison and Scream, Aim, Fire, but true BFMV (and true fans of great music, for that matter) will most definitely enjoy this release for its uniqueness. Many of the songs are more personal and possess more of a mainstream feel, but for BFMV this is not a bad thing. If there is one band out there that can mix metal and the mainstream appeal of more catchy hard rock tunes together with superior skill its BFMV. And that is exactly what you will find on their latest album, plenty of catchy and memorable tunes that are equal parts hard rock and metal as compared to previous releases that were 75 percent metal blended with 25 percent hard rock. I would say that this release demonstrates Bullet's musical diversity and shows us that they are not afraid to try something new, and if you are one of those individuals that always expects more of the same on every release from a band, then this is not an album for such closed-mindedness.
0743297334|5.0|Understatement to declare this a classic.  This work is so full of life and reflection!  A great work that must be read in one's lifetime and no review can sustain more than the book provides.    Seems obvious to me that Harry Crosby provided vast amounts of inspiration to the character development as well as others of the lost generation.
B00006BSGZ|5.0|At first, I thought these performances at Covent Garden in black and white would be suitable only for fans of Maria Callas or libraries wanting examples of great opera performances from the 1960s.<br /><br />To my surprise, the performance of Callas and Tito Gobbi, as Tosca and Scarpia, has become my definitive example of how Tosca should be performed.  It's all here:  great singing coupled with realistic, dramatic acting--and all on a dark and brooding stage that almost lets us smell the blood of Cavaradossi's suffering below.  It's a Tosca for the ages!
0393061310|4.0|Fantastic account of the migration of peoples, the historical significance of that migration and the influence of latitudes and longitudes to success of same.  Important to note that many may view this book as somewhat controversial, however, it is in the details and data amassed to create such a compelling and interesting account of the history of societies. Very well done and excellent account of the factors that led to the development of power societies and the isolation that sustained and supported societies we now view as third world.    Amazing the influence of germs and the influence of east west mobility within same climate culture to the success of peoples and societies.  Highly recommend for anyone looking to broaden their intellectual intelligence of world history.

There is nothing different about them. I feel the seller should have noted that in the listing ... although the author and/or publisher is really to blame. I have and will continue to buy from this seller.     ** I made a previous post that I meant for this one, after it posts, I will make corrections **

B000PTYP5C|2.0|This is easily Dream Theater's worst work to date. Most of these songs are boring and uninspired, and mainstream sounding. Not in a good way like Falling Into Infinity, but in a \\"Metallica meets Rush and absolutely overshadows Rush\\" kind of way. The only great on this album was \\"In Presence of Enemies\\", a 23 minute epic which is probably one of their best newer songs. Dream Theater has now completely thrown away their old styles from long ago, and stepped into the territory of mainstream metal. I can only hope their future albums are much better than the creative disaster Systematic Chaos was.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|First up, the movie.  Toy Story is classic Pixar, entertaining for both kids and adults.<br /><br />But on the packaging side this Blu-ray/DVD combo is brilliant.

B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|1492. Vlad II Dracul has gone to war against the Muslim turks who have swept into Transylvania. When he comes back, he finds his wife has thrown herself to her death. Infuriated and now full of resentment towards God, he lashes out against the church, stabs a cross, blood pours out, drinks some of it, and says with great fury: \\"The blood is the life... and it shall be mine!\\" and so begins Francis Ford Coppola's msterpiece that is Bram Stoker's Dracula, not only a great horror flick but also a touching love story.<br /><br />Dracula is an adaptation of Stoker's classic novel. In the movie, Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to complete a Transaction, after R.M. Renfield has gone insane. He meets the mysterious Count Dracula, a very creepy and unusual Vamp. He sells Dracula his requested property in Carfax Abbey, England. A few days later, Dracula arrives- in the form of his old self: Vlad II Dracul. Walking the streets, he comes across Mina, who looks like his wife in the past. Therefore, he tries to make her his bride for once and for all.<br /><br />However though, at the Seward Lunatic Asylum, Renfield has been stirring some trouble, Lucy has been bitten by Dracula, and it is reacted to as a sickness. Van Helsing, a dutch doctor, is called, and they try to help her, coming to the one realization: Dracula must be stopped.<br /><br />This film is an epic masterpiece. It contains a powerhouse performance from Gary Oldman, a great cast, amazing practical effects and it looks and feels like an opera. There is tons of romance and gore, and the love story is beautiful and moving. I haven't read the Stoker book yet but I plan on reading it, though I have read the Deane play. Overall, this Dracula/vampire fan recommends.
0307454541|3.0|This was a pretty good book. Kinda hard to get into, but once you do it is worth it in the end. Overall a pretty good book, but not the best.
B0030BYWKK|2.0|On first listen it sounds a lot like eleven versions of Fleetwood Mac's Rhiannon. On further listens you hear a little bit of King Crimson's Court of the Crimson King and Blue Oyster Cult's Don't Fear the Reaper. The doleful vocals do create an interesting mood but there's so little happening musically that the album becomes all about the vocals. The title track stands out more than the others and makes a lasting impression. Otherwise expect one big sad song.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Just like the movie seen in the theater so great. I only wish they had also included some of the background information as seen on some shows. You get the movie which is great but nothing more.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Since I was a business major in college, I wasn't made to read a lot of the standard classics that most people have already read. I'm finally starting to make up for lost time.<br /><br />I loved this book. I have always loved 19th century literature, mostly because I love the societal rules and manners. (The House of Mirth is one of my all-time favorite books.) However, I was a bit surprised that I could be drawn in so much to a romance where no one even kisses. (Especially because some of the paranormal romances I read are practically pornography.) But I couldn't put this book down and I am now in love with Mr. Darcy like so many other women before me.
B001DDBCV4|1.0|This DVD, even today, is billed as coming with a digital copy.  However, the digital copy on all of these DVDs expired 9/23/09.  I have already tried getting a replacement and it has the same problem.  Amazon needs to correct their text and not list this as containing a digital copy.

B002VKE0XA|3.0|I thought this movie was okay.  I like it because is had some truly scary moments.  Most horror films are garbage and rely on things jumping out at you or gore to scare you.  It's that lack of imagination that makes the horror film genre, these days, super boring. All you see is the same old plots recycled over and over again.  This movie is different.  It is scary without being startling.  It's the things you don't see that are most terrifying.  I thought the ending was particularly well done and very creepy.  The story revolves around a young woman and her boyfriend who live in a nice house.  The girl has had a history of seeing strange \\"paranormal\\" things happen to her since she was a child.  You find out that some sort of \\"entity\\" has been following her from house to house.  Her skeptical boyfriend decides to set up a camera in their room to record any strange happenings in their house.  The film, like the Blair Witch Project, is shown from the first person camera point of view.      The film is by no means perfect though. One of the problems I had with the film was the total stupidity of the characters.  They do things that no normal person would do in that situation.  When faced with an evil entity that clearly wants to harm them, what do they do?  They keep on filming and take their sweet time getting help.  The male character, Micah, is particularly idiotic in the fact that he tries to fix the situation himself.  He never seems to take things very seriously even while reviewing the tapes that show some horrifying things happening.  He hears inhuman growling on voice recordings and never seems too worried about it.  Any normal person would be freaked out beyond belief.  Not realistic at all.

037582913X|5.0|My youngest son loved this book when he was about 5, so I bought it again for my great-grandson and he loves it, too.  It's fun to watch their eyes get bigger and bigger when you turn each page and you can see the relief and joy when the last page comes up.
B00000JNNY|5.0|Though this is an album, considering the familiarity and quality of the songs, this could serve as a \\"best of\\" for anyone looking to get into James. This is one of Chess's--in my opinion, the greatest record label in American history--finest gems. There are songs made famous by James (\\"At Last,\\" \\"Sunday Kind of Love,\\" \\"All I could Do was Cry\\") along with some Dixon-penned blues standards like \\"Spoonful,\\" and \\"I Just Want to Make Love To You.\\" In contrast to the exhiliratingly primal blues of Chess mates Howlin'(aka the greatest bluesman of all-time!) and Muddy, Etta's music is sophisticated and jazzy; thus, one does not have to be a blues diehard to enjoy her!
B000077VR3|4.0|This movie is colorful and fast paced but the music is great and Ewan McGregor can sing very well.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie is perfect for family viewing. A really touching story about a dog's love and loyalty to his master.  It was alittle slow in the beginning, but then the story grabbed all of us and by the end, a couple of us had tears running down our faces and we were reduced to mush!  I love that it's a true story, about a real dog and his master.
1591843162|5.0|Linchpin is an operator's manual for the brain.  In my business life, I tend to worship at the altar of Godin so it came as no surprise to me that I loved it.  I wanted nothing more than to go back to kindergarten to trade my \\"cooperative and obedient\\" title for \\"Little Miss Hellion on Wheels,\\" wondering with every fiber of my being how much that would have changed my existence. Godin does that to you - makes your brain expand so far you'll swear it's going to pop - and then he starts filling the void!  First he lays a firm foundation, then, brick by brick, he takes you to a place where it all comes together.  I found myself questioning, and still am months later, almost every action I take, to see exactly what part my lizard - and he's a big 'un - plays.<br /><br />How many times a day do we think of things, then tell ourselves \\"no\\" for reasons that are attached to remaining comfortable?  \\"I think I'll make a video of our product for our blog - oh, wait, no, I can't do that.  My roots need to be touched up first.\\"  Come on!  Is it really about the roots? We're all worried someone will see us, and think us foolish.  Oh, my goodness, we might fail. Our ego might get bruised. What's worse than that? I always think of Newton.  A body at rest remains at rest.  A body in motion remains in motion.  Right?  How far does a body at rest travel?<br /><br />Not having tried just means we failed. We failed to try.  God gave us great brains, great subconscious abilities, great knowledge and wisdom, and we throw it all away.  In Linchpin, Godin removes the container that holds such shallow concerns - and mine was overflowing. Linchpin basically, removes our garbage cans and asks us to please use what we've been given rather than waste it.<br /><br />As someone who's deeply committed to \\"thrive not survive\\" in the start-up and micro world, I wondered just how Linchpin applies to me and my people. What concrete examples might I give that they can relate to. Then, as I was preparing our newsletter, it hit me.  Purple Cow businesses are never owned by ordinary people and Linchpins never own ordinary businesses.  If you apply the chicken-egg examination, an answer does out.  The Linchpin comes first - then the Purple Cow.<br /><br />Now that I understand it, can I at least pin an \\"L\\" on my chest?<br /><br />If I was forced to remove virtually all of the hundreds of books on my \\"success shelves\\" I can promise you, this book would remain.  I'd like to see educators give serious thought as to how they can incorporate these \\"think for success\\" principles into the curriculum in some real way.  It might mean the difference between maintaining our current standard of living and sliding slowly into an economic abyss that I hope not to see in my lifetime.  As our natural resources dry up, all we'll have to export is what lies between our ears.  Linchpin develops those resources just as surely as a drilling rig is needed to find oil.  I ask you, of those two resources, which would you value most highly?<br /><br />It's easy to review most business related books.  They're good. Some are great.  Few will be remembered for generations the way Hill's books, for example, have been remembered.  I tend to give books cook time.  I leave them alone to be rolled around, mulled over, and mixed with other thoughts in my brain.  Most don't stand the test of time.  Most are not books that demand to be written about long after they've been put back on the shelf - or in this case, half a dozen have been \\"lent\\" and not one has come back.  If you're still with me, all I can say, is read the book then tell everyone else you know to read the book - and don't forget to discuss it with your children.our newsletter, it hit me.

1401207529|5.0|Normally, I tend toward the lighter-hearted comics of the Marvel genre where the government may be idiotic, but not entirely corrupt, so perhaps it's partially because of this drastic change of views that I enjoyed this comic so much.      The origin of Batman, who is not only not invincible, but he's fairly easily injured and doesn't just bounce back.  Similarly, although he's not part of the traditional law-enforcement he works in tandem with Gordon at least in order to bring change to the corrupt system.      Similarly, I'm not generally a fan of the art style that people consider to be more realistic than the traditional comic book but it does complement the writing of Miller in this instance and I don't think a Bagley or a Jim Lee would have done so well to illustrate the story.  This is certainly the best DC book I have ever read (though, as mentioned at the beginning of this review, I am primarily a Marvel fan).      The interviews and such with the artist at the end were entertaining as well if not greatly enlightening.

B002CIY8EM|5.0|For years I've subscribed to the theory that the megalithic structures around the world weren't built be man alone.  People have called me crazy for just as long.  I never knew there were people out there, reputable men and women who felt the same was.  That is, until I happened across Von Daniken's book being praised on a television series.  I couldn't help but read it.  I was so glad I did.    Van Daniken's writing is easy to understand for those of us lacking a PhD in archeology but still well versed in the subject matter.  It was easy to forget that he wrote the book in the 1970's until he started talking about inventions on the horizon for the near future.  He mentions the mass-spectrometer as a current \\"concept\\" being discussed for production.  I thought, \\"Wait, that machine is being used in labs all over the country.\\"  It was then that I remembered when he wrote this book and realized just how dead on he was about certain inventions coming into existence.  He also mentions things essential for longer space flights and prolonged exploration.  Things such as computers the size of books and smaller devices for communication.  It dawned on me that he's talking about cell phones and laptops in an age when computers took up whole buildings and rotary dial was still in use.      He stuck to the topics presented in each chapter, backed-up his ideas with facts and evidence and presented a very convincing argument.  Of course, you have to have an open mind when reading his work but he presents it in such a way that it's hard not to be.  If he was talking about anything other than aliens from outer space he would have the scientific community eating out of the palm of his hand.  I look forward to reading more of his work as well as anything else I can get my hands on about this topic.  I'm glad to know I'm not the only \\"crazy\\" one out there!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|It's a pretty good movie. Vast improvement over Order of the Phoenix. Not my favorite of the series.  Hope they don't screw up the next 2 movies.
1892005034|5.0|I really like this book specifically because it gives you actual tools to become a better \\"nonviolent\\" communicator.<br />It has helped me think before I speak, these are tools I did not have before I read this book.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|But he does, in the sixth installment of the Harry Potter epic. Once you read the seventh and final book, Dumbledore's death becomes clear in the context of his own story: you could say that he was already dead - just on borrowed time (given to him by Snape, the character we all love to hate). Of course, with such detailed and complex stories it's always a challenge to bring them to the screen in a way that makes sense, and especially for HP and the Half-Blood Prince it's essential to have read all the books up to and including this one before you see the film. The backstories, the build-up, the carefully crafted plots and subplots and all of their twists and turns can become muddled and confusing without having read the books first, but the filmmakers have done a good job delivering the story. There are a few changes which don't seem to make a lot of sense; for instance the burning of the Burrow, and an anti-climactic kiss between Ginny and Harry in the Room of Requirement, but overall the story is as exciting on film as it is in the pages. What's really noteworthy about the climax of HBP is that Harry has all along been saying Snape and Draco are the bad guys, and lo and behold it looks as if he was finally right. But is he really? Look for the upcoming film versions of The Deathly Hallows, but read it first! Two or three times!<br /><br />Meredith Kennedy, author of The Red Jacket
B00004ZELJ|5.0|So I bought the 3 recommended package of this Dvd, a night out with the boys and All Access.    This was by far a winner. I looked at set list and I was at first a bit iffy on it because the songs weren't really any of my favs (or not yet at least).    Watching it though. Wow the beginning is dynamic and \\"Thats the way I like it\\" really good me grooving. But 2ndly \\"Hey Mr DJ\\" played and at first I was like yea thats alrite. But like 2nd and 3rd time it just grew on me and it took me to another place. It's very techno dancey and reminded me of 80's disco. Everytime I hear  it now I picture myself in a club back then grooving along and its a great place seriously. Also \\"Just to be close\\" the 3rd number IS AMAZING! BREATETAKING AND MESMERISING!!! A full song in proper acapella arrangment.... omfgosh IT WAS PERFECT! EVERY SINGLE BIT!!! Wished they still did stuff like that on tour now. The solos were really good, Kevin was really hot and Nick ABSOLUTELY BLEW MY MIND WITH \\"I NEED YOU TONIGHT\\", it was the best solo I have seen ever. Then there are all the classics and they were all done similar to the videos which were classic and it great to see live.    Overall I love love love how it's just a complete dvd of just the concert (I love behind the scens and interviews but I love them the most for the music and performing sckill) and I really think they need to release something of their recent work more like this.    IT'S GREAT AND IT REALLY TAKES YOU BACK! Its scary to think this was 12 years ago omfgosh thats soo scary. Nick is like 17 here and like an absolute teenage hearthrob (this is the Nick I fell in love with initially), Kevin is at his hottest with his spiked hair and chizzled body, Howie has his spanish feel which he still definately carries, AJ Is just pure dynamic and I'd say at his peak when he was fit and absolutely rocking that stage, and Brian looks exactly the same as he does now in 2010 which is amazing!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  It has humor, drama and romance rolled into an action-filled Sci-Fi series.  Basically, it's a western that takes place 500 years in our future and follows a group of independent, diverse that serve as the captain and crew of Serenity (a firefly class freighter, hence the series name) through some wonderfully written plots and well delivered lines.  Even those who aren't Sci-Fi fans can enjoy this series.  Joss Whedon really created a following for this series, and the accompanying feature length movie (Serenity); as they are all wonderfully entertaining.  And, if you love good stories, and actors that enhance your entertainment experience, this is a must-have.  Best value on Amazon.
B003954I9C|4.0|Well, I must admit I am a huge Backstreet Boys fan I love all their music it's all pretty much amazing. They have gone through so many stages of music: euro-dance, hip hop, rnb, rock but all have brilliant.  Yes they have had elements where the bad plays a major role in the songs eg guitar solos, guitar leads and stuff (\\"Larger Than life\\") and Never Gone as a whole album had rock influence. But the euro-dance element is their roots and theres always been electronic sound in there.    AJ Mclean's new album drops this electronic sound and goes for real instruments and it sounds amazing. When listening I was constantly enthhralled by the beautiful instrumental element particular the use of brass (trumphets etc). However, tt doesn't feel like a modern day 2010 album, I actually felt like I was going back to the big band ish type era like in regards to the instruments. I love it and I really don't like modern pop so this was soo refreshing and I love it sooo much!!!    Now in regards to lyrics and songs. AJ has always been known as the wild, rebel, raw member of the Backstreet Boys (especially in comparison to the other boys). I really find that this album shows Alexander James Mclean for who he really is. It's a great journey looking into his personal story. It's similar to Nick Carter in his solo album \\"Now Or Never\\", it was extremely rock influenced because that's his true passion.     Let me add, I am not biast in this review because AJ is a Backstreet Boy by the way. I do not like Nick or Brian's solo albums and I think I only got 1 song from Nick's. But AJ's actually has really good songs so yea just to clarify that.     Looking at particular songs, \\"Love Crazy\\" is a bit raunchy but I love how he's just so open in the lyrics and it's got a really nice melody and stuff. \\"Mr. A\\" has a powerful intro and the chorus terms into a real rock song. \\"What If\\" and \\"What I do\\" are about topics that almost anyone can relate to and I love them as well.    Pretty much GREAT ALBUM AJ MCLEAN!!! YOU MADE IT YOUR OWN AND YOU HAVE SHOWN US THE REAL YOU!!! THANK YOUU and seriously buy it :D
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Nathan Fillion (Firefly) has a knack for delivering a performance that is both humorous and dramatic at once.  This series, which hopefully won't be cancelled, is very entertaining and rarely predictable.  Writer (Castle) follows a female detective (Beckett) around to get ideas for new novels and help solve crime in a particularly dashing and endearing manner.  Though appearances can be deceiving, the cast really looks like they have fun doing the show.  The chemistry is definitely there, and the lines are delivered with perfect timing and body language.  If the second season is half as good as the first, this is a great buy.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|I bought the disk. Would not play. Updated (with much pain) something called \\"firmware\\" on my blu-ray player. Still wouldn't play. Took disk back. They didn't want to refund my money for an \\"open\\" disk. Had to start shouting and demanding manager before they gave me my money back.    I have heard horror stories about incompatible disks before, but my blu-ray player is almost new (LG BD270) and I didn't expect that I would have to be fiddling with it every other week to play a new disk that I bought. It's ridiculous, either blu-ray is crap technology, or there are a lot of companies selling blu-ray stuff that is crap. Whichever, I'm very sorry I spent any money on it.
0679759328|5.0|It's the end of the season so the guests at Hotel Du Lac are sparse.  Edith, a romance novel writer, has been shuffled off to Switzerland by well-meaning friends to readjust her priorities to better reflect theirs.  Really, she has become an embarrassment to them and it's easier to just shift malleable Edith off to the continent.  The well-heeled Mrs. Pusey and her daughter, Jennifer, are there to use Edith as an audience and sounding board for their shallow lives, shopping and posturing.  Monica, who really only eats cake, gives her relief and a laugh and the lonely deaf woman, Mme Bonneuil saves her small but precious gift for last.<br /><br />Philip Neville tells her she needs to stop worrying about the rest of the world and just do whatever she feels like doing.<br /><br />It's really just the beginning of feminism, before it turned to fundamentalist overreaction.  Brookner assails the women who consume men with their cult of themselves all the while prospecting for he who will best serve their purposes.  Women who raise altars to themselves and the men who demand that women produce the lives and children they have been lead to expect.<br /><br />But Edith writes, she earns her own money.  She has a lovely little cottage and a garden to escape to with her tea after a day of writing.  She serves her purpose in her small society, to amuse, divert, to relax.
B000026OW3|5.0|I must admit that I give 5-star rating for the value you get for such a low price. Arthur Rubinstein is one of the best, if not the best, performers of Chopin, and getting the entire box set for such a low price is a great bargain. Some reviewers mentioned about some sort of hiss when listening to the CDs. I personally did not hear anything. Anywise, even if you hear something, do not forget it is a remastered copy of old recordings. Not very old, but still.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|I've been watching movies for almost 60 years, and \\"L.A. Confidential\\" is one of the most wildly entertaining films I've ever seen. It was so much fun, I didn't want it to end. (It's anything but a comedy -- but it's fun.)<br /><br />The story borrows elements commonly found in \\"hard-boiled\\" detective fiction: loose dames, prostitution and pornography, homosexuality, police corruption, murdered partners, etc, etc, etc. It is, at least superficially, a broad re-imagining of \\"The Big Sleep\\", with an idealistic (but ambitious and hard-nosed) police officer (roughly) standing in for Sam Spade. Of course, given the nature of such novels, these similarities are to be expected. (There is no murdered chauffeur, however.)<br /><br />The director wanted to stay away from \\"noir\\" tone and clich&eacute;, and he succeeds. Though set in 1953, \\"L.A. Confidential\\" seems modern. The performances -- from actors largely unknown at the time -- are perfect. One could not even imagine better.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a beautiful transfer, well-capturing the varied visual moods of LA and surroundings (as discussed in one of the excellent supplements). Some moments, though, appear to have been badly underexposed (as suggested by gray, rather than black backgrounds). Whether this was intentional is not clear, and it doesn't really detract.<br /><br />Unless you're offended by the violence or subject matter, unreservedly recommended.<br /><br />There is one rather surprising error -- \\"When Worlds Collide\\" was released in 1951, not 1953.
1601251505|5.0|When I first heard of Pathfinder, I had my doubts. Dungeons and Dragons had already gone through the change from 3.0 to 3.5, and I loathed the idea of replacing another set of books. After hearing a few acquaintances mention they preferred Pathfinder to both D&D 3.5 and 4th Edition, I gave it a shot. What I found was awesome. Awesome in a way that truly left me with a sense of awe. Pathfinder, like 3.5 before it, picks up where the previous rule set left off but doesn't completely rewrite the rules. In fact, converting a character from 3.5 to Pathfinder is easier to do than from 3.0 to 3.5! One of my favorite changes is replacing the XP penalty for multiclassing with a reward for taking levels in your favored class. Combine this with the rule each character can choose their own favored class (some even get two!) and you never have to worry about that level of Fighter you took when you really want to be a Rogue or Bard. One spectacular change is a streamlining of the grappling rules: they are understandable now, upon first read, and are not likely to require referencing during game play.<br /><br />The bottom like is if you don't like 4th edition, but are looking for something a little different/better than 3.5, I recommend the Pathfinder RPG to you. Also, if you want characters that seem \\"more powerful\\" than a similar character in 3.5, this is also for you.
0141442468|5.0|This book is simply amazing. It is the first one that I read from Oscar Wilde and I have to admit I was amazed by how good he was in choosing the right words to form sentences. Dorian Gray is an amazing character and I think that it appeals to everyone in a certain way. It is a must-read.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What can one say....but amazing.  Susan Boyle has reminded us all not to give up on our dreams.  She has an incredible gift that combined with her innocence, genuineness and down to earth attitude was inspiring to all of us.  I purchased the cd and played it over and over....cried as I listen to her voice and it's qualities.  I then purchased several more of the cd's and gave them as gifts.    The sales of this album speak for itself...it has become the number 1 international cd sold....enjoy this remarkable woman and her amazing gift~

B002ZG99G8|4.0|Adapted from the short-lived Vertigo comic series, \\"The Losers\\" delivers a solid B-action-movie experience. It's got humor, `splosions, and an over-the-top bad guy played by Jason Patric. A few things holding this film back from true greatness are the over-stylized editing (it feels a bit gimmicky after a while), the fight scenes are fast and frequent but aren't that memorable, the plot seems like it was lifted from an \\"A-Team\\" episode, and there's no big name stars to pick up the slack for the less than original characters that fill the film. Jeffery Dean Morgan is the leader of The Losers, and while he did an excellent job as The Comedian in \\"The Watchmen,\\" I couldn't help but wonder how much more an actor like George Clooney or Russel Crowe would bring to the part.     However, the cast has some major talent with Zoe Saldana (kicking butt and in her underwear no less) and the future Captain America, Chris Evans. I doubted Evans' ability to pull off the part of Marvel Comics' most patriotic superhero, but his performance in \\"The Losers\\" has convinced me otherwise. Overall, \\"The Losers\\" was a fun action film and hopefully they'll come back for another go-round.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|While the line between fans over which is the better version of Blade Runner continues to be drawn, I think most will agree that it was just wrong to be \\"stuck\\" with only the [[ASIN:0790729628 Director's Cut]] of the film. And apparently so did Warner Home Video who finally righted their previous wrong with all new multi-disc sets like this Blade Runner Four-Disc Collector's Edition. Comprised of 4 versions of the cult sci-fi classic (including director Ridley Scott's phenomenal new [[ASIN:B000UD0ESA Final Cut]]) this 4-disc (single-sided) box set promises something for every Blade Runner fan, regardless of preference. Though all three complete archival versions: 1982 U.S. Theatrical Cut, 1982 International Theatrical Cut and 1992 Director's Cut are digitally restored and remastered for enhanced picture and audio, they pale in comparison to the 2007 Final Cut which incorporates New Footage and never before seen Special Effects and boasts 3 filmmaker Commentaries. All 4 versions include introduction by director Ridley Scott and feature English Dolby Surround 5.1 audio plus the following additional audio features: English & French Dolby Surround Stereo audio (Archival Versions on Disc 3) and French Dolby Surround 5.1 audio (Final Cut on Disc 1). Special Features include the outstanding documentary \\"Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner\\" and Enchancement Archive. Having all 4 versions of the film plus the bonus features now in one convenient box set was definitely worth the wait. Highly Recommended!
0061537969|5.0|I really fell in love with this book. It was so funny in places and yet I cried at others. I liked the idea of the dog, Enzo telling the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a good piece of believable fiction...Would buy this book again..

I read the book and thought it to be quite compelling in the stories that was told and the amazing theories about how the universe works in getting us what we want...however i do not agree with jus saying you want something and BAM! it's yours or even believing it's yours because if it turns out that car you wanted was sold to someone else how would you feel? It has some great discussions in it but some has flaws as well but otherwsie i found it quite amusing to read and watch
B000056PP2|5.0|I have only watched this movie or had it playing in the background of my life about sixty times since I bought it.  It is a sweet romantic comedy like the old 30's or 40's classics, with a touch of South American magic realism. Wonderful Brazilian music.  Penelope Cruz is just charming and lovely to watch, her best friend is an unforgettable character, and I may watch the film another sixty times to see her husband sing his songs.  The movies is visually beautiful and just plain fun. While you are on Amazon order the soundtrack for your car because you won't want to leave the music at home!
0321647440|5.0|This book is written like a training course, and to get full value you need to take the time to work through the lessons as given. This is not hard, because the book has a DVD with sample photos and disk images that you use in each lesson. When I worked through each lesson step by step with the photos they give you, I learned a lot - more than when I watched some training videos on the web.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked Avatar.  It's a \\"good\\" movie and the Blu-Ray transfer is absolutely gorgeous, the best looking Blu-Ray by far in my collection.  The screen resolution is so sharp and colorful it will make your eyes bleed.    What I don't get is the Avatar hype.  Like I said, I think Avatar is a \\"good\\" movie with good characters and a good story.  What it is NOT though-is original.  If you've seen Ferngully, Battle for Terra, Dances with wolves, Pocahontas or even (to a lesser extent) Return of the Jedi, the story is basically the same.  It's also pretty predictable.  There's really not a lot that's \\"new\\" here or surprising.  How this fairly by the numbers movie has become such a phenomenon is beyond me.  I enjoyed it sure, but I don't get the massive obsession.  I can think of several much better movies in recent memory (Batman: Dark Knight and Iron Man for instance) that are more worthy of their success.    It's also pretty disappointing that there are no extras on this set, not even so much as a digital download.  Gee guys-thanks.  Movie studios have become so greedy lately it sickens me.  I used to feel better about my purchases, but it's all about bending the consumer over nowadays.  Everyone knows by now there's already a special edition planned to milk us for even more of our hard earned cash.  That's okay, I won't be buying it.  Fool me once....
1416914293|5.0|As a sequel to City of Bones, City of Ashes provides a LOT of action. And, again, I was mesmerized by Clare's writing. I have always said dialogues, for me, is purely what gives continuity to the story. The dialogues in this whole series feel very spontaneous -- it makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you just smile because of cutenesses. But description is the highest point of this book. Although I am not so good at building images in my mind by reading description, I can say Cassandra Clare brought this to happen to me this time.<br /><br />Characters continue the same, strong and well-developed. Then, we get to meet a few new ones. There's also more scenes with Magnus and Luke, who I came to adore while reading. Luke really feels like Clary's father while he shows himself to be [super] careful with her, in a way her real father wouldn't.<br /><br />Also, I wish I had seem more scenes between Alec and Jace. I can't even remember when they really talked like best friends anymore... I mean, a real and long conversation. Nonetheless, Alec seemed stronger this time than in the first book. I even got to like him. Oh, I almost forgot to talk about Simon! Which I can't do if I get excited, though. There are changes in his life, but not in his personality. He continues to be that nice, kind, amazing guy in love with his bestfriend. I think you'll gonna like it. So, read the book.<br /><br />After a long and tough literally war, the ending was at the same time hopeful and heartbreaking. So heartbreaking that I felt so emotionally like [the character] and even shed a few tears. I couldn't help myself but run into City of Glass to sneak a peek! I wish I could continue reading this series right now. Once I can't, I may wait a while to dive into the next one. And probably, after that, I will be anxiously waiting for City of Fallen Angels.
B000UNYK76|5.0|I agree with everyone on here....except the dude that called it boring and saying the crowd was \\"board\\".  Seems this review was a complete contradiction.  But for everyone else, you're right...this video is amazing all around!
B001AQR39O|5.0|I bought this as a way to kill time while deployed and it absolutely does that.  Really good tv show that you can watch again and again with your buddies.  arrived quickly in the mail.  Can't wait to get season 3.
B002Y5FKUE|4.0|I was at the Met in person to watch this opera and the music and singing were tremendous, but I did not care for the production. It reminded me of a Gap commercial come to life. Just as important, at times there were so many people on stage at once it was difficult to keep track of the people singing. Ms. Dessay, Mr. Florez, or Mr. Pertusi could get lost in the crowd with the chorus. Now that the opera is on DVD, the opera comes across much better since the cameras can focus on the applicable people singing.     Reviewers have focused on the storyline. While it is not terribly believable, the reality is that many of the operas out there don't have such great plots either. Does an opera always have to have someone that dies tragically at the end? It's the music and singing that counts. And of course, a good production and set would be good too. The chemistry between Mr. Florez and Ms. Dessay was remarkable. Their respective timbres complement each other so well. Their duets were so delicious that I get easily absorbed into their singing and the sheer beauty of the music. While people will probably focus on Ms. Dessay's sleepwalking aria in Act II, Mr. Florez impressed with his jaw-dropping aria (\\"Ah perchè non posso odiarti\\") where he held the final note for an astounding 10+ seconds...with power. Unbelievable to see that in person - and great to see that again on the DVD.     La Sonnambula deserved a better staging for its sublime music, and despite the problems in the storyline and Ms. Zimmerman's production, this DVD is a worthy buy - if not for the camera work which provided better focus, then buy it for the music and singing.
0393072231|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Michael Lewis.  However, I wasn't sure that even he could make this subject that interesting. I am very happy he made the attempt.  I think he succeeded in making what would usually be a very dry subject and making it fascinating. His book considerably improved my grasp of this side of the financial crisis and entertained me along the way.
0553582038|3.0|Mr. Martin's nickname in high school was Rail Road.  I think those who teased him were somehow foreshadowing the future, using one of the slower forms of transportation to forewarn fans of his writing of the snail-crawl of his penmanship.  Until Rail Road becomes a magnet train I would discourage anyone who has yet to begin reading this series from doing so. Unless you have a super-human memory, you'll be rereading the previous volumes again and again just as a refresher every eight to ten years between each books release.  Winter may be coming, but my children's children should be well prepared by then.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|In initial listening these headphones seem to be as advertised.  Very accurate reproduction of the sound, no artificial emphasis on any part of the frequency range.  They also image quite well.  Due to low impedance, must use the proper amplification source.  Worked well with one headphone amp I have, a Musical Fidelity, but others such as output from a CD player headphone jack and another headphone amp, Antique Sound Labs, did not have sufficient gain to drive these phones.  Obviously also not meant to be driven directly from an MP3 player.  Haven't had a direct comparison with the highly regarded AKG K701's, but from what I could gather from reviews I read on the Web these seemed to be slightly preferred over the 701's.  I do own a pair of Sennheiser 650's, and I found the AKG's to be more accurate across the bandwidth, and overall somewhat more resolving.  A great choice with the discounted price available on Amazon.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I would recommend this CD to everyone regardless of age. She is fabulous.  I bought it just prior to taking my granddaughter to see her in concert, and we listened to it over and over.
B000002LOE|5.0|People are free to disagree, but I think this is R.E.M.'s masterpiece and, more than anything else, it reminds me of the Beach Boys' 1966 tour-de-force 'Pet Sounds'.  It shares many of the same qualities of that magnificent album.  Clear, forceful, emotional vocals.  Buoyant, memorable melodies.  Songwriting that looks within with introspection and occasional weariness, but also celebrates something as simple as a good, sunshiny day surrounded by happy people.  Graceful, string-laced arrangements.  And at least four clear-cut classics: \\"Losing My Religion\\", \\"Near Wild Heaven\\", \\"Half a World Away\\", and \\"Country Feedback\\".  This is a wonderful record, and the crown on R.E.M.'s career thus far.    Many consider 1992's 'Automatic for the People' a stronger album, but even though there were some great songs on that record (\\"Everybody Hurts\\" and \\"Man on the Moon\\"), I found it uneven overall.  THIS is the one.
B001C4AFOY|3.0|The Young Victoria is a nice movie. It's so nice that everybody mostly gets along most of the time.  Then, almost two hours later, it's over.  It's a pretty and pleasantly acted movie. Not that it's boring per se.  There are hints of conflict-- the lightly abusive step-father who wants to use the future queen's power for his own agenda (although it's never clear what his agenda is--maybe he's a real do-gooder), the mother who chooses her man above her daughter, the charming Prime Minister who has a reputation for manipulating women and is always hanging about (and what woman wouldn't want Paul Bettany in period costume always within view?), the odds and ends of royals from here and there who promote their own candidates for husband of the queen-to-be. Oh and there's that truly nasty business when the head of the other political party is rather put-out because the newly crowned monarch won't include any women from his team on her list of ladies-in-waiting.  Zounds! From a feminist perspective, the queen, being a queen, is required to ask her chosen mate for his hand in marriage, instead of the other way around, which is a fun change. But who will she ask?!!!!  Who will it be?!!! Who?!!!!    Well, duh.    The most unexpected nugget the film leaves viewers with is that at one point in time, the Queen after whom the Victorian era, with its prim furnishings and tightly-clenched sphincters was named, was a cute, fun girl who liked to dance and knew a good man when she saw one. She even seemed to like sex, albeit within a monogamous relationship. That really is nice, isn't it?
0446569895|4.0|I loved this book.  Kept me laughing from cover to cover.  I would have given it 5 stars but I heard Ozzy interviewed on Howard Stern and he, Ozzy, didn't seem to know some of the details that are in the book.  Not sure if some of the info is inaccurate or if that's just Ozzy being Ozzy.  Either way it was good entertainment and that is why I bought it.
0812973992|4.0|I wrote the following email to a friend regarding this book, and realized that it could also serve as a fairly detailed all-purpose review on a site like Amazon.  So here it goes ...    I've been meaning to send you a quick message to let you know what I thought of Let the Great World Spin, which I finished a few weeks ago. It's definitely worth a read, but with a number of caveats.     First, I felt like it took quite a while (at least 100 pages) to really get into the book, and even then, the structure of the book (which consists of various interconnecting narratives) results in a rather uneven read. For example, a full chapter in \\"Book Two\\" (albeit only eight short pages in length) is devoted to a character that contributes essentially nothing to the novel; those eight pages are almost like a stand-alone short story (and not a great one at that) that the author felt compelled to include in the novel merely to show off his literary skills (see second criticism below). There are a number of additional characters and/or passages in the book that feel similarly tacked on.     Second, while McCann's prose in some instances blew me away with its lyricism / insight / beauty (like: WOW! I would reread passages and just be stunned), at other times, I felt that the writing was just plain pretentious -- like a Harvard English major straining to write a novel that would be taken seriously as literature. I recognize that the line between these two things is not necessarily that well defined (and certainly highly subjective), but at various points in the novel, *whole pages* worth of prose would just get beneath my skin, and I can not recall having a similar reaction to any other novel I have read in the past 10 or so years.     Third, while the novel's \\"payoff\\" (or takeaway or theme or message or whatever) is pretty intellectually compelling (it's really a reflection on 9/11, which the author manages to achieve without ever mentioning 9/11, even after the novel transitions tothe present in the final \\"Book\\"), at the same time, I also felt like the story was simply Crash taking place in NYC in the 1970s, told in a more highbrow literary vein (see my second point) with a *slightly* shifted (and slightly more subtle) thematic focus. And while I was, I admit, a fan of the movie Crash, I also thought it was ludicrously overrated and that most criticisms of it were well deserved; I ultimately feel the same way about Let the Great World Spin.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Zombieland was extremely entertaining. Don't wanna give out any spoilers but there were very funny moments such as Talahasee's obsession through out the movie. Overall I laughed quite a bit, well worth the price of admission and well worth purchasing to watch again as it has replay value.
B000002U9W|5.0|There is nothing to say about Pink Floyd. They are simply amazing. This album is one of the best albums of all time. Put on the headphones, go to your own lil world and sit back.[[ASIN:B0000ASX9S Shakespeare Ugly Stick Kit]]
B001OQCV6A|4.0|When I first saw trailers , I originally thought Robert Downey Jr was miscast. I had listened to film critics who said they didn't like it , saying it wasn't true to 'Sherlock Holmes' character.<br />I wont listen to critics any longer after this.<br />I rented it out of curiosity because I like Sherlock Holmes films. In fact, I have the entire Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes films as well as several others like Murder be Decree and the 7 Per Cent Solution. So I decided to give this movie a chance despite what others had said..and I thoroughly enjoyed it..much to my surprise..<br />I thought this was a really fantastic film, far surpassing my expectations.<br />This is not the best Sherlock Holmes film ever made, but this film has a great deal of action all the way through, a very thought out story where you need to pay attention so you can find clues to the mystery. The cinematography was fantastic. This to me captured the turn of the century feel as well as a 1970's Sherlock Holmes film. Robert Downey Jr might not be the best ever Holmes, but he was certainly credible in his role. He is a fantastic actor. Watch for the scene with the flies , this I believe came from a Basil Rathbone Holmes movie. And the climax atop an unfinished bridge is breathtaking, not just for the action but the scenery as well.<br />To those like me who prefer Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes , Robert Downey Jr. did a tremendous job with the character. He had quite the shoes to fill not just the shoes of Rathbone and Brett but Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee & Christopher Plummer who also played Sherlock Holmes at one point or another.<br />The interaction between Holmes and Watson was phenomenal. Jude Law as Watson was also well done, my only gripe was he was more a 'tough guy' in this picture than how he's been portrayed in previous films.<br />This was a little bit revisionist but the movie didn't resort to lousy, campy unfunny one liners. The humor came at appropriate times & did not interfere with the pacing of this movie. Holmes doing crazy experiments such as hanging himself on the ceiling might have been a little too far fetched, tongue in cheek but still fit well with this picture.<br />This was a magical picture to me. I will not give away anything to spoil it, other than I think it will take repeated viewings to absorb it all. Very highly recommended despite what some critics might say & if it isn't true to the books of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Whether or not based on the books, as a film in itself I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />Even if you prefer other actors' rendition of Sherlock Holmes I would give this a try because you might be pleasantly surprised with how well Robert Downey plays Sherlock Holmes as well as Jude Law playing Doctor Watson who in this film gets a slight origin mentioned as to what makes him more of a 'tough' guy in this picture.<br />There also was implication that a sequel could be made, and after seeing this 2 times now, I would be all for a sequel to this movie..if they can keep the formula more or less the same.<br />Worth seeing, and to some worth owning..not interfere with the pacing of this movie.

B0034JKZ86|5.0|We love that Disney finally created an African-American princess.  I think the voodoo character and scene in the movie is so unnecessary and is NOT kid friendly.  I don't understand why Disney feels it necessary to put such evil in a kids movie.  I love the Tiana and Nevin characters.  I bought this DVD so that I could fast forward the evil voodoo scenes.
0525421580|5.0|I picked this up on a whim and I sure am glad I did!  This was a great read and took me back to my high school days and the feelings that all kids experience as they try to figure out who they are.  This book had some great and touching moments and was written in such a way that you really feel like you're there.  I highly recommend it for all ages...but especially for teens and parents of teens (who might forget that it's a hard thing to grow up).  Fabulous!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|Lets face it. It's just like everything else we deal with in life, the good and the bad, the dark and the light, the Right vs. the Left, the truth and the lies, when everybody is right, and everyone is wrong, It's just the same old politics we've dealt with all along.  This movie takes the worst of a great thing and has it defeating the things that kept them from growing and surviving as a people.  Through out all of history the discovered are the conquered, it has always been that way and so it will remain.  Lets just hope that here on earth we are not discovered any time soon, lest we become the Avatar, and the mysterious interconnected thinking forest is actually our power grid, all communication as we know it would shut down.  In all seriousness though, what being would attact a gun ship with a bow and arrow?  That will surely get you a feather in your head dress. While I'm thinking about it I recall just last week when I had a visit to the local stock yards and watched as they processed beef, the guy that was pulling the trigger on the MOO-DEER was also 'Thanking Them' and telling them they would now become part of mankind.  He didn't bother telling them about also being stuffed into a dog food can or streached across a sofa to forever support someones big fat ass in the name of mankind!  The movies story line could have been better.  Instead of staging a scene where a superior force is moving in to fulfil it's needs with tactics that were used at places with names such as Ma-Lae, Waco, and Northern Iraq. Marines are our Son's, Brother's, Daughter's, Sister's, and more.  They will stop at nothing to finish thier mission.  Was it the Marines, or maybe they where just a repersentation of the U.S. Calvary when our country was moving westward, growing up<br />to become the good old U.S.A.  This film could have been made using a loose adaptation of how the mean old U.S.A. stole Alaska from the poor misguided cashstrapped Russians.  The U.S. did pay a modest price for Alaska, VERY modest.  Who are these people that made this film, some Communist<br />Marxist lovers that hate this great land that we negotaited for with the Native Americans?  You know, the same people that had this great land for generations and the only natural resorce they found was the Buffalo.  Don't you know when a buffalo was brought down, I'm sure it was thanked, but then it had to be drug or carried back to the T.P. because the Native Americans never invented the wheel.  Just like in the film, the Avatar where shown dragging their sick and injured away on wheeless skids.  It was something to see when the forrest attacked the marines.  I was amazed at the tricks one could train those wild creatures to pull off, must have started when they where pups, something in their dog food must be extra special for them to act in this way.  Could be that mankind stuff that was packed into every can before it was brought from EARTH.  Probably the United States of America, because isn't that what is really being attacked here anyway?<br />My Wife, 19 and 23 yr old Daughters and I watched it in Blu-Ray a couple of nights ago.  I thought the special effect and sound where of stand out quality, my wife hated the movie almost as much as I did, and she is a liberal.<br />Both my Daughters loved this flick and I know they would like to see it over and over, but my wife wisely loaned it to her Mom (with my blessing) and I hope I never see it again... ever!<br />God Bless the U.S.A.laska, VERY modest.

B0036EH40Q|5.0|In my opinion, the Blu-ray format simply isn't for all movies or shows.  For instance I don't see the sense in watching say, \\"Breakfast Club\\" in Blu-ray.  That being said, this is definitely one of those movies that I was happy to see finally released on Blu-ray.  I also feel the need to say that of the two movies that were released \\"Coincidentally\\" within the same time-frame this one is without doubt the better of the two, the other being the movie titled \\"Wyatt Earp\\" starring Kevin Costner.  I suppose I just have this thing about Kevin Costner being in a movie, except I thought \\"Dances With Wolves\\" was a great movie, yet even then I find myself imagining different actors in that role, and well I'd probably cast Kurt Russell in that movie as well.<br /><br />THE DVD and BLU-RAY FORMAT:<br /><br />Sorry, getting back with Tombstone, from a Blu-ray standpoint I enjoyed the crisp detail and in contrast to another review felt that the Audio sounded great.  I was, however, disappointed that the release did not include the Director's Cut and wonder why Blu-ray releases continue to make this mistake with excluding other versions since I as remember when the format had first debuted that extra content such as this was one of the great features of having so much more room.<br /><br />THE MOVIE and CASTING:<br /><br />As far as the movie and the story, this well so well cast that I was surprised that it didn't win just a ton of awards.  Kurt Russel as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday was brilliant.  This along with a cameo appearance of Charlton Heston and the remaining cast of Sam Elliot, Dana Delany, and Bill Paxton just to name a few recreated a legend that will forever mark what the Western Frontier and the rewards and sacrifices that came along with it was all about;  A truly excellent film.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />A lot of people think my best friend looks exactly like Kevin Costner and I suppose I see the likeness.  I also wonder what \\"Dances with Wolves\\" would have been like with say Christian Slater, James Spader, Edward James Olmos, or even Edward Norton?<br /><br />I give Tombstone the Blu-ray version a 9 out of 10 - 1 point for not having the Director's Cut included.<br />However Tombstone the Movie a 10 out of 10!tian Slater, James Spader, Edward James Olmos, or even Edward Norton?

0679809015|5.0|I've been trying to get my 16 month old son to learn more words, and this has been the book to do that.   The page on the left asks a question about which animal makes a particular sound.  The page on the right has a flap and underneath the flap is the answer.  My 16 month old loves to open the flaps.  I've found this book to be really helpful in teaching him more vocabulary.  He lifts the flap and I repeat the name of the animal several times.   If you want your toddler to learn more words, this is a good book for it.  Story books don't have the same effect.

B0039208QM|5.0|I first saw Batman Returns in 1992 when it was released in theaters. I was 10 years old then, and to this day it remains my favorite movie of all time. Sure, it has all the elements of a good movie - action, romance, comedy - but I also think it's a really good psychological study as well. I like seeing how a person transforms from one thing to another and am fascinated by the concept of dual personalities. That's what a lot of movies today are missing - character development and insight into the motivations behind their actions. It will really get you thinking about the thin line that separates mental instability from sheer brilliance (for both heroes and villains alike). I have never followed the comics, so I can't compare these characterizations to how they're traditionally \\"supposed\\" to be, but at this point I have a difficult time picturing Catwoman, The Penguin, and even Batman himself, any other way. Perfect casting all around.<br /><br />Having gone through a VHS copy years ago and acquiring multiple DVD editions since, I was thrilled to see that Batman Returns has finally been released on Blu-Ray, separate from last year's franchise box set which I didn't really want to shell out the money for. The generous special features included here are identical to the most recent 2-disc DVD special edition that includes a 1992 behind the scenes featurette along with some other Batman related documentaries. You'll also find the official music video for \\"Face To Face,\\" the lusciously hypnotic Siouxsie and the Banshees song that plays in the background during Shreck's Max-squerade Ball scene. All this is contained on just one disc, which is nice. The picture is crystal clear and much more fluid than the DVD transfer; sometimes I can't tell the difference but this was just amazing and very refreshing. Unfortunately, beyond the improved sound and sharper picture, which may or may not be all that noticeable depending on your TV set, I `ll have to admit there isn't much else for incentives *if* you already have the special edition DVD. A cast retrospective would have been great to see on this new Blu-Ray version, but alas, no such luck. As I said, it's my favorite movie, so I wanted it to be as high-def and up-to-date as possible, and most definitely consider the Blu-Ray release to be worthy of 5 stars in and of itself. But if you're a more casual fan then there's probably no need to buy virtually the same thing twice. Otherwise, get it now!centives *if* you already have the special edition DVD.

Measurements are in dual units, chapters on trapping, fur/hide treatment, edible plants, hunting, fishing, etc were just far more complete than the Mors book.  The plant section included color images which I feel make identification far easier.  The Mors book was horribly edited, disjunct and unmemorable.  The Mors book does seem to cover more extended living topics like basket weaving.    Some of the content feels rehashed from other sources, like from a boy scout handbook.  Coverage of rope making feels to me like it was ripped right out of the Mors book.  The map usage section is just abysmal.  There is not one aspect of actual orienteering that is covered.  Fire is such a critical part of survival, I would like to have seen some more depth to the coverage of the topic.  These are the reasons I knock off a star.    But in closing, it does deliver so much useful information at an extremely reasonable price, I would definitely recommend it as a book to read and to keep as a reference in whatever preparedness kit you may have.
B000RJO578|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were great in this, just like Shawn of the Dead. Simon is a cop who is re-assinged to a small place where the crim rate is very low, yet the accident rate is so high. There are great and funny moments in this film. The main shootout at the end of the film was amazing. Nothing like an old lady using a machine gun.

B001GCUO5W|4.0|I have to admit that I love the DiCaprio/Scorsese combo.  Shutter Island is a great film, with a predictable \\"twist\\".  However it was the circumstances of the \\"twist\\" that blew me away.  Scorsese's genius is that he isn't trying to hide the truth from you.  All the clues are there.  Regardless of how predictable I found the film, it didn't at all take away from the enjoyment.  DiCaprio gives a wonderful performance as US Marshall Teddy Daniels.  While Daniels is suppose to be there investigating an escape, he has his own agenda on Shutter Island.
0199233381|5.0|For a book of such brevity, this is a remarkably full accounting of the Ancient Greeks. As Cartledge observes, ancient mainland and Aegean Greece included over 700 individual city-states (poleis), as well as hundreds more Greek colonies and trading-posts along the rims of the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Thus it is salutary that Cartledge chooses to approach ancient Greek history through the technique of considering 11 representative Greek city-states in 11 successive chapters, and an Epilogue. This is appropriate, as the polis remained the fundamental unit in over two millennia of Greek History, even when under the later hegemony of such Great Powers as Macedon, Rome, and Constantinople.  The poleis Cartledge chooses are as follows: Prehistory: Cnossos (on Crete) and Mycenae; Dark and Archaic Ages (ca. 1000-500 B.C.):Argos, Miletus, Massalia, and Sparta; Classical Period (500-330 B.C.): Athens, Syracuse (on Sicily), and Thebes; Hellenistic Age (ca. 330-31 B.C.): Alexandria; and, finally, Byzantion (later Constantinople and Istanbul). As Cartledge makes clear, this list of necessity leaves out many other worthy contenders such as a Black Sea settlement (though Byzantion is on the narrows of the Bosporus, which lead into the Black Sea); the significant North African city of Cyrene, on the eastern Libyan coast (though Alexandria is later placed some 400 miles east, on the coast of the western Nile Delta); or a city of Magna Graecia (mainland Italy), maybe Cumae, on the Bay of Naples.  Through the cities Cartledge DOES choose, he is well-able to narrate the history of Ancient Greece, including the Minoans on Crete; the Mycenaeans on Crete (after 1400 B.C.) and the mainland (Mycenae, Argos) who used Linear B, (deciphered as the earliest known written form [ca. 1400 B.C.] of Greek by Michael Ventris in 1952) mainly for taxation and inventory purposes; colonization; the rise of tyrants; the Greco-Persian Wars (ca. 500-479 B.C.); the Peloponnesian War between Sparta and Athens (431-404 B.C.); the ascendancy of Thebes (early 4th c. B.C.); the rise of Macedon (ca. 338 B.C.); and the coming of Rome (2nd c. B.C.).  Professor Cartledge's mind is clearly brimming with a lifetime's learning, and he ranges with alacrity across this sweep of time and geography. This is the first book by Cartledge that I have read, and I quite enjoyed it. He has an engaging style, often leavened by humor. As the book was published in 2009, Cartledge is able to incorporate the most recent scholarship, often archaeological. We learn that a Linear B tablet was found at Thebes with a word that looks like \\"Lakedaemon,\\" the southwestern region of the Peloponnese which includes Sparta, and is mentioned frequently in Homer as the home of Menelaos, King of Sparta, original husband of Helen (later \\"of Troy\\"). No Mycenaean palace (as would have housed King Menelaos), has yet been found in Lakonia, but recent surface finds of Linear B fragments in the vicinity of Sparta offer tantalizing prospects.  Also, in Athens, the recent tunneling for the new subway uncovered mass graves, probably from the plague that swept Athens in 430-29 B.C. and took the life of Pericles (builder [and rebuilder] of the sacred structures on the Athenian acropolis) and countless other Athenians.  In his narrative, Cartledge notes some interesting facts. He states that Sparta was by far the largest Greek polis in terms of land area, followed by Syracuse, and Athens/Attica in third place. He mentions that at the height of its \\"Athenian Empire,\\" (ca. 440 B.C.) Athens was collecting 1,000 talents a year from its \\"allied\\" poleis, an huge sum not to be equaled by a Greek power until Alexander the Graet pillaged the seemingly limitless wealth of the Persian Empire after 331 B.C.   Cartledge also makes the important point that, to the \\"Old Greeks\\" in the eastern homelands, the colonies of Sicily, Italy, and the western Mediterranean, represented the \\"Golden West:\\" a region of rich agricultural lands andfavorable settlement sites. Indeed Sicily, known as a breadbasket and land of sumptuous local coinages, exerted a powerful pull on the Athenians' imagination; and fantasies of riches led to the Athenians' ill-fated Sicilian naval expedition in 415-13 B.C. This horrific defeat at Syracuse planted the seeds for the Athenians' final defeat by Sparta in 404 B.C.  Cartledge brings the narrative full-circle by ending with Byzantion. Originally founded as a colony of Megara (on the eastern coast of the Isthmus of Corinth) in 688 or 657 B.C, Byzantion controlled the trade-routes to the rich grainlands of today's Ukraine and south Russia. Constantine moved his main capital from Rome to Byzantion (renamed \\"Constantinople\\") in 324-30 A.D. Here Latin was the official language until the reign of Justinian the Great (527-65 A.D.). Later, as the capital of the \\"Byzantine Empire,\\" (through 1453 A.D.) the inhabitants spoke Greek, but continued to call themselves \\"Romans.\\"   To me, Cartledge's book is a compact but rewarding read. However, as some other reviewers note, it may not be the ideal introduction to someone who knows very little about Ancient Greece. If you paid attention in a decent college survey of Ancient Greek History, much of the book should be familiar. But if there are too many names and places coming too fast, I would suggest reading Cartledge's \\"Ancient Greece: A History in Eleven Cities\\" along with H.D.F. Kitto's \\"The Greeks\\" (1951), or Moses Finley's \\"The Ancient Greeks\\" (1964), both short treatments that will further flesh out the details. The maps in Cartledge's book are quite good, and there in a helpful Glossary, Who's Who, and suggestions for further reading. All in all, a very good book.

B003405MF6|3.0|I have to say that I approached this CD with trepidation. Usually, pop musicians aspiring to classical settings results in a pretentious schlocky mess, and I was worried that this CD would fall into that camp. And to be sure there are places where the orchestrations are syrupy and overly lush background music. In any other hands, guitar played over these orchestrations would have been just awful. But Jeff Beck plays with such intense expressiveness and superlative technique that he makes it work most of the time. I was particularly suspicious of Nessun Dorma---I just couldn't imagine making that work; but Beck pulls it off with flying colors. His playing is extremely vocal, but fortunately he doesn't try for classical purity of tone. In the more emotional parts, he lets just the right amount of distortion into his tone, letting it be unabashedly electric, and it actually works. It passed the goosebump test.  Like some of the other reviewers here, I miss the gut-wrenching blowtorch playing that is so evident on the Ronny Scott DVD, but there is so much beauty here that I don't really mind. Well worth repeated listenings.

B001GCUMFY|4.0|This is an incredibly stimulating book by a leading physicist reflecting on the current status of fundamental physics. It is not just about science per se, but also the sociology and even the philosophy of science, seen from the point of view of a practicing physicist who has worked with string theory and who now thinks that it likely is a dead end in terms of \\"the ultimate theory of everything.\\" Smolin gives a fascinating overview of the recent history of physics, arriving at the conclusion that this is the first generation of physicists in about a couple of centuries who have not managed to produce a major theoretical breakthrough. String theory for Smolin is a brilliant idea that had the unfortunate consequence of taking over the entire field, which resulted in hiring and granting policies that have systematically discouraged other approaches (such as loop quantum gravity, on which Smolin also has worked). The author diagnoses the problem in terms of both philosophy and sociology of science. Philosophically, the current dominant figures of fundamental physics see science itself very differently from the physicists of the generation of Einstein, and this change of vision is not necessarily for the better. Sociologically, we are treated to an in-depth criticism of how granting agencies and departmental hiring practices work, something that will not surprise anyone who has actually been in academia, but that is good to appreciate on the part of the general public. Smolin ends up making some bold suggestions on both how to improve the culture of science and how to get physics unstuck from its current predicament. Even if you are sympathetic to string theory, this is a book well worth reading in order to gain a better perspective on how we do physical science today (despite the fact that the middle part gets quite technical and may not be easy to digest for everyone).
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I saw Avatar in 3D twice--once in an all digital theater, and once in Imax 3D.    Still-----while I enjoyed the 3D experience, the DVD is well worth buying. Visually rich and the colors are sparkling.  I love watching movies in 2D, because frankly, they usually have more color, due to not having to wear those theater glasses that mute everything a bit.  The audio is great, too.  There is no need to review the story or the performances---this is one movie where you either like it or you don't, and most people have already seen it in theaters anyway, so the question boils down to whether or not you would like to have your own personal blu-ray copy to watch on your own television.    I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with the quality of the DVD.  It is well worth buying.
0060557818|3.0|I really tried with this book because of all of the positive reviews, but I just didn't get sucked in. I suppose it was because the first 150 pages I just could not connect with the characters in the book    Otherwise it was well written, and it was a refreshing style. It just didn't have the goods to get me interested.
048623231X|5.0|Although just a man, the prolific career of Gustove Dore really has some divine inspiration. Perhaps that's one reason the church needed him so much - perhaps something really did reach out and whisper his name and someone listened. (Personally I hope that thing was Cthulhu and the dreams were bad, but that's just me)<br /><br />As far as this book goes, it is one of the easiest to gain entry into a very exciting world. I like the way the rendering are set to tell the story, too, allowing the reader to walk through some frightening gates and look into some of the terrible things that are described in a language that sometimes does seem heavy (Personal opinion and I don't mean offense by it).<br /><br />When I look at this, it reminds me of the journey that I took as a young adult while learning about all those names and faces that I didn't know. It also reminds me of everything from people with their bodies buried in the ground to one poor soul writhing as a half spider/half woman appeared on the ground. Dore is that kind of influence and I'm glad that someone granted me entry into this world because, if they hadn't, I would have missed out on so much. So, brielf, I have to say that this is well worth the price of admission and it is well worth obtaining so you can look at the detail and marvel at the tools being utilized.<br /><br />also, look into the other books. The bible, the mad; Dore was inspired by everything. And that is inspiring, to say the least.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This storyline is much like what the government is really doing, also I wouldn't doubt technology like this actually exist because they have similar things. Being someone who meditates and has Outer body experiences I can tell that much of this movie is actually possible. Consciousness has a major roll in everything. This place the Avatars live in could have been where we are now if we took our gifts and used them to there potential. This truly is an amazing movie. And I don't even watch tv anymore at all because everything is totally irrelevant. But I'd spend countless dollars on the best sound system and tv just to watch this one movie. AMAZING!!!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood pulls double duty as director and actor here, starring as Walt Kowalski, a mean, cranky old racist who has a change of heart in \\"Gran Torino\\".  The journey Walt takes is just one of several making up the movie though.       It starts with the funeral of Walt's beloved wife, who we never see but gather was somewhat of a kinder soul than Walt, and probably a positive influence as far as keeping his nastier character traits at bay.  In the days following the funeral we see Walt as alone and bitter, estranged from the rest of his family and seemingly unable to make emotional connections.  One of the things making him so bitter is that his neighborhood is becoming increasingly Asian in character.  North America is changing, and places that were once almost exclusively white are now more multi-racial or in some case dominated by one particular ethnic group.  This neighborhood has an increasing number of Hmong (a Southeast Asian ethnic group), and it's safe to say that Walt hasn't been overjoyed to see their numbers increasing over the years.  At the start of the movie, he's a racist, not just 'old and set in his ways', not just 'narrow-minded', but outright racist.  The fact that the movie doesn't try to sugarcoat it makes the character's transformation much more powerful.          There are two main interpersonal 'pulls' in the movie - one is Walt's being pulled against his will into the fabric of the neighborhood, the other is a Hmong kid of around 15 (I estimate), Thao (Bee Vang) - Walt's next door neighbor - being pulled against his will into a Hmong-dominated street gang.   He's cousin to one of the heads of the gang, and therefore, as the gang expands further and further from their traditional stomping grounds and into the suburbs, Thao gets invited to join.  In classic gang style, it's an offer he can't refuse.  So little by little he's getting sucked into this lifestyle that he very much wants to avoid, but appears powerless to.  His initiation feat into the gang is to steal his neighbor Walt's classic Gran Torino car.  When he's caught in the act and the other members flee, his family decides his punishment is to 'help out' Walt with yard work, household chores, etc. for the next little while, as atonement.  Walt isn't interested and refuses the deal, but Thao is pushed to try and make ammends anyway.  Not long after, an incident in the neighborhood involving the gang occurs, and Walt becomes the neighborhood hero by running a couple of gang members off.  To Walt's horror, this seems to spur the Hmong community in the neighborhood to 'adopt' him, arriving with gifts and baskets and food, always greeting him warmly, seemingly oblivious to the fact that Walt doesn't like them very much.  Of course, despite his hostility towards Asians, he's never really known one outside of his experiences in the Korean War, where they were on opposite sides (he seems to have plenty of recollections of Koreans as the enemy, but few of the South Koreans as his side's allies).  As he's unwillingly drawn into the community, his feelings toward his Hmong neighbors slowly begin to change...       This may sound cliched or contrived, but absolutely nothing in the movie comes off that way.  Every characterization and interaction - good or bad - feels very genuine.  During this time we see Walt trying and failing to re-establish some kind of connection with his biological family; we also see him being very shocked with himself that he's becoming so close to his 'new' family, particularly Thao and his older sister Sue (Ahney Her), to both of whom he seems to be filling some kind of uncle of even fatherly role.  Meanwhile though, the other pull is still going - the gang's determination to recruit Thao, seemingly motivated primarily by the fact that they're offended by the idea of anyone turning them down.  Thao is increasingly determined not to go that way, but that just seems to make the gang more insistent.  Gran Torino gives a really good picture of the hard spot someone like Thao is in when he's targeted for recruitment like this by a gang that might do anything at all if he doesn't go along with them.  It's a predicament his family sees, and that Walt comes to recognize as well.       The movie becomes extremely intense in its end stages, building up to a tremendously powerful finale.  What's more unexpected is all the humor and, for lack of a better word, 'warmth' that starts coming in about a third of the way through.  These elements don't clash with the tension, but provide a counterpoint.  And as we see in the movie, things can turn from very 'happy' to very, very grim on a dime.       An ability to juggle seemingly disparate tones, and universally excellent performances, help make Gran Torino a great movie on all levels.  For a skillful blend of drama, tenderness and vicious suspense, you can't go better than this one.
B00004BZ16|5.0|UPDATE:  A year later and Sandinsta gets just as many spins as London Calling.  The obscure dubs and edits have even grown on me.  This is in fact a magnificent (7) sprawling 3 lp set on 2 CDs.  It isn't London Calling, it's something else but it is great stuff.<br /><br />Original Review<br /><br />I picked this up last week and it hasn't left my CD player or Ipod since purchase.<br /><br />Q: Is this as brilliant as LONDON CALLING?<br />A: Not quite. How can anything be as brilliant as LONDON CALLING?  That's the kind of music that comes around once in a decade or two.  It's the Clash's Sistine Chapel.<br />Q  Is it at all like LONDON CALLING?<br />A: Well...Not really.  Maybe in a few tunes of the sprawling 36 tune set.<br />Q: Is there a single great album among the 36 tune set as some reviewers have stated?<br />A: I think that's a little exaggerated myself.  I can see how some would not like some of the songs that are certainly The Clash doing a little stretching (in my book that is the mark of a true artist).<br />Q: Is this The Clash's equivalent of The Rolling Stones masterwork EXILE ON MAIN STREET?<br />A: Yes. Recall that the Rolling Stones really stretched themselves and dabbled in lots of song forms on EXILE...<br /><br />Personally, I like this entire set, including all of the short speaking interludes.  The release is certainly heavy on the reggae style and especially far out dubbing.  If you \\"don't like reggae\\" as the 10cc tune states then you should leave this one alone.  I think that it's interesting to listen to tunes like UP IN HEAVEN and hear the source of a prime influence on on The Cure.  This is especially true of the Mick Jones tracks, one can hear Jones's influence on The Cure all over the tunes that Jones wrote.<br /><br />I'll write more later, I must get to work.  In the meantime, if you love The Clash and are open to listening to them make some music that stretches well beyond pogo-dance-able music then SANDINISTA! is a great way to spend $20.00.

B000022TSY|2.0|Two hippies, Wyatt and Billy, drive cross country on their motorcycles in order to blow a lot of money at Mardi gras.  In the process they meet a slew of strange yet vital characters in their eventual understanding of their own existence.<br /><br />The problem I have with `Easy Rider' is that it doesn't go anywhere for nearly half the film.  I usually adore this freelance style of filmmaking, but `Easy Rider' does not sit well with me at all.  In fact, the film is one gigantic fail for me until Jack Nicholson enters the story.  His performance is outstanding, but I'll get to that in a minute.  The film seems to just hang there, serving as a longwinded music video for some great classic rock tunes and some stunning (yet unrefined) cinematography.  The `profound' statement that this film is trying to make gets lost along the way, only unveiling itself in small doses (like when Nicholson gets preachy in a sleeping bag).<br /><br />`Easy Rider' is sort of boring.<br /><br />Dennis Hooper's direction can be distracting at times (the way he splices his scenes together is creative yet unnecessary) and the tonal shift of his film towards the end is rather questionable.  In fact, the whole Mardi gras sequence (that psychedelic cemetery trip scene) is staggeringly brilliant yet completely mind-numbing in that it is so out of place it becomes a deterrent to the film, not an aid.  The eventual ending, while wholly prolific and steeped in profound insight, is more of a head-scratcher than anything else.  I think that is my biggest complaint with the films second half (which is far better than the droned out first half).  It is entirely inconsistent and winds up lacking any cohesive feeling.<br /><br />But, there is always Jack Nicholson.  His performance is one of the best supporting performances of all time.  It is slick with wit, intelligence, bravado and profound sentiment.  He ties together a lot of loose ends about the `meaning' here, without ever feeling out of place or forced.  His charisma is in tact and his humor is just what this film needed.  I won't demean him by using the phrase `comic relief', but I will say that he spices up a film in dire need of some `spice'.<br /><br />Jack playing Jack to perfection.<br /><br />In the end, I have to say that I am NOT impressed with this one.  I was really excited about seeing this, but halfway through I was aching to turn it off.  The only reason I watched it through to completion was the fact that I wanted to see what Nicholson did here, and I'm glad I witnessed that performance.  So, if you are a fan of Jack then see this, for it is one of his best turns (he should have won the Oscar for this), but the film as a whole is not only outdated but uninspired, clumsy and boring.<br /><br />This is the definition of a missed opportunity.and his humor is just what this film needed.

More than any book I can remember reading, what he is building here is a character. The plot and the action are deeply satisfying but the reason I keep turning the pages is to learn more about Kvothe and his story.  The dedication at the beginning says, \\"And to my father, who taught me that if I was going to do something, I should take my time and do it right the first time.\\"  This book is story-telling done right.

1423113381|4.0|Because I so thoroughly enjoyed Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympians series (first book: [[ASIN:B002VGXM9C The Lightning Thief]]), I was happy to see a new series from him coming so soon after [[ASIN:1423101472 The Last Olympian]]. Riordan is smart enough not to mess too much with success - The Kane Chronicles also deals with ancient gods - this time Egyptian - and kids with newly discovered special powers. Luckily, he is also talented enough to keep this, the first of a planned trilogy, from seeming like a carbon copy of the characters and adventures found in the Percy Jackson series.<br /><br />Sadie and Carter Kane are siblings who were separated quite young in life after the death of their mother. (Aside: I loved that their father is African American and their mother Caucasian - I'm all for increasing cultural diversity in children's and YA books.) Carter traveled the world with his archeologist father while Sadie, his junior by two years, lived a more \\"normal\\" life in England with their grandparents. They only spend two days a year together with their father and it is on one of these occasions that we are dropped into their story.  The action begins immediately with explosive displays of magic and the disappearance of their father. The siblings - whose powers are enhanced when they are together (which turns out to be one reason why they were raised separately) - begin making one startling discovery after another about themselves and their family and are set on course to rescue their father and (of course) to save the world from the evil forces their father unwittingly released from the Rosetta Stone. A variety of ancient Egyptian forces - both good and evil - appear to help or hinder them on their quest.<br /><br />Riordan has a gift for making his characters come to life and for making us care about them, a skill I enjoyed in the Percy Jackson books and again here. The Red Pyramid is told from both Sadie and Carter's POV, with each chapter narrated by one of the two. Their voices are somewhat similar, but distinctive enough to make this work and I enjoyed getting to know these two bright, brave and adaptable kids better through this device.  The action is virtually non-stop and the 500+ pages seem to fly by. IMHO, the many characters and creatures will probably be enjoyed more by readers 10 years old and over than by those under 10, but, of course, parents should judge that for themselves.<br /><br />I found this a fast, fun read and am happy to recommend it. I hope that it will inspire kids to want to know more about ancient Egypt, one of the most fascinating civilizations our world has known and I would encourage parents to rent some kid-friendly documentaries about ancient Egypt once their children have finished The Red Pyramid.<br /><br />Readers who fall in love with this story and are intrigued by the Egyptian aspects of it may enjoy these other stories while waiting for the Kanes to return in book two: The Theodosia Throckmorton series consisting of [[ASIN:0618999760 Theodosia and the Serpents of Chaos]], [[ASIN:0618927646 Theodosia and the Staff of Osiris]] and [[ASIN:054722592X Theodosia and the Eyes of Horus]]; The Children of the Lamp series, which begins with [[ASIN:0439670209 The Akhenaten Adventure]] and [[ASIN:0810983788 The Pharaoh's Secret]].wo.

B000YI7MRM|4.0|Alatriste has some brilliant scenes. Many such as the theater and the battle scenes, were fascinating viewing. I particularly liked the costumes and setting which are good. It shows that  considerable effort has gone into making them authentic for the era.     The acting is also good. Some of the characters need more development. It is like their parts have been edited out.       The problem is the film is we are following the life of a soldier that has no purpose. The film does not go anywhere. I suspect the story is too large for the movie and too much edited out.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I don't understand how anyone could rate this show below a 4.  I was tempted to click on the 6 reviews that gave it one star - but then I realized it would make me too angry to read the nonsense that they had written.    The characters in Mad Men are complex and interesting.  One minute you are on their side and the next, you're cursing them out.  I find that I can relate to every single one of the characters' struggles.     All of the dramatic and sometimes amusing events that unfold are done with absolutely beautiful sets, costumes, and cinematography.  The soundtrack is always amazing and right on point. After each episode - I feel inspired to create art or redecorate the house, or dress up.  Not many shows have that effect on me!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Having seen the Celtic Woman in concert, this CD serves as a testimony to their brilliance.  I find that listening to this album is (almost) like being at the concert.  I listen to it all the time.  Pretty soon I'll have to reorder a copy because this one is well-worn!

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I haven't seen all Miyazaki's films (I'm in the process of doing it) but the four I've seen until now are masterpieces. Hayao Miyazaki may be the greatest animator in the world, his films combines beautiful, detailed hand-drawn backgrounds and stories that engage you with excellent stories and great characters. The films that I've seen so far are My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Ponyo (all excellent).<br /><br />I've read some reviews that this is a light effort from Miyazaki. I disagree. I think that the master animator divides into two categories: the all innocent, sweet and simple films (My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service and Ponyo) and the much more complex, ambigous ones (Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso, Mononoke, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle). Both categories are excellent in their own right and serve to satisfy people of all ages.<br /><br />Ponyo is an excellent film. Here in Ecuador unfortunately Disney understandably does not release Studio Ghibli films in theaters. While that's a shame, I understand that this films are not all quite embraced by the public in the West (although their following is increasing), so I have to buy it through Amazon. I was impressed by the beautifullness of the film. From the beginning it takes your breath away by showing you stunning scenes of the sea and the land. The story is really simple but I think that is one of the many strengths of the film. The characters are great and the two children behave properly as five year old should. Miyazaki takes inspiration in The Little Mermaid but give the film his own identity which we all have learn to love.<br /><br />Ponyo is a sweet, simple, beautiful film that will lift your spirits and will make you smile thoughout it and after it. 5 stars. Totally recommended.

1439102813|5.0|The way the book reads is subtly clever and very engrossing: while written in the third person it *feels* like it is written from Alice's perspective.  As her disease progresses, the structure of the book changes and parallels the mental state of Alice...it's very clever and done flawlessly.  The book became engrossing very quickly, and all the realities that existed for the characters, things that exist between the lines of text, unspoken but nevertheless obvious to the average reader, tug out tears and profound acknowlegement for the disease.  A good book.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|I do not have a 3D television but I did not see Avatar in 3D in the theater. My son has a huge television screen and had not seen the film. We watched only an hour of it because of committments that day and my granddaughter was mesmerized. He has a great sound system and the Blu-ray sound was awesome. When I left he asked,\\"Will you leave \\"Avatar\\" here, it is so awesome, I want to see it all\\". Nuff said. Anything that can engage a thirty two year old engineer and a two year old girl is worth it. I thought it was great for the money and available technology.

This is a great concert to watch over and over!  I'm in my early 40's and a musician myself as well.  John has learned the farthest reaches of his voice and guitar and put them together to produce wonderful songs.  I'm lovin' the blues part of his repertoire!  This should be a part of his career for years to come.  I realize he's trying to please the younger crowd but don't give up on us that love your Blues, John!  We all know this and so do you that the Blues is in you, it's a part of you!  This part alone was money enough for me to buy this video.  Go out and get this!  You won't be disappointed!!!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I ordered this for my parents. I didn't watch this but they said it was THE BEST cowboy movie they have ever watched. They watched one episode a day to make it last a while. They could hardly wait to watch each consecutive episode because it was so good.   They were warned by someone else that this movie had cursing in it which my parents do not approve of. However, they told me it did not have any cursing in it. They were completely happy with this mini-series and had nothing but great things to say about it which in my opinion equates to a 5 star rating.
0765363836|3.0|Intriguing premise, and reasonably successful execution. It's also fun to compare and contrast with the screenplays for the current tv series with the same title. Specifically, the book envisions a relatively distant \\"flashforward,\\" while the tv scripts employ are much closer date. The human impacts of the two alternatives are both similar and interestingly different.

B002WY65VU|3.0|Zombieland was not what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting more of a Night of the Living Dead type of film. The beginning and end had zombies, but not much action in the middle of the film.<br /><br />The middle of this film kind of dragged, especially the Bill Murray part.<br />Not a bad movie. It's fun to watch but it's not a scary horror movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I had heard great reviews about this production on the stage and how great the music was.  I decided to get the cd in order to get a preview.  It is great music and now I can't wait until I can get to the theatre to see it!
1590171993|4.0|Granted, this isn't a exciting read; however, it is a fulfilling read.  Stoner, the mediocre professor at the University of Missouri at first study could be considered a failure.  Almost all of his relationships could be summed up as cold and distant: his parents, wife, and child.  In the midst of that throw in a middle age torrid love affair with a younger colleague; even that affair hardly rocks his world.  He lets the world and those around him determine who is he rather than ever rebelling against unfairness, boredom, or tradition.  Yet, in spite of all that, in my opinion, he moves from a tragic figure to one that is to be respected (admired is too strong a word).  Stoner is indeed a rock.  Through the ups and downs of a marriage and a career, he remains solidly the same.      The writing is beautiful in this book.  The story is poignant, thoughtful, and though provoking.
1591843162|1.0|I would have given this book 2 stars, but the sheer number of 5 star reviews for a book that clearly doesn't deserve it demanded that I lower my rating to 1 star.    I had to literally force myself to read this book all the way through. The book consists of two or three basic ideas that would have made a fine magazine article. In this book, the same material is repeated over and over and over until you want to scream \\"Stop! I get it!\\"    In addition, the material doesn't seem organized in any logical way. It reads more like a series of disjointed blog posts than a book. In typical Seth Godin fashion, the book never gets specific or tells the reader how to actually accomplish anything. It's mostly airy theory--there's very little that's of practical use. Godin is aware of this criticism and deflects it in the book, saying  that if he could tell you anything concrete, it means there's already an existing roadmap, and you have to create your own roadmap. So you never get any practical advice, just a lot of platitudes. At times, I felt I was reading \\"Be Here Now.\\"    Godin's definition of \\"art\\" is a bit strange. Contrary to Godin's assertion, being good at one's job or putting in extra effort at work doesn't make one an artist. As romantic as it sounds, when a waiter asks you if you'd like more rolls or fills up your water glass without asking, that doesn't make him an artist. Creating art makes one an artist.    Godin's belief that the great artists made art because they were interested in giving to the world and that commerce never entered into it is simply not accurate. Many of the great artists of the past worked for a patron, who paid them to create art--for them. Many of the famous portraits you see in art museums were commissions-- essentially commercial art.    The most valuable concept in this book is the idea that if you're indispensable to your organization, it will be hard for your boss to fire you. I basically just saved you the price of the book.

0385341008|5.0|Everyone has been talking about this book, which is usually a reason for me NOT to read it.  It seems the more popular a book is, the less I like it.<br /><br />That was not the case with Guernsey.<br /><br />My cousin loaned me her copy around Christmas and I finally got around to reading it last week.  I absolutely love anything set in the WWII era and this story was no exception.  I loved the language, I loved the characters (Juliet's personality is so spunky).  I was unsure how I would like the fact that the entire book is made up of a series of letters, but this book was so well put together that after a few pages I hardly noticed anymore.  I will be buying my own copy this weekend...I'll definitely want to re-read this one.

B002E9HACG|2.0|I use to love Europe back in the day even though i was a bigger \\"metal head\\" than anything, mostly because of the guitar playing and Tempest's voice. Well with these most recent albums as most bands they have chose to go down hill on both routes. Tempest doesnt sing at all like he use to, and the guitar playing is just strumming riffs with no feeling and no soul. Also there is nothing catching about any of the songs, just monotone vocals and chorus's to boot. The same can be said of bands like Tesla, Poison, Lynch Mob, White Lion, just to name a few, they have all just toned down and don't have that real eighties sound anymore. I think thats what people want, but in order to \\"try\\" and be relevant today all the 80's hair bands are jumping on the Creed, Breaking Benjamin, Daugherty band wagon. This just doesnt work for these bands, they need there balls back, with shredding solos, keyboards and over the top high range vocals, most could still do it, but choose not to. The only album i've heard that is decent and i don't mean the whole album is Winger's Karma, at least it still has some guts left. No one said these bands could ever \\"write good lyrics\\" most relied on musicianship and could play there butts off, well sorry to say those days are gone. This Europe Album in particular tries hard to fit with old Europe and a new age Europe but fails in all aspects and is just plain boring. R.I.P Europe, i wish Kee Marcello was still around, he would give them a kick in the right direction, guaranteed.:D
1439190275|5.0|Having eaten a low carb diet for nearly fifteen years now, (spending much of my time coming up with low carb recipes [[ASIN:1592334148 1001 Low-Carb Recipes: Hundreds of Delicious Recipes from Dinner to Dessert That Let You Live Your Low-Carb Lifestyle and Never Look Back]]) with nothing but great health to show for it, I'm a huge fan of Dr. Atkins.  Having met Dr. Eric Westman, and followed his research for the past several years, I'm a huge fan of his, too.  New Atkins For a New You is a more than worthy successor to Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution.    How does New Atkins For A New You differ from DANDR?      * They've lost the focus on ketosis.  Oh, you'll still go into ketosis if you eat the way they tell you, and that's a good thing -- it means you're running a fat-burning rather than a glucose-burning metabolism.  It also feels great -- high energy, suppressed appetite, and a clear head.  Great mood, too; ketosis makes me ebullient.  But there's no peeing on ketostix.  Ketostix told people less than they thought:  They can tell you that you're burning fat, but they can't tell you if you're burning fat you just ate, or fat from your storage depots.  And ketostix are expensive.  Some people do find \\"turning purple\\" motivating, but this is a useful simplification.    *  They've incorporated the net carbs concept, as pioneered by Drs. Michael and Mary Dan Eades, instructing people to subtract fiber grams from total grams of carbohydrate.  This makes for more vegetables from the get-go,since quite a lot of the carbohydrate in vegetables is in the form of fiber.  Also makes for a little more fruit and possibly a little whole grain in the later stages of the diet.  Most low carbers were already doing this, but since DANDR was published before the Eades wrote Protein Power, it wasn't \\"in the book.\\"  It is now.  They've also expanded the list of vegetables allowed on \\"Induction,\\" the super-low-carb introductory phase.    *  They've added sodium, in the form of broth, soy sauce, or a few other options.  Because dropping insulin levels drastically, as a low carb diet does, enables the body to properly excrete sodium, they found some people were feeling washed out, or even light-headed.  Adding sodium fixes the problem.  (Also keep in mind that by knocking out the vast majority of processed foods, the diet eliminates a big whack of the sodium in the Standard American Diet.    * They allow caffeine.  Woo-hoo!  (I'm betting this was the most-violated Atkins no-no.)  Say that the research says caffeine aids fat burning and is perfectly healthy stuff, and anyway tea and coffee are loaded with antioxidants.  She said with a cup of tea in front of her.    *  Also alcohol in moderation after the Induction phase.    *  They include vegetarian options.  This is the only part of the new version about which I have mixed feelings.  The vegetarian options are heavy on the soy products, and I'm completely un-sold on the benefits of soy.   OTOH, I know for certain that being fat and running high insulin levels is deadly.  I would personally urge vegetarians to rely more heavily on eggs and cheese, and have been forthright in stating that I don't consider veganism to be nutritionally adequate.  But if this is what it takes to get vegetarians lower their carb intake, that's a good thing.  I've known too many long-time vegetarians who have found themselves in pre-diabetes or even full-blown diabetes.    *  Perhaps most important, Drs. Westman, Volek, and Phinney cover the multitudinous research demonstrating the many health benefits of carbohydrate restriction that has happened since DANDR was written.  If you haven't been keeping up, you'll be impressed as heck.    This is the best-of-breed of the low carbohydrate diet books to come out in the past decade.  Buy it.  Read it.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|I had some fears about Robert Downey playing the great Sherlock Holmes--but they were quickly dispelled during the film's exciting opening.  Downey's Holmes if far more active then Basil Rathbone--but still fits comfortably into the Arthur Conan Doyle mold.  Doyle's Holmes was a boxer, stick fighter, and master of an obscure Asian Martial Art--so is Downey's, and if his lack of hygiene and occasional sloppiness can be ignored, his version of the master Detective is more or less on model.  The special effects in this one are first rate and the supporting cast, particularly Jude Law, is exceptional.  A nice film--and I look forward to the sequel which shall inevitably come our way.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|I'm a Lil Wayne fan and I love hard rock but this release is embarrassing.  Only good track is \\"Drop the World\\" because Eminem spits so hard on it.  I literally threw this cd out.

Holden's masterful retelling of the Lewis Carroll classic, appropriately entitled [[ASIN:0982508999 Alice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland]]. These mournful words could just as easily be attributed to the bewildered moviegoer who has shelled out good money for Tim Burton's spectacle-without-substance sequel to that same Carroll classic. As the credits roll and the truth settles in, it is the advice of the wily Cheshire Cat in Holden's book that haunts with its greater truth:    \\"If you really must go, then it's best you should know  That to find you need only to seek--  But in seeking and finding, you may need reminding,  Once found, is what's sought worth a peek?\\"
0439023483|3.0|\\"Hunger Games\\" is a young adult science-fiction suspense novel. The premise--sending teens into a game that requires them to kill each other--also qualifies it as a horror novel, in my opinion.<br /><br />The story was very exciting and fast-paced. For the first two-thirds of the story, there was barely a pause in the danger-laden action filled with unexpected twists. The world-building was very good and brought the story alive in my imagination. The characters were interesting, and there were many very nice characters risking themselves to help Katniss survive. I liked the potential of Katniss more than I actually liked her. She wanted to be nice, but she thought everyone was out for themselves so she rarely trusted others and her main goal was survival at whatever cost.<br /><br />I read the book because my 12-year-old friend wanted me to, because of the suspense, and because I thought Katniss would be pushed to the point of boldly defying the evil of the Hunger Games. But her main goal was to survive and avoid conflict. Even her minor defiances stayed within the rules and she eagerly cooperated in trying to patch up any damage done by them to The Capital's power. She lied knowing it would be hurtful to someone she cared about and was willing to kill people she liked in order to survive. Only some fancy footwork on the part of the author kept Katniss from facing much moral dilemma about her actions and intentions.<br /><br />By the time the Feast came about (near the end of the book), I had concluded that Katniss wouldn't stand up against the Hunger Games, no matter how cruel or how much she disliked them. By this point in the story, there were also a bunch of inconsistencies--including a critical one that meant the story wouldn't have played out the way it did.<br /><br />(Explanation, SPOILER alert: Peeta said that his family only ate stale bread. Thus, Peeta's mother would never have told him to feed fresh, slightly-burned bread to the pigs--which formed the bond between Katniss and Peeta--when his family could have enjoyed the bread themselves. END SPOILER)<br /><br />At this point, the pacing was also slower so I started to notice things like how fresh, unpreserved meat stayed good for days despite very hot days (it would have spoiled much sooner), how Katniss never thought to use the iodine for medicine when it might have made a big difference, how she hid some knives yet never thought to go back to get them when she needed them, and how she didn't even try to use her weapons when captured by an opponent intending to torture her to death.<br /><br />In my opinion, it basically fell apart at the end, and I stopped caring about the story. Some readers might not catch the inconsistencies or care as long as there's great action, but I do.<br /><br />There was no sex. I don't recall any bad language. The gore was left to the readers imagination. The novel was written in first person, present tense.

I would suggest that these reborn hippies look up one of the great semi-retired lead guitarists of the heyday of the music they seek to recreate. Maybe give Larry \\"Rhino\\" Rheinhardt or Harvey Mandel a call and I would make this group a regular listen.

Alice, a Harvard psychology professor, is quickly losing the most prized part of herself...her mind, her ability to keep up with her peers and to maintain her status as a world leader in her field.<br /><br />The story begins with long-established relationships that quickly shift. It was interesting to see the reactions of Alice's family members and peers as her mental health rapidly declined. Genova did a great job of creating memorable characters -- a husband who couldn't be more inconvenienced by his wife's illness and soon faces a choice between his career and wife. The three adult children react to mother's change in distinct ways.  I enjoyed watching Alice's relationship with \\"the actress\\" evolve into something very beautiful. An early scene where Alice is introduced to a co-worker's wife and a few minutes later reintroduces herself as if they've never met is difficult to witness because it feels so real.<br /><br />Alice sets up a daily test to help her know when she's lost too much of herself, to let her know when her life has reached its rightful end. This was very cleaver structure and serves as a sign post for each turn in the road.<br /><br />This book left me with greater empathy and understanding of what's lost by Alzheimer, not just for the one with the disease, but for the family, friends, coworkers, caregivers, etc. It was sad to watch the family argue over what's best for Alice as she sat there ignored and unable to express her thoughts or desires.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about early onset Alzheimer.<br /><br />Marie Estorge<br />author of Storkbites: A Memoir and<br />Confessions of a Bi-Polar Mardi Gras Queen<br />Visit [...].
B00005JMXX|5.0|I saw \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" when it first hit the theaters and enjoyed it very much. I recently bought it on DVD and found, in it, many ideas and concepts that I had missed the first time around.<br /><br />This movie has been attacked because, among other things, the events happen too quickly to represent reality accurately. Well, after some investigation into the subject, I learned that this scenario is probably exactly what happened at the beginning of the last Ice Age over 20,000 years ago.<br /><br />This was referenced briefly in the scene in the Museum of Natural History when the staring characters were shocked to learn that the Woolly Mammoth displayed was found with fresh food in it's mouth and stomach (true story re: NY Museum of Natural History)indicating that it had been frozen solid in a matter of minutes or even seconds.<br /><br />The movie is based on the book: \\"The Coming Super Storm\\" by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber (recommended reading).<br /><br />I recommend to ignore the \\"naysayers\\" and look at the Science implied with fresh eyes and open mind.<br /><br />Ed In WA
0307266303|5.0|This is the best book on Running I've read. Period.     Some background on me - I hated runnning about 4 years ago! I got into it when a bunch of colleagues at work were signing up for a MS Walk/ Run 10K and huffed and puffed my way through it. Since then I've come a long way - running 4 Half marathons in the last year and shaving off minutes on every one of them.     With that background, it is easy to see that I wasn't necessarily looking for motivation to run, but, I got more than a fair share of that, from reading this book. More importantly I was very impressed by how the author presents references to less known people that have helped push running beyond what we thought was humanly possible. Most people with a slight interest in running have heard about Dean Karnazes and the Pam Reed, but, McDougall goes way beyond them to bring to focus several other ultra marathoners who haven't necessarily received the same kind of public attention (like 7 time Badwater winner Scott Jurek).    What also impressed me was the detailed research into the \\"Persistence Hunting\\" theory. I wasn't familiar with this at all and I am now very eager to read more about it.    Overall a great read for experienced runners and a must read for those that look at running as a \\"necessary evil\\" to stay in shape (and should rather treat is a natural extension of who they are as a race!)... my 2 cents!

B000000H5K|3.0|It's easiest to view Roots as one of the following: it's either one of the most innovative alternative and/or nu metal albums with its tribal embodyment throughout, or it's a complete regression from the [[ASIN:B000000H3Z Beneath the Remains]] days. It's very easy to agree with one of these statements, seeing that this album was released during the impending uprise of nu-metal in the late 90's, and the band managed to entwine tribal elements in very obvious ways with this album.<br /><br />I am a fan of Sepultura's releases before this, and [[ASIN:B000000H4V Chaos A.D.]], while it signalled a change in sound, was still an excellent album with memorable grooves and drum fills. With \\"Roots\\", the guitars are tuned lower, everything sounds distorted (even Max Cavalera, who would make his last appearance here), and there are so many elements that would sound really out of place in their earlier albums, such as a turntable and maracas. In all honesty, this could have worked out well and could have been a high point in experimentation in metal, but let's just say that I wasn't kidding when I mentioned that the outside elements are way too obvious that they get in the way. Tracks like \\"Ratamahatta\\" and \\"Lookaway\\" are two shining examples of how this falls flat by covering up extremely simple songwriting with guest vocals and tribal instruments.<br /><br />However, I'm not saying that this whole album is a bust. Sometimes, it can work well, like in \\"Attitude\\" and \\"Cut-Throat\\", which are some tracks that are to the point and not sounding like a complete mess. \\"Roots Bloody Roots\\" has a downtuned riff that'll get stuck in your head (whether you view it as a good or bad thing is up to you). My main gripe with this album isn't necessarily the change in sound, but instead, it is how it is executed.<br /><br />With that said, this is better than the following three Soulfly albums that would follow that beat this formula to the ground. It is interesting to an extent, and yes, it is original when compared to the faceless nu and groove metal bands that came out during this time. However, this could have been done so much better. If you're warming up to the back catalog of Sepultura in their prime, this or Chaos A.D. is a good starter album.ed to the faceless nu and groove metal bands that came out during this time.

B00042YBTK|4.0|Repertoire REPUK 1056 (2004)  This re-issue of a long-lost and seldom heard classic has been very nicely restored and remastered. The sound is superior to even the latest Beatles' catalog re-releases. It appears that Repertoire went back to the original multi-track masters for this remaster, and the result is terrific! The sound is lively, strong, and has \\"punch\\" without being overwhelming (as so many modern-day releases are as if engaged in some sort of \\"volume wars\\"). This rejuvenated collection will not tax your ears, and you will definitely want to play it.    About the music: this final release from Eric and his Animals is a great glimpse into the psychedelia-meets-blues style of music which briefly appeared towards the close of the `60's. All of the covers on this disc are entirely Eric and the Animals' own and only loosely resemble the original versions. Of particular note is some fine guitar work on the Traffic cover \\"Coloured Rain\\" and the Deadric Malone penned \\"As Tears Go Passing By.\\" Another tune certainly worthy of mention is the band's cover of the Dantalian's Chariot tune \\"The Madman (Running Through The Fields)\\": this tune, coincidentally, features Dantalian's Chariot members Zoot Money and Andy Summers - both of whom appear here again in the Animals covering their own song!    On the down side of this album is that it does not seem to feature Eric Burdon enough! This is all the more ironic - and disappointing - considering the band were now calling themselves \\"Eric Burdon and the Animals.\\" Eric's talent simply seems to be underutilized in this incarnation of The Animals as compared to, say, Roger Daltrey's role in The Who, even though Eric is at least equal to Daltrey in ability and talent. Here, Eric is reduced to what seems to be merely a band member rather than being the cornerstone of the group as in earlier versions of the band.     On the whole, I love the energy and style of this album, and it is great to hear this truly outstanding restoration of recordings from one of rock and roll's most amazing and dynamic singers at this brief window in rock and roll history. If you are an Animals fan, you will certainly enjoy this one. In summary, for me, this album is a great little \\"nugget,\\" and I certainly would recommend it. I give this one `two thumbs up!'

B000QUCNOK|1.0|This movie was awful. An Ode to serial killing. I do understand that apparently the book gererated quite a fan club.  I think that most people that did not read the book will HATE the movie.<br /><br />NOTHING about the plot is realistic. It is ALL totally absurd. For example, one CAN distill the essence of roses by distilling their oils out of many pounds of rose petals.  Does this suggest that you can distill the \\"essence\\" of a beautiful woman by either boiling her entire body in a kettle of hot water (a la chicken soup) or alternatively by spreading animal fat on her skin and scraping it off and then distilling the glob?  Not likely, yet this this the central premise of the movie.<br /><br />Who can buy into such nonsense?  The final scene is a farcical sex orgy in which 750 or so naked people make love in a town square -- all while somehow always hiding their private parts from the camera's view -- all under the capative spell of the fragerance of 13 slaughtered women.  Right!!  That makes sense, right?<br /><br />Viewers be warned: bring your barf bag.
030726839X|5.0|So many books have been written about Churchill, in particular about the wartime years, that another biography might be needless.  However, Max Hastings presents a wonderfully balanced portrait of the man, the politician and the statesman.  While in no way a revisionist history, Hastings has used distance and time to place Churchill's immense contribution in historial perspective.  It is fascinating to compare the Churchill revealed in the \\"War Diaries of Field Marshall Lord Alanbrooke\\" (from which Mr. Hastings quotes) with Hastings' own work.  Two brillant accounts, one immediate with short term judgements and Mr. Hastings's more measured and from a distance.<br /><br />Churchill's rhetoric and prose shaped the common view of the conduct of WWII.  Brave little Britain fighting alone.  \\"The Few, we will fight them on the beaches and never surrender.\\" How Churchill's phrases captured and continue to color the imagination.  Much less widely recognized are Britain's problems during wartime.  In a sense disguised by Churchill's masterful language the strikes, the attitudes and the actions of the many Communist sympathizers and the often poor performance of Britain's own Army (especially in the war's early years) have tended to fade from popular viewpoint.  Mr. Hastings deals with the good, the bad and the downright ugly without flinching and without using criticism to deflect from what was an overall immense achievement.<br /><br />Whatever Churchill's failings(and he was human), Max Hastings points out without Winston Churchill at the head of government, Britain would have probably capitulated in 1940-41.  Churchill did not simply capture the British spirit, he to some extend, created it as this book makes clear.  Had Churchill not done so, the outcome could have been entirely different or, at least, more protracted and bloody without Britain as a base to launch the killer blow upon Nazi Germany.<br /><br />Initially, having read many Churchill biographies I was afraid this might be a revisionist history that so many authors are prone to write simply to sell their work. Max Hastings' book about this great man who occupied this pivotal moment is well balanced and researched.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this period of history.  I have read many books by Max Hastings and this is one of his best. I also recommend the \\"War Diaries of Field Marshall Lord Alanbrooke\\" to gain even further perspective on the effect an individual can have on history.<br /><br />Enjoy the read!this might be a revisionist history that so many authors are prone to write simply to sell their work.

1584282584|5.0|What a great book....if you are struggling with flash, and specifically using an atttached speedlight or speedlite to your DSLR..this is the book for you.    -This book not only tells you multiple ways to determine correct exposure but it then shows you how to do them all and gives tips on which method is best used.    -If you are confused about how to read histograms...this book will clarify and show you how to read them in simple terms.    -Multiple picture examples showing how the same setting would look at different exposures..including available light.    -Shows how to use the in-camera light meter.    -Not only does it explain the flash sync speed but it gives creative examples of using different shutter speeds and how to set your flash to fire at different stages of the shutter's release.    -The book gives you the lowdown on effective and low cost light modifiers for bouncing flash and evening out flash colors with ambient lighting tones.    -Above all, this book shows you how to use your flash by bouncing it off various objects and improving overall lighting.    *This being said, MANY if not all of the photographs shown were taken at 'high' ISO speeds. They looked fine printed in the book...but if you are a Computer pixel-peeper...you might be upset at the use of 400-1200 ISO in some of the photographs. As an owner of Canon's 7D..this isn't a problem for me because of my camera's excellent capablilities at such high ISO. might be a problem for other camera's users.

B00275EGWY|5.0|I'll start by saying that I was a soldier in Baghdad (and Diyala province) in a combat unit(though in 2007-08 not 2004).  Having said this, I will admit that this movie had several inaccuracies.  Several suspensions of the truth.  However, I still find this movie to be outstanding. As a work of art, and a work of pure psychology, it blew me away (pun not intended).  Some items I couldn't relate to, but others brought me back to Baghdad.  The way they portrayed the Iraqis was really very good.  The kids, the way that everybody was in every direction, never knowing who wants to kill you, it was disturbingly accurate.  I liked the transition at the end (spoiler coming) of the battle tested veteran shopping for cereal.  It really spoke to me.  Don't look at this picture as a 100% accurate description of the war.  Feel the paranoia, the fear, the rush; that is what it is conveying, not the word for word history, but the emotion of the Iraq war.  The only thing that really ticked me off was that they were in ACUs in 2004, those weren't issued or available till 2005.
B000QUT9RY|5.0|for the last 10 years I have used a mini stereo as my computer speakers, had the analog go into the JVC CD player/receiver, and the 10 watt speakers worked perfectly, I just liked the sound better than cheap computer speakers and didn't want a 5.1 setup.  After I built my last computer I noticed a buzzing coming from the speakers which was really annoying (and this happened when no cell phones were around it).  I read that an optical connection should eliminate this problem.  So I starting looking for a pair of speakers with optical in, but the trick was that I didn't want a 5.1 system, just wanted 2 speakers which for me is great for games and casual music listening.      I found these speakers which seemed to be just what I needed, the price was a little steep for computer speakers but since I also wanted quality I had to except it.  Hooked them up last night, no more buzzing, the sound is GREAT, I couldn't believe how clear and crisp it was and it had decent base too.  I was a little dissapointed there was no subwoofer out since I do have a mini sub in that room, but don't really need it.  I cranked it up to see how much space it would fill and I could hear it perfectly clear in both bedrooms on the same level without maxing the volume.      These speakers are a little big, bigger than my mini stereo JVC speakers but they aren't too bad, right speaker is sort of heavy as that has the amp in it, left is pretty light.   I would recommend these for anyone wanting computer speakers with optical in and don't need full surround sound for their games, no better option out there.
B001G6UENK|5.0|This album is not for the faint of heart.  It is not background dinner music.  I suppose if you're looking for Eric Dolphy records that's probably not quite what you're looking for.  That being said this is a fantastic record.  Eric Dolphy plays alto sax, bass clarinet and flute.  Freddie Hubbard is on trumpet. Richard Davis keeps it mean on the bass fiddle.  Bobby Hutcherson keeps some truly remarkable sounds out of the vibes on this album.  Prepared vibes perhaps? I hope someone with more knowledge of the instrument could clarify this for me.  Lastly, the incomparable Tony Williams on trap.  I think I could just sit there and listen to no one but Tony.   That's how good he sounds.  This album is kind of scary and delightful all at the same time.  Definitely an essential album for anyone into free jazz or music that's just bizarre and outside of the box.  It makes me sad that Eric  died so young.

What they find in the safety deposit boxes will lead to murder, blackmail, and an international man hunt. The aftermath of the robbery made me think of the airport heist in the movie Goodfellas.     At first the movie seems a little weird and disjointed but stick with it, these seemingly disjointed storylines weave together to make a good, fast, entertaining flick.

0785134352|5.0|By graphic, I mean there is enough blood spilt here to fill a swimming pool thanks to John Romita Jr.'s great artwork and the generous use of the color red.  Mark Millar takes \\"ordinary\\" kids like Dave Lizewski (a.k.a. Kick-Ass) and Mindy McCready (a.k.a. Hit-Girl) and transforms them into ultimate fighting machines.  Kick-Ass is full of attitude and over-the-top action sequences.  Millar points out that you don't have to have special powers and super strength in order to be a superhero...all you need is a big heart.  And a great costume.  I highly recommend this book.
B00192IV0O|4.0|I'm surprised how people rate albums based on originality. It's like that's the only criteria for determining the album's quality. To me, this album is original enough. It's not the most original I've ever heard, however, one of the most original bands I ever heard last weekend in Silver Lake, CA, to me, wasn't very good. What's important are several qualities: originality, melody, vocals, lyrics, and consistency. Based on those qualities, which can be altered by auto-tune and not affect quality, I believe \\"The END\\" is a good album. Don't listen to it expecting a profound dissertation on life. John Frusciante's solo albums, for example, provide a deep examination of the world. Listen to \\"The End\\" to feel happy, confident, and carefree. Those are the themes they want you to enjoy.     Summary:   Originality: 3/5  Melody: 5/5    Vocals: 4/5   Lyrics: 3/5  Consistency: 5/5
B003CR9BYE|5.0|By the time Tom Jobim was summoned to California in 1967 to record these songs with Sinatra, Bossa Nova had lost the luster and popularity it had enjoyed in the early 1960's thanks to the British invasion and other changes in popular taste and culture.<br /><br />Sinatra might seem like the worst possible choice for Bossa Nova. Its best singer has always been Joao Gilberto whose vocals are almost always soft and subdued. How could the man who belted out My Way sing something delicate like Desafinado? Well he did and it works.<br /><br />Sinatra learned his craft from Tommy Dorsey and Harry James in the 1940's and knew all about rhythm and swing which make this recording so compelling.<br /><br />Hearing Jobim sing with Sinatra is always a treat as it was in the Sinatra's Duets II album which was one of Jobim's last. The brash kid from Hoboken with the shy kid from Rio.<br /><br />Jobim has been called the Gershwin of Brazil, but I prefer to think of Gershwin as the Jobim of America.<br /><br />The best Jazz singers such as Sinatra and Billie Holiday are masters of phrasing and this is particularly necessary in Bossa Nova with its roots in Samba and Jazz.<br /><br />For fans of Sinatra and Jobim like me, this release is long overdue and self-recommending. Thanks to Concord Records for filling this hole in the catalogue. The numbers have a complicated history or recording and release. This release includes all tracks from the original Reprise album plus 3 from the follow-up Sinatra/ Jobim album that was issued on 8 track tape and then pulled and all copies destroyed. It is just nice to have them all together at last in what Nancy Sinatra calls the deluxe treatment.<br /><br />I particularly enjoy Sinatra's singing Corcovado Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars whose English lyricist, Gene Lees, another Canadian, died only days ago.<br /><br />Sinatra swings and Jobim shines.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|Hooked on the first 3 books; then read the most recent and was unsatisfied completely. It went all over the place.    Now, after 5 years of waiting, I've decided to not purchase anything related to Martin until the entire series is completed - not just the next book, all of them. I don't want to waste my time reading and re-reading to remember after so many years, and then do it all again in another 5 or 6 years (or never).    I won't watch the movie either, not until the series is complete.
1400063736|2.0|I was looking forward to this book because I love all things New York and am fascinated particularly by the 1970's in NYC. I waited for the paperback to come out but read This Side of Brightness in the meantime to get tuned up on McCann's style. And I guess that is where my discomfort lies - he and I don't have chemistry because of his writing style. I wanted so much to love this book but found it had pacing and character problems. Using Petit's cable walk is both genius and kind of trite ('oh our precarious world'). This is at best a short story as it did not engage me over its length as a novel.
B000002H39|3.0|I rated this CD with three stars, but to me it's worth all five. I just wanted to be fair, because I realize that it doesn't hold the sentimental value with everyone else that it holds with me. As far as a review - what should anyone expect? Anita Baker's voice never changes, and either you love her or you don't -she's not one of those artists that intrigue you to say, \\"Hmmmmm, I wonder. I think I'll buy her CD.\\" If you loved Anita in the early eighties when she emerged, then you'll love her still.
1400032717|3.0|Well, I'll save you some time, this is not a mystery. The perpetrator is revealed early on. I thought it would be a quirky mystery, with the protagonist being different than your average protagonist. This book quickly evolves into something different. It is more along the lines of coming of age, a boring one. The book is not bad, the writing is decent. The story line is just boring. Like I said, the book is not necessarily bad, but there are millions of other books in the world, pick one of them instead.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Watching the DVD and listening to this music brings back a lot of memories of great music.  The music of Carole King and James Taylor is timeless.  I have never had the chance to see them perform at the Troubadour in Hollywood, but watching this CD and DVD combo is the next best thing.  Their voices compliment each other well on the song \\"Up On The Roof\\". This is my favorite track because it really shows that they enjoy performing together. Carole King still has the ability to touch me emotionally on the song \\"So Far Away\\".  This song can still bring  tears to my eyes. \\"Smackwater Jack\\" and \\"I Feel The Earth Move\\" are two classic songs that sound as fresh and groovy as they did forty years ago. Danny Kortchmar lends his talents playing the guitar on the song \\"Machine Gun Kelly\\". Danny gives this song an energetic kick with his playing. \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" is the perfect love song. Their voices sound perfect on this song together. \\"Blossom\\" is a song that puts my mind at ease. It is a song that I am not famillar with to be honest, but I love it after listening to it. Long time fans will love this. Younger people will love this music too.  All of these songs are so thoughtful and moving.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|First, I'll start with the obvious:    I saw Avatar in 3D as I know millions of others also did, and I have also watched it at home in 2D since it's release on DVD/Blu-ray. At the theater, to me it was visually incredible and I had not seen anything like it before. It was an acid trip without the acid. 2D at home was naturally not as stunning visually however the colors and scenery were still brilliant to take in.    The substance, or lack thereof:    The characters were flat. Despite spending nearly 3 hours watching this movie, I never saw a great effort to develop the characters in the story, save for the protaganist himself. The antagonists were predictable; invade, conquer, harvest. Essentially the idea of the villians themselves was derived from the American settlers arriving to the new world as occurred in American history. The Navi (the natives in the story) were essentially derived from the Native Americans who were treated so poorly by the settlers.     Everything seemed all too familiar, then it dawned on me...    I was essentially watching Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, and Fern Gully all mixed into one. The basis of the story could be linked back to elements of all three of these movies. The only real difference here was that the story has been spun by being set in a different location/time and then camouflaged with over-the-top (but I'll admit, gorgeous) visual effects.     Aftermath:  Avatar is being tagged now as \\"the number 1 movie of all time\\" on television ads for the DVD/Blu-Ray releases it. And by that they are only referring to its gross revenue at the box office because it is definitely NOT the #1 movie of all time.    Bottom line:    Watch it for the visuals because as I said before story isn't all that original. So, do I regret seeing Avatar? Definitely not. Did it raise the bar as far as what future movies will have to be in order to be great? Definitely not, except for maybe Avatar's one saving grace...our beloved visuals.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|I have to say, that the first season was a little bit slow.   But the second season is awesome!  Bridget Regan and Craig Horner play Kahlan Amnell and Richard Rahl/Cypher better than ever.  The whole season was very exciting. New secrets, new characters and a new Quest.   I hope that the actors decide to shoot a third season and will not end Legend of the Seeker.
B00364K6YW|4.0|The movie itself is the best version of Pride and Prejudice.  Mostly because it is unrushed an remains faithful to the book.  It's one of my favorite books, and also one of my favorite movies.  It's so nice when a movie does justice to a good book! I owned a previous release of this dvd, and I will say that the color and sharpness of the images seems improved.  Still, I was a little disappointed (if not surprised) that this is still on two discs.  Inevitable, perhaps, since it's a six part mini-series.  However, I dislike having to get up and switch discs in the middle of the movie.  Obviously, this is NOT a reason to avoid purchasing this.  But, it is the reason that I deducted a star.  Just in case someone is perfectly satisfied with their older set of P&P DVDs and only wanted these in the hope that it's one disc.  However, it being on two discs is not such a big deal; it's a long movie after all, odds are that you'll have to get up anyway!  It's just that \\"sometimes\\" it has a knack for needing a disc change right at the moment you were really into the movie and didn't want leave it for the realities of the DVD player.
B00138GY0I|4.0|MJ's new songs really showcase his versatility as a songwriter and singer.The 4 new songs alone make it worth buying the CD; or better yet, just download the individual MP3s now that they are available. But the re-mixes are a waste of studio time. I would have given this 5 stars if all of the songs had been MJ originals and not re-mixes by people other than MJ.
6305313687|5.0|For everyone who hates movies that deal with 'recism' - this movie is indeed for you. Why? Because it deals with it in a way that is most effective. I challenge any individual with even a tad bit of racism in him, to see this movie and not emerge a changed person. This isn't one of those phony-balloney type movies where blacks are jumping innocent whites on thir way to work, and whites are burning crosses on the lawns of innocent blacks as they sleep - and then miraculously in the end, they are all standing teary-eyed hand-in-hand singing Cum-bi-yah - all because some little black kid and some little white kid rose above racism and refused to surrendar their friendship to biggotry (cooooorneeee!). This movies doesn't insult the concept of reality in any way, but rather utilizes the concept in order to compose a movie so compelling that you won't be able to move when it's over, and you'll never forget it - ever.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I must admit I am not wild about James Horner's music. His work is often a hit and miss with me. I recently bought the soundtrack to the wildly popular James Cameron film Avatar. I really liked the elements of tribal music fused together with the more traditional orchestral sounds found in most film scores. I normally do not care for pop music nowadays but I actually liked  the Leona Lewis track \\"I See You\\", it is a beautiful ballad. My only gripe with the score is the \\"War\\" track which was a little too long for my liking but overall I enjoy listening to the soundtrack. I find the music very relaxing to listen to after a long day at the office.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Wow!  What a treat!  Saw this in the theatre at Tribeca Film Festival with a packed crowd.  It was extremely well done -- funny, informative, and all the topics were addressed (from the tragedies to the outrageous clothing styles).  I understand that the DVD may include an extra hour long bonus feature that were not in the theatre release.    Wall Street Journal gave it a great review and the movie won the festival's 2010 Heineken Audience Award.    Lots of great interviews with parents, rock stars, and the band. Quite an enjoyable experience.  A MUST buy for any Rush fan, and a fantastic treat for those of you who just appreciate a great rock documentary.  Will the ROck and Roll Hall of Fame be next? Enjoy....
B002VPE1AW|3.0|story was OK.  When I watch scifi I can suspend belief, but there has to be some kind of consistancy in the fictional universe.  A planet with all the species 6 limbed, except the humanoids? And that is just one of many.  if you have not seen this, wait for it on TV.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I first heard about this in the Film Industry 'rags' and as a guitar player/creative/artist etc. I had to have it.  I have been a Jimmy Page fan for a long time and I learned some stuff I never knew about him.  Before seeing this film I was not a (big) U2 fan, now I really get them and can really feel some of the songs that I didn't 'get' before.  As for Jack White, I think we will be hearing about him for a long time - although I doubt he will be a huge commercial hit because of the purist path he has chosen.  All and all this is the type of film that makes you sad when it ends because you want more.
B00319ECGU|4.0|Since the plot of these five movies has been discussed over and over again by other reviewers, I thought it best to comment on the transfers of this Blu-Ray collection.<br /><br />Let me start off by stating that these classic movies have never looked better. Each movie after Dirty Harry just keeps getting better and better in terms of sharpness, contrast, and color. Dirty Harry showed the most grain out of the five movies but it was minimal and only in certain scenes. Also, it's to be expected considering its age. It isn't until you watch Sudden Impact and The Dead Pool where the 1080P resolution really starts to show its magic.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're Dirty Harry fan, go out and buy this set. And when you do sit down to watch these classic detective movies, watch them all during a rainy weekend. Bad weather really brings out the grittiness that is Harry Calahan.<br /><br />By the way, the only reason I didn't give this amazing collection five stars is because of the way the discs were packaged. They are staggered in a way that makes it a bit difficult to remove, but not impossible. I may be picky here so you'll have to judge the packaging on your own.
0060853972|5.0|And I've read it about 10 times. Just as funny the 10th time.<br /><br />After reading this book for the first time, I read other novels by both authors, and didn't care for them. Not because they're not good, but they're not my kind of thing. You really do not have to be a fan of these authors to enjoy this book. Good Omens is  often stylistically compared to Douglas Adams, and I don't really care for his work either, so even if you don't like  Gaiman, Pratchett, or Adams, you could love this book as much as I do.<br /><br />How many books make you laugh before you even start reading them? My first laugh came in the cast of characters- the description of the demon Crowley. And how can you resist a novel that includes a  biker of the apocalypse who calls himself Things That Refuse To Work Properly Even After You've Given Them a Good Thumping?<br /><br />I won't rehash the plot here- I don't want to give away the many pleasures of this excellent book.

B003CR9BYE|5.0|Ask any serious Sinatra fan to \\"name your `Top 5' albums by your favorite singer\\" and \\"SINATRA/JOBIM\\" is almost certain to make their list. (In fact, it's `Number 6' on mine, and I own 70 Sinatra CDs!)<br /><br />This newly re-mastered CONCORD edition comprises TWO albums, plus some bonus tracks some of us had not heard before (at least not till recently -- on SiriuslySinatra satellite radio). The `previously unreleased' rarities include \\"SONG OF THE SABIA\\" and \\"BONITA.\\"<br /><br />Though it didn't merit a mention in the \\"Amazon Product Description,\\" close to half these wonderful songs were orchestrated/conducted by Brazil's Eumir Deodato, shortly before his own, instrumental, `solo' career really took off, (selling millions of albums in the early 70s as the acknowledged precursor of today's \\"soft jazz\\").<br /><br />[Like the other gifted arranger featured here, Polish-born Claus Ogerman, Eumir Deodato is alive & well (living in Rio) and still happily arranging for other artists. And for the record, Deodato will still tell you that his arrangement for Sinatra's `definitive' performance of \\"WAVE\\" (still my favorite track here) remains one of the `peak experiences' of his life.]<br /><br />A lyricist who wrote four of the songs here, Canadian-born Gene Lees died two weeks ago (April 22) at his home in California, (leaving behind an unfinished biography of his good friend Artie Shaw). Lees was `present at the creation' that magic night in 1967: He was there at Sinatra's invitation in the recording studio, holding his breath in silence, his heart brimming with joy, as Sinatra delivered \\"the definitive reading\\" of \\"QUIET NIGHTS OF QUIET STARS.\\" (Lees also co-wrote `Track 2' here, \\"DINDI,\\" as well as \\"SOMEONE TO LIGHT UP MY LIFE\\" and (my personal favorite of his up-tempo songs) \\"THIS HAPPY MADNESS.\\"<br /><br />There isn't a bad track here, though the duet of DESAFINADO (in which Sinatra and Jobim exchange the pleasantries of lovers) doesn't work quite so well: Perhaps the producers agreed? It might explain why this one (English sub-titled, \\"OFF KEY\\") had to wait 40 years to see the light of day on this \\"complete\\" collection of 20 songs.<br /><br />Gene Lees (82 when he left us) would likely have written his own appreciation for this beautifully-packaged set. Concerning one of his four songs here, `DINDI\\" (pronounced JIN-jee) Lees said that Sinatra's interpretation . . .<br /><br />\\"  . . . sends chills up my arms and back. Sinatra's reading [of Dindi] is one of the most exquisite things ever to come out of American popular music.\\"<br /><br />Lees wrote at the time that \\"arranger Claus Ogerman, who had been flown to Los Angeles from New York to write and conduct the arrangements, is [standing] ready. Brazilian drummer Dom um Romao, who had been flown out from Chicago to get a better bossa nova feeling than American drummers [were] capable of, touches his cymbals. They start.<br /><br />\\"The first song is \\"ONCE I LOVED.\\" They go through it, Sinatra not really getting into it properly. He sings well, but not with his usual depth of understanding. After a while, he consults with Ogerman and says into the microphone to producer Sonny Burke in the booth, `Let's go on. Let's do \\"QUIET NIGHTS.\\"<br /><br />\\"I tense up like a watchspring. I wrote this lyric and no singer has ever sung it absolutely accurately, a problem that bugged Jobim and me for five years . . . They start, and I barely breathe. As Jobim said, `This man is Mount Everest for a songwriter' [meaning] if Sinatra gets it right, we can quit worrying.<br /><br />\\"He does, and I realize that what I've heard about Sinatra's respect for the songwriter's intentions is quite correct. They do it again [on the second take] and raise the level even further, and at last they're satisfied.\\"<br /><br />[Later that same evening Sinatra will slip into the next recording studio and with a smaller group of musicians, record Something Stupid with his first-born, Nancy. Lees recalled]<br /><br />\\"As the date progresses, the atmosphere grows looser. By now the control booth is crowded . . . singer Keely Smith dropped by to listen.  Nancy Sinatra, much prettier and softer than she seems in photographs, comes in with several friends. She walks into the studio to see her father. He hugs her and grins. He has a warm rich smile. Then, they do another tune.\\"<br /><br />One last thought from the composer of \\"QUIET NIGHTS\\" - concerning Sinatra's take on DINDI:<br /><br />\\"It is filled with longing. It aches. Somewhere within him, Frank Sinatra aches. And that's fine. That's the way it's always been; the audience's pleasure derives from the artist's pain.\\"<br /><br />-- Gene Lees (1967)nger Keely Smith dropped by to listen.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|The Ear Force X41 is an amazing addition to any gaming experience. I am very happy with everything about them. The Dolby Surround sound makes gaming infinitely better. The chat system is so much better than any headset you can get for the Xbox 360. It has much more clarity, and it's easier to hear other people because you are listening through both ears. Not just one. The only con would be that if you don't invest in rechargeable batteries you will be putting a lot of money into batteries. These things like to eat batteries. But other than that i think the Ear Force X41 is an excellent product.

B001OQCV6A|1.0|The industry always drops the ball on this issue. They screen and give parental ratings on only 3 issues: Violence, language and sex, which is good. I would, were it within my purview to make changes in the industry, also screen for the Occult ( In this case, the worship of Satan.) There are many people out here who find things centered on the Occult offensive.    Now, if things that center on Satan worship and the occult don't bother you then I am sure you will find this movie very entertaining. I pulled out as soon as it became obvious what the central plot was: A Satan worshiper comes back from the dead after his execution and  resumes his sacrifices of fair, young virgins - HIGHLY OFFENSIVE.    I took it out and broke it to pieces after 5 minutes.

019280264X|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.d herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

B0000BYM3K|5.0|I haven't listened to it for a while, but I've played it many times in the several years I've owned it.  I've been a Maiden fan since 1986 and I'd probably have to rate them as my favorite band of all time.    My personal favorite songs on this album are Paschendale and Dance of Death.  Paschendale is about a WWI battle with the bloody death of trench warfare.  War & death, as any Maiden fan knows, is the most common theme found in their decades of song writing.    The song \\"Dance of Death\\" reminds me of \\"Number of the Beast\\" (again the song, not the album) in terms of theme, with Bruce singing of stumbling upon a magical ritual.    I see plenty of critics saying \\"It's not as good as their early work like Number of the Beast.\\"  I'd have to disagree, I own that CD as well, though I never play it, since other than the title track that's a classic no Maiden concert is performed without, the rest is pretty much forgettable.    Dance of Death is another fine album from one of the very few bands that has managed to thrive for decades.    As an aside, I'm eagerly awaiting \\"Final Frontier,\\" their new album to be released later this year.  Wonder if that will be their final album?  After all, by the time it's released, Bruce will be 52 and he's the youngest member.

Well well well, what a pleasant surprise.  Imaginative, expressive, happy, dynamic, skillful music beautifully executed and produced.  The disc is worth it for the girly chorus alone!  Sure you have to get past JK prancing around like a nonce in his pseudo Sitting Bull hat, but just focus on his delivery - masterful.  All in all a very fine performance  from a bunch of gifted musicians.  One for any music lovers' collection

B0039TD7PY|5.0|I pre-ordered this CD/DVD combo, and it arrived on its release date.  I'm a casual fan of James Taylor & Carole King's music, and have an album or two by each of them.  As a rule I don't like concert/music DVD's, and only ordered this set because the cost was about the same as buying a CD.  I am SO glad I did!  The DVD is a wonderful!<br /><br />The Troubadour is a small intimate venue, which was the perfect setting for two old friends to get together, tell a few short stories, and sing some favorite songs.  Carole King was glowing, and spent much of the concert seated at the piano.  James Taylor was predictably mellow.  They both sounded pretty darn good!<br /><br />The video seemed almost like it was a couple of guys with a camcorder - with fans' heads sometimes getting in the way, some shots where they were a bit late and maybe didn't catch what they were aiming for, & a few oddly chosen close-ups of the fans.  Those little imperfections, planned or otherwise, fit the mood of the concert quite nicely.<br /><br />There aren't any extras on the DVD.  James Taylor & Carole King  (mostly James) have a brief discussion (audio only while scenes of the club before the concert are shown) prior  to the actual concert footage.  It seemed that the DVD ended rather abruptly. Maybe that's because I was hoping for a bit of post-concert discussion.<br /><br />I listened to the CD, but not closely.  It seemed that all the audio from the DVD were on the CD except for the opening discussion.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|By the title you would think that this might be the last album for Asia based on their second album, 'Alpha'.  Hopefully not, but who knows these days.  Upon this release the group bands together and puts out some very solid rock songs.  The only thing I didn't like about their last release, 'Phoenix' was the fact that it sounded like a bunch of leftovers from their first three albums.  The two best tracks on that album were \\"Parallel Worlds\\" and \\"Sleeping Giant\\", both outstanding progressive pieces.  This album, while not straying too much from a rock oriented album still delivers and delivers much better than their previous.  Each song is a decent listen and I really don't think there is a clunker here.  If you did enjoy 'Phoenix' then this album will far surpass your listening pleasure.  The one negative I would have to say here is that it is a rock album and really doesn't venture too much into the progressive genre this time around which is sad, especially with the amount of talent that is present in this band.  I still like the album, but wished they would have delivered more progressive pieces to give it separation over sounding like a Wetton solo release, which it would have if Wetton had released this on his own.  That fact would have pushed it to the five star rating for me instead of four.  Still, a very worth while listen.  Best song so far, for me, \\"There was a Time\\".  Least favorite so far, for me, \\"I'm Still the Same\\".  Happy Listening!
0312370849|4.0|This well-written story of a true tragic event is almost too much to comprehend.  It is two stories entwined, with the Holocaust story being the more gripping, emotionally wrenching story.  The modern story of the journalist pales in comparison and seems contrived; hence, I only gave the book the four stars.  But the story of Sarah, whose whole young world was so senselessly destroyed by her own compatriots, is incredibly compelling.  Some of the scenes of the novel will stay with me for a long time.  I advise you to read this book only when you can give it your full attention and are prepared for an emotional journey.
1934356476|5.0|I've never written reviews on Amazon, but I felt I had to for this book. It's very elegantly written, as he takes the same format as the way one learns software craftsmanship in real life: solving real world problems under the guidance of a mentor.    In this scenario, you take the role of a new employee at a company guided by the Ruby expert named Bill, on a one week crash course journey though the object model, method creation, blocks, class internals, and finally putting this all together to write a piece of code that seem oddly familiar to the base files you see in some of the famous gems.    The book then goes on and ties this ruby knowledge to a Rails specific lens, examining the internals of ActiveRecord, taking a quick tour of Merb, and then having a glossary of metprogramming \\"spells\\" useful for everyday work.

Not only does it fully enclose the iPod and protect it, but you can take it off the armband and it can clip to your waistband or anywhere else you wanna put it. The click wheel is exposed which makes it easy to change songs to ones you want while running unlike the products with thick plastic over the wheel that most times don't register your touch. It doesn't jiggle while running and while the band may seem cumbersome, you don't feel like it's gonna fall off or slide down your arm.  Good Stuff here!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|I bought this DVD all excited to watch this phenominal movie at home.  What a disappointment.  The sound quality is slightly muffled and the picture quality is horrible.

I contacted Amazon to return it, but they said I have to pay a 20% restocking fee since I opened it.    Terrible.    AND...don't expect anything but the movie.  No special features....nothing.  Just the movie.    Save your money until whatever next edition they're putting out.   It seems like they threw this thing together to make another billion.   No Quality.
B002ZBTWL0|5.0|This is an excellent recording of a Verdi opera few people know. It was first performed at the MET only in 2010, the opera Riccardo Muti chose for his (overdue) house debut.  That production left a lot to be desired because of the strange, un-Verdian approaches of the director, costume designer, and set designer, but it was musically about as good as you can get these days and showed off the vigorous young Verdi.  This recording made some years ago is even better and highly recommended.  I don't much care for EMI's penny-pinching approach to notes and libretto: they are supplied on a \\"bonus\\" CD and you print them out yourself.  You won't be disappointed in the performance, I promise.

B00338T5RK|5.0|Got this from a friend just recently - had no idea that Slash was even coming out with a new cd.  I was pretty skeptical of it but then I got a look at who he was playing with on these songs.      I love it.      Definitely would have bought it on my own if I hadn't been given it as a gift.  I've probably listened to it about 20 times all the way through - and it's without a doubt my favorite current album to listen to.  The different artists - just make each song their own and the variety of them all is another huge plus - each song sounds different.  Sometimes you get an artist or a band that all of their songs sound the same - you can't tell one song from another - they all sound the same.  Definitely not the problem here.      Fergie rocks, hard to believe I'm saying that - but she really does.  I'm not a huge fan of Black Eyed Peas - not really in to their rap style music - but she blows the roof off of her songs.  Also love the new stuff with Ozzy, M. Shadows etc...  Out of the whole album there is only one song that I don't really care for - but one song out of a cd is minor.  I've bought cd's in the past where there was only one good song on the whole darn thing!  I think everyone has done that at one time or another!    If you like Guns N Roses, heck if you like great rock - this is definitely a great one to buy.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|As a Jane Austen fan I appreciate the interpretations of different producers and directors, and enjoy some efforts more than others.  In this particular case I believe Romola Garai to be the consummate Emma.  Time and again she expressed, most endearingly, the winsome innocence of Emmas confusion at plans gone awry.  When she finally awoke to her own heart I almost wanted to hug the TV!

B000AY74OG|1.0|I have no idea how this movie was a hit. Oh wait, because it is totally shamless, filled with endless pop culture references, and features overly cartoony animation.  Expressing how boring the movie would be hard. Nothing in the movie was funny, engaging, anything. It was just endless gags about \\"New York Giants,\\" and poor animation. Nobody will remember this movie in 10 years, no one. They will turning on \\"Finding Nemo,\\" \\"The Incredibles,\\" \\"Cars,\\" or even the recent \\"How To Train Your Dragon\\" instead. Unlike those movies, this one didn't try to have good story and characters, it just went for the lowest of the low. Only Happy Feet was more untolerable.

After being attacked by his psychotic pre-algebra teacher, he finds himself in a life or death race to the safety of a place called Camp Half-blood.  Once there he discovers this is a camp for children with a parent who is a Greek God and that he is a son of Poseidon.  With this realization, his luck goes from bad to worse.<br /><br />He barely has time to take it all in before he has to embark on a quest to save the world from an all out mythological war.

If he can make it through this alive, he might just save more than humanity.<br /><br />Mythology, heroes, and boy-meets-girl.  This book/movie/series has it all.<br /><br />I LOVED this story.  My son and I started reading The Lightning Thief together and then both found ourselves skipping ahead when the other couldn't be there to read it.  Rick Riordon did an amazing job of creating Percy's world.  The way he bounced myths and legends off of each other made me feel like I was coming home to a place I already knew.  It didn't take us long to read all five books in the series.<br /><br />The movie was an excellent adaptation of the first book.  Although there were many differences, I felt they did a good enough job that the differences were not disappointing.

B003BYYDXW|2.0|I'll hand it to him.  He's a talented singer with great potential.  However, he is much too young for most reviewers and doesn't really suit the general audience.  Like some reviewers have said, his target ages are the early teens.    Despite being young and lacking a nice picture on his album cover, Justin is a very talented kid who, I think, has great potential when he gets older.  I can't say I support him now but potentially in the future.
B0027JTI4Q|5.0|Luther Krank is fed up with all the hoopla of Christmas. He's tired of the corny office parties, the cold weather, the decorations that would only stay up for a few weeks, and most of all the money they spend on frivolous things. With his only daughter away for Christmas, all he wants to do is get away from it all. A nice relaxing week on a Caribbean cruise will be just the thing to take his mind off of the holidays. He thought the hardest part was going to be convincing his wife this was a good idea. Little did he know that Skipping Christmas was not going to be an easy task, especially if their neighbors have anything to say about it.<br /><br />Their neighbors have decided the Kranks lack of interest in the holiday is just plain selfish. They begin a campaign to get the couple back into the Christmas spirit. Whether they like it or not.<br /><br />When Luther is just hours away from winning, he's thrown for a loop when his daughter decides she's returning for a visit with her new fianc&eacute;. Now the Kranks must rely on the very people they have alienated the last month to help them bring the holiday spirit home. Not only do they learn the true meaning of Christmas, but they also learn the true meaning of friendship.<br /><br />Skipping Christmas is my all time favorite holiday book and one I read every year.<br /><br />John Grisham allows the reader to feel the haunting loss of a family member during one of the most important holidays of the year, while tickling the reader's funny bone with slapstick pranks pulled by both Luther and his neighbors. The battle over raising Frosty took on a life of its own. Since the release of the movie, Christmas with the Kranks, I've added watching it with my family as a new tradition. With Tim Allen playing Luther Krank, it has quickly become a favorite for the rest of my family, too. Allen's quirky humor definitely makes this movie one you don't want to miss.<br /><br />The book and the movie bring different experiences to the story, so definitely check them both out. I think you will find them BOTH irresistible.<br /><br />Reviewer: Tami Brothers<br />Rating(s): 5 Petit Fours, 1 Hot Tamale (tame but some sexual tension)<br />Petit Fours and Hot Tamales BlogI think you will find them BOTH irresistible.

B002ZCDR88|1.0|I'm surprised the record companies haven't figured out that they need to lower the price of CDs to stop the erosion of their business. This CD costs $20 at Borders brick and mortor. Here it is $15. I suppose her audience is older and may have the cash and the inclination to buy CDs. But really, I'd expect all CDs to hit the $9.99 level to match iTunes. For me, I can wait until this cools and get it at a reasonable rate.

B002QW7AJY|3.0|If you liked Event Horizon and you liked The Descent, there's a decent chance you're going to like this.    It has a bit more of a mystery, so it starts a little slow, but I think it's got great production value and direction. If you haven't checked out this director's previous flick \\"Antibodies\\", I'd also recommend that. (though it's subtitled, so be aware)    Got the Blu-Ray for under $10, so I can't complain.

0525421580|5.0|Once again I am not disappointed by the work of John Green. I love the idea for this book and I love how well two different authors can come together to make one great book.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Fantastic film and certainly not what I expected. Clint Eastwood dominates the screen like Darth Vader with COPD, growling his way through the movie. Since I don't want to spoil the story line and ending by talking too much, I'll just say that this film is definitely a masterpiece.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the best adaptation of Jane Eyre I've seen and I've seen the Hollywood version with Liam Neeson and the older version.  The actors are incredibly accurate even if this Mr. Rochester is a little too handsome. Some of the scenery may seem a little artificial but the performances more than make up for it.
B0013D8LOK|1.0|I'm the lone horse here since the other reviewers seem to think this movie was \\"all that\\".  But I've got to keep it real.  I've seen many adaptations of this story over the past 3 decades. However, this rendition just doesn't come together for me. I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp, musicals, and true crime. But this was just too dark and frightening but not in the way that the author intended. We live in a world of every day horror now (suicide bombers, the September 11th terrorist attack, Oklahoma City bombing, space shuttles blowing up, Columbine, mass murderers, serial killers, home invasion rapes and murders, child predators, etc., etc., etc.) I can remember being scared of the flying monkeys in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". I have yet to see\\"Psycho\\". And just 25 years ago, I couldn't even watch the intro to Michael Jackson's video \\"Thriller\\"! The world suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from the horrors of the past 15 years. Somehow, \\"a demon barber\\" and \\"meat pies\\" just don't quite push up the \\"Scare-O-Meter\\". Singing and dancing while slitting a person's throat may have been \\"That's Entertainment\\" in the 1970's but even \\"The Master Of Strange\\", Tim Burton, wasn't able to put a fresh spin on this story. The pros were the great acting by Depp, Alan Rickman, and Helena Bonham Carter and the lush production. Prolific talent just wasted in this dated effort.
B000KX0IOK|2.0|I kept waiting for the movie to start and if not start to mercifully end. The hopeless struggle of a weak man who faced the normal downs of life and could not handle them.  I did feel sorry for him and hoped he would find a way out. Ryan Gosling accurately and excellently portrayed a drug addicted teacher, resisted help from many sources and never seemed to realize help was being offered. Girlfriends, co-workers, his father and mother, the drug seller and of course the young inner city school girl.  The movie moved so slowly jumping form unrelated scene to unrelated scenes I only stayed awake praying he would not attack the young girl who both cared and had a crush on him. While nothing pointed to the POSSIBLE positive end of the man going straight and the school girl resisting the easy money of drugs sales, it is left for you to decide if he and she made it. This movie earned it honors only because it accurately portrayed the struggle and downward spiro drugs create and that is no NEW FLASH!
B000MXPE7O|2.0|This movie had more energy in the trailers and previews. Overall, the story was good but it just dragged out way too long. Matt Damon was superb as usual (makes you wonder how he and Ben Affleck ever ended up as friends!). Not much for Angelina Jolie to do here, except pout her already too-pouty lips - her role was horribly underwritten or, perhaps, better suited for a lesser voluptuous luminary. I got what the writer was trying to say. It just took too long to say it! Whenever the action (which was in short supply) lost my attention, I spent most of my time trying to figure out how does a person living in a house which appears to be in upper Northwest Washington, take a bus labeled \\"12th & Pennsylvania Ave\\", pass right by that stop which is technically the end of the line, travel several blocks south, cross over the Potomac River via the 14th St. Bridge towards Virginia (you can see the Jefferson Memorial on the right), then double back to mile to end up in McLean, VA at the CIA - WITHOUT EVER GETTING OFF OF THE BUS TO TRANSFER!! I was born and raised in DC back in the old days before the Metro subway system, riding buses all over town, so that bus route kinda bafflee me. Even if the CIA was housed someplace else back then, the 12th & Penn bus has NEVER passed the Jefferson Memorial! But, maybe that was the \\"undercover governmental covert routing\\" that the rest of the city knew nothing about! Seems like we are still being spoon-fed stuff like that fake-me-out \\"One step for mankind\\" studio video that NASA put out in the 60s!

B002CAWNDS|1.0|As much as I love Idris Elba, even he couldn't save this mish-mash. The director has no sense of what a psychological thriller is comprised of. The characters are shallow giving the viewer no idea into why they act the way they do. Why is Lisa so crazy and delusional? Why did she choose Derek out of every man at the firm? What wiles did Sharon use to &#34;gold dig&#34; her way into Derek's bed and life? Who knows?! Beyonc&eacute; is still not good enough to carry a movie alone. As I stated for &#34;Cadillac Records&#34;, diction training would be of benefit since her flat Texas accent always gets in her way. Usually an excellent actor, Idris overdoes every emotion here, which is the director's fault at not better defining the character.  Between them, Beyonce and Idris have the sexual chemistry of, well.....Beyonce and her husband, Jay-Z - i.e., NONE!!!  Another usually good actor, Jerry O'Connell has no real place at all here.  I kept asking myself why he was there. Ali Larter probably does the best with this weak script although she just comes off as a better looking Glenn Close in &#34;Fatal Attraction&#34;. Overall, I was very disappointed with this film.
1423113381|4.0|Going into this book I had very high expectations. After all, the Percy Jackson books are such a wonderful and unique offering in children's literature. They are funny, witty, filled with action and adventure, they breathe life into some of my favorite myths... They are hard to top. Pretty much this book is what would happen if the 39 Clues series and Percy Jackson books had a baby. There is alot more information being tossed out in this book than in Percy Jackson, but much more fun and mythology than the 39 Clues.<br /><br />In this first of the Kane Chronicles, Riordan again does a great job of combining humor with action and adventure. This book as a lot to explain in terms of the mythology it is based on, I think most readers on average know less about Egyptian mythology than Greek. However, Riordan again explains it in a way that brings it to life. And once all of the ground work is laid in terms of what is going on in the story everything zooms along at a really fun pace.<br /><br />Carter and Sadie Kane were raised separately after the sudden and tragic death of their mother. Carter has spent the last half dozen years traveling the world with his father, a noted Egyptologist. Living out of a suitcase and never staying in one place for long, Carter is quiet and a little socially awkward.  Sadie on the other hand was raised in London by her grandparents.  Even though she's the younger of the two she has a much  more forceful personality than her brother.  She is loud, wears combat boots and streaks her hair with crazy colors.  Carter and his father only are allowed to see Sadie twice a year.<br /><br />Carter and Sadie barely know each other when the actions of their father leave them on a crazy adventure with only a cat, named Muffin, to help them out. Not only is the crazy chaos god, Set, after them also an ancient group of wizards is tailing them across the world.<br /><br />Riordan again does a great job of pulling ancient mythology into the modern world. He really grounds his story and makes it believable. By the end of the book you really know the characters and are ready for their next adventure.<br /><br />Another fun thing about this book is that instead of having one narrator he allows Sadie and Carter to alternate every few chapters. Their voices are very different and how they see things is very interesting. It also sets up a lot of the humor.<br /><br />In spite of its size (its around 41 Chapters long) I think anyone who enjoyed the Percy Jackson books will find themselves loving this book as well.<br /><br />I'm only giving it 4 stars because it took me until maybe chapter 15 to really get into the book, there was so much information that it slowed down the narrative for me.d makes it believable.

B0017ANAZO|5.0|I have watched the original movie dozens of times, making it one of my favorite films. I thought this remake was excellent in its ability to adapt it to current lifestyles. As in both versions, one does not notice that there are no men in the film - and they are not missed! Meg Ryan was excellent as she was able to tone the overblown gestures and expressions used by Norma Shearer who never seemed to be able to distance herself from her old silent film days. (I always felt she got such juicy roles as this because she was married to MGM head Irving Thalberg. The 1939 film was over-budgeted, over-produced, and over-acted making for a campy movie to match Shearing's over-the-top style. Check out her version of \\"Marie Antoinette\\" [1938] - it so syrupy it'll give you diabetes!) Annette Bening's portrayal of Sylvia was superb as was Debra Messing. Eva Mendes totally captured the new millennium gold digger. Jada Pinkett Smith had the most difficult role as her character would have been the most scandalous and banned from the earlier film. These women were strong, intelligent, and independent in their own ways. Watching Meg Ryan come into her own was uplifting while Candace Bergen's revelations of a \\"life unfulfulled\\" was indicative of women of her era. All of the negative reviews here have no merit. This is well-written screenplay with an outstanding cast of women. Females watchers should learn to be open and supportive of a film with a female director and all female cast. Men can either take something positive from the film or not say anything negative at all since they obviously aren't able to understand the complex parts which make up a real woman of this time and this place. You go, Divas!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|Big TNG fan, was a great buy. Only thing I noticed was this item was new like I was lead 2 believe. It appeared someone had removed it disc and copied em.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Let me just say that I barely watch television anymore, but when I heard Ron Perlman was working on a show with FX (One of the only networks worth watching),I just had to see it. It turns out my enthusiasm was well justified. Not only is this shaping up to be the best show on the network, but it's probably the best show currently on TV full stop. Given the competition, that may seem like faint praise, but watch any episode and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.     The strongest part of the show (aside from some truly stellar acting) is definitely the writing. Each character is developed with their own unique traits and personal issues, all of which contribute equally to the overall story. With such a focus on the characters and their personal conflicts, you would think it would lead to an overload of tedious subplots and issues with storytelling coherance. The result is the exact opposite. Despite having a fair share of subplots, none of them feel tacked on or forced and they all contribute to the story as a whole, making for some of the most intricate, compelling and multi-layered plotting to ever hit TV.     I'm short on time, so I'll have to wrap this up, but just know that if you own a TV, you should be watching this show. It's smart, complex, dramatic, and full of edge of your seat intensity you won't want to miss. Kudos to FX on making one of the most intriguing, mature, and well thought out programs to hit the tube in years.

0307271862|3.0|A detective story about a massacre in a remote village in Swede. The man from Beijing is the person of interest, uncovered by the hero of the story, the female judge.    During the investigation, the story twisted into the history of the Chinese laborers in the construction of the trans-American railroad, the current development and revolutions in China, and power and ideological struggles among the Chinese elites.    Basically the description of China is more or less accurate, the story is a little dramatized, and some Chinese names are absurdly wrong -- Liu Xan is an impossible Chinese name, Liu Xian is a better solution, but overall, I enjoy reading this story.    This is an English translation from Swedish original.
B001IB63KQ|3.0|I really enjoy Paramore's three studio albums, so I listened to \\"The Final Riot!\\" to get a feel for the type of live group they are.  It was a bonus to get the DVD to see the live performances as well as to hear the band discuss the tour and themselves.  \\"The Final Riot!\\" was released on November 24th, 2008 and was the group's second live album, the first being the limited release of \\"Live in the UK\\" which was released at the start of 2008.    It is a difficult choice, but I would have to pick \\"Riot!\\" as the best of the first three albums from Paramore.  \\"All We Know\\" is a strong debut, but it has some weaker points, and \\"Brand New Eyes\\" has several of what I feel are their best songs, but it doesn't maintain such a high-level of quality on all of its tracks.  This is a very impressive album, all the more so when one considers that it is only their second.  It was released on June 12, 2007.    There are 15 tracks on the album, opening with \\"Born for This\\" and \\"That's What You Get\\" from their \\"Riot!\\" album.  Next up is \\"Here We Go Again\\" from the album \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" before returning to their second album for live versions of \\"Fences\\", \\"Crushcrushcrush\\", \\"Let The Flames Begin\\", and \\"When It Rains\\".  They then return to their first album for a nice version of \\"My Heart\\".  Next up is a new piece called \\"Decoy\\" which fits in well with their other pieces.  This is followed by \\"Pressure\\" from their first album, \\"For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic\\" and \\"We are Broken\\" from their second album.  Finally they finish with \\"Emergency\\" from their first album followed by \\"Hallellujah\\" and \\"Misery Business\\" from \\"Riot!\\".    Overall, the group sounds good live, and their performance is very high-energy.  On the other hand, putting out a live album based on two albums is a bit ambitious, even with the addition of a new piece (\\"Decoy\\") and the use of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" as a lead-in for their own song by that title.  Still, Paramore does a decent job of pullingit off.  My biggest problem with the album is that there are too many sing-a-long sections.  Most groups have the audience sing-a-long on one or maybe two pieces during a concert, but it happens on the majority of tracks on this album, though for very short periods.  While this undoubtedly works in concert and isn't much of an issue when watching the DVD, it is distracting when listening to the audio CD.    The DVD is definitely a nice add-on, and gives a good feeling for watching the group in concert.  I also enjoyed the documentary scenes, though I don't expect that I will watch that part of it much.  The tracks are taken from the group's concert in Chicago on August 12, 2008.  The band on this album is Haley Williams (lead vocals, keyboards), Josh Farro (lead guitar, backing vocals, bass guitar on \\"We Are Broken\\", Zac Farro (drums and percussion), Taylor York (rhythm guitar, glockenspiel on \\"We Are Broken\\"), and Jeremy Davis (bass guitar, percussion on \\"We Are Broken\\").  I'm rounding this one down to three stars, but it deserves three and a half.

I would only jump on the treadmill or elliptical just so I could maintain my same body weight but be able to eat whatever I felt like. I have never really had a weight \\"problem\\" but I was never super thin and toned.     I decided that I needed a change. I am 5'9 and when I started I weighed 155 pounds. I have been doing the Shred for about 3 months now and I am down to 143 pounds. I still eat out usually once a week. But I have taken quite a few recipes from her website to change my daily eating habits. It wasn't difficult to incorporate Jillian's food suggestions. That and adding in her 30 Day Shred workouts 5-6 times per week have really changed my life.     This particular work out changed my entire attitude of working out. After 2 weeks at level 1 I decided to try Level 2. I stayed at Level 2 for about 4 weeks. And now I've been at Level 3 for the last month. I enjoy the workout a lot and it really challenges me. It is hard and it kicks your butt but I feel like it really works!! My legs and arms look and feel toner and my stomach has tightened up a lot since I've started. And now that I've done this work out I recently ordered her other DVDs \\"Banish Fat\\" and \\"No More Trouble Zones\\". I've done Banish Fat twice now and I really love it. And i'm still waiting for trouble zones to arrive.     But I would never have moved onto these new workouts if it hadn't been for the shred. Once trying this work out you will become addicted to getting your work out \\"in\\" for the day. And since it's only about 25 minutes it's quick and you can push yourself through it. And I think Level 1 is great for Beginners because of the moderator moves they have. If you can't do the full-force moves Jillian provides a less difficult move until you're ready to move up to a new challenge.     She's also very motivating and she pushes you. I prefer her over the Barbie look alike aerobics instructors who are just too \\"peppy\\" and annoying. Jillian gets down to business and if you are just starting to get back into working out, I highly recommend this work out as well as the \\"banish fat boost metabolism\\". They are both terrific!!!       Thanks Jillian for making me WANT to workout. I never thought I would see the day!! =)

B001CTDH4Y|5.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Before seeing 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' I was expecting a completely insipid comedy strictly for ten year old's. Boy was I wrong. 'Chihuahua' is one of the best comedies I've seen in the last few years. It's got an 'A' story with a cast full of talking dogs and a 'B' story consisting of a supporting cast of humans. The star is 'Chloe', the cutest little Chihuahua you'll ever meet, expertly voiced by Drew Barrymore. Chloe is a prissy, pampered Beverly Hills doggie diva owned by a highly successful cosmetics CEO, 'Aunt Viv' (played by a still good-looking Jamie Lee Curtis). Aunt Viv's only sin is that she indulges her precious Chloe but is basically a very good person. That's evidenced by her warm treatment of the newly hired Hispanic landscaper, Sam (warmly played by Colombian actor, Manolo Cardona). Sam's Chihuahua, Papi (hilariously voiced by George Lopez) falls in love with Chloe and later figures in her rescue.<br /><br />Chloe's counterpart is Viv's niece, Rachel, who also needs to learn a few life's lessons by not talking down to people (Rachel assumes that the 'lowly gardener' Sam, can only speak Spanish). Meanwhile Chloe's uppity attitude is exposed from the very beginning. She's \\"born to shop, not fight\\"--and proudly proclaims she's an heiress; only to be met by one of her buddy's retorts: \\"a hairless\\". Chloe objects: \\"Not a hairless...I have a trust fund.\\" When Aunt Viv has to fly to Italy on a business trip, she leaves Chloe in Rachel's charge. Disaster strikes when Rachel impulsively drives down to Mexico with some of her friends and Chloe ends up getting 'dog napped' by criminals who hold dog fights in Mexico City. The head of the dog nappers is the nasty Vasquez who has an evil Doberman, El Diablo, (menacingly voiced by Ed James Olmos), who all the other dogs fear.<br /><br />Despite all her spunk, Chloe manages to remain out of touch even when she finds herself in the middle of a dog ring about to be chomped on by El Diablo. First off, she mistakes the applause of the seedy crowd as approval when in fact they're laughing at her, expecting her imminent demise. Chloe has some great lines though, inside the ring (\\"Clearly I'm not in the right place--call the concierge\\"; along with telling El Diablo that she knows a great dentist in Beverly Hills who can clean up his yellow teeth!). Chloe is saved by a former police dog, Delgado, a gutsy, world weary German Shepherd voiced by a perfect, gravely voiced Andy Garcia. I was in stitches when Delgado dumps Chloe in the muddy puddle of water and proclaims Delgado has got her scent--and she replies \\"Of course he does, it's Chanel #5\\".<br /><br />Rachel realizes the big mistake she's made and leaves her friends to find Chloe. There's a very funny scene when she gets a call from Aunt Viv at the police station and she has to pretend she's Chloe barking into the phone. Meanwhile, Chloe, now all muddied up, returns to her hotel and gets a taste of her own medicine: a bunch of snobby poodles want the horrible mutt immediately evicted from the premises. Chloe stares in horror at herself in the mirror and exclaims: \\"I'm hideous\\". Now she's beginning to realize that she's not so special.<br /><br />When Rachel meets up with Sam at the police station, the police only have limited information on the dog ring's whereabouts. Sam wants to wait for more information, but Rachel insists on continuing the search for Chloe on their own. Papi states he's with Rachel and utters the film's #1 iconic line: \\"We're Mexican, not Mexican't\\". Soon Chloe discovers the ever so cute con men, Rat and Iguana, and I almost fell out of my chair laughing when Chloe observes them fighting and exclaims: \\"This is just like Animal Planet\\"!!! Then when El Diablo confronts the rat after he pilfers Chloe's diamond collar, the rat has that great line: \\"Please don't eat me, I've got a wife and 300 kids to feed.\\"<br /><br />Wouldn't you know it but coyotes smuggle thedogs over the border! Eventually, Chloe and Delgado find themselves in the desert where Delgado reveals his dark secret: he's lost his sense of smell. Then our doggie heroes have their 'dark moment' when a bunch of mountain lions are about to have them for lunch. The film is just full of so many incredible surprises--there's a sandstorm, kicked up by a pack of Chihuahuas, led by the mighty Montezuma (aka Monte). It's Monte who gives Chloe a dose of 'Chihauhua pride' and the film's loftiest moment is when the Chihuahuas loudly proclaim: \\"No mas, no mas!\\" Rachel still needs to learn a lesson when she and Sam come upon some strays and she says with disdain: \\"Just what we need--stray dogs\\"; and it's Sam who wisely points out: \\"Papi was a stray dog\\".<br /><br />Things are neatly wrapped up when Chloe and Delgado aid in their own rescue by gaining the attention of a couple of Mexican Park Rangers. Soon, the evil Vasquez appears on the scene and snatches Chloe again (he's figured out that Chloe's owner is worth a lot of money). Delgado's arc is complete when he regains his sense of smell and leads the police to Vasquez, saving Chloe in the process.<br /><br />Both Chloe and Rachel have improved their lives after their great adventure. And they're both rewarded with true love along with their respective honeys (Papi and Sam). The further reward is that they get home just in time to prevent Aunt Viv from learning of Rachel's big faux pas.<br /><br />I don't know how Disney does it, but the direction of man's best friends in this film is superlative (undoubtedly some computer enhancement helped things along). 'Chihuahua' is not only funny but it's touching due to the underlying message of tolerance it so successfully conveys.lgado find themselves in the desert where Delgado reveals his dark secret: he's lost his sense of smell.

B002G1K82Q|1.0|the idea of coming up with a story to connect songs into a musical has potential, but the story felt forced. I can dig artistic movies, but this one didn't come across as artistic, but as trying to hard to be artsy.
1597801585|3.0|This is a well written book; the author has talent as he creates and defines this possible world of the future and the characters that inhabit it.  None of the characters in the book are likable, though, either because they are corrupt, dishonest, racist, simple-mindedly stupid, or just greedy; they have no redeeming qualities.  And the book itself is VERY depressing, with much suffering and death.  Nothing even remotely nice happens until page 300 or so, and then it only lasts a short time.  Some of the depressing mood is because of the state of the world in this future, but most of it is just the result of the unlikable characters and the situations the author puts them in.  While it was good to be reading fine writing, I couldn't wait for it to end so I could get on to something else.  The author is compared by others to several well regarded authors, but because of how depressing this story is, its just not in the same category as them.  Some characters need some tiny redeeming aspect and the story needs some possibility of a decent outcome, even if only hinted at, otherwise it just remains a long read thru an unpalatable future.

0811806405|5.0|I am an ukulele builder not a guitar builder. The book \\"guitarmaking  TRADITION AND TECHNOLOGY\\" was written with the guitar builder in mind. With this said, I found answers to a great many questions I had about ukulele building and basic wood concepts that I could not find in any of the books I have dedicated to ukulele design and construction. I found this book to be quite facinating reading and very useful to my needs as a woodworker and ukulele builder. I think someone dedicated to guitar building would be at a disadvantage if they did not have this book in their library.I HIGHLY recommend this book for the beginner or master guitar builder or just someone who wants to know what goes into the construction of a guitar. It helps you to understand why well built custom instuments are expensive and why they should be.JWS
B002VECM6S|5.0|I loved this movie so much and it was great to see another side of Sandra Bullock, but then again, I love every movie that she is in. It was a very touching story and it was much more interesting knowing that this was a true story.  It's worth the time to watch it.
B001T72DJE|5.0|I purchased this book to replace mine which has fallen apart.  My book has traveled to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, England as I have loaned it out.  It always came back, just more read than before.  This book has made a huge difference in my life and since my life touches others, it has improved their lives as well.  I know it has made a significant difference in each person who read it.
1423113381|5.0|I must say, when I read the Percy Jackson series, I instantly liked it.  I enjoyed the whole Greek Pantheon of ancient gods & goddesses, magic, etc.  So, naturally, I wanted to read \\"The Red Pyramid\\" to see if it had the same magic.  I can happily say that it does and then some.  I would even volunteer that I liked \\"The Red Pyramid\\" even more than the Percy Jackson books for several reasons.<br /><br />First, in \\"The Red Pyramid\\", we're introduced to two amazing lead characters who both share in the story's narration.  Carter Kane, age 14, is an African American teen who has lived with his father, Julius, his entire life...due to what is described as an ugly custody battle between Julius and his former in-laws (Julius' wife, mother to both Carter and Sadie Kane, died when the children were quite young).  Sadie Kane, age 12, looks caucasian (taking after their mother) with light skin, blue eyes, and hair she likes to put colored streaks throughout. Because of the custody agreement, Sadie lives in London year-round with her grandparents - seeing her brother and father only two times per year, which has resulted in the siblings being more like distant relatives to each other.  Julius is an archeologist, traveling around the world studying ancient Egyptian artifacts and bringing his son Carter along with him wherever he goes.  Carter, because of his father's teachings, is an awkward 14 year old boy, a bit hesitant and unsure of himself.  Sadie, on the other hand, despite being two years younger than Carter, is quite a bit more bold, quick to speak her mind and very sure of herself and her opinions.  I must say, I loved both Carter and Sadie Kane...for their differences as well as how they grow together as siblings! I cannot reveal much more than this without revealing too much of the book...but I think you'll know what I mean when you read \\"The Red Pyramid\\".<br /><br />Another reason I enjoyed this book is because of the depth of information given to the reader.  It's obvious that Riordan, in his research, learned quite a bit about the ancient Egyptian ways as well as the intricate nature of their belief system....and he definitely gets that information out to the reader in a very exciting and entertaining way.<br /><br />Magic and mythology come together in a fascinating and fast-paced way in this book.  Instantly, the action starts and you'll be pulled into the book.  Humor plays a big role in this book as well (especially from Sadie), which just adds to the entertainment.<br /><br />All in all, I'd highly recommend \\"The Red Pyramid\\".  If you're a fan of the Percy Jackson series, I'm sure you'll like it.  Or, perhaps you'll be like me and like it even more! :)dan, in his research, learned quite a bit about the ancient Egyptian ways as well as the intricate nature of their belief system....and he definitely gets that information out to the reader in a very exciting and entertaining way.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo9IS6RSS9R7NZ]][[ASIN:B002HJ9PTO Audio Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier Omnidirectional Condenser Microphone]]    I test the microphone on a Canon HF200 camcorder at the beach with both Ocean and Creek noise in the background. The difference is quite remarkable. Don't turn your speakers up too loud, as the volume changes quite a bit when I go from on board to lavalier microphone. Note that I had to actually LOWER the volume during edit because the Audio Technica mic would have clipped, otherwise.    During video editing I made the following adjustments:    Sound track +4db (to compensate for excessively quiet on board microphone)  Just the ATR3350 segment -3.4db (to compensate for the Audio Technica microphone being so loud)    Final analysis: If I was using JUST the lavalier microphone, no adjustments neccessary and it would have been right on the money. At $24 (today's price on Amazon) it's a no-brainer. If you have issues with volume narrating your videos and your camcorder has a microphone in port, go for it.    Note: This microphone is mono, so you'll need to correct it in edit (for me it was making left channel into both left and right. Very easy to do.)

B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is just a fantastic movie. I am not in to these types of \\"fantasy\\" movies, I actually bought this dvd for my fiance because he just couldn't wait to see it. Once we received it in the mail, we watched it right away. Let me tell you, this movie's special effects are phenomenal, the story line is great, I was interested from start to finish and there was never a dull moment.  Also, this would be a great movie to sit down and watch with your entire family. James Cameron really outdid himself on this one. I give it an A+ 100.  Two thumbs up for Avatar!  Also, after watching it, about a week ago, i saw this dvd for sale in other popular stores for more than I paid on Amazon.  Amazon so far, has proven to have the cheapest prices on the higher quality items, including newly released dvd's.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|If you don't know Dirty Harry then I'm not going to try to convince you about the series here. Some of Eastwood's best work as actor in all, and director for some of these films. Entertaining and thought provoking, and pretty violent. But big news here is the affordable alternative to the expensing package that was until a few months ago, available for $20 -$30 more. Great transfers and one disc of extras about the first classic of the series. This set made my day and if you're an Eastwood fan, it will you too!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|If you enjoy being manipulated and lied to so Al Gore can make money off you and then destroy America's economy further with his bogus carbon credit scheme to profit the elite and fund world government, then this cartoonish presentation is for you.   Just be sure to turn off all critical thinking skills before beginning. Forget that polar bears are some of the world's greatest hunter swimmers on earth up to 200+ miles, and then you'll be able to cry for the ever increasing numbers of polar bears when you see one on a little piece of ice.   Then ignore the fact Al Gore's been sued for all the lies this film contains and lost in court.   Don't ask if He left out the largest green house gas of all \\"water\\"  from his computer models that dwarfs CO2 by the billions because it wouldn't allow the results he wanted.   Then never Google Climate Gate to become aware of the 1000s of hacked /leaked emails from the IPCC (which is the origin of Al Gore's fairy tale information.) where they discuss and worry about how to \\"Hide the Decline\\" of the actual data and how to ruin legitimate scientist careers who were merely discussing the true records,and how the data was being cherry picked further proving global warming was a hoax. I say was because after the culprits involved where exposed they no longer use the term global warming but have shifted to \\"climate change\\" thinking you're too stupid to realize climate is ALWAYS changing. That's why they're called seasons.   A much better documentary would be The Great Global Warming Swindle. But I do find Al Gore's role in Fall of the Republic by Alex Jones much more revealing as to his \\"concern$\\" and it's free to watch online. If you're a Christian Genesis 8:22. Nuff said!
B000AMPZF8|3.0|I love Muse.  The Resistance is one of my favorite albums ever.  Origin of Symmetry, though, is probably their weakest album.  All of the music is loud, high-intensity and the album wears on the ear.  Their more recent stuff, which incorporates lots of textural changes, is much better to listen through.
0143038419|1.0|Liz Gilbert is on a journey all the way to her bank account!.. just one click away.. as you read (or get sucked into) her indulgent, clever by half tale ...spun out of self-love, glittering vices... and zero thought for the big picture of helping to make this world a better place.      If you're interested in connecting with other women to feel less alone in your time of struggle (we've all been there!), there are so many good books/memoirs out there by and about strong, interesting women (and men) that will truly enrich your heart, mind and body.      Here are just a few that have been on a spiritual journey we could look to for insight, wisdom, care for others, and compassion:  Jane Goodall, Mother Teresa (quoted in the review title), Wangari Maathai, Harriet Tubman, Eleanor Roosevelt..    I'm not sure if Liz Gilbert is giving her book proceeds to people/charities/causes that need it, but that sure would be right and good thing to do after spending an \\"all-about-Liz\\" year and writing such an \\"all-about-Liz\\" book.

B00006I53S|5.0|So this was the lens that came with my Rebel xTi about 2 years ago.  I sometimes hear that kit lenses aren't all that great, but this one quickly turned into my favorite lens for the portraits that I take.  It isn't ideal for the lowest of light settings, but I use my 50mm for that anyway, so it doesn't matter.  This lens is sharp, fast, and not heavy, in my opinion.  It's the best every-day lens for my needs, and I use it for everything unless I need my 50mm for something.  Unfortunately, my lens was just scratched really bad, so it's now having to be put away until I can afford to get it fixed :(  This is devastating to me and my business, but it will be one that I'm keeping, as it's definitely a lens worth having and not trading in or selling.  It's a keeper!
B00337KMAA|5.0|For each of the three feature films Jason Reitman has directed, he has consistently set the bar very high for the source material he willing to adapt.  While no source material will probably ever equal that which inspired [[ASIN:B000H0MKOC Thank You for Smoking]], Walter Kirn's [[ASIN:B0011187CU novel]] is at least in the same league.  While I'm not normally prone to lavish praise on George Clooney, after seeing his performance I would be hard pressed to cast another in the role of Ryan Bingham.  He is confident without being smug with a disarming charm mild enough to keep from raising undue suspicion.  And, curiously enough, he is genuinely careful to break the bad news to the soon-to-be-unemployed as painlessly as possible with their pride not only intact but even bolstered.<br /><br />The rising drama of the story comes when a very bright and even more ambitious young graduate proposes a means of completely streamlining the human element of what Ryan Bingham does in favor of a computer screen and a T-1 connection to the Internet.  It's difficult to say whether it is understandable or ironic that Bingham would take such offense to the notion, but he is certainly offended!  His punishment for not keeping that opionion to himself?  He gets to personally train the young woman who made the proposal for virtual firing.  At first, he is incredulous but he quickly realizes that this is really the best way to make his point and make it stick!<br /><br />The reason I so loved [[ASIN:B000H0MKO2 Thank You for Smoking]] was that it made NO apologies for what it was, an absolutely ruthless satire!  Unlike it or [[ASIN:B0014DFCMS Juno]], this at times tries a little too hard to not offend the sensibilities of a mainstream audience.  Great premise and great direction, but I do wish some of the same ruthlessness that marked Reitman's first two films was present here as well.  There should have been a menagerie of women with whom Ryan Bingham would cavort before he tried to make things work with one.  And the second to last scene should have been him looking at all of these other women and feeling even more distant from that opposite sex than ever.  That, for me at least, would have made the romantic elements of this story far less formulaic.<br /><br />But, all in all, this film deserved far more attention that it received.  It should have been a _real_ contender for best picture and not that mindless slop that Cameron was serving!

Now that the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is over, it has left a vacuum as far as fantasy films are concerned.<br /><br />This series (in which Sam \\"Spiderman\\" Raimi is a producer) effectively gives the fantasy genre new life and new blood.  Most of the actors are newcomers, but they are refreshing and convincing in their roles.  We have a wise wizard, a green hero, and a good witch as the central characters.  Together they journey on their quest to defeat the dark lord.<br /><br />With the \\"sword of truth\\" our hero \\"The Seeker\\" must defeat the dark lord who is repressing and enslaving the land and people.  This dark lord also killed the Seeker's father.  There is a prophecy that the Seeker will kill the dark lord and restore balance and harmony to the land.<br /><br />This series is done on a television budget, but also has a nice mix of special effects.<br /><br />* recommended viewing *
B002VECM6S|5.0|A different Sandra Bullock.  One clearly in command of her craft and well deserving of her Oscar.    This would be a terrific movie if it were fiction.  Since it is based on a true story and real people, it just adds that much more lustre to the movie.  Great performance and great casting.    Superb entertainment.  Satisfying entertainment.  Highly recommended.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|All I can say is WOW! Great CPU cooler for the money. I was having some trouble with temperatures, like sometimes hitting 70c+ under full load. After installing this heat-sink though, the temperatures are much better. I haven't seen it get over 55c.     I spent many hours pouring over newegg, tigerdirect, and forums discussing CPU coolers and after all that I am happy with the Hyper 212+. The cooling is fantastic for such an inexpensive heat-sink.     The install was a headache, but totally worth it in the end. The biggest problem I had was with mounting the backplate. I was trying my hardest to mount it upside-down. I wish I had seen the comment about the YouTube install video before hand.     I am using an ASUS P5NE-SLI motherboard in a Raidmax Smilodon case and it fits fine. The one hiccup came with the fact that the case has a fold out motherboard tray... the cooler hits the PSU when you try to fold it out.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Superb!  Definitely Sherlock Holmes with attitude.  True to the Doyle character, but much different than what you have seen protrayed before.  This is not your Grandfathers Sherlock Holmes.  Great Movie.
B0018CWESK|5.0|I love Dracula, Vampires, Werewolves, & Frankenstein movies.  But all of them in one movie is a BINGO winning formula and Van Helsing could have been the best horror movie ever; unfortunately it is more oriented to the action than to the Horror.  Still Van Helsing delivers entertaining for all fans of the classic monsters.  Kate Beckinsale & Hugh Jackman, are cool in their roles.  Personally, I've never liked the \\"Van Helsing\\" character in any movie, but this movie makes it for me more likeable.  I prefer the \\"Van Helsing\\" roll presented in \\"Dracula 2000\\" he fights and dies.  Maybe Bram Stoker's version is the best personification of the character, but I do not watch vampire movies to see Van Helsing killing them, as I said I prefer the vampires to kill Van Helsing like in \\"Dracula 2000\\".    Said that, I focused on the other characters, and I found the Werewolf and Dracula's Brides to be my favorite ones in this movie.  The Werewolf was suffered and believable.  But the Brides, they were astonishingly beautiful and horrific at the same time, excellent visual effects.  I wish they make a movie of the Brides only, with lots of gore and terror, something that Van Helsing lacked since is family oriented.  What I liked the most is the cinematography and the visual effects of the Wolf and Brides, they were superb as well as the soundtrack.    Maybe someone in the near future decides to make a new Van Helsing version for adult audience with intelligent and intense gore and horror.  All and all Van Helsing is visually very enjoyable; I recommend it for all classic monsters fans.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Much of what has been coming out of the film and television industries can be described as, at the very least, garbage aimed at minds who delight in gratuitous violence and sex.  \\"Amazing Grace\\" is not of that genre; rather, it is an informative, intelligent presentation of a past that should neither be forgotten nor repeated.  It is a portrayal of one man's courage in the face of derision and opposition from peers of lesser moral values. See it, not just watch it.  You'll be a better person for doing so.
B000FP2OPY|1.0|I bought season 1 when it came out and i thought it will be good. To my my surprise, it was not. It was only 1 episode named \\"Asylum\\" of the 22 episodes.<br /><br />I gave up watching this teeny bopper show after watching all the 21 poor episodes, which i think lacked, suspense, good story, acting and so on. If more episodes was like Asylum, i think it would've been better.<br /><br />I will not see a episode of this show anymore. I heard this show was influenced by The X-Files. I only thing that alike was them going around solving crimes and helping people. I think this show deserves my rating 1 out 5.
2839905809|5.0|Osterwalder and company have truly created a work of art with this book. The business model canvas is really an exciting and refreshing way to look at business models. The framework presented in this book is applicable to a wide variety of professionals. The small business owner and the fortune 500 executive will find the concepts in this book equally helpful.<br /><br />I highly recommend grabbing a copy. It's a great read and you will not be disappointed. Be careful though, your friends may try and steal it from you. It happened to me. (they have since ordered their own)
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I bought this series on Amazon, mainly because it was $40 cheaper then anything I could find on e-bay.<br />  I'm a Trekker so I'm bias. So I won't go into detail why I think this Trek series was one of the best of all the all TV Trek series.<br /> Ah, the item itself... beautifully packaged. The plastic containers that each of the 4 seasons comes in, looks like the old tricorder Bones McCoy or Spock use to sling over their shoulder when they would be part of a landing party. The disc themselves are in a deep blue DVD holder case opening like a book, with 5 \\"pages\\", one \\"page\\" to store each disc. A plastic sleeve slides over that to keep the DVD holder case from opening (like a book).<br />  There is a booklet with each season summarizing each episode.<br />This item will probably follow me throughout my life. Maybe becoming part of my future library.
B000024E9O|5.0|I have the original vinyl version of this album - but no turntable anymore. I haven't actually listened  to this all the way thru for probably 25 years. So finally buying the CD was fantastic - like renewing  an old friendship. Of course I remember the main songs - Carpet Crawlers, Counting Out Time,  Back in NY City etc. but what I forgot were all the wonderful interludes between songs - some of the  best guitar and keyboard rifs and solos happen in these spots. I think this is one of the all time best  \\"prog-rock\\" albums - right up there with \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" and \\"The Six Wives of Henry the Eighth\\".  A must have for any serious concept and rock music lover!

0307474712|4.0|Emma and Dexter meet on July 15, 1988, the last day of University in Edinburgh.  She is brainy, he is privileged and spoiled.  They are attracted but it is the Last day, and they are headed in different directions.  Their story then proceeds in yearly episodes, only taking place on July 15, from 1988 through 2007.  Nicholls adheres strictly to this original construct, filling in background as needed.      What is it about this novel and these two people that made me read straight through, despite its length, without once feeling a drag in plot or character?  I found it compulsively readable, believable.  Even though not much happens outside the connection between these two people and their occasionally divergent lives, their portrayals are so vivid, I found it hard to break away.  Dialogue snaps off the page, understandably because Nicholls is also writing the screenplay which is in development.  A wonderful addition to the genre of British novels of manners.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS AWESOME FILM _ THEY DONT REALLY MAKE LIKE THIS TYPE ANYMORE IN HOLLWOOD.  My background: I am an avid movie buff and will be returning to school to study film, I look to these types of films to educate myself in my filmmmaking pursuits.      El Cid was directed by the extremely talented visionary director Anthony Mann, he also did Fall of the Roman Empire; and the set pieces for that FORE movie were incredible, built from scratch under the direction of Samuel Bronsteen/ the producer.  This type of Director is seldom seen in Hollywood and underappreciated ( and actaully this film was not made in Hollywood, or the U.S.)-- Mr. Mann was a true \\"artist.\\" Too bad he didnt make more epic films.      In my opinion The only other visionary directors in the industry that are somewhat comparable today would be Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan but I really think Anthony Mann is actually in a seperate class of viisonary directors, along with Cecil B. Demille.  I should mention also John Boorman who I thnk is equal to Anthony Mann (having made the epic film EXCALIBUR)in telling quality stories--Boorman is an incredible director.      THE ACTORS :    Charton Heston gave an incredible performance as the Spaniard Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar, known as El Cid. And Sophia Loren also gives an incredible performance.  All the acting was stellar from beginning to end!    The DVD I purchased has extra features where you learn that in making the film they employed the advisory input from the most noted scholar in Spain at that time who specialized in this specific time period of the history of Spain; so the they tried to make it as an historically accurate reflection of the real events that took place- however they did base many parts of the movie on a famous poem/book written by a French author.      I only wish we had more directors and producers like Mann and Bronsteen still with us today - they left a filmmaking legacy that that is unforgettable and aweinspiring.I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS FILM FOR BOTH ENTERTAINMENT AND FOR ASPIRING STUDENTS OF FILM
B002ZTIILC|5.0|This album is amazing.  Like some other gems, the first time I played it through, it didn't really affect me.  But the more I listened to it...well, now I love it.  I can't really compare her to a similar artist, as my experiencing of various artists is small.  Her moxie and vocal bravado reminds me of Fleming & John, though.  The final track has a Jem or Feist vibe.  Anyways, I initially wondered why I was paying an import price for something I wasn't sure of.  But I'm glad I did.  Simply great.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|As much as I enjoyed the first season, this second season is leaps and bounds better!  The production quality in every aspect has improved, and the attention to the character development by the writing team and the talented actors would have to be it's greatest achievement!  With three episodes left to air at the time I'm buying this I KNOW the best is yet to come.  I can only imagine what this talented production team would be able to produce if allowed to continue for a third season.  This show has found it's rhythm in this season and it would be a shame if season 2 was the last season of DVDs I could buy;)

B0031RAOVY|4.0|I read about this movie on \\"Movieguide\\" (a Christian movie review site)  and it truly piqued my interest....I had never even remembered this movie being advertised when it was first released!<br /><br />The story is excellent (and a spin-off of the actual \\"true\\" story, that really happened many years ago in Japan)...what surprised me were the interviews with Richard Gere on making the movie, and his working with the dog trainers to make the story as real as possible, I found those interviews and stories fascinating.<br /><br />If this movie has piqued your interest as it did mine, you will NOT be disappointed in making this purchase.  I am looking forward to watching it again with my college-age daughter, (another dog lover) when she comes home this summer.
1934356476|5.0|This is the first technical book I have ever read written like this. I'm a author myself and this book has changed the way I think about writing articles, white papers and books. If you are just starting out in programming ruby or are a season veteran in ruby you need to pick up this book. The way it is written it is well put together and it makes you keep wanting to read more. This is not your normal technical boring go through the motions book. It's like a technical novel that is the best way to put it, I never met the author (hope to do so in the future to thank him) but sometimes when reading books all you need is one idea or 1 chapter or even one word to change the way you look at things. Paolo creates a setting like you just was hired at a new company and on Day one they want to implement a project in ruby, so a virtual character \\"Bill\\" your mentor your programming lead helps you along the way. I loved the postit notes and napkins he uses in a conference room to give you the skills you need to work on the project and it makes it realistic. I've read hundreds of books but this is the first tech book that has really made an impact in my career in terms of the way I think about writing, if more books were written like this tech books would be best sellers!!! Paolo Perrotta Thanks for writing Metaprogramming Ruby!
1582701709|3.0|This whole law of attraction business is what we have been teaching in witchcraft for thousands of years. But there is more to it then wishful thinking and keeping a positive outlook that the author tries to put out there. There is actually training that needs to be done in order to strengthen the will so that it has a greater ability to attract. You also need to learn how put clear messages out there and how to focus the mind so that those messages are effective. Now I am not saying these people on their own were not able to do that. Some people have a naturally strong will, some people are really good at focusing and concentrating. Others need a lot of practice and work to reprogram the way they look at the world. So I think that your average person will read this book and give up frustrated that it doesn't work or think it's full of crap. I think it's just beacuse it doesn't go far enough. There are much better books out there on the Magickal arts and how to achieve these things. The only problem is Magick can be a complicated system to learn and I feel the secret has tried to dumb it down for the masses. So in other words read it but don't stop there I would also recommend [[ASIN:0738709794 The Mystic Foundation: Understanding and Exploring the Magical Universe]] as well as [[ASIN:B001SR8BZK Practical Candleburning Rituals: Spells and Rituals for Every Purpose [PRAC CANDLEBURNING RITUALS]]]

0765322889|4.0|On an impulse I picked up Gardens of the moon off the shelf and when I read the first 100 odd pages I gave up initially. Unlike your typical book which gives a context and a setting for its characters this book starts mid plot and with a vast array of characters and puts you smack right in the middle of an entirely new world.  Luckily after a couple of months I started reading again from scratch - Characters started making more sense and suddenly after 200 odd pages I got really hooked - Plots and subplots were coming into focus with key character motivations coming in place. The most impressive aspect about this book and the series is that most characters are swathed in shades of gray - Complex and liable to switch sides depending on the necessity of the situation.      War and politics feature as key themes throughout the story with alliances being formed and then betrayed as easily on account hidden motivations and personal agendas. Power always comes at a cost with unintended consequences is often highlighted throughout the book - the scale and scope of the unintended consequences portrayed are often far reaching with Erikson going back and forth across different eras involving a multitude of characters to describe the effects of convergence in power.    Another common aspect of the book is you are suddenly shown sub plots featuring characters, which at first glance do not appear to have any relevance to the main plotline. However you can be rest assured that these characters have a major role to play in subsequent books in the series. Throughout the series there will be places where these characters and sub plots are brought together which left me stunned as to how those sub plots suddenly started to knit together.    As you come to the end of the book you will have a ton of unanswered questions - believe me it's a constant feature of all books in the series which I later found out. This book is just the beginning and what follows in the subsequent books thereafter has at left me in no doubt that this one of the best epic fantasy series written in recent times. However this book may not suit everyone with its complex plot, myriad set of characters, locations and eras and the most intriguing aspect being its unpredictability of its endings. My perception of who the main characters changed so often and so quickly that I finally came to the conclusion after reading eight books in this series is that reading with an open mind gives you the best chance of enjoying the twists and turns of this enthralling series.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|I enjoy all of the Jane Austen novels brought to the screen, and have all of these films in my DVD library.  This particular version of Emma is wonderful; each time I see a new version, I think it can't be better than the previous, but it is.  Do yourself a favor, buy this one.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Yes, he was walking alongside of Michael Moore. This film captures the pathos of our economic crisis and fearlessly questions the assumption that capitalism is what made America great. As a former economist, I already knew the lyrics to this song, but Moore played the tune that revealed the story's heart and soul, in the lives of the people who are living it. Of course there is exaggeration, there is dramatic posturing - this is a movie, isn't it? We use drama and various forms of verbal and visual rhetoric to tell a story, to inject it straight into our hearts and minds, if possible, and this film succeeds. From Flint, Michigan, the place of Mr. Moore's roots, to the rooftops of a drowned New Orleans, to the skyscrapers of Wall Street, we all bear witness to the history of rapacious greed and of deep despair. Then he takes us past the despair into hope and activism. At the end, he tells us, \\"Do something!\\" It's up to us to write the sequel, but I hope that Michael Moore films it for us.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Star Trek Enterprise is a great series looking back on it.  I remember when it first premiered, it started off a bt rocky but episodes got better, for the most part.  UInfortunately, I (among millions of others) fell out of viewer-ship for some reason and the show was cancelled.    Recently, I  rediscovered the show on HDNET.  It's broadcast in high-definition and without commercials.  The special effects are quite simply amazing in HD and it seems like an entirely new show to me.    Take a look at the show on HDNET before you buy this.  After watching it in HD, you may want to wait for it on BluRay.
B000000OTY|5.0|Any fans of Peter Gabriel will love this two-disc CD.  I have always felt that the true measure of a musician was his/her ability to perform live and Mr Gabriel lives up to it.

B000001FQQ|3.0|It was one of the most favourite albums when I firstly heard KISS catalogue on mp3. And I dreamt about getting it with better quality, than that. And what have I now??? A little bit better clearance of sound and no more!!! You may rise volume higher but you won't get what you want. It's not remastered version. But nostalgie of student era is so strong (I was 19 and KISS symbolized that period of my life), so I have what I have.
B000274THQ|3.0|It must help to be German of a certain age to appreciate what this film sets out to do. To write a farce-melodrama that's also about the impact of reunification on life in the former GDR is a bit more than this 2-hour film can bring off well for someone from somewhere else. There are moments of inspired brilliance, especially the home-made TV news broadcasts created to perpetuate the ruse that the GDR is not only still intact but has become the refuge of thousands fleeing the West. And that idea works on more than one level. It's a sitcom contrivance that also resonates with social and political significance, given the use of \\"news\\" to shape public opinion by portraying anything as something other than what it is, no matter how far-fetched.<br /><br />Finally there are too many ideas in the movie, which is not always a criticism I'd make, but when they operate on different levels of credibility, it's hard to know how much disbelief to suspend in some scenes. Irony may be the surer ground for working out narrative conflicts like this, but the film loses its footing when it has trouble being serious and comic at the same time. And as another reviewer has pointed out, the excesses of the GDR are an unacknowledged shadow in the background that complicates the more light-hearted intentions of the film. It's no waste of time, as some here have suggested, but don't expect to be swept away by its cleverness or insight either.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I only had a sample of the book sent to my Kindle and I couldn't even bring myself to finish it! I hate to think what the rest of the book is like.

I wouldn't recommend this rubbish to anyone.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Polanski is surprisingly sensitive in filming novels(Tess,Rosemary's Baby,Oliver Twist The Ghost);here he is, turning Shakespeare's drama Macbeth, into Polanski's Macbeth.Like a medieval sequel to Rosemary's Baby,it's filled with necromancy,murder,evil and witchcraft.Dark,dank,muddy and dangerous,filmed in appropriate locations(shot in Wales and Northumberland).The vision of a pagan,nihilistic universe full of death, revenge,superstition and prophecy.The mad ambition of Macbeth, galvanised by the witches and Lady Macbeth,sets him on his vaunting path from warrior virtue, as the Thane of Cawdor, to the murderer of Duncan, to become king.Polanski somehow guts the play(assisted by Tynan) of rhetoric(soliloquies filmed as thoughts),films an imagined blade as a real one,earths the verbal gymnastics in a kinetic narrative,so that pacing,momentum of set-pieces,rich visualization,fluent editing,create an atmosphere of dark nightmare and momentous terror.Gory,bloody,brutish and scary,this primeval world leaves nothing to the imagination,limbs lopped off,decapitations,the murder of McDuff's wife and children in their home,the ripping of babies from wombs is visualised,Banquo's ghost looks freshly murdered,Duncan is savagely stabbed while asleep.Weighed down by guilt and sleeplessness,Macbeth seeks out the witches for reassurance that he will not be defeated and to protect him from despair.     Distraught with guilt,Lady Macbeth walks(nakedly) and talks in her sleep,betraying the secret of Duncan's murder. The images of the film take the place of Shakespeare's language with spectacular realization and a modernist interpretation, using a rhythm and pacing that is Polanski's own,filmed as it was 2 years after the brutal murder of his wife Sharon Tate.This real experience bleeds into the raw and nasty feelings of dread.Jon Finch as Macbeth has a dark,lean energy and ferocity,Annis as Lady Macbeth,captures the fragility of madness rather than manipulative eroticism.Martin Shaw issuperb as Banquo.The ending suggests the whole cycle of betrayal and murder will begin again.Shakespeare,in making a sympathetic Banquo(legendary ancestor of the Stuart kings),intended some flattery to James I;the play also appealed to his well-known interest in witchcraft.The real star is Polanski for one of the best filmed Shakespeares ever.The witches coven is something else.
0061537969|4.0|Finished the novel \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" by Garth Stein is a quick read - I flew through it in 2 days.    The plot of this novel isn't all that unusual, but the point of view sure is. The entire story is told from a dog's point of view. I knew that before I started the book and wondered if it would be silly. It wasn't the least bit silly - it was refreshing, light, and funny. This book is a New York Times bestseller for a reason - it's very entertaining.    Considering how much I enjoyed the book, one thing I didn't care for was the racing angle. (It's auto racing, a \\"sport\\" I truly dislike.) Stein uses racing as a metaphor and considering that, and the fact that racing is described from the unlikely POV of a dog's, I still enjoyed the book.    Overall I'd recommend this book to dog lovers, racing fans, and anyone that wants an entertaining read.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|I stumbled onto the show by accident and it is probably one of the best \\"hidden gems\\" out there.  While it is a fantasy (they shoot the show in New Zeland so it has look of Lord of the Rings), the drama component is also very strong.  The initial 2 hour opening is incredible.    The cast is also very good.  Craig Horner and Bridget Regan to a fabulous job portraying the lead characters, Richard Cypher and Kahlan Amnel.  Their chemistry is seen in the first scene they are in together and only gets stronger as the show progresses.      Craig Horner does an perfect portrayal of a hero (or Seeker!) that is good kind but can wield his Sword of Truth with brutal precision.      Bridget Regan is totally amazing in her role as Kahlan Amnel.  She pulls off grace, kindness, wisdom and beauty while still showing us an exceptional strong woman.  As a Confessor, she is able to enslave anyone to her will and is adept at fighting with two dagger in a fight.      Bruce Spence as the Wizard Zeddicus Zul Zerander, is not new to the fantasy genre.  He often provides some of the comic relief in the show with his quick witty comments he provides.     Craig Parker plays Darken Rahl, the evil tyrant in the show that the Seeker is prophesied to kill.  He is highly charismatic and one of the best villains I have ever seen.    The show has something for everyone and I highly recommend it!  The second season is now winding up on TV and it continues from where this season left off.  If you end up liking this season, you will love Season 2!

B003CR9BYE|5.0|By 1967 Frank Sinatra was riding yet another wave of artistic and popular success. After career highs as a big band singer, a solo artist for Columbia, an innovative solo artist for Capitol and the founder of his own label, Reprise, Sinatra found commercial gold in 1966 with \\"Strangers in the Night\\" and \\"That's Life.\\" In 1967 he recorded both the chart-topping \\"Something Stupid\\" and this artistically rich album of bossa nova tunes. Pairing with Brazil's most popular musical exponent, Sinatra gave Antonio Carlos Jobim's originals (and three American songbook standards) the deft lyrical touch that marked the vocalist's best recordings. Jobim, in turn, gave Sinatra a hip outlet that was more sophisticated than reworking contemporary pop songs. Also contributing to the superb final results was arranger/conductor Claus Ogerman, whose charts gave Sinatra space to sing with a quiet ease.<br /><br />Sinatra sounds unusually relaxed in these sessions, swinging ever so lightly to Jobim's percussive finger-played acoustic guitar, and the moody strings, breezy woodwinds and muted horns of Ogerman's arrangements. The easy tempos give Sinatra a chance to explore Jobim's songs, hold notes and show off the textures of his voice. The recording and mix show off the brilliant results engineer Lee Herschberg accomplished in capturing the nuances of Sinatra's voice. Jobim adds vocal support with occasional alternating or duet lines, and provides both Brazilian flavor and contrast that highlight the incredible quality of Sinatra's tone. Three nighttime sessions yielded ten final tracks, which were released as the album [[ASIN:B000006OBR Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]], and climbed into the Top 20 on the album chart.<br /><br />Sinatra moved on to other projects, including an album with Duke Ellington ([[ASIN:B000002K9R Francis A. & Edward K.]]), a [[ASIN:B00002Z781 family Christmas album]], an album of pop and folk rock ([[ASIN:B002W9J5GW Cycles]]), and the triumphant [[ASIN:B0020H46ME My Way]]. But in 1969 he and Jobim returned to Western Recorders for three more nights to lay down ten more bossa nova styled tracks for an album tentatively titled Sinatra-Jobim. But two years later on, Jobim was writing more complex melodies that weren't as easy for Sinatra to vocalize, and new arranger Eumir Deodato's charts are more insistent than those Claus Ogerman scripted for the first album. Sinatra sounds rehearsed (which he was) rather than organically warmed up, and his vocals don't lay into the arrangements as effortlessly or seamlessly as before. Still, there's chemistry between Sinatra and Jobim, and though the former was particularly unhappy with his performances on \\"Bonita,\\" \\"Off Key (Desafinado)\\" and \\"The Song of the Sabia,\\" the project went ahead with its release plan.<br /><br />Sinatra-Jobim was finalized, cover art produced and a limited number of 8-track tape editions released to market before Sinatra killed the project. The 8-tracks that got into the wild have since become collectors' items. The seven tracks with which Sinatra was relatively happy were re-released in 1971 as side one of [[ASIN:B002N9MK9K Sinatra & Company]], two more (\\"Bonita\\" and \\"The Song of the Sabia\\") were later released on the 1977 Reprise compilation Portrait of Sinatra, and the 1977 Brazilian double-LP Sinatra-Jobim Sessions, and the third (\\"Off Key (Desafinado)\\") was finally released on 1995's epic [[ASIN:B00000DG1M The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings]]. Pulled together into a single 58-minute disc, it turns out Sinatra was right, the vocals from the second sessions, particularly the three delayed tracks, are not up to his standards. The stars simply didn't align for the 1969 sessions as they did two years earlier.<br /><br />The cool of \\"Girl From Ipanema,\\" the thoughtful regret and sadness of \\"How Insensitive,\\" and the percussive delicacy of \\"Baubles, Bangles and Beads\\" aren't matched by anything on the follow-up. Sinatra and Jobim were deeply in the pocket for their initial collaboration, and though \\"Don't Every Go Away\\" and \\"Wave\\" find them once again simpatico, Sinatra simply wasn't as deft the second time out. Concord's reissue includes the cover art (and unprocessed base photograph) of the aborted Sinatra-Jobim album, and a cropped, black-and-white version of the first album's cover photo. Veteran Warner Brothers/Reprise writer Stan Cornyn provides new liner notes in his typical riff-heavy, hyperbolic style, and Dan Hersch's 24-bit digital remastering sparkles. All that's really missing is Sinatra and Jobim's 1994 collaboration on \\"Fly Me to the Moon,\\" but that's a nit: the first album is gold, with or without extras.

0307463745|5.0|The reviews, book didn't have a synopsis, but bought the book based on the interesting title & the plug by Seth Godin (one of my favorite authors). This book changed my reality - personally & for my business. Book reads like a one-page summary of tips, advice for a particular topic. Really cutting edge ideas regarding conducting business in today's world. Awesome, reality-changing book. Am thinking about getting the other book, \\"Getting Real\\".
B00003CXB4|5.0|This was the third time I tried to get this item off of Amazon. The first two attempts resulted in the sellers not even sending the product and I had to file a claim each time. This seller was great. I ordered the item and asked for expedited shipping. I received the item in a timely manner. It was packaged well and in great condition. No complaints at all on this experience!!

B001HN69B8|4.0|If anything, Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is an imaginitive mess.  Featuring the final performance of Heath Ledger before his untimely death, as well as \\"tribute\\" performances from Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell; The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a visually stunning feast that sadly gets too bogged down in itself.  Christopher Plummer stars as the immortal title character, whose pact with Mr. Nick the Devil (Tom Waits) is culminating with Nick's taking of Doctor Parnassus' teen daughter (the gorgeous Lily Cole).  However, what no one seemed to count on is the appearance of the mysterious and charasmatic Tony (Ledger), claiming to have amnesia and quickly becoming the star of Parnassus' magical Imaginarium.  There are surprises abound with equal amounts of confusion as well, but what really makes The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus worthwhile are the performances of its cast, particularly Plummer and Waits.  Heath Ledger is deceptively charming as well in the role that he never got to finish, making it all the more disheartening that he was taken from us way too soon.  The guest performances from Depp, Law, and Farrell however are worthy enough to admire though, and Gilliam's keen imagination triumphs despite the film's shortcomings.  All in all, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is one of the better works of late from Terry Gilliam, and is worth seeing just for the fact that this is Heath Ledger's last hurrah.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|I came upon Spartacus the first time thinking that I was just going to see a '300' knock-off set in Ancient Rome. I thought it would be an entertaining way to kill some time, but nothing more. I was very wrong. The story is well told, the actors are committed, and a plethora of sex and violence that could have come across as gratuitous and unnecessary serves instead to buttress the underlying themes of Roman corruption, the desperation of the arena, and the very personal betrayals that Spartacus faces.     This show isn't trying for the historical accuracy of HBO's 'Rome' but instead is focusing on telling a fun and clever story. With strong performances, some stunning visuals, and a brutal approach to the subject matter...they have truly succeeded.     Unless you're exceptionally strait-laced about what kind of TV you watch, you should give Spartacus a chance. You won't regret it.
B000002H33|1.0|I'm listening now to some old 80's bands, and it's apparently obvious that most of these old groups had about the same talent level more or less, each putting out a few hits per album..       Many of the \\"heavy\\" bands of this time are signified by what would now be considered \\"power metal\\" with high, \\"untrained\\" or \\"adolescent\\" vocals. Things have changed up a bit now, and I'm not so sure for the better. Now it's basically not considered \\"heavy\\" unless someone sounds like they are screaming at Satan...      In any event, after a lot of listening to music, and a held-to-light comparison, I long ago realized my brother's garage band as sounding fairly patched-up. For example, the vocals and attitude sounded like filler: \\"hey! yeaaa! master of..naughty things!..yeea!,\\" errr, lol. Of course this didn't keep them from popularity. But like the bands that have improved on the tradition of Black Sabbath, the Sab remains most popular, and for all, due to simply being the first - no matter how old we realize it sounds now.            As for this album, though even its considered cool by mums and lil sisters, I still can't confess that I fully join them on the \\"like wagon.\\" There is some elements here and there I try hard to cling to, but not something I can't hear from any other band from the same time. I find myself skipping through most tracks and looking for my other music with more stirring grooves, more bass-ish aggression, more decadence, and more cohesiveness.     Sorry guys, I will have pass on this one.

B0011V7P0A|4.0|Early Petty is fantastic.  If there's one guy I thought would sound dated it's Petty.  The thing is...  It doesn't.  Simple and to-the-point.  Excellent songwriting.  Great classic rock staple.  I would've liked this more if Woman In Love were included.

B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Saw this in theaters with our kids.  We all loved the movie, Disney has found thier magic again.  I have read some of the critial reviews talking about the dark side to the film.  I remind everyone that many of Disney's classics have a dark side as well (Snow White, Black Cauldron, Sleeping Beauty, and more).  Overall the movie was delightful and fun, a lot of good teaching moments and laughs.

B003F3NDP8|2.0|I have been a dedicated Desperate Housewives fan since the beginning.   Seasons 1 through 4 were excellent.   Season five was okay.... now we are presented with a season full of recycled storylines (mysterious neighbor with checkered past moves in, things aren't what they seem).. yadda yadda yadda... I can't help but think the writers should have packed it up last season.   I have struggled to watch this on my DVR.   Every week I say \\"Okay, I'll catch up on all the episodes\\" and every week I try to and the show just isn't funny or entertaining any longer.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|No matter how great a movie is, releasing a bare bones DVD is pure greed and a rip off!!!  I'll wait for the inevitable special release.  Nah, on second thought I won't spend a red cent on any edition of this DVD because of of greedy executives insultingly releasing this bare bones rip off.  Studios, get a grip and face reality, soon everyone will stop going to movies and watch on-line!  Can you say pirated copy?  I'm always willing to pay for something I like, but this is just another way of screwing the public and I for one will not bend over.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|What girl does not grow up wishing to have a Cinderella ending to her life? This movie is much more than just your average \\"Cinderella\\" movie as it captures your inquisitive side and makes you day dream even more about your happy ending. The director did a good job in choosing Drew Barrymore as the leading lady. She does an absolute amazing job in captivating the audience. This movie by far is one of her best performances in my opinion. I recommend you watch this movie to revive your desire for your happily ever after.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|This was the first time I saw The Big Lebowski, so I was not attuned to the fine points of the re-release \\"Collector's Edition\\".  I just enjoyed the creative Coen brothers masterpiece of characters and vibrant yet dark and twisted plot.  The Big Lebowski is just a fantastic engaging steady stream of laughs.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges (the \\"Dude\\" Lebowski), John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Julianne Moore are the stars and unforgetable as they go on a journey of mistaken identity, White Russians, kidnapping, bowling championships, and the Los Angeles underworld.<br /><br />The Big Lewbowski is a hilarious comedy noir full of colorful bizarre characters.
1423113497|5.0|Although, I read many reviews saying the Percy Jackson series was amazing, I was still expecting a really young and childish book. I mean I did kind of steal the book from my 10 year old brother to read it first. Thankfully, I was wrong and ended up loving The Lightning Thief.    Percy Jackson is a 12 year old boy with ADHD and dyslexia. Labeled as a troublemaker who has gotten kicked out of so many schools, he never expected to be the son of one of the Greek Gods. It all starts when he kills his pre-algebra teacher and he starts suspecting something isn't right. Turns out there's a war going on between the Gods and Percy is the one suspected of stealing a treasured item. He must go on a quest to prove his heroism along with his best friend Grover and Annabeth, daughter of a rival God.    There was so much adventure and action. I didn't want to stop reading just so I could know what would happen next. All the Greek Mythology was interesting to read about. I learned some new things about the Gods and also of some other ones I hadn't heard of before. If what's in the book is accurate then it's an added bonus for younger kids to learn something new.    All the characters were wonderful. Percy did come off his age in the beginning, but towards the end he definitely had to grow up and it definitely showed. I also really liked Grover with his awkwardness and nerves. Annabeth is the wiser one of the three and dreams of being an architect.     The Lightning Thief was an exciting and fast-paced adventure which I think all ages will love. I can't wait to read the rest of the series and hopefully it just keeps getting better.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|Perfect Chemistry is a story that has been told hundreds of times. Rich girl falls for boy from the wrong side of the tracks and no one approves. Simone Elkeles managed to write her own original take on the star crossed lovers story and added much more to their characters that showed us what's beyond their stereotype image.    Brittany is the perfect, rich, blonde that all the girls envy and all the boys want. Alex is the bad boy who is in a gang and everyone fears. That's exactly how they both view each other, until they're forced to be chem partners. They get to know each other and realize they are nothing like the image they portray in school, or to their friends and family.    Brittany has a dysfunctional family. A father who is rarely home, a mother who wants to appear perfect, and a sister with cerebral palsy. Alex is in a gang to support his mother and two younger brothers. He wants to keep them away from harm and having to live the life Alex and his father did. Together, Brittany and Alex, come to understand each other and develop a relationship that people around them don't understand or approve of.    I thought the book was great, but there were a few things I didn't like. Of course, the story is really predictable since we've heard and seen it many times before. I was annoyed with the way Alex talked that it made me cringe, a lot, every time I'd read from his perspective. It just seemed very cliché of a Mexican gang banger, which he was, but still it was annoying.    It was still a great book and Simone Elkeles is a wonderful writer. I can't wait to read her other books, which I'm sure are just as enjoyable as Perfect Chemistry.
B00006RINF|3.0|Skirts a mediocrity so many similar acts evoke by accentuating the vocals to aid occasionally powerful gestures.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|I saw the Sticky & Sweet Tour in Boston & my friend let me listen to it over his cell phone when he saw it in Atlanta. This DV D lived up to my expectations. It's wonderful. Great music, dancing, staging & costumes. The backstage footage is great, though I wish it was a little longer. I was surprised how they left out Britney's rehearsal, since they had all the other guest appearances rehearsing with Madonna This is a wonderful DVD. Let's hope & pray that they eventually come out with the Re-Invention Tour on DVD.
B0018Q0PXW|4.0|For Westerners, especially Americans, this book is a primer on Middle Eastern discontent. It is not a story rooted in religious delusion, but rather cultural incompatibility.   This soliloquy (in the first person) expands on the life of a disaffected immigrant, in his final disassociation with America.  Unless the reader was raised in the US, this story may disappoint or puzzle many. But in today's content (attempted bombings and retaliations), it is prescient.  A joy to read and a must have for anyone who seeks understanding.
B0033AGPEE|2.0|This is average at best. Definitely not among Jimi's best material. It feels like he is just going through the motions. There is really no cohesiveness to this presentation, and I found myself wanting to go back and hear some of his earlier material which has a lot more emotion and power than anything on this bland offering.
B00004THAY|5.0|Over the past couple of years I have spent a fair amount of time reviewing various blues artists who \\"spoke\\" to me when I first got interested in the folksy county blues of the likes of Son House and Skip James back in the folk revival days of the early 1960s and then the steamy city blues of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Now those last named two came out of the country, the Mississippi delta cotton country, but when they went north to Chicago and got some electricity they transformed themselves and the genre. No question.     The blues, especially the country blues got a great impetus from the folk revival of the early 1960s, as the country blues of Son and Skip along with Mississippi John Hurt got more play from young, mainly Northern urban folkies who \\"discovered\\" them. The real impetus behind the \\"discovery\\" of the likes of Muddy and Wolf, as well as one of the two artists under review here, B.B. King, was the \\"British invasion\\". While we teenagers on this side of the Atlantic were hung up with Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, and rightly so, the \\"lads\\" in England like The Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and the other artist featured here, Eric Clapton, were trying to get every blues record, urban electric or country, they could lay their hands on.     Thus it seems fitting, in a way, that B.B. King and Eric Clapton, clearly two ambassadors for the blues should team up and let it rip through some of the classics of the genre. Now I have a confession to make, although I have spilled much ink in this space on many old time blues artists, some well known, others strictly for aficionados, I have not mentioned B.B. King, except in passing. This is strictly a matter of personal preference. B.B. and his ever present \\"Lucille\\", with the exception of a few early numbers, never really \\"spoke\\" to me like Howlin' Wolf, for one, did.     No question that B.B. is a master on the guitar, no question that he is a great bluesman in the old fashion sense and no question that when he teams up with Clapton here they \\"smoke\\" on some of the songs but that is the story on the \\"King\\" and me. So that only leaves what is good here. Well, certainly the title track, \\"Riding With The King\\", the country blues classic, \\"Keys To The Highway\\", \\"Worried Life Blues\\", and \\"I Wanna Be\\". Those will keep you jumpin'.
B0036TGSVM|5.0|The five stars is for what we might this year be able to buy, if Disney does the right thing by us.  It's the Disney organisation's chance to correct recent film history and bring out the classic Fantasia in its original, uncensored version including the scene with the young black Centaurette servant-girl (yes, it's offensive but is a frozen moment in history which serves to remind people how an entire race was stereotyped in the past) and the very innocent 'topless' nudity in some other sequences.   I find Fantasia a mixed-bag. There are some sequences such as the dancing hippos which I totally detest. But then there are sequences of unbelievable brilliance, as in the animation accompanying the excerpts from Tchaikovsky's 'Nutcracker'. And there is the inspired conducting of Leopold Stokowski, who I was lucky enough to see live in concert in London's Albert Hall one great evening. My animation heaven is peopled largely by the Warners Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies crew ... but Walt did come up trumps with Fantasia. Now give us the Blu ray version history deserves.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|The key to understanding Tarantino is that he rarely, if ever, has an original bone in his body when he's having fun.  In Kill Bill he uses a great deal of Ennio Morricone music, why? Because he likes his music.  He could have just as easily had a composer write something new for him, but having done original and great films like Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, he became a little more relaxed.  Grindhouse was made by both him and Rodriguez because they wanted to homage all of the horror type movies they enjoy.  Death Proof is Tarantino without the effort to be serious, he is simply having a good time.  He does throw backs to some of his movies and references dozens of his personal favorites.  I for one, am pleased to see that a director can simply have a fun time doing what he loves to do, the film people don't always have to be so hardcore and intense with their work, they deserve a break.  Having said that, I will admit I have a sort of bias to Death Proof, mainly b/c I like horror movies a lot, and I enjoy a really good car chase or two, and in all honesty who doesn't.  This movie is NOT a high point in Tarantino's career as a writer and director, but it is still enjoyable.  You have a bunch of hot babes who can deliver their lines well and with guts, you have Kurt Russell enjoying himself to an almost disturbing degree, you have Tarantino's trademark dialogue, you have rough scratches on the screen to emulate classic grindhouse flicks, you have camerawork and set design that references the color schemes and techniques of Argento and de Palma, and you have one of the most intense, enjoyable, exciting, and awesome car chases in recent years.  Not since Ronin have I been more sweat-covered and in awe at what can be done with REAL STUNTS AND REAL CARS as opposed to flashy CGI.  DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT take this film SERIOUSLY, just kick back and enjoy it.

1435248244|4.0|Scott Westerfeld's Uglies is a fantastic book. I know it's an older series but I hadn't read it and after I enjoyed Leviathan so much, I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />As in Leviathan, Westerfeld shines when he's creating an alternate reality. In Uglies he throws us into a dystopian world where anyone that isn't literally perfect is considered hideous and shunned to live a life isolated from the freewheeling hyper-advanced \\"New Pretty Town\\" - until their 16th birthday transforms them into the picture of perfection.<br /> Hmmm...Too skinny! Throw her in with the leper and the guy with the hunchback<br /><br />Tally Youngblood, an Ugly three months away from her operation, is a likable character - spirited, crafty, and kind - but the quality that really stands out like a sore thumb that constantly pokes you in the eye to remind you it's there is her obsession. It is REALLY annoying.<br /><br />Every few minutes Tally likes to remind us how she can't wait to be Pretty, or she points out the flaws of every Ugly she sees in excruciating detail.<br /><br />I understand that living in that world with nothing to look forward to except your prettifying 16th B-day could cause mental ailment, and this is her character flaw that she must overcome, but that doesn't make me want to hog-tie and gag her insecure thoughts any less. I got it after the first 100 times she went on and on and on about it.<br /><br />Unfortunately her new friend Shay (who has the same birthday as Tally) runs off just before their operation talking about about a secret organization called \\"Smoke\\" where nobody is Pretty and lives without the comforts and oppressions of the city. Shay tries to convince Tally to come with her but she refuses and Shay leaves her cryptic directions just in case she changes her mind.<br /><br />Tally is refused her operation by the mysterious \\"Special Circumstances,\\" and must choose between betraying her friend or becoming Pretty (which as you may remember is her only conscious thought...occasionally...just behind breathing).<br /><br />The technology is one of the highlights. Our heroine's (and everyone else outside of the cities) main mode of transportation is by way of hoverboard. Hover technology keeps everything upright and stable. Almost everything is solar powered or self-sustaining in some way and any kind of unnecessary overuse of resources has been banned. I loved this futuristic feel because while it wasn't so advanced that it seemed completely out of touch.<br /><br />I liked the way Westerfeld took good things about out society - conservation efforts - and had us develop them in a positive way. But then he took our obsession with youth, physical beauty and aesthetic perfection and evolved it way into the negative.<br /><br />The characters are realistic and have plenty of depth - no faceless mannequins whose only purpose is to be a blank canvas for the reader to project themselves upon. But again, Westerfeld's writing is excellent.<br /><br />Uglies is good for younger or older teens as there is no sex, language or violence to be concerned about. It's thought provoking about how much emphasis we put on looking good. Sure it has a message but it doesn't bog the story down.<br /><br />Uglies is beautiful entertainment!<br /><br />Cover: It's uh...it's colorful? I don't know, I'm not crazy about it. It doesn't really give me a clue as to what the book is about.<br /><br />First Line(s): The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.<br /><br />So...probably not the most appealing, but its got some definite shock value. You almost do a double take. It grabs you, just...not in a good way.<br /><br />Review by Jake Kirkeathing).    The technology is one of the highlights.

0307454541|1.0|I can't imagine a more boring read than this book. I only stuck with it because it was highly recommended by someone with a college edumacation. While I am not among the most scholarly people on the planet, I do know what is a poor excuse for literature. And The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is just that.

The music is not from the DVD This is It. It contains the songs that were meant to be used on his tour. Great quality sound. A must have for any Michael Jackson fan.

0470477237|5.0|In Socialnomics, Erik Qualman demonstrates the breadth of social media and the tremendous impact it has made on society in a short period of time.<br /><br />Qualman provides precise examples of how social media is shifting our media consumption, impacting our lives, and the potential it has to help businesses grow like never before. He also shows how social media can backfire and harm your reputation if not utilized properly.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any individual who uses social media, but doesn't quite understand its true purpose and value. For anyone who thinks Twitter is a waste of time, that Facebook is pointless, and that social media is just a fad. Socialnomics teaches us the very opposite, illustrating how social media can save us time, help us make better-informed decisions, and connect us with people and solutions faster than ever before.<br /><br />Socialnomics is a must-read for anyone looking to make sense of the social media landscape and use these online tools to help build their brand.
B003E8AF5U|3.0|I'm pretty sure this album just goes to show that MGMT are really out to please no body but themselves. Good for them. As artists, they're doing what they want, and a change in style is generally a good thing when it comes to artistic expansion.    To everyone that seems personally offended that this album doesn't sound exactly like OS, remember that they didn't write the album for you. You're just one of the sheep that bought it.
B000002HJD|5.0|I have heard this album before but never came to purchase it until now.  This shows the poetic side of Morrison and offers many songs in a different prospective, almost portraying the origin of many of the Doors classic songs.      For the true Doors fan it is a must have plain and simple.  A MUST OWN, I recommend buying the CD and if you want rip it to your computer as I did for use on an MP3 player.  A MUST HAVE!!!
1400052173|5.0|I had never heard of HeLa cells before reading this book. I feels a little embarrassed by that fact since I'm a 35yr retired RN. But, who knows everything? I learned so much from reading this story.  I have to say it is one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read. Not only did the book present a wealth of information about medical science years ago, but it makes one appreciate where we are today.  In my career I've witnessed patients signing operative consents many times.  I never gave it much thought as I quickly resumed many other duties. It was fascinating to read that once organs, cells.etc are removed from your body they no longer belong to you and the doctor may do as he sees fit.  The key is getting the CONSENT TO OPERATE. The consent and related details no longer apply once the product is removed from the body. A patient would have had to specify in writing what he/she wants done with same prior to the procedure,i.e organ donation. That was true in 1951 and remains true in 2010.  That's just one example of what I was enlightened about in this book.  I felt so sorry for Deborah who was ignorant of so much.  However, I was impressed by her unfailing devotion to her mother as well as her never ending determination to educate herself to as what had happened to her mother and all the ramifications. Tragic as the story was I had to laugh at some of Deborah's misconceptions, comparisons and sweeping generalizations.  It was very poignant how the author was exceeding patient and developed a close relationship with Deborah and her family. I felt that she genuinely liked them and was not merely putting on an act to get the facts and write a good story.  I highly recommend this book to anyone whether you've have heard of HeLa cells or not.  There is so much to learn about the ravishing disease of Cancer.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|The adventures that this one includes is A Scandal in Bohemia, The Red-Headed League, A Case of Identity, The Boscombe Valley Mystery, The Five Orange Pips, The Man with the Twisted Lip, The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle, The Adventure of the Speckled Band, The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb, The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor, The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, and The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. The flow of it was easy to follow and even being in the dark and coming into a story midstride sometimes was well thought through. You don't feel bogged down with too many details, nor do you feel left out of some. At first I didn't like not getting some descriptions before hand, but I know including them would only have cluttered the writing with too many details.    I loved these short stories. It was awesome to read the mystery to which Sherlock needed to solve and see his mannerisms. Then, out of absolutely nothing it seemed he had solved it! I loved how the story included through Sherlock on how he solved cases. Noticing the little things was mostly how he did it and I found myself trying to use those same tricks as best I could from reading to figure things out. It was a fun and awesome read.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Based on the reviews by others here, I bought this DVD as part of a birthday gift for my wife.  She had never heard of Little Dorrit, so when she opened it she was somewhat reserved in her appreciation.  After viewing this rendition, she is ecstatic to have been given it.  We started watching it one night, and had to force ourselves to stop.  After that we restricted ourselves to 3 episodes per evening, so that we would not stay up too late watching. The acting is superb, the costumes are great, and despite what others have said, we had no problem understanding the actors (and we are from the Midwest).  I did not care for  Matthew Macfadyen in Pride and Prejudice (he seemed confused in the role), but he acquitted himself admirably in this series.  The humor, the tragedy, the plot twists, and the irony were interwoven so well as to keep ones interest piqued at all times.  The subtlety of the actual fall of the house of Clennam when the dark secrets were revealed at the end that had threatened to \\"bring down the House of Clennam\\" was a stitch!  We will be watching this again very soon, so that we can pick up on some nuances that were missed the first time through.  The 452 minutes the program runs sounds intimidating, but I would not shorten it by a minute; in fact it could be longer- its that good!
B003G4W49C|5.0|My SGT loaned this book to me, told me nothing about it, only made me PROMISE to read it before I started any other books (I read constantly), so this was a big deal to me).

B001CDWFPC|5.0|I travel frequently and to carry this large ESV Study Bible around was very difficult due to its size and weight.  I am very happy to have it on my Kindle.  It took me a while to get around it, but now I am more comfortable.  It was also helpful to read the other reviews and the advice on how to find my way around.  The print on my Study bible was too small and I could only read for a short time-after only a half hour I would get eye strain.  With my Kindle and ability to make the print larger, I can study for longer periods.  I like the clarity and the size of the screen.  I highly recommend the Kindle DX for anyone who is visually impaired.
B002Y0KR7U|5.0|First things first: this is not a fast paced war movie. There is little action and the majority of the film is dialog. If youre looking for a bluray war movie to show off your sound system, this is definitely not it.    Having said that, this is was a very interesting, to me, movie. It focuses on 2 young snipers during the first gulf war. The movie depicts the tensions, anxiety, courage and patriotism (or lack thereof) in young, intelligent pair of soldiers during the first major US conflict/war in almost 2 decades. I dont want to give too much away, but would like to say that the movie itself is beautiful (as beautiful as shots of the desert can be). The writing is spot on and it exemplifies rather well the feeling of the first gulf war.     This is similar to Generation Kill, but like i said, there isnt much action. I would recommend it to intelligent people interested in seeing war from the soldier's point of view, not Micheal Bay's
1416550534|5.0|First of all, let me say that if you are a fan of supermarket thrillers, The House at Riverton will not be your cup of tea.  There are no clever serial killers, no space aliens nor any rehydrated Nazis bent on world domination.     As others have said, this is a character driven story set against a backdrop of changing values in a changing society.  While we may value all the technological advances in today's society, how many of us, often lament the tradeoffs that progress demands.     On a personal note, what resonated with me was that my grandmother also worked in service during the same time as does the fictional Grace.  During those years, there was no welfare or WIC.  If one was born into poverty, going into service and working long hours for the aristocrats was what kept you from starving to death. Reading The House at Riverton was like listening to my grandmother retelling her tales of a not too distant past.     Yes, there are minor inaccuracies in the book and sometimes the writing is a bit contrived but this is my genre and I loved the book.     Finally, this is a book that you can give to your mother-in-law as the author has mercifully and tactfully spared us any graphic sex scenes.
0743454537|4.0|Although I am an avid book reader, this is the first time I've read anything by Jodi Picoult.  \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is interesting, for lack of a more fitting adjective.  I find myself, having finished the novel 10 minutes ago, feeling a bit ambiguous about the novel-as a whole.  In my ambiguity, I decided to read some of the other reviews, with the hopes that I would gain some clarity about what I am feeling....that didn't work!!!!    NO SPOILER ALERT!! THIS REVIEW IS NOT GOING TO RUIN IT FOR ANYONE!!!    The book is about a man and a woman who, in the efforts to save a dying child, have a \\"designer baby\\".      THIS, OFF THE BREAK, IS A PROBLEM!!     However, once you get past that purely \\"unnatural\\" thing, the book is an ok read. The book tells a story about a \\"designer baby\\" who become a teen and decides (at age 13) that she is sick and tried of being sick and tired...all to help a sibling who is literally sick and really tired.    Picoult does a good job and painting a picture of the characters for the reader.  For the most part, she does a good job at telling the story from a neutral perspective.  I disagree with many of the reviews I've read prior to writing this one.  It is a very sensitive issue, and I was impressed with Picoult's ability to write it a way which allowed me to form my own opinion about whether or not the healthy child should have the right to choose what to do with her body.  The author actively shared perspectives from the parents, the children and all other parties involved. I think it was impressive, how Picoult was able to pen such a compelling novel about such a sensitive topic without me knowing what she (author) felt about it all.  Although I have read the end, I still don't know what Picoult's position is on the matter....that fascinates me!!! Well Done...Kudos To Picoult!!    On the flip side, I knew enough, had read enough, and saw the picture clearly enough, to form my opinion half way through the book.  The book was tooooo long and drawn out.  On average, the books I read are 400 pgs.  I read some really good books.  This book was tooo long for its own good. It seems to take me FOREVER to finish it because there was A LOT OF EXTRA information.      The ending.....WOW!!! It was brutal, to say the least, but simultaneously it was ironically ok!  I would have penned a different ending, but I am not a world-renowned, national best-selling author, who has written 20 books.  Picoult had a clue with the ending; I am just trying to figure out, besides the irony, what her (Picoult's) clue was.      None-the-less, the ending was respectable!!    Recommendation:  I would recommend this novel for anyone who is interested in having a 'designer baby' or interested in the topic itself. I say get the book is you like tear-jerkers (at the end).  I say get the book if you like reading fictional books on real issues that plague our society today.  It will give you a better and more informed outlook.     WE NEED THAT!!!    The book was a good read.  The thing that made it a good read and not an excellent, absolute, must-read is that is was WAY TOOOOO LONG!!!  I am not against a 400 pgs book if it is 400 pgs of substance.  But this was not!!! Whereas I can appreciate the pull and tug...the push and pull of emotions-Picoult could have done the same thing in 300 pgs.  I enjoyed the twists and turns with the characters in the book, which helped the rating. But I would much rather read a page-turning 300 pgs book, than a slow winding 400 pg. book.  Thus, I would recommend this book for someone who has time...lots of time.  I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind reading a good book-dragged out.      The length of the book, which included things that book could have surely done without, gets this book a rating of a straight 4 stars!!     Finally, I say.....BUY IT, READ IT, AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!!

B002JWD6AS|4.0|I couldn't help but think of the Twilight books as I read Maggie Stiefvater's \\"Shiver\\". Maybe that is why I bought it in the first place. No matter it was a good book, geared more towards the teen population. It was predictable and a little drawn out. I still read it through, but am not sure I would recommend it to anyone already out of high school.
B003AYBD7W|2.0|This gold CD release is not worth the price and really isn't an upgrade. Compared with the original CD this disc lacks passion and involvement. I actually still prefer the original CD because it is engaging and fun to listen to.    This gold CD does have increased detail and resolution, but somehow it comes off as sterile and analytical. I have listened to it several times with an open mind and really tried to like it, but I still find myself reaching for the original US CD release. Do yourself a favor and spend the cash on another disc.     This is not a rant against Audio Fidelity in the least, they certainly have released some great sounding CDs. However, this particular release is a fail in my opinion. Better luck next time AF.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|The last and solid CD by the Scorpions, plenty of hard hitters that mimmic the 'Rock you like a Hurricane' sound and a few like the ' wind of change' sound. Will miss the scorps, but happy to have this album to complete my collection.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I got this to go with the Britax light-weight stroller.  It is perfect and can stay attached even when I collapse the stroller.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|The movie is wonderful. Scientific, whimsical, dramatic, thrilling, and surprising, everything I love about Sherlock Holmes stories. The music score blends perfectly with the settings, even a place for some pubsong.      The DVD however has several trailers that cannot be skipped, and must be fast-forwarded through individually.  This in and of itself makes me want to return it and buy a pirated copy because they don't have that.  I have already PAID for the dvd, I don't want to be forced into watching advertising as well.  I will watch the trailers the 2nd or 3rd time willingly, but if I am forced to watch them every time, you can bet I will NEVER want to see them in their own glory. Categorize it under:Bad Idea!      There are no deleted scenes or behind the scenes footage, basically no special features at all.  This is just disappointing.  Seriously, why spend the money on it, again WB is just making a good case for us to stop buying retail and pay less for a better product with the pirated copies.
0870703781|5.0|This is the second edition of this book, published many years ago by the MOMA.

B00004R99F|3.0|I wrote an entire review for this film and then realize that I was over thinking everything and that it was probably the most unhelpful review of a children's film ever written for this site.  It was starting to go over my own head.<br /><br />HA.<br /><br />So, I trashed it and started over.<br /><br />`A Goofy Movie' is Disney's attempt at a father/son film.  It stars the likable goof, Goofy and his son Max.  Max is getting in trouble for normal teenage boy pranks pulled to impress a girl, but obviously his dad wouldn't understand.  Goofy decides to take his son on a trip in order to `help him' but that is not the help he wants.<br /><br />`A Goofy Movie' has a message, a typical Disney schmaltzy message about family togetherness, but it's cute and effective to be wholly honest.  While it is far from the best animated film out there (and it pales in comparison to that other 95 mega-hit `Toy Story') it is sweet and has some charm to it.  From a technical aspect this film is mediocre.  The music isn't all that wonderful, although it has some catchy qualities to it.  It can at times seem lazy.  The humor is hot and miss, sometimes overly generic.  I mean, this cartoon has been done before MANY times with different characters.  There are not a whole lot of father/son type films out there, especially animated films, so this has that going for it, but I can't say that it really broaches the subject with much depth.<br /><br />This film is targeted at the funny bone of a child, and that works, but it doesn't really do much outside of that small box.<br /><br />I enjoyed this as a kid.  I'll admit that.  I was ten with this was released and I liked it.  I never flocked to it and I never owned it, but my friends did and I had no qualms with watching it at their house.<br /><br />That said; it's forgettable.
B003BZXHX8|5.0|Simply Satisfying!<br />I've just finished watching this absolutely divine show. For some reason I didn't have hi hopes for this Barbra, mini, concert. But was I ever wrong! The show on DVD is so intimate one feels as if they're really there at The Vanguard. There is a lot of chatter from Barbra, of course, between songs, which I loved! I had the feeling it took her a couple of songs to really warm up but when she did I suddenly remembered why I have adored from afar this woman for 36 years.  She blows this small audience away with \\"If You Go Away\\" .  Yet, when Ms. Streisand dives into songs like Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered, Make Someone Happy, Nobody Heart Belongs to Me, and The Way We Were, one feels as if they have sailed on a great boat with a great love and have experienced the most satisfying afternoon of one's life. Barbra Streisand rises above the bar once again and I pray our Barbra never goes away!

Many evenings of reading together with my son filled with laughter thanks to the Wimpy kid.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|Arctic silver 5 is one of the best computer thermal paste in the market, and it have done a great job that got so many customer positive feedback. So, people who looking for one and they can't really decide which to buy, this one will be the best for you to choose. Although there is another one in the market that actually works well, sometimes better than Arctic silver 5, but that one is not for beginers, that one is way harder for people to use, hard to apply and really  thick, if not apply that one properly, it will works way worse than Arcitc silver 5. So Arctic silver 5 is the best working and easiest to use.

0143038583|3.0|The book is both a delightful read and is informative to those not well versed in agricultural and nutritional economics.   It is in essence an adventure story, and there may very well be something to the theory that corn syrup will be the death of us all.  However, Pollan has a viewpoint and he does not adequately consider either the benefits of being able to supply a lot of food for a little money or the costs of expending proportionately more to generate \\"natural\\" food.  The implications for food elitism are insufficiently addressed.  Moreover, I cannot support Pollan in his choice of Peter Singer for expertise on the ethics of eating meat or any creature with a face, if that rubric has appeal.   For all his purported concern about animal rights, it is a concern he does not seem to want extended to his fellow man, for whom he believes that death shortly following live birth is preferable to a life with disability.  As such, I believe he is a sham as an ethicist and question Pollan's choice.      I also sense in this and other \\"pure\\" food works a desire to turn eating into a religion of sorts, which is not a big leap given food's traditional ritual significance.  In a secular age, this is particularly appealing, and indeed Pollan's Food Rules can be seen as a kind of Deuteronomy of the grocery store.   There is nothing wrong with this, as all are free (at least as of this week) to hold their own views.  Where this becomes problematic in my mind is when a belief system starts to become confounded with ostensibly empirical information.  There I believe some caution is in order.     That having been said, I am an avid reader of Pollan's work and hope he keeps it up.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|the movie arrived in its correct box but the cd looks bootleg. im not happy with that, albeit the movie plays fine. but still if i wanted a fake movie i couldve gone someplace else, not this guy. i think i just payed for the box, the art, one may surmise...

B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula is a horror masterpiece. The best version of Bram Stoker's thrilling novel. In hi-def, with video and audio superior quality, the movie seems to jump out of the screen. A must have blu-ray for all movie lovers.
B0037QGRZG|5.0|I firmly believe that in a 1000 years this film will still be played as an example of the finest art of American movie making ever. It's a remarkable story, Daniel Larusso is probably one of the most likeable kids ever played on screen. This movie has so many greats about it, it's hard to explain. The setting and characters in the movie are complex and wonderful. For a kid who grew up in the Midwest, this movie showed me what I believed California was really like. I really thought all kids in California hung out at the beach kicking soccer balls around fires and rode around on dirt bikes.<br /><br />The story is great, almost any male boy can recognize with the theme of this movie at sometime in their life, how to deal with bullies who are physically violent to you for no reason. Now let me say this as well, Johnny and the Cobra Kais were mislead by that psychotic karate instructor, \\"Johnny Kreese.\\" Now a little discussed topic about the Karate Kid is \\"what makes Kreese tick?\\" I think I have an answer and since my glowing review would probably sound like all the other 150 5 star reviews I'll just discuss one more complex character of the movie who is misunderstood.<br /><br />I beleive John Kreese, was sent to Vietnam at a young age, as a young man he was idealistic and had compassion for people. When he first saw combat, he had the oppurtunity to finish a wounded enemy soldier, instead he showed mercy and let the man live, immediately the man pulled a hand grenade and killed John's best friend. He realized that his weakness had gotten his friend killed, this angered him and plagued him with guilt, he then came to a conclusion, I must kill the enemy, or he will kill me. This is where it came to Kreese that \\"mercy is for the weak.\\" When John came home from the war he learned Karate, during his study he was taught that Karate is used for self defense. John never changed the philosophy of Karate, he just knew from practical experience that shooting a sniper before he shoots you was the best defense. This is the foundation of the Cobra Kai, the best defense is a strong and punishing offense. John loved his Cobra Kais, and that is why he was so tough on them, he wished his father was tougher on him when he was younger, so that he would not have had to grow up so quickly one fateful day in Vietnam. When you watch Karate Kid, do not judge Kreese as some brutal man who gets enjoyment out of watching a 15 year old kid get beaten, understand although his intentions and actions may seem misguided, his heart is just that of a patriot. He truly beleives the beatings Daniel takes will make him a stronger man, the ending of this movie is proof that Kreese, although portrayed as the bad guy, truly is the most motivating factor behind the whole movie. Ultimately and indirectly Kreese provides Daniel with friendship and self confidence that would not have happened otherwise.the best defense.

B0029LHW68|4.0|This album is my first true introduction to 30 Seconds to Mars. I liked \\"The Kill (Bury Me)\\" back in the day, but it never sparked more than a passing interest. I bought This is War over three months ago after hearing \\"Kings and Queens\\" on the radio and it has had a hold on me ever since.    Having now gone back to listen to their older albums, I can honestly say that nearly every track on This is War outshines their older work, and they've had some very good singles in the past. The strengths of Jared Leto's voice are really brought out on this album. He has an amazingly clear, powerful voice that wasn't as evident before; it really reaches down inside of you.     The instrumental, vocal, and lyrical sound of these tracks is so big, almost epic; they just sweep you up. It's a very powerful album.    My standout favorites are \\"Hurricane\\" and \\"Closer to the Edge\\", but honestly it's very hard to go wrong. Even tracks I didn't originally like have grown into favorites.     \\"Night of the Hunter\\" is extremely catchy; \\"Kings and Queens\\", fantastic; \\"Alibi\\", starts beautifully and builds to a fantastic finish; \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", other than the first lines of lyrics which are pretty rough, it's a very powerful song, great instrumentals. \\"100 Suns\\" is really the only song I don't like, and that's just personal preference.    Even if you didn't like them before, it's definitely worth giving them a try now. This is a new sound and a very well done album. I highly, highly recommend it.

1439153663|5.0|Lavinia is only seven years old when she is orphaned while on a ship sailing from Ireland to America. Sold into indentured servitude to a family who owns a plantation, Lavinia arrives and is immediately whisked away to the kitchen house of the property, where she will be raised by the African-American house slaves. As Lavinia grows up surrounded by and secure with her new surrogate family, she becomes enmeshed in their everyday lives and the difficulties that they have with the cruel overseer of the property, learning also to work in the big house and provide for the Captain and his family. But Lavinia's future takes a dramatic turn when the Captain and his wife fall ill with the yellow fever and Lavinia is soon living a more upper crust existence in Williamsburg. Gaining an education and social graces in Williamsburg, she makes an unexpected and advantageous marriage and soon finds herself back at the plantation, albeit in a very different role than in years past. In her new life, Lavinia finds herself constantly at odds over what is expected of her and what is expected of the people that she once called family. Both haunting and provocative, The Kitchen House tells the heartbreaking story a girl's life lived on both sides of the divide between slavery and freedom.<br /><br />I haven't read many books about slavery in America. I think it's probably because it's really hard to get over the feelings of shame that I have that a situation like this existed in my own country in times that are not that far removed.  It's painful for me to read and hear about slavery and its trappings and I often wonder when coming across books like this just what the ancestors of this great land were thinking in their practice of slavery. Though this book dealt with a very dark and malevolent period of American history, I found it fascinating, well written and sadly beautiful.<br /><br />I think one of the main thrusts of this story was the differences between the indenture of white servants and the slavery of Black Americans. Though both were expected to do hard labor for their respective masters, there was a world of difference in the way they were treated and in the fact that the indentured whites were at some point able to return to freedom. This was never the case for the slaves. They were owned by their masters for their entire lives, sometimes traded and sold to pay debts, and only in special circumstances were they ever given the papers that would grant them freedom. These differences were ones that Lavinia struggled with almost on a daily basis, and although there was an undeniable love between her and her adopted family, these differences were hard for her to understand. Only Lavinia, out of all the servants, was able to pass time with the lady of the house and learn to read. Later in the book these differences became more pronounced and painful for Lavinia to bear.<br /><br />The book puts forth a whole bevy of information about slavery. From the master's sexual cavorting with the women to the horrible starvation and beatings that the slaves endured at their master's hand, these sections were painful to read but also imbued the book with a piercing clarity and hubris. Grissom certainly doesn't shy away from uncovering all the gruesomeness that slavery entails and gives her characters room to muse on the unfairness and unhappiness of their lives, along with their simple joys. The chapters alternate between those in Lavinia's voice and those in the voice of Belle, a young African-American slave who is entrusted with Lavinia's care when she arrives at the plantation. Through the use of this shared narrative, the fullness of the story is magnified and both the story of the slaves and Lavinia's story are told with a great feeling of well rounded depth. There were times when the agony on the pages reached out and squeezed my heart and it was all I could do not to break down and weep with the unfairness and pain that the characters faced. The fear and sadness in the story were palpable but at times the narrative moved towards tenderness and beauty, particularly in the sections where Lavinia bonds and shares with her new family.<br /><br />It's hard to put into words the beauty and power of this book. It's a tale that screams violence and unfairness, but also love, hope and redemption. It's full of bitterness and cruelty, but peeking between all of that there is love, respect and dignity. There were some truly horrible and evil characters within its pages, yet there were also characters who were gentle, loving and humble. The story was one of juxtapositions and contrasts, evil and generosity, hopelessness and hope. One thing I really admired about Grissom's writing was the understated elegance of her prose. It wasn't flashy or over-adorned but it carried a quiet beauty and power that I found irresistible. Once I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down, for the life of Lavinia and her family had me entranced.<br /><br />Though this was a painful read at times, it was also delicate and touching. There was so much in the book to fall in love with and admire, and at its foundations, it's a story that needs to be told and heard. I could just go on and on about the haunting and lovely qualities of this book but instead I will just say that I truly loved it and that it's one that every reader should take a look at. Questions of conscience and responsibility are asked and answered, and the full impact of slavery and indentured servitude are laid out for all to see. The characters are easily some of the most unforgettable that I have come across and I quickly found myself caught up in their difficult plights. I was sad to see the book end but was very excited to hear that Grissom might be planning a sequel and I know I will definitely be reading it when it hits the shelf! A gorgeous and generous read, highly recommended!tory were palpable but at times the narrative moved towards tenderness and beauty, particularly in the sections where Lavinia bonds and shares with her new family.

0618526412|3.0|Four lonely characters center their lives around a deaf mute, Mr. Singer, who functions amidst them like a tabula rasa onto which they project whatever they need.  None of these other characters has an ability to connect in a deep and meaningful way with their peers.  In seeking Singer out, they project their needs onto him, and assume he understands them in ways no one else does, while he remains virtually unknown. Meanwhile, he is deeply connected to another deaf mute, who was committed to an asylum.  Singer's devotion to his friend, who in many ways is as obnoxious an individual as Ignatious T. Reilly (Confederacy of Dunces)is completely baffling.<br />There is a horrid sense of life passing by these characters and of them being cheated by life.<br />It was too fatalistic and depressing for my taste, without nearly as much craft as Richard Yates (Revolutionary Road).

B002M2T1UO|5.0|I had never seen this show before but a friend recommended it one morning at a breakfast. With the long winters in Montana and the crappy, commercial laden shows on TV I opted for a hundred bucks worth of entertainment. This is the bomb.........I have totally enjoyed Michael Chiklis in his role as hero/goat. He reminded me of Dennis Franz on NYPD....except Franz was not as shady. If you want a well written cop drama with intertwined plots threaded over numerous episodes, this is the one. My packaging was first class with no problems and I highly, highly recommend.    Postscript - We just finished watching the final episode.............Get it. I see the price is down 20 bucks as well. The West Wing is now on order with The Wire after that.........No stinking commercials to take 33% of our life either.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar was a great film, there's no doubt about that.  This was one the best productions of all time which was reflected in box office and media sales.  I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable, fresh, and revolutionary with remarkable replay value.  However, this review focuses on the quality of this 1st release BD version.    True 16:9, no \\"gutterbox\\" bars:  To my surprise, the movie is in full 16:9 (1.78:1) ratio so no black bars at the top and bottom of your widescreen. The vast majority of us don't own a 100+ inch super wide projection studio so this format allows you to enjoy every viewable pixel of your plasma/LCD/DLP.  Personally, I would rather utilize the entire screen than sacrifice nearly half of the display to see a few extra Pandoran trees in the background.    Resume technology:  This BD disc has an incredible and revolutionary technology that will literally remember your position in the movie (has resume capability which is extremely ultra super freaky rare).  This \\"resume\\" feature comes in very handy for a movie that is nearly 3 hours in length.  I never understood why the vast majority of BD movies lack this feature, seems like a common ability that every VHS tape and DVD was capable of providing and yet so very few BDs will remember your last location. Perhaps the majority of BD releases are intentionally programmed to force the viewer re-watch all the trailers every single time they turn on their player. Fortunately, this BD doesn't punish you, it was made for your enjoyment!    Trailer free:  We all know how incredibly frustrating it is to be forced to wait or manually skip through hordes of previews/trailers every time you load a disc but this BD disc has none and boots directly to the movie menu (no promotional spam to skip/wait though)!! You don't even have to deal with the traditional copyright protection screen that forces you to let it run its course as it seems to have been completely excluded (not like we didn't already know that bootlegging was illegal anyways).    No extras:  This BD release was completely free of any extras which probably contributed to the remarkably reasonable pricing. Some may find this as a negative but I virtually never access the extras menu, probably < 1% of the time and it's usually just for the deleted scenes. I loved Avatar but I'm not a fan boy of the movie or the actors/actresses.  I don't want to know how they did the special effects nor do I care to hear how the director constructed such and such prop, in doing so they would spoil the \\"magic\\" of the movie. I intentionally avoid the extras for this very reason. I want to revel in the shock and awe of the refined production and not break down the behind the scene mechanics of it all. If this disappoints you, don't worry, I assure you that they will release a \\"special edition\\" with your favorite actor's commentaries for twice the price down the road.    Bargain pricing:  This 2010 initial release bundle includes the DVD version of the full movie in addition to the Blu-Ray movie.  You can sell the DVD for $10 or more, just as I have, and the BD with case ends up being under $10 from Amazon!  That's an incredible bargain for one of the most incredible movies of modern times.    I wish every BD release was modeled in this fashion for they went above and beyond with this Avatar BD and polished it to what I consider to be perfection.    Movie: 5/5  Value: 5/5  Quality of the BD picture/sound: 5/5  (quite possibly the best to date and reference quality)  BD features, menu, layout: 5/5  (what every BD should strive provide to end-users, simplicity & speed yielding high entertainment value)
0143145754|5.0|This is the sequel to \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\"  I loved both books.  I did the audio book for each.  Both were narrated by the author which gave it a conversational feel.  She has a an enjoyable voice and style.  I strongly suggest you hear \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" first.  It's about the author's travel and experiences after her divorce.  Toward the end of that book she fell in love with Felipe, a Brazilian-born man of Australian citizenship who'd been living in Indonesia when they met.  (I also fell in love with him.)  They wanted to live together in the United States, but U.S. Immigration wouldn't allow Felipe to enter the U.S. unless they married.  However, they couldn't do this for over a year while waiting on document processing.  \\"Committed\\" is Elizabeth's research and thinking about what marriage means.  It is also about Elizabeth's and Felipe's travel and experiences during their waiting time.<br /><br />At the end of the first book, I wanted to know what would happen with Felipe and Elizabeth.  I loved hearing their story in \\"Committed\\" and hearing Elizabeth's research and thoughts about marriage.  And I'd like a follow-up maybe ten years later.  I believe that \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" will have a wider audience than \\"Committed.\\"  So it's important to read them in order.<br /><br />One thing I found especially interesting was the author's discussion of the marriage benefit imbalance.  Actuarial charts for a long, happy, prosperous existence show several ways marriage benefits men, but not so for women.<br /><br />I disagree with one reviewer who wrote the following.  The reviewer \\"felt uncomfortable with the amount of very personal information\\" the author \\"revealed about her husband and her parents. A confessional approach to one's own life by a memoirist is one thing; to expose and discuss other peoples' intimate feelings and issues seems exploitative.\\"  I disagree.  I loved hearing all of this.  The same reviewer also wrote \\"this gives the book a talky, chatty quality that does not translate well to the written page. There are too many \\"anyways\\", redundancies and extraneous phrases.\\"  It worked well for me, maybe because I did the audio book instead of the written book.  For other reasons indicated in my review of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" I recommend both books as audio books over the written books.<br /><br />Data:<br />Copyright: 2010.

157421327X|1.0|The front and back covers are given page numbers too, so basically there are only 15 pages in here. I thought it would be a bit more of a comprehensive introduction to many of the techniques of zentangles. I guess that's why there is a zentangle 2, which should have been added in with this one. A few pages per book?? I should have just saved my money and got the \\"official\\" zentangle kit at their website instead.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I was skeptical about this movie based on some of the reviews, and knew nothing about Aeon Flux prior to this movie.  I took a chance and found it quite good.  If you are a sci-fi fan you may well find this enjoyable as I did.
B00364K6YW|5.0|If you are looking at reviews for Pride and Prejudice on DVD via Amazon, beware! The site has combined the reviews for all the versions, the good, the bad, and the ugly. If you can find the VHS you will see the mini-series in all its glory; this restored version is the restoration of that original. This is the DVD to buy!<br />The special edition is a terrible remake; as others say here, the colors are so washed out, it's hard to tell a yellow from a white, green from  yellow, and so on. Color in the original is sharp and clear, viz.Eliza Bennett's complexion after a walk.  I almost sent my copy back but never got around to it.Even the two-disc jacket is a washout. Do not waste your money on the \\"special\\" edition. Somewhere in these thousand reviews, I reviewed that edition and urged people to look for the VHS, it was so bad. I guess BBC finally figured out why. I know there will be comments about the technical improvements, about how they \\"restored\\" the series, so I'll move on.<br /><br />The story will always be a delight for both men and women as it centers on the human condition of both in pursuit of the elusive Mr. or Ms. Right. It is especially funny when Austen puts Mr. and Mrs. Bennett under the microscope: married couples will have a ball with this relationship! The theme is Austen's favorite; IMO this is her best rendering of that theme: the manners and mores of 19th c. England, esp. its class divisions and laws of primogeniture. That the two main characters overcome obstacles both outside and inside themselves is a triumph. The film is true to the book, almost line by line, which is lovely as it captures Austen's satirical wit and tender sensitivity. The actors are impeccable, all of them, and I guarantee you will never find a better performance of Mrs. Bennett's character as you will in this film!<br />I won't retell the story as generations are reading and watching the novel for the first time. Let me just urge you to purchase this restored version of the series -- it's ten stars on the five-star chart!
0739308726|5.0|I bought this audio which is the third in the series of George Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\"  for my daughter as a birthday gift.  She has the other two of these and loves listening to these as she travels back and forth to work.  She goes on and on about how great this series is..and this audio set (third of series) is in excellent condition.  Its arrival was as stated and no problems with delivery and the condition on receiving was excellent.  Thanks again.
144042974X|3.0|So, Siddhartha doesn't stay with The Buddha because he doesn't think *anybody's* teachings will bring him to enlightenment.  Then, he decides he's been running from, and fearing his self.  He decides to stop doing that, and suddenly, he's enlightened, and he sees things for what they really are, etc.<br /><br />Umm...I read this long ago, and am reading it again, and I don't get how getting to know himself - only NOT in the know-thyself, self-as illusion. Buddhist way - makes him enlightened. It seems that Hesse is saying that getting to know yourself is the way.  You know, that's about as far from Buddhism or any kind of Eastern belief about the self as one can get. So, WTF is Hesse saying?!  WHY is this a classic?! Aside from a story about a seeker in India, what about it makes it worth reading by the multitude?  Some things are just lost on me, really.  It may be inspiring to spiritual seekers, if you can get something spiritually useful out of it, but what makes it exceptional literature?  I suspect that most people don't know. It's about seeking and enlightenment, but I doubt that many will read this, and become enlightened.  I doubt that you'll find many quotes from this book used elsewhere.  Nobody carries it around, that I've observed, to refer to it, and so handle things in their life better.<br /><br />Well, so far, I guess I think it's overrated.  Interesting story, yes, but great?  I can't see it.

0691126658|5.0|As another reviewer mentioned, there's a problem with the editions Amazon is selling.  The first edition of this book was published in 2002. As of 5/5/2010 the ISBN number on this page is for the 2006 edition, although I was sent the 2002 edition.  Hopefully after my bringing it to their attention they will correct the error (if you look in the information about the publication it says it was published in 2002, so if that's changed they will likely have corrected the problem).

0756405890|3.0|I bought this book based on the raving and extraordinarily good reviews given to it almost everywhere. Simply put for other people to know: I think all the reviews or almost all of them are exceedingly high. I completed the book and really the last 50 or 100 pages were kinda of a drag. I do admit that I read some 2 or 1 star reviews by that time and maybe became influenced by these, but after finishing the book my opinion was not too different from these people.   The book as a product is enjoyable if you keep  in mind the following:  - 700 pages long  - very few things happen in terms of action,relocations,character development other than the main one  - very few really entertaining moments    Keeping in mind that, if you still go ahead I think you will enjoy it. We know 2 more books are coming but as explained my Mr. Rothfuss the second book is even larger. Will more things happen? Will the plot expand more and let more characters in? I hope. I recommend the book but I would never give it the huge and explosive reviews other people have done.   They even tell us to put it next to Tolkien´s TLOTR trilogy as a new generation masterpiece! I think this went really too far.  I would still have to actually see the second book as a paperback, check other potential fantasy titles I want to read also and then decide whether to read it or not.  Best respects to Mr. Rothfuss as this is his first novel.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|The movie was not that good, nor were the cinematics.  They were just average.  Maybe the 3D was OK, but that isn't in this disc.  In fact, nothing is on the disc except the movie.   I like how they kick off earth day with the sale of these discs when they are just going to try to sell them all over again when they releases all the extended versions with extras and 3D in a few months.  All of these plastic DVDs and cases that people will probably have double of will look real nice in a landfill somewhere.
B00005JM0B|5.0|As time has gone by, I now realize that the strongest film \\"trilogy\\" in all of film history may absolutely be the TERMINATOR franchise! I'm not even going to get into the continuation past the first 3 films because I actually think that the first 3 are good enough to complete the series. While T1 and T2 both have the reputation of being iconic, legendary films, I have to pointedly admit, before I get into the details of the review for this third film of the trifecta TERMINATOR 3 (T3):RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003), that I absolutely enjoyed T3 upon first viewing MORE than I did either T1 or T2! And I freely admit that I believe T3 to be BETTER than T2 and close to as good as T1! And I don't think my opinion will ever change on this.  T1 is quite frankly perhaps the best sci-fi action film of all time. The T1 special effects are somewhat dated, but the futuristic Skynet scenes were still waaaaay ahead of their time and the stop-motion effects set the stage for later successful sci-fi genre films of the 80s. The T1 effects are just as influential for the 80s as T2 was for CGI in current films. But the main draw of T1 is it's audaciously scary atmosphere, breakneck pace, original and complex story, solid script, and terrific performances. T2, IMHO, is very overrated film and ironically is the opposite of T1 in that T2 lacks in all the areas that make T1 great (story, script, pace, acting) and compensates (to an extent) in the one area that T1 falls a bit short (the special effects). But, based on influence in the area of big-budget effects/CGI, T2 is undeniably a visually stimulating film, if heavily flawed one. T2 had a good ideas and a believable story, but the execution was subpar IMHO. That said, T2 is necessary as a piece to the puzzle to link the 3 films together.   T3 has the advantage in that it is able to \\"borrow\\" elements that made both T1 and T2 great and pattern a more complete film. But, it doesn't work IF you don't have the right filmmaker for the job. I amhere to tell all, in the absence of T1 and T2's maker James Cameron, the director of T3, Jonathan Mostow, has done a MASTERFUL job! And I'm not sure Cameron could have done better because I think he lost his storytelling ability a long time ago. Mostow takes the best parts of both T1 and T2 and formulates perhaps the most fully eye-popping, enjoyable film of the franchise. He also injects it with timely, very appealing humor that pays homage to the the first 2 films. But make no mistake, T3 is NOT just a trivial popcorn summer action flick...it actually has a real pulse and heart to boot that underscores all of the action and humor...Fancy that!  Not only does T3 stay faithful to the Terminator franchise, but also it is an exciting and original action film the likes of which I don't think had been done since the late 80s/early 90s. In retrospect, I actually think that T3 may perhaps be the best ACTION film of the 00s. And that is NOT a joke! I think much of the negativity against T3 has a lot to do just with the fact that it is within the domain of the Terminator franchise and held up to a certain standard that most other actions films would not. If one just looks at this film objectively, knowing nothing about Terminator, it is one heck of a fun, nonstop wild ride! A huge reason that the action scenes work in T3 is not just due to their scope and energy, but also because a high percentage of it is REAL, that is, very little to no CGI! This was real actors doing real stunts and what little CGI that exists in T3 is integrated so well into the real action that you don't even notice it's there. That's an accomplishment!   I must add to all this that just b/c I think T3 is the best action film of the 00s doesn't mean I think it is equal to T1 overall, which is the best of all time. I mean, in the 80s T1 was up against BLADE RUNNER, ALIENS, PREDATOR, and ROBOCOP, all highly received movies during that time and all of which are still highly regarded classics. While in the00s, T3 is up against TRANSFORMERS, the STAR WARS prequels, and G.I. JOE; an action film half as good as T3 could have beaten out those empty-headed CGI-infested crapfests! T3 is kind of the best action film by default (but I think it would still rate high in the pre-CGI era) because it avoided CGI as much as possible, went with realism, and made it work. I'm not sure any other film in the 00s did this!  Now, to the actors! The great Arnold Schwarzenegger shines in his last film role (before politics) as the T850, a slightly advanced model from the T800 of T1 and T2; the T850 is programmed to sustain more damage and also to analyze and react to human emotions. Just like in T2, in T3 Arnie is the good Terminator sent back to early 21st century Los Angeles to protect John Connor (played this time by Nick Stahl in a captivating performance) and a new character Kate Brewster (refreshingly played by Clare Danes). John and Kate have an important connection to the future salvation of the human race. Arnie's T850 was sent back to protect John and Kate from the highly advanced TX model, which is, in addition to being liquid metal in configuration like the T1000 in T2, also body-equipped with an armed arsenal. The TX is played by newcomer Kristanna Loken and this gorgeous actress was simply amazing in this role, what should be a starmaking performance; she nails the part of the determined, resourceful, cold-blooded killing machine. Arnie from T1 and Patrick from T2 would be proud! Being the main human characters, Stahl and Danes get the bulk of the dialogue and display top-notch acting, but both Arnie and Loken make the most of their miniscule lines, especially Arnie of course! But Loken actually gets to do a lot of physical stuff similar to Patrick in T2 and she is quite convincing. And Arnie's one-liners are absolute gold in this film! They remind us of Arnie's brilliant comic timing in his 80s movies, but they are fused well with the more modern references and will probably never grow old! T3 is the final reminder that Arnie is the GREATEST action film star of all time!   I know I keep bringing up T1 and T2 a lot when referring to T3, but it feels necessary as T3 did such a bang up job borrowing from those films and forging it's own identity. And T3 adds in perfectly timed humor that keeps one interested in the action. But the main reason the action works is because time is invested in the characters, thanks mainly to a top notch script. We care about what happens to the characters, so that makes the action more palpable. Also, a thing I noticed upon repeated viewings is how well the MINOR characters were done in this; I found their reactions to all the craziness going on to be spot on and authentic (you know, the way REAL people would act!). It's rare to get this in an action movie. The director actually took the time to ensure that ALL actors were up to the task...Crazy, huh?!  And what action there is! I almost forgot the best part...The action is literally nonstop, is brilliantly edited, and is not there just for show. Every action moment is NECESSARY to move the plot along. (1) The first big scene is a big reason why T3 is contender for decade's best action film: a jaw-droppingly exciting and intense 10-minute chase scene ripe with police cars, fire engines, a civilian vehicle, and a crane! People should be talking for YEARS on how they accomplished that amazing scene!(2) The pulse-pounding middle graveyard scene, and (3) The climactic battle between Arnie's T850 and Loken's TX at the Skynet facility, not only the best fight of the Terminator series, but one of the best fights ever portrayed in any film!  But in the midst of all the action, the film has a lot of heart and humor, as well as a thoughtful, provocative ending. My T3 review might seem like too much praise, but we're talking about a fully entertaining throwback action film (in the CGI era and the 00s, possibly the worst decade for film ever!) with healthy doses of humor and wit for good measure AND the advantage of being a Terminator film...Sounds like a winner to me! Also, I feel this film is hugely  underrated and a lot of the unfavorable reviews seem to say it is a ripoff of T2, a film that I barely even like! T3 has a lot more in common with T1 (which I love) than T2. Probably a big reason why I rate it so highly.  I highly recommend that anyone buy the dvd of this film because it is more than just a simple action movie. There is a lot of subtlety in the script and character detail that you may not pick up on the first time because of the breakneck pace, humor, and action that is ever-present...Buy it ASAP!
B002OHB3CG|5.0|I discovered Within Temptation over Christmas with this CD \\"An Acoustic Night at the Theatre.\\"  After listening to the CD I wanted to hear more from them...especially the original versions of the songs, so I ended up purchasing \\"The Heart of Everything\\" and \\"Mother Earth\\" within a week (and then \\"Silent Force\\" about a month later).  All I can say is WOW!  This band is incredible.  The melodies, rhythms and Sharon's vocals have completely won me over.  And they are so consistently good!  I can listen to each CD all the way through. That is so rare these days.  So many CDs today have only 3-4 decent to great songs on them, and yet Within Temptation manages whole CDs of great songs.    I say this is a great introduction to Within Temptation because the acoustic versions of the songs highlight the melodies and Sharon's voice, and leave you wanting more. And so you do what I did - go out and buy the original versions of the songs and find they are even more incredible. It is actually very interesting to hear the differences between the acoustic set and the original versions and you find yourself listening a little more closely to everything to pick out the changes.  The audience during this live performance was very respectful so there is little noise from the crowd while the songs are performed; you'd almost think it was done in a studio except for the applause between songs.    I now have \\"The Heart of Everything,\\" \\"Mother Earth\\" and \\"Silent Force\\" in rotation in my car, and I also purchased the blu-ray \\"Black Symphony.\\" When I want something a little quieter I throw in \\"Acoustic Night at the Theatre.\\"  I love and recommend them all.
B001BPJJ9G|1.0|From the cover and back-story it sounded like The Fall was going to be light-hearted whimsical fun. It turned out to be a pretentious disappointment.  This movie tried too hard to be unique. The plot is too simplistic and is a major downer. The plot is about the development of a friendship between a paralyzed stunt-actor and a female child. It takes place in a hospital. The stunt-actor tells stories to the girl which involves a large portion of the movie. In between the stories the girl is used to steal painkillers for the stunt-actor. The stories are not uplifting at any level. They involve several unconventional characters that have absolutely no character development and go on a quest that is completely trite and uninteresting. The cinematography is eye-catching and colorful but is ultimately devalued because of the morose plot and banal drug-induced stories. It is very difficult to appreciate the hard work put into the cinematography and costumes. Great cinematography doesn't make a movie solid. Anyone can pin up a tropical island calendar and get the exact same effect. Throughout the movie I felt sad for the girl and the stunt-actor. When I watch a movie I want to feel inspired and motivated not depressed. Grade: D-
B003E48AYC|5.0|I saw the coming attractions to Alice In Wonderland in an IMAX theater, in 3-D, in summer of 2009.  I actually CLAPPED and cheered at the end of the coming attractions, which is the first time in my life I have ever clapped and cheered a coming attraction.  So I was anxious to see the whole movie, and I had to wait 8 full months for it to be released... a long wait... but well worth waiting for.<br /><br />I won't go into the details of WHY I loved the movie... I loved it, and I want to have it in my library...<br /><br />But IF IT IS NOT IN 3D, I will not buy it for home viewing, and I will not recommend it to anybody.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland, the movie, gets 5 stars in 3D, and zero stars in 2-D.  I won't even THINK of buying it in 2-D.<br /><br />HOW DUMB DO THEY THINK WE ARE?  3-D television has arrived.  What are they waiting for to release it in 3D?<br /><br />November 2012: Ha!  Only ONE out of TWELVE persons found my review \\"helpful\\"... And 11 out of 12 did NOT find it \\"helpful\\"!!!<br /><br />I wrote my review before the 3-D version came out, so maybe somebody actually LISTENED TO ME.  It hurts me to think that only one out of 12 persons thought my review was helpful, because I was trying to say something important when I wrote it...<br /><br />But perhaps that ONE out of 12 persons was thought my review was helpful was somebody who had something to do with the decision to finally release a 3-D Version!<br /><br />THAT would be a happy ending, wouldn't it?  Maybe my review did some GOOD, after all.<br /><br />Cheers...
1552091090|1.0|I agree with everything I have read from the other one star reviews. Someone gave me this book today while getting rid of their kid's old stuff, and told me we'd LOVE it. Later I was told by my mom, \\"Oh I remember when I worked at a bookstore that was a HUGE seller, you cannot read it without crying.\\" So I decided to read it to my son, knowing I'd probably get sucked in to what sounded like a sappy story, but the weirdest thing happened. As I'm reading, the whole \\"fear of my mother dying/leaving my son one day\\" thing was totally getting me, but at the same time the logic part of my brain is going, \\"wow these are hideous and strange illustrations, and this is actually really CREEPY!\\" Crawling across the floor in the dark and peeking up to see if the kid is asleep- what if he wasn't asleep?! She would've scared him to death. Then he gets older, and becomes a teenager, who is apparently zoo-like, but she loves him anyway. At night. While he's asleep. While she rocks him like a baby. Frightening! Then it just gets crazy as we see her driving across town at night with a ladder on her car!!! To climb in her son's window and rock her adult son, who apparently is a VERY heavy sleeper or drugged, like a baby. She is not only clingy and obsessed, but very strong for an old woman. And her son, who later has a baby himself, sleeps in a twin bed, alone. Its just bizarre. And the image of him holding his mother when she's all old and DYING is just beyond upsetting and strange and I just do not see how people love this book and give it 5 stars. Its clearly a love it or hate it book, and shortly after reading it I decided I'm in that latter category. I felt totally manipulated after reading it, and it angered me! Luckily my son didn't pay attention at all while I read it to him, ( I really should have read it to myself first!) but he did notice my voice shaking and my tearing up as I got to the end where the mother gets old and dies. This is not a nice thing for a child to see andfeel, this book is creepy and icky. There are way better books about motherly love that won't give you nightmares or a death complex. There are so many things wrong with this book I can't even get to them all, but there are a lot of great reviews on here that express just how warped this book is.  Oh- and what a deceptive cover!!! It could not be more misleading.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is not the current (2010) Carol King/James Taylor concert. This combo CD/DVD is from the November 2007 Los Angeles Troubadour concert. But no mind. The magic is there. The music is there. And the love is there.     As James Taylor said during the concert, Carol and James are pitching and the intimate Troubadour audience is catching. Backed by guitarist Danny Kortchmar, bassist Leland Sklar and drummer Russell Kunkel--all stars in their own right--everyone has fun. Even with those oh-so-familar songs, no one phones it in.    The high point for me is the point and counter point between King and Taylor on \\"Up On The Roof.\\"  Both artists had hits with this Goffin-King song and both take turns singing verses in their own style. They both eventually join together for the song's climax. The arrangement is brilliant and very cool.     The camera work on the DVD is shaky at times and has focus problems. On the upside, the audio is encoded in both Dolby Digital and DTS. The 5.1 sound is excellent. Plus you have the uncompressed audio on the CD--a generous combination.     Nathaniel Kunkel is the recording engineer. I assume that he is related to Russ Kunkel.  Peter Asher produced.     If you like James Taylor or Carol King--or just want to step back to the 1970s with two classic and classy performers, this CD/DVD is sure not to disappoint.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|i hate westerns by and large, and i am usually not into sci fi. so i am very glad that i didnt know this was a scifi western when someone told me i should watch it!<br />when i saw the movie(Serenity, also very good!) i liked it alot and one of my friends told me he had the series the show is based off of, so i watched it and in  two words: FRIKKING AWESOME!! funny, enough action to satisfy, story out the wazoo and so much wasted potential!! Damn you fox!!! and i dont understand why people say there is bad acting... they're nuts. anyway, if i could buy it new i would!
0385495323|4.0|This is a well written book from an author with great knowledge on the topic. Don't be put off by all the talk about 'Where is the American side of the story' because in all honesty it's nice to read a book which is not so pro American for a change! A breath of fresh air.
0671027573|2.0|I just recently discovered Linda Howard.  Mr. Perfect is my 8th novel by her.  I absolutely adored After the Night, Shades of Twilight and Dream Man.  Coming in next was Kill and Tell and All the Queen's Men.  Then there was Now You see Her and Cry No More.  I gave them all 5 stars - even though After the Night, Shades of Twilight and Dream Man should have gotten 10 stars!  However, I just finished Mr. Perfect and am sorry to say, I did not enjoy this one that much.  Maybe it was because Jaine was a little too caustic and maybe just a little too funny for me.  It could be my problem.  I don't know, but this one, I will not recommend.  Not that I didn't love the \\"Sam\\" character, I did.  I will be shortly moving on to her next novel - because 1 out of 8 isn't bad and so far, other than Mr. Perfect - I  adore Linda Howard!
0385341008|4.0|A light read with heart warming, refreshing, and delightful stories of very interesting residents of the island.  Some of them are a little too predictable for my taste, but there are delicious surprises as well. A great substitute for traditional, commercialized, no depth \\"summer reading\\" books.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I'll be straight to the point. The material is top notch, excellent content, excellent quality, but poor narration. Oprah has to be the worst narrator choice. What were they thinking? When I discovered that Sir David Attenborough was on the BBC version, I just deleted the rest of the episodes on my DVR.
B001TK41H8|5.0|Hands down, Sharon Kay Penman is the greatest historical novelist I have ever read.<br />After reading 5 or 6 of her novels, I picked up a couple of other authors but had to put them down after a chapter or two. Ms Penman is in a class of her own.<br />I agree with reviewers that have requested a more complete genealogy. With such a large cast of characters, some with the same name, I am occasionally distracted as I struggle to visualize the character's lineage. Thank you Ms. Pennman for the gift you have given us all.

You can get some great ideas for projects and how to use Zentangles in art from this basics book. Some patterns in this first book and Zentangles 2 are repeated, so you will be disappointed if you buy both books thinking you'll get double the tangle ideas (I was).

B00021HBGS|5.0|I agree, this bag of tub toys is great!  My 2 kids (4 and 6 years in age) are having fun with the school bus, fire truck, airplane, trucks, motorcycle, cars, road sections and road signs.  They are soft and light, they stick around the tub and the walls.  Foams are not flimsy, they are thick and sturdy.  Not only it is fun a it is also creative and educational.  It comes with a plastic storage pouch that has a suction cup so you can leave it within the bathtub area.  Excess water will drip off as the bag is made of nylon net.  The toys are cute and very colorful.  Nice idea for gift.
1416550550|5.0|Throughout this book, there are many character's stories being told in several time periods. This was hard for me to get used to at first but once I did, I was completely wrapped up in the story and couldn't put it down. The tale unfolds as we learn about several different women of varying circumstances and in different periods of time. As I read, I felt a desire to do my own digging in my family's history! I especially loved the fairy tales and the imagination Eliza had. Without giving anything away, I will just say I really liked it!
B003EPPEP4|5.0|Nikki is totally awesome.  One of the best young artist I've ever had the privilege of listening to.
B002TZS5GU|3.0|In a nutshell \\"Carriers\\" is a George A Romeo film without zombies. Or maybe \\"28 Days Later\\" without undeads for that matter. The first feature film (by the Spanish-born Àlex Pastor and David Pastor) feels less like a horror movie than a character study drama, about ordinary people under the most horrific circumstances. This is not to say that \\"Carriers\\" is without scares. Also, the film has its own peculiar charm and the filmmakers did a cleaver job of creating a very bleak post-apocalyptic world within limited budget, but as you watch the film, you might get a strong feeling of déjà vu all over again.    Meet four young travelers Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), Brian (Chris Pine), Bobby (Piper Perabo) and Kate (Emily VanCamp). They are actually survivors of a global pandemic and they know any physical contact with the \\"carriers\\" means death, which, it is suggested, a slow one. Now they encounter a father (Christopher Meloni) and his daughter (Kiernan Shipka) stranded on the desert road. Their best option is to leave and forget them. They could have done so if it had not been a small accident.    The rest of the film's story is fairly predictable. I don't reveal too much here, but suffice it to say that most episodes of the film have already been done in other end-of-the-world movies. I can also point out that Danny and Brian are brothers with very different personalities, a wild and reckless type and a silent and contemplative type. Actors did a fine job, but their journey's end is nothing surprising.    Some say people exhibit extraordinary courage and strength in facing great dangers. The Pastor brothers seem not to believe that. That is OK with me as long as the filmmakers provide something new. The beautiful cinematography of Benoît Debie (\\"Irréversible\\" \\"Innocence\\") is worth a look and fans of Chris Pine will enjoy watching his fine acting (the film was completed in 2007 before he became internationally famous as a new James T. Kirk), but \\"Carrier\\" is a thriller that is decent but a bit too familiar.
B000Y179KO|4.0|Just saw an amazing Eagles concert, and felt I had to go out and get this CD.  I've been reading the reviews, and can understand how some people would pan it.  If you're looking for the Eagles to act like they are the same people they were 30 years ago, and to make you feel like they made you feel 30 years ago, you're probably going to be disappointed.      Instead, I think this is a gutsy move by an incredibly talented band to be upfront and honest about where they are in life now, what they care about now and the lessons they've learned.  I can't imagine them writing some of these same lyrics 30 years ago... In Waiting In the Weeds \\"A small gray spider spinning in the dark, in spite of all the times the web has been torn apart\\" (which of us hasn't felt that way about things we gave our all to, but felt we came up short?), or in Do Something \\"It's too easy not to care and you're not ready for the rocking chair\\" (which of us hasn't gotten more apathetic as we've gotten older?).  For some of the songs, I wondered whether they were written for/about their children but disguised as something else... in Fast Company \\"Turn to me and help me try to remember that raging fire that the years put out\\" (for those who have had to deal with a rebellious teenager that can't seem to get their act together).    I found the CD brave, honest, touching and inspirational.  My only complaint is that there wasn't enough quality material for Joe Walsh.  At a minimum, they could have added One Day at a Time to the CD (from the Farewell I tour).  It would have fit nicely with the rest of the material.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|So I wandered over to a friend's house and they had an interesting looking movie playing called Moon. On the surface, it looked very similar to 2001: a Space Odyssey. Having a keen appreciation for Hal 2000 and his ilk, I curled myself up into a comfy chair and watched it.    The story centers around one guy named Sam manning a station on the moon with his robot helper Gerty. Things begin to go wrong and Sam needs to be rescued... from himself and the crushing sense of loneliness that permeates every single scene in this film.    Gerty was not Hal and seemed to have a better programmer, who had learned from  prior buggy programs. It made for a much more interesting robotic character. The little signs that Sam posted on the robot's camera assembly and the screen with the smilies made the bot more of a companion. The smilies also helped illustrate that Gerty wore two faces throughout the movie.    I haven't had a feeling of this much cinematic isolation in a long while. The sets are bleak and either impersonally industrial or the lunar landscape. The human figures, especially outside the little moon base, are lost in the frame, made tiny by the landscape. Inside, the marks left by Sam trying to remind himself of home are stubborn little patches of brightness against the clinically white interior.    While the aesthetic is reminiscent of 2001, the narrative is a different creature entirely. The story is very much a closed box with someone stuck inside. For a while he's happy, looking forwards to going home and then things start to happen. Sam begins to see things, memories that don't make sense... culminating in the rover crash. The movie shifts between very creepy psychological horror, desperate prison break and self acceptance in a very short timeframe. The ending is pretty open, and simultaneously rather sad and victorious.    The major drawback this film has is that the pacing is achingly slow. While it certainly generates tension and buildup for the small bursts of discovery and resolution, I would recommend watching this film while fully awake and with caffeine on hand. It fells a lot longer than it actually is.    Even so, I would fully recommend this film. I might watch it again myself, but I'll forgo the comfy chair in favor of the floor. ;)
B0012GVKVY|5.0|Back in the days of \\"Fresh Prince\\" Will Smith was a blast of fresh air in the genre, but in this movie he shows that he is a major talent. This combined with the great FX on the Blu-ray makes this an enjoyable movie.

B001HN69AY|4.0|Basically your enjoyment of the movie comes down to this    - If you love Terry Gilliam's fantasy films, you will love/like this one.  - If you don't like his fantasy films (or any of his films) don't bother.    I for one loved it.  It is a fitting final film for Heath Ledger (who played the Joker, and passed away halfway through the filming) as well another masterpiece by Terry Gilliam.  It may not be as brilliant as Brazil, Baron Munchhausen, Fear and Loathing, or 12 Monkeys, but it is definitely good . . . from the point of view of someone who loves his films.    So, if you love his films, this one is worth your time.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|There were many groundbreaking things about the Shield as far as filming techniques, characterization, pacing, etc.  But what they really nailed perfectly was the management of the story arcs.    There is a spectrum of show structures where the extreme ends would be ...    1)  Shows where each episode is entirely self-contained, and you can watch it without knowing what happened before.    2) Shows where knowledge of the prior history is required to enjoy the show.    Most shows generally fall somewhere in the middle.      What made the Shield unique was the way it had multiple story lines (up to 10 going on at a time) that ranged from the very short (single episode) to very long (spanning multiple seasons).  These story lines would intersect in unpredictable and amazing ways.  A character that appeared earlier in one of the long story lines may suddenly have an effect in one of the shorter ones.    It's hard to relate this, because it was so complex.  But it was so well done that it seemed each episode had a \\"WOW\\" moment where something happened that could only have been setup by these complex interactions.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|I really liked Quarantine and after watching it I heard about the original Spanish movie, (rec), I knew I had to watch it. I consider myself kind of a horror movie buff. When I watched the Ring, I had to buy the Ringu set (the original Japanese movies) and just about every great American horror movie can be traced to a foreign original or counterpart, so I got excited about (rec). It absolutely upheld my expectations. The subtitles don't take anything away from the suspense and the story made much more sense than the movie. In fact, I still can't figure out what Quarantine is ACTUALLY about because it's just scary without a well thought out story line. The only thing I will say is that the American \\"infected\\" actors have really figured out how to act the part, when in some (rec) scenes the acting falls short a little bit. The first \\"infected\\" older woman that the firefighters respond to at the beginning of the movie, looks like an old woman with makeup on...more like an extra than an actor. I still give it 5/5 and for anyone that got scared during Quarantine, (rec) is a must see!
B001FB55LC|5.0|The two male leads of this movie are absolutely two of the best. Jake has shown, from his beautiful, sensitive protrayil in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" to this epic, and his co-star, from his days as \\"Spider Man\\" to this one, that they are versetile and convincing actors.  This is a very touching and heartfelt movie, not to be missed for the accurate depiction of the damages and ravages of the worst form of human experience...killing others in the name of war!

B001CXWWBE|3.0|Quality NIC based on appearance and reviews. Based on this and other site's ratings and Intel specs I purchased as a cheap option to add 2nd NIC to Dell Server T110 (Server 2008R2.) I had to return as the hardware caused immediate issues including BSOD and memory parity errors. Intel's site offered drivers for this NIC compatible to Server 2008R2 x64 so it could be a Dell thing. Just thought I'd post to warn other Dell T110 Server owners searching for a compatible 2nd NIC that this is not the one to choose.

B00127RAJY|5.0|A little background info first, and then I'll go into my initial review. I'll be updating this review after I move up to each level (or as soon as I remember to update!).<br /><br />I am \\"obese,\\" although I don't really see myself that way (I've always been comfortable in my own skin). I know that I am extremely out of shape (even in my super-thin days, I was not an exerciser - I'm just lazy by nature!), and over the last year I have tried to bring my weight down (20+ lbs so far) and become more active.<br /><br />I started the 30 Day Shred with my friend several months ago. Both of us were enjoying it immensely, until we both got sick with hacking coughs, heavy congestion, and sinus issues. There was some crud going around that lasted MONTHS, not just days, and we were miserable for just over two months. Once we got better, we'd given up on the routine of exercise an also gotten busy with life again.<br /><br />However, during the 9 days I **did** complete the shred, I lost nearly 12 pounds. I didn't modify my diet very much - I only cut my calories every OTHER day, and I didn't cut them by very much.<br /><br />Fast forward to two weeks ago, when I decided to order the DVD so that I could Shred at home, alone. Getting together to do it when we didn't have 10 kids underfoot had become all but impossible (she's a mother of 5, plus she runs an in-home daycare).<br /><br />Instead of doing this alone and letting myself off the hook, I decided to propose a challenge to my friends and social networks alike. I wanted a group of us to do the Shred (or any other exercise) daily, and report back to one another. Today was the first official day of the 30 Day (Shred) Challenge, and even after just one day of Shred-ding again, I feel fabulous. I know I'm doing what my body, mind, and soul need ... and I also know I'm encouraging my friends to do something great for themselves too.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />Right now, I'm only on Level 1 of the 30 Day Shred. I love that it is a quick, intense workout, and I don't need anything more than a mat and some weights. Really, I could use a towel and household items, even if I didn't have the mat and weights.<br /><br />The workout utilizes circuit training, grouping different muscle exercises together, and a fast pace to keep you from getting bored or overdoing any one set of muscles. I find that Jillian's comments are right on target with how I'm feeling, and that she usually inserts a comment JUST when I'm feeling like I can't continue the current set.<br /><br />Obviously, everyone should check with their doctors before implementing any kind of exercise program ... but I highly recommend this one, even for those of us who are just starting out (and those of us who are obese!). There isn't anything too difficult to accomplish, even if you have to go slightly slower or modify your exercise a bit.ore than a mat and some weights.

I loved the fact they released rare remixes of Whenever You Need Somebody and if you can stand listening When You Gonna, you're in treat with rare remixes of this song.
1400063736|5.0|This is a novel of New York City, told in short stories that are linked through shared characters and a connection to Philippe Petit's 1974 real-life tightrope walk between the World Trade Center's Twin Towers. The stories interconnect and encounter characters in subsequent stories, all from different perspectives and with new revelations, the thoughts and observations of the spectators of Petit as he sets out to walk the tightrope between the Twin Towers in. This is such a wonderful, poignant weave of stories that somehow don't seem as complicated as it had to have been to write it.  This powerful writing makes perfect sense. Great emotions captured in a wonderful writing style that made the read a pleasure! Wonderful!
B001HN69B8|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever sat completely through.  I kept waiting for it to live up to all the hype that some reviewers gave it.  Sadly, amazon sent me 2 copies of this horrible flick.  I guess they thought that after pre-ordering the first one and mistakingly ordering it a second time I must have been a true fan.  I sent the first copy back and the second was sold on ebay the next day.  Please if you are thinking of watching this consider that you will never get these 2 hours back.  You could do so much more with your life rather than watch this strange film that I never could get a grip on.  Take my opinion for what it's worth but for me my money would be better spent elsewhere.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|While I love the show, my wife loves it even more.  So when her birthday came around I decided to go ahead and buy the whole thing for her.  Great Idea!  She LOVED it!    Then she opened the package.  The packaging is cheap brittle plastic and half of the disc holders broke in shipping.  The poster that was advertised on the page and even on the packaging was not included at all.  That's not even the bad part.  The discs are made with some kind of special copy protection, or they are made with some bad format that makes them unplayable in almost any DVD player.  My computer, laptop, XBOX, and DVD player all refuse to play the discs, and most of them don't even see the disc as a DVD.  So I thought maybe it was my equipment.  I took the discs around, not at my friends houses, not at work, nowhere do they play correctly except ONE player.  My PS3 actually plays them.  I checked and they are legit, straight from paramount with their fancy name and logo on the back of the disc on the center track so I know they aren't some kind of Korean burned copies.    I am truly disgusted here.  In an attempt to prevent people from making copies of something that has been already freely available on the internet for years before the product was released, these brainiacs at Paramount have made the product nearly worthless to LEGAL customers.  This makes me just want to go download the free copies off the web.  At least those will play on a standard DVD player...
B000002P74|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's second effort is a nice collection of songs that show their expanded versatile musical background. From blues to country to rock... these Westside Jacksonville, Florida bad boys can 'bring it' with the best of 'em. Showing from one song to the next how passionate they were with their music. Unfortunately, their career was but short-lived. The original (pre October 1977) Skynyrd is really the only line-up that I consider Skynyrd. The day Ronnie Van Zant died was the real 'Day the Music Died'. I truly miss that rebel songwriting genius. If you are interested in going back down memory lane with Skynyrd or you are just now getting exposure to this legendary band, you should visit their first three albums.                                                    Their first effort known as 'Pronounced'  The second offering known as 'Second Helping' and my personal favorite the third release 'Nuthin' Fancy'.   Now that's the Lynyrd Skynyrd that really reflects the true classic sound of this wonderful band.  I'll take 'seconds' on any of these three musical southern rock masterpieces anytime!!                                                By adding classic Lynyrd Skynyrd to your musical library, you can NEVER go wrong.                                              yours in music, Dennis B.                             Jax,Fl.

B0035WTE2U|5.0|In keeping with my now held preference that a Short Review is a Good Review, (unless it warrants something else),and after listening to this collection and watching the DVDs, I can state:-<br />This is not a greatest hits collection.<br />Why buy? Because the song selection is interesting although nothing new ( how many times do you get to hear,\\"Evil Walks\\",\\"Guns for Hire\\" \\"War Machine\\" and the previously difficult to get \\"Black Hearted Man\\",together on a disc with \\"If You Want Blood You've Got It\\" and a more than generous selection of vocals from Bon Scott, though);it represents the most appropriate songs to compliment the movie Iron Man 2 (no brainer);the collection covers a representative sample of the Band's history, both Brian and Bon;if you are interested in AC/DC for the first time and wonder what the hype is all about, a great place to start; AND it is consistently and still the benchmark for rock n roll, machine gun magazine emptying, blues power chords, beats that are simply the best.<br />Is it a sell out? Who cares!The band has been around since 1973 and has nothing to prove, An outstanding recent world tour behind them.For those that feel offended, my comment is, TOUGH!buy something else! If you like the music, (and who doesnt) and you dont have all the CDs or albums you could do a lot worse than add this to your Car CD player or party list for high rotation and to watch the true primal kings of Rock N Roll on DVD.<br />The suitability to the movie? Perfect choice. 5 stars out of 5.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD, as I'm home bound, and I couldn't go to the movie theatre to see it. Sure, I know there is supposed to be an even better version of the movie coming out in 3-D, and that it will have a lot more extra stuff on it, but for people like me who have been waiting to see even what the movie is like, I give it my own 2 thumbs up.    This movie is so brilliant! I love Sci-Fi movies, so this movie just blew my mind! I can't believe that they originally started working on the script for this movie in 1994, just waiting for technology to catch up with the ideas and vision of Mr. Cameron. I'm glad that they waited to do this film right. The colors in this movie are really amazing too. My parents got to see this movie in 3-D at an IMAX theatre. Neither of my parents like Fantasy movies, but my Mom just kept going on and on about this movie. If it looks this awesome on my old beat up TV, I can't even imagine how awesome it must have been in the theater's.    I give this movie, even without all the \\"Special Features\\" and everything, a full five star rating that the movie itself deserves! If you haven't seen it, you are really missing out on a special treat! My advice, see it as soon as you can!

0307278409|2.0|This is probably a good example of a book being published that has more to do with who the author is and what sort of books about what country are momentarily hot, as opposed to what the author actually writes. A Chinese young woman goes to London, meets a gay man and has an affair, moves in with him, does a quick trip throughout western Europe, and then and finally goes back to China. She learns to write better English during the year.  Yeah, that's about it, with some generally pointless and superficial events and comments on differences in the two societies framed by a structure of defining words at the beginning of each short. Do you believe a reserved Chinese woman would date gay man who has become, because of her evidently, suddenly interested in women? Isn't this one of the fantasies of some narratives, that a woman is so alluring that she turns gay men straight? I also didn't get a strong sense of who these people were except in the most generalized manner. To me the book felt over designed while the writing, well, here's an example of poor thinking or sloppiness that that for me sort of defines the entire book: On page 162 she learns the words 'Impressionist' and \\"Impressionism and writes, \\"Longest two words I have ever learned so far\\" at 13 letters each.  Well, actually on page 149, she writes in her journal the word \\"individualistic,\\" which has 15 letters. I also note here the main character uses a complicated verb form that she is unable to use in other parts of the book.  Yeah I'm sure it must be difficult to write about someone learning a language and to keep their learning and word usage consistent, I'll forgive her on that one.
B0000089FS|5.0|I bought this album way back in 1988 right after it was released & it is still one of my favorites today.  IMHO, it is not only one of the best from the 80's but also Elton's expansive catalog as well.  Alot of fans do tend to knock it becuz it sounds too 80's or becuz there's alot of synth or becuz it isn't up there with classic albums like &#34;Yellow Brick Road&#34;.  So does it have songs that measure up to epics like &#34;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&#34;?  Nope.  But what it does have is a strong set of songs with great lyrics, infectious melodies & also some hidden gems that never made it on the radio but probably could have.  Tracks like &#34;Town of Plenty&#34;, &#34;Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters (Part Two)&#34; & &#34;Goodbye Marlon Brando&#34; are very likable & fast paced pop tunes you will probably like the very first time you hear them.  Then, of course, you have the album's big hit &#34;I Don't Wanna Go on With You Like That&#34;.  A very catchy dance track with a nice rhythm to it.  My favorite track on the album is &#34;The Camera Never Lies&#34;.  It is a very catchy mid-tempo number that kind of sounds a little like Elton's future hit - &#34;Healing Hands&#34; and just like that song it has great percussion, piano, synth & a nice chorus as well.  It's a shame it wasn't released as a radio single cuz I think it could've charted fairly well if given the chance. The ballads on the album are also top notch.  The best being the elegant single - &#34;A Word In Spanish&#34;.  Definitely one of Elton's best songs. I also enjoyed the quiet but atmospheric &#34;Japanese Hands&#34; & the album's closer &#34;Since God Invented Girls&#34; which is a tribute not only to beautiful women but also the Beach Boys and as it turns out, they showed up to provide their trademark harmony b/g vocals on the song. The other tracks are also pretty good & sometimes even quite humorous if you listen to the vocals closely.<br /><br />As far as this re-release goes, there are 4 previously unreleased tracks.  The first is &#34;Rope Around A Fool&#34;  & it has a nice bluesy New Orleans style piano that kind of reminds me of Dr. John. There are also 2 re-mixes of &#34;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&#34; & &#34;Mad Hatters 2&#34; which are interesting but much inferior to the originals. The re-mix of &#34;I don't wanna&#34; is a typical dance/hip-hop style re-mix that is much longer than the original (7:17) & is also sped up somewhat.  The re-mix of &#34;Mad Hatters&#34; is very similar in style it & clocks in at (6:19).  The highlight from the new songs, though, is the stripped down jazzier version of &#34;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&#34;. It's still a fast song but all you hear is Elton on the piano with some nice b/g vocals & it is very intimate (think Unplugged).  I almost like it better than the original & i'm not even a big fan of stripped down music.<br /><br />As for the re-mastering, it is definitely an improvement over the original sound but only somewhat. The biggest difference being a much punchier bass & slightly louder volume.  So if you already own this album, it's not a night & day difference but if you love this album as much as I do or wanna hear the new tracks, it's def worth the double dip.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is one of Elton's best albums & it deserves much more respect than it typically gets. A joy from beginning to end & you would be hard pressed not to find at least a few tracks here that are really enjoyable.previously unreleased tracks.

0060557818|5.0|I first read this book a few years ago. I asked a friend, a manager of a bookstore, what her favourite books or authors were to expand upon my reading list. She recommended Stardust and Neverwhere, both by Neil Gaiman. Both became quick favourites though very different, and both had a lasting impression on me. This book is dark and disturbing; it mixes high fantasy with modern day woes. It is the story of Richard Mayhew, an office worker in London who meets a girl named Door, and suddenly his whole world is turned upside down. He discovers London Below, a place of enchantment, magic, and mythic creatures. He has been called upon to be Door's hero. Door's whole family has been murdered and when Richard encounters her, she has been injured. Just by stopping and paying attention to her, he is sucked into her world, and slowly drifts away from what we would call reality. This book is richly thrilling and full of detail. You will never think of London the same way again. And maybe never look at a street person the same way again either.

B000B0WODA|4.0|Music is so subjective and personal, so I don't know how helpful reviews can really be... After listening to a couple of Franz Ferdinand albums and seeing them in public I always had the feeling that I was missing on one... But which one? For me this is \\"it\\"; love the guitar riffs, very \\"pop\\", but I'm one of those that actually listens to the lyrics, and when you do, you find they have some bite... Plus there's the whole \\"music is a language in itself\\" and Franz Ferdinand seems to touch on specific notes...
0385504225|2.0|A pretty bad book.  I enjoyed Dan Brown's previous books which were silly but fun, but this book felt like he did not have many ideas so was trying to fill space as much as possible.  Repeated instances where he dragged out the reveals pretty ridiculously, using the same verbal formulas over and over again.  Also, really needed some editing, both for length and for details.  For example, a knife which is descried several times as having an iron blade and a bone handle is once described as an obsidian knife.  This is a little baffling to me.
0061564893|4.0|I live near the District of Columbia, where there is a large marble fountain commemorating Christopher Columbus.  Columbus Day is a federal holiday.  All of these things venerate a man who pioneered nothing.  Columbus has had 500 years of fantastic P.R.    Menzies has done an excellent job compiling evidence that leads to the conclusion that China navigated to, landed on, charted, and possibly colonized the New World long before Europeans even knew there was a New World.  This book challenges the assumptions we take for granted about our own history. Contrary to what some reviewers are saying, Menzies' theory is neither whacky nor half-baked.  He seriously attempts to answer questions that have been left unanswered for too long.  While some of the evidence is stronger than others, taken on the whole, the argument is compelling and worthy of serious consideration by not just the general public but also academics.  The history establishment really dropped the ball on this one, leaving it to a retired submarine commander to publish the theory.    Many other reviewers have correctly criticized his methods and some of his conclusions.  (I specifically find his evidence based on plants and animals to be extremely thin.  The mylodon has been extinct for 10,000 years.)  However, it does not undermine the fact that we are stuck in a Eurocentric view of the age of discovery.  Even if only half of what Menzies documents turns out to be true, we will need to seriously reconsider the conventional historical timeline.    It is time to dispose of the myth of Christopher Columbus \\"discovering\\" America.  \\"Brave and determined though they were,\\" says Menzies, \\"Columbus,...Magellan, Cook and the rest of the European explorers set sail with maps showing the way to their destinations.\\"  Maps, Menzies cliams, drawn from information gathered by the Chinese. Real history usually turns out to be the cumulative effort of the many rather than the heroic effort of the one.  And convenient as the Columbus story is, it is a fable posing as history.  I for one find the idea of hundreds of ships carrying thousands of men making discoveries more believable than one man leading three little boats into the supposedly unknown.    Menzies is a navigator, so he knows maps.  You have to give him credit for what he does know, rather than bash him for what he doesn't.
B0034G4OWM|1.0|\\"For centuries now, man has done everything he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: Clear-cutting forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere, over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying wetlands and aquifers. So when nature strikes back, and smacks him on the head ... I enjoy that. I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None.\\"  - George Carlin from his standup special \\"Life is Worth Losing\\"    Given this depressingly nihilistic viewpoint, there's a good chance Carlin would have enjoyed \\"Furry Vengeance,\\" not only because nature strikes back, but also because it strikes in the most unbelievably juvenile and inane ways. He always did enjoy excess. I'm sure he would have laughed each time Brendan Fraser found himself in a car full of skunks, which spray him in amounts so vast, the car appears to be filled with fog. And what about the scene where he gets trapped in a port-o-potty, which is tossed around by a bear until it ends up in a tree, and is then found the next morning and opened by a construction crew? We don't see Fraser in that shot, but the shock on everyone else's face tells us everything we need to know. Oh yes. I'm sure Carlin would have loved that. Nature struck back. Man got what he deserved.    But enough about Carlin. Let's talk about Fraser, who's not only the star of \\"Furry Vengeance\\" but is also one of the executive producers. What was it about this project that prompted him to get it financed? Did he enjoy the jokes that were stretched beyond the breaking point despite not being funny to begin with? Did he relish the idea of humiliating himself on the screen, as when his character finds himself without clothing and is forced to wear his wife's pink sweats, the pants of which have the words \\"yum yum\\" written on the rear end? Perhaps he was blindsided by the film's message of saving the environment and being kind to our woodland friends. Of course, it's a very good, very relevantmessage, and I support it wholeheartedly. But there's nothing to be gained by sending it in this particular way. Activism should be encouraged through facts; it should not be at the mercy of filmmakers with four-year-old mentalities.    This is a desperately unfunny movie - so unfunny that it doesn't even inspire incredulous laughter. It's an idiotic family comedy so contrived, goofy, broad, sappy, and strained that watching it is downright painful. It makes not the slightest effort in the ways of characterization, plot, or even basic entertainment. Fraser plays Dan Sanders, a Chicago real estate developer; he and his family have moved into a forest community, where he can oversee the construction of homes in an area teeming with wildlife. His wife, Tammy (Brooke Shields), and teenage son, Tyler (Matt Prokop), were happier in Chicago and spend the entire movie making him feel terrible. This is especially true of Tyler, who sulks and back-talks before meeting his school's student librarian (Skyler Samuels) and becoming an environmental activist.    Naturally, the animals that live in the forest aren't too happy about what Sanders is taking part in. But then a raccoon gets wind of the second phase of development, conceived of by Sanders' condescending boss, Neal Lyman (Ken Jeong): A forest themed shopping mall. And because Sanders caves in to Lyman's demands, the raccoon and his legion of woodland creatures declare war on him. Thus begins a series of scenes in which animals of all sorts do everything they can to make his life a living hell. Some tactics are more psychological, like a bird that repeatedly taps on his bedroom window as he tries to sleep. Strange that Tammy is unable to hear it; she is, after all, in the same room as her husband. Other tactics are physical - punching, clawing, urinating, biting, stealing his clothes, and even feats of pure fantasy, such as when the raccoon and a family of skunks hotwire his car and go on a joyride. In the end, he alwaysends up embarrassing himself, especially in front of his family, who, of course, think he's going crazy.    In between moments of moronic slapstick are throwaway gags that have no business being in the movie. Take, for example, an obnoxious security guard (Alexander Chase) who appears at Tammy's doorstep every time her husband goes missing; he's always disappointed whenever Sanders reappears because he no longer has any reason to accuse Tammy of murder. And then there's Mrs. Martin, the elderly schoolteacher (Alice Drummond); when Tammy begins coordinating an annual forest festival, Mrs. Martin enthusiastically remembers that she loves painting pinecones. That's about the only thing she remembers. Ha ha, the old woman is going senile.    Oh, what an awful movie. Who thought making it was a good idea? Who read the screenplay and found it funny? Who deluded themselves into believing that it was appropriate for children? Judging by the fact that no child or adult in the audience laughed, it seems \\"Furry Vengeance\\" was made with no one in mind - save, maybe, for bitter misanthropes who get a thrill from watching animals get back at their two-legged oppressors. Why was Fraser involved with it? Is he at a point now where he's artistically bankrupt? \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and \\"Extraordinary Measures\\" were no masterpieces, but they were a lot better than this. Why was Shields involved? Is she not more established? Such a mystery.

B002RD4UZ4|5.0|I've heard on the radio on the Smooth Jazz station the song that captured me with the very first sound of an unknown singer's voice, with the  melancholic yet catchy and rhythmic melody and with undeniable class. It kept happening over and over; I would turn on the radio, the song would play but never from the beginning and I could not get the title and the name of the performer. The one phrase kept repeating over and over, Oh Lord, Who Will Comfort Me? When it happened again this morning on my way to work, I finally did the Internet search on the phrase and come up with the name and the bitter-sweet story of Melody Gardot. The horrifying car accident that had caused her at the age of 19 the terrible injuries and the prospect to spend the rest of her life bedridden or paralyzed from waste down, eventually turned her to writing and performing songs as the part of her therapy. As the result, a captivating, unique, and infinitely attractive new artist has entered the music scene of our times. I've became a fan instantly and I am listening to every song of Melody I was able to find on YouTube. Many of them are from the CD My One and Only Thrill.  Of all songs I've heard so far, my favorites are the very first I heard, Who Will Comfort Me? and  Your Heart Is As Black As Night - a quintessential sensual  soft jazz composition, written, it seems, especially for the scene in a nostalgic noir movie.  The vocals, piano, drums and wind instruments talk among themselves independently and then merge elegantly in the meditation on memory and regrets of love gone wrong.<br /><br />Melody (what a beautiful and suitable name for her) is here to stay. She is not just talented, she possesses a rare class, taste, and sensuality that excites you, caresses and soothes you at the same time. She has been compared to the jazz/rock/blues singers of the past and present, such as Nina Simone, Diana Krall and Nora Jones but there is something so special about her, sexy and sweet and comforting at the same time that I believe she will not pale in comparison with the famous and beloved singers. She is very young and I look forward to her new songs, CDs, and the concerts. I would love to attend her live performance. I want nothing to be between me and the voice that Will Comfort Me.same time that I believe she will not pale in comparison with the famous and beloved singers.

B0035WTJFW|5.0|Along with at least ninety-five percent of the American population, I'm a huge fan of Steven Spielberg's work. With that in mind, to see both \\"Minority Report\\" and [[ASIN:B0035WTJBG \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"]] released on Blu-Ray within mere weeks of each other was quite thrilling indeed! Much as with the \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" release, I was very pleased with the film transfer of \\"Minority Report\\". Due to the darker overall palette of colors within the film, it's not quite a benchmark of the format, but there is a remarkable sheen of clarity and level of detail that clearly sets it vastly apart from the DVD.<br /><br />On the first disc, the film runs 2:25:15 and features audio and subtitles in English, French, Spanish (there are no features on the first disc). Prior to the menu loading is an easily skipped trailer for the long overdue home video release of \\"The African Queen\\", which truly does look amazing on Blu, though the standard definition trailer doesn't do it justice. But I digress.<br /><br />Whereas \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was somewhat of a disappointment in the special features department, \\"Minority Report\\" hits a stellar home run (if you'll excuse my completely out-of-place baseball idiom). On the second disc, there are eight brand new features created exclusively for this Blu-Ray release (in high definition), along with all of the original DVD features ported over (in standard definition). The first eight features listed are the new ones, with the five below them being the ones ported over from the DVD. Most of the titles are rather self-explanatory, but a complete rundown of the features is below:<br /><br />1) \\"The Future According to Spielberg\\" (34:03) -  This is an \\"extended interview\\" with Spielberg filmed on the eve of the film's theatrical release. The feature will prompt the user during playback of the interview to view storyboards, concept art, various interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage and photographs - mostly culled from the other features on the disc. It's structured similar to the \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" seen on recent Warner Bros. releases, with the notable difference of not having the film itself playing in the background (Spielberg is known for his dislike of commentary tracks). Parts of this feature are in high definition, while some parts are not. According to the case, this requires a \\"BonusView-enabled\\" Blu-Ray player.<br /><br />2) \\"Inside the World of Pre-Crime\\" (10:11) - This is a sort of faux documentary on the pre-crime unit. It's a fun feature, as it dives a bit deeper into the whole mythos of the idea.<br /><br />3) \\"Phillip K. Dick, Steven Spielberg and Minority Report\\" (14:18) - This features Dick's daughter and others discussing his life and works, in addition to commenting on how they felt about Spielberg bringing Dick's story to celluloid.<br /><br />4) \\"Minority Report: Future Realized\\" (6:22) - A brief feature on the technology the pre-crime unit utilizes, including interesting information on the \\"spacial operating environment\\" seen in the film.<br /><br />5) \\"Minority Report: Props of the Future (9:43) - This features production designer Alex McDowell who opens by noting that Spielberg keeps vast amounts of memorabilia from his films. McDowell goes through some of the props and says a few words about them.<br /><br />6) \\"Highlights from Minority Report: From the Set\\" - This is a two part feature with McDowell speaking about two of the unique action setpieces within the film, which includes \\"The Hoverpack Sequence\\" (6:06) \\"The Car Factory Sequence\\" (2:57).<br /><br />7) \\"Minority Report: Commercials of the Future\\" (3:55) - McDowell speaks about how the crew went about creating the unique in-film product advertisements and promotions.<br /><br />8) \\"Previz Sequences\\" - This is a two part feature which compares the primitive computerized storyboards to the finished product, which includes \\"Hoverpack Sequence Previz\\" (2:10) and \\"Maglev Escape Previz\\" (1:43).<br /><br />The following features are ported over from the original DVD release and are all in standard definition. It's this pulling together of the old DVD features with new high definition ones that truly makes the Blu-Ray upgrade well worth it.<br /><br />1) \\"From Story to Screen\\" - Another two part feature including \\"The Story/The Debate\\" (9:36), a good feature discussing the development of the film, and \\"The Players\\" (9:27) a rundown of the principle characters within the film as presented by the actors who played them.<br /><br />2) \\"Deconstructing Minority Report\\" - This is a five part feature which includes \\"The World of Minority Report - An Introduction\\" (9:21), which focuses on the pre-production elements of the film, including the unique \\"think tank\\" Spielberg brought together to brainstorm over ideas of the future. \\"Precrime and Precogs\\" (8:20) has information on the production design of the film with special emphasis on the precogs set with some good behind the scenes footage. \\"The Spyder Sequence\\" (5:24) is about the design and implementation of those creepy robotic spiders within the film. \\"Precog Visions\\" (4:51) has Spielberg and some of the crew discussing the ideas behind their creation of the precog visions. \\"Vehicles of the Future\\" (5:10) has the crew talking about the conceptual design of the cars in the film.<br /><br />3) The Stunts - A series of brief features about some of the more interesting stunt scenes in the film, including \\"Maglev Escape\\" (2:58), \\"Hoverpack Chase\\" (3:00), and \\"Car Factory\\" (2:48).<br /><br />4) \\"ILM and Minority Report\\" - A series of five brief features on the combination of practical effects and stuntwork along with the computer generated effects within the film, which begins with an \\"Introduction\\" (4:31) with Cruise. \\"Holograms\\" (3:09) focuses on the ideas behind the holographic cameras used within the film. \\"Hall of Containment\\" (3:09) discusses the production design of the prison with the fancy name. \\"Maglev\\" (3:12) is yet another piece about those cool cars that drive themselves. \\"Hovercraft and Hoverpacks\\" (3:08) features the ideas behind the designs of those awesome devices we all wish we had. \\"Cyber Parlor\\" (1:54) is about that bizarre virtual reality escapist club briefly seen in the film.<br /><br />5) \\"Final Report\\" (3:58) - A bookend piece for the special features which has Cruise and Spielberg adding a few closing statements about the film.<br /><br />Also included is a massive picture gallery called \\"Production Concepts\\" which features production drawings, models, and photographs divided into eight sub-sections: \\"Precrime\\", \\"Hovership\\", \\"Hoversuit\\", \\"Hall of Containment\\", \\"Spyders\\", \\"City Apartment\\", \\"Greenhouse Plants\\", and \\"Objects\\". The \\"Storyboard Sequences\\" features easily navigated storyboards divided into three sub-sections: \\"Maglev Sequence\\", \\"Alley Chase\\", and \\"Car Factory\\". Rounding out the special features are three trailers in high definition.<br /><br />\\"Minority Report\\" is a pitch perfect example of how a Blu-Ray release should be presented, particularly an 'older' film making its Blu debut. The high detail visuals and overall sheen of clarity to the film print, along with the wealth of brand new high definition special features, makes this an easy and beneficial double dip for those, such as myself, who've owned the DVD release for years now. With this film receiving the red carpet treatment and \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" only receiving a good-but-not-great release, it's impossible to gauge how future Spielberg films (such as \\"Artificial Intelligence: AI\\") will be presented on Blu.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|If you're a fan of Blade Runner, 2001, Silent Running, Outland, Alien, and the countless other dystopian sci-fi films that relied more heavily on ideas than laser guns, this is your flick. Sam Rockwell give's the performance(s) of his career. As a directorial debut, Jones knocks it out of the park. My one minor gripe was Kevin Spacey, who voiced a Hal 9000 type computer: IMHO Spacey phoned it in with a performance that was less homage to Hal and more a cheap copy. But that aside, Moon is a great movie.
B0000027KU|5.0|Originally released in 1968, as this the the band's out-standing debut album.

Here, you get the lp's ten tracks + eight added bonus cuts. Featured the all-too short lived line-up: Jeff Beck - guitar & arrainger, Rod Stewart - vocals, Ron Wood - bass, Nicky Hopkins - keyboards & piano and Aynsley Dunbar - drums. Guest players include Keith Moon, Mickey Waller, Mickey Most, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and others. Highly recommended.

Obviously, it is too simple for those with a physics background, but for those who merely have an interest, without the background it can be helpful-I would almost recommend it as a supplimental textbook for an intro to physics book, makes me wish I had had this type of book when i was in college.
0307463745|4.0|Prior to reading Rework, I was unfamiliar with Jason Fried, David Heinemeier Hansson, or their company 37signals. One book, however, provides the reader with the insight into the attitudes of the founders and a basis for the reasons for their success. However, if you subscribe to \\"conventional wisdom,\\" this book may not be for you. The authors tend go against your experience and what has been instilled into you during your college and graduate work. Nonetheless, this is a worthwhile book, even if you work for a large company. Many of the ideas presented can be used in a small group setting.     Contents: Introduction; First; Takedowns; Go; Progress; Productivity; Competitors; Evolution; Promotion; Hiring; Damage Control; Culture; Conclusion; Resources; Acknowledgements     Each of the major chapters are broken down into topics, which are only a few pages each. As an example, the chapter on Competitors has topics on \\"Don't Copy,\\" \\"Decommoditize your product,\\" \\"Pick a fight,\\" \\"Underdo your competition,\\" and \\"Who cares what they're doing?\\" The topic on \\"Don't copy\\" tells the reader that while copying a competitors product is a good way to learn, in the business world it is usually bad. Copying a product puts you and your company behind the company that originally created it. You forego the knowledge of actually creating something, you miss the reasons why it is the way that it is, and you will never catch up. You are in a reactive mode.    Every chapter is laid out in a similar fashion; A major heading and several key points that drive the idea home. It is a very effective teaching tool for the reader. Instead of wasting time to get to the \\"good parts,\\" Rework is all \\"good parts.\\" There is no filler; Fried and Heinemeier Hansson are very direct. The book is listed as having 277 pages, however not all of it is stocked with words. Rather, they make liberal use of graphics, which removes probably 100 pages of text. You could probably finish the book in a couple of hours.Despite that, the lessons and philosophies that they impart will stay with you.    While all of the lessons cannot be applied to every business, especially large organizations, many of them are applicable to every organization. Some of the lessons are shown on the back cover: ASAP is poison, meetings are toxic, fire the workaholics, planning is guessing. One of the lessons that is needed, but rarely used is \\"Interruption is the enemy of productivity.\\" All day long you are bombarded with e-mail, instant messages, phone calls, chatty colleagues. You lose productivity. So, what happens? You stay late, you work when you get home, you spend part of your weekend \\"catching up.\\" The authors recommend \\"alone time.\\" Set aside specific time every day just for you; no e-mail, no instant messaging, no phones, no talking. During this time, you have an unbroken period where you can actually get your work done. During the work day. Imagine that! This isn't so far fetched, either. There are people that refuse to answer e-mail between 10AM and 2PM, or only at set times during the day. Others close their instant messaging software for a few hours. All of these people have one thing in common, they want, need, and have the ability to create \\"alone time.\\"    Open-minded managers would do well to give some thought to the lessons contained in Rework, it has the opportunity to make your team much more effective, productive, and valuable. Small business owners; this could be your Bible. Highly recommended.    Disclosure:   Obtained from: Friend   Payment: Free
B003FSTN5C|3.0|To start with I am a fan of JAG and NCIS and this review will be spoiler free.  I have watched probably 90% of both shows and when I heard about the spinoff and saw the teaser episode in NCIS I was intrigued enough to give LA a chance.  I should point out that I went into NCIS LA knowing that Bellisario was not working directly with it and this was going to be a different show than NCIS.  Basically I went in hoping for another show to watch and enjoy.  I can't say that really happened.      First off we have plenty of actors with experience under their belts and crime drama with cool new technology....  Too bad the plots, back-story, and character interactions are flubbed with great abandon.  Chris O'Donnell, who acts as G. Callen, plays a very interesting character with some depth and his \\"partner\\" LL Cool J, who acts as Sam Hanna, also comes across well... but it falls flat when they interact as friends and I don't really see much chemistry.  Things feel strained all over and scenes get stretched far too many times.  When they brought Director Vance in for two episodes I seriously was wondering where the plot went and was sorely disturbed to see that while the actors were good at portraying themselves they were bad at interacting with one another.  From the pyschologist to the computer nerd I saw fleshed out characters but it was like the actors could not bring them to life around the other characters.  Linda Hunt was really the only character I liked and that was mostly from nostalgia.  Now someone who enjoys the show will say that with time these things will work themselves out... but half a season later I am still seeing bad plots and character interaction.  There were times when characters would literally walk on que into a scene JUST as they were about to be talked about or announced like the stork brought them.     NCIS was tighter and moved better.  I realize that stereotypes are unavoidable in tv shows, and the original NCIS certainly has many, but I can no longer see some of the characters beyond that.  Besides Sam, Hetty, and Callen the other characters are the pyschologist, computer nerd, rookie, and eye candy ( tho she has surprised me on a few occasions ).  That's pretty sad in general but worse for a show I want to keep watching.  Because I really did want to keep watching NCIS LA but in the end there really isn't much difference than what you would get with NCIS or another crime drama.  NCIS worked because it was quirky and had interesting characters, even if it did become way too formulaic.  And when NCIS could pull some amazing story archs it kept you watching the mediocre ones.  I think NCIS LA brought too much stereotypical quirky and not enough cohesion.    Pile all this on with unrealistic plots and plot devices and I found it very hard to suspend my disbelief while watching the show.  It had its moments here and there but in the end I stopped watching this entirely.      I recommend renting this before you buy it.  You should be able to tell in a few episodes if this will be for you.  I gave this half a season to catch my interest and it failed but some may still find this enjoyable if they can look past the flaws.
B001ILHY1I|3.0|Hollywood is well-known for trotting out the big and mindless action films and &#34;Death Race&#34; is certainly no different, in that regard. The basics of the plot are a pretty well-traveled affair and none of the actors does any real stretching beyond their character's needs. From Joan Allen's &#34;ballbuster&#34; warden, to Jason Statham's &#34;hard-ass&#34; hero, to Ian McShane's &#34;Yoda-like&#34; veteran inmate, nothing new, innovative or different is brought out.<br /><br />Of course, no one really sees films like this for deep and meaningful performances. It's all about the action and this one gives you plenty of it. The car battles are done exceedingly well. You actually feel like you are in the vehicle, as the action unfolds. The stunts on the track are pretty much what you expect. If you like to watch fast cars and big explosions, this film will not fail you.<br /><br />One of the things that's interesting about this film, is exactly how it is connected to Roger Corman's cult classic &#34;Death Race 2000.&#34; Originally, this was to be a sequel, with futuristic floating cars, like out of &#34;Back to the Future Part II,&#34; but the expense forced that to be changed. The film's writer/director, Paul W.S. Anderson, has said that this is meant as a prequel to Corman's film, but since this takes place AFTER the time period of it, I find that hard to swallow.<br /><br />So, for myself, I see it as an updated remake, which I normally find very putrid, since most remakes are of films that are already good on their own. But &#34;Death Race&#34; is of that rare breed, where the remake can be taken on it's own and enjoyed, without it being disrespectful to the previous version. Something made much easier, by the guest voicing of (the late) David Carradine as &#34;Frankenstein&#34; (the same character he played in Corman's classic original).<br /><br />So, while &#34;Death Race&#34; isn't a film that will leave you pondering deep philosophical questions about life and humanity, it manages to pack in plenty of thrills and action that one comes to expect of the typical summer flick. It's simply big, dumb fun and very re-watchable! What every action blockbuster aspires to be. It is sure to appeal to the 14-year old in every guy.fe and humanity, it manages to pack in plenty of thrills and action that one comes to expect of the typical summer flick. It's simply big, dumb fun and very re-watchable! What every action blockbuster aspires to be. It is sure to appeal to the 14-year old in every guy.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie really got me hooked on Maggie Gyllenhaal.  First movie I had ever seen with her, then seen she popped up in Donnie Darko, and the branched out from there.  The Secretary is a delightful movie that brings sadomasochism (not BDSM as some folk on here seem to imply) to the mainstream in a well done not pornographic not dark very fun movie.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I liked this movie. I thought it was really good. I have not read any Holmes stories, so I cannot state whether it strays from the spirit of these stories or not. I just cannot offer an opinion whether the representations are true to the books or not. But, I am not willing to say that movie is not worth watching because it is very, very entertaining and well done. It is filled with action and thoughtfulness, which makes it an unusually smart action movie. I appreciate this and wish more people would make such movies. At any rate, get this movie and be entertained for an evening.
1552091090|1.0|We just had \\"Grandfriend's Day\\" at school. I was feeling overly emotional, since my Mom (the Grandmom) was too weak to walk and could not attend, and I (the parent) had to go in her place so my son would not be the only one to not have a \\"Grandfriend\\" present-i.e., a grandparent, (aunt, uncle, parent, etc. if no grandparents are still living or well).  This book was the closing reading in a big auditorium, and read by a sweet, good-hearted educator who happens to LOVE this book-So in this big auditorium, full of grandparents, \\"grandfriends\\" and 2nd grade students, like my son, this book was read out loud. We were seated so far away from the front microphone, we could not see the illustrations, but the text sounded strange. Sure, the constant repetition of \\"love you forever, etc.\\" is a beautiful statement of unconditional love (and I agree with those sentiments as a Mom); however, how depressing how this sentiment is then applied. By the end of the reading, I was crying, and fighting back tears. This story conjured up feelings of loss, not eternal love... I missed loved ones. like my Mother-in-Law who is deceased. And then I recalled the death of my father as a child, and never having \\"living\\" grandparents growing up, and thought of all \\"the loss\\" and pain, kids who are in foster care feel because their parents are dead or absent.  Since, I could not see the book, it only sounded creepy. But After reading the reviews of this book, I saw a copy at the library-and Yes I saw the illustrations. I have to agree with other reviewers that gave one-star, the pictures are remarkably odd and disturbing to me.   I did not realize the baby was a girl at the end of the book. This book in English is really quite off,strange, and it is hard to believe it's a warm, comforting, or reassuring story for anyone.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|This is a great movie. It is smart, gritty, tough, funny, and sexy, which is hard to believe that it is a Guy Ritchie movie. Its more of criminals trying outsmart everyone, but not quite pulling it off The stupidity of all their efforts cause a spiral of unintended events, where the real story is found. You see how, despite their best efforts, the characters are just lucky to muddle through their lives. In the end, this is a great movie. One worth watching again and again.
0971407614|5.0|Just started using this exercise book and being a 50 year old woman found the excercises not only easy to use but am noticeing faster results than my old regimine at the gym where I was using the equipment.  I have more time being able to do them at home which is a big plus in my busy schedule.
0307460444|5.0|I have had great success with every recipe I have tried from this book. My favorite so far is the Tiramisu cupcake!!! Would definitely  recommend this book for people who are willing to take the time to read the recipes over a couple times before diving in and have the patience for the more complex recipes. If you do...you'll be sweetly rewarded!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|This series keeps getting better with some outstanding stories, interesting people, and some twists that make the good Doctor a bit more mysterious.  Well directed, acted, filmed, a most enjoyable experience.
1423101472|5.0|It is by far the best of the series. Action packed,exciting and very captivating.It was the best ending for the series. I finished reading it in 2 days,that how good it is.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Yes I like this album, yes I listened to the lyrics but don't listen to it if you have any minors in the room.  Also you might want to be a little choosy on the songs you choose to listen to when there are women and maybe even if you are with your parents because some songs especially \\"Kill You\\", \\"kim\\" and \\"Criminal\\" have some very violent content and sound effects.  I would recommend the very conservative person to stay away from this one.  I myself was not able to listen to the album until I moved out on my own but I do say Eminem has got a point and reason for writing the lyrics.  If you listen to \\"Kim\\" enough and dig a little deeper on Em you will see that he was very P'd off at his ex.  But we'd rather he just write it down and record his emotions than the alternative.  Same thing with \\"Kill You\\" as violent and explicit as the song is, he is using his freedom of expression to express how he feels.  I guess we should take Eminem's lyrics with a grain of salt a little bit.  However if you think this album is too much, go ahead and take it to the dump.  But if you give it a listen a few times maybe you may see that he was going through a lot of anger at the time.  He was mad at his mother, wife and probably the whole world.  If you have little children listen to it when they're not around or wait to download or buy it but do listen to this album before you leave this earth.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen. Makes you think. It is not for kid's or meth heads. Walt does what he thinks he needs to do for his family when he is gone.
0312360266|1.0|I teach junior high students and have noticed many of my students bringing this book to my classroom.  Since I like to read what they read to stay current, I borrowed the first 4 books from a friend and proceeded to read them all.  I cannot express how disappointed I am in this series.  To begin with, this is not great literature.  I don't think anyone who picks up this book expects it to be particularly insightful or awe-inspiring, but it's a letdown of even modest expectations.  I enjoyed the Twilight series and expected this to be similarly written.  However, I was mistaken.  It lacks a complex story line, and I couldn't care less about any of the characters.  They are all so stereotypical and predictable as to be unlikable.  I can't imagine how these books were ever approved for publication.  The amount of editing errors is atrocious.  My main complaint, however, is the content.  If you don't want to read about sex, profanity, and violence, these books are not for you.  If you are a Christian or are remotely sympathetic to family values and conservative ideas, you will most likely be uncomfortable around such blatantly negative stereotypes regarding Christianity.  Wiccan influences are dominantly seen as good and enlightened, whereas Christians are countrified, stern hypocrites.  I suggest the authors themselves should be a bit more englighted and more tolerant of readers who maintain high moral standards.  As a teacher, I feel it is a shame for another teacher to write such trash and market it for a teen audience.  She should be upholding higher academic standards.
193413712X|4.0|The best reason I could think of for this book winning a Pulitzer Prize is the way it compares to the Pulitzer-Prizewinning Gilead. In Gilead, a man discovers who he is late in life by looking backwards and forwards at the men in his lineage. Tinkers is more ambitious than Gilead. Tinkers deliberately blows apart the linear narrative of generations to explore the ways in which our ancestors live inside us.    The first section of the book is chaotic: George Crosby, who is dying at home surrounded by family, experiences a patchwork of memories, hallucinations, fears, and real perceptions. The author contrasts George's experience with his lifelong attempt to create an ordered life. Metaphor piles upon metaphor showing us what things meant to George. This section is difficult to read, as the author changes writing styles frequently, leaping from level to level within George's consciousness. Thus, it is difficult for us to know who George is, and to care about him.    The second section is much more linear. We learn why order is important to George. His father Howard was a tinker and a door to door salesman whose heart loved poetry, and whose epilepsy made him unpredictable and frightening. George's grandfather was a minister who wasted away with mental and physical illness.    The third section appears linear, but is actually quite allusive. The boundaries between experiences begin to blur again. Is Howard recalling that he lost sight of his father, as the linear narrative suggests, or is this really a description of George's inner experience? Does George really meet his father again, or are pieces of himself coming together? Did we not know George at first because he did not know himself, masking these many painful memories with his sense of order?     Asking these questions about George and ourselves is the payoff of the book.    Paul Harding writes stunningly beautiful paragraphs, and is master of a variety of writing styles.  But the real magic of the book lies inthe complexity of the weave. Transitions and juxtapositions are awkward at times, but I think that is part of the message.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Yes, there are no special features on this Blu-ray disc, just the movie along with a DVD copy.  Not surprisingly, the blu-ray version is quite a bit better than the DVD standard definition version, even when the standard definition version is up-converted via a Blu-ray player.  Too, this is one of the best blu-ray movies I have seen - some blu-ray movies are not as clear and crisp. I like having a DVD copy, since I live alone and am the only one in the family with a Blu-ray player, I can let other family members borrow it to watch.<br /><br />On the Blu-ray version one is warned that a firmware upgrade to their Blu-ray player may be necessary in order to play it.  It worked fine on my VIZIO model VBR110 Blu-ray player but I have seen complaints that some older players will not play Avatar without the firmware upgrade.<br /><br />Anyway, those wanting more Avatar content may want to wait for the special edition or collector version to be released.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Apparently it wasn't enough to stupify Star Wars. LucasArts had to resurrect Indiana Jones and ruin him too. This movie is TERRIBLE!    The old mysticism, historical intrigue, intelligent humor and charming characterization is completely absent from this stinking rehash. There is only a pablum mixture of trite, childish dialogue, overused and outdated cliches, lousy acting, and a plot that seems to blend the most banal elements of \\"Da Vinci Code\\" with \\"The X-Files.\\" I am angry that I had to pay for this with actual money. Enough said?    Addendum: In fairness, the actors did their best with awful lines. And Ford has such screen presence, it's always a pleasure to see him in action. I just hope his next project has more substance.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|If what everyone is saying is true, I will just wait for the next release. I know the goal of a business is to make money, but it's still frustrating that they would pull this kind of thing with a movie like Avatar. Practically everyone on the planet bought a ticket to see this, how about not trying to squeeze more cash from fans by releasing one edition, and then a few months later release the \\"super super special\\" edition. Just release one disc and be done with it. Let me guess, the super duper version will come out around Christmas time. Just a guess
B0011NVCSO|5.0|I've had the cd for such a long time,<br />finally decided to get the vinyl last year.<br />Oh... such a wonderful album.<br />Definitely a must for music lovers.
0756405890|4.0|I haven't read a lot of fantasy since I was in high school, but this book had a lot of recommendations that made it sound like the best fantasy novel ever written or something.<br /><br />Let me say that this novel is pretty good. If you like fantasy novels, you'll probably like it. I've also read the author's blog, and he seems like a cool guy who's worth supporting.<br /><br />But don't be like me and go into it with inflated expectations, or you may be disappointed. This isn't some literary masterpiece or anything. It plays some fun games with structure and has a strong, well-realized voice. But in the end, it's a pretty standard \\"boy grows up to be hero\\" type story (though it's only the first of a trilogy).<br /><br />I liked the book, and maybe it's \\"the best fantasy novel in years,\\" but that also might not be as high a praise as people think.

Yoshitaka Amano mixes concept art of a fantasy world with medievil and Japanese styles.  If you are a true fan you will really enjoy this.
0812550706|3.0|I gave this books three stars for the following reasons:  the first 200 pages were probably worth two stars, while I'd give the last 100 pages four stars.  This book has received many excellent reviews, and I'm a bit confused by that.  At page 120 I felt the book started getting interesting, but after a few pages reverted to its uninteresting story line and dialog.  I persevered because I don't like to quit a book and because one of my sons told me how good it was.  Things picked up at page 200 and I was hooked.  It's just too bad the whole book couldn't have been as interesting.
0783226845|5.0|I always knew Al Pacino was good, but I never thought he was such an outstanding actor, until I saw Scent of a Woman. His performance in this movie was so stellar that I think it ought to be the best acting that I've seen in any movie, by anyone. I know this is a bold statement, but I honestly don't think it's a hyperbolic one at all.    Almost every major scene can become a classic moment--one of those clips that they use to introduce a nominee at the Oscars--in this movie; from the first \\"interview\\" to the Tango, to the dinner, to driving the Ferrari, and of course, to the final speech at the school. In every scene, Al Pacino's acting was rich, deep, and highly nuanced. I just can't believe that acting can be that good.    This movie makes me sad that Al Pacino didn't get to do more movies like this where he can truly express his true talent. I feel like we're all missing out on what he could've done had he been in more dramas like Scent of a Woman.    Al Pacino's performance alone is a good-enough reason for watching this movie, over and over. That's not to say that the movie itself is bad in any way--it's a great movie in its own right. The direction, sound, cinematography are all outstanding, albeit overshadowed by Al Pacino's unbelievable role.

0446608955|3.0|I might never have read this book if not for the movie, by the same name. I was enamored by the movie, enough to want to read the book. As happens almost all the time, there were really big differences between the book and the movie, and I can't say I am happy about that.     Landon Carter is a typical high school student, with scant interest in his academics. His father is a Congressman, whose family has a long history with Reverend Sullivan, Jamie's father. Jamie, on the other hand, is the personification of the ideal girl. Loved by all, including the adults, for her everything is about the Lord's plan. She manages to see God's hand in almost every event, no matter how much sadness may be caused. When Landon and Jamie are paired up in a drama, they inevitably find themselves seeing each other more often than they had ever in all they years the knew each other.     I couldn't appreciate Landon's and Jamie's relationship much. I think the movie brought it out better, but in the book, it just fell flat on me. Landon initially doesn't want anything to do with Jamie, and spends a lot of time letting the reader know what he doesn't like about her. When his turnaround came, I found it hard to buy. His change appeared to me an abrupt makeover. The author tries to show it as being gradual, but when you consider the time span, it really wasn't. As for Jamie, I'm sure there are good girls like her, but a perfect one like her was just a little too far-fetched a concept.     However, I was still able to enjoy the book. The length and the easy writing had a lot to do with that. A Walk to Remember is a breeze to read. I read it in one sitting. Landon proves to be a great narrator, as his wise-crack mind manages to see the humor in even the most absurd or dismal situations. I wouldn't really call this a romantic comedy, which it is not, but there is some well-placed humor that can entertain you. Although I shed quite some tears while watching the movie, I couldn't work myself upwhile reading this book. I guess that's because I already knew what's coming. Nicholas Sparks' books aren't famous for HEA endings.     The previous Nicholas Sparks novel that I had read was The Guardian. I wasn't too impressed by that one either. I somehow feel that I may be done with Nicholas Sparks, unless I get strongly inspired to try any more of his books
1591843162|4.0|Godin is a marketing whiz and great speaker. This book is about, as he would put it, \\"being an artist.\\" That is, going above and beyond in doing whatever it is that you do. Making yourself indispensible to your company. The kind of person your company couldn't live without. In the current economic climate, that's a pretty good goal for anyone.<br /><br />The book is written in short, blog-post-length chapters. Some are really insightful. Then there are some that seem pretty common sense and others, particularly those where Godin tries to define \\"art,\\" that are a little annoying.  But the bulk of the book has good, applicable advice.<br /><br />In one relatable chapter, Godin discusses \\"thrashing\\"--what some might call divergent thinking, and how most of it should be done at the beginning of a project. Anyone who will be involved should be involved at that stage. As the project moves toward \\"shipping,\\" fewer and fewer people should be involved and less and less thrashing should take place. Good advice for any creative environment.<br /><br />Godin discusses the significance of fear as a motivator in our everyday lives, which has interesting psychological implications. But the most interesting point he makes is when he emphasizes the importance of being able to evaluate something without bias--being able to remove yourself from yourself and see things or judge an idea by what it is, not what it is to you. This, he says, is one of the most important qualities one can possess. He lays out a map on which he places the linchpin--the person who is passionate but able to detach from their relativistic biases and make decisions with a clear mind.<br /><br />This, toward the end of the book, is the book's high point. But all in all, it's not a bad read, with quite a few bits of wisdom here and there.
1401323820|5.0|While not high literature, thoroughly enjoyable as appetizer for the entree of the TV show!
0385523386|3.0|This was a pretty good book.  An easy read and interesting account of her time served in a woman's federal prison.  The author does a good job setting up the story and describing the ins and outs of prison life.  The one big negative of the book is, the author several times communicates her opinion that drug dealers and drug offenders don't deserve to do time in prison.   It started to get a little annoying, although she seems somewhat remorseful she seems pretty aloof to the negative impact her crime and other drug related crimes have victims of drug addiction and society as a whole.  If you can ignore some of her personal opinions is a pretty decent read.
1400067936|2.0|I should start by admitting that I could not finish the book (I was gratified to see that it was not just me) -- it is a ramble, and the point is completely obscured. The point, however, is very simple, and can be made in one paragraph, as below:<br /><br />Consider the \\"grand martingale\\" gambling strategy: every day, come to a casino, bet a dollar on red. If you win -- walk away. If you lose -- double your bet, and continue until you win. With this strategy, if you have $1000 in the bank, you will make a 25% a year return, with a sharpe ratio of infinity, for four years (approximately). After which you will lose all of your money. The point is that this is precisely the sort of strategies incentivized by the current wall street compensation structure, and it is easy to look like a genius while  the strategy is running (if you run a hedge fund, this strategy will make YOU a lot of money, but not your investors, or if you are leverage, it will make you and your investors money, but will screw the bank lending you the money. Welcome to 2008).
B0035KESBE|2.0|After watching \\"This Is It\\" 2 dozen times, I had set my hopes high that this was going to be another winner in my collection; I was wrong. Although I love Michael Jackson's work, this movie is just a disjointed collection of ideas that makes it impossible to follow, or enjoy fully. There are good moments in his performances, and interesting old footage, but I'm not planning to watch it a second time. In my humble opinion, save your money.
076790592X|5.0|My dad recommended this book to me when I was ranting about my dislike for other \\"popular\\" inspirational books.  I wanted more from them and I wasn't finding it.<br /><br />Tuesdays with Morrie is a little, unassuming, plain book that I would have never picked up on my own.  I knew very little about it and my dad didn't disclose much when he told me to read it.  Then, as I was browsing through a library sale, I saw it - sitting beneath the 25 cent sign.<br /><br />I found in this book what I was looking for.  Did I find the answer to the ultimate question? No.  I'll leave that to Douglas Adams and his 42.  I found love, honesty, death and life in this little book.  Morrie talks about how there are three stages of life, the youth who doesn't think of death, the middle-aged person who realizes death is something that is approaching, and the older person who has to accept death.  As I move from the first stage to the next I've struggled with how to accept death.  I have my religious beliefs, sure.  But, like Morrie, I struggle with how much I will miss those I love most - my family and select few close friends.  It's such a bittersweet feeling, knowing that you must nurture those close relationships, listen to your family, comfort them and laugh with them and then one day, say goodbye to them.<br /><br />Morrie inspires me to listen more and love more.  At one point he says:<br /><br />\\"Why do you think it's so important for me to hear other people's problems?  Don't I have enough pain and suffering of my own?<br /><br />\\"Of course I do.  But giving to other people is what makes me feel alive.  Not my car or my house.  Not what I look like in the mirror.  When I give my time, when I can make someone smile after they were feeling sad, it's as close to healthy as I ever feel.<br /><br />\\"Do the kinds of things that come from the heart.  When you do, you won't be dissatisfied, you won't be envious, you won't be longing for somebody else's things.  On the contrary, you'll be overwhelmed with what comes back.\\"<br /><br />If that's not a challenge, I don't know what it is.  This book inspires me to look to other people, to listen - really listen to them.  To show comfort and understanding and true joy in whatever it is they need to say to me.<br /><br />And that's why this inspirational book is exactly what I was looking for.at's not a challenge, I don't know what it is.

1892005034|1.0|According to the author, none of these reviews mean anything since they are our \\"personal evaluations\\".  Nevertheless, here it goes.  I really hate it when someone lifts the work of numerous authors before them and tries to present it as their original work, usually by trying to coin a name for it such as the author did here.  I read about 60 pages of this book then skimmed through the rest of it and realized I was wasting my time and had read it all before.  Unless you have never read the first book on anger-management, group communications, interpersonal relationships or even a basic primer on Cognitive Therapy, you will not learn anything from this book.  It has it points that have been well taken from all the original works that have gone before this and if you can get past the self-aggrandizing stories, you can get to the basic information.  However, Rosenberg has done a great disservice not crediting the works of original authors on this subject that has been covered in better books over the last 30 years.
B00009UTQD|5.0|In short,    It is amazing and do the job... high-quality in everything... most important it takes up to five filters and it is harmless to them...    I use it with my Tamrac Expedition 7X and Tamrac Belt...    Although it designed to carry 5 filters, still there is room for 3 more filters, and there are two ways to accomplish that :)    The 1st way, by joining two filters together and insert them in one pocket.  This is a good way but it wont works if you change filters frequently, because you have to dis-attach the joined filters which takes some time... yet, it is good for storing filters in case you don't use them a lot.    The 2nd way, which I use more often than the 1st way, is by using the cotton pad that comes inside the filter container/box.  I install this pad between the filters, that gives me space for 8-10 filters -- based on the thickness of the filter.    I strongly recommend this item, it can be used with the Tamrac Accessory Belt or any other belt...
B000EGF0QY|5.0|This is my first encounter with David Sedaris. He has a marvelous dry sense of humor and is an enjoyable read. Although we are using this as a text and it is required reading, there is little or no effort to read his essays. EXCELLENT book.
0891419063|5.0|To prepare myself for the HBO Series The Pacific I obtained a copy of this novel and was shocked at how horrible this war front really was.  A vivid account of E.B. Sledge's Pacific wars and brutal imagery to paint those gripping strugles you almost feel like you are there next to Sledgehammer.  Based off of notes kept in secret written in his bible gives you personal views of what went through this soldiers mind in the toughest of battles.  Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow subs nicknames for the soldiers in his novel Sledge uses actual names so if and when you compare the journals of Sledge to the HBO The Pacific you want be disappointed.  Sledge's use of imagery in his telling almost makes you feel the mud on your skin, the smell that hangs in the air, and feel the hoplessness of each battle.  A great historical document that many should cherish least we forget!
B002ZFQD04|5.0|I was very excited when the dvd/blue ray was released. I attended 3 of the shows in Buenos Aires! The shows were just great, I was a few meters away from the Queen in the VIP area. She even gave me the finger when I shouted mother f--er after she rocked Borderline, that was just amazing! The highest peaks were Vogue, Like a Prayer, Into the Groove, Borderline, Into the Groove, Music, Don't Cry for my Argentina and Give it to me.     I have only 2 \\"bad\\" things to say regarding the DVD: 1) The audience was much more thunderous than it actually sounds like in the final edit. 2) Her voice was so digitally modified in many tracks that the whole feeling of those songs was lost. For example: Her live-voice in Borderline was much rocker, hard, rough. I really loved it; but the voice in the video is more or less the same she had when she first recorded the track in 1984. I know the reason, Madge is a prefectionist, and she wants people who buy the DVD to get perfect vocals. But we love her, we don't need edition, we already know MADONNA IS PERFECTION.    Regarding the good aspects, well, I believe you can tell in the face of Madonna how happy she was, you can tell the conection she felt with the audience. Madonna in Argentina is THE popstar, there's no other: no Cher, no Mariah, no Britney, no Christina, no Lady GaGa. She's not pink-ly loved like a sweet popstar, but she receives the treatment and ovation of a ROCK STAR!    Everything in the concert is magical, beautiful and perfectly done. Madonna does not leave any detail to random, everything is \\"mathematically\\" calculated. And that my friends shows how much she respects her fans!

B002HFP0QU|5.0|Sometimes you buy a CD and, after listening to it, wish you hadn't bought it for whatever reason. Not the case here.  Excellent music, good quality sound on two generously-filled CDs.  I would recommend this to anyone who does not already own these songs on other albums. Very career encompassing. As one who was more into folk, rock and blues, I tend to favor the pre-disco era songs.  I don't dislike the dance tunes, and some of them are quite good, I just prefer the older stuff.  No one that I can recall had harmonies as tight as these three brothers.  As a child, I listened to the Everly's and the early Beatles (how could I not) during the sixties and early seventies. The Bee Gees were the succesors to those two acts, so to speak.<br />  After the mid-sixties, the Beatles had pretty much abandoned the harmony and were each doing there own thing.  For those who claim that the earlier Bee Gees were Beatles knock-offs, I have one or two observations to make.  To start,  when the Beatles themselves hit the bigtime, first in Britain and then America, there were dozens of groups playing the same style (beat groups).  Nobody was really copying anyone, that was the sound at the time!  So when the Bee Gees hit the international scene in 1967 their sound was very similar to certain elements of the Beatles and others who embraced pop and psychedelia.  However, anyone familiar with that era can tell you that the Beatles and the Bee Gees had their differences.  The main difference is that, while the Beatles were becoming four creative and talented individuals creating records in the studio, the Bee Gees continued, for the most part, to remain a cohesive recording and performing act, lending their abilities to write songs with beautifully executed harmonies to the contemporary scene in the late sixties and early seventies.  As such, they coud be seen as an extension of what the earlier Beatles had accomplished, or possibly what the Beatles would have sounded like in the same period if they had not fragmented (I know this sounds like a bit of a stretch coming from a HUGE Beatle fan and maybe some of you are already scratching your heads).  But let's face it,  the Beatles had dropped the Moon and June lyrics by '67.  The Bee Gees sang what were wonderfully contemporary love songs dipped in that pop, soul, psychedlic mix that their beautiful voices and close harmonies accentuated.  Great stuff.  And considering they were barely out of their teens, some surprisingly introspective lyrics as well.<br />  Let me introduce you to my wife. She loves to dance.  She loves the disco stuff.  Soooo, for I who have nothing (money, that is) this disc is a great buy.  It has just about every great dance tune that she could want.  She also likes some of the older stuff as well, her favorite being \\"How can you mend a lonely heart\\".  So, this disc has the power to please fans of the older and newer Bee Gees music.<br />  If you are heavily into the Bee Gees, then you probably already have their other albums and don't need this, but for everyone else it seems to be a good bet.od if they had not fragmented (I know this sounds like a bit of a stretch coming from a HUGE Beatle fan and maybe some of you are already scratching your heads).

044656740X|1.0|this guy is a con artist, snake oil salesman. the fact that this book is still on sell on amazon just shows how low the averaging Joe's financial IQ can be.  this book and all others written by him are total trash, he gets rich by selling this trash to the average joe who wants to learn a \\"secret\\" of getting rich. what a shame!
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Outstanding release.  There isn't a bad song on here.  This cd picks up where the first two left off.  If you loved the first two then purchase this one.  It will not disapoint.  Can't wait to see them again in concert this summer.
0316017922|4.0|I enjoy Gladwell's books - easy to read, entertaining and generally insightful.  Outliers fits the bill, although he starts off with a basic assumption - \\"We pretend that success is exclusively a matter of individual merit.\\" - that I'm not sure is all that valid.  I think most people would agree that circumstance and luck also play a part in creating success, and that's essentially the point he's making in this book.  As such, I wasn't blown away by any new insights here - more a validation of what I always believed.  Nevertheless, I would still recommend the book.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I bought the first and second season of these as a gift for my fiance and he loves them. He cant stop watching them. Definitely addictive and interesting. A great gift for any adult.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Only my second day using 30 Day Shred. I am SO SORE! As painful as it is, it lets me know that I am actually working something out! I am using this product to hopefully lose some weight. I do have the Biggest Loser Boot Camp with I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, but I wanted to try something else. I will give an updated review when I am finished with the DVD.     It goes by SO FAST, level 1 anyways! LOL :P
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Buy the DVDs they are worth the time and money! You will be hooked from the start, great story line and actors, not like some of the short lived shows out there. This one will stay around for awhile so its worth the purchase now.

0061706620|4.0|I'm over half way through John's Journal.  So far, it's a great fluff book you could use for the RPG or stand alone novel.  It does go into what John feels as he goes through a few years without his wife and taking care of Sam and Dean.      My only complaint is that there are a few pages (like 5 to 10) that have foreign languages, pictographs, and cuneiform without any translations.  I just felt a little jiped because I was unable to read some of the journal and don't really have the time to try and translate it...
0515123447|3.0|The books starts off well, the first chapter got me interested. For the most part, the chapters started and ended in such a way as to keep me reading and intersted in what would happen next. There is a lot of action at times, that keeps the story going. Overall I enjoyed the read. However, the book does have lots of flaws. There are key plot elements that simply are not credible. That was a distraction for me at times. The characters are cardboard stereotypes, stock almost, and thus, not interesting. The description of the south (Georgia) is more like what someone who has never been there thinks it should be like, rather than a realistic portrayal how it really is. There are some really big plot holes, information details that are inaccurate, and most of the plot twists were easy to spot and anticipate, so much so that I began to doubt the characters intelligence. So often they miss things they should not miss, assume things they should not assume, and then correctly deduct things that could never be deduced in the real world based on the info available. For the most part I overlooked all those flaws as I read the book and was mostly able to enjoy it.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Falling in love with the one person you never thought you might like is a refreshing story, especially when played by Bullock and Reynolds. Silly and entertaining with the bonus of Betty White being as silly and cute as ever.
B002ZHKZEC|4.0|These stories provided a generally good send-off to David Tennant's Doctor.  The first two stories were a little weaker, but still entertaining.  \\"Waters of Mars\\" was one of the scariest and best \\"Doctor Who\\" stories written by Russel T. Davies, in the same league as \\"Midnight\\".  The first part of \\"The End of Time\\" was a bit slow, while part 2 was quite engaging.<br /><br />One really enjoyable thing about the Blu Ray format is being able to see \\"Doctor Who\\" in HD for the first time.  Quite a change from the cheap cheesiness of the '70's Tom Baker episodes that first got me to love the show.  My one complaint about the Blu Ray set is that it is a bit light on extra features compared with the DVD sets for Series 1-4.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Isabelle Fuhrman is such a great actress that you will enjoy watching her being a creepy and evil teen aged girl. I'm not a big fan of this kind of movies but with great actors like Fuhrman, I can easily be converted!
B000002OX7|1.0|Yo people whats good??  I was daning' to T.I. at the mall food court and this funny old janitor said I shood listen to deeper musik with meaning and he hooked me up with this disk by some band who couldn't think of a name and called themselves The Who??  I played this and got tons of laughs, it was so bad and unmemorable, the beats were out-dated, the rhymes were wack, the samples were from lame Irish jigs of the 40's and the drumber is just hitting wind chimes on discarded Dodge Omni car roofs.  I don't believe that song \\"My Wife\\" cuz no one wood marry one of these guys, and \\"The Song Is Over\\" is a lie cuz I played it and it didn't end, it just went on and on.  What about \\"Bargain\\", even if this disk was free it would still be a rip off!! The cover of Bizkit's Behind Blue Eyes was weak, Peter Denis can't hokld a candle to Fred Dursts vocal.  I liked the meaning behind \\"Won't get fooled Again\\" cuz I will never be fooled to play this unremarkable music by cheesy geezers from the sixties!!  For good musik stick with Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Justin Beiber, Lady Gaga, Kid Rock, Pitbull, T.I., Flo Rida, Staind, All American Rejects, Fall Out Boy, Death cab For Cutie, Disturbed, Weezer, Drowning Pool, Nickleback, Creed, Miley Cyrus, Jay Z and the rock n roll of The Used.  Go Bengals!! Who Dey??<br /><br />Was this review helpful??  Of course it was!!
B000EGDC0A|4.0|Whenever I hear any piece by Goldfrapp I know the source immediately.  The duo produces music that is so different and enjoyable.  I'm pretty busy (even though I sit while I work) so I listen to music through headphones most of the time.  This music doesn't suddenly leap down the line and crush my eardrums, nor does it spend time in inaudible softness. (Something that classic music loves to do.)
B003CR9BYE|1.0|I love the music on this CD, and have in the many editions I've purchased over the years.  My beef is with 1.) The sonics on this new (and poor sounding) remix, and 2.) the five (yes five) chosen-for-artisitic-reasons edits that were in the original mixes that were ignored when the remix was put together, meaning now we get to hear \\"warts\\" that could easily have been worked around, just as they were on the previous mix.  (The painfully obvious one:  the wrong bass note at 2:24 in Corcovado.)    If you listen on a boom box or iPod, the new CD will prove to be a perfectly fine source.  If you listen critically, stick with the previous CD issues.  The convenience of a single disc here is a nice feature, but the sound?  Not so much.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is, quite simply, the greatest example of a comic-book inspired film, and one of the finest pieces of cinema ever. I've watched this movie in the theater, I've watched it on DVD, and I've watched it on blu-ray. Having said that, I can safely say that the blu-ray version best represents this movie, though the IMAX sequences are the only real selling points for the blu-ray format. See, the letterbox sequences are good, don't get me wrong, but there's noticeable grain all over the place. The IMAX sequences, on the other hand, are crystal clear and, obviously, in the 1.78:1 (16:9) ratio typical for HDTVs. You'll also be getting some special features, such as the Focus Points on the main disc. The Focus Points are actually very interesting, and thoroughly explain how several scenes were created. All of these are formatted in a 16:9 ratio. The second disc has some interesting documentaries, in 16:9 high-def no less, and art galleries. As I recall, I saw these documentaries on the History Channel shortly before or after TDK was released in North American theaters. If you saw them then, you'll still want to check them out.
0061245097|3.0|I enjoyed the first novel involving Cat as the main character, it was a 4 star book. This book, however, I can't. I was bored out of my mind with Cat. This is my gripe, may be yours too, we'll see:<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />* Superwoman takes on disposable lame villains. See, this is the reason why I ended up reading Spade/Denise book first because I tend to avoid books and movies with vampire hunters in them, especially those involving half-breeds of some sort. It's never consistent and every enemy in the story is made out to be some dimwitted, slow-moving, screw-up in order for the hero/heroine to come out on top. By the third page of this book I had rolled by eyes at least twice.<br /><br />*Not only was Cat super strong, but she just HAD to talk SOOOO much crap in between each blow. How clich&eacute;d. This book was overflowing with bravado, each page was drenched in it.<br /><br />*Can someone please tell me why not ONE vampire in the books was able to dodge one of her many, many, daggers? It was almost as if every vampire in the book just stood still and waited to get stabbed in the heart with her daggers. No one deflected a dagger, or caught one in mid air. You'd think with vampires being super fast, they'd see a big silver knife headed their way, but I guess not.<br /><br />*Can someone explain to me why it seemed that cat was stronger than EVERY vampire in the book other than Bones and Mencheres? She even defeated Ian, who is Bones's sire. She took on a cave full of vampires on her own and managed to not end up dead, even outrunning a possible master vampire who may have been 500 years old. If Bones can fly and he's not even 300 years old, then why couldn't the other vampires as old as Bones or older?<br /><br />*It got to the point, I skipped Cat's fight scenes, because they were far too unbelievable for me choke down with a straight face.<br /><br />* Another reviewer mentioned the new characters, saying they didn't have enough personality for you to really develope a liking to them and it's true. Not only did the men on her team seem like a bunch of brown-nosers, they just didn't grab you. Tate with his constant whining seemed to border on self-masochism, and didn't make me feel one way or the other about him. The other two men where just \\"there\\".  Then we have Denise who's supposed to be Cat's best friend, but you don't hear about her any more after the wedding which did seem like a plot device to get Bones and Cat together again. But Denise wasn't even an after thought when Cat was thinking about protecting the people she loved from her enemies. They watched her mom's house and her ex-boyfriend (forgot his name), but no thought about Denise.<br /><br />The plotline with Ian, seemed unnecessary. It could have been handled easily just by them telling the truth. Ian only went after her because he thought she was free and unprotected, so he could claim her. Had Bones told him when he first spoke to Ian, \\"no, that's my woman and I'm going to get her back. I need you to back off.\\" I'm sure Ian would have stayed away. Instead, it was like they wanted to grind an ax for no apparent reason. As if kicking Ian's butt wasn't good enough, she had to rub his nose in her crap too. That brings up the point another review made about \\"too much wish-fulfillment\\" and I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />What I did like:<br /><br />Bones is an attention grabber and he keeps me glued to every page with his name on it. I didn't mind him being strong, just seemed he was the only strong vampire in the world, even stronger than Ian and I don't see how that's possible if Ian is his sire. Didn't seem right.<br /><br />I did like some of the scenarios in the books, the cat fight was fun, but it would have been better if Annette didn't get the floor wiped with herself and managed to save some face, having been a 2 hundred year old vampire. But no one could defeat the Cat, I guess.<br /><br />I'm still intrigued enough with the other characters to continue reading this series, but I have officially wiped my hands clean of Cat, she's become a too overblown character in my opinion. There's no suspense in that.e's become a too overblown character in my opinion. There's no suspense in that.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|First off, it should be said that this movie does not have ANY special features. I don't so much mind that, because I only watch them once or twice anyway. However, if you are a big fan of getting a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into a movie, then you WILL be disappointed. In that case, save your money and wait for the big release in November.     If you are like me, however, and just want to see the movie for all that it is, you will not be disappointed at all. This blu-ray movie is absolutely the most gorgeous piece of cinema to ever grace a television screen. The whole film is shot in a 1.78:1 ratio (more commonly referred to as 16:9), so there is no letterbox when it's viewed on an HDTV, a welcome change that puts even The Dark Knight's excellent blu-ray disc to shame. The sound is amazing, as well. A word of advice for those coming into blu-ray: get a Surround Sound set-up. With the technology behind blu-ray discs and HDMI cables, surround sound has reached an entirely new level.    I won't get into the story of the movie, because, quite frankly, it's not important. I'm sure James Cameron realized that when he was creating this movie. You will spend more time gawking at the screen, wondering what is and what isn't CGI. It's all blended so seamlessly in an absolutely stunning way. For a cinematic experience, you can do no better than Avatar on blu-ray.    The same cannot be said, however, for the DVD. Without all the bells and whistles, Avatar really cannot stand as the epic it is made out to be. It is a decent story, but the real impact of the film lies in its visuals and sound. You have been warned.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I must admit that I kept ignoring this film,even though Netflix insisted I would enjoy it. Finally, on a rainy Sunday night I caved in and watched it. Boy, was I happy I did.     This production is right up there with the best of BBC's mini-series, including, as many have already mentioned, Pride & Prejudice (1995). I loved it so much I went out and bought it the next day.    Mr. Thornton, played by the BEAUTIFUL and DELICIOUS Richard Armitage is to die for.   The \\"Look back. Look back at me\\" alone was swoon worthy.   Armitage/Thornton is the epitome of a broody, romantic GOD! Unlike Darcy, Thornton has a back story. And the viewer learns the reasons behind his being so serious and stern.     The series is beautifully shot.   The story tugs at the heart strings.   The sound track is amazing!  And there is not one moment where the viewer becomes bored or wishes to fast forward.   The entire supporting cast-- especially Brendan Coyle who play Nicholas Higgins and Sinead Cusack who plays Hannah Thornton-- is absolutely outstanding.     The great thing about the DVD is includes subtitles (even the special features), which I have to admit, I needed, especially with all the different dialects!     The only thing that bothered me was that it ended. Four hours was not long enough! I didn't want it to end. But alas, it had to. I'm just so happy I have it on DVD so I can watch it over and over again!
B001HN69AY|4.0|I find I must begin this review by saying I am NOT a Gilliam fan, nor am I quite fond of Jude Law or Collin Farrell.  I will confess that the primary draw of this movie is similar to that of [[ASIN:B000059XUO The Crow (Miramax/Dimension Collector's Series)]]: The leading male, of which the film places great deal of attention on, dies during filming before ever concluding his role.      The late Heath Ledger is, and has always been, a phenomenal actor and a true force to be reckoned with, even posthumously as we discovered with his win for The Joker.  You can expect nothing less than a superb, realistic performance from the late actor as Tony.  The character is highly believable, charming, and layered.  You do not begin to see the \\"true\\" nature of Tony until you step inside the mirror of Doctor Parnassus into the Imaginarium.      While some have mentioned that the wager with Mr. Nick is never clearly explained, I will make note that one must look beyond the surface of the characters and spoken word.  There are flashback sequences and subtle, intentional, script clues that give away a great deal of the story that may not be outwardly expressed.  It is not a film you can sit back and idly watch; it does require an active viewing for the story to truly click.    As for the performances of the three actors stepping in to fill the shoes of Tony, each portrayed their respectable layer of the character quite superbly.  Johnny Depp is the most like Heath Ledger's portrayal of Tony, so much so, in fact, that it takes one a moment or two to truly grasp that the character has changed.  Jude Law, while not as concise when it comes to the particular vocal characteristics prescribed to the character, does a marvelous job.  As does Colin Farrell, even though both actors are nowhere near as good at what I like to call `chameleon acting.'  Both do portray the character well and tell the story beautifully.    If you are not a fan of the strange and often macabre styled films and stories, you will take little pleasure in the content of the movie itself, but the stunning visuals and quirky style of the film should keep your interest throughout the film.

B001EN71CW|5.0|this very well presented show looks wonderful in blu ray. I recommend this compilation to all lovers of the tv show firefly. the 3 never released shows help weave together a story that ended way to soon.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|they must really think americans are stupid. i can't think of any other reason why they would change the narrator or script for the american version. do yourself a favor and buy the bbc version with david attenborough. if you enjoy being spoken to like you are a child then get the oprah version.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This New Zealand born guitarist, singer, song writer started his carreer in Brisbane Australia to then move to Nashville with a single bag of clothes and only his guitar on his back. Defying Gravity is considered by many critics as Urban's best produced album that he has put out to date.<br /><br />This reviewer agrees whole heartedly.<br /><br />We all have at least a little romance in us and Defying Gravity spills forth pure heart in every song.<br /><br />Keith Urban's rise in Nashville is every country musician's dream. It is known when he was trying to find work, other musicians would let Keith sleep on their couches', until he landed a job as a studio musician as he can play: guitar, banjo, bass guitar, mandoline, piano, bouzouki and drums. The man's voice too, is melodic and perfect for any love song.<br /><br />Defying gravity, released in 2009, is full of love songs - and all of them are a work of pure art.<br /><br />My roomate, who doesn't necessarily like country music, commented, this CD is a \\"pleasure\\" to sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />I agree without reservation.
1573226521|2.0|I have to give it at least two stars because the story was well crafted, even though the characters were not really developed, as others noted, with the exception of Jed and Keaty. However, the style of writing is convincing - a young traveller's diary, so you can hardly expect great depth. The adventure really starts out as promising, and the \\"be careful what you wish for\\" story starts to develop toward the latter part of the book, but excessive gore at the end really destroys it. The author really botched it badly - it would have been more convincing had it been less grossly violent and gory. It had destroyed whatever was built up to that point, the climax overpowered the buildup to such an etxent that it had me toss the book away in exasperation.  The movie was quite a bit better, in my opinion, because there is no way it could reproduce the sort of depravity described in the book, yet it captured the main storyline with a few deviations, rather well. The acting was excellent, and nothing was exaggerated, as I feel was in the book.
B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|I love A-ha!  Underrated as one-hit-wonders in the US (everyone conveniently forgets \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\" was a hit, too.), I think they made really compelling music in the 80's, overshadowed by the fun but empty hit \\"Take On Me\\" and their silly band name.  Still, they only made three good albums:  Hunting High and Low, Scoundrel Days, and now Foot of the Mountain, their swan song.  Aside from some highlights along the way (title tracks from \\"Stay on These Roads\\" and \\"Minor Earth/Major Sky\\"), they delved into the dull Easy Listening side of Adult Contemporary over the years.  Foot of the Mountain is still Adult Contemporary, but definitely not Easy Listening.  It's thrilling, beat-laden, synth pop.  \\"Sunny Mystery\\" is hands down their best track since Scoundrel Days.    Supposedly, the band is breaking up after the tour to support Foot of the Mountain.  That's too bad.  They've finally returned to making compelling music!

006112429X|5.0|A brave and thought-provoking book dealing with the eternal nature vs nurture debate and our need to apportion blame for terrible events. Controversially tackling the taboo of mothers who don't bond with their children, this is a `must read' book.    At the heart of Lionel Shriver's 2005 Orange Prize winning novel is the issue of nature vs nurture - what makes a person like he or she is? Is the eponymous Kevin born evil or is he influenced by his mother's coldness towards him. There are no clear answers and that's what gives this brave book, which tackles the taboos that some mothers don't bond with their children, such power.     The story of Kevin, from before he is born to that tragic Thursday when he murders several classmates and a teacher in a `Columbine'-style killing is told in a series of letters from his mother, Eva, written to her apparently estranged husband, Franklin. Eva struggles to answer the one great unanswered question about the spate of school killings that happened in the US in the late 1990s - why?. Surely it must be someone's fault. Who is to blame?    What gives this book so much of its strength is that it is told only from the point of view of Eva in her letters to Franklin. Looking back on events, it seems that everyone is against her and her apparent honesty and willingness to accept fault makes her appear both very human and deserving of the reader's sympathy and trust. A successful career woman, her decision to have a child with Franklin, with whom her relationship appears a bit shaky, is as much to do with their sustaining their relationship as with a maternal urge. In fact, she doesn't really have that maternal drive and yet that is what society appears to expect of her. When Kevin turns out to be less than angelic, the gaps in her relationship with Franklin widen. You can see it happening and Eva recalls it all in painful but ordered detail. So when discrepancies start to appear in her own account, the reader is completely torn. How reliable is she as a witness to her own life?    The book takes a little while to get into. It's as if in the early pages, Eva is struggling to find her voice and the clarity to trace through Kevin's life. But Shriver is a wonderful storyteller and manages to drip feed the reader with just enough information to weave the pattern of the story. You are drawn in by her openness and honesty. Ultimately I concluded that all I could say is that at least she believes what she is saying is the truth. But that's what I loved about the book - it makes the reader think and makes you part of the story.    And Shriver has plenty of twists up her sleeve to tug at the reader's emotions.    It's complex, multi-layered and tackles real issues and societal taboos with exceptional clarity and bravery and these issues are not going away any time soon. Highly recommended ..... although perhaps not if you are expecting your first child!
B00003CY6M|5.0|This is a great feel good movie; a sweet and entertaining fairytale with fantastic leads.     The destiny/fate theme is thin and cliche, but the work put into this film by everyone involved (The writers, Peter Chelsom, the actors, all other movie crew, etc.) elevates its quality.    The script was witty and nicely done; even the jokes/humor in this movie had an intellectual air about it. It was also great to find out that John Cusack (who I adore) also added a lot into the script - I wonder if he included that part about Cassiopeia from \\"The Sure Thing\\", the book \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" which also appeared in High Fidelity?     There were formulaic RomCom scenes as well, but there's no need to overanalyze it. I really admire the fact that they brought a different spin to the boy meets girl and the chase story.     On a personal note; I could relate to both main characters (Sara and Jonathan) because I did fall in love with someone almost the same way before (but he was involved with someone else) - and I can't forget him or erase him out of my memory...but of course in the real world I doubt that we'll ever get together.    Now on to the characters:    Kate Beckinsale as Sara Thomas and John Cusack as Jonathan Trager were terrific! I LOVED their chemistry, but wish that they had more screentime together, although I understand that careful balance had to be placed by Peter Chelsom because a majority of this film was focused on the \\"chase\\" to keep things exciting. There were some things that I noted about Cusack (probably because I'm a fan of his movies); his outfits and the fact that he was wearing fingerless gloves and a faded grey henley undershirt most of the time in the movie---that reminded me of \\"Say Anything\\". Hopefully both actors will be able to do a movie together again in the future.    Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon were fantastic as their respective best buds, and both bring the right balance of humor into the mix. I like it when Piven is in a movie with Cusack. Eugene Levy was funny as always; he was a scene stealer for sure. I also enjoyed the performances of John Corbitt and Bridgett Moynahan as well.    John Corbitt had that hilarious Yanni/Sting music going on, with a crazy music video to match. In regards to Moynahan's character; I know that some of the audience were wondering what was wrong with her, why did Jonathan Trager dump a perfect girl for Sara who he really doesn't know. There was that dinner scene right after the fastforward time lapse where Halley (Moynahan's character)whispers to Jonathan about Dean (Piven) and his wife. They both mention something about how happy the couple were and that they have no fights, then Jonathan mentions that it must be a b*tch on their sex life...fast forward to the scene outside the Waldorf Astoria, Halle tells Jonathan that she'll get undressed hop into bed and act like they just got over a fight - I think this was an indication that Halley and Jonathan were constatly having fights and things were not as perfect as it seems between the two of them. Anyways I guess that in the end (and even in real life) being with or knowing someone for a long time isn't going to save you from having a relationship go bad. I have friends who were living together with their partner for many years, only to break up not long after they get engaged...then they end up marrying someone else within a year or so - but end up with a happy marriage.     I'm a bit shocked by some of the negative reviews...to each his/her own I guess. I feel that this movie is so underrated and although it's not a perfect film, it's definitely not as terrible as some people make it out to be.
B000PHX5RS|5.0|Three individual discs are a sign of \\"class\\". I have seen collections where there would be one film on a side of a DVD and one or two films on the other side. Not with this collection of three classic films, two which were Academy Award nominees & winners for numerous categories. Lets start with the 1968 production motion picture of Shakespeare's \\"Romeo & Juliet\\". The film stars Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey who were excellent in this film and also seems to have been the pinnacle of their film careers. Leonard Whiting sang lead vocals in the mid 1970's for \\"The Alan Parsons Project\\" tune-\\"The Raven\\" & then did small bits for television in the U.S. Olivia Hussey has appeared in 41 films and has won an\\"Annie Award\\" for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement\\" for her vocals on \\"Batman Beyond. The film was directed by Franco Zeffirelli. This film won the Academy Award for \\"Best Cinematography\\" & \\"Best Costume Design\\". It is rumored that Sir Lawrence Olivier spoke the films prologue & epilogue. I remember that at the time this film was the talk of teenage love and everyone saw it more than once while crying in the movie theaters. The film deviates from Shakespeare's play by switching acts, scenes & by creating dialogue such as the \\"Love Theme which was a number one instrumental hit by Henry Mancini. There were two title for the lyrical versions- \\"What Is A Youth\\" & \\"A Time For Us\\" which has been performed by \\"Luciano Pavarotti\\" and if you are a baby boomer you will remember the melody well. The film was originally not rated but eventually was rated \\"M\\" which is the equivalent to \\"PG\\" because of Olivia Hussey's nude scene. In the play Juliet is only 14 years old and Olivia Hussey acts the part extremely well. This is a motion picture Holly wood style & not a Shakespeare exact performance, but it is close, and was ahead of its time 42 years ago.<br />  \\"Love Story\\" was all the rage in 1970 nominated for 7 \\"Academy Awards\\"-Best Picture, Director-Howard G. Minsky, Screenplay, Actor-Ryan Oneal, Actress-Ali MacGraw, Best supporting actor-Marley;  while winning best music. The musical selections were incredible using Bach, Handel & Watts. Awesome film!<br />  \\"Falling in Love\\" stars a youthful Robert DeNiro, Meryl Streep & Harvey Keitel. This love tale was directed in 1984 by Ulu Grosbard. There are no cops or baseball bats in the film, only two people who are \\"Falling In Love.\\" I recomend this collection strongly if for only a night with \\"Your Love.\\"-Review by Craig Barr.y, Actor-Ryan Oneal, Actress-Ali MacGraw, Best supporting actor-Marley;  while winning best music.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Let me start an argument by saying this...that of the three full-time Companions in the first four-part chapter of the 21st century adventures of Doctor Who, that Catherine Tate's Donna Noble was the best Companion for the Doctor.  I can hear the Billie Piper fans screaming about my heresy and the Freema Agyeman supporters wondering if I've lost my marbles (And I LOVED Freema, so I wonder about this myself), but of the three, Donna grew the most as a character/person between her introduction in \\"The Runaway Bride\\" and \\"Journey's End\\".         When we first met Donna, she was an abrasive, shrewish loudmouth, incredibly unaware of the world around her and clearly unaware of the world of The Doctor.  The only thing she could do was talk--LOUDLY--and pretty much defined herself by whether or not she got married.  But the potential for Donna was illuminated at the end of the Season 3 Christmas Special when, in turning down The Doctor's offer to join him, did observe that he needed someone to rein him in.  I always felt that the reason Donna was as she was--and this was something that Tate captured brilliantly--was that, at her core, Donna's yelling masked a very insecure nature in her; a lack of confidence.  After all, Donna Noble seemed headed for the life of being a permanent temp--if not a victim of an alien race.  In her return in Season 4--the magnificent \\"Partners In Crime\\"--she's a much more aware person, investigating the strange and unusual, and pining for travelling with our favorite TimeLord.  Certainly, the sequence where she finally sees The Doctor--when she's looking through the door window, and Ten is outside the building looking in--is just a magnificent mime between Tate and David Tennant, and Donna's commitment to join The Doctor in the TARDIS is delightful.       Thus begins Season 4, with an episode that gives a clue to the season's climax--as has been the habit in this run of the series.  Tennant is, as he has been since inheriting the TARDIS, brilliant in capturing both the humor and the sadness of the Doctor.  The guest turns--Freema Agyeman's three-episode return as a more confident and sharp Martha Jones; Georgia Moffett's adorable Jenny in \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" (Hello, recurring character!!!), Alex Kingston's River Song--the woman who holds clues to The Doctor's future/past (Hello, second recurring character!!!) in \\"Silence In The Library\\" and \\"Forest Of The Dead\\"--has more than a few Doctor elements to her.  But we cannot dismiss Bernard Cribbins' wonderful Wilfred Mott, Donna's grandfather who sees her as being more than a temp, sees her accomplish things beyond the imagination...but sadly, must keep the accomplishments hidden at the end of the year...       But Season 4--at least to me--is about the growth of Donna.  She finds herself being able to help The Doctor in ways that she couldn't imagine, doing things that she couldn't believe (Clocking a Sontaran?  Pretty good...)...yet, she also finds herself mystified as to why, when she wonders about the Doctor's future, there's no mention of her.  Which brings us to the three-part smackdown that finishes the season--\\"Turn Left\\", \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\"; where the whole of The Family of Time--Rose and Jackie, Mickey Smith, Captain Jack Harkness, Martha, and even Penelope Wilton's Harriet Jones--all come back for one last smackdown with the Daleks.  The turn of Donna into what the Ood had seen in \\"Planet Of The Ood\\"--the Doctor/Donna--is a hilarious-heroic sequence that fulfills the growth of Donna Noble in her run...but the last five minutes of the season just...breaks...your...heart.  To realize that Donna has come that far...and to have it all taken away and her going back to who/what she was when she first was introduced...HURTS.       We will look back at Russell T. Davies four season run as the runner for this first chapter of Doctor Who and realize how he had modernized the character; made him relevant again--not just on hisown, but also through \\"The Sarah Jane Adventures\\" and \\"Torchwood\\".  But we will also think of Tennant approaching and at times surpassing the great Tom Baker's interpretation of the TimeLord.  But Season 4 should be remembered for how RTD grew Donna to a great level--and then broke The Doctor's heart (Hearts) and ours in a brilliant and sad manner.       Highly recommended.
0307454541|4.0|I bought this book to go an a trip with several long lay overs. I wanted something that kept my interest.  The beginning was slower paced, but it didn't take long to  get hooked into the story.  I enjoyed it so much I bought the next book in the series.  It was a very indepth story.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be at the premire of this film at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 24 and can only say it blew me away! I've been a Rush fan since Permenant Waves came out in 1980 and thought I knew all there was to know about the band. I was wrong! Rush fans are extremely committed and loyal to the band and will find new information along with old familiar stories throughout the film so, if you're a Rush fan, buy this! If you know a Rush fan, buy it for them!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|This is an interesting propaganda film from Cameron.  Interesting, in how it steals the plot from several other movies (dances with wolves, pocahontas) which were somewhat decent and manages to mangle them up with the smurfs in a repulsive, vomit-inducing train wreck manner to push his retarded philosophy.<br /><br />You might like this film if:<br />You like bland movies.<br />You still watch the smurfs on saturday morning.<br />You are lazy and believe the government should take care of you.<br />You believe that CO2 is evil because that's what the morons in the government and hollywood told you and you're too stupid to realize without it everything green would die.<br />You're a communist.<br /><br />You probably wont like this movie if:<br />You like original plots.<br />You don't want to watch a cartoon version of a movie that you've seen before.<br />You're not a communist.<br />You're not an idiot.<br />You don't like cats much less blue cats.<br />----<br /><br />Update:<br />------<br />  In all seriousness, even if you are not a communist or a smurf-lover, you may not completely hate this movie.  It can be appealing in a completely superficial way... much like soda.  However, as any smart person knows, soda will rot your teeth and give you diabetes.  So, be careful kiddos.
B003HKN51Q|5.0|Finally, the wait is over. Elvis on Tour released on DVD/Blu-Ray. Follow the King on his Early '72 Tour as he belts out Some contemporary tunes as well as his classic anthems. Originally slated to be called \\"Sold Out!\\" and then \\"Standing Room Only\\", this Golden Globe winner offers fans a rare glimpse into \\"behind the scenes\\" and on stage of an Elvis Presley 70's tour. In his lifetime Elvis performed nearly 1,200 live shows! All the excitement of an Elvis show is captured here. Catch Presley back stage rehearsing, recording in the studio and entertaining thousands of fans across the country! There is something for everybody in this film. It's just too bad that literally hours of footage from these tours remains locked away in the MGM vaults. Maybe someday we will get a deluxe treatment, but until then, we will have to settle for the original theatrical release of Elvis On Tour....\\"Ladies and Gentlemen, Elvis has NOT Left the building...not yet!\\"
0307463745|5.0|I wish it was possible to take everything said in Rework and apply it but it's not. Many of the advice/rules given in this book are contradicting. I envy these guys if they are indeed running a successful business so casually. I find it hard to see how you can have just a few people provide the best product and the best customer support and still leave at 5 every day...    It takes just a couple of hours to read this book. Everything they say is intelligent and mostly true. I greatly enjoyed the last two chapters. They provided many insights I did not think about. I wish I will keep all this wisdom in the back of my mind and use when possible.    Well, it's short, intelligent and well-written. I still think highly of 37signals and I would probably buy books they'll publish in the future - which means they implemented what they preached for perfectly. Well done.
B00068C7WA|4.0|There are several Billy Joel compilations, but as the only single disc collection covering his whole career, this fills an important niche. There is certainly no arguing with what is here; every song is excellent, and most are great. That said, Joel's solo career is remarkably consistent; he has dozens of songs that even the most casual fan should have. It is thus impossible for a single disc compilation to even approach doing him justice. Extreme casuals who come across this might consider it, but the more comprehensive Greatest Hits collections or The Essential Billy Joel are better buys.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I was huge into Anime several years ago and was snatching up Enavgelion on VHS as it was released and loved the series, then came death/rebirth and I was drawn back in.  I never picked it up on DVD but when i saw this Blu-ray release as an OVA style re-imagining of the series my interest was piqued.  Boy am I glad I picked this up!<br /><br />It i stunning looking and cuts through some of the slower pace of the original, which I'm not knocking, but as a revisitation of the story i think it's perfect so far.  I am waiting impatiently for the next part to be released.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This is an awesome television series.  I'm not even sure where to begin!  Do you cherish morals and ethics?  If so, this show is for you and your family!  You will be amazed by how determined these charecters are to help others in need, human nature at it's best.    The actors are amazing as well.  Bridget Regan is smart and beautiful... seriously.      Hope you enjoy!

B0030Y11XS|1.0|You have to give him credit. Mr. Moore makes a low budget, low quality film that rakes in millions. He brings up some good points. But his logic is often flawed and his comparisons are too often silly. Once more he has come up with a comedy propaganda tool mislabeled as a documentary. And he has conned millions into paying money to watch it. Then he claims he is not a Capitalist. Can you spell hypocrite?    Mr. Moore's solution to all of our problems seems to be some kind of populist democracy. Not sure where the financial system fits into his imaginary world? He is not very clear on that point. But, we will all have good jobs, lots of money and a great life when his new world appears. I can hardly wait. Maybe we can use Cuba or   Venezuala for our model? Don't look at the crime rate in Caracas or the standard of living in Cuba though, or you might be disillusioned.    Take a look at \\"Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man\\" by Hardy and Clarke for another viewpoint on Mr. Moore's books, films and tactics.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|M.K.continues to make astounding albums one after another. He is the almighty \\"annointed one\\" when it comes to brilliant records, playing ability, and beautiful lyrical messages. Better vocalists exist no doubt, as well as more dynamic on-stage performers,  BUT NO ONE is on the same planet as M.K. in overall musical ability and an innate knack to continue to crank em' out, all the while out-doing himself each time!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen.  I am so glad it was inexpensive.  The acting was fair, the story line was virtually invisible, and the cinematography was (well if you could call it that) terrible!
0307276902|4.0|If you're not hung up on how much is fact and how much is fiction, it's an entertaining read!  I liked it and got through it in a matter of days!  I didn't realize that this book was controversial until I had already read it and went to give it a review on here.  I'm glad the part of him getting his teeth done with no pain killers was probably part of the \\"fiction\\" because that was very disturbing.
1416955070|5.0|I love this trilogy!  While there are many familiar characters (vampires, warewolves, warlocks, etc.) they are not the main focus of the story (which is a bit of a relief!).  The main character is Clary, a 15-year-old girl who has just discovered that she has shadowhunter blood.  Shadowhunters, or the Nephilim, are humans with angel blood in their veins.  Set in present day New York, Clare does an excellent job of capturing the teenage protagonists thoughts, actions, reactions, interactions, etc.  The realism of the story and the storytelling may have you wondering if all of this is happening right under our noses, in the parks and subways of New York City.    If you're looking for a good YA fantasy trilogy, that isn't centered around vampires, check out The Mortal Instruments trilogy.
0786838655|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kind of reminds me of a combination of Harry Potter and The Parent Trap. I like that it incorporates mythology; I don't know if it has the same effect on it's target audience (10 and up), but it definitely made me want to learn more about mythology.    If you are looking for a fun story and a quick read, give The Lightning Thief a try!
1400032717|5.0|This book was just utterly amazing, it sucked me in and I could to stop reading. It was a teacher who brought it up and she said that afterward she had been a bit strange and been looking for red cars cos they had a meaning in this book. I on the other hand started to philosophy about black holes, white holes, God, the big bang and how I am related to the wall...yes I get weird when I stay up late.<br /><br />I think it was cos this book was so strange, and I have no idea how to review it.<br /><br />This book is not only text, it is filled with little maps, lists, math problems, and signs that Christopher sees. They fit perfectly cos that is how he is. Maybe I should make a list.<br /><br />1.Christoper is 15 and has aspberger's<br />2. He does not like yellow or brown, and he does not want to touch those colors.<br />3. He does not like to be touched.<br />4. 4 red  cars in a row means it will be a good day, 4 yellow a bad day.<br />5. He loves math and is really good at it.<br />6. The food must not touch.<br />7. He does not like strangers.<br /><br />That is Christopher. He lives with his dad because his mum died. He is in school and will get an A in the A-level math. One day he finds his neighbors dog killed with a garden fork and decides that he will find out who killed the dog. This will lead him outside his house and to talk to strangers, and he does not quit even though his dad tells him to. Even though he can't tell lies.<br /><br />It was a lovely book, a strange book, a book that jumped between things. It felt like I was in his mind, and I can only say that this is a great creation by Mark Haddon. A truly wonderful tale that also made me really sad in places. The mystery is great, but there is also other things happening, and it is just something you have to read.<br /><br />I can only say that I am glad I liked this book. I read that it was simultaneously published for adults and YA so both can read this tale. So go and read it. I hope you will find it as mesmerizing as I did.
B002C1BHIO|2.0|This product has a terrific price for what you get. VERY strong, sturdy cable. However, the cable I received caused signal interference with some of my other things, which means the cable probably was not properly shielded. Also, the signal I got on the t.v. from it would go blank every few minutes, and then come back on, which is probably caused from improper wiring and/or connection. So buyer beware!    Full kudos to Amazon for their very easy and friendly customer policies, and their very simple refund and return system.
0765350386|3.0|I wanted to try Sanderson ever since I read that he would complete WOT. Now I can see that the style is totally different. And I dunno why but I'd like to call this sci-fi fantasy, yes nothing sci-fi about it except for this feeling I got. That this is not a fantasy world, it could just be a world out there. But that is just me and perhaps it was all the metal magic.<br /><br />This is the story about Vin, a thief living and hiding in the big city. She is skaa, the slaves of the world. An owner can take a woman and kill her the next day, because the gods forbid if a halfbreed was ever born. Which of course she is. Some get away, but the slave population is tired after 1000 years of slavery. It all started with the man now known as the Lord Ruler, the all mighty god that rule them all with an iron fist. He granted those who supported him 1000 years ago special rights and they are now the nobility, the rest, slaves, all owned by him and to be used by the noble families at their whim.<br /><br />One day a man comes, Kelsier, with mighty plans to kill the Lord Ruler and bring the Skaa out of slavery. But how can you kill a god? Even if Kelsier is a mistborn, he has magic because of his half blood lineage, just as Vin has. Soon she is thrust into another world and will see if The Lord Ruler is a God, and if his guards are as immortals are the legends say.<br /><br />I liked Vin, even if she does get a bit stupid later on thinking that the nobility isn't as bad as people have told her.

B0036B8MXC|5.0|This is not your mom and dad's Spartacus. It's bloody, very sexual, vulgar at times, ruthlessly plot driven and gritty. Historically acurate? I don't know but given what I know of ancient Roman history, a society to whom sex and fear were an everyday, it's not far off from what your imagination could give you. You're watching the beginnings of THE Roman slave rebellion, it wasn't a pretty thing and the show flat out warns to the fact that it is supposed to be as historically acurate as it can be. From the previews themseleves you can see what kind of show this is meant to be, something about it is akin to \\"300\\" the movie in terms of action sequences and blood letting, but it's the plot that draws you in. The characters are engrossing, everyone has their own agendas and someone will always get screwed over by them, the best part is just seeing whom and how. So to recap, it's bloody and brutal, sexually driven, plot driven by historical accounts and what little was actually known of who the real Spartacus was and made up story of who the man may have been and what he went through. Flat out, don't like blood, sex and swearing with a good plot, this show is past your bed time. Otherwise, Starz, you've created something phenominal! Can't wait to see what happens next!
B0001US8FI|5.0|Probably the best Martial arts film ever made. But in this addition the additional dick with the interviews makes it even better. Jim Kelly and John Saxon are also very good in this film and of coarse Bruce at his best. The speculation as to his death is both interesting and disturbing. It is discussed in the interview portion of this DVD as well.
B0017U0APC|3.0|In reading all of the reviewer's comments on this CD- I was able to find the 2 CD version (there is also a 3 CD version)  Anyone reading this already knows the talent, diversity, etc. of the genius of Van Morrison. I would only like to note briefly that I understand that Universal Japan is in process of releasing 18 Van titles in the ShM (format- I think)-the ShM is great compared to the junk re-issues and obviously the original releases.   I will wait to pick those up as it is worth the wait. I did purchase Street Choir (Japan 2008- need to know the serial # to get the proper remastered one as there are several out there (see the Moondance Import- Reviewer and he lets you know what that is) Street Choir was like listening to totally new songs whether it be the Sax, Hammond B-3, the acoustic rhythm guitar (fantasic- hardly even noticible in the others) and the Bass- fantastic and all the percussion instruments- gave this CD a real sense of being in the studio- with a bang  That's what I have been waiting for-     Who could ask for more? Just great songs over his recording period in their best remastered quality?    So, hopefully this info helps some- the problem with this is the price- who knows what it will be    The only other (and better)solution is to put together all of his titles in a Box Set in 2 formats. #1- A box with the Cd's and and excellent booklet of info, etc. and #2 A special Limited Edition (#'d)Box with all the Cd's, an expanded hard 12\\" by 12\\" booklet (e.g.- like Bear Family does) with a heavy dose of rarities- (demo's, alternates, live, etc)  This will finally allow all the fans happy- the Limited Edition would be #'d so the Record Co. would not lose money and the Box would fly out- Then you could have this done in the new ShM format and make it reasonable in price  Billy Boy    This is excellent and will quell all those fans who want and deserve much more of Van's great music properly remastered.  The only thing is the price-
0446563048|4.0|First the facts: Tony Hsieh is smarter than your average guy, and willing to work hard. He had an early dot com success, made some money, and squandered most of it partying. He gave Zappos its first funding, then later became the company's CEO, and led Zappos to tremendous success before it was purchased by Amazon for over one billion dollars. This book chronicles those events.<br /><br />If you know anything about Zappos, you know they have an almost insane commitment to customer satisfaction. You may not know that they have an intense corporate culture around the theme of \\"Delivering Happiness.\\" This book also explores both of these topics in some detail.<br /><br />However, this is NOT an in-depth analysis of how to run an internet retailer. While IT, inventory, financing, drop shipping, vendor relationships, pricing, etc. are all discussed as the story unfolds, none are covered in any detail. This book is about Tony's experiences and growth in building Zappos. He does not attempt to instruct you how to do the same.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, and learned a number of useful lessons. Tony's analogies comparing poker and businesses were somewhat of an eye opener. What particularly shocked me was how little preparation or research went into some of their most important decisions. It seems that, at least in Zappo's case, smart people with the ability to quickly change direction after recognizing a mistake can do as well or better than most companies who do deep analysis and diligence in advance.<br /><br />Highly recommended insider tale of how Zappos succeeded. Just don't expect any analysis, because there isn't any.

030726839X|4.0|Max Hastings, like many British historians, has only a superficial and somewhat distorted understanding of the United States and more specifically its attitude at the outbreak of WW2 and the adoption of a policy of American \\"neutrality.\\" His well presented portrait of Churchill, strengths,warts and all, is authoritative when presenting Churchill in the European and British context but is marred by his failure to understand that not only was the United States reluctant to get involved in the war between the UK and Nazi Germany, but the American public was overwhelmingly against any involvement. Churchill's only strategy to win the war, as argued by Hastings, was to somehow get the US involved as an active belligerent ally since he recognized that Britain was incapable of defeating Germany on its own. The fact that the US eventually entered the war against Hitler is not proof that Churchill's strategy actually worked. Indeed, Churcill had absolutely nothing to do with the US's declaration of war against Nazi Germany. After the \\"dastardly' attack by the Japanese on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, FDR could only secure a declaration of war against the empire of Japan. In no way did or would Congress have given him such a declaration against Germany. It was only when Hitler, along with Italy some four days later, declared war against the US that FDR could secure a declaration of war against Germany and Italy. Absent Hitler's declaration, there was no way Congress would have declared war against Germany. Churchill had no hand in the US entrance into the war and it cannot be argued that his policy was a success. He could not have foreseen events as they unfolded. In a sense, he was lucky.

0596009208|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet as many of the other reviewers have the same thoughts as me. This is an excellent book, the fact that it is the first programming book that is not dry and boring to read caught me off guard. Don't get me wrong programming is enjoyable to do but to make it fun to learn is an accomplishment. The only suggestion I would have to go to the books web site [...] to get a digital copy of the code in the book. This will save some headache. I have only ran into inaccurate code once so far, I am about 75% done with the book. It was in chapter 12, midi code, of the book.     If you are already experienced with C/C++ the first 25% or so of the book will be review as much of the syntax in Java is the same as C/C++. However, I would still recommend making a least a good \\"once over\\" of the first few chapters of the book as there are some subtle differences. Anyway, great book for those who are just learning Java.
0446567337|5.0|This is a romantic drama book about a soldier who falls for a conservative college student while he's home on leave. We really like this book because it is romantic, sappy, sad, redeeming, and a little comedic in between. This is a love story about an army sergeant who falls in love shortly before 9/11. Dear John starts in the present day with John watching Savannah from afar and thinking about how much he loves her and why their relationship dissolved. He then takes the reader back in time and narrates the story of their love.
0307271862|2.0|While I was able to get through the book without falling to sleep and it kept me fairly entertained, the author never revealed why the particular village in Sweden was chosen to avenge perceived past wrongs. This was the books major sin. I also found Mankell's apparent fondness for Robert Mugabe disquieting. There were also countless stereotypes of the Chinese as well.      This is the author's worst book in my opinion.
1589944607|5.0|Where to begin? First, if you haven't seen the show, how dare you? BSG was repeatedly snubbed at the emmys for a being a Sci-Fi original, because apparently they had better shows to nominate like CSI: Disneyland or whatever inane spinoff they had. So first go watch the show, seriously, I'll wait.    Back? Ok, now that you've seen the best TV show in the past 10 years you will appreciate this game so much more, and even if you still have not seen it, you will still enjoy playing. Seriously, I have played mulitiple times with people who have never even seen one episode and they get a kick out of this game almost every time.    \\"Almost\\" every time you say? Unfortunately, this game is seriously unbalanced in a 4 or 6 player game. It is at its best with 3 or 5 players. Why? Because depending on the human resource dials on the gameboard and where they are pointing at the mid-game point, there will be either 2 cylons vs 2 humans or 1 cylon vs 3 humans (for a 4 player game); 3 cylons vs 3 humans or 2 cylons vs 4 humans in a 6 player game. With half the players as cylons, the humans are severely outmatched, and with more humans they can walk all over the cylon player(s). This mechanic is negated in a 3 or 5 player game, in which there is a set number of cylon players by the mid-game point.    The best part of this game is definitely the deceptive nature of how players manipulate other players. If you're a cylon in disguise your best bet is to sow distrust amongst the other human players and if possible get them to accuse each other of betrayal and send each other to prison while you subtlely ruin their chances of progressing and attacking their resources. If you are a human player, you are constantly suspicious of other players, which makes for some interesting choices as you will sometimes make reckless decisions to imprison a suspected cylon or speed up the game in order to keep the cylons from having more turns to mess you up.    Basically this game presents a ticking clock for players. When the clock reaches zero, the choices they have made will culminate into victory or loss. But what you do, if you're human or cylon, from start to finish is almost always satisfying because most playthroughs are won or lost by the skin of your teeth, creating a enjoyably tense atmosphere. You must at least TRY this game, and you must BUY it if you're a fan of the show.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|Dont even bother watching this. I watched 20 min into it and i threw away my dvd. Waste of money. How can people watch this and think its good, or even give it a 2 star or more rating? Oh yea, we live in a world full of retards and hopeless romantics. Just like this movie, my first question would be for the people who were in the movie? How in the hell could you disgrace yourself. Its nothing but lust and its sickens me. This movie shouldn't even be on amazon, it should be put into a fire place and burned.     I only watched it cause my friend recommended it to me as the worst movie you could ever see. I couldn't stand watching it for more then 20 min. Its not even a movie with a story line its that pathetic.
1595141715|4.0|Review #1: Th1rteen R3asons Why, a novel by Jay Asher, is an amazing book that gives you an almost nervous curiosity throughout the entire book. The strongest literary device in this book is the flashbacks.  The entire book is one big flashback of Hanna Baker's high school life. Clay is listening to Hanna describe her life during high school. She tells thirteen different stories about all different people; if your name is mentioned on the tape, you should be one of the people who have heard the tape. It is hard to start but the ending is worth it. During the course of this book, the main boy, Clay, is listening to the voice of a dead girl, Hanna. Hanna was in high school with Clay when she committed suicide and she recorded tapes that she sent to a list of people before she swallowed a handful of pills. The people she sends the tapes to are supposed to listen to her thirteen reasons why she committed suicide. Jay Asher does an incredible job of describing Clay's and Hanna's feeling throughout the book. I'm just warning you, you have to really commit yourself to this book at the beginning because it is hard to start but once you get into it the story gets much better and makes more sense.    Review #2:   Thirteen is often known as an unlucky number. In the book, Thirteen Reasons Why, by Jay Asher, it shows why thirteen is an unlucky number. Asher uses plot, characters and point of view to tell this eerie, soulful story. The plot of this book consists of thirteen stories that push a girl to commit suicide. As the stories progress the reader will start to crave for the next story. The writing is appropriately descriptive making the plot interesting and unable to put down. The characters in this book range very differently in personality. The main character, Clay, is a teenage boy that happens to be one of Hannah Bakers's thirteen reasons to commit suicide. Clay's character makes you want to keep reading the book because he can not imagine what he did to hurt Hannah Baker. By the end of the book, the reader will be able to predict the next move a character might make because of the connection that they have made. The point of view of this book is very original. The point of view is from Hannah Baker after she has died. She has dedicated a cassette tape to all of her thirteen reasons telling them why she killed herself. Since she knows that she is going to kill herself, she is able to say whatever she wants to. Jay Asher has written a novel that will make you ponder the meaning of life, death and your impact on others. He was successful at this because of the way he wrote and developed the plot, characters, and point of view.  Thirteen seems like a decent amount, but when it is all bad luck, it might just push someone to the edge.
B0000942HV|3.0|If I had never heard the original, I probably would have liked this more.  Just as I hate movie reviews which talk about the book it was based on, I tried to hear this on its own.  As such it is OK, but it has no feeling and does not connect with the history of the original.      One interesting thing you can do with this since it is broken up into 17 tracks (which is otherwise annoying) is you can play it on randomize and listen to it all out of sequence.  Very odd.
0375836675|5.0|I Am the Messenger is a story about an Average Joe whose name is Ed Kennedy.  He doesn't have anything special in life except his dog,the Doorman, and his three best friends.  One day he gets a card in the mail and this starts the great journey in which Ed travel. Throughout this book you will see the use of theme, characters and the protagonist (Ed). Theme is the lesson or moral of a story and in this book there is a new one on every page. Markus Zusak does not just write this book to entertain you; he triggers the depth of your soul and makes you really think about the meaning of success. One line in this book that I think of as a good example of theme is \\"Maybe everyone can live beyond what they're capable of.\\" (Zusak 357) After reading this book I wanted to go out and help anyone I could. Each character in this book has something special that makes you remember them. I won't give away any names of characters but each person is so unique and down-right interesting that you can't help but wonder how Markus Zusak made all of them up. \\"She looks at me, and she has sunshine-colored hair in a pony tail and clear eyes, like water.\\"  (Zusak 61) These characters become so real that the reader sometimes forgets that they're fictional. Ed Kennedy, a cabdriver who never had much of a future, gives this book life and I would have not have loved this book if he had not been in it. He is the real hero in this book; he makes the so called \\"miracles\\" come true.  Ed gives others hope and inspires them to do the things that they couldn't have done alone. Markus Zusak inspired me through his use of theme, characters, and the protagonist.
0671027344|2.0|Much, I'm sure, to the author's pleasure, this book has gotten a lot of attention as it has made the \\"Top 5\\" most frequently censored books in school libraries, or whatever.  This is because, unlike most teen novels, the book deals with themes of masturbation, homosexuality, and drug abuse.<br /><br />Sadly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.  This never actually struck me as the honest voice of a teenager (it's written in first-person epistolary style).  The whole thing sounded more like an adult trying to sound like a teenager, if you get what I mean.  In other words, it seemed like the book was filled with concerns and confusions that adults believe teenagers to be having, rather than being informed by an actual teenage worldview.

When paired with The Power of a Positive No, GTY gives readers a solid foundation in principled negotiations.

And I can do it while holding my head up high, knowing that my negotiations are equitable and don't rely on sleaze tactics.

0812973992|5.0|This was such a well written book, it was amazing how he was able to weave the stories together in the most unusual ways. It always surprised me. The book was very emotional and I was involved with the story right away. This book is very impressive, Colum McCann was able to tell two stories at one time and you are able to see both pictures at the same time, that is good writing. I would have liked the ending to be expanded a little. It seems authors will write detailed accounts during the begining of a book and as it ends there is the feeling I have to get out quickly, if I were an editor I would have encourage some authors to take a little more time before they leave the story; not a lot but a few more paragrphs would do it. In spite of this flaw I would higly recommend this book.
B001BN1VIA|1.0|This is the WORST sounding CD i have ever heard, HANDS DOWN!! What's with these other reviews that the audiophile freaks say is sounding good on this cd? Even Ian himself has admitted there is no good master of Aqualung available anywhere. The original master was destroyed and an inferior master was used. This album was recorded in an old church turned into a studio where the sound and acoustics were terrible. Led Zeppelin had the same studio except a smaller room which made the sound better and more intimate. I have to turn my cd player up all the way on volume just to hear it. Ian himself says this is not one of their better releases in their day. Stand Up and Benefit blow this away. Not to say there isn't great songs on this release if only you could hear them. What a shame NONE of the Jethro Tull catalog has been remastered properly. I guess i'll try the Tull blu-spec cd and see how that sounds.

0307454541|2.0|I finally finished this book and I can honestly say good riddance.  I was in total shock when I decided to write a review of this book and discovered all the positive post. I respect every ones opinion and realize not everyone likes the same thing but to call this book an international bestselling sensation and wildly suspenseful IMO is a big stretch.  I have read more suspenseful tales in my local newspaper. The only thing that kept me turning the pages was Salander, by the middle of the book I was skim reading Blomkvist parts.  He was so boring and the author did such a poor job in describing him I never had a clear mental picture of what he looked like.  I also could not understand what made him a chick magnet.  Almost every women he came in contact with below the age of 60 he slept with. It made no sense and did not add any value to the plot.  Also where was the all consuming family saga? The Vanger family members were never all in the same room or interacted with each other. They were just stick people with names that appeared through out the book to warn Blomkvist to stop investigating Harriet's disappearance. Harriet poor Harriet, what happened to her 30 yrs ago.....who cares. The search to find out what happened was so boring and drawn out I fell asleep a few times, about 300 pages should have been edited out. There was no sense of urgency or dread just around the corner. When Blomkvist is tortured I thought that's it, this is all you got, I'm suppose to compare this book to The Red Dragon and Silence Of The Lambs by Thomas Harris, please. Another problem was the character Wennerstrom, you are told who he is but not once does he actualy appear in the book, he is not described or speaks. But we are to believe he is the catalyst that drives this story. Strange.<br /><br />I know this author can write because he created Salander a character I loved and wanted to read more about. At times I felt the author did not know who he wanted to be the main character. I understand the next books are about her which is great. If you are looking for a great suspense/thriller skip this book and read RD or SOTL by Thomas Harris or just read the newspaper headlines.nd the next books are about her which is great.

0385341075|5.0|A New Zealand writer has produced a highly entertaining and well written novel in Mr. Pip. The title comes from the main character in Charles Dickens's wonderful novel, Great Expectations.  The narrator is a young black adolescent, named Matilda, and she is bright and open to all the ideas of the world that her eager mind can absorb. She is just entering puberty, living on an island in Papua New Guinea. She lives with her mother and is an only child. Her father left the home to work in Australia but has never returned. Her mother, a rigid woman, has developed a hard shell to protect herself from hurt. Unfortunately this sets the stage for distance between the mother and daughter. Matilda's teacher is a mysterious white man, married to a black woman. Much of the novel involves the gradual discovery over time of the true identity of this man, Mr. Watts.  His wife, Grace, appears to be suffering from depression.  With few school books or other academic resources, Mr. Watts teaches the island children, from Great Expectations. The main character of the novel, Pip, captures Matilda's imagination and soon she reflects about her own experiences and compares them to the experiences of Pip.  As the influence of Great Expectations increases for Matilda, her mother becomes concerned and a rivalry develops between Mr. Watts and Matilda's mother Dolores.  This novel is about the power of the narrative to not only entertain but to allow reflection on personal experience. Life is so full of many experiences, many of which we barely have time to remember, or analyze. The power of novels is their ability to help people, at a conscious or unconscious level, organize their experiences and put meaning or new meaning on life experiences. There is a wonderful passage in this novel where Great Expectations disappears and the students, with the help of Mr. Watts, reconstructions the story. The story is more than just a parable on the power of the narrative form, though this is certainly acharacteristic of this novel. The scenes where the children reconstruct the novel from memory or the scenes where Mr. Watts agrees to tell the military insurgents the story of Mr. Pip every night for 6 nights are brilliant. The early chapters where island life and myth infiltrate the story line and dialogue are magical. The final chapters where Matilda is an adult and reflects upon her childhood are beautifully written. This novel is highly recommended.

0307592839|4.0|Brief summary and review, no spoilers.<br /><br />This book consists of several interrelated stories that bounce around in time and place. What these stories share are the characters, who we see go from youthful vitality and naivety to, well, what happens next - getting older. We see young punk rockers go from rock stars to aging decrepit old men trying to get some of that youthful vigor back. We are introduced to a whole group of people, who will intersect with each other in these stories - and we are led full circle as we get a glimpse of them at different times in their lives with different partners and friends. By the end of this novel we are left reeling from the feeling of having experienced the passage of time on so many lives as we reflect as on our own human condition.<br /><br />This is such a difficult book to describe as far as plot. In the beginning, we are introduced to Sasha, a beautiful young kleptomaniac who lives in New York. Sasha is in a psychiatrist's office talking about this problem. She soon goes out on a date with a young man named Alex, with whom she spends one night. We subsequently meet Benny, Sasha's boss, who runs a successful record production company. As we read further we revisit them  and we go on to meet a whole additional cast of characters as we go back and forth from the days of punk rock to an interesting view of a future beyond our present.<br /><br />When you finish this unusual novel you are left with a deeper understanding of what makes these characters tick and why they became the people they did. We also see how the process of aging effects us all -  the experience being unique and yet predictable at the same time. We see what is in fashion and cool one day may not be just a few years or a generation later.<br /><br /> Even though we are only given small vignettes and stories about their lives, it is enough to put together enough pieces of the puzzle to get a view of the whole. It's an interesting effect and I know I'll be thinking about this book for a long time.<br /><br />I do recommend this novel. I especially recommend it for those of you (me) who are old enough to remember the days of punk rock, and who will appreciate how time has changed us all. In the book, one of the characters makes the statement that \\"time's a goon, right?\\" Hence the title. A goon indeed.<br /><br />Also recommended, this author's previous books, The Keep (gothic and eerie), and Look at Me.a long time.    I do recommend this novel.

I have even clipped it to the collar on the back of my shirt while gardening.  haven't  tried the armband yet. The clear plastic case is invisible and does not interfere with using it.  Don't hesitate to buy this. It won't disappoint you.
B000002WMH|5.0|I had lost this box set of Elvis in moving.      It is as I remembered it as a great collection of Elvis songs that were recorded from his early years or the 50's.    The recordings show the development of Elvis as he progressed through those years.
B003IYNDJA|4.0|Having followed the group since J.E.E.P., Stereophonics has been one of the more standout groups to come out of the UK over the past decade. Sure, the music may always be original, but they're catchy & the lead singer has an incredible voice. If you don't believe me, find their cover of \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" and try to tell me they're not incredibly talented. Well, now the band has released a new album that slightly evolves their sound, which has finally come to America in the form of K.C.C.O.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />She's Alright<br />Beerbottle<br />Trouble<br />Uppercut<br /><br />Stereophonics is the same band as ever, really. They still rock, they still do a great ballad, and they can pretty much do everything in-between. Really, the only changes are lack of any electronic elements, and the fact they sound more like & take their musical inspiration from Coldplay instead of U2 this time. Stereophonics has modernized itself a little bit, but it's not like you'd really notice that much anyways.<br /><br />Overall, a solid but unspectacular album from the Stereophonics. Fans & those who don't know of the band should give it a whirl, but if you're not a fan, this will do nothing to change your mind since it's just a slight change from their previous material.
B00005MP58|5.0|Yes, I know that is a totally silly and sexist review title, but you would have to be a eunuch NOT to become totally smitten with Colin Firth after seeing this adaptation of Austen's revered work. He IS Mr. Darcy! Okay, okay, okay, so much for my drooling.  I have purchased this DVD several times as a special gift for people who love a great British costume period classic.  Never have I had one complaint! Could it be due to the talented cast, lush setting/scenery and wonderful work it originally came from?  That would be a \\"YES!\\".  If you are in an Austen mood I highly recommend [[ASIN:B00000G3AZ Emma]] and [[ASIN:0800141660 Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)]]<br /><br />Jolly Good Show!
B002MUAJ2A|2.0|This book does have some good ideas, although poorly justified. They have some good points about meetings, people selection, and strategic planning. The rest is pure ignorance.  They prescribe things that worked for them. But these things worked because they were lucky, not because their approach works. For example, they critique advertising and state that blogging is a better way to get your name out there. What they forget is that they already had a well known blog, made popular by one of their employees (the creator of ruby on rails). So, the blogging strategy works for them, but not anyone else. They talk about offering less and charging more. It works because of how they accidentally positioned themselves. The key here is accidental. They positioned themselves correctly out of ignorance, not because their approach is so brilliant. They talk about not having documentation. It works because they have 5 employees. Try running a development team with 10,000 people.    They are smart people and it's a fun read. But I wouldn't use this book as a prescription for how to run a business.
B0006ZFQNA|2.0|I find it strange that some reviewers are blaming Berganza for ruining this recording, calling her cold, boring, bloodless... she indeed is all of the above, but so too is Domingo, Milnes and Cotrubas, all of these extremely respectable singers are unusually boring to listen to here. This is a very strong cast of singers; blame ultimately lies in the far too lightweight and shallow conducting of Abbado. I find it laughable to suggest that typical Abbado is boring, but even the best conductors will occasionally turn out flops, and this is certainly one of Abbado's biggest and most disappointing flops. In addition, the often overpolished and too soft production that wreaks many of Abbado's recordings is more evident here than in any of his recordings.<br /><br />As far as dialogue Carmen goes (YES RECRETIVO CARMENS ARE ALL GARBAGE) Solti's Carmen is probably the best; Troyanos/Domingo/van Dam/Te Kanawa is a mouth-watering cast that delivers and Solti's passionate and powerful conducting is far superior to Abbado's. The somewhat underrated Maazel recording is worth mentioning too, either way there are lots of Carmen which are far superior to Abbado's.
1416955070|4.0|The writing is adolescent and predictable.  She uses simile and metaphor too frequently, and often inappropriately.  At times it seemed as though she would use the thesaurus to find the most obscure word possible.  My initial review of this book rather shredded it, but I still have it on my reading ipod and listen to it when I have nothing else.  The later books start to be a stretch, but in general for the first three books I have an attachment to the characters.
B000026FJ6|3.0|I bought Tubular Bells as a teenager and remember liking it at the time. A friend had Ommadawn and Hergest Ridge and I remember thinking they were good too. When I saw all the five star reviews I decided to revisit Mike Oldfield. I wouldn't say that I was disappointed - the very distinct guitar voice is still there - but I wasn't moved the way some reviewers seem to have been. I have two issues, each deducting one star: a) there aren't enough original thoughts to keep it going. Variations around the same theme are fine, but these variations aren't that subtle, and b) am I the only person to think this album is Enigma without the vocals? Oh wait, there are the same chanting vocals in places.     It's sometimes hard to review a 1994 release in 2010, because you forget what came before, and what influenced what. This is a lyrical album - I'm just not sure how memorable it is.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|This movie is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and it also gives the viewer a glimpse into the world of nineteenth century Britain and the young queen who would come to define an era. Emily Blunt's portrayal of Queen Victoria in her youth is brilliantly wrought with emotion, strength, weakness and romance and a gamut of other emotions which the young queen certainly experienced. The movie captured with accuracy the prison like atmosphere and the tumultuous relationships that the young Victoria lived through.<br /><br />I found the pacing of the movie did not drag the story down. While there may be no question of the outcome of Victoria and Albert's courtship the political and social intrigue and vying for control, power and position that surrounded the circumstances of their relationship does keep the viewer caught up in the drama of their lives with great interest.<br /><br />The production values, the acting and the directing are all top notch my only complaints are with the historical inaccuracies. Generally I am not one to complain too much about historical inaccuracies in Hollywood films but a few in particular really change the tone of this film.<br /><br />The first one is prince Albert's love for Victoria. The film makes it seem like Albert was a love-sick puppy pinning away for Victoria until she came to her senses and agrees to marry him. In reality Victoria fell very hard in love with Albert after she had about 3 years on the throne enjoying her single status. But Albert was a bit ambivalent about coming to England and marrying Victoria. His love for her was something that developed more after their marriage than before. Also, Albert was not hurt in the real life assassination attempt on Victoria and having him injured as depicted in the movie seemed a bit too manipulative. With Albert being the love struck puppy the entire nature of the relationship changes as does the tone of the film. It does give the movie a feel of a romance novel aimed at a certain demographic. I don't think that was necessary because the truth of the story has enough drama and romance to make it satisfying.<br /><br />I also didn't care for how the relationship between Victoria and her first prime minister, Lord Melbourne, was depicted. In this movie he seems like a manipulative smarmy character. In reality he was much older than depicted in this movie and although there was mutual love and respect between the two, and Victoria may well have had a crush on him, Lord Melbourne actually played more of a fatherly and mentor role with her. I much prefer the relationship as depicted in the A&E mini-series Victoria & Albert by Victoria Hamilton and Sir Nigel Hawthorne. [[ASIN:B00005O7N8 Victoria & Albert]]<br /><br />But all in all the movie was very well made and acted despite the historical inaccuracies and it is well worth viewing or owning on DVD.k that was necessary because the truth of the story has enough drama and romance to make it satisfying.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|WOW!  I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I wish that I had seen it in the theater on the big screen.  This movie was very different and certainly right up my alley with the \\"energy\\" component.  It has awesome scenery, gadgets, and creatures.  It's about metaphysical energy, the spirits of animals, and our connectedness to nature and each other.  It's also about the terrible things men do for greed.<br /><br />There are a group of approximately 12 foot blue people who live on planet Pandora.  They live in peace with nature and the land, and live in appreciation and respect for all life forms (shamanistic principles).  They are very much in sync with the energy vibrations of each other and spiritual beings. There is a mineral that the earth wants that Pandora has called unobtanium and this grey rock is worth $20 mil a kilo.  Earth has brought a bunch of mercenary soldiers to Pandora determined to get unobtainium any way they can.<br /><br />The Avatar program is earth's attempt to bond with the blue people and learn as much about them as possible, to use the knowledge against them. An Avatar body is part human DNA and part blue people.  Each program participant has their own avatar linked to their DNA, so they can interact together as one.  To activate the Avatar body, you lock down into an electronic bed and meditate out.  Then the Avatar body awakens, hence the name \\"Dreamwalker\\" by the locals.<br /><br />Jake Sully is a young wheel-chair bound marine who received spinal injuries while fighting for his country.  His brother, Tom, was a scientist who signed up for the Avatar program.  When Tom died, the contract was offered to Jake because Jake has the same DNA (that was already linked to the Avatar body).<br /><br />Grace is Sigourney Weaver, the scientist running the scientific part of the program. Colonel Miles Quaritch is running the military section and he is a tough dude. He asks Sully to get inside the blue people's heads and get him what info he needs to be able to control or conquer them and he will get Sully his legs back when Sully rotates home. (The operation is too expensive for Jake to handle alone.)  The blue peopl's village is right on the richest deposit of unobtanium.  Jake has 3 months before the bulldozers get there to befriend the blue people and convince them to move out of the way.<br /><br />So, like a good little soldier, Jake heads to the dangerous Pandora forest with Grace and others.  Running from a wild beast and barely escaping, Jake is lost in the jungle overnight where he is helped by Neytiri (father is clan leader/chief; mother is a spiritual leader/shaman).  Eywa is their name for God.  After a spiritual sign, Neytiri introduces Jake to her parents and they assign Neytiri to teach Jake to be one of them.  It's really cool to watch Jake learn the spiritual oneness that these people offer.  As Jake learns from and appreciates the magnificent beauty in their culture, he begins to realize the \\"war\\" with the blue people is all about greed.<br /><br />There is so much in this movie to appreciate.  The concepts of tying into the energy of all living things, living in peace and gratitude, sharing energy, that we are all connected and all energy beings, that there is a supreme spiritual being and spiritual helpers, the concept of taming your dragon--so much here that I already believe.  My sincerest appreciation to the writer/director James Cameron for putting this movie out for the world to see.<br /><br />Even if it is all just sci-fi fantasy to you, the storyline is great!  The colors are brilliant, the creativity is fantastic, the computer graphic imaging and animation is remarkable.  I think this movie has something for everybody.  I loved it.  It's a movie that leaves you thinking about it. I know I will watch this movie many times.<br /><br />2009/2010--162 minutes<br /><br />Note--My son said he saw a \\"making of\\" special on tv.  They hired a professor to make up some words to use as the blue people's language.  The professor developed a whole new language just for this movie!  Is that cool or what!  You will see the language woven into the movie with English subtitles.<br /><br />Note#2--I see where another reviewer said a lot of footage was cut out.  Not having watched it in the theater, I was not aware anything was missing. Although I am anxious to see what was cut, I loved this movie as shown.or this movie!  Is that cool or what!

0143038419|1.0|Let me first preface this review by stating that anytime you read a memoir, you are reading that person's vision of themself and their life. A good part of the story is also about spirituality and that's not for everybody either.  That being said, this lady really likes herself.  Me - not so much.    I had a hard time feeling the least bit sorry for her - she is unhappily married, but will not share why.  She goes to great lengths to tell us she gave her ex hubby whatever he wanted in the divorce, sounding like she was being magnanamous, but it just sounded like a payoff to me.  This unhappiness, leads her to a journey across the world.  I call it running away.      First she goes to Italy, where she eats great food, but doesn't really enjoy all that Italy has to offer.  Then off to India to stay in an Ashram where she meets strange and wonderful people.  Her final stop is in Bali where she meets an older man and falls in love with him.    Part of the reason I don't like her story is because I could never conceive of taking off on a selfish quest to find myself when I have left unfinished business behind.  She came across as self absorbed instead of on a search for who she really is.    In reading this book, you would think that everbody she meets just loves her.  I can't believe this is the case, especially in all these locations that are so different from the US.  I almost wonder if she made up some of these people to please her publisher.     This author clearly has a flair for writing.  I just wish I liked this book.

0385504225|4.0|I must say overall this book is a good and interesting read. Dan Brown has become an expert at piecing together mysteries of symbology and ancient legends. I bought this for my kindle and couldn't put it down. Definitely an excellent book to be the first one read on it. I will say however at times this book does lag a bit. It seems like every major twist (even the biggest one) I figured out a few chapters before the characters did. It is especially painfully slow in the beginning, however stick with it through the beginning and the pace of the story will pick up and keep your interest.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I loved the DualShock 2, and when I got my DS3 several months ago, I couldn't help but notice that Sony had made the choice to keep the outward profile of the L2 and R2 buttons of the DS2, despite having proportional analog control. It made them feel very strange, and I didn't like them very well. I got these a few days ago and they are heavenly. These correct the only thing wrong with the DS3. I know the 360  controller is pretty much king of the mountain right now, but had Sony implemented the style of triggers this product emulates, I think the DS3 could easily trump the 360 controller. The only thing that bothers me about them is that they LOOK like addons to the controller. The underside is exposed, showing the clip that holds the triggers to the controller. But the impact on gameplay and ergonomics is so worth it it's not even fair, and that statement doesn't even make sense. Just get them. They're 5 bucks. You will not be disappointed.

B0031S4K5E|5.0|As soon as my daughter saw Ponyo, she fell in love with it. She loves My Neighbor Totoro, The Cat Returns, Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery Service, so this was pretty much a safe bet with her. Getting the movie's already a good deal, but the plush Ponyo included here is of great quality, and easily beats any other Studio Ghibli plush I've seen [at least here in the US].    You can see right there in the stock picture how big Ponyo is since it's right next to the dvd in the packaging. It's made of a very soft, huggable material sure to comfort any child, and it's super cute. The material is easy to clean if anything gets dirty, and the construction is very sturdy. Of course there will be some issues with a longer 'skirt' here and there (that's quality control for you), but can you really turn away such a cute character even if it's suffering from such a thing? The plush Ponyo alone runs for about the cost of this set on most sites, so getting it included with the movie is great. While I would've liked them to give the blu-ray the same treatment, it's good to have on dvd since it's beautiful to watch on either format. And hey, most parents don't let 3 year olds handle 'expensive' movies, eh?    The dvd includes the usual special features that other Studio Ghibli dvds have- an interview with Miyazaki, a short featurette and a storyboard presentation of the entire movie. This is always a very important special feature for those interested in animation, or like to see the movie in a different format and seeing how it came together before the animators stepped in. And of course, the movie's in Japanese and English with Japanese, English, Spanish and French subtitles.    If you or your child(ren) love Ponyo, this is a must. I wish Disney would've given the recent re-re-releases of Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro the same kind of gift set. Now I'm kinda jealous that my daughter has her own Ponyo. Maybe I need to order one more?
0307271862|1.0|After a great series of books this is a major disappointment. It has no real mystery, and is full of fluff. For example, why in the world do we need to know that the protagonist sits is seat 22 B on her flight to Beijing? Dont spend your money. El Fusilero

B001BMXFX0|1.0|If you are going to read this book I suggest reading the first few chapters, skimming through the middle, and read the last few chapters.

I can't really say why I didn't like it without giving away the ending.
014241543X|1.0|I really struggled with this book.  It didn't delve into the characters enough for me to really feel so sad that I would fight back tears.  So, while the concept was sad, I just didn't feel it.  Matter-of-fact, at times, I felt as if the book needed to hurry up because it was too slow.  I also didn't care for the free-spirited \\"60's hippy\\" type aspect of the book... her being a classical musician, her family a bunch of rockers.  I didn't like how her parents were so relaxed about the sex and boyfriend sleeping over while she was clearly still a teen and in high school.  Overall, not a book I would recommend reading.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad is absolutely some of the best television available today. The cast is outstanding and the box set is full of extras!  LOVE IT!!
B001P9KR8U|5.0|The title says it all. The film is about diametrical juxtapositions: affluence and squalor, ethical duty and utilitarian abnegation of morality (e.g., Jamal's conscience vs. the callousness of the slave traders), true love and corporeal lust (e.g., the harem of Javed vs. profound sentiments between Jamal and Latika). Slumdog Millionaire's success lies in its insistence on extremes to offer a quasi-Dickensian social critique. Though this viewpoint certainly represents nothing novel, the film is strikingly original in its multilayered approach. It is at once a credible romance, tracing the development of Jamal's and Latika's relationship to serendipitous fruition from their life as street kid \\"musketeers\\" through Latika's unhappy position as the sex toy of a polygamous, abusive husband; a documentary that affords a seemingly panoramic view of Indian culture, including a coldy realistic portrayal of the law enforcement officials and the horrors of the child beggar slave trade; and a philosophical commentary on justice and free will. This latter point is of particular importance to the film's message and is particularly illustrated in the sequence involving the show's two final questions that he does not know the answer to.<br /><br />First, in the move that gets him arrested, Jamal picks an answer different from the one that the quiz show host writes on the mirror in the bathroom. What is interesting here is why he does this. Perhaps he is reacting against the host's obvious contempt for him as one nouveau riche Indian to another by deliberately picking a different answer. More plausibly, however, it is because of Jamal's resistance to choose any answer that he didn't pick of his own accord. In this way, the film equates the apparent randomness of answering a multiple-choice question correctly when one doesn't know the answer with the often apparent randomness of making good ethical choices. Jamal's slumdog background would indicate to the authorities that he should have been taught no moral principles and thus would choose the sleazy way out by cheating, yet he seems to have an innate sense of right and wrong. Jamal's choices may seem more random since they are untutored by a principled upbringing, yet the attempt is to show -- if we grant Boyle the, again, quasi-Dickensian supposition that any individual at birth has a greater propensity toward good than evil -- that the poor and disadvantaged person may, in fact, be more likely to choose right because he is less tainted by the learned behaviors of acquisitiveness.<br /><br />Second, in a twist of dramatic irony, Jamal is asked what the name of the third musketeer is and is unable to answer even though he, Latika, and his brother Salim used to call themselves the \\"Three Musketeers.\\" In a scene of tremendous energy and tension, Latika, who has been released from her bondage rather unexpectedly by Salim, had rushed to the show to meet Jamal. Because Jamal doesn't know the answer, he uses the \\"phone-a-friend\\" option to call Salim, but instead reaches Latika, whom Salim had given the cell phone and who has now arrived at the show. She doesn't know the answer either, so in the end Jamal ends up randomly picking the first available answer, A, Aramis, the right answer. This wonderful sequence ties in the themes of fate and justice while reiterating the illustration of moral dilemmas from the first question. Jamal's life has been one of degradation and subjugation, as well as waiting and hoping to be with the woman he loves. It is therefore poetic justice that the answer to the final question should be the first available one.<br /><br />Some have claimed that the film is nothing original thematically. To them I ask, well what isn't? In the end, it's how one treats the themes that matters. Therein lies the originality of this film, easily one of the very best made in the past 10 years.<br /><br />Grade: Ataught no moral principles and thus would choose the sleazy way out by cheating, yet he seems to have an innate sense of right and wrong.

B0036TGSR6|3.0|If this movie were a nice, single-malt whisky I'd review it as follows:  Nose: dried orange peel, dark chocolate, wild cherry with a hint of peat.  Taste: full-bodied and almost chewy, clings to the palate.  Finish: Wait? What? No finish???    It all starts out very promising. From the very first minutes the movie draws you near. You find yourself IN the story, wondering what will happen next. Even though the pace is quite slow, it's never boring.    Then suspense is built up, and up, and up... And then when you expect a grand finale... Suddenly the credits start rolling and you're left with a hollow feeling, thinking: \\"Wait... That's it???\\"    Therefore: 3 stars. Could've been 4 or 4 1/2 with a better ending.
0307341550|5.0|Camille is a thirty year old strikingly beautiful news paper reporter in Chicago. She hasn't been all that good at reporting news so far, but her nurturing boss has high hopes regardless. When two little girls go missing in Camille's home town, Wind Gap, her boss \\"Curry\\" sends her home to Southern Missouri in order to get the scoop. Yet, Camille doesn't go easily because she's got plenty of skeletons in her closet and every one of them is waiting back in Wind Gap for her arrival.<br /><br />Fresh out of the insane asylum six months earlier for cutting words into her flesh for years, Camille's character is so well written and developed she jumps right off the page. The writer was so skilled that I felt as though I honestly understood Camille. This in my opinion is a huge feat. Considering, the fact that Camille has cut words into her flesh from ankle to wrist, drinks likes a fish, and is outrageously promiscuous. Her thoughts and needs were perfectly conveyed to the reader, I was never at a loss.<br /><br />When Camille arrives in Wind Gap she is greeted by her cold, beautiful, and meticulous mother, Adora, and the hunting memories of her dead half sister, Meriam, whom died in her preteens.<br /><br />Camille's mother Adora comes from money and married into it. Her husband Alan is a waif like shadow who has very little opinions or personality. Camille's living half sister Amma whom is only 13, is moody, and cruel, but also rules the town with her family's money and good looks. Camille knows very little of Amma seeing how she was born after Camille left home and moved to Chicago. At first Amma is a bit of an enigma to Camille, that all changes.<br /><br />For instance in the beginning of the book you can tell the writing is good, but what else, you question. You think things are just generically awkward between Camille and her family. The typical jealous and untrustworthy mother. The rebellious teen half sister. The fly on the wall step father. Yet, as the pages turn and you get to know Camille and her family better you start to see things differently. The fear and misery of who and what Camille is sneaks up on you. By the middle of the book you almost feel tainted by the sickness she has endured. The sickness they all have endured.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Camille is on the hunt for the story and the two missing girls. Who both turn up dead and with no teeth. Things become frightening and dark. Camille's search for the truth leads her down a slippery slope into discovering her worst fears. She becomes more and more unpredictable and flighty. Her choices more and more irrational. Everything starts to unravel into a macabre scene, and she isn't the only player.

B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|I got this because I read the reviews about the recycle time. After getting the pack and using it quite a few times, I must say, I LOVE the recycle time. I can click away and not really worry about the recycle time. I have probably shot at most 500 shots without changing batteries. But, I will say, if you are using rechargeable like I do, make sure they are fully charged before going out to shoot. Some not fully charged lowers your capability quite a bit.
0307454541|5.0|The elements that make up a novel are Plot, Character, Atmosphere and Writing Style.  This book is excellent in the first three but, alas, sometimes lax in the last.<br /><br />The plot is intricate and very detailed.  A magazine editor is hired to find out what happened to an adolescent girl who disappeared decades ago.  He eventually is teamed with a very strange young woman researcher.  That sums it up, but the plot is far more involved.  The theme is male violence toward women, although it is some time before that becomes clear.<br /><br />The two major characters are the \\"detectives\\" in this quest, with the more interesting one being Lisbeth Salander, one of the great figures in all literature.  She's in her mid-twenties and looks like a biker with her spiked hair, various tatoos and piercings.  Her social skills are so close to nil that she has a government appointed keeper of sorts.  But she is a tireless researcher with a photographic mind.  And these contradictions are what make her come alive for the reader.  Too many fictional characters can be described in a word or two, but not Lisbeth.<br /><br />The atmosphere is excellent.  The primary setting is a small Swedish island with a bridge to the mainland.  Most of the residents are members of a large, wealthy, dysfunctional family that owns a multi-layered business enterprise.  The author takes the reader there and to the other locations that figure in the story.  The key to atmosphere in a novel is the feeling the reader has that he knows the place, can feel it, smell it, etc.<br /><br />With all this going for the novel, it is marred by the writing style, more specifically by the abundance of cliches.  Other reviewers have catalogued some of these, and I won't repeat them.  I'm assuming that cliches in Swedish are different from those in English, so the blame should probably rest upon the translator and ultimately the editor.  The cliches don't ruin the novel, but they may make a reader wince now and then.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent piece of work--not for those who want their novels on rails with characters that can be described in a word.  It's more akin to The Tin Drum, Shogun and Crime and Punishment than to pop bestsellers.ellent piece of work--not for those who want their novels on rails with characters that can be described in a word.

0553381687|1.0|Characterisation: extremely weak. Even if done well, how would I empathize with a bunch of spoilt elitist royals? The writing seems to assume we commoners reading are breathless at their every squabble, that we care what whatever her name's favourite color is, etc.<br /><br />Bad guys: 100% bad, no redeeming features or complexity.<br /><br />Good guys: 100% good, very little in the way of flaws, aside perhaps a Regal Short Temper here or there. Even the fricken Direwolfs are 100% entirely noble. The Lannisters are EVIL and every scene they practically don a NEON SIGN which says \\"DISLIKE THESE CHARACTERS\\". Except for the dwarf who has an \\"EXCEPT THIS ONE\\" tee shirt on.<br /><br />Dialogue: poor, subtle as a brick. And he WAY overdoes certain things, eg if a character has been 3 or 4 times demonstrated as sad about something, Martin will, despite demonstrating it, POINT IT OUT ANYWAY for the really really slow kids in the class, as in: \\"She was very sad\\".<br /><br />Description: competent with at least one lapse every chapter, be it overdoing similes or picking inappropriate ones that have no bearing. I really tried to cut him slack for a while but as the book progressed the writing got worse. His editor needs more coffee.<br /><br />Plot: I am amazed how BORING this book was! This guy blathers on and on, it was amazing! In the introduction / prologue or whatever, something happened! There were these spooky thingos, a sword fight. Cool! And then? 200 pages later, NOTHING. A kid gets dropped from a window. That's all that happens. Everything else is blather.<br /><br />I love a good fantasy story, but good luck finding one that's well written. I have been wondering, baffled, why so many fantasy books are simply GARBAGE. I now know this is the genre where all the really really bad writers are hiding out hoping no one notices how much they stink.<br /><br />The American Tolkien, eh? I think America can do better than this.

0307269752|1.0|***POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />I should know better than to read \\"best sellers\\". Did I really force myself to read all 465 pages of this?<br /><br />I had heard that the beginning was slow - that's an understatement. The first 150 pages were so boring and completely unnecessary but I plodded on because it's supposed to get better, right?<br /><br />WRONG<br /><br />There were way too many unnecessary details about things that don't matter and about things that were already unnecessarily described two chapters ago! Trying to keep all the characters straight(who all seemed to have similar names that start with \\"B\\") was impossible so I gave up. And it didn't help that the author kept switching between calling characters by their first names and then their last names<br /><br />This books was way over the top with very graphic, descriptive torture and rape scenes. I had to put it down a few times because I couldn't handle anymore. The attack on Salander was completely irrelevant and is was never mentioned again and you don't see her having any effects from it at all. And seriously, a torture chamber? Come on! That was just so off the wall! But on the other hand, you could read chapters and chapters of dull descriptions where nothing at all happens.<br /><br />I was definitely annoyed with the resolution of Harriet's disappearance. It seemed that Larsson concocted so many possibilities throughout that book that at the end, he scrapped them all and took the easy way out.<br /><br />Oh and wait, after the Harriet storyline was resolved there's still 100 pages of the Wennerstrom storyline. Does anybody really care about that anymore??? Hmmmm, would I rather read about a murder or some financial gangster that you never see just hear about through cryptic, dull musings of Blomkvist and Salander.<br /><br />I'm very happy to return this book to the library and feel sorry for whoever picks it up to read after me.
0790731940|5.0|There are probably lots of 'older' releases that you haven't gotten around to seeing---if this version of &#34;Maverick&#34; is one of them, then remedy that---pronto, pardner. Not a 'serious' Western, it's nonetheless one of the most entertaining offerings you'll ever see. The director is in full control here, and he does a whiz-bang job. The storyline, action and comedy flow along as smooth as buttermilk, and the cast: it couldn't be better. It was a gamble (pun intended) for any actor to try to step into the boots of James Garner, the original television Bret Maverick (here, very amusingly cast as a lawman-of-sorts)---but Mel Gibson pulls it off handsomely. Mel captures the character's offbeat charm perfectly, and even when he's being less than above-board, we can't help but root for his Maverick, because----as Jodie Foster's &#34;Mrs. Bransford&#34; puts it: &#34;There he goes, bein' all likable again.&#34;  Foster herself is an absolute delight, in an atypical role as a faux-Southern belle with a slightly tarnished clapper. She oozes &#34;oomph&#34; here, and has a smoldering chemistry with Gibson. It's a mystery as to why a sequel didn't appear...possibly because the screenplay by William Goldman is so hard to top. The whole cast follows the light mood, all the way, and you'll find yourself laughing even after repeated viewings. This is a keeper---buy it !!!

1423113381|1.0|I was so excited when I heard that Riordan was coming out with a book on the Ancient Egyptian Gods, I couldn't wait to start it.  I'm sorry to say, that for me, this is a major let down.  Before I go on, I want to say that I LOVE the Percy Jackson series, and I've read them many times over. They are such a fun adventure.<br /><br />The plot could have been so interesting. Carter and Sadie are brother and sister that have grown up apart.  Carter traveled the world with his father, and Sadie stayed with her grandparents after their mother was killed.  One night, the father, Carter and Sadie are in a museum, and their father does some accient magic to call on of the Egyptian God. As it turns out, their father has vanished, and the museum is in ruins.  Carter and Sadie's father unleased 5 gods, not just one. Soon Carter and Sadie are on the run, and they start to learn truth on who they are, who their bloodline is, and what really happened to their mother.<br /><br />As I said, it sounded so interesting. This book has a few problems. The fist one is Riordan's writing style for this series. It's awful.  He wrote it as if we're hearing what has happened on tapes and not in a printed book.  Characters talk to each other on the \\"tape\\" and it's hard to read.  It's very distracting.  I also didn't like how Riordan writes in the first person for each chapter. Each chapter either Carter or Sadie is telling the story from their point of view.  It was hard to tell them apart. The sounded the same. During the chapters, I had a hard time telling who was telling the story.  For me, it has the overall feeling of  James Patterson novel.<br /><br />Speaking of writing style, the characters would retell what happened to them during the book.  In chapter 11, one charters retells what happened to them. I didn't see a need for this. We know what happened to them because we read it. For me, it felt like a waste of time.<br /><br />The Characters: To be honest, I found Carter and Sadie to be interchangeable. Neither of them had their own character traits.  Both of them were flat and hard to get to know and like.  I didn't see either of them having and charm or depth to them.I also didn't like how when they did something, and the other asked, \\"How did you do that?\\" Then the other character would reply, \\"I don't know.\\"  That's kind of a cop out when it comes to characters.<br /><br />I just wish that Rirodan just wrote The Red Pyramid like a regular novel, and not change the point of views from one character to another.<br /><br />As I said, I wanted to like it because I really like the Percy Jackson series, but Riordan changed his writing style, and it spoiled the book for me.em had their own character traits.

B000BKACO8|5.0|This book has a number of characters with the main characters including the Finch family.  Atticus Finch is the father and he is an attorney in the small southern town of Maycomb, Alabama.  Atticus has two children; a son named Jeremy age 10 who is nicknamed Jem and a daughter age six named Jean Louise who is called Scout.  Jem and Scout's mother died when Scout was only two years old.  They have a housekeeper and cook named Calpurnia.  The story is narrated by Scout.  It tells of their life in Maycomb and about the summer they meet a boy next door staying with his aunt.  This boy is 7 years old and is named Dill.  The children quickly become friends and spend most of their time together playing.  There is an obsession with the children of a nearby neighbor named Boo Radley.  Legend said that Boo had done bad things as a child and had stabbed his father in the leg with a pair of scissors at one point.  Many people have never seen Boo, including Jem, Scout and Dill. They spent time thinking about how they can get Boo to come out of his house.    A big portion of the book tells about a trial that is going on in town of a very kind  African American man named Tom Robinson who is charged with beating and raping Mayella Ewell.  Atticus is appointed Tom's attorney.  Mayella Ewell comes from a very poor uneducated white family in town. This book takes place in the 1940's when there was much racial tension in the south.   Many people in town felt that Tom Robinson was guilty before he was even tried for the crime.      I enjoyed this story very much.  It was interesting that it was narrated by a child.  Jem and Scout were obviously very close to their father.  They greatly admired him and respected him as did most people in the small community of Maycomb.  This story keeps your interest with the trial and also things that happen to the Finch children.  I highly recommend this book as it is easy to read and understand.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|We have a Baby Jogger City Mini double - love the stroller, hate that it doesn't come with even a cup holder - and I really didn't like the idea of spending a minimum of $30 for the one that they sell for it. It didn't get good reviews for use on the double stroller, but in one of the reviews this one was mentioned.<br /><br />It fits really well on my stroller, doesn't get in the way when I want to fold it up which I do after every use, holds up great and hasn't bent or anyting.  The velcro seems to be very secure, and doesn't pull tight so I don't expect any problems there.  I love that it has some structure to hold it's shape.  The zipper pocket is great for my cell phone - I stand it up in there, and when I'm done I usually leave change in it so I just zip it up so it doesn't get lost.<br /><br />The cup holders have been used for sippy cups, water bottles, travel mugs - all work well - the only thing that didn't was a 16oz paper coffee cup from the coffee shop - it wasn't easy to get in and out and the lid popped off on me...so I just use my travel mug - or get the 20 oz, haha.<br /><br />I just today ordered a second one to put on the other side of my stroller - since I have to use a double stroller I have the space, and often am walking with someone, so now I'll have space for grown up stuff, and kid stuff - they always have snacks and drinks too.<br /><br />A great product and an awesome price!
1400032717|5.0|This story takes place in Swindon, England.  The main character is named Christopher Boone who is 15 years old.  Christopher is highly intelligent but has a form of autism called Asperger's Syndrome.  Christopher lives with his father, Ed.  Christopher's parents are divorced, however, Ed tells Christopher that his mother died two years ago of a heart attack.  Actually what happened is that Christopher's mother, Judy, has run away with their neighbor, Roger Shears.  Judy and Roger had an affair and decided to move away together as Judy is having trouble raising Christopher with his autism..  One night Christopher found a dead poodle in the neighbor's yard that had been killed with a pitch fork. The dog's name was Wellington and belonged to their neighbor, Mrs. Shears. Mrs. Shears comes outside to see Christopher holding the dog and assumes that he has killed the dog.  She calls the police and when the policeman tries to touch Christopher, he hits the policeman.  He is taken down to the police station to be questioned more thoroughly.  Christopher's father comes down and takes him home after they realize that it was a misunderstanding and Christopher is innocent.     Christopher decides to write a murder mystery regarding the death of the dog for a school assignment.  He enjoys reading murder mystery novels and one of his favorites is Sherlock Holmes.  In the process of writing this novel, he finds how about his mother being alive and living in London.  Christopher travels to London by himself by train which is very difficult for him.  He finds his mother and reunites with her and decides that he wants to live with his mother.    I found this book rather interesting.  It showed how a person with autism thinks about things and how they don't understand things such as humor, facial expressions, etc.  This book tends to ramble off on different math and science related subjects which is suppose to show how a child with autism thinks.  I found this book very interesting and would recommend it to others.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Downey is the perfect choice for this new remake of a classic. who knew Guy Ritchie had it in him for a classic movie? (director) Jude Law is a bit pretty for Watson, but a nice spin on the character. wish there were a bit more behind the scenes though. I loved the movie. perfect blend of mystery and action. Not to mention the \\"bods\\". But I'm a female ;-) Enjoyable for anyone, but it is violent. So not too young an audience!
B00028HBKC|3.0|While supposedly correct according to the Bible, it was very hard to watch. I put off watching this movie for a long time and I thought perhaps giving in and watching it now would bring me closer to Jesus. It really didn't, it mostly upset me and I found that I had to stop watching. And for authenticity they used the Aramaic language but I would rather have had them use English with Aramaic subtitles. It truly made the point....they went beyond cruel and unjust treatment of Christ and seemed to have enjoyed it;I didn't.
0060723513|5.0|There has been much vilification of this book, or rather its author, since it turned out that it may not have been an authentic tale and many of the details about Australian aborigines are incorrect.<br /><br />However, even if you regard this book as fiction, the book is valuable for its essence, its message.<br /><br />The book describes a protracted \\"walkabout\\" taken by the female protagonist, against her will, together with a small group of aborigines, the \\"real people\\", through the torrid bush.<br /><br />Some of the things the \\"mutant\\" protagonist observed/learnt were as follows:<br /><br />1) Everything happens for a reason.<br /><br />2) The world is a place of abundance. If we are without fear, but trustful, everything that we need will turn up (as Jesus himself said in other words).<br /><br />3) Everyone has multiple talents.<br /><br />4) Everyone should be accepted as valuable despite appearance, age, or anything else.<br /><br />5) If so, each person will have worth in the view of society, and will thus have a feeling of self-worth.<br /><br />6) Healing can be effected without touch but by sending thoughts of perfection to the body, if the patient is open to receiving wellness.<br /><br />7)There should be no waste, everything being recycled back to nature.<br /><br />8) We are all one: if you hurt someone, you hurt yourself, and if you help someone, you help yourself.<br /><br />Besides this, the message the protagonist was to take back to her people, the other \\"mutants\\", was to respect the environment and find a solution to environmental problems before it was too late.<br /><br />Regardless of whether this \\"walkabout\\" actually took place or not, the intrinsic truths expounded by the tribe are veracious, and thus the book is important.<br /><br />The final message of the book is absolutely relevant right now (this review being written in the week of the Copenhagen climate summit, 2009). Though Marlo Morgan wrote the book at the beginning of the nineties, no adequate steps have as yet been taken to solve our pressing environmental problems.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book.mend this book.

I don't think the author knows what she's doing, and she must be a very angry and bitter person or something... because the cards actually ATTACK you personally.  And some of them are just plain useless or meaningless, IMO.  Get it if you're just a collector or want some good \\"ass-chewing.\\"  Other than that, keep your money... there are plenty of 'useful' Oracle decks out there.

B000007492|5.0|I have actually owned this album for about 15 years-- first in it's form as a volume in the purple-jacketed A&M Classics series (remember those?)  That version of it was close to perfect, but had some flaws.  Like omitting \\"School\\" and using radio edits which aren't even played on the radio anymore.  Even terrestrial stations play the full length versions these days!  A bit later, I was highly pleased with the release of this version, which has the exact same track listing and sequence, but includes \\"School\\" as the opener and features only the full-length tracks.  Needless to say, I quickly traded up.  Very recently, I accidentally damaged the disk.  I love this album so much, I immediately ordered another copy.<br />This is the perfect Supertramp comp for the casual fan, like myself, who wants the familiar tracks he grew up hearing on the radio-- no single edits, no blaring omissions.  This fills that need flawlessly, and then some.  Die hard fans may disagree, but like I often say, greatest hits compilations are not for them.  Along with the package are some great album tracks, like the prog-influenced \\"Rudy\\" and the Steely Dan-like \\"Cannonball\\", which quickly became \\"new\\" favorites of mine.  In short, this is a fun collection of songs with plenty of variety (so it's never boring) and not a weak track on it.  Unless you just can't stand Supertramp specifically, no classic rock fan should be without this album in his/her collection.

The influences are a lot more obvious on this album, you can hear the elvis, the james brown etc. The playing is very tight and it's not overproduced. More of a musician's album...

B0036XN2L2|4.0|Time goes by doesn't it? It's hard to believe that the German band Scorpions released their first album back in 1972 and that just this past March 2010 they released what is said to be their final album. Believe me when I say they still sound amazing even today, Klaus Meine's vocals are top notch and the guitar on Sting In The Tail are excellent and the band preserves that element that makes them so good, that makes them Scorpions. There is no real musical departure here; the album sounds like classic Scorpions and there won't be many surprises to fans except perhaps how good the band sounds on their final album. Sting In The Tail brings back the classic 80's sound of the band but with an updated sound because it was made recently. They want to end their career on a high not and it seems that are definitely doing so with SITT.<br /><br />Just to go through a few of the songs on the album; I feel that opening song \\"Raised On Rock\\" is probably the best song off Sting In The Tail, a great rocker in the vein of classic 80's Scorpions, great riff(reminiscent of something from 1979's \\"Lovedrive\\") ,catchy chorus and terrific energy here. The title-track is a solid rocker everything great about the band is in it. I feel that \\"The Good Die Young\\" is one of the superior songs on SITT. \\"Turn You On\\" is another excellent song that I think will become one of the favorite songs here by fans. I like the ballads as well \\"Lorelei\\" and \\"Sly\\" are strong ballads in the flavor of \\"Still Loving You\\"(and most of the 80's ballad)fans will know what to expect with the ballads on this final Scorpions album. The album ends with \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" a good ballad that has an ironic title because this is the final album, has some cheesy parts but besides that a great way to end the album.<br /><br />Sting In The Tail ends up being a solid and consistent collection of songs, a very good album true to the band's classic sound but also with a touch of modern music. Once again a great mix of rockers and ballads. This album is said to be the final in the band's career, you can never know for sure because bands retire and then come back later but I think Scorpions will really retire after the tour supporting this album is completed. I hope the band plays a few songs from Sting In The Tail during the tour they will mix well with the classics! I wouldn't say it's a five star, more a great 4 to me.ds.

B0021L8V1Q|2.0|I caught this film early and since the first movie did so well, I had some reasonable expectations going into this one. While I don't think the movie quite met what I was expecting, it wasn't all that bad.     The Good: The effects, obviously were pretty good. Pretty much what you would be expecting from a mainstream superhero movie. Nothing really spectacular or memorable in terms of special effects that blew me away, but the effects did their job of immersing you in the story, and that's all they really should be doing.    The casting was also... decent. Don Chiedle was a good addition I thought and Samuel L Jackson wasn't as unbearable as I imagined he would be when I saw him as Nick Fury at the end of the first movie. ((I have something against Sam Jackson, if he doesn't bother you, he probably won't in this film either.)) Also, whoever the guy is that plays they head of Stark's rival technology company provides some pretty decent laughs throughout.    The Bad: The casting. Let's start off with what I felt was the biggest problem. Robert Downey Jr., or maybe it was just the character of Tony Stark, came off as entirely unlikeable. I found myself liking Mickey Rourke's character more. There just seemed to be no reason to empathize with Stark. He's uber rich, probably the most powerful man in America, and his only real problem is some medical condition that he ends up curing later on in the film as if it's nothing. -SPOILER- No... seriously, he literally creates a NEW ELEMENT in about 5 minutes, and this new element cures him. Awesome. Also, there's a scene where he's drunk in the Iron Man suit, firing off it's weapons to show off for a bunch of drunk chicks. Whatever... Kinda funny, but mostly just irritating. -SPOILER END-    Another bad casting issue was Mickey Rourke. Not that he did a particularly bad job, just that it sorta felt like there was no reason for him to be there. I admit that I don't know a whole lot about Iron Man villians, and have NEVER heard of Whiplash before, so maybe he actually looks a lot like the character? I dunno, either way the performance felt inconsistant and campy.    Also, I have no problem with Jon Favreau being in a movie he directed, but this felt a little overboard. I mean, sure he was in the first Iron Man movie too, but in this one, he seems to be around too much and is even in one of the fight scenes.     There is also an actress who plays an assistant to Sam Jackson's Nick Fury, though I don't recall the actress, and her performance was nothing memorable. Your typical \\"badass chick in leather catsuit\\" flipping around rediculously in fight scenes and showing no emotion in non-fight scenes. Meh, I'm sure that's how the character was written so I can't say if it's her fault.    Editing: There seemed to be a lot of unnecessary scenes in the movie that added nothing to the overall narrative. I don't wanna list them all out for spoiler reasons. This made the movie much longer than I felt it needed to be and much of that extra time was spent either showing how \\"quirky\\" of a billionaire Tony Stark is, which I felt we saw enough of in the first movie.     Action Sequences: This is why you see a superhero movie right? Well evidently not in this one. I won't say too much about them, but they were, in my opinion, completely forgettable, unusually short (all of them combined probably take up 15 minutes of the movie), and just uninspired.     To summarize, I had hopes that this would be the movie to see this summer, but as it currently stands, I happen to think Kick-Ass, was an infintely better superhero movie, despite it's flaws and moral issues.
0920668364|1.0|I can't quite explain why I really, really don't like this book but I was NOT impressed.
B0038VPB5W|3.0|I'd have to say this is a pretty weak album by BFMV standards. A lot of other reviewers have pointed out the flaws so i wont go too deep. Seems instrumentally/intensity level/lyrically a step down from all previous efforts. Overall pretty disappointed. After my initial listen I was shocked and would have rated probably 2 stars, but after a few more listens I decided to bump it up to 3... and that's where it will stay. You wont miss anything if you skip this album. I'll be waiting for their next release and hopefully they find their cojones along the way.
B00003CXGG|5.0|great movie it was fast service,great condition.thank you so  much .looking foward to my next ordering round .thank you so much;;;;;;;;;;;;
0307454541|4.0|Like many others, I had heard about this book and found it at a reasonable price so I picked it up. As far as mysteries go, I found it to be a solid read. Parts of the plot were predictable but there were far more genuine surprises than I was expecting. The protagonists are very well developed, and the titular character is such a fun mix of crazy, sharp and deadly that you can't help but root for her. The other lead, Mikael Blomkvist, is equally engaging. Think of Rick Castle from the ABC series, an author with a quick wit and great sense of humor and you'll have a good sense for what he's all about. The author's overall goal seems to be to use this crime drama as a vehicle to offer a biting social commentary on misogyny.<br /><br />From the other reviews I've seen and the other people I've talked about the book too, you'll like the book if you don't mind the exposition and history that Larsson provides. Things don't really get moving until around pg. 300. Critics found this tedious and dull, I thought it enriched the world that Larsson had created.<br /><br />The other point to consider is that this book delves into very dark territory and there are some horrific descriptions of sexual abuse which I found rather disturbing. If you don't want to have to deal with it, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Finally, the translations did lead to some awkward turns of phrase and sentence construction that could be distracting at times. If you're a member of the grammar police, this might annoy you but I didn't find it to detract too much from the story.

0385532458|4.0|I've always loved Grisham's work, but I was leary of his book of short stories.  One of the things I love most about his books is the depth of his characters, his attention to detail and his ability to paint a picture of the story in a way that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of it.  I didn't think he'd be able to pull any of that off in so few words.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Each story brought out a different emotion - Fetching Raymond was hilarious, Funny Boy broke my heart.  Another Grisham gem that you won't want to miss.
B000002UTI|4.0|The item was better than expected, considering the use and age of the product.  Enjoy listening to it.
0312427999|5.0|In understanding the events of the last 30 years, this book outlines much of the self-centered, and community-destroying economic activity of the Friedmanite apostles that so many of us have experienced.    One only has to look at the list of requirements from the IMF in the current \\"austerity package\\" being forced on Greece in it's current crisis to see the ideology still in force today. A must-read for anyone who wishes to get a good perspective on current economic/political events.
1598561634|5.0|Granted the content is great. But I am also satisfied with the make. This will be one of my favorite books for many years to come.
B003405MF6|1.0|I think that Jeff Beck is one of the best electric guitar players on earth.  This album just does not do him justice - most of it sounds like the MUSAK piped into elevators.  He deserves a much better showing.  I hope the inspiration behind this album was just to make money, it certainly does not do justice to his incredible talent.
030745455X|5.0|This book was very good.  Couldn't put it down.  Can't wait for #3.<br />The characters are exceptional.  Very different.
B001HN694K|1.0|The movie was beautiful but the story sucked. Grown up Alice a was completely different person from child Alice. I read both Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass. This movie was highly disappointing. I thought that it would follow the book since the original Disney movie varied from the book so much. I prefer completely retelling a story than twisting a story around. I like the Alice by SyFy channel far better because it did not mislead you into thinking that it was in anyway related to the book.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|A well written book by a masterful story teller. A must read if you are a Craig Ferguson fan and a should read if you are not. As a frequent Late Late show viewer, I didn't appreciate his &#34;It's a great day in America&#34; until I read his book and partcularly his introduction.  Thanks for taking the time to tell us your story. Maybe it will help some of us appreciate ours.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|It is rare that you have the opportunity to listen to such talented guitarists, playing and exhibiting their collective music. I am very happy with my purchase.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I expected so much more from this terrific cast, but I was sadly disappointed. The film is severely marred by unnecessary explicitness. For those of us who prefer not to watch porn, we don't appreciate the filmmaker's attempt to insert it here under the guise of a sight gag. It's still offensive. Also disappointing was the storyline with a stepfather and young son constantly talking very explicitly about sex. Beyond inappropriate and utterly depressing. Don't waste your time like I did on a flawed film whose pretty package disguises the ugliness beneath.
1572814136|5.0|As a professional reader  for  many  years,  I  have  enjoyed  the  Rider-Waite  cards  for  their  in-depth  simplicity  which  make  them  perfect  to  give  a  good  reading  to  the  many  varied  folk  who  are  having  a  reading ... These  Radiant  certainly  give  a  lovely  'lift'  with  their  crisper  more  vibrant  colours  and  have  lost  nothing  from  the  originals ... Can  honestly  say,  that  these  look  very  professional,  and  certainly  give  a  more  professional  look ...  Highly  recommend  to  professionals  and  more  importantly,  to  those  who  are  interested  in  the  Art  of  Reading  the  Tarot ...
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Tropic Thunder is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time. I love how this movie is so politically incorrect, and makes fun of Hollywood, and everyone in general. Ben stiller is great in the role of an action hero whose character is on the wane, and Robert Downey Jr's role as an Australian actor who makes himself black for the role, is so politically incorrect that you cannot stop laughing whenever he is on screen. Also, let's now forget Tom Cruise's cameo as the obnoxious film producer is just amazing. I watched this movie twice in the theater, and bought this DVD as soon as it came out. This version is a bit longer compared to the theatrical version, but it is definitely worth it. This movie is definitely a must buy for movie lovers.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Being a Sandra Bullock fan, I was already expecting a really good performance. And seeing her win the Academy Award for best actress, I knew she did a good job in the movie. But still, I was blown away by Sandra's performance in The Blind Side. She was absolutely awesome in this role; totally believable, and very deserving of the awards she received for her portrayal. Outstanding script, great support cast--just a totally great viewing experience. This is a movie I will watch over and over again--mainly due to Sandra Bullock's performance.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Okay. It's not the 4 hour or 6 hour version of Dune that all fans are waiting for, but a leap from the HD-DVD version. Until now, Dune was only available on HD-DVD in high-definition and the blu-ray re-release shows improvements in picture and sound quality.     The image is recompressed from it's HD-DVD predecessor which results in a sharper picture. Distortions as a result of low compression bitrates in some dark scenes aren't present in the blu-ray version and every detail from the theatrical print are present.     The sound is in DTS-HD - a great improvement from the Dolby Digital Plus soundtrack on the HD-DVD    The blu-ray has all the same special features as the HD-DVD, but the blu-ray adds BD-Live for extra on-line content.    This is the best release of the theatrical version on Dune.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|WONDERFUL on blu ray!! anyone who likes this movie needs it on blu ray. shipping from the seller was prompt and speedy! great transaction
B0039SFKSW|5.0|This release in my opinion is closer to the debut album then they've ever gotten.  A couple of slower tracks but songs like Holy War, I Believe, Finger on the Trigger (rehash from Icon but a better heavier version) are all great and decent rockers.  The song that stands out to me is End of the World.  Just a great mid tempo song that is cleverly arranged song.    In comparsion to their prior release it's more edgy and heavier then Phoenix.  I think Palmer and Howe are more prominent here than on Phoenix as well.  Sadly this will not get the attention Phoenix did becuase it's their second release since reforming and Frontiers isn't doing much to promote it.  They play 4 or 5 songs on the current tour from Omega.    But again, their strongest album since the debut.
0307454541|4.0|This book is like a four movement symphony, where the third movement comes to such a smash crashing conclusion that we think that is the end and start to clap. And then the next movement starts with a reprise of themes occuring early in the first movement, adding in new themes, coming to a second conclusion, then continuing on though an uninspiring third conclusion finally ending on a sad note which leaves us rather unsatisfied and wishing it had ended another way.<br /><br />Not a fast read, a lot of detail - some boring, most of it interesting and educational, but generally a good read, in the style (in my opinion) of Martin Cruze Smith. The middle aged divorced journalist meets the childhood-abused, tattooed and pierced, twenty-something girl, who happens to be a world class hacker and have a photographic memory. High finance, money laundering, serial killers, journalist hide saved in more ways than one by hacker, who also swings a mean golf club. A couple of threads still not tied up at time of final blue note ending - glad there are two sequels.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Disney's movie showcasing their first Black princess is a marvelous feat. Anika Noni Rose is superb as the voice of Jasmine and Keith David is the perfect choice for the villain. And of course the graphics and animation are first rate. Every parent should purchase this movie and share with their children (over and over again). Certain to become a classic just like other classic Disney movies.
B0001FYPZU|1.0|I do not give this product a posative review due to the fact that it would not play on any of my players at home. It is a Region 2 product which is not playable in most American players. I tried to contact the company and I was unable to contact them. I also filed a complaint with Amazon. I feel like I wasted my money.
B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Kung fu'd my a$$ and made me write this review. Loved this movie, no flaws except it could have been a little more violent in my opinion. I think there were one or two guys he didn't empty his clip into but merely dispatched with a few well placed shots. Not good enough. I want smoking bullet holes in every orifice. good night folks.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|As I said, I just got this book, and yes, it is also very good.Unfortunately, I haven't had much time to read it because I've had to go to track practice and study for tests. Anyway's it's a good book and I would recomend it to any one. Written by Aaron
1401923119|5.0|I loved this book! The language flowed and not once did I need to re-read a sentence or paragraph in order to understand what it said. Overall, I am now more convinced than ever before that our beliefs govern our outcomes, and our everyday lives. They govern ever cell in our body. The environment we live in has a tremendous impact on how our cells react. It is important that we understand the mechanics that make our lives pleasant or unpleasant. It is important that we nurture ourselves for our own ultimate happiness. Recommended reading!
B0036TGSVM|3.0|This isn't a review. I'm going to be highly original and have a rant about a product that hasn't been released yet. Because Amazon let me.    Actually I won't lower myself to that. I'm hungry.
B0037W68F4|5.0|MGMT basically came out of FAR left field when they released O.S. A few plays of \\"Time To Pretend\\", \\"Kids\\", and \\"Electric Feel\\" later, they were on top of the world, but that wasn't their intentions. The remaining 7 songs on the album were ignored (which is a shame because the 2nd half of the album is pure neo-prog, 80's dance, drugged out, psychedelic bliss) so what did they do? The created a an album with no worthwhile singles, no catchy tunes, no \\"Kids\\" by a long shot. And what is the result? An even better album that takes the 'sophomore slump' incrustation and shoves it a good 6 inches up societies ass.     Every song on here would fit perfectly on most Beatles and Pink Floyd albums (Especially \\"Siberian Breaks\\" which could easily set up camp on \\"Animals\\" or \\"Meddle\\"). Our trip begins with \\"It's Working\\" which appears to be about what love must feel like whilst on ecstasy. From there the album just continues in the same psychedelic, 60s-era path.     The amount of negative reviews astonishes me. I'm VERY picky about my music, but this albums exceeds in every way, shape, and form. I actually prefer it over their \\"Masterpiece\\" Oracular Spectacular (which I absolutely LOVED).       Songs like \\"I Found A Whistle\\" \\"Someones Missing\\" and the title track will give you some OS flashbacks, however, for the most part, Congratulations serves as a polar opposite to OS. Which is not a bad thing. All of these \\"die-hard\\" fans are comparing it to Oracular Spectacular, which is tried-and-true idiocy. These 2 albums are nothing a lot. Congratulations shows a much more mature side of MGMT, and is in NO WAY similar to their debut, so to compare the 2 is like comparing hot and cold.       The Best Ones:  Congratulations  Siberian Breaks  Brian Eno  Flash Delirium  Someones Missing  I Found A Whistle    The Great Ones:  A Song For Dan Treacy  It's Working    The Good Ones:  Lady Dada's Nightmare      So after all of these words you've read, the only thing left to do it listen. WhichI highly, HIGHLY recommend.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Since we inevitably have some verbose gasbag writing paragraphs giving the entire plot of the movie and their learned opinion of it.    Let's all do each other a favor and knock off giving the plot away.
B002QW7AJY|4.0|I was surprised by the movie.  Interesting plot twist. Good special effects and acting.  One of the better Sci-Fi flicks recently released.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|When Asia released their first, self-titled album in 1982, I played it until the grooves wore out.  I had already been a big fan of Steve Howe from his virtuoso work with Yes, and of Geoff Downes' from his work with the Buggles and Yes.  The flame died quickly however, as their second album, Alpha, was such a tremendous disappointment over their first, then internal battles destroyed the original lineup.  Pheonix, Asia's 2008 release, was a solid return for them, if a bit uneven in terms of song quality.  Omega is by far the best CD I have purchased in the last year.  There are many songs that sound like vintage Asia.  The track that has been featured on their website, Finger on the Trigger, which originally appeared on Icon II (Wetton and Downes' side project) is a great way to begin the album.  I actually prefer the Icon version of the song because Downes' keyboards are more prominent.  This track is followed by \\"Through My Veins\\" and \\"Holy War,\\" both of which display Asia's progressive muscle.  The songs are not overly long or self-indulgent, but they do provide the four musicians with the opportunity to play their instruments a little.  \\"The End of the World,\\" features a unique vocal sound from the band during the chorus, which demonstrates their ability to surprise you.  \\"I Believe\\" is another great mid-paced rocker that is reminiscent of the Asia of years gone by.  With all of that said, their are some unique tracks on the album, such as \\"Listen Children\\" and \\"Light the Way\\" that sound nothing like Asia, but are uplifting, and cleverly arranged.  \\"Light The Way\\" took me aback because of bouncy keyboard and guitar parts that sound like something out of a Devo song.  But the song is growing on me and it demonstrates the band's versatility.  The most surprising track for me is \\"There Was A Time\\" which is beautifully arranged.  Though it is not a quintessential Asia song, it does show the bands capacity to add new, creative textures to their music.  It is perhapsmy favorite song on the album.  Of course, to be a true Asia release, there has to be at least one sappy love song reminiscent of \\"The Smile Has Left Your Eyes,\\" probably my least favorite Asia track of all time.  Emily is the \\"bonus track\\" on the album, and the guys could have spared us altogether in my opinion.   The record concludes with a largely acoustic piece entitled, \\"I Don't Wanna Lose You Now,\\" which also rates fairly high on the sap meter, but is lyrically superior to some of the other pop trash Asia has produced over the years.  In all, Asia has produced a CD that demonstrates their musical prowess, and is lyrically stronger than many Wetton/Downes compositions, both with Asia and Icon.  For me this is the original Asia's strongest release next to their debut album.  It is varied stylistically, but still very even.  If you are an Asia fan, you will not be disappointed!
0679805273|5.0|Came quickly, perfect condition. Always loved this book when I was little, got it for my daughter's 1st birthday.

0307266303|5.0|I'll be honest, I haven't finished the book yet--probably only 50 pages to go. I've had it for almost a month, but have a hard time getting through it. Not because it's dull, dry, hard to understand, it's actually the opposite. When I read it I get motivated to throw on my Five Fingers and run as far as I can. I usually read when I want to relax at the end of a long day. With this book, I've twice stopped reading, got out of bed, thrown on my shoes and ran. I've stopped reading it at night ;)      I've really noticed a change in my running since reading this book. I'm not gasping for air, I'm not in pain. I'm more energized.     And, the best part, it's a story. An amazing story that talks about technique, but it's not a technical book trying to tell you what you need to do. It paints a picture of where your mind should be.    This is a book that I have been recommending to all of my running friends, but will never loan them my copy.

0385737947|5.0|The Maze Runner by James Dashner.  **NO SPOILERS**    To be perfectly honest, this is a really great book! It keeps you on the edge of your seat through out almost the whole book. It was a little bit slow in the beginning, but once you get into it, you just want to read more and more! It took my about a day or so to finish it because I have school so I don't have a lot of time to read, but trust me...it is so worth it to get this book. The second book is called The Scorch Trials and it comes out October 12th, 2010. I am so excited for the next book! The end of this book (to me) left a major cliffhanger. I just cannot wait for the next book!

The stop action is good for anyone who might have been in a coma since  the release of \\"The Seven Voyages of Sinbad\\", but not much for anyone who can recognize a scene from Star Wars.

0312370849|5.0|I am an avid reader of anything WWII related and have read many fiction and non-fiction books relating to the Holocaust. This is unlike any I've read before, based on the accounts taken place in Paris during the war and role that the French Government played in Hitler's Genocide. Sarah's Key is a well told story of a modern day woman finding out what happend to a young Jewish girl during and after the war. Very emotional book, I could literally see young Michels face and curls and don't know if I'll ever be able to get that image out of head.

This is the restored version with all the good stuff that was on the cutting room floor where it ought not have been, thankfully it was put back and the motion picture now makes better sense and is more fun to watch than when on the silver screen itself.  This is really a \\"must have\\" DVD, you'll be licky if after you loan it out you get it back, its that good!

He has a smoky type of voice and his music is on traditional side , some rock, some folk, very smooth.  His girl back up singers are very good too. Even my husband loves this album.

Besides false advertisement I am pretty sure that is against the law seeing as how they made 13.00 profit off of me for something that they never paid for to begin with.

0439023483|2.0|I don't believe in censorship, I let my kids read omniverously, but I'm grateful I picked up this series and checked it out. We'll be having some long conversations this weekend about the culture we live in and that produces books like this.  At first I thought these books would be a critique of Reality Television, of a corrupt and decadent society where some toil ceacelessly, and others amuse themselves endlessly like late-empire Romans. I hoped as I turned the pages that Suzanne Collins might have something real and important to say about how knowing that we are constantly being filmed changes the way we behave, even when we are in mortal peril. I hoped she'd have something to say about courage and love and the meaning of life and death.  Forget about it.  Where J.K. Rowling is an alchemist, collecting dross and ore from everwhere, and turning it into gold, Collins is a petty thief, stealing hamfistedly from Battle Royale, Survivor episodes and Project Runway. This series has the feel of something concocted by an editor a writer and a marketing director. Be sure to put in a bridal gown...the girls love bridal gowns! What upsets me the most is that she herself is a manipulative Gamekeeper who can make anything awful happen at will to her characters to move along her plot and she invites her readers to be like the audience who watches the Hunger Games, turning the pages to find out who will be slaughtered next and in what exciting way. Did she have any sense of irony or humor or satire (as Battle Royale does) that asked kids to question their experience, I'd forgive her everything, but she doesn't. It's all delivered very seriously. We are allowed to mourn for the very young and the very old but as to those trained for the gladitorial combats they are brute killing machines and we are allowed to cheer their demise. When Katniss kills...it's always in self-defense and she's killing someone who clealy deserves to die...she never is tortured by her own lack of morality. How convenient...  I am reminded of the zen story: You are having a dream that you are on a lifeboat with your mother and your father. You are told that the situation is such that you can only save one of them. Which would you choose?  In the Hunger Games, the characters struggle and wrestle with this question but Suzanne Collins hersel doesn't know the answer...the answer is \\"you are having a dream.\\" Wake up!   Wake up Suzanne Collins.  In the second book she attempts to make it seem like Katniss will inspire or even lead a revolution in this corrupt dystopia...and maybe sort of she does. But it's all completley unwitting. She's a pawn even of the revolutionaries. Besides, since we don't really know anything much about the society, its governmental system, its foundation and maintenance, this is NOT 1984 (although I'm sure Collins would like to imagine for herself that it is.)  Finally, I am left thinking of Harry Potter, how J.K. Rowling wants her readers to feel the weight of each death in that book, of the good characters and the bad, the complex and the simple. Cedric Diggory is a minor character in some ways but his death is not minor. Harry will die to return his body to his parents. This is fiction that raises us up, that asks the best of us, the believes in the best in us.  Collins treats most of her characters like figures in an X-Box game, choosing one or two for us to mourn a little and then focusing on dispensing with her legions in all kinds of creative and inventive weighs.   My final take on these books? Plenty of action, the kids will gobble it up, bu they'll be as morally hungry when they are done as if they had been playing Mortal Combat. Let 'em read them, but please, parents, read them yourself and start a discussion about real revolutionaries, real courage, and real sacrifice.
B001LF347E|4.0|Much in the vein of the currently-popular franchise \\"re-boot\\" idea, Merlin: The Complete First Season continues this idea by re-inventing the traditional Arthurian legends for a newer, younger audience. In this BBC production, the typical, white-haired \\"old man\\" version of Merlin is traded in for a young boy learning about his magic and his destiny.    Merlin (Colin Morgan) is a naturally gifted warlock who is sent to live with Gaius (Richard Wilson), the physician in the court of Uther Pendragon (Anthony Head), king of Camelot. However, Uther has become a tyrant and prosecutes anyone and anything associate with magic. Uther's only small joy rests in his son, the famous Arthur (Bradley James) who, in this show, is depicted as an arrogant and reckless, yet well-meaning youth that always manages to get into trouble (and Merlin has to save him) . After saving Arthur's life, Merlin becomes his personal manservant, and thus begins Merlin's journey to realize his destiny as a powerful warlock and protector and friend to Arthur. Merlin and Arthur are joined in their journey by Morgana (Katie McGrath), the king's ward, and her maidservant Guinevere \\"Gwen\\" (Angel Coulby).    The plotlines for about the first half of the series seem to blur together. Each episode feels like a repeat of the last, following the same formula: a stranger shows up claiming to be someone they are not, Merlin uncovers the true and wants to use magic to fix it, when Merlin confronts others about the truth no one believes him, Merlin eventually saves the day with magic secretly, and Arthur typically gets the credit. The characters also felt very flat in these episodes, with little development and little relationship growth. The only thing that got me through these episodes were the high production values (the BBC doesn't skimp) and the fun, adventure aspect of the show.    Thankfully, the second half of the season really picks up. Plotlines grow more complex, characters grow deeper and the show takesa darker turn that drew me in. It becomes apparent that the first half of the season was meant to be exposition, and the writers finally got to a point where they could grow legs under their show. In particular, Morgana takes unexpected turns that pulls viewers in and makes them question everything they've learned about the world of Merlin.    The oddest thing about the American distribution of Merlin is the fact that it aired on NBC on Sunday nights. Sure, it was picked up during the summer, likely to be a filler show during the off months, but I thought it an odd choice and an odd time slot, but figured that NBC was hoping that Merlin could pull some of the Doctor Who fans and possible enjoy cult status -plus it's family-friendly. Unfortunately, NBC didn't pick up season two, but SyFy did, and is currently airing it. A third season is currently in the works from the BBC.    Bonus features in this five-disc set include episode commentary, two in-depth making of featurettes, video diaries from some of the cast while filming the series, photo galleries and wallpapers. While I found that this was a worthwhile collection of extras, I was hoping for something a little more -like deleted scenes from certain episodes, or an exploration of the original Aruthurian legends and how they are different/similar to the series.    Merlin is offered in complete surround-sound stereo, which really comes in handy during the action sequences. Surprisingly though, only English subtitles and English language audio track is available, which will probably disappoint fans with alternative language preferences.    While the show does have some shortfalls, it's a fun adventure that'll keep audiences of all ages entertained. The second half of the season proves that Merlin is filled with potential to grow into a powerful show filled with magic, depth and amazingly complex character.
B000002I6T|5.0|Jerry Garcia, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young & Grace Slick all play a part on this album.  Do I need to say more?  David really was at a creative peak during the writing/recording of this album.  Everything fell into place and he made the finest album of his solo career.  There are some beautiful songs here - \\"Music Is Love\\" is a heavenly song co written and sung with Neil Young.  It really sets the tempo before you get kicked in the groove with \\"Cowboy Movie\\" - an awesome, hippy fried - country steak of a rocker!  One of Crosby's finest songs!  \\"Laughing\\" and \\"Traction in the Rain\\" are 2 more stand out tracks that are dripping with marijuana resin and that laid back, Laurel Canyon sound.<br /><br />I also would like to mention that this is one of the best sounding (hi-fi) albums that I own.  However they mastered it I don't know but they sure knew what they were doing.  The highs are crystal clear - great acoustics!  You will not be disappointed in the sound quality!<br /><br />Bottom line - I highly recommend this album to anyone who's ever dug the Southern Cal sound, CSN, Joni, etc... as well as bands like the Dead and solo Garcia.  Outside of CSN and CSNY - it made me a solo Crosby fan and I've never looked back.  I only wish that he had recorded more solo albums in his day,  but I believe many personal problems with substance abuse held him back.  At least we have plenty of CSN - Y - and Crosby Nash recordings to hold us over.  Along with this album,  I highly recommend getting a few of his live albums - they never disappoint!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002VKJ Another Stoney Evening]] w/ Graham Nash (Great out of print CD)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002IZJ It's All Coming Back to Me Now...]] 1993 [Chris Robinson from the Black Crowes makes an appearance on \\"Almost Cut My Hair\\"]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002ITW 4 Way Street]]  w/ CSNY
B003E48AYC|1.0|This movie was a disgrace to childrens movies. They completly redid the movie and had none of the original aspects to it. Stick to the originals and dont waste your money. BY far Tim Burtons worst movie ever. A disgrace to stoners everywhere.     DTG!!!
B0012GMY64|5.0|I got the CD within the time frame expected and it was brand new and I have enjoyed listening to it.  I would buy from this company again!!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way<br />Lately, I've been lonesome<br />Blossom, it's been much too long a day<br />Seems my dreams have frozen<br />Melt my cares away...<br /><br />It's not my favorite James Taylor song. Really, I barely remember it. But it's the first song on the DVD and CD package of Carole King & James Taylor: Live at the Troubadour, and just hearing that mellow guitar and moonshine voice pretty much unhinged me --- my face flushed, my eyes glistened, and there I was, face-planted into my past.<br /><br />I'm not the only one of a certain age who will watch this intimate concert --- or see King and Taylor on their tour --- and have this reaction. Their music is mostly quiet, but it plays loud in memory; it's what we were listening to in that dump of a decade, the `70s. It's all those memories: Roe v. Wade. Kent State. Ms. Magazine. That endless war in Vietnam.<br /><br />And, set against that, the soothing and consoling music of two crooners. In terms of records sold, they're a rounding error for Michael Jackson. But back then, for white kids astonished to find themselves struggling to make decent lives in Nixon's America, they were huge.<br /><br />They were, as it turns out, huge for one another in the `70s. They first performed together at the Troubadour, a little LA club, in November of 1970. Look at the video, though --- King's playing piano for Taylor in what's clearly a very tentative collaboration. A year later, when they returned to the Troubadour, he had \\"Fire and Rain\\" and she had \\"Tapestry\\" and they had mutual, powerful magic. And then, in 2007, they returned to the Troubadour one more time to made a CD and DVD from six shows recorded over three nights.<br /><br />These 15 songs, spread over 75 minutes, are impeccable --- the technology of recording, video and editing has advanced so dramatically that the early videos seem raw and awkward. Not that these performances are slick and cynical. What you get to see and hear is the intimacy of this relationship.<br /><br />Carole King hearts James Taylor. It's all over her face as she harmonizes or just mouths the words to his songs. But then, she's hugely emotional as a signature. Her songs are hits in large part because she's brilliant at distilling deep feelings into simple statements --- \\"You've Got a Friend\\" is the gold standard --- and excitable as a musician. When she gets going, she's off the piano bench and playing standing up.<br /><br />The news flash on James Taylor, who has always seemed too accomplished to break a sweat, is how intense he is as a guitarist. King looks at Taylor, Taylor looks down at his guitar --- that unbalances the film until you get used to it, and then you have a fresh appreciation for him as a musician.<br /><br />It's the voices and harmonies that mattered when we first heard King and Taylor. The years have been kind to them. King's voice was always a little weathered, and that, for her, was a strength --- now, after failed marriages and whatever else life has slung at her, that roughness seems like the proof of experience. Taylor, a great singer in his 20s, is now a master; if you can hear a flaw, you've got better ears than I do.<br /><br />The pacing of the show and the positioning of the songs are where this package achieves liftoff. Listening and watching, I felt a kind of peace that had eluded me all day. If you're young, this may sound stupid beyond belief, but if you've got miles and bruises, this is music that connects you to old dreams and affirms every hope you ever had for your generation, your country and yourself. These are, in short, lullabies for adults.<br /><br />Just as I was thinking that, King and Taylor returned on stage for an encore. And, without the band, this is what they sang:<br /><br />Close your eyes;<br />you can close your eyes, it's all right.<br />I don't know no love songs,<br />and I can't sing the blues any more.<br />But I can sing this song,<br />and you can sing this song<br />when I'm gone.<br />It won't be long before another day.<br />We're gonna have a good time.<br />And no one's gonna take that time away.<br />You can stay as long as you like.<br /><br />If only.na take that time away.   You can stay as long as you like.     If only.

1589944607|5.0|This game is so much fun!  My friend come over every weekend to play! It is a role playing game where you are either a cylon or a human.  We have found that it is very hard for the human players to win so we always give the humans extra resources. (add 2 to each resource)  It took us SEVERAL hours to get through the rule book but it was so worth it.  We have a few friends who are very into BSG and we all play for hours.  I have never been into role playing games but this one is so much fun especially if you've seen the show. (if you haven't you really need to because it is really very good) It is very true to the show too. I have only a few complaints and that is that it takes a very long time to learn the rules unless you have someone to teach you how to play and the cylons have the obvious advantage.  It seems like once the cylons are revealed the game ends quickly after.  I think out of the many many times we've played the humans have won once. I think the game board is very nice and all the pieces are nice. I LOVE this game and I am SO glad I bought it!
1401323820|3.0|I bought Heat Wave with the thought that it would be like the show Castle, fast moving, somewhat exciting, overall fun.  As I got into it, I found it not bad but really hard to get into as it plodded along and I just didn't care about the characters Nikki Heat and Whatever Rook. I was bored. I did come to the conclusion that Stephen J. Cannell wrote it.  It's completely his style of writing.  Recommended only for the die-hard Castle fans.
B002VECMAE|4.0|Some consider this darkly comical fantastically realistic comedy about a top secret special unit in the 1980's U.S. Army, a brilliant satire on war and paranoia. The others dismiss it is a failure on the level of the infamous high-budget desert comedy of the Cold War era, Ishtar (1987). I personally think \\"The Men Who Stare At Goats\\" is a curious, cerebral, funny and poignant parody/spoof of and at the same time the dedication to many outstanding films, as different as Dr. Strangelove.., Star Wars epics, The Big Lebowski, and even the Silence of the Lambs. The famous and talented actors simply bring their characters from the earlier movies to The Men Who Stare at Goats. The film is notable for the funny, surreal narrative style with numerous leaps from present day to the not so distant past, when the two superpowers tried to create super powerful weapon against each other, using the supernatural and paranormal phenomena. This is the movie where Jeff Bridges in the full Dude Lebowski mode joins the Army and forms the Special Unit, First Earth Battalion that trains the soldiers to become the \\"warrior monks\\" who'd possess the supernatural power and be able to use their minds as the deadly weapon. The mandatory part of the training involves LSD experimentation and daily worship of Mother Earth as a source of supernatural abilities. This is the movie, where Obi-Wan-Konobi (Ewan McGregor) has no idea who the Jedi are, and the character played by Kevin Spacey is taken by the dark side of the force because of his supernatural stubbornness and meanness. As for George Clooney's Gus, the Master, the best in the unit in the past but lost and confused now, he can't forget the death of one goat that he caused by just staring at it during the experiments. Gus believes that if he saves one goat, just one from the cruel experiments now, the dead animal would stop staring at him in his memory with the unbearable silence of the goats.<br /><br />In short, if you like absurdist, off-beat, cerebral films -I highly recommend this. If not - don't stare at the goats.<br /><br />3.5 - 4 of 5ebral films -I highly recommend this. If not - don't stare at the goats.      3.5 - 4 of 5
B000003EUL|4.0|I hear that Richter complained about Leinsdorf, about his fast tempi, as if the pianist had no choice in matter. Some reviews on this site echo the complaint and castigate Leinsdorf. But this is complete nonsense. Those listeners, including Richter himself, must have big holes in their memories and/or not heard the recording for a long time. The fact is that LEINSDORF STARTS PROCEEDINGS WITH A VERY LEISURELY TEMPO, but as soon as he gets to his big solo entry RICHTER HIMSELF RACES OFF LIKE A LIGHTNING BOLT. So, I'm sorry to contradict this unfair apportionment of blame and would everyone now please scurry back to the recording and convince themselves that Richter had no cause for complaint whatever.<br />You might also compare this version of Brahms 2 with his later one, Maazel conducting, where the first movement runs merely 30 seconds longer . Why didn't he complain about Maazel?<br />Anyway: none of this has any bearing on the quality of the performance. Richter has always been a passionate artist, and this is precisely the note that strikes me most in this old recording. Passion, seething and surging, making you wonder what old Brahms would have thought. The 2nd movement in particular is staggering; while the clock length is nearly the same as in his Paris version, the latter sounds almost sedate by comparison. However, the Maazel recording features superior engineering, always a benefit when a big orchestra is present.<br />Since so many words have been written already in this forum, I'll leave it at that. I think the Leinsdorf factor made for an inspired recording, whereas the Maazel factor made for a superb, magisterial reading. You have to take your choice on that basis (I'll have both, thank you!).<br />I also disagree with many reviewers about the Beethoven \\"encore\\". I've heard many Richter performances and feel quite strongly that he is ill at ease with this composer. He may not have been conscious of it. But he tends, here and elsewhere, to pummel the music. Not a labour of love, nor of inspiration, but of anguish. What is this Beethoven fellow trying to say? How can I get it out of the keys and into the open? This is where Gilels is obviously at home - his Appassionata is in my opinion the most profound and the most riveting; it sounds like a new discovery under his hands. And now that this name has been mentioned, I have to say that in the heavyweight stakes of Brahms 2, he is also the more persuasive, the more convincing and ultimately the man who digs deeper. [[ASIN:B00070EBBM Brahms: Concerto No. 2]] and [[ASIN:B000001GQY Brahms: Concertos for Piano No. 1 & 2, Fantasia Op. 116]].<br />But all this quibbling does not, in the end, amount to anything of great value. If you are passionate about this music, buy the album, you'll not regret it. If you can only permit yourself a single recording, Richter remains a top recommendation; and in this case the difference between \\"passion\\" (Richter) and \\"lion taming\\" (Gilels) might mean something to you. Further back in history, there are some other remarkable performances (e.g. pre-war Backhaus), but those are for collectors who can put up with tinny sounds.The last word therefore has to be that with Richter (Leinsdorf or Maazel) and Gilels (Reiner or Jochum) you are at the top of the bracket. It's like Federer and Nadal, except that in this case you are the winner, whichever you choose!
