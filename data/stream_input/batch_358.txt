B0000DD7LB|5.0|I really like this cd. It's that simple. I like her music because it makes me feel good and lets me let go and dance. Plus we're the same age and I relate to her music.  Write mean reviews, and dislike her music, but think before you attack her as a person.  Everyone has the right to an opinion, and personally I feel Britney is attacked much to often.  Think before you speak and remember what harsh words do to you.  She probably doesn't see this, but still, think...that's all. <br />listen to tracks 6 and 12--fun  songs
B0000C8AQM|5.0|This cd is probally one of the best in my collection. If you haven't seen the movie, it's just as great as the soundtrack is.
B000001FRY|5.0|this album could belong to bauhaus, southern death cult, the cure with few differences (I didnt forgot bono).
B00003CXBH|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Mission.  The acting, cinematography and film score were outstanding, and the message was profound. <BR>     A group of Spanish Jesuit missionaries christianize a tribe of Guarani indians living along the border between Paraguay and Brazil.  They set up a mission, San Marcos, and achieve impressive results related to the protection, organization, education and christianization of the Guarani.  The story of their success is told with love and in a way that clearly demonstrates the magnitude of the work that was accomplished, especially in face of the opposition that the priests faced from their Spanish compatriots who wanted to exploit the natural and human resources of the Guarani land.  <BR>     Suddenly Portugal, which was awarded the Guarani land under the treaty of Madrid, demands that San Carlos be closed and the priests withdrawn under threat of military invasion. The film follows the desperate efforts of the priests of San Marcos to  protect the indian land from Portugese invasion and save the mission through diplomatic, pacific and even military action. <BR>     This marvelous story reflects the brutality of a world order of empires dedicated to the pitiless exploitation of the natural and human resources of their colonies.  In the end it all comes down to San Marcos, can it be allowed stand as a beacon of christian love and understanding among the indians or must it be sacrificed to the political realities of empire?
B0000508U6|5.0|In the past decade of so, a transition or sorts has begun in British rock music.  While<BR>many British bands still dwell upon their \\"Beatle-Esque\\" sounds, a new wave of musicians have<BR>begun striking out with their own amazing sounds.  Perhaps the finest of these new wave bands<BR>is Coldplay.<BR> Through haunting lyrics and an imaginative sound, Coldplay's Parachutes is a prime<BR>example of a new wave of Britain rock.  One of the more powerful songs on Parachutes is<BR>Shiver.  Alternately intense and relaxed, Shiver is a classic rock song with a new twist.  Guitarist<BR>Jon Buckland transfers between an amazing rock riff on the chorus, and a subtle guitar line on<BR>the verse, while lead singer Chris Martin cooly sings &quot;you'll always get your way&quot; to a woman<BR>who ignores him, pledging &quot;I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me.&quot;  This amazing<BR>mix of vocals and melody makes Shiver perhaps the best song on the entire album.  <BR> Yet another love song, Yellow, the first major hit off Parachutes, tells of Martin's<BR>apparent love of a woman stating, \\"Look at the stars, look how they shine for you, and<BR>everything you do.\\"  Martin then goes on to state all of the things he would do for the object of<BR>his affection in a modern day love ballad.  Another popular single, Trouble, exhibits Martins<BR>amazing piano skills.  In it, Martin apologizes for &quot;all the stupid things I've done&quot; swearing, &quot;I<BR>never meant to do you wrong.&quot; The lyrics mixed with Martin's voice and piano playing are both<BR>appealing and modest in meaning, while at the same time apologetic and sincere.  <BR> The CD's short title track, containing only Martin's voice accompanied with an acoustic<BR>guitar, is one of the many songs on Parachutes in which Martin pledges his love and tells how he<BR>will patiently wait for the object of his affection.  Although short in length, it is a song of deep<BR>human emotions.  Yet another song containing a pledge of love is Sparks.  Unlike most of the<BR>other songs on Parachutes, Sparks lets guitarist Jon Buckley really show his talent through<BR>melodic guitar rifts.  Martin's lyrics once again are cool and moody as they convey his emotions<BR>through the songs tone.    <BR> Although almost every song on Parachutes is very listenable there are a few dark spots to<BR>keep the CD from perfection.  An example would be the track titled Spies.  Even though the<BR>song contains a good melodic sound, at times the lyrics are a bit silly, imagining a world filled<br />with spies and then seeing &quot;that no one is free, we're all fugitives.&quot;  The song also drags on a bit<BR>too long making it seem repetitive.  Another fault is the first track on the CD don't panic. <BR>Although the songs message is one of hope and persevearance, it lacks the upbeat rythym of the<BR>other tracks.  It is also the only track in which Martin's vocals fail to blend with the melody of<BR>the rest of the band.     <BR> The song Everything's Not Lost has the melancholy piano of a old love ballad as Martin<BR>attempts to stay optimistic through his lyrics even as he's &quot;counting up my demons&quot;  The song<BR>finishes with a slow fade out of &quot;oh yeah, everything's not lost&quot; in a sort of tribute to the Beatles<BR>Hey Jude. Everything's Not Lost is followed by Parachutes' hidden track, Life Is For Living, yet <BR>another Martin apology. It's a rather nice finish to a good CD with a melancholy but rich sound,<BR>filled out by an orchestral accompanyment. <BR> Parachutes is a very appealing record. Although it's not always that exciting to listen to,<BR>it consistantly emits a nice, dreamlike atmosphere which at times is very nice to listen to. Lead<BR>singer Chris Martin may not be the most remarkable singer in the world, but in his vocals and<BR>lyrics, he presents an appealingly real and likable personality that allows listeners to really enjoy<BR>listening to his music.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I just want to say first that although I am not a HUGE Britney fan, I went to the store Tuesday and bought her new album &quot;In the Zone.&quot; To my suprise, I think this may be one of the best albums I have ever listened to. I ranges from so many styles and keeps you interested. She put a lot of effort and time into this and I think it shows. Excellent work Britney. But I need to bring out one subject. The comparison of Britney and Christina Aguilera. I am sick of hearing this because they are both amazing artists. On the other hand I have to point out that even though vocally Britney is not as strong as Christina, I like Britney's voice better. The song &quot;everytime&quot; on her new album proved it. In my opinion, (and think about this honestly), Christina cannot just sing a song. She over sings every song she has ever done. Britney has a great singing voice, she's not a belter, but she has a very soothing and calm voice that does catch you attention. Christina, we've heard your voice before, in Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, not that is doesn't sound good, but its been done. Its very refreshing to hear a voice like Britney's. She doesn't over power the song and her voice is unique and different sounding, it's nice to hear something else. This is just what I think, you don't have to agree but it's my opinion and Britney once again : Great Job, 2 thumbs up.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is a \\"Must See\\" for anyone who is a Johnny Depp fan .It contains an excellent cast of characters including Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi and Sarah Jessica Parker as \\"Poodle\\". With his secret angora fedish Ed Wood sets out to be a big name producer like Orson Wells his idle.As he is told on his first interveiw with a studio executive \\"I don't hire directors with burning desires to tell their storys\\" Shoot what ever crap you want just make sure it is three reels long and that is exactly what he does! Don't cut yourself short it's a riot SEE THIS MOVIE! You will Enjoy it.*****
B00005JM02|5.0|While there were elements that might seem scary to a young child, overall this movie was very enjoyable and good for all ages. You may have to explain about death to smaller kids, though.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|\\"In The Zone\\" by Miss Spears it's the best record that she's put out there, no doubt about it. I have the edition with the bonus track called \\"The Answer\\" and of all the 14 songs, in my opinion, 12 are excellent pieces of dance tunes.<br />Me Agaisnt The Music (10/10): the first single that we all know it's a great tune, with excellent beats, production and arragments.<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom (9/10): when I heard the clip for this song, I Don't like ot at all, but now that I listened to it carefully, it's just a must listen, with fast beat this piece it's made to the dancefloor.<br />Showdown (10/10): one of the best songs on the disc, the beat grabs you from the beginning, it's a midtempo tune, with the sexy lyrics \\"I don't really wanna be a tease, would you undo my zipper please?\\". Finally Britney sounds at look hot at the same time.<br />Breathe On Me (10/10): this song it's a piece that mixes electronica and trance, the lyrics, again, are very sexy and Britney's voice sounds great, breathy and sexy, at the chorus you'll be hooked.<br />Early Mornin'(5/10): this track was produced by Moby and it's a little out of place in this CD, it's a slow and atmospheric tune about the morning after a wild party; nothing in particular, I skip this.<br />Toxic (9/10): this one begins very well, with an 60's intro, the beat and the break of the guitar made the whole tune. It's about get hooked with a toxic guy, this track will definitely make you feet move.<br />Outrageous: (8/10): R. Kelly makes a great job with this track, that has a arabic vibe going on mixed with heavy hip hop beats. Fun tune.<br />Touch Of My Hand (6/10): the famous song about loving yourself it's nothing great, the only good part of this are the lyrics, the rest feels out of place, it happens the same thing that happens with track 5.<br />The Hook Up (10/10): this one it's a mix of Shaggy and Kylie Minogue. The beat it's reagge mixed with electronica, another excellent song in the disc.<br />Shadow (8/10): this one sounds like the Avril Lavigne song \\"I'm With You\\" but in a electronica version. The hand of The Matrix feels TOOOO much in this one. The lyrics are very simple and the good part comes with the chorus.<br />Brave New Girl (9/10): a very happy tune, about a girl who finds herself. It has a fast beat, and a guitar that reminds me a lot to the \\"Ray Of Light\\" intro from the disc of the same name by Madonna.<br />Everytime (10/10): this one it's a haunting tune, with nothing but a piano and strings. The lyrics are just great and touching.<br />Remix (10/10): I usually don't care about remixes, but this one it's so hot, very good and actually kinda better than the orinigal version of the track.<br />The Answer (Bonus Track): this one has a great beat, something like you've never heard from Britney before, P. Diddy made a good job with this one.<br />This CD has almost no fillers, and you can easily listen from teh beginning to the very end and enjoy every track. Spears made a really great work with this new release, leaving behind the bubblegum pop of her previous releases, bought it you won't be dissapointed.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I thought Britney's 3rd cd, \\"Britney,\\" turned out to be the best of the three cds she had released. This was after having expected the cd to be crap, based on the first single, \\"I'm A Slave 4 U.\\" It's a song that eventually grew on me, but thank goodness that it wasn't representative of the rest of the cd.<br />Apparently, I didn't learn my lesson about pre-judging Britney solely on the first single released from an album that time. <br />I completely understand Britney's critics, but still, there's just something about her and her music that I love. So I was really disappointed when I heard \\"Me Against the Music,\\" especially with it being a collaboration with Madonna. You'd think that it would be a much better song, with Madonna on the track, and since Britney obviously now has something to prove to everyone. So, again, I was completely expecting trash and to totally be let down. <br />But thank goodness, once again, because pretty much every song on the cd is much better than \\"Me Against the Music\\" and its remix! Britney comes back in a way you wouldn't believe on this cd! I don't much care for the lyrics, but the music is unbelievable! I love the way she keeps surprising me, and she is very progressive in her sound on this cd, even more so than on her last one. Almost every song sounds like it could be a hip hop song. <br />Songs like \\"Outrageous\\" and \\"Toxic\\" really take the cake and are most likely two of the tracks you'll want to play over and over again! Ideally, she would release one or both of these as singles, and DJs should definitely play these songs at clubs and parties. \\"Brand New Girl\\" is a Revlon (or some other make-up)commercial waiting to happen, as the music and the chorus of that song totally fit an advertising exec's dreams! \\"Breathe On Me\\" is very reminiscent of Madonna's \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories\\" days with a sexy dance sound that can't be ignored. \\"Shadow\\" would make an excellent release, if it weren't for the fact that it sounds so muchlike Avril Lavigne's \\"I'm With You.\\" I really wish Britney had been presented with \\"Shadow\\" beforehand. And I just have to mention \\"Showdown\\" and \\"The Hookup\\" just because of their unique and catchy sound. <br />Aside from \\"Outrageous\\" and \\"Toxic,\\" though, the one song on this cd that totally grabbed my attention was \\"Everytime.\\" It's a little Janet Jackson-ish, but the piano is very nice and emotional, totalling befitting of what she's singing about. This is probably one of the stronger songs on the cd, lyrically and generally. It's obviously about her and Justin Timberlake, and I really have to applaud her for A) recording her most emotional song yet and B) singing such a nice and apologetic song about Justin after he totally ripped her to shreds in his song/video, \\"Cry Me A River.\\" <br />So even if you don't like \\"Me Against the Music,\\" are just plain ready to give up on Britney or totally enjoyed her last cd, definitely give this cd a listen. It's worth it!
0385486804|5.0|Into the Wild was a very intriguing book, it tells the entire story of Chris McCandles and even more. Jon Krakauer points out how most people have at least on some instinctual level, a yearning to go into the wilderness and forage for themselves. This book is a great book for anyone. It tells how Chris McCandles came about his fate, starting with donating all of his savings to charity and then later dumping his car so he only has a few possessions. It is a gripping story that i recommend for anyone.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is the album they should have released after the incredible white album. Both Glyn Johns &quot;Get Back&quot; albums were and are still awful, sounding like a bunch of demos by an average band, and the Beatles were never an average band. Those albums were never released because all 4 Beatles rejected them back in 1969 and 1970, so why should they release them now? After rejecting the Johns versions, John &amp; George gave the tapes to Phil Spector and let him do whatever he liked with them, typical of Lennon and Harrison 1970s behaviour towards the group (&quot;the dream is over&quot;, &quot;I dont believe in Beatles&quot; and that kind of stuff). Spector, being Spector, destroyed the original sound and concept. So here we are, for the first time we have the &quot;should-have-been&quot; Let It Be. We can now at last throw away the &quot;reproduced for disc by Phil Spector&quot; CD, replace it with Naked, reprogram our CD player and play it straight after the White Album, like it should have been back in 1969. <BR>This is an incredibly sounding, excellent CD. Go and buy it NOW. You wont be dissapointed.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Pardon the lame pun in my title, but I love this CD! My favorite song is \\"Toxic.\\" It has an awesome bass that I love to play in my car! And if you really wanna get up and dance, listen to the remix of \\"Me Against The Music\\" at the end of the Album. \\"Brave New Girl\\" has an awesome computer-like voice playing with Britney's. It sounds so cool! Not only that, but Britney combines a lot of types of music. She's got a couple of those classical pop songs, some techo-like songs, a little hip-hop, and some good slow songs with good messages. If you like that in a CD (who wouldn't?) then you will like this CD. My new favorite!
0743201140|4.0|This is a great book, I recommend it to all.<br />VERY IMPORTANT.  You must buy this book new in order to take the online test.  I purchased a used book through the marketplace (always and excellent experience by the way) so the code has already been used.  Now I have to spend the money to buy a new one just to take the test.  In this case buying used does not save you anything.
B00005QIPH|4.0|When I first bought the Strokes CD, I admit I only listened to Last Nite, and I did not look further on. But a few months later, when Someday came out, I realized I was missing out on a great band.<br />I must say I wore out this CD by the way I listened to it so much. Each song is great, every song has great lyrics and a fine set of instruments.<br />Unfortunately though, some of the songs feel like fillers after listening to the CD  many times.  Tracks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 all seem to bore me when I listen to them. But they are good songs.<br />My favorite song is Track 1, Is This It? Iit just seems poetic, and more original than the rest of the slow songs out there. I like to listen to that song when I am in a not so happy mood.<br />Check out Room on Fire, it is even better.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Check out 'Let It Be... Naked' and make your own comparisons: The original album with its overdubbed strings, choir, between-song banter (John singing 'Danny Boy'... badly!) and the outtakes-posing-as-songs 'Maggie Mae' and 'Dig It'. Or the new version with its straight-up, straight-faced arrangement of the original's songs, complete with differently sung verses and an overall, cleaner sound.  'One After 909' actually suffers a bit from this digital revamp: It ends too abruptly, as if someone ran over to the stereo and turned the volume down as fast as they could.  'Across The Universe' is indeed a revelation, back to it's plucky form, and John's final \\"Jai Guru, deva\\" vocals fade into the distance.  'The Long And Winding Road' is very spare, with an almost demo sound to it, and a welcome absence of harp strings that closed out the original.  'I've Got A Feeling' has a slightly more raw sound, with no gimmicky 'Paul is singing his verse only in this speaker, while John sings in this one'.  'Let It Be' is now made up of different, better takes, and omits the silly \\"And now we'd like to do 'Ark the angels come\\" intro.  The Fly On The Wall bonus disc features bitterness-free band conversation, and bits and pieces of songs from other Beatle/solo albums.  'John's Piano Piece' will eventually become the intro to 'Imagine', and the whole band joins in for George's 'All Things Must Pass'.  This is, first and foremost, a Beatles album for the die-hard fans and the completists.  They'll love it.  They'll welcome it with open arms and ears.  But mostly it's an album to listen to for its sheer curiosity factor.  PS. Check out EMI's guilt-trip message on illegal downloading and copying on the inside of the CD's jewel case!
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|The first Strokes album was good, and was definitely one of my favorites to listen to when it first came out. But it was not all good, some of the songs were plain filler, or at least I think so.<br />While some of this albums songs are mediocre, tracks 2, 7, and 9 in particular, the others are pure genius. Track 8 is a great first ballad by the Strokes, and one of my favorites. Julian Casablancas seems to have expanded his writing, and it shows. The riffs, however, are not exactly original. They are still good riffs, but they have the feel of the 70s, yet it still seems original when mixed with synthesizers or distorted vocals. Keep up the good work, Julian and company.
B0000CNY27|5.0|Kurt Russell's \\"anti-hero\\" image, which Carpenter adores, goes especially well with all the films sequences.  If it wasn't for the amazing soundtrack, the movie would only be half of what it is.  Well, okay, one-third.  I am constantly revisiting this film for inspiration.  Although, watching the hijacked plane go into one of the buildings is a bit eerie, now.  It certainly makes the movie even more intense present day.  I suggest purchasing the newly remastered soundtrack which includes the entire score (previously unreleased), as well as dialogue snipets to go with Carpenter's masterpiece keyboard sequences.
076790592X|4.0|This was an excellent book. Many young people today don't have the priviledge of talking to someone who is older and has a lot of experience in life. Young and old alike can benefit from reading this book. It can really change your outlook on life. Or at least give you something to think about.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I have been a fan of the Beatles for over 30 years and this previously was my least favorite Beatles album. Now with all of the Phil Spector added orchestration removed, what is left is a window into the soul of this music... I would classify it as the new \\"White Album\\". The highlights of this reborn material are the stripped down version of The Long And Winding Road with Paul's now more poignant vocals and piano accompaniment. I also greatly enjoyed  Don't Let Me Down, One After 909 and Across The Universe. I actually prefer the \\"Spectorized\\" version of Get Back. The real test though was would my seven year-old son like it? A most enthusiastic yes as I watched him in the rear-view mirror rock out to the various cuts...33 years have passed and the Beatles still reveal that they knew how make ageless music...
0805209999|5.0|In Franz Kafka's novel 'The Trial', Joseph K., an upstanding citizen of a civilized state, is arrested in his home on charges that are never disclosed. His accuser is never disclosed, nor is the law explained. The dehumanizing bureaucracy and arcane, corrupt legal process is, despite the bizarre character of Kafka's novel, both comic and chilling. Among other things, 'The Trial' is a warning to good people everywhere who, through their failure to act against usurpations of authority and abuses of power, are complicit in the illegal or unethical actions of those exercising control over their society. Joseph K. is undone as much by his insistence on maintaining perfect decorum and civility as he is by accepting the notion that he has no right or agency to ignore or overcome the ridiculous and immoral process through which he is destroyed. Kakfa's expressed fears remain relevant today even for those who, living in a democratic nation, assume that due legal process guarantees justice, the protection of individual privacy, and subsequent civil liberties.<br />Copyright 2003 by Brian D.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|In the U.S., Michael Jackson had 13 post-Motown (solo era) number one hits.  They were: Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Rock With Me, Billie Jean, Beat It, Say Say Say, We Are the World, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man in the Mirror, Dirty Diana, Black or White, and You Are Not Alone.  Factoring in the U.K. chart, we can add Earth Song and Blood on the Dance Floor.  But songs like Say Say Say, We Are the World and Blood on the Dance Floor are missing.  Other songs, like Smooth Criminal and You Rock My World, weren't number one hits on either chart.  Which chart was Sony using?
0671027344|2.0|Reading other reviews has reinforced my belief that this is the perfect book for teenageers who wouldn't otherwise read anything. Everyone else should steer clear. Written in a dumbed-down journal style filled with random words in quotation marks (presumably stylistically, but really annoying), Chbolsky tells the story of a disturbed but intelligent uncool kid who meets Alternative Friends and finds his Coolness Within.<br />Like Charlie, the protagonist, I was 15 in 1991, so I thought I could relate to the world this book is set in. I was wrong. This book sets up a fictionalized version of the 90s that Chbolsky (I would imagine around 25 in 1992) would like to think existed, but didn't. Overall, this book was pretentious and so breezy it could float away. I could tell it was trying to be deep and significant, but totally missed its mark. Other writers have dealt with misfits in so many better, non-superficial ways. Salinger this is not (although I have a feeling it would like to be). When I reached the end, I discovered that this book was published by MTV. 'Nuff said.<br />If you are (or know someone who is) a 14-year-old who doesn't fit in, or are someone who NEVER READS ANYTHING but needs a book for your Friendster profile, this is the book for you. Everyone else, stay away.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I am a big fan of all kinds of music, especiall 80's type hard rock. I am also a huge fan of Shania Twain now. If you want a live dvd of any artist out there I suggest this one as one of the best out there. Also check out her other dvds if you haven't already...
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the best CD I have! This is the only CD that I know all the words to all the songs. I highly reccomend it to everyone!
B00008OWZC|4.0|I bought it yesterday, but after only a few listenings I'm able to say the first cd is the best. The other two drag on and on, especially in Moby Dick - I prefer the version from The Song Remains The Same, seven minutes shorter. A few minutes in the one from How The West Was Won and you get lost. Dazed and Confused lives up to its title because this is the mood it gets you in midway. Whole Lotta Love is also too long for its own good.<br />I agree with the reviewer who complained about why songs as great as No Quarter and Thank You have been left out from either this cd and the dvd. Of course you can't include all Zep great songs because they've got too many, but what about Tangerine too? Missing fom either these triple cd and the dvd as well. Certainly I was hoping this one, alongside No Quarter and Thank You would find their way to any of these two releases but sadly they have not.<br />Something I don't think many people have wondered is why all these songs haven't been put into 2 cds, since the whole running time is a little more than two hours. I guess the price would have been lower though it's not that expensive, at least where I got it - 18,99 Euros.<br />In a nutshell - better than The Song Remains The Same of course, but still not the definitive Zep live album. Maybe next time....<br />3/5.
B00005JMFO|4.0|A confession: I love the pedigree of this film. Richard Curtis, Hugh Grant et al. contributed their talents to Four Weddings and A Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones. I own and rewatch all of those movies. <BR>Love Actually did not disappoint. Think Robert Altman meets Four Weddings and a Funeral. Several sweet, bittersweet, and downright painful relationships unfold during the movie. In one way or another, one story ends up being linked to another which is linked to another...<BR>A synopsis of the stories...<BR>Hugh Grant is the new, dashing British Prime Minister who has fallen in love with his tea lady...the tea lady lives next door to a lusty young minx who is throwing herself at  her boss Alan Rickman...Rickman is intrigued but perplexed as he has been married for years to Emma Thompson (Hugh Grant's sister in the movie)...Thompson meanwhile is comforting her best friend, Liam Nesson, who has recently been widowed...Neeson is helping his 10-year old stepson deal with a crush...and so on. Somewhere in there Colin Firth shows up as a novelist in love with his Portuguese maid and two shy stand-ins to a porn movie meet and fall in love...and there is a hilarious scene stealing performance of a singer named \\"Billy Mack\\" who wants his worst ever Christmas song to make #1.<BR>Curtis' point: Love is all around us and you just need to open your eyes to see it. But it's not all idyllic romantic love in this movie: you'll see platonic love, dying love, unrequited love and so on.<br />Anyway it's a great Christmas movie-adults only-and I highly recommend it.
0783229526|1.0|I have completed the awesome feat of actually watching &quot;Fear and loathing in Las Vegas&quot; through and I have conducted a major scientific analysis on this flick. I consulted my neighbors who all happen to be  highly esteemed scientists and they provided me with some interesting opinions about what this film might be about. I have to add at this point, that i live in an apartment building inhabited only by sociologists, psychologists, ornithologists and marxists, and i often discuss with them matters of art that seem to escape me. These are the conclusions I gathered from my discussion with them:<br />1. &quot;Fear and loathing..&quot; actually DOES have a plot. The fact that a spectacularly overwhelming majority of the audience failed to see the plot is besides the point. The same amount of people also failed to understand Einstein's theory. Be careful though. This does in no respect mean that &quot;Fear and loathing...&quot; is an ingenius film much the same as Einstein couldnt direct a film even though he might've been a genius. Get it? Me neither..<br />2.&quot;Fear and loathing...&quot; has as much of a plot as all David Lynch's films do together. To anyone disputing this or needing it to be explained i recommend the highly succesful detox programm called &quot;Watch Fear and Loathing again. And Again. Part II&quot;.<br />3. &quot;Fear and loathing..&quot; is a state of the art...art film, which actually is filmed real time by a director seriously suspended in between reality scapes and played by actors who are actually beyond tripped out with the purpose of providing us with a complex and therefore difficult to understand map with the limits of the human mind. It could have been French.<br />4. &quot;Fear and Loathing...&quot; is NOT a film. It is actually part of a secret government programm aimed at discouraging our youth in experimenting with a plethora of different drugs simoultaneously. Judging from the reviews here though the programm has failed.Your tax dollars at work once again.<br />5. &quot;Fear and Loathing...&quot; will be undisputably understood when Part Two is released (Fear and Loathing in Modevideo) which is due for release in 50 years time. Those alive till then will be awed at the cosmogonic meaning of this film and will ultimately understand how silly they were when they were young and missed the idea because of their naivity.<br />6. &quot;Fear and Loathing&quot; is actually an alien film recovered during a UFO crash in South Siberia. The original has -of course- been kept from the public eye and this an adaptation providing us with a glipse into the alien mindset. Did you notice the scene at the beginning with the reptiles at the bar. Well, WINK! Do we have to spell it out for ya????<br />    I do admit that the aforementioned analysis theses are somewhat contradicting. But, I must also admit that i consider myself to be intellectually inadequate to pinpoint which one comes closest to the truth. I think that in reality we all are. <BR>   This is a film to be treasured for the ages. And, to be incomprehended for an equal amount of time. Peace...
B000002KON|5.0|This, I have no doubt, is the most underappreciated album in rock n' roll history. Not only is it, without any doubt, the Kinks' best, it should be on every list of top British albums, right up there with Sgt. Pepper, Tommy, Sticky Fingers and Dark Side of the Moon. The Kinks are best known as one of the leading bands of the British Invasion of the mid-60s, and for hits like You Really Got Me and Waterloo Sunset, but on this, their finest work, Ray Davies and the boys make no attempt to invade. They stay right where they are, and discuss the bleak shape of like in the UK in the late 60s. That may explain why it didn't do as well outside the UK as albums by the Who or the Stones; Arthur is a much smaller affair, more local in the issues it tackles. Musically and thematically, though, it's a genuine work of genius, and while the album refers to a very small frame in time and place, it's still relevant, and it still lingers.<br />As a rock opera, Arthur isn't as coherent as others from the period like Tommy or Jesus Christ Superstar, but it still holds its own at the very least as a concept album. If you still want a plot, the story of Arthur, as written by Ray Davies and Julian Mitchell, can be found in the CD booklet, and it may give some frame within which all the songs can fit, but it's not necessary. The story is of Arthur Morgan, average working class citizen, and his family; it takes place on the day his son, Derek, moves with his family to Australia. The story follows Arthur's and Derek's relationship, but most of the songs are flashbacks to Arthur's life. In reality, Arthur's story is the story of Britain, and the album is perfect satire. It manages to be hilarious and at the same time touching and thought-provoking, and the lyrics are sharp and venomous. Thus, songs like `Shangri-La' and `She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina' are powerful statements about the working class in England, `Some Mother's Son' - a song about the death of Arthur's eldest son, Eddie, in the Korean war - is a touching song that could be about any soldier who was killed in any war anywhere, and `Nothing To Say', a song sung by Derek about his relationship with his father, is actually a summing of the feeling in the UK at the time. Like Chaplin, Benini and Monty Python, Mr. Davies also discovered that the best way to make a point is by making people smile, and the light-hearted sound and catchy melodies of this album are what make it classic satire just like `The Great Dictator' and `Life Of Brian'.<br />Aside from that, many of the songs on Arthur stand fully by themselves as terrific rock songs. The bandmates' instrumental prowess, while they're still no Who, is at its best - Dave Davies supplies some of his finest guitar work for Arthur. Also, while the production is light and small and the melodies are simple - which gives the album a lot of strength, special attention should be given to the arrangements, which are brilliant and perfect. The inclusion of a horn section on some of the songs adds a lot, and the horn arrangements are terrific. The best horns can be found on the album's greatest track, `Shangri-La', which remains one of the finest songs of all time. The different segments all combine wonderfully, from the acoustic opening to the hard, horn driven middle part, to the slow and powerful ending. The lyrics, too, as well as Ray's vocal performance, are splendid. The album has many other wonderful moments: `She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina', which sounds almost like a Monty Python skit, is funny and strong satire at its finest, with brilliant lyrics. `Mr. Churchill Says' is another brilliant piece of political commentary, and the bit in the middle where the sirens come in is absolutely chilling.<br />`Brainwashed' is another strong social-political number, which is attributed to Eddie's son (Arthur's grandson), Ronnie - that excuses itself, because by attributing the songs to a character in the story the Kinks don't commit to oneopinion or line of thinking, but when considered by itself `Brainwashed' is an incredibly strong, venomous piece:<br />The aristocrats and bureaucrats <BR>Are dirty rats for making you what you are <BR>They're up there and you re down here <BR>You're on the ground and they're up with the stars <BR>All your life they've kicked you around and pushed you around<BR>Till you can't take any more<BR>To them you're just a speck of dirt<BR>But you don't want to get up off the floor <br />`Yes Sir No Sir' and `Some Mother's Son' both discuss military life and the part the military plays in everyday life - `Yes Sir No Sir' is a funny and strong satire (with great guitar work), while `Some Mother's Son' is a tender and touching ballad, but both songs complete each other. And once again, `Nothing To Say' is a lovely rock song which sums up the feelings of the album better than any other song. Even the lesser songs - `Victoria', `Australia', `Young And Innocent Days', `Drivin'' and `Arthur' - are well worthy of much praise, and they all fit neatly and perfectly into the bigger picture. That is the sign of a great album, and that's why I compared Arthur with Tommy and Sgt. Pepper, both of whom also share this quality.<br />The Kinks will never be as widely recognized as their peers the Stones and the Who, because they were never as global, but their heritage will remain. On Arthur the Davies brothers brought their three chord songs, strictly pentatonic guitar and simplistic rock n' roll drums to new levels or artistry, not to mention the lyrics; and Arthur rocks like few other mainstream rock of the time. Add it to your collection - you won't regret it.
B00009W0U4|3.0|By now, &quot;Irreversible&quot; is building a massive reputation for being a ultraviolent film and on this feature alone it's becoming one of the most known indie films of the year.<BR>    The question whether it deserves this reputation in this respect should be answered with a thunderous yes. &quot;Irreversible&quot; is a film filmed backwards. It begins with a disturbing murder in an S§M club, continues with the frantic search by a small mob for the person who gets killed and proceeds with probably the most unsubtle rape scene ever recorded on celluloid.<BR>   But this french film actually has more things going for it. The camera work (far from the &quot;dramamine&quot; metaphors that others see) is brilliant. Photography and camera work go hand-in-hand as they build a dark doomy environ where the whole story keeps settling in geometrically. The cast is exceptionally picked as the actors come across perfectly as the everyday characters involved in a sudden nightmare.<br />   I personally dont understand why the graphic violence annoys certain people. The violence depicted in this film is but a mere fraction compared to the real, daily violence going on in the real world, and in most cases not far (if not right in) from our own neighborhoods. The bombardment -for example- of civilians is not &quot;annoying&quot; because the media try hard to hide it from the public but this film is? Lets be serious.<BR>   Back to the film, i loved the way the landscape brightens as the film progresses to its end (which is of course the beginning) and as the colors open up as from a dommy eternal sunset to a colorful dawn, obviously the directors intent to emphasize contrast.<br />    The only minus in my opinion, was that the &quot;end&quot; was basically an anticlimax and for this it loses in my view a couple of stars. On one hand this is understandable keeping in mind that the rest of the film is super intimidating, but nevertheless, a different idea should've been used to climax the pivot of the story. It wasnt easy but the fact that it was predictable spoils an otherwise very good film.<BR>    A disturbingly unsubtle addition to dark cinema.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I liked this movie well enough, but it is not quite 5 stars, yet at the same time it is not a 4. I thought that the actors did a great job and the plot was surprisingly good for a movie based on a comic book. I liked the idea behind the hero, him having super powers, but at the same time being blind. The villeins were good to. Not really stupid, crazy people, but ruthless, criminal masterminds. I would recommend this movie to people who like action or super-hero movies.
B0000TB03W|5.0|She may have taken a couple years off from recording and touring, but her first concert since her return with the fantastic &quot;Up!&quot; album shows just how great a performer Shania is.  From the uptempo boot stompers like &quot;Any Man of Mine&quot; and &quot;Honey I'm Home&quot; to the tender, heartfelt ballads like &quot;When You Kiss Me&quot; and &quot;You're Still the One,&quot; Shania shows herself to be one of country's top performers.  This DVD concert makes you feel like you're there, and leaves you wanting more great country music from Shania!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|It is finaly great to hear the Let it Be Album as it was meant to be heard . No over dubs or strings . Just great pure rock n roll music nicely polished up  . All the songs sound much better raw as they were originaly recorded . And all the song tracks selected flow naturally from one song to another . I am glad they removed Dig it and Maggie Mae and substituted Dont Let me Down in their place . \\"Highly recommended \\" go out and buy it .
B0000DD7LB|1.0|When I first listened to this whole cd, I wanted to gouge my eyes out.  This so called performer has no talent at all.  The sound of the songs are very simplistic and remind me of her last three albums.  She does not deserve to be called a musician.  A musician actually makes music and has intelligence.  She is way too materialistic and cares about image.  Also her voice sounds horrible.  I have seen footage of her on Star Search.  Her voice was great back then.  Britney can be summed up in one word..Obnoxious.
0385504209|4.0|A high-speed romp that uses elements from history for the clues. This one was hard to put down. Found myself pulling out my old art history textbooks to look at details from paintings. Lots of fun - thumbs up on this one!

0156027321|5.0|I was intrigued by the description - boy adrift at sea with zoo animals, that and the fact that most folks seemed to like it - so I bought it. It starts slowly - and then picks up speed when the survival-at-sea story begins. I expected an interesting tale - I didn't expect to be laughing out loud in spots. The character Pi's bulleted lists of tips for surviving at sea with a large wild animal aboard are a scream (that and I loved the tiger's name). I really enjoyed this one and would recommend it to anyone.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Johnny Depp is hot and he's on the cover.... do I need to say more? That alone is a GREAT reason for buyin the CD...<BR>OK, for those not so obsessive as moi, if you loved the movie, buy the Cd. Then you can picture that gorgeous Captain (no NOT Barbossa!) Jack Sparrow...er...ahem. I mean, picture your fave scene while listening along. Great upbeat theme music for the car too.<BR>If you didn't like the movie, but you liked the music... well, that's obvious, get the CD.<BR>If you didn't like the movie, I don't like you. &gt; _ &lt; (J/K)<br />For all you Pirates fans out there, ROCK ON!.....savvy?
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon 5 is basically one of those bands to take America by storm. Where have they been hiding?...Wherever it's been it's been far too long. Bands like Maroon 5 only seem to surface every once in a great while. They have a unique twist on their music simply by taking sad/depressing subject matter and putting it to a snappy-happy/funky beat. I don't know whether to grab a box of tissues or step out on the dance floor. This is a great album for the band cause nearly all of the songs are phenomenal...you don't need to hit the skip button. I would have to say my favorite tracks on this album are &quot;Harder to Breathe,&quot; &quot;This Love,&quot; and &quot;Through with You.&quot; So if you are looking for some &quot;different&quot; type of music...Maroon 5 is a definitely a must-have!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I'm not saying that this was a bad movie- it wasn't. The Matrix Reloaded provides a very intrinsic chapter in the Matrix saga. However, the plot is not half as amazing as the first or third movies, while watching those two, there is no other opportunity for thought in your mind. The fight scenes are impressive - as always- but they go on too long, past the climax, and start to feel rather dragged out. However, important new characters are introduced in this chapter (along with one of the coolest French baddies ever to hit the screen) <BR>The DVD has tons of special features, which is always a nice plus. They include a preview for the Animatrix, whixh is also a very cool DVD in this series, providing background on the Osiris, as well as the new kid that follows Neo around in this second movie.<BR>Overall, I'd say buy the DVD if you're in love with the matrix. It's not a bad buy, and it's certainly worth th money.... and it may help tide you over until Matrix Revolutions is released on DVD.
0764113496|5.0|Unlike Turkish or Japanese (in which the irregular verbs can be counted on the fingers of one hand, at least in the case of Japanese), Russian, like Latin, Spanish, German, and many other languages, has lots of both regular and irregular verbs. Spanish, which I know better than Russian, has 22 commonly used verbs that are irregular in the present indicative tense, and the same 18 are also irregular in the present subjunctive. But 12 of those have the same pattern in the present indicative, so once you get this idea, the situation is not as bad as it at first seems. There are similar patterns in Russian, and it helps to have them laid out for you and explained, which this book does. As someone pointed out, the hundreds of pages of regularly conjugated verbs really aren't needed once you get the pattern for the regular ones, and this book could have been reduced to a few pages that way, but for beginners it's still useful to have that.<br />Considering that language learners now have the choice of getting handheld language translation computers like the well-known models from Franklin, which aren't that much more than this book, and which will give you the definitions of 60,000 words, along with other notes on the grammar, games, word completion, and other features, it's interesting to see that these books are still surviving so well.<br />One useful feature is the section where the colloquial uses of various verbs are explained, which is useful too, and the Spanish version of this book has the same feature. This section focuses on commonly used verbal phrases that are not unlike the ones in use in English that cause so many problems for foreign speakers. These are phrases like &quot;run away from, or come up on,&quot; in English. But since English has done away with case markers and now mostly relies on word order, there are many more thousands of them in English than in Russian or Spanish. NTC's recent dictionary of English verbal phrases and phrasal verbs listed 12,000.<br />But getting back to this book, this is still an excellent reference for the beginner to intermediate speaker and I can recommend it for that.2,000. <br />But getting back to this book, this is still an excellent reference for the beginner to intermediate speaker and I can recommend it for that.

0375414053|1.0|Don't buy this book. Not only is it poorly written, but I can watch the news to have mainstream culture demonize me and other women. I also was completly offended with the cushy background of the author and her purported tone that she spoke for so many women. Please!
076790592X|5.0|This is such a heart touching book. I've read it twice and plan to read it again. I was in tears and I am not one who cries easily. Everyone young and old will benefit greatly reading this short masterpiece of life's greatest lesson. Reading this book has made me reflect on the way I have lived my life and I am glad I read it. I have learned a great lesson and I strongly feel that everyone who reads this book will agree that there is a great lesson being taught through this book.I plan to give this book as Christmas gifts this year to my friends and family. Thank you Professor Rhymes for recommending this book.
B00005N6KG|5.0|When you find yourself searching, in need a pair of headphones, you should ask yourself what you want from your music. Do you want a sound that seems to cover you ear, muffling the noise and perhaps minimizing exposure, or do you want purity of sound that closeness of proximity can bring? Do you want a design that might be right and that might not, with those newer designs that hook behind the ears or those sectional ones that sometimes pinch, or do you want a more basic model that has been time tested? While you might not think of it, how you answer that question makes all the difference in the world. And if you're picky and want something that has met the measure of thousands of hours of this reviewer's personal testing, then this model works.<br />Before the advent of volume control on headphones, this was only the way to go and is still the type I fall back on when I can't find that type. That's because they have a durable plastic structure, an adjustable fit that is pretty hard to wear out, and speakers that seem to take a sonic beating before giving out. Its actually amazing when you note the beating they can take, with so many other products falling by the consumer wayside. Also, they fit firmly in the ear, seating themselves properly, and the plug connecting the headphones to the player rarely wear rout. Besides that, they have one other thing going for them. They are formed well, especially around the speakers.<br />While many may not see this as a necessity, I've actually experimented with all types of headphones and I've found something that can happen when straying away from Sony. If you're lucky you'll get something that is wired decently, sometimes popping and giving the equal to a shock in the ear and sometimes not, and at worst you'll have a form with a jagged surface. While that might not be bad with something that fits over the ear, something inserted directly into the ear is dangerous when not formed properly. And that's why I swear by these because I've never, in well over 50 pairs of this model alone, had it happen.<br />If you look at these and you think they are to basic and that the price says something on lower quality, you'd be wrong in many a right. They are perhaps plain in design, not getting fancy in color or the way they fit, but they deliver sounds in only a way that Sony seems to understand. They also last, allowing you to get your maximum use out of the product. Personally, I find that to be the best way to secure loyalty as a customer and something Sony seems to understand. And they've been doing that for me for well over a decade.ause I've never, in well over 50 pairs of this model alone, had it happen.<br />If you look at these and you think they are to basic and that the price says something on lower quality, you'd be wrong in many a right.

0385512104|5.0|This is the first review I have ever offerred for any medium. I just finished this book and cannot stop recomending it. As the parent of a 7 year old autistic girl I have often wondered &quot;what is going on in that head of hers?&quot;. I don't pretend to have all the answers because of this book, but Mr. Haddon's ability to let us take a peek is truely astonishing. I found this book to be a quick read that was funny, heartbreaking, and wonderful. I know I will be more tolerant of my daughter's quirks and habits as a result of this book...quite an effect for a piece of writing to have. If you or anyone you know is effected by autism this is a MUST READ.
B0000029LG|5.0|&quot;HIStory Past, Present, And Future: Book 1&quot; is a two-disc album.  The first CD is a compilation of fifteen Michael Jackson's greatest hits from 1979-1992.  The second CD is his fifteen newly recorded tracks.  Every track featured on this set explains why he's &quot;the king of pop&quot;.  These songs show the audience the his life paths within the times.  <br />Every past hit is as catchy and as wonderful as the one next to it.  They're taken from his previous four highly successful albums: &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, and &quot;Dangerous&quot;.  Behind his unique dance moves is some of the most unique music in the universe.  His voice is wonderful.  The outshining tracks featured are &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Something&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, and &quot;Thriller&quot;, which were recorded on the greatest selling album in worldwide history(26 million US, 50 million worldwide).  These tracks marked new territory for pop music's future.  Its high quality proves that such success was well-deserved.  His musical evolution through the years is fun to follow.  Whether it's disco, R&amp;B, pop, or rock, he's mastered it.<br />His new tracks follow his hard times through the controversies he was faced with in 1993.  Is anger and sadness are well-expressed.  Every track was written well.  His platinum hit singles &quot;Scream&quot;(duet with Janet Jackson) and &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; state the album's theme.  His most controversal track of his career is featured on this album: &quot;They Don't Care About Us&quot;.  Its hardhitting lyrics are performed very well.  The cover singles live up to the originals: &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Little Susie&quot;, and &quot;Smile&quot;.  Most tracks combine pop and rock.  The musical theme remains one of the most unique in musical history, as his past singles.  <br />&quot;HIStory Past, Present, and Future: Book 1&quot; is an essential album for any Michael Jackson fan.  Every track explains why he was the #1 selling artist of the 1980's.  The 52-page booklet is also worth reading, explaining the history of these tracks and of his career.  Many listeners will be pleased with this album.  Long live the king of pop!
B000092ZYY|5.0|I dunno why people keep ranting how dissapointing this album was...Well, maybe it's a bit weird like Amnesiac and Kid A...but then, those albums you either love or hate. If you're seeking to try out Radiohead for the first time, get their undeniable gem, Ok Computer. The next three are weirder, and The Bends before OkC is more guitarish.<BR> HTTT takes a few spins to get into...but the songs are fabulous.<BR>Sail to the Moon is so pretty, it truly takes me away. Myxamotosis is sorta tecnoish. Alot of the songs are kind of dark feeling...but in a good way. There There is really good, and sunds like something from OkC. So does the great Wolf at the Door. It's like a mix of all their stuff.<BR> Anyway...I say give this a go, and, while it's not as tripped out as Kid A and Amnesiac...it's not normal either.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|\\"In the Zone\\" is Britney Spears forth album release.  This propels her to greater standings as a musician and as a career standpoint.  She co-wrote eight tracks.  Her more adult theme gives her music a new vibe opposite of previously known from her.  This album introduces everyone to her new dance style with some new pop sounds.  Her experimental techno sounds symbolize this.  Every dance beat will attract many to the dance floor.  The collaborations with Madonna, Ying Yang Twins, R. Kelly, and Moby give \\"In the Zone\\" a unique twist.  \\"Me Against the Music\\" introduces this musical experience brilliantly, sharing about what's to come.  Madonna and she have perfect chemistry for this track.  Her ballads \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\" are emotional.  Britney haters may begin loving her after hearing \\"In the Zone\\".  Those looking for a fresh pop/dance sound should buy this album.  Every track is catchy.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is not typical Britney.  She took a chance, and I think she did an amazing job repackaging her musical style.  I think Madonna could have had an influence on this album, because this is a new Britney.  She sings about masturbation (\\"Touch of My Hand\\") and has a lot of sexual songs.  She is getting more personal with her music, which makes this a soul-bearing masterpiece.  The lyrics and beats are awesome.  Okay, Brave New Girl is atrocious, but the rest of the CD is unbelievable.  Give it a listen, I'm sure you'll be impressed with the changes she's made in her career.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|I will admit, I have yet to be at a concert for over a decade.  Coldplay is one of my favorite bands and when I saw this DVD come out, I was thrilled.  From the beginning, I was on my feet in front of my television for a good two hours experiencing the phenemonal energy flow through my blood while watching Coldplay Live and browsing its features.  This concert was energetic and lucid.  Though it was basically the band playing their music within a huge light show, the atmosphere just seemed so much alive.  I was impressed more so when they got deeper into their show as it seemed the band itself became more alive and the energy reflected off of them onto the fans.  This is truly a remarkable collection to own, especially if you are a Coldplay fan.  It also includes 2 new songs, which are not too bad, but I'll leave that for you to judge.  I would strongly recommend purchasing this DVD/CD.  The energy produced will flow into your stream of blood quickly and will add vivid colors into your imagination!  If money is an issue, try getting this burned.  If you are not a huge fan of Coldplay, but still enjoy their music from time to time, try borrowing this DVD and check it out.  (My favorite performance was when they did the song &quot;Yellow&quot; :&gt; )
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Being a HUGE Godsmack fan, I was dying to hear this cd. When I bought it, oh man...the heaviest of Godsmack this far. <br />&quot;I Am&quot; - this song is a heavy heavy driven ballad of not knowing what your purpose is. <br />&quot;Serenity&quot; - this song is like a up-to-date version of <BR>&quot;Voodoo&quot;, a really really great song to listen to for needing to calm down.  <br />&quot;Straight out of Line&quot; - the first single off of this cd, its arguable that this song isnt the best on the cd, but its a song with pure anger and rage inside of your own battlefield (the sounds in the beginning). This song is very hard driven, and is worth every minute of airtime. <br />&quot;Releasing the Demons&quot; - my personal favorite. This song is not as hard as the others, but it stands its ground. Its lyrics and overall sound represent a confusing world of releasing what bad side you have of yourself. Noticeable for its lyrics and the haunting ending, this song is 100% badass. <br />There are many more badass songs on here, and being a true Godsmack fan, they held theyre word when they said the best is yet to come, cause this is by far the best I have heard yet.

B00005JKHP|2.0|Footnote: Official Review: ** 1/2 (two star and a half star rating)<br />In 1979, Robert Wise's (West Side Story, The Sound of Music, The Haunting) highly budgeted, enormously special effects laden, immensely epic, and dramatically devoid of feeling Star Trek: The Motion Picture hit theaters around the world introducing new fans to the new continuing chronicles of Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), stoic Science Officer half human/half Vulcanian Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and sardonically comedic Doctor Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; Mc Coy (DeForest Kelley). In the vast horizon of space, there appears to be an immensely lethal gigantic space being intelligence (that goes by the name of V'Ger) that after already easily annihilating several Kilingon Birds of Prey and a Federation Deep Space Station facility is on a direct collision course with the planet Earth. So of course the United Federation of Planets allows recently promoted Admiral Kirk to helm the U.S.S. Enterprise on an extremely vital emergency mission to investigate the mystery alien's intentions. Unfortunately for all but the most blindly devoted of the Trekkie fan base, the film lacked the one crucial engineering ingredient that made the original series glisten amongst all the other one-dimensionally conventional entertainments of the time, character, dimensionality, and humanity.<br />Though we do see momentary glimpses of the Shatner/Nimoy/Kelly character dynamic that propelled the original series ascendance into the syndication stratosphere, Star Trek: The Motion Picture creatively concentrates on a mightily bland ambiguous creature that never really fulfills on it's promise of threat to the audience (only cerebrally never emotionally), adheres too stridently to an old Hollywood pacing structure (form the 50's and 60's) that clashes as badly to Star Trek as platform shoes stand out at a Moshe pit, focuses on a very uninteresting romance between the first officer and a bald female navigator (both before and after one of them becomes an android), and horrendously confuses telling a intensely jargon-filled space odyssey with that of concocting a compellingly motion picture. Though the grave somber literate bent of the film is not lost upon this reviewer, the emblematic spice of argumentative dissension between friends, the palpable and utterly real danger of space travel, spontaneous comedic innuendo that punctuated pompousness away from the drama, and the very fabric of camaraderie that richly effortlessly soared in the series is about as subdued and unappreciatively undeveloped as comedy was previously in any old Dragnet episode. Wise only in a very theatrical or heavily staged manner even remotely alludes to the venerable dependably timeless elements that made Star Trek always and exclusively Star Trek. His \\"lively\\" touches of character spontaneity, enthusiastic mood, and jovial levity would have been made traumatically more believable if only they had been frantically re-imaged in a wax museum showcase instead. <br />One dedicated fan may point out the fact that in the initial scenes of Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Spock was undergoing a Vulcanian emotional purging ceremony entitled Kolinahr. Given his increasing resolute attempts to purge his own emotions as a character, these strides may have had a &quot;direct&quot; (maybe even commendable consistency of character to some) effect on the profuse mundane character uneventfulness that is being described. This certainly is attributed in the film but where oh where is that legendary DeForest Kelley or James Doohan wit when we ravenously agonize over their absence of them most?  Sure there are minor colorful moments prudishly infrequently dispensed throughout the film from point to point. Yet this &quot;levity&quot; is never relentlessly exceptional enough to lug 136 minutes around with it without considerable waisline coverage issues apparent form head to foot.<br />All in all, despite an all-star cast, mind bogglingly excellent special effects, and a superbly noteworthy soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith (that track was later re-used in the vastly popular Star Trek: The Next Generation), Star Trek: The Motion Picture fails to go where almost all of it's sequels later went on to do, make an entertaining picture. It certainly is worth mention and inclusion to one's cinema-going experiences solely for that legendarily diabolically seductive musical score, watching the U.S.S. Enterprise (accompanied by Goldsmith's eternal score) leaving the Federation Space dock for the first time, viewing the Enterprise warping away into the distance at the film's conclusion, witnessing that infamously beloved Leonard Nimoy eyebrow twinge, and its paternal role as the first feature-length film in the Star Trek film franchise. However don't these scattered moments appear more like anemic scrapes than an entire fluid film ahcievement to you? Other than those inclusions, this is about as barren as the Starship U.S.S. Reliant at the conclusion of Nicholas Meyer's Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan in terms of shear excitement that is. Yet in its favor, its mere trespasses were only excessively bland in comparison with the quality atomic bomb that that was William Shatner's vindictively baleful masterpiece of calamites, Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier. Now that was a cinematic Watergate for the ages.<br />As for the Star Trek: the Motion Picture Director's Cut DVD Special Edition, it's includes a marvelously remastered anamorphic widescreen presentation, a Robert Wise commentary track, 3 documentaries, 11 deleted scenes, and more impressive Star Trek options to shake a replicated steak at. <br />Highly recommended for any Trekkie with a thirst for antiquity, but for all other indifferent non-fans stay as far away from this as you would from the Influencian Flu or Barclay's Proto-morphosis Syndrome. You've been warned<br />P.S. Scotty thin? Naw...<br />Followed by Nicholas Meyer's Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|A friend loaned me this CD and after the first couple of songs (one of which is the single, I believe) I was impressed. However, after a few fast songs Jet gets into some half-baked attempt at balladry--and they fail miserably. I am all for slow songs, but slow songs done right. These are some of the most trite songs I have heard in a while.<br />Basically, if you long for the days when there were only two or threee decent songs on an album and you're happy to pay $10 for that, then by all means dig in. Otherwise, pass this up and go for something with a little more substance.<br />I don't know, maybe some of the bands this album rips riffs from -- Rolling Stones, for instance. If The Verve was sued, then Jet should be in court any day now.<br />One song is a total Oasis rip-off--they even sing like them. Who are they trying to please? Everyone, it seems.<br />Make the music for yoruself guys, it'll play out better for you in the long run.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Like another reviewer, the first two DVD discs played fine in our DVD player.  Discs 3 &amp; 4 would loop between track 1 &amp; 2, and the screen would remain blank.  Could not even bring up the menu or anything. We even exchanged the DVDs for another boxed set, and had the same thing happen.<br />Is there something special about how the second two discs are recorded?<br />Oh, and the review, the movie was great, except for the protrayal of Faramir and bringing Frodo and Sam to Gondor.  That could have been cut to be consistent with the book.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I thought they would keep all the diologue in. Diologue gives the songs little funny moments and the orchrestra is excellent on the orignal. I give this 2 stars just because of the second disc which is excellent. If you could rate both discs separtly I would give disc 1 one star and disc 2 five stars. Also the songs played on the roof cut off really fast (espically One after 909) because the diologue was taken out.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I love The Beatles but I have to admit that this CD does not add a single thing to their legacy. This CD is more of a vanity project for \\"Sir\\" Paul the Revisionist and guess what...he wins the \\"Let It Be\\" wars because he is the last one alive (I know what you are going to say about Ringo but he doesn't count in any of this). The Let It Be album was probably the weakest album the group recorded as evidenced by the fact that they got back together at the end of the year and recorded a \\"proper\\" album, Abbey Road. There are some good songs amidst this bunch, but between the bickering, close pressured setting, Yoko's presence and John's heroin addiction, the Let It Be / Get Back project was doomed for failure. The concert on the rooftop was probably the most enjoyable thing that came from the entire experiment. For a really good (though outdated) resource on the Get Back sessions then check out the Doug Sulpy Get Back Disaster book. I have had the fortunate experience to wade through hours upon hours of Get Back material and believe me; you can only do so much with the available material. This is not a masterpiece by any means.<br />As for the sound of the album, I believe the sound is very good and the vocals are so clear and crisp it sounds like they are standing next to you when they are singing.  The producers did a good job overall, although Across The Universe still sounds a little too fast and in need of speed correction.  But I also have a problem with the CD. Let It Be...Naked is only 35 minutes long. Along with the 1 track 21-minute \\"fly on the wall\\" bonus disk it totals only 54 minutes. Why is this set 2 CD's? It seems like an awful waste to me. If you have the original then this is not essential.<br />Is it me or does Paul get greedier and cheesier every year? I don't think there is one single artist out there who would not be tempted to fix up some of their older material. But this project is completely out of control with ego.  I am pretty sure John would have liked to fix up some of his songs that he felt were never properly recorded like Strawberry Fields Forever and Across The Universe.  As much as Sir Paul may not like it, the original recordings will stand forever and this version, like the The Threatles recordings before it, will fade into bad memory.<br />Lastly, I did not appreciate the chastising message on the back insert of the disk telling me I do not own the copyright to this music as well as telling me that music piracy hurts the artists who created this music. The last time I checked, Paul McCartney was a billionaire. Give me a break! They actually go so far to say that downloading copyrighted music is akin to stealing the actual CD from a store. What a way to thank their fans!liked to fix up some of his songs that he felt were never properly recorded like Strawberry Fields Forever and Across The Universe.

B000002UJQ|1.0|The last cd this good was Slayers Reign in Blood or Poison's Unskinny Bop. I think I am important because I like this self indulgent drivel.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This CD is unmistakeable evidence of the Beatles magic.  From the first note of 'Get Back' you can hear that this new version has been produced and mixed with great skill and care.  The sound quality is captivating: the voices and instruments are tightly mixed to give you an arresting, immediate experience of the men at work.  If you want to know what is the magic of the Beatles -- the songs or the singers?  the voices or the instruments? -- the production team for this reissue gives you the answer: Yes!  The old journalistic criticisms of this album no longer apply: this is not rehearsal music and it's not the sound of a band past their prime.  Remember, they had not yet started on Abbey Road when these tunes were recorded.  I agree with other reviewers that it's no longer adequate to just give us the original tracks (minus two!).  The Fly On The Wall disc is a poor substitute for the additional songs we expect on a reissue.  But we can't complain about what we've got.  With Phil Spector's horribly misjudged over-production removed and the songs all there for the enjoyment, you can savor every track for its authentic, satisfying Beatles feel.  For fans, there are just too many happy musical moments to list here.  For someone less familiar with the band or this album, you aren't going to be disappointed.   You might have thought of it as Paul's album, as he is the soloist on two of the better known tracks 'The Long and Winding Road' and 'Let It Be'.  But that's not so.  One of the successes of this production is to show us just how good John's rock n roll voice is.  But of course, this is not a recording of distinct individuals but a band as cohesive as you'll hear anywhere.  I particularly liked 'I've Got A Feeling' and 'One After 909' as examples of John and Paul's mastery of their musical art.  After all this rapture I have to mention the one big disappointment: Track 4, 'The Long and Winding Road'.  For me, this track was always the centrepiece of the album, andit was the one I most looked forward to hearing in its original form.  But what we get is below standard.  The vocal is average, and there's a particularly awful keyboard interlude, sounding less like a keyboard than a children's toy.  We've already been given a 'naked' version of this track -- on Anthology 3 -- and I wanted to hear something better; but this isn't it.  Dig out your Anthology 3 set and listen to what this track should have been (Disc 2, Track 8).
B00000JCOV|5.0|Best band ever. Best debut cd ever. best songs : ALL of them
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Oh Britney, Britney, who's trying so hard to change her image and show her &quot;true&quot; self. It's very unfortunate that this album is not as good as her past albums, and lacks the catchiness and melody her other albums have had I also noticed she's following the recent (or popular?) trend of mixing in a Middle Eastern (and Asian) flavor to her songs. Good points for this, but  nothing special in her case.<br /> Me Against the Music, Touch of My Hand, Early Mornin, Breathe On Me and Toxic are the more standout tracks. I really think the song Boom Boom is annoying because the chorus is sampled from another song. Otherwise, it would have worked. Overall, this is a mediocre album with mediocre to boring songs. For those who are curious or interested in buying this album, I recommend you sample it if possible first. Otherwise, I'd say buy Christina Aguilera's album instead.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|As most will agree, the first movie was the better of the two.  The fight scenes here happen simply for the ability to show off the effects.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Michael Jackson is the Best of the Best. This CD has a handful of the most Loved Michael Jackson songs. I am so glad Ive been able to live a lifetime with the enjoyment of his entertainment. I will always love his unique and talented gift - no matter what anyone says about him.<br />xoxo<BR>Roy
B00009TB5G|4.0|Good movie, a little slow in spots (too much running everywhere!), but great visuals as usual.
B00005JM02|5.0|When the theatrical trailer was released, I was not impressed. Luckliy my 6 year old talked me into going. I was not dissappointed.<br />This film is simply captivating with the artwork and visual effects. But the film's most notable attribute is the diverse selection of characters. Ellen deserves an Oscar for her audio work as Dory, the fish with short-term memory.<br />Whether you're a fan of animated films or not, I found this film to be solid overall and I highly reccommend it for all ages.
B00005R8GU|5.0|the results are in....an almost unanimous ***** for this gigantic piece of work which has been in my collection [and in my brain] since 1970.  you should buy it.  but just for the record....it's not the paul butterfield band backing - it's mr. butterfield and mr. bloomfield only of that troupe doing inspired work each....i'm here to tell ya that the cd notes are quite an improvement on the original 2-lp liner notes, which were non-existent....other reviewers have given their favorites, none of which is &quot;long distance call&quot; which is mine [dig the finish]....and also dig the double harp work on &quot;all aboard&quot; [first track] - only work i know of mr. jeff carp, but a fine piece it is....did i mention that you should buy it?
B0000AQVCL|5.0|What can I say? This CD is outstanding, 10 out of 10. The Strokes, saviours of rock and roll? You've gotta be kidding me, these guys are the real deal. A friend recommended I listen to \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" and I'm f*cking glad I did because right from the moment I heard it I loved this band. This isn't the kind of pretentious indie crap that I'm getting tired of reading about in NME, it's just downright good rock music. The kind that you can actually enjoy... the kind you can sing along to. I'm not gonna draw a whole load of comparisons or talk about Jet's influences or whatever, the fact of the matter is this album is bloody good. I'd say if you had to buy one CD this year, make it this one.
B000002UQJ|2.0|'Hope Of Deliverance' and 'Off The Ground' are two okay numbers but the rest are barely memorable or just plain awful, like the unintenionally hilarious 'Biker Like An Icon'. This song is typical of the sort of lazy, uninspired stuff that has helped to steadily erode McCartney's reputation as a songwriter over the past few decades-lyrics that might have looked okay on paper, but they just sound ridiculous and childish when sung out loud. <br />The problem with this album, like so many others he's released, is that the majority of songs shouldn't ever see the light of day from an artist of his calibre. If most of the songs on this album were presented to a record company as a demo by a new artist, it'd more than likely be rejected. <br />There are a couple of tracks here co-written with Elvis Costello, but neither are of the standard of their collaborations featured on the far superior 'Flowers In The Dirt'. These may be from those sessions and it would make sense why they weren't featured on that album...they're just not very good. <br />Skip this and try 'Tug Of War', 'Flowers In The Dirt' and 'Flaming Pie' instead. They are the best solo albums he's made in the past few decades and contain some great tracks.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|While most musicians develop, evolve, and craft their unique talent (or, at the very least, attempt to), Britney takes random pieces of \\"mainstream\\" or \\"popular\\" techniques that other musicians have developed and calls them her own. In The Zone provides the listener with a jumbled mess of desperate styles that Britney had no part in producing, an embarrassingly over-synthesized vocals (is she really such a bad singer that they must do this to her voice? no wonder she never sings live!), and a crowd of sold-out celebrity talent (Moby and Madonna, for example). If you are looking for music that provides a hint of intellectual inspiration, stay far away from this disk. Britney is quite content to talk about herself, thank you, and she sure does think she's quite the queen. In The Zone is about sex, [...], breathing on each other, one-night stands, (how surprising!!!) lost love (apparently Britney still can't stop thinking about Justin, even though it's been years since anyone cared), and of course Britney X10 (not that she has anything very interesting to say about herself). So ya, if you want to fill you brain with over-produced, under-talented tip-of-the-iceberg glance at all that's popular on the corporate-driven MTV, then you may want to consider downloading Britney's fourth album. I would recommend finding something better to do with your energy.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|In his own way, even from beyond the material world, George Harrison once again resets the standards for excellenec in music and film. As was the case with the CONCERT FOR BANGLA DESH, THE CONCERT FOR GEORGE is a work born of tremendous compassion, and if you were to distill George Harrison to one word and say it into the air, you would rightly intone: Compassion.<BR>So, from the opening &quot;Sarve Shaam&quot; with its intenseley deep ochre and crimson overtones through Olivia's lighting the lamp for her husband and Eric Clapton's and then Ravi Shankar's beautifully affecting remarks, you know this is a work of very deep love. And it is shot gorgeously, as it should from the man who produced TIME BANDITS and LIFE OF BRIAN. The classical Indian pieces that open the movie are deeply spiritual pieces that set the context for a man whose life dealt with his devotion to his family, his faith, his craft, his friends. Clapton is positively eloquent as he searches for a way to maintain his composure and find the right words for a friend who espoused a less is more ethic in his work to great effect. Shankar speaks with such profound love that it fills your heart. His daughter Anoushka attends respectfully to her father and then plays her heart out. It is glorious!<BR>Less things get too sentimental, Eric Idle and chums arrive for a bawdy version of both &quot;Sit On My Face&quot; and Michael Palin's hilarious intro to &quot;The Lumberjack Song.&quot;<BR>How else would you segue from Indian ragas to Beatle tunes?<BR>When Dhani Harrison and Jeff Lynne lead the houseband back on, the concert is an incredible celebration of some of Harrison's best compositions. Every guest delivers the goods, but certainly the emotional highpoint is Ringo's &quot;Photograph&quot; and Paul's &quot;Something.&quot; Clapton is incredible throughout. Tom Petty essya the Wilbury's period and Billy Preston breathes revival fervour into &quot;My Sweet Lord.&quot; Dhani is terrific throughout and lendsan eerie presence playing behind Clapton, every bit the countenance of his father beaming through him.<BR>This film is a triumph on so many levels that it is unlikely that rock will ever elevate itself to this level again anytime in the foreseeable future. When it all resolves into Joe Brown's take on &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams,&quot; you realize what a profound proverb the Chinese admonition is: &quot;Money means nothing. To be loved and remembered is everything.&quot;<BR>Farewell, George, we'll see you in our dreams.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is an excellent album with many different defining characteristics. One is the Extra-loud bass on songs like &quot;The Package&quot;. This album is not for those who were looking for the dark and heavy stuff that Tool provides. this is a fabricated opus with rock music with ambient soundscapes mixed in. I enjoyed this music since most of the lyrics are very light-hearted. This is a album which is worth the money to buy it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|There are two reasons I would recommend this:<BR>1.New versions of songs<BR>2. and more importantly, EXCELLANT SOUND QUALITY<br />I'm an 18 year old who picked up at taste from the Beatles from my father.  I never really got into Let It Be because my dad never owned the album.  I eventually copied the CD from my uncle and I wasn't a big fan.  This album changed my mind.  This is an incredible remaster, and sounds much better than any other Beatles material ever released.  I hope they do this to all the albums in the future.  I bought the CD to get the experience of buying a &quot;new&quot; Beatles CD, and I don't regret it one bit.<br />As for Paul betraying John, just remember that this was Paul's project and attempt to keep the Beatles together.  The Long and Winding Road was a song that Paul wrote, so I believe he had the right to change it.  John's stuff was left nearly the same, save Across the Universe which sounds worlds better than the old version (slowing down a song degrades the quality, which is what was done on Specter's version).  The new album even added one of John's songs: Don't Let Me Down.  Also, if you look on the inside of the cover, songwriting credits go to Lennon/McCartney.  If anything, Paul has done the Beatles a favor by preserving their work in a much better and more presentable form, free of tape hiss and washed out sounds found in previous dated releases.<br />It's a great CD, especially if you don't own Let It Be or appreciated a perfectly mastered CD that brings the band right into your living room.  I just hope every Beatles CD gets a similar treatment soon, as far as remixing the masters to achieve results similar to this.  I know all those old tapes have the potential!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Most people are very skeptical of Britney Spears, but I find this record to be a very enjoyable experience. I think that you can hear the time and effort pur forth in making this record and It all pays off. The first single &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; doesnt show all the album has to offer. I admit i do like that song but there is much better on this album:<BR>Me Against the Music- 8/10 this song is perfect for clubbing and just fhaving fun but there is so much more to be heard.<br />(I got that) boom boom- 9/10 HOT!HOT!HOT! The beat on this song is so sick, and I just have to say that it was a very bold and wise move to work  with the ying yang twins.<br />Early Morning- 9/10 This song really describes a nightout for me, going to the clubs dancing with tons of people and getting plastered, then feeling the punishment the next day! DAMN THE HANGOVER!!!!<br />Breathe on me- 10/10 I love this whole techno trippy sound that she has going on in this song. This really has a mature vibe and I love this spng with a passion!!!<br />Showdown-8/10 I really like this song just because it really makes me happy. i dont why, it just does.<br />Toxic-10/10 This song is so perfect and I love the way it starts off and its very unique and diffrent the vocal arrangement is crazt and makes the song so much cooler.<br />Outragous- 8/10 With in the first 5 seconds of hearing this song you know its produced by R.Kelly. Its really eastern and kind of generic in the direction hip-hop is going in right now.<br />Touch of my hand- *100* OH MY GOD!!!!! This is my favorite song ever it just has something. I dont know what it is about the song but it just takes me to another level.<br />The Hook Up-10/10- Great Reggae/Dancehall song, it has all the right elements for a hit and it doesnt hurt that it practiclly forces you to get your ass up and dance.<br />Shadow-8/10 This track produced by THE MATRIX is really cool and breathy and i could see a very uplifting video along with it.<br />BraveGirl- 9/10 This song is the most reminiscent of her past albums and its a good song and very bouncy and happy, but the beat still has that trippy techno feel to it<br />Everytime- 8/10 The single Ballad on the album is really cool and haunting. It really sheds some light on the Justin/Britney situation without being mean and slandering the other.<br />Me Against the Music Remix 10/10-Crazy! That fully describes this song, i really cant say more about it.<br />This a great CD that I recomend that everyone gets and most likely if you do you will love it. I know that I dont have to flip around the cd to find songs i love them all, and thats really hard to find these days. Either songs are to serious or to happy, this album has just the right blend.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is probably the greatest album ever recorded. Abbey road was the lasty beatles cd recorded although let it be was released later. this album shows the creativity and inginuity of The greatest rock band of all time. Abbey Raod made bands like queen, kansas, and even led zeppelin possible. this CD revolutionized music more than any other album ever has. It is the Beatles at their best and will always be labeled as one of the greatest albums ever
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Alright, I've been doing alot of reading about this set through discussion forums and online reviews (a good one at thedigitalbits.com)  and I have to comment on people who are knocking this set already.<br />1.  The packaging - okay so it folds out to over 5 feet when completely unfolded.  So what!  You are not going to fold it out both ways anyway.  If you really care that much be creative and come up with your own solution and store the foldout somewhere.<br />2.  The 30 minute cut of Alien3 features - So there was a 30 minute cut of the features on Alien3 and now some people aren't happy.  You guys need to get a life.  98% of the population doesn't care including myself.  There are plenty of other features to keep you busy.<br />$70 is a steal for this set and you all should be thankful that such a thorough set is being released.  Count your blessings folks, this is one set that will be hard to imitate.
B00009TB5G|5.0|After my great experience with &quot;The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)&quot;, I didn't hesitate a minute with the extended release of the two towers.  Great stuff!<br />Again, I wonder why they just didn't show this version in the theaters?  Not really that much longer than the original and much more entertaining and clear.  Closer to the book in a variety of ways and for you Gollum lovers there's a lot more of the slimy little creature with all of his enduring qualities.<br />The four-disc set is also packed with extra features up the ying-yang.  And don't viewing everything until you've found the hidden extra feature hosted by Peter Jackson himself.  That's all I'm saying. <br />A must for every serious LOTR fan. <br />Douglas McAllister
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears...what can u say about this woman...not much of a vocalist but a good performer to say the least..I didnt become a fan of her until SLAVE FOR YOU came out...I mean I liked all her singles but the rest of the first to albums were all filler...Britney was a 5 star album not one bad song on it..even her voice had seemed to gain some strength...<br /> Now this cd came out I loved the whole Britney and Madonna thing so I bought this album the day it came out right away I fell Inlove with the songs,  I GOT THAT BOOM BOOM, SHOWDOWN, SHADOW, and EVERYTIME...After a few listens all the others except 2 grew on me...Britney seems to have lost alot vocally maybe she should quit drinking and smoking for her voice..i mean shes grown and can do what she wants but still its not good for her...<br />the only thing that will annoy me about her at this point is the fact every song as a sexual line or messege to it and nop one seems to be complaining where as xtinas STRIPPED only had 2 songs with anything sexual and she gets ripped apart..haters all of you...<br />anyway im not gonna lie i love this album and i loved her last one I think if you want Britney at her best then get her self titled album but this is good to go along with it or if you already have it get this one its wqorth the money and has hot tracks mostyly dance with one beautiful ballad...<br />1.

B000089CJI|5.0|Bought it, then listened to it a few times... The album is so good that I dont want to burn-out any of it's songs. Although some tracks have bad-memories-attached I refuse to stop listening to it for I am willing to create new history with it. So I listen precariously. &quot;Nothing Better&quot; Describes a man's broken heart and willingness to try an impossible relationship again...but life is no fairytale let's not forget nothing is. ( I relate to that aspect ) Such Great Heights = Brilliant. :) Thank you.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|This album, in alot of ways, feels almost like a Volume 2 to last year's &quot;Heathen&quot;... and being as how that was a great album, this one is two.  Crisp and fresh sounding, much of &quot;Heathen&quot;'s sadness is replaced here with a new hope and outlook.  The very best track is Bowie's tribute to George Harrison, &quot;Try Some Buy Some&quot;.  One of Harrison's lesser known tracks, Bowie's version is breathtaking, and is enough in itself to make this album worth having.  Rock on David!
0060977493|5.0|With her &quot;The God of Small Things&quot;, Roy has clearly established herself as one of the great writers of our time.  Her compassion, creativity, and great imagination come out on nearly every page.  I endorse this book wholeheartedly and it surely deserves every award it has received with more to come! Definitely one not to be missed!
B000065V1V|5.0|The sticker on the CD cover is absolutely right... this is truly &quot;Classic David Bowie, Circa 2002&quot;.  Probably the best album Bowie has done since the 1980's, this is a must have for anybody who even remotely likes David Bowie.  While exploring new sounds and not allowing himself to become glued to any particular style, this album nonetheless has all the works we've come to know and love about Bowie.  &quot;Slow Burn&quot; is probably the best track, but every song on here is worth hearing.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|Apparently, Pink Floyd should have renamed themselves the Nick Mason Band because the director was certainly infatuated with the drummer!!!  Occasionally we get a passing glance (and I mean &quot;passing&quot;, because the camera moves right past them) at Gilmour, Waters, and Wright(about all we see of Wright is an extreme close up of his hands in the closing part of &quot;Echoes&quot;).  This was frustating, because the Meddle album was one of my favorites. Except for a brief Dark Side of the Moon session, this baby is for friends of the director only.
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|On an interview, lead singer, Julien Casablnca revealed that the Strokes second studio lp, Room on Fire, was driven by a fear of failure.  This statement speaks with an incredible honesty to the sound of the record itself.  With very good reason, when they came out with &quot;Is This It?&quot; the Strokes were critically acclaimed, perhaps more than anyone else as, as the best new rock group to come about in a long time.  In order to appease their critacal aclaim, as well as their rabid fan base, the Strokes had to deliver a second album which followed largely in the footsteps of its predecessor; A solid collection of simple rock songs, following a similar formula to &quot;Is This It.&quot;  This is exactly what the guys did with &quot;Room On Fire.&quot;<br />On the weak points: The album sounds far less original and captivating as the first.  Rather than adding new dimensions to the band &quot;Room on Fire&quot; often ends up sounding like a collection of B-Sides to &quot;Is This It&quot; The song that most sounds like it is breaking across new ground for the band is ironically, the single, 12:51.  The mix tends to at times get a little too &quot;crazy lo-fi.&quot;  Though the &quot;Lo-Fi sound&quot; is a trademark signature of the band, it sounds like the band or producers are trying too hard to get a certain sound. (The beginning, and main riff to &quot;The Way It Is&quot; sounds like a Nu-Metal song which never gets its feet off the ground and into &quot;Hi-Fi&quot;) Their performances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien actually have a much better sounding mix than the record.... and that is coming live from crappy speakers on a 19 inch television. Overall I think the band gets caught up too heavily on trying to sound a certain way on the recording and the tracks get somewhat sterilized, not being able to fufill much of their full potential as solid rock tracks.<br />On the strong points:  This is far from a real dissapointment.  Maybe a little bit of a let down,but it would be hard for any band to follow up an album as strong as &quot;Is This It.&quot;  The overall album is still an excellent peice of work, as well as a fresh breath of air in these dwindling times of mainstream rock.  The Stokes sound like what a real, proper, rock band should sound like.  Not making guitar distortion as a kind of refinement (Hence all the Metal groups with the low mids on their Mesa Boogie Rectifiers)the Strokes keep the sound of Rock and Roll as it should be; Raw, Pure, and Unmolested. They are all about the music, and don't give a damn about image, even if they look cool as hell.  The singer stills stares blankly and borishly out at the crowd, which is almost humourous.  It spits in the face of all else mainstream, from the pop dancers moving in prastic synchrony, to the Nu-Metal bands foolishly jumping around the stage as if they had just crapped their own pants.  The Strokes are a treasure that is here to stay.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I am proud to say that I am an extreme Beatles fanatic, have attempted to collect every work of theirs available, British, American, Russian, Japanese, etc., including the rarities, bootlegs, outtakes, sessions, and have always loved the rootsy, drunken &quot;Get Back&quot; Sessions the best, with &quot;Commonwealth,&quot; &quot;Suzy's Parlour,&quot; &quot;In the Middle of an Island&quot; and &quot;Take This Hammer,&quot; just to name a few of the boys' beloved underground classics (not to mention all those bluesy jams with Billy Preston).  Sadly for you, you won't hear any of that on this album.  <br />I have been waiting for the real &quot;Get Back&quot; to be released since the early 70's, when I first learned that Phil Spector had allegedly mucked up what was supposed to be a very earthy back-to-basics hippyfied r&amp;b oldies jam, and hoping that I didn't die before I got to hear it.  The famous &quot;Black Album&quot; bootleg and the more recent &quot;Thirty Days&quot; bootleg kept my hopes alive in the intervening decades.  This &quot;Naked&quot; album is not that dream come true; it is a bitter disappointment.  <br />The song &quot;Get back&quot; is mutilated.  Where is the &quot;hope we passed the audition&quot; bit, the &quot;high heeled sneakers and low neck sweater&quot; bit, the reprise?  What a headache any true fan is sure to get hearing Get Back jar right into &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; without time to take a breath.  That part alone causes one to suspect that the Beatles did not listen to this record carefully before approving its release.    Why did they not include the whole &quot;Dig It&quot; (of which some of the cut out portions were better than what was released)?  Poor old Maggie Mae; they really have taken her away; and she'll never walk our night streets anymore.  Why did they not include &quot;Maggie Mae,&quot; with the charming little &quot;Fancy Me Chances&quot; ditty at the end?  <br />Winston O'Boogie is right; what the world needs now ismore Beatles music, not less!  I suppose one could jerry rig a proper &quot;Get Back&quot; album by burning together bits from Anthology 3, the bootlegs, the original album, this album and the &quot;Let It Be&quot; movie (if only it were easy to get the &quot;Let It Be&quot; movie on DVD anywhere outside the former Soviet bloc), but that would be illegal.  Even an audio track of the movie itself would be much better than this new album.  At least there you'll find a little version of &quot;You've really got a hold on me&quot; that will put a smile on your face.  <br />If anyone has the chance to listen to the actual &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions, copies of which are still floating around out there, or Vigotone's &quot;Thirty Days,&quot; or the &quot;Glynn Johns Mixes&quot; of the &quot;Get Back&quot; album, or Yellow Dog's &quot;Get Back and 22 Other Songs&quot;, I would recommend that they do so.  If you can tolerate a few botched notes or words here or there, you're in for a treat.  The &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions contain many diamonds in the rough, none of which made it onto the &quot;Naked&quot; disc.  <br />The &quot;Naked&quot; record is a ripoff, which I give two stars only because I also cannot give the Beatles the lowest score on anything, even if I am disappointed that they would allow their name to be attached to such a rip off.  <br />Those who are only infants today may be able to hope that one day, in their elder years (assuming that advances in medicine extend the average life expectancy by a few decades and that Congress doesn't squeeze through another sweetheart copyright extension for the industry at the expense of the public), they'll be able to listen to the real thing in the public domain without fear of persecution by EMI and the RIAA.  Until then, fans are still at the mercy of the monopolists, and will have to settle for second rate releases like this one. It is worse than Phil Spector's version (something I would have had trouble imaginingbefore today).<br />Those who say that the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album (at least an idealized version of the same) is not excellent do not have any appreciation for rock &amp; roll music.  It should have been one of the best albums in rock history, especially with &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;, &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; and &quot;One After 909,&quot; three gritty masterpieces that earn the fab four a place, with the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers, up in the Honky Tonk Valhalla.  However, this &quot;Naked&quot; version does not bring us any closer to the true eidos (Platonic form) of the new-phase Beatle album promised all those years ago.  Alas, we true &quot;Get Back&quot; fans must continue to lament, in the words of the Walrus, &quot;don't keep me waitin' . . .&quot;<br />Sorry, Paul and Ringo, I didn't want to have to feel this way about one of your records; you just got my hopes up and let them down.  <br />Fans, Beware!!!  The Emperor has no clothes!!!!!!!
B000002NZO|5.0|Following a major debut slump album that lacked good production, good publicity and even a good name (called &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot; it got stored alongside religious albums in many record stores), in 1970 Genesis recorded what would be known as the true beginning of their prog rock sound.<br />While the lineup differed slightly from the 'classic' Genesis we got used to between 1971 and 1975 (Phil Collins still wasn't a part of the band, and neither was Steve Hackett, whose place was occupied by the brilliant guitarrist Anthony Phillips), the core of the band's seminal sound was already present, with Tony Banks' keys complementing the 'pastoral' (for lack of a better term) guitars of Mike Rutherford and Phillips in a very edgy way, and with Peter Gabriel singing and hovering with his flute over all the instruments like a maestro.<br />Songs to pick? Quite a challenge, indeed. The biggest song to come out of this album (in more than one sense) was clearly &quot;The Knife&quot;, a song in a Bolero (by Ravel) rhythm, that could have easily been picked to coin what the term progressive rock sounded like: strong, lyrical and rhythmical filled with passion to the bones, with keys and guitars giving the song an almost orchestral-like life. But the track that gave the cover its reason for being (flip the cover, so that you can see what I mean) is far from being the only valuable song in the album: &quot;White Mountain&quot; and &quot;Visions of Angels&quot; were a regular part of the band's live repertoire before the time came for more elaborate works, such as Foxtrot's &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; or the concept work &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;. &quot;Stagnation&quot; and &quot;Dusk&quot; are also equally bound to make you rejoice at the quality of the early work of a band of young brilliant musicians in their early twenties, in the beginning of a musical movement whose bulk would take the bigger part of the early seventies.<br />After listening to the album for the first time, if it's (hopefully) your first time listening to &quot;old&quot; Genesis, the good news is that there's plenty more that can be found where this majestic work of art comes from, to satisfy even the most curious of musical souls. If you go chronologically through the band's work, you are bound to encounter extremely enriching musical works up to 1977's 'And Then There Were Three' (the album following the departure of guitarrist Steve Hackett). Past that point, you gotta watch your step, because you're bound to find all sorts of things, ranging from brilliant (some of the tracks in 'Duke' are, for example, as well as most of 'We Can't Dance', the last album with Phil Collins) to sheer mediocre (most of the albums posthumous work are worth about 1 star).g to the album for the first time, if it's (hopefully) your first time listening to &quot;old&quot; Genesis, the good news is that there's plenty more that can be found where this majestic work of art comes from, to satisfy even the most curious of musical souls.

B0000DJZA5|3.0|all the songs on let it be were always good songs. ive had many bootlegs over the years of outtakes from these sessions and if you listened to them you heard that there really werent that many perfect takes of anything. the original Ive got a feeling, Dig a pony, and One after 909 were all from the rooftop.These songs were not overproduced at all by Phil Spector. on this cd i was hoping for the real rooftop version of Dig a pony with the &quot;all i want is&quot; beginning but they didnt put it on here. One after 909 is basically the same except after Lennon sings &quot;run right home&quot; paul doesnt answer back. Ive got a feeling is some sort of cut up edited version of different takes,[some from rooftop and some from studio]. obviously this isnt a &quot;naked version&quot;. Across the universe isnt even from the Let it be sessions and dates back to 1 year earlier. This version of the song Let it be starts off the same as the single version but once the guitar solo comes in its a different take. I dont know why they did all this splicing of different takes. I think they want you to belive that the Beatles were at the top of their game at these sessions and there were perfect takes of these songs. Believe me after hearing all the bootleg stuff and watching the movie you know they really werent into it that much , so in the long run the best version of these songs really were on the original album.Also what they did on here was whenever someone was not singing close to the microphone for whatever reason, they decided to raise the volume of it on here, so that wasnt really necessary i think.to me thats not raw like its supposed to sound. I know this review is coming off bad but i already had good versions of these songs between the original album and anthology, which contains a great I me mine and Long and winding road. There never really was a perfect recorded version of Dont let me down, so like the original version ,this one is another spliced and edited version.Overall i have to say that if you are not a huge fan and never heard the bootleg and anthology versions then i guess this will be cool for you, but being a Beatle fanatic like me, this is nothing i havent heard before. the extra disc contains some stuff i ve never heard before but kind of makes it sound like it was all fun at these sessions when it was the most miserable of all Beatle recordings.
B000000HRP|5.0|Life is not without ironies and this album confirms again one of rock's most interesting ones. As if his work with Genesis were not proof enough of his musical talent, Phil Collins' drumming in this album is bound to leave most drummers and non-drumming music fans speechless, as he glides through the tracks of this album by Brand X, his side project in the late seventies.<br />One could think that something just went terribly wrong with Phil, causing him to throw his musical creativity down a deep hole when the eighties kicked in, and throw himself in the hands of commercial pop and musical recycling for a very long embrace that sadly lasts to this day. In any case, there's plenty of musical testimonies to what his musical genius was for a good decade and so, and his works with Brand X is one of them.<br />Brand X is the brainchild of Phil Collins and Atomic Rooster's guitarist John Goodsall (same band where Emerson Lake and Palmer's Carl Palmer came), and in spite of what you'd be inclined to think, their contributions were not the only brilliant moments of this -by most considered their best- album. 'Unorthodox Behaviour' bridges the gap between jazz fusion and prog rock in a way that is unbelievable, walking a fine line (invisible, some might argue) without tumbling, and maintaining a cohesive and well crafted sound that gives the album a well deserved five stars.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|I bought it today, I can't let something that has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt keep me from the songs that I grew up loving. I can't tell you to buy it or not, but the songs are crisp and clear and It's a good CD for the price.
B000002H97|5.0|With Classics such as Dont Tread On Me, My Friend Misery, Nothing Else Matters, and Sad But True this is a must have album. Its been out for a while so its nice and cheap and delivers what it promises another great Metallica CD. Buy This and many others. Metallica lives on!
B00005JM0B|2.0|I'd heard this one was bad, but I wanted to see some explosions and and car chases.  If that's all you want, this movie is worth seeing, otherwise, forget it.  The script stinks, filled with stupid throwbacks to the previous movies and silly situations.  The acting stinks (if anything, Arnold's gotten worse since T2, and he's certainly looking older.  Do Terminator's really age?).  The characters are inane (who really cares about these versions of the characters).  The worst thing is that this movies isn't even bad in a good way.  Some movies are so bad you can laugh at them.  This one, sorry, it's not even funny.  Just kinda dull.<br />The interesting stuff in this series has already been said.  Go watch T2 again.  Leave this turkey on the shelf where it belongs.
067101756X|3.0|The late Philip Corso tells the story of how he came into possession of top secret files and alien artifacts from the crash at Roswell in 1947. He was told by his commanding officer to &quot;see what you can do&quot; with the alien technology. He goes on to say how he set it up so that the technology would be fed to the public little by little so the public wouldn't suspect anything amiss. According to him this is where most of our modern technology came from including the transistor radio. Interesting book but slow paced.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|This was not one of the better movies of the year.  The storyline seemed forced and gimmicky.  It seemed as if the Wachowski brothers were concentrating too much on making more money rather than giving depth to the storyline.  Some parts of the movie were just plain stupid.  For example, the entire Zion scene was very close to being pointless.  Morpheus announces that robots are coming that way to destroy them and then everyone starts partying....Is it just me, or was something missing there.  Did these people want to die by the Sentinels, because when they heard they were coming that way, they sure started celebrating.  Also, the sex scene with Neo and Trinity was pointless.  It was informant to the few audience members who were still naive to the fact that they were in love while stating the obvious to the rest of the crowd.  They conveyed Neo and Trinity as being so in love that everytime they see each other, they had to kiss and make out.  Is it just me, or were the Wachowski brothers trying to cater to the teenage audience with this scene.  It seems as if their hormones are still raging and they have the curiousity of a 4th grader.  If that part of the story had any use at all, then I have no idea what it was for.<BR>The action in this story was alright.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst this world had seen, either.  On a comparison between all three of the movies, this one would rank number two, behind the original, yet ahead of the final one.<BR>Even though this movie is mainly made up of a filler plot, it is vital to see in order to comprehend the series.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I was pleasantly suprised by this performance. Shania is one of my favorite artists and this performance just confirms what a great artist she is. She performs all the songs you want to hear and many more.Her voice is even better when she performs live and this is no exception. This is a must have for any Shania fan. Buy it.
B000002552|5.0|For years (1966-75 to be exact), \\"The Basement Tapes\\" were legendary for being both an alluring rumor, and an often bootlegged item. When it was finally released officially nine years after its birth, it served as an essential historical document of the musical bridge that connected (one) the winding down of Bob Dylan's brilliant folk work as he traded it for rocker status and (two) The Band's uncontainable talent ready to explode.<br />The twenty-four gems that comprise \\"The Basement Tapes\\" are trademark Dylan-Band, painting a unique portrait of rural life in Southern creoles, and intriguing Biblical metaphors. Dylan's wordplay and storytelling are well served on numbers like 'Lo and Behold!', 'Clothes Line Saga,' 'Million Dollar Bash,' and 'Tiny Montgomery,' while patches of rock and melancholia present themselves throughout, such as the depression 'Goin' To Acapulco' and the 60s-rock of 'Odds and Ends.' The Band meanwhile assert themselves as the greatest backing band (their status for the time being) that ever lived, and proved they were destined to become just as important as Bob Dylan, shining on compositions that would become Band favorites like 'Tears Of Rage,' 'Yazoo Street Scandal,' 'Bessie Smith,' and 'This Wheel's On Fire.'<br />This double disc document is given the proper CD treatment, and of course for an album recorded in a basement in Big Pink (The Band's house at that time), the remastered polish has its limits, but the rough recording is part of the charm of \\"The Basement Tapes\\"--no matter the less than perfect recording, the album boasts some of the most wonderful compositions and musicianship of the era.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I loved this movie (as well as its sequel) I felt that  a lot of the criticisms for the film are unjustufied (moreso for Revolutions, whose critical failure is an absolute joke). But anyways moving on the film. The first hour of the film may seem to drag for some (Rave scene, shouldve been edited down at the least, most notably), but after that its a nonstop thrill ride (sorry for the clished description) Neos fight against the merovingians denizens was incredibly well done, surpassing every fight in the original, in my opinion, the highway chase was such a visceral pulse pounding experience I will be never be bored of this scene, Neos meeting with the architect (which seemingly left a lot of people perplexed) was definately an interesting twist in the story, even the burly brawl despite its flawed CGi was an incredible action piece, which indeed did serve a purpose I might add. Overall this film will definately get repeat viewing until Revolutions gets the DVD treatment and the rumored Trilogy boxset is released! With this trilogy, the Wachowski brothers have tried to make a different kind of cinema, in most ways they have succeeded, and I do believe that in the long run (like most classic science fiction) this series will seen in a very positive light. If youve been put off seing this movie because of some of the negative response, do youreself a favor and check it out, if you dont pay attention to the hype and undeserving backlash, you may end up pleasantly surprised.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This dvd comes with a widescreen directors cut and the original short 4:3 film.<br />The film was originally released on video years ago as a long version and a short version.  Until now, I'd never seen the short version so maybe it was only released in Europe.  The short feature doesn't have any interviews with the band or shots of the band recording dark side of the moon.  And the long version (not included here and probably the one you rented from your local video store years ago) was intercut with all the extra scenes.<br />The included directors cut is similiar to the original long version but has been rebuilt from ground up. It contains all the original scenes, interviews plus lots of weird scenes of moons revolving around strange planets, space ships taking off, plus new footage of Pompeii, etc.<br />Most people have never seen the original short or the directors cut.  And like a lot of purists here I watched the original short verson first and of course my first observation was the lack of scenes like Nick Mason complaining about the crust on his apple pie. I didn't mind the lack of interviews and such, and frankly, the original short plays just great the way it is. It sticks to the Pompeii theme and I like that a lot.<br />As a bonus the directors cut also includes some extra interviews which have never been previously released.  There is one very funny scene of a very stoned Roger Waters giving the director a very hard time during an interview.  It also contains new footage of Pompeii plus lots of scenes of space ships taking off, and moons revolving around strange alien planets.  It's kinda weird and you may not like it much at first, but it certainly grows on you and it was all done very well.<br />So my advice would be, if you're a purist, stick to the original short and then simply skip through the directors cut to see the interviews and studio scenes.<br />And also, the sound quality is just fantastic and the video quality will just blow your socks off.  It's just that good. It's amazing considering the original negatives have all been lost. And last but not least, the director Adrian Maben interview is also very interesting.  All and all, the entire package is simply fantastic and for the price of about $16, you'd have to be crazy not to get one.f.  It's just that good.

B000002H33|5.0|What can I say?  This is arguably the greatest metal cd ever conceived.  A must have for any metalhead.  With such classic songs as Battery, Master Of Puppets, Sanitarium, and Leper Messiah, +4 more.  This 8 track masterpiece will never disappoint the real metal lover.
B000000XCH|5.0|If there weren't so many great CCR albums, it would be easy to call this one their best.  Certainly 'Bayou Country', 'Green River', and even 'Willie and the Poor Boys' can be considered their most outstanding record, given minor variations in taste.  I suppose my personal favorite is 'Bayou Country', due to a 14 year-old's nostalgic connection to 'Born On the Bayou', and (as a Detroiter) a love for their great cover of (native Detroiter) Mitch Ryder's hit, 'Good Golly Miss Molly'.<br />Yet it's hard to argue against 'Cosmo's Factory', as it features so many top hits.  'Who'll Stop the Rain' didn't stop scaling the national charts until it hit number one, and 'Travelin' Band' and 'Lookin' Out My Back Door' both peaked at number two.  Even the 'b-sides', appearing on this album, 'Run Through the Jungle' and 'Up Around the Bend' received significant airtime.<br />And none of those are even close to being the best song on the album!<br />That distinction would lie with one of the greatest covers of all time, Creedence's version of 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine', all 665 seconds of it (good thing there wasn't one more second in there!).  While this California band most often projects a southern-rock veneer, 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine' exudes a rhythm that makes you swear you're in the midst of an Indian war dance.  The sound is nothing less than pure genius.  John Fogerty's vocals are gripping, and his lengthy guitar solo's are intoxicating.  Creedence is a great cover band, so much so that most of their covers easily transcend the original versions.  'Cosmo's Factory' includes three other fine covers, 'Ooby Dooby', 'Before You Accuse Me', and 'My Baby Left Me'.  But Marvin Gaye may as well have signed over his 'Grapevine' rights to John Fogerty and CCR... it's that good.<br />Add to these highlights the appropriate closer, 'Long As I Can See the Light' (\\"Put a candle in the window...\\"), and the opener, a seven minute rambling rocker called 'Ramble Tamble', and you have one of the finest albums of the early 1970's.

B0000C3I6U|4.0|I am not a fan of bodybuilding or documentaries that ramble about how devastatingly hard it is to stay fit (I remember when the old video was $9.99). But hey, this film has Schwarzenegger, and in the extras you can hear him use all sorts of foul language! Some scenes in this film made me laugh so hard I nearly teared up (Arnold discussing his &quot;wrong advices&quot; and Lou's slow but poignant attempt to keep up with the competition), but at times it is a serious valedictory of people who devote their lives and time to getting their bodies looking the best that they can appear. One feels sorry for Lou at times (he's a heck of a bodybuilder but you just feel he needs a good friend) and Arnold is just so GOOD at running other people down by believing he has a grasp on everyone! No wonder he defeated the Predator and T-1000! He bulls****ed them to death! Watching folks build their bodies is almost like sitting through a rock concert or a family reunion, but don't think that this movie is not an enjoyable and interesting experience.
B000000OU0|2.0|In 1993 or so, I went to see Don Henley in concert and he spoke of new songs he was writing for an Eagles album.  This, of course, got me really excited - I hadn't really discovered the Eagles 'til I was in High School (junior year or so - late 1985/early 1986).  I loved all their studio albums (1972 - 1980) and their live album from 1980 and this announcement from Don Henley got me craving new Eagles music.<br />Maybe it was because my anticipation was so high that this live album, &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;, is so disappointing to me.  Yes, indeed, there were four new songs, but to me, they are pretty lackluster efforts compared with almost anything one finds on the Eagles' studio albums from the 1970s...&quot;Get Over It&quot; is an upbeat song, but it is, to this listener at least, pretty dull.  The only of the other new songs of note is the Timothy B. Schmit penned (I think...)  &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot;, which is quite pretty, but which is also not particularly exciting...<br />As for the live songs, the only song here that really stands out is the terrific acoustic version of &quot;Hotel California&quot;...The beautiful Spanish guitar picking and the lovely harmonies of the song make this album almost worth owning...The rest of the set is somewhat subdued in tone - the only one that rocks out is &quot;Life In The Fast Lane&quot;, and this version is really not much different than their studio version or the one you hear in their 1980 live album...&quot;Take It Easy&quot; is one of my favorite songs of all time and it was nice to hear them singing this one again, but once more, it was not very different from the original...and that's the way it seemed with most of the Eagles songs here (Don Henley's &quot;New York Minute&quot; is also done here...) - in other words, they seem rather superfluous when taken in context with their studio and previous live output.<br />Oh people, I'm sorry to have to give this such a lousy review...I wanted so much tolike this album - I rushed right out to get it, but when all was said and done, it was a real disappointment...I suppose I would recommend this only to the Eagles completist (of which I am one) and also possibly to those interested in the great &quot;Hotel California&quot; performance found here...Note that these are good songs and they are well played,  but the songs chosen are not really among my favorite Eagles hits and the new songs just don't cut it...I give this album 2.25 stars and I'll round down to 2...SADLY, NOT RECOMMENDED...

I like Brooklyn's song, a fresh female vocalist.<br />I bought the deluxe version thinking that there would be videos and interviews, possibly a DVD - but it turned out to be only a download of &quot;The Eminem Desksite&quot; which delivers videos and interviews from the internet, maybe twice a month - but it's FREE to download from [...] and I already had it, so I was rather disappointed!<br />As to the soundtrack itself, I just want to say that, in contrast to most reviewers, I LIKE &quot;The Time of My Life&quot;.  It took a while to get used to it, but since this isn't a RAP ALBUM, but is music connected to a film, I think the song fits as part of the story, when you listen to the lyrics.  I also like &quot;Wasting My Time&quot; by Taryn Manning, who played Jimmy's ex-girlfriend Janine in the movie.  She has a good voice, and her song also makes the soundtrack feel like it's telling a story.  But of course the highlights are the 5 raps in which Eminem appears.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let It Be... Naked came with a great deal of anticipation. We've all grown up with the original Spectorized version and, prior to Naked's release, many expected a radically different cd. Well, it's halfway there. The Abbey Road folks did do an incredible job in improving the overall sound of the recording. Let it Be and The Long And Winding Road almost sound like entirely different recordings and, I think in the case of TLAWR, possibly an alternate take. For me the standout track in terms of improvement is Across The Universe. All of the instrumentation literally leaps to the forefront while some, such as George's sitar, are apparent, at least for me, for the first time. The remaining tracks are solid but without such a radically different sound. The accompanying Fly On The Wall disc is really for completist fans only. Snippets of conversation and a few early run throughs of songs barely held my interest and probably won't be played again. The primary disc while a great improvement, won't place it above some of the more superior Beatles releases such as Sgt. Pepper, The White Album or Abbey Road.
B00000DCH9|5.0|Back in the summer of 1979, before I knew anything of pop music aside from The Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel, I went to a sleepaway camp where someone in my bunk had this great album.  I didn't know who it was, but I loved these great songs - Piano Man, the song about Billy the Kid.  By 1985, I was getting heavily into music...and of course, being from Long Island, Billy Joel was required listening.  In my effort to find music by this guy that my friends were listening to (and who I knew from the radio from songs like \\"Pressure\\", \\"Allentown\\" and \\"Tell Her About It\\"), I went sifting through my dad's record collection.  I found several there...Trying to go in chronological order, the earliest one I found was \\"Piano Man\\".   When I saw the track listing, I realized that this was that great album that we used to listen to in summer camp.<br />It wasn't long before I became intimately familiar with all the songs on this album.  Nowadays, I don't listen much to Billy Joel (probably because I listened to so much of him during High School), but looking at \\"Piano Man\\" in the context of his other work as well as my exposure to much more and different and varied music over the years, I still feel that this is a really good album from someone who would emerge as one of the premier songwriters of the '70s and '80s.<br />Highlights of this album include the poignant, expressive title track which paints a vivid picture of Billy Joel's experience as a lounge pianist (I believe in L.A.).  He paints great characters in this song which, in itself would make the song really good - of course, then there's the great music of the song.  \\"Captain Jack\\" was another great hit off of this album - an ode to the hopelessness of suburban teenagerdom...Other great songs found here include the rollicking western style \\"The Ballad of Billy The Kid\\", the pretty \\"Your My Home\\" (which my friends used as their wedding first dance song), and two very catchy, lesser-known songs \\"Worse Comes To Worst\\" and\\"Ain't No Crime\\".  Also, \\"Stop In Nevada\\" is a very pretty song which, for me, for reasons other than the just the song title, evokes images of the expanses of the American West...Same thing with \\"Billy The Kid\\", except with that song, the song really does have a western flavor.<br />To sum up, there are two songs here which, as individual songs (\\"Ballad of Billy The  Kid\\" and the title track)are masterpieces when standing alone.  The rest of the songs here range from good to very good.  While not a masterpiece as a whole, it is a very good album - I would give it 4 1/2 stars (to get above this, really every song has to be classic material) and round up to 5 stars...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|...this CD would have made me one. She keeps getting better and this CD rocks. The songs are really good. A lot of people would be suprised that they actually like a Britney song, well get prepared because your about to like a whole slew of them. I listened to the whole CD and I can honestly say I like all of the songs. Britney sure knows what she's doing and she's doing it well...really well. Even if you think you don't like Britney, listen to a couple of clips from this album. I'm sure you'll change your mind, even if you don't tell anyone. :) I'm not going to go through each song but this album has a dance, urban vibe to it. Some highlights are Breathe on Me, Touch of My Hand &amp; (I've got that) Boom Boom, the Ying Yang Twins are awesome on this track. No bubblegum pop, even the ballads(Shadow &amp; Everytime)are good. Buy this CD, give it a chance, if you don't like it...you can sell it but I doubt you will. I bought the UK version also, which has 2 bonus tracks including the P. Diddy song, The Answer. They are both pretty hot too.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Don't read long winded reviews.  This is about music and a memory.  All of the numbers are covers that are true to the muse.  The orchestrations are wonderful.  Other tributes gild the lilly with show biz, the arrangements on &quot;Concert for George&quot; add a beautiful texture.  &quot;Something&quot; is alone worth the purchase.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|There is rarely a day goes by that something by Enigma does'nt end up on my CD player, the music inspires me and feeds my soul. But, this latest CD which I have been eagerly anticipating for the last three odd years is.... to put it bluntly....PANTS. I actually returned it to the store and exchanged it for something by Delerium. A sad day indeed.
0060194995|5.0|I first read this book at about 11 because I had heard it was a good one.  I hated it.  However, about 2 years later, I had to read it for a school project and I absoulty LOVED it!  This is a wonderful, bittersweet novel about growing up in the South around the 50's and having to choose between reputation and jusitce.   I highly reccomend this book to anyone and everyone, however, wait till you're at least 12 to fully enjoy this wonderful story for what it really is.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|After all these years of waiting for a new studio album by one of my favorite songwriters/performers, I must say this was disappointing for me. For starters, it is only ten songs. Secondly, it is overproduced...too slick. Melodies are too complex and as a result we don't get the memorable and gorgeous tunes we have grown to love from Sarah. Very mediocre by Sarah standards, I'm afraid.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I'm neither a country music fan nor a Johnny Cash fan (I found \\"The Essential Johnny Cash\\" to be mostly boring), but I think this is one of the finest albums of any type that I've ever heard.  Pain and death just don't get any better than this.  <br />The depth and power of Cash's rendition of \\"Hurt\\" is incredible.  Simon & Garfunkel's version of \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" seems pale and limp in comparison to Cash's.  Cash's rendition of Tex Ritter's  \\"Sam Hall\\" earns two hoots and a hollar at least.  And Cash's own compositions are among the best he'd ever done (or at least as good as or better than the best tracks on \\"The Essential Johnny Cash\\").  There's not a bad track on the album.  He even manages to make \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" tolerable.  And that's no mean feat.<br />One final note:  I'd definitely recommend spending the extra three bucks to get the version with the bonus DVD of \\"Hurt.\\"  Amazingly powerful stuff.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is probably the most adventurous of the Dire Straits CDs, featuring long, complex instrumental solos, especially by leader Mark Knopfler whose guitar playing is a wonder.  \\"Telegraph Road\\", one of Knopfler's best songs, is an epic tale in 14 minutes.  \\"Private Investigations\\" starts slow and boring with semi-spoken lyrics but has a spectacular three-guitar, keyboard, and drum instrumental finale.  The bass lays down a heavy slow rhythm, Knopfler's classic acoustic carries the melody, and the rhythm guitar and piano add powerful dramatic riffs.     I was wowed too by \\"It Never Rains\\" which features Knopfler consciously singing like Dylan but then doing his own thing with a long, rocking finale that features a ringing guitar pitched high enough to make your ears tingle.  \\"Love on Gold\\" was recorded about the time that Mark Knopfler was working with Dylan, so the Dylanesque touch is legit.  Did Dire Straits influence Dylan?                There are only five songs (41 minutes of music) on this CD. The complexities of each song make up for their lack of numbers and the instrumentation is as good as any I've ever heard.  These guys can play their instruments.
B000089CJI|5.0|Music like this doesn't get radio play here in Baltimore.  It's too sophisticated.  It's too intelligent.  It's too unique.  The Postal Service's Give Up ain't no music for the masses.  This is an album of refreshing originality and creativity released during a year filled with stale, redundant music topping the charts.  <br />Because I can't survive on a musical diet consisting of the junk on today's radio, I've turned to the internet as a place to discover of new artists.  Through research on Amazon.com, I discovered this album, listened to the samples of album tracks, and decided to buy it.  Give Up has been such a treat - I have thorougly enjoyed this CD - and I just learned that it ranked #3 on Amazon's Editor's list of best albums of 2003.  I'd have to agree with the editor; this album deserves the honor.  <br />Give Up consists of electronic music programmed with compelling melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and effects.  There's a definitive pop sensibility underneath it all, defining the music as more than a listening curiosity - in fact, these songs sound GOOD; they're infectious, and as a listener you'll find yourself singing along.  <br />Speaking of singing, Ben Gibbard's voice is perfectly suited for this music.  He sings with a stoicism and temperance to complement the near machinistic sounds supporting him.  The lyrics are literate, unpredictable, and imaginative.  Jen Wood's appearance as a female vocalist is also a great addition on the tracks where she performs.  <br />There isn't an expendable tune on this album.  Every song is deftly crafted and contains unexpected twists in composition.  This album is clearly a pleaser for the not-so-casual listener.  If you're looking for something more than the inescapable cookie-cutter music all over today's airwaves, then I'd highly recommend this album to you.
B00009TB5G|5.0|OK i just got the movie and havn't seen the extended edition yet. But from what i can tell it is supposed to be a lot better. You get more bacground info on Faramir. THIS IS A GREAT BOX SET!!! BUT IT!!

B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney has out done herself on this Christmas album.<BR>Each song has a new, but classic feel to it. The album also has a live feel to it. The album is a step above other Christmas albums, because the arrangement is not over done. The highlights on the album are O Holy Night, I'll Be Home For Christmas,One Wish, Little Drummer Boy and Joy to the World.<br />This is the must have Christmas album and stocking stuffer for this year and many years to come.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|For years I'd thought that the Let It Be album must have been bloated with unnecessary orchestrations that got in the way of what might have been an otherwise halfway decent collection of Beatles songs. This release proves me wrong. If you have the original \\"Let It Be\\" album this one is entirely unnecessary unless you wish to scrape the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />For instance, I'd always assumed that \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" would still be sappy but would be redeemed by the removal of the intrusive string section. Wrong. I'd expected that it would now be a lovely melody played on solo piano but instead there seem to be sections of the song that seem unfinished.<br /><br />This album still contains the liability of some of the Beatles' weakest material, e.g. I Dig A Pony and I've Got A Feeling, and the brief album cuts still sound like the filler they were thirty three years ago. Get Back still ends prematurely but its humorous ending (\\"I hope we pass the audition\\") is gone, removing the one touch of distinction the truncated album version had. Now it's just another take pulled out of the can.<br /><br />The 21 minutes of \\"fly on the wall\\" studio chatter on disk two is pretty spotty even for studio banter. While there are a couple passing moments of interest, as a whole this is not something I'll ever play again. To make matters worse the entire CD is a single track so you have to fast forward if you want to get to the even marginally interesting stuff at the end.<br /><br />Let It Be was never much of a Beatles album to begin with but unfortunately this reissue does nothing to improve that stature. If I'd heard it before I'd bought it I would have spent my leisure cash on something else...

B000053VAF|5.0|This movie represents Kevin Smith's transition into a great storyteller.  Even though I loved Chasing Amy, this movie goes a step further.  I am actually kind of disappointed that he made that awful Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back after this masterpiece.But anyway...<BR>First of all this movie is very, very funny.  Kevin Smith has a great skill for making funny movies.  Every actor portrays their characters flawlessly, and are convincing.  This movie is also incredibly significant socially, and this is what i am impressed with as far as the story writing goes.  First of all Kevin Smith's biblical and theological knowledge was definitely impressive, and the story was surprisingly indepth.  The story is a great criticism of what humans have done to faith and spirituality.  Don't misconstrue the facts into thinking this is a criticism of faith and that he doesn't like religion.  It is merely a criticism of what we have silly humans have done to beautiful things like faith and religion.  That all being said, buy this movie for its comedic value alone, and you will miss out on one of the best social commentaries of our time.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|It all started when I heard sunrise on the radio-I had to find out who was sampling Hall and Oates. Once I did, I got on the CDNOW website to check out the other tunes...I WAS HOOKED!!! This album has some REAL music here. I've always enjoyed Simply Red, but this album is Simply AWESOME. &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot; is absolutely wonderful. Too bad new pop music can't have the same emotion. Sunrise is the most respectable &quot;sample&quot; tune I've ever heard. Congratulations, Simply Red, you have a sure hit with me.
B000021XS0|5.0|Where to begin? Dream Theater had made thier best album up to this point with Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. What makes this album so great? One: They are all talented musical geniuses. This album is composed of rythms that all guitarists, bassists, pianists, or drummers look up two. Not all are fast and hard rythms, but there are also soft and slow moments to fit the storyline. Which brings up point number two: the story. This is a progressive CD in its true sence. It contains a real plot, and the characters develop. The story is sung from the different points of views of the characters. Three: aweness....if this makes any sense. This album will leave you in awe. I listen to it everyday and never have heard of such a well composed group. I recomend this CD to everyone.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Why such a fuss is being made over The Beatles &quot;Let It Be - Naked&quot; CD is a mystery to me. Growing up with The Beatles this album came as a great disappointment to me in 1970 - especially after their masterpiece &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. The remixing and elimination of the Phil Spector strings are definitely a great improvement but as a long time fan of one the greatest band ever I advise you to save your money and pass on this CD. PS - The &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; bonus disc is a montage of The Beatles' conversations and musical snippits from the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions which is nothing special.

I'll put it another way: On her worst day, she's making better music than most of these other so-called &quot;artists.&quot; Worldwide Underground quite successfully accomplishes her mission, which was obviously to get folks ta bobbin' dey head! I like this cd; it's just what it says it is: Extended Play.
B000003TAW|5.0|first of id like to say that weezer is my favorite band.  THEY ROCK.  Next id like to say that this album is there best and this album deserves 10 stars it is that good.  Every single song is plain-out awesome.  Now with the real reson i am reviewing this, if you can find a reviewer named fellonblackdays, he is very dumb.  He writes that SAY IT AINT SO is the worst on the album.  THIS IS BS. Do not believe him. like i said - he is dumb. IN fact it is the best on the album, and, to tell you the truth, after listening to every single weezer song every produced, SAY IT AINT SO is the best weezer song overall. other songs are buddy holly, sweater song, only in dreams, surf wax america, in the garage, holiday, my name is jonas, no one else, TWHTALMH, no one else - oh thats the whole album cuz its all good. So definetly by this album, and show ur friends, cuz you'll hook them, too.
B000078DOI|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best albums released by RHCP. The Best Tracks are Higher Ground, Taste The Pain, Knock Me Down, Good Time Boys &amp; Fire (With Hillel Slovak bot Frusciante). All these people who like by the way are not the true fans. The Die Hard Fans would know about Jack Sherman &amp; Cliff Martinez in their first album not slovak &amp; irons. But anyway this is the 2nd best RHCP ALbum, with Freaky Styley coming close behind

B0000AUHPG|5.0|Personal disclaimer: Once Upon a Time in the West is one of my favorite films.<br />Film Rating: 5 out of 5 stars<BR>DVD Video Quality: 4 (which is very good considering it's a 1968 film)<BR>DVD Audio Quality: 3 (ditto)<BR>DVD Features: 3<BR>Overall: 5 stars (for amazing film and great DVD presentation)<br />If you watch Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, you might notice how heavily it is influenced by Once Upon a Time in the West (among other films, of course). An ambiguous and flawed hero, very evil yet charismatic villain, the way music is used, minimal plot and dialog (later is very rare for Tarantino), and what appears to be style over substance. But I digress.<br />While Once Upon a Time in the West appears to be largely devoid of plot (especially upon first viewing), and perhaps even a little boring to newcomers given its generous running time, underneath its stylish layer are statements larger than life. To me, it summarizes what America was up to that point, an epitaph of the old west. When Jill's theme swells up again for the last time, I am both sadden and hopeful all at once. The effect is very powerful. Regardless of what has happened up to that point (or how little), we realize that a force larger than five central characters has taken over, signaling the end of one era and the beginning of new America.<br />Once Upon a Time in the West marks the first chapter in director Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time' trilogy, which continues with A Fistful of Dynamite and ends with Once Upon a Time in America. In all three films, he collaborated with composer Ennio Morricone to create something of an epic opera. That is, Morricone wrote all the music before the filming began. And indeed, the film plays like an opera with careful compositions and perfectly synchronized action, sound, dialog, and music. Performances are superb throughout, with amazingly authentic looking costumes and sets (all very dirty and worn out looking), beautiful cinematography, and catchy dialogs (sparsely spoken for more dramatic effect). Note: dialog was dubbed later on, sometimes by a different actor (replacing Italian actor), which accounts for dialog and picture going out of synchronization from time to time.<br />Once Upon a Time in the West is heavily influenced by many other westerns (most prominently Johnny Guitar and Shane) and it shows. But it also attempts to summarize and put an end to once popular film genre (until Dances With Wolves and Unforgiven).<br />Paramount has done an outstanding job with this DVD set. Minor signs of edge enhancement notwithstanding, the film has never looked better. The print looks amazingly clean with great shadow details and beautiful range of color. Restored soundtracks, both original mono and remixed 5.1-channel surround sound very good for a 1968 film. I recommend the 5.1-channel track to better appreciate Morricone's beautiful score, which thankfully leaves the dialog and sound effects anchored to the center channel most of the time (instead of gimmickry repositioned mix).<br />The supplemental materials are few in between, but effectively presented. The audio commentary track does a nice job giving newcomers background information (by Leone biographer Christopher Frayling, directors John Carpenter, John Millius, and Alex Cox, Claudia Cardinale, and few others). 3-part short documentaries feature interviews and footage giving background information about the filmmakers, film's origin, makings of the film, and its aftermath. Still photos (particularly noteworthy for showing how much the locations have changed), documentary short on the railroad revolution, and trailer round up the package.
B00006EXL5|4.0|alright all you kids that think you know what youre talking about, mcr is really a great band but not as good as their hype makes them out to be. they have a very original style, taking sort of old AFI dark punk style mixing it with some modern emocore, and the results arent bad at all. yes mcr did just get signed to reprise as a result of thursday blowing up, and that will prbably ruin the integrity this band has, so enjoy this album, it will probably be their best. my favorite songs on this are Vampires will never hurt you, demolition lovers, and early sunsets over monroeville, which is really one of the best songs ive heard in a longggg time.<BR>if youre lookin for a different style on this whole emo punk thing, get this cd, if youre sick of it like alot of people are, stay away.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|I've always been intrigued by the story behind the Let It Be album. We all know it was an effort by the band to \\"Get Back\\" to its roots, yet it also exposed the tension in the band. I saw the documentary when I was a kid, and always wondered why the original album sounded different from the movie. Let It Be...Naked doesn't exactly resolve this, but it is intriguing in that shorn of the Spector treatment, we get a truer sense of the intentions for the album. Yet with this cleaned up version, I still wonder if this is what the originally titled \\"Get Back\\" album was supposed to be, and just how much over-dubbing was done on these tracks. Sonically, it sounds wonderful. And many of the tracks use alternate takes from the original Let it Be record(the title track, Long and Winding Road, Dig a Pony, I've Got A Feeling). Get Back is the opening track (as intended?) and though it is one of the Beatles' best tunes, I miss the coda that is edited to the single version, and even the pithy ending on the orginal album. This version just ends abruptly. But I do like the songs stripped of the Spectorization...they do have a more bar band feel. And that's good, because we tend to forget that the Beatles were a great live act. Now can we get the version that Glyn Johns originally mixed *before* Phil Spector?
B0000C9V3T|4.0|While not the best soundtrack for a Quentin Tarantino film -- both &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; far outshine this one -- &quot;Kill Bill, Volume 1&quot; shows that, once again, Tarantino is highly gifted when it comes to assembling a soundtrack that plays off his passions, showcases his sense of humor, and stands as an enjoyable companion piece to the film, even enjoyed on its own.<br />The soundtrack, like the film, opens with Nancy Sinatra's &quot;Bang Bang,&quot; a song that if it hadn't been performed by an artist whose biggest successes were four decades ago, one would think had been written specifically for the film, as it perfectly captures the theme and underlying tragic tone. As it is, it's a great example of Tarantino's obsessive love of pop culture trivia and a willingness to cram together eclectic, even lunatic, disparate influences.<br />Likewise, the soundtrack shows off his smart alec sense of humor, including his use of the &quot;Ironside&quot; theme song, used in the picture for the Bride's escape from the hospital when she does not have the use of her legs and is a wheelchair-bound refugee. The inclusion of the &quot;Green Hornet&quot; theme is another joke in the same vein.<br />As always, Tarantino includes sound clips from the movie on this soundtrack. Unfortunately, unlike previous efforts, there are only two such clips on this album, and both of them are mix rather quietly, making it difficult to discern what the characters are saying without turning up the volume to a level that will blow out eardrums (or perhaps even speakers) when the music is resumed.<br />This is also an &quot;enhanced&quot; CD, and includes three trailers. Note that, no matter what settings you change on Windows XP, the disc is determined to run its start up program whenever it's inserted into a computer, and stability issues may thus arise.<br />Until the first edition appears on DVD, and the second volume appears in theaters, this soundtrack is the only additional &quot;Kill Bill&quot; material available. While it is not perfect, it's an enjoyable album in its own right, and a number of the tracks are good enough to one day make it onto a &quot;Quentin Tarantino's Greatest Soundtrack Hits&quot; album.<br />Recommended for fans of &quot;Kill Bill&quot; eagerly awaiting the second half of the movie.is the only additional &quot;Kill Bill&quot; material available.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have liked Britney since she came out a couple of years ago, but it is time that she finally came out with something that shows she has what it takes to stay.  The whole cd is awesome in the fact that it never really falls into one type of song or another.  There really are no weak tracks on this cd, and in my opinion, the stand out songs are Shadow and Breath on Me.  This was music written by her, with her input on all the tracks, not something generated by a music making &quot;factory&quot; telling her what to sing.  When a song can make you say &quot;yeah, I've felt like that&quot; then you know it is worth buying.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Interesting, I guess she wants Madonna to hit her baby, one more time.  Britney was good when her first CD came out and I loved it.  When &quot;The Neptunes&quot; produced her second CD's hit (though they just took the beat from Philly's Most Wanted's 'Please Don't Mind') that was tight, too.  Now, she's gotten ridiculous.  Don't get this CD, get Cyndi Lauper's new one instead.
B00005JLTN|3.0|This is in response to the controvercy about the labeling of DVD screen formats, and what they mean. If you want the &quot;complete&quot; image that was filmed, many of the Full Screen DVD's contain more screen image than the &quot;matted&quot; Wide Screen...as is the case of Matrix Reloaded. If you freeze frame the exact frame from both versions of Matrix Reloaded (as I did), you will see there is more image on top and bottom of the same scene in the Full Screen version. This unfortunately, is the case with many of the recent releases as studios just &quot;matt&quot; the Full Screen to get a Wide Screen version. Only when they are photographed in a wide screen format (like Cinemascope, Panavision, etc.), do you get more images on the side edges. The MGM website explains this procedure better....also check the difference on the double format DVD's for yourself....they average about 50/50 which formate shows more image.. so the decision about which format to buy will be easier when the studios find a better way to identify the formats and what is important to the buyer .... now, are you totally confused?<BR>   Oh yeah...thought Matrix Reloaded was &quot;entertaining&quot;, but a big let down with loopholes galore....
B00003CXXJ|5.0|To me, it seems that people are overstating how much tweaking Disney's taking in &quot;Shrek.&quot; Unless I missed something, fairy tales didn't begin with the House That Walt Built, and that's what &quot;Shrek&quot; spends most of its time chipping away at. (Of course, there's also a very funny riff on Disneyland when Shrek arrives to see Lord Farquar, but that's really it for pure Disney-bashing.)<br />Adults who might think that they've seen all the funny fairy tales they can handle should think again: While there's enough fart jokes, talking animals and slapstick to keep the kids entertained, &quot;Shrek&quot; is an adult movie, with low key racy jokes (kids who even notice the &quot;big castle compensating for Lord Farquar's deficiencies&quot; gag will likely assume it's talking about his height, or lack thereof), some very (post-)modern looks at fairy tales (Cinderella's described as being emotionally abused ... well, that sounds about right) and the nerve to say that the princess/Prince Charming fantasy so many fairy tales were built around is garbage.<br />Sure, anyone who's ever seen a major motion picture can guess that it ends up with &quot;They All Lived Happily Ever After,&quot; but any movie that starts off with an ogre using a book of classic fairy tales as toilet paper is going to get there in its own backhanded style. Surprisingly, &quot;Shrek&quot; steers around the pitfalls and never becomes cloying or trite or gives up on its own cockeyed realist view of fairy tales and destructive fantasies (as opposed to the perfectly fine and rather sweet, in their own dim way, fairy tale creatures endangered by the evil pro-rationality and pro-order lord).<br />While it's the writing that really makes &quot;Shrek&quot; work, John Lithgow and Eddie Murphy fling themselves into their roles, making what could have been fairly generic animated characters into memorable performances. Murphy in particular seems freed to do his best work when he's hidden from view as in &quot;Mulan,&quot; and Lithgow, whom many now only know through his goofy &quot;Third Rock from the Sun&quot; role, gets to stretch out his more threatening riffs, as he used to prior to landing on the sitcom.<br />&quot;Shrek&quot; is that rarest of animated movies: One that's genuinely fun for the whole family. See it with or without kids, but see it.<br />All of this is further enhanced by a DVD package that, if not stuffed with extras, has all high quality additions actually worth checking out.<br />Highly recommended for kids from 8-80.as in &quot;Mulan,&quot; and Lithgow, whom many now only know through his goofy &quot;Third Rock from the Sun&quot; role, gets to stretch out his more threatening riffs, as he used to prior to landing on the sitcom.<br />&quot;Shrek&quot; is that rarest of animated movies: One that's genuinely fun for the whole family.

B00005JLYW|3.0|... you'll love the second one.  The crazy stunts are even more preposterous, the jokes more raunchy, and the intensity gets a good jolt.  However, this movie suffers from the same banal writing as the first.  Most of the movie consists of cue-card dialogue and cookie cutter action sequences.  There are a few gems in the rough, including a scene where Drew Barrymore runs into machismo in Mexico, and a really funny rendition of MC Hammer dancing.  The unfolding helicopter is impressive.  If you're looking for a light fluffy movie for a date, where you don't have to pay close attention to get the drift of what's going on, this is it.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Excellent cd! Loved it! Best since Baduism. She was slippin a little on Mamas Gun to me. But she's back on point with this one. I loved every track.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my boyfriend for Christmas.  I, of course, had to view it personally before wrapping it up to give him to see if I had gotten my money's worth.  I can assure you that I did.  He will enjoy this for years to come. This is an AWESOME show put on by Shania.  She did an outstanding job..I would recommend this DVD to anyone.
B00005JLT5|4.0|I am kind of torn as to what to think about this movie.  While watching it, I was annoyed because I have seen it all before.  There have been tons of movies on holocaust and of the individual incidents displayed here.  There is even a movie that covers the Warsaw ghetto rebellion in much more depth.  This movie didn't really say anything new.  But, then I think, so what.  There are tons of great movies out there that are remakes or cover old ground.  <br />The real beauty of this movie is the vivid recreation of Warsaw during WWII.  You really get the feeling that you are there.  That makes this movie a journey worth taking.<br />The movie does have some problems.  The hero is not very engaging.  He is like Candide who experiences one adventure after the other, without making any impact.  All he is there for is to have someone's eyes to see the action.<br />Roman Polanski, the director, talks about how this character represents an affirmation and celebration of life.  I don't get that feeling at all.  You especially get no feeling of how this event affected him, shaped him or how he moved on after the war.<br />The other problem with this movie is that it is just boring and slow in some parts.  Too much time is spent sitting around in a room with nothing happening.  In some respects, this does give you an idea of tedious and boring his life must have been at times, but you really don't get an idea of how he responded to it.<br />The main bonus features of the DVD is a &quot;making of&quot; short and bio of the director, Roman Polanski. It shows why he had such passion for making the movie.  It explains how Polanksi grew up during WWII in Poland and how he suffered through some of the atrociities.<br />But, Polanski painful childhood is still no excuse for what he did later in life.  He drugged and sodomized a thirteen year old girl in the US and then fled to Europe.  Should we be honoring such a person?
B00005JLSE|3.0|Chicago is a great old musical.  It has a funny story, and good characters.  Unforunately, in my opinion at least, Renee Zellweger has ruined it.  She does not have the stage presence or voice to play the lead in even a movie musical.  Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere on the other hand are stunning.  John Reilly (universally beloved schleppy husband) does a fantastic version of &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot;, almost worth the price of admission in itself.  These actors play their roles to a &quot;T&quot;, sleazy but sincere.  They pour a lot of love into their characters, while Zellweger's feels cold and impersonal.  It's a true shame, because of the other actors and because the production itself is so well done.  The costumes, soundtrack, lighting and camera angles are fantastic.  Bravos to the cast, boos to Zellweger.
B000084T18|1.0|There should be a rating on here for zero stars because I dont even think that &quot;50 cent&quot; deserves even one. This quite possibly may be the crappiest CD Ive ever heard. It is a disgrace to music and I cant beleive that people actually waste their money on it. Now, before you start judging me based on my opinion, let me tell you this: I know alot about music, I make it myself, and I actually do like rap, but the keyword is GOOD rap. I cant stand this type of repetitive, unoriginal, sad excuse for music which has no meaning, no point, and is uncomprehendable since he makes up words because he cant rhyme. It seems like to me that a record company wanted to make &quot;the next cool thing&quot; so they grabbed a random person off the street and made him famous so they could get a bunch of money. I make music myself, and Ive made better stuff than this without even trying. Here's my advice to 50 cent as a fellow artist: 1. get some talent 2. Either that, or shut the hell up.<BR>Now, excuse me, I have to go to the store and buy some gum with my 50 cents (pronounced FIF-TEE SENTS)
B00008J4P5|5.0|Forget about the hype, forget about comparisons, and what youll see is a startling fresh and original album. What makes this band special is the emotional energy Jack White is able to deliver, and it looks like hes able to drink it deep down from some archetypical level straight to his voice and guitar playing. No excess, no artificialisms, nothing unnecessary disturbs this pure flow. The solo on Ball and Biscuit is probably the most expressive one Ive ever heard, and even if he seems to be gifted enough to get a little closer to Page, like some might wish, I dont think he gives a damn about it - and Im glad he never trades the feel of the song for the technique. Besides, theres no need for a better drummer for what makes this band the best on what its the best, and whoever search for virtuosis among percussionists should start listening to some jazz or Brazilian music instead.

B00005JKN9|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis shines amidst a wrenching, brutal film that focuses far too much on violence.  Violence in itself is really not that exciting; seeing someone beaten to death with a cudgel is not my idea of a good time, especially after the third or fourth time in the same movie.  I had unpleasant nightmares about it afterwards.  Instead, they should have treated Di Caprio as Reeves was treated in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and let Daniel Day Lewis rule the film.  He is to Gangs of New York as Johnny Depp is to Pirates of the Carribean; so far into character as to be indistinguishable from the role he plays.  Not many actors can be so convincing, but Day-Lewis pulls it off with effortless charm.  He is one of the great actors of the day.  The rest of the film would be pointless without him, and it treads on the edge of inconsequential faux-historical fiction far too many times.  Scorcese is a master, but you wouldn't know it from this film.  Watch this for Daniel Day-Lewis.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|With the new release of the Special Collector's Edition of Star Trek V on DVD, I thought it would be a good time to review the picture.<br />What can I say? ST:5 is weak on many levels.<br />First, the ship's crew is way too small, less than a skeleton crew (they had like, what, five trainees besides the Classic cast?). Second, the ship is far more buggy than it should be. It's not as if General Dynamics builds these things, after all, it's suppossed to be a starship! A few bugs, sure, but to be in as bad a shape as the new ship is strains credibility.<br />Then there's the whole \\"barrier\\" thing. As any Trek fan worth his toy tricorder knows, the \\"barrier\\" is not at the center of the galaxy, but at the edge. It's also supposed to be pink, not Indiglo blue. Of course, they simply should have called this new \\"barrier\\" something else, but be that as it may, this kind of slip highlights a certain basic sloppiness in the production. Also, the ship gets there way too quickly, and the skeleton crew is subverted to Sybok's vision too easily (is only Kirk capable of putting up a fight?).<br />And what about Sybok? \\"Where'd he come from?!\\" (or so I asked when I first saw the picture). Another good question would be, \\"Where'd he get all this power?! Regular Vulcans don't have it, so why should he?\\"<br />There's plenty of dopiness on hand to be sure, but if I had to point out any one element that brings the picture down, it would have to be the effects. As Shatner himself comments in one of the featurettes on the new disc, they \\"were not well-served\\" by the New Jersey-based effects team hired for the film. They were out of their league, and it shows.<br />The effects range from really interesting to really bad. The more interesting ones are almost totally confined to the luminous dyes and other elements used on the \\"God\\" planet. The worst effects are reserved for the starships. For example, when the Enterprise escapes a Kingon torpedo, the ship looks clunky and \\"pasted\\" onto the backgrounds, the sudden motion not realistic or believeable. Other shots share the poor movement, and the shabby lighting of the models just adds to the cheap-o look of the movie.<br />As for the entity imprisoned on Shakaree, it's a plot point taken directly from one of the animated Trek episodes, and was adapted into one of the \\"Log\\" books which recounted the animated episodes in novel-length form.<br />So, what we have here is a pretty weak Trek, with bad effects and a mish-mosh of dull plot points.<br />On the other hand, out of all the Trek movies, ST:5 feels the most like a television episode (no doubt, due mostly to Shatner's directing experience up to that point).<br />Lukinbill's Sybok is really a pretty interesting character. His ability to control others through charisma is excellently portrayed, too.<br />The Yosemite elements at the beginning and end of the film are the best and most personal depiction of the interaction between the triad of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy. The \\"visions\\" of Spock and McCoy are pretty powerful (some of Spock's vision were cut, and are on Disc 2 as an extra). The attack on Paradise City is well staged. Lots of action, and when Kirk gets attacked by the cat dancer, you don't even wonder why he went in the bar without having his phaser drawn. The humor used throughout the picture is also right on the money.<br />But despite all of the plusses, the film just doesn't seem to overcome all of the minuses. The film strikes an odd note at best, and is the pariah of Trek movies at the worst.<br />The DVD treatment of the film in the new 2-disc set is very nice. The animated menus are probably some of the best in the Trek movie sets so far, and there are plenty of interesting elements. Besides the usual intellegent documentaries (one dealing with the search for God), the Kingon couple is interviewed, and the \\"making of\\" documentary is comprehensive, (if a bit one-hand-tied-behind-its-back). Deleted scenes are on Disc 2 (pretty much all but the extended Spock-vision deserved to be cut, I think), and there is some rock-man footage that shows us what the monsters were supposed to have looked like. There is also a press conference held on the ST:5 bridge, and a video pitch from Harve Bennett to the Paramount sales staff. The extras earn it an extra star, I think, the movie being a \\"3\\".<br />The disc is worth adding to your collection, especially for Classic Trek fans. Time may have afforded fans the ability to forgive the film somewhat, as it is a product from the pre-sickeningly PC Trek of the 90's and today that fans are forced to suffer. Time may also help the fan hate the bad elements of the movie less, and appreciate the good elements of the movie more.<br />So is ST:5 moronic, or just misunderstood? Frankly, the answer is \\"both,\\" but it's still strangely worth watching.all but the extended Spock-vision deserved to be cut, I think), and there is some rock-man footage that shows us what the monsters were supposed to have looked like.

B0000E1WNV|5.0|Don't believe a word about Springsteen in Europe being somehow less inspired than Springsteen in the USA. As Little Steven has pointed out, the intensity and appreciation of audiences in Europe took the band by surprise. And along with the Italians, the Spanish are the most fanatical of the lot. This shows in this DVD, where the audience actually become a part of the experience, to Bruces evident delight. It's one of the best music DVDs I've seen, by Springsteen or anyone.  The greatest live band there has ever been, caught on a great night. Buy it now.
1878424319|2.0|Ok i bought this book expecting something extraordnary, and i was vastly dissapointed.  Expectations aside, this book was just an oversimplified 'instruction' to enlightenment.  MR Ruiz seems to think he is the only wise and enlightened being on the planet.  Save your time. read the dalai lama!  ~Namaste~
B0000B1OFL|4.0|I rented this movie expecting it to be another &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot;, a vastly unbelievable and disappointing endeavour.  However, I was pleased to find that this is a crime caper with a warm fuzzy feeling - it seems very human and almost real.  The stunts are still unbelievable of course, but the acting here is what really shines -- Marky Mark does a very good job of being sincere, and Seth Green is hysterical as &quot;The Napster&quot;.  Speaking of stunts, what could be funnier than a car chase involving three Mini Coopers?  This is a great film if you want a little thrill with some good laughs and a happy ending.  Great footage of Venice too.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This cd has couple great songs.  &quot;Toxic&quot; is great, &quot;Everytime&quot;, and also &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; are also worth hearing.  Overall I feel that once again, she has tried to break her image of a young girl by adding some shock value, namely, &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;.  With the exeption of a few songs, this album is a bit boring and lacks musical talent; the beats and melodies are hard to get into.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Okay where to start? I love this whole cd. It's a very different genre for britney, more dance, less pop inspired. Every song on this cd is amazing. My only real criticism are the ballads, 'Shadow' and 'Everytime', while i like both of them they slow down the cd and sort of seem out of place. <br />Overall this cd is a major cross over for Britney; her appeal can easily expand past the self-proclaimed Britney-lovers. Way to go one more time Brit!!!!!!!!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|...for rock.  Excellent, complex sound.  It's even better loud.  Turn it up REAL loud.  After I bought it, I had to upgrade my car stereo because the old speakers buzzed before I turned it up loud enough.  All self proclaimed fans of modern music should own it.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Well, the writers and director finally got it right.  This X-men is completely unlike the first.  It's gritty, serious, and compelling.  The performances of McKellan, Stewart, and Jackman are superb.  The story is exciting, and although the final action sequence lasts a little too long, the special effects are electrifying.  There's a good mix of comedy, hope, revelation, and double-crossing.  The best part, of course, is that the \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" have to team up to defeat the greater evil.  The relationship is played very well by McKellan, and most of the other actors too.  I even shed a tear at the end when one of the characters must make the greatest sacrifice.  What can I say, I laughed, I cried, what a show.  See it.
B00005JMFR|5.0|wow, omg it was amazing incredible spectacular shocking and unbelievable:  O my heart was racing like i was sprinting a marathon through out the course of the movie, if you are reading this review you have to see this movie no matter what the retarded critics gave it ok im a girl that sees about 2 movies a week and i have been doing so for the last 3-4yrs THIS IS THE  MOST AMAZING MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE I WILL NEVER SEE ANOTHER DECENT MOVIE AGAIN I ALREADY KNO ILL B DISAPOINTED!!!!<br />~NEO LIVES ON IN MY HEART FOREVER~
6300214435|2.0|In the great chain of Indiana Jones movies, this is the regretful weak link.<br />Too much emphasis was placed on razzle-dazzle special effects, not enough on character development.<br />The scenes of graphic and sadistic violence so alarmed the film industry that the PG-13 rating was brought into being.<br />Fortunately, the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade movie put the series back on track, which was good.<br />Regretfully, though, this move was NOT good.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This film is a miracle. SO much better than the theatrical version. So much more depth and character development, and a better narrative flow. A must-have for fans of the book who missed their favorite scenes, or for anyone who loved the theatrical version but would like to see a more complete version of the film.
B00006IU73|5.0|Whenever anyone says &quot;there's no good music being made now&quot;, I am inclined to agree with them, but then I remember this album.  I listened to my local modern rock radio station the other day, and I remembered why I don't do that more often. I thought &quot;Porcupine Tree is better than this 1-dimensional nu-metal crap, why aren't they playing 'in absentia' every day?&quot;<br />One explanation:  This album is definitely complex and dense enough to require (and reward) repeated listening.  I thought this album was only so-so at first, with some good moments and some mediocre moments... but as I listened to it more and more it all began to make sense, and now I think this album is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end.  <br />Musicianship (including a monsterous new drummer, who is hyper-kinetic and tasteful at the same time), songwriting, great production.... this album is definitely worth the money.  I cannot believe that this band is not a household name.
B000025XKM|5.0|What else to say? I found him accidentally and like all Love at First Sight stories, I laughed for him, I was angry for him (at the stupidity of record co's. and the like), I cried for him (at the stupidity and his premature death) and my heart ached for him (when he sings his hopes and own aches). I heard the \\" Pink Moon\\" single from a friend and instantly I went on a search for him. I read someone'e opinion about \\"Northern Sky\\" being the most beautiful song ever written and I was offended! Obsurd! Better than \\"Pink Moon\\"? Well, I had to find out what just what he was thinking so I downloaded \\"Nothern Sky\\" and listened to it a few times and I loved it! Now I had to have more, so I downloaded \\"Hazey Jane I\\", \\"Fly\\" and \\"Road\\" (as I usually dl a few songs before I buy music of any artist), then I just jumped in all the way - on the same day, I bought Five Leaves Left, Bryter Layter, Pink Moon and Time Of No Reply (which has my favorite song called Mayfair, just so great that I have to replay it 3 or 4 times in a row!)His words and music just hurts so good. What talent! What musicianship! To be able to convey so much with so few words is just brilliant. My husband even likes Nick Drake and his style and that is saying alot-seriously. Just listening to his fingering style will send you off into a haze. Beautiful, cleansing, thoughtful, heartbreaking and hopeful - it is there in Pink Moon.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have been listening to Britney since the song &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; got me hooked in 1998, and, as evidenced by this album, she has surely grown since then. Previous interviews regarding this album had stated that Britney's new sound would be solid dance-pop, with techno/trance elements thrown in, and of course, the essential hip-hop. This album definitely delivers on all fronts. With a variety of fast to slow-tempo songs, Britney shows much versatility, although personally, her best work is done on the more mid-tempo tracks, &quot;Breathe on Me,&quot; &quot;Touch of My Hand,&quot; and &quot;Showdown.&quot; Somehow, the hip-hop/urban influence doesn't fit her and seems forced on tracks like &quot;Boom Boom (I Got That),&quot; &quot;Outrageous,&quot; and even &quot;Early Mornin'.&quot; Nevertheless, she puts forth a great effort, and her new sound is definitely worth checking into.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I didn't latch on to the story concept of this disc until I watched the accompanying DVD, where Neil Young plays a live acoustic set of the entire \\"Greendale\\" album in Dublin -- and explains what's going on every step of the way. The performance is mesmerizing and probably bests the actual album, believe it or not. Neil, his guitar and his harmonica in front of a live audience is a musical combination hard to beat. Young has such a calm presence before the camera, and he turns out to be a really engaging storyteller in his earnest, low-key way.<br /><br />As for the music on \\"Greendale,\\" it's vintage Neil Young, an outstanding CD that's warm, relaxed, tuneful and boasts the type of songs that would sound wonderful around a campfire or at a local bar. Each song tells a story about folks within Greendale, especially about the Green family, and the lyrics are impressive; one gets a true sense of this fictional family, its environment and its town. But it's the actual music on the CD, rather than the lyrics, that draw me in most. Nothing beats a tuneful riff played over and over while Young sings his rugged words and a ragged guitar solo sneaks its way in; before you know it, the time on your CD player reads 7:32 and you realize you've been listening to the same cool song in the same amount of time most artists have two songs in the can; then you remember, oh yeah, it's Neil Young, and that's what makes him so different -- his longer songs seem to never grow stale. This is just one of those records where Neil has lots to say.<br /><br />\\"Greendale\\" has a country-rock flavor right away on \\"Falling From Above,\\" and that sound continues throughout the CD. Mixed in with the engaging stories are common-sense, middle-American lyrics from some of the characters about how the simplicity of peace and love goes far in life, and how this concept is sadly underused by people today. On an even grimmer note, a surprising murder takes place within Greendale, which sets the town on fire with hysteria. Neil's ability to see life from someone else's shoes is uncanny, like on the song \\"Carmichael,\\" where he sings about a police force openly mourning the loss of its fallen comrade. \\"Bandit\\" might be the most moving song on the CD, and would be a No. 1 hit in a perfect rock and roll radio world. Other mainstream issues on \\"Greendale\\" include the invasion of the media for sensationalistic \\"stories,\\" and the right to speak your mind against a government you disagree with. \\"Greendale\\" increases in intensity toward the end when grandpa dies and Young later pulls out his megaphone to speak for Sun Green. Minus the somewhat angry-sounding ending, the music on \\"Greendale\\" comes at a relaxed pace and ends up being a great piece of work by one of the all-time greats.<br /><br />Grandpa bemoans life; Sun Green tries to change the world; grandma bemoans grandpa's loss.<br /><br />The end.ria.

Putting Britney and Madonna together was just Amazing!  The Title Track, &quot;IN THE ZONE&quot; is one that will be remembered as musical history!<br />For an upbeat and well put together and CD filled with Great Music by one of our times Best Entertainers, I could not recommend anything to put you, &quot;IN THE ZONE&quot;, better than Ms. Britney Spears!
B0000DD79B|3.0|These songs are great. That needs to go up front. And these are the songs that casual S&amp;G fans will want. But if you're like me and you have the Columbia &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, you get used to how those songs sound on this release. Some of them are the same. Some are quite different. So much so that I don't plan to get rid of my Greatest Hits CD and let this one replace it. There are NO songs on Greatest Hits that aren't on this collection, but the number of songs that sound different is large enough to justify (at least to myself) keeping that original collection.<br />Herein lies the problem, and the reason this only gets 3 stars. There is never, NEVER a reason that any disc of an anthology should be 42 minutes long! NEVER! Disc 1 is 42 minutes, Disc 2 is 55 minutes. Consider that these should be approaching 80 minutes per disc, and that's over an hour of unused disc space! Some would argue that putting &quot;filler&quot; on a CD doesn't improve anything, but not a lot of S&amp;G's music would be considered filler. I can make a better collection myself (and probably will), and fill up the discs. It's just a pet peeve of mine, so if you don't mind short anthologies, don't let me stop you.<br />Overall, the music is great. If you're a collector like me and like to have the &quot;Essential&quot; line, consider it, but beware that you're not getting much music for your money.

B0000C9ZLD|3.0|You ever anxiously await the release of a new record, only to pick it up and be mildly dissapointed?  Well this is how I felt after picking this one up.  The record is not a bad one, it just sounds like Is This It part 2.  I know this could be a good thing considering how good that album was, but I would love if they changed a little, or came up with an original album, independant from the first.  Take a cue from artists like Bowie and Madonna, who virtually reinvent themselves with each new c.d., keeping them fresh and interesting.<BR>Pick it up if you don't own the first, it's pretty good, otherwise grab their first, stick it in your player and blast the volume till your landlord throws you out!!!!!
B00009TB5G|2.0|Warning: To all possible buyers of this extended version.  I loved the first exented version DVD of the Fellowship of the Ring. I felt differently about the Two Towers. I was thoroughly disappointed with Peter Jackson's choice to include these extra scenes that were simply deleted scenes reinserted into the storyline when the pacing, story, and narrative flow were much better in the theatrical version. Imagine the first scene: Gandolf is falling to the pit after the dragon. Cut to a scene with Sam and Frodo climbing down a cliff, Sam drops something, Frodo catches it. Frodo asks, &quot;What was that Sam?&quot; Sam replies that it was some seasoning from home and he misses the shire. Seasoning? Very anti-climactic. Imagine the end the of the film. The war in helm's deep has ended. Sam has just made his amazing speech about the beautiful stories that he heard as a young hobbit. Gandolf should be about to say, &quot;The battle for Helm's Deep has ended; the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin.&quot; Instead we cut to a scene were Merry and Pippin are in the flood around Saroman's tower discovering a room full of food and smoking tobacco and wondering whether they should share it with the Ent. Some would say that the added scenes add information to the plot. They sometimes do add some background, but at the expense of a nearly ridiculous or uneventful scene. When editing a movie one asks, what is the purpose of this scene? How does it help forward the plot? None of the added scenes forwarded the plot or added to the film in such a valuable way as to merit their inclusion. The original was fast paced, exciting, dramatic. The extended version is whimsical and disappointing, better suited for a child-audience (because it has more off the collar comic relief, and makes sure everyone, I mean everyone, really understands everything 100% - even if it means repetition). The first theatrical cut made me feel I was watching an epic. The extended version made me feel I was watching a movie. A movie that needed editing. I am sorry, but rent it before you buy it and decide for yourself.
0452282152|3.0|I read this book for a book club I belong to and was disappointed with the book midway through.  Initially, I enjoyed the idea of the book, the historical placement of its characters and story, and a look into the life of an artist.  However, the writing style is best suited for high school students, i.e. it is quite simplistic, even though a few good metaphors are presented.  The plot is somewhat predictable but then becomes historically unbelievable midway.  Considering what we know of the main character, I highly doubt whether she would handle her virginity the way the author suggests.  The story then rapidly collapses towards the ending, with the author trying to finish the novel without further developing the characters or the plot.  I finished the book quite disappointed with the author's lack of effort.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I just received my Gift Box Set in the mail.  Tons of reviews on the movie itself, so thought I'd comment on the packaging.  Like the first box set, it's a first-class packaging job.  I've never seen such pride in preparing DVD packaging.  I hated to open it.  The DVD case itself matches the first extended DVD case perfectly, and they look elegant together on the shelf.  If you have the first extended film, you know what to expect.  Top-grades.  The Gollum DVD case is prepared with equal attention to detail, with an attractive book with lots of drawings about the making of Gollum, along with an accompanying DVD.  This is definitely a step-up from the \\"extras\\" in the first box set.<BR>The Gollum statue is fine, but not as impressive as the Argonath figures in the first set.  I think this is because the Gollum statue is painted, which makes it appear a little cheaper.  However, the statue captures well the feel of Gollum, and sort of creeps you out.  I found a nice dark nook somewhere in my apartment for him to stare at me and my guests from the shadows.<br />Oh yeah, the movie's pretty good too.  ;)
0743243307|4.0|For me, the real story in Brick Lane is the incredible insularity of Nanzeen's domestic existence. Setting the story in a poor and dilapidated housing development, Ali envelopes us with the sites, sounds and smells of urban London, along with Nanzeen and Chanu's familial home. Brick Lane is an absolutely realistic immigrant story and the reader really gets a feel for what it must be like for new immigrants, many of who are from poor countries such as Bangladesh, who are trying to make homes for themselves in a new country.<br />Caught in an arranged, passionless marriage to the bombastic, idealistic Chanu, Nanzeen longs for something more. She stares out at the full moon late at night and wishes most of all for a secure place in the world, and a security she has tried to seek but just cannot find. She suffers terribly from homesickness and holds onto the memories of her childhood in Gouripur with her sister - she remembers the vibrant colour, the torrential rains, the golden land, deep green paddies, the snowy cranes, the drying rice stalks, and the village women who clean the large, bloody fish.  Frustrated, frightened, and longing for independence, Nanzeen falls into a passionate relationship with Karim, a young local activist. The affair, while awakening her sexually, forces her to make life-changing decisions that reverberate throughout her family. <br />The first half of the novel is perhaps the most engaging as life in London is veiled though Nanzeen's eyes. Walking the streets of London with her sari and headscarf on, she's conscious of everyone watching her, and is startled by the differences in Western women - their short-cropped hair, and their propensity to wear trousers. Nanzeem is overwhelmed by London - the cars jamming the roads, the fatty smells, the people weaving in and out of the sidewalks and the tube stations There are some wonderful scenes describing the richness and vitality of immigrant life - the Wentworth Street Market, with its stalls lining the road, cloths draped on wire hangers in the windows, Jamaican patties on sale, and tinned foods at 40 percent off.<br />The story abounds with mouth watering descriptions of ethnic foods  - the dal, chicken wings spread in a paste of yogurt and spices, chickpeas and tomatoes stewed with cumin, and hard boiled eggs glazed in a curry seal.  So much detail is given to Nanzeen's apartment life - the papers and files, the glass showcase, the pottery tigers, lions and elephants, and a copy of the Qur'an in its special ledge. There are lots of issues raised in this book - racial unrest, the cultural clash, and the disenfranchisement of immigrant communities. Ali packs the narrative with so many concerns, that the story can be a little overwhelming, and interestingly much of the local ethnic tensions are framed against the events of 9/11. Brick Lane is an engaging and involving story, full of passion, drama and humour; it is well worth the journey. <br />Michael
B00008S2VG|5.0|The entire album is worth listening. And &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; is my life in 2003. I listen to this song everyday!!!
B000066AXC|5.0|John Nash, a Nobel prize-winning mathematical genius afflicted with schizophrenia, had an incredible life. Russell Crowe does an amazing job wresting this performance into a groundbreaking movie.  Ron Howard did a spectacular job directing this difficult material and creating a memorable movie that follows Nash from his early days at Princeton thru a long series of delusions involving persecution by the Department of Defense, a child of an imaginary friend who never seems to age - and it's that last fact that Nash finally uses to convince himself of what others have been trying to tell him for years: he's crazy. So began his slow recovery with nothing but will power and the love of a good woman.<BR>I know, I know: it's not totally factual and leaves out some important dirty laundry that the filmmakers would rather have left in the closet, but still.<BR>It's fantastic.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The Concert DVD Shania Live in Chicago Raises the bar on Concert Videos. A definate MUST buy for any fan to get their fix of SHANIA until she comes to a city near you! Or for those that can't afford the cost of a concert ticket, it's the next best thing!  For those planning on attending the live performance, a sneak peak into what they will see and hear. The DVD blends Stage performance with audience shots and also some audience participation! I can't wait to see Shania on tour, but until then I can watch the video over and over, that's the beauty of a DVD or VHS concert recording!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania DVD is awesome.  If you like to watch Shania in concert, then this DVD is a must have.  This is the concert special she had earlier this summer that was shown on tv.  DVD includes several more songs that weren't included on that special.  A must have for any Shania fan.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I never saw the short version, and don't intend to, so this is strictly about the extended version.  I have two complaints about pointless deviations from the book; one, the way the ents made up their mind, and two the side trip with Faramir.<br />Well, so what, because all the characters are present and pretty much faithfully execute the general themes.  I have no objections to side issues like what the heck were the elves doing at Helm's Deep and so forth.  It's a movie, not the book, I've managed to live with that concept quite comfortably.<br />And what a movie!  Like I said, I don't know about the theatrical version, but this one is an excellent two-night experience, exciting and interesting throughout.  I really liked some of the stuff not covered in the book, like the flashback with Boromir and Faramir, that was really good.  And I thought the Arwen twist combined with the possible earthly Aragorn/Eowyn connection was a good plot element to add.  No objections at all, I found all the elvish chat with Elrond most entertaining.<br />Oh yeah, Brad Dourif is perfect as Grima, played that to the hilt.  Maybe more &quot;name&quot; actors would have been better in some of the roles, they are known for a reason, they are good at their craft, as Dourif illustrated well.<br />Petty, petty complaints.  This is wonderful stuff.  I'll look forward next year to the last extended set!
B0000CAQ27|3.0|MIZZUNDASTOOD was Pink's transitional album, undoubtedly worthy of a comparison to Madonna's early reinventions.  Like Madonna, Pink ain't perfect and this album is a reflection of her daunting task to outdo herself yet again.  THe first half instills high hopes, with the raucously catchy TROUBLE (which inexplicably flopped early on radio), GOD is a DJ (a surefit club anthem), and the naughty Oh My God featuring Peaches.  In Oh My God, Pink pushes the envelope in having Peaches whisper sweet nothings to her lover, asking him to make her &quot;meat slide.&quot;  Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, a beautiful and soulful performance by a natural singer, portrays Pink in a classic musical moment.  Nonetheless, the rest of the album suffers from overproduced and commercial soundscapes that recall much of Avril's debut album.  Hopefully, she's calculating her next reinvention to prove that MIZZUNDASTOOD was not a fluke.
B00005JMFR|5.0|This movie was EXCELLENT.  They have the gutts to do what other movie makers have not done before.  The story is about a cause, not necessarily about the people, but yet they introduce us to so many great characters that believe in this cause.  Because it is about the idea, it is a truly great film and they can go where other films have not.  Someone once said, \\"Small people talk about other people, average people talk about events, great people talk about ideas.\\"  I think that applies to this film.  They still do a great job with the characters, but this time it's actually about something worth thinking about.<br />The story ends more beautifully than I could have hoped for... I love the way they ended it, though I hate to see this trilogy over.  It's one of my favorites forever more now, even perhaps outdoing my love for the Indiana Jones trio because it has no ugly middle movie- it's a perfect trio.
076790592X|5.0|Personally I really enjoyed reading this book.  Even though I'm not a really big reader, this is definitly a book worth reading.  Morrie whole look on life gave me a different perspective on the way I should live my life.  I'm you don't always have to be doing something every single minute of the day, just relax.  Be at peace with yourself, then you will be able to give peace to each other.  Morrie also helped me to just be happy with who I am and not worry about what other people think.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|this is the most metallic album by DT i have heard..granted i dont have all their albums, including this one i have &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; and &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot;...but this album makes me love them even more...there is a lot of metal riffing on this album, as well as a ton of ripping solos by John Petrucci...i highly recommend this album for any fan of the song &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; off 'Six Degrees...', and really for any fan of the more metal side of Dream Theater....either way, fantastic album, one of my new favs of 2003!!
B00005JMFR|5.0|Okay this movie has gotten some really bad reviews...some people cant just cope with the fact that it is of different style of the last two Matrix Movies. This one is more so a War movie than Kung-Fu kick your ass movie. It has a lot of depth to it. and a lot of emotions in it. The last finght of the movie is really cool...but I thought it could have of been longer and more of the Matrix Style. There are no where near as many fight senes in this movie. Above all I really like it and you just have to accept that its different than the last two.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|As a former FM album DJ, I miss the rooftop concert chatter and especially the \\"Thankyou on behalf of the band...\\"  The rooftop portion should be released intact...  They were a great band and never again will any group of Pop musicians have such a large impact on a culture.  Not on our culture anyway.
0375422307|5.0|I simply could not put down this book after I started reading it. It refreshed my memories of revolution and war, memories that I thought were gone. I have come to realize that every life is a novel, but not many people can read it, and even fewer people can write their own. Marjane has done this for a whole generation. <br />The book is full of humor, but it's not always funny. Some of the illustrations make you freeze. It was so powerful that inspired me to learn illustration!
B000099T2L|5.0|Well I'll start off by saying that Beyonce has an amazing voice which is just enough to carry the album. &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot; are great singles but there are highly underated ballads such as &quot;Gift from virgo&quot; and &quot;Speechless&quot;. Honestly to really get the full effect of this album it has to be listened to quite a few times. As for her first effort as a solo bravo Beyonce!
B0000CDLA7|3.0|DT is known for music of epic proportions. Every album comes out to meet inhumane expectations from delirious fans still struggling to come out of the 'Awake', 'Images and Words' and 'Scenes from a Memory' period.<br />This album is heavy,really heavy even for DT. But, they set out to do exactly that and in the process have done well. We can all say that 'DT could have underplayed many parts that are heavy and pointless' but again, they wanted it that way. Every 10 seconds you feel that 'Ah! this sounds like a band i've heard before'. This whole album reminds you of a countless bands, yet, this is essentially Dream Theater and not a ripp off.<br />There are many great moments in this album. Some blistering solos and drumming. Labrie has done a great job considering the enormous difficulty in singing for DT which none realise. The melody and soul is still wanting though. But for a 'hard rock' or metallic album, it is way too difficult to crush in all that into 70 minutes of hair raising music.<br />All in all, this is a great album for 'Metal lovers' and a little disspointment for the 'elite DT lovers' like me who are more comfortable with 'dreamy', 'melody' and 'intelligence' filled music which Dream Theater has nearly conquered in the last 10 years or so.<br />Yet, this album ROCKS!
6305657947|5.0|What can I say... all of us approaching 40 and past just love seeing these super intelligent, sly, crafty, cut from the same cloth man  and women cross wits and dares. The romance ...ahhhhh...really nice and sensual. Love the story line. Can't tell you how many of us watch this just abt every month. Elegant, hi-end living, beautiful people who are self made AND NOT 20 YEARS OLD!!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I absolutely loved Josh Groban's first CD, but this one is even better.  He really seems more comfortable expressing himself through his voice and sings with so much more feeling, especially on \\"Si Volvieras a Mi.\\"  Beautiful songs, all of them.  He gives \\"Caruso\\" a great turn, as well as \\"Remember When it Rained,\\" a song he both wrote and plays piano on.  I don't think any Josh Groban fan will be disappointed with this CD.
B0000TB014|3.0|&quot;Number Ones&quot; was good but lacked a little in being creative.  &quot;HIStory on Film vol II&quot; was incredible and so was &quot;Dangerous the Short Films.&quot;   However on this one there are no special live performances, commercials, or interviews.  Compared to the rest of the DVD world it was just missing a few things.  Plus you don't get the 14 minute video of &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, the long unedited version of &quot;Black or White&quot;, and I don't like the fast paced version &quot;Smooth Criminal.&quot;  If you are a big fan or would like to see some of his newer videos I would buy this DVD.  Although if you want a good DVD on Michael Jackson I would purchase &quot;HIStory on Film vol II.&quot;  I only bought it so I could get the last two videos and have easy access to each video instead of fast forwarding to them on the tapes I already own
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Didn't think it was possible to improve on the original. Apparenly, it was very possible. This movie kicks butt! Exciting, funny, moving, great music, wonderful cast...it's got all the elements of a 5-star flick. The sequel expands on the intricacies of the characters, while still maintaining an exciting pace. I swear, it's almost as bad as Speed when it comes to having too many climaxes!!! LOL
0060935456|5.0|The story unfolds in the british countryside, a prophetic rabit runt and his brother set out on a brave journey to escape the possible destruction of their warren bringing with them the few they can convince.<br />They encounter other warrens and examine various real world government styles, notably a totalitarian one reminscent of mid twentieth century ones.<br />The story is also about survival, trying as they do to set up their own waren lacking female rabits. Courage, loyalty, cleverness, friendship take them through this in an amazingly suspensful storyline.<br />The backdrop is an invented vocabulary reminiscent of Tolkien's elvish and legends of an ancient rabit hero that inspire them, and amuse us.<br />A masterpiece.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD performance shows Shania Twain at her best! As always, she is full of energy, enthusiasm, and grace. Her repertoire is just the right mix of songs from her hit new album &quot;UP!&quot; and those classics we all love like &quot;From This Moment.&quot; Shania is the essence of a true performer. If you're a Shania fan, you definitely want to get your hands on a copy of this DVD ASAP!
B0000E1WNV|4.0|For as longs as I have been a Springsteen fan (some 20+ years), I have always been craving for Bruce to release a full concert performance.  Although the release of \\"Live in New York City\\" came close to fulfilling the wish, the DVD was still not the full concert experience.<br />With this new release Springsteen finally comes through and releases a full unmodified concert--warts and all.  And what a concert it is.  The energy, the enthusiasm, the focus, and all the other \\"elements\\" of a Springsteen concert are in full force on this 2 1/2 hour, 2 disc DVD set.  From the first notes of \\"The Rising\\" to the final encore of \\"Thunder Road,\\" Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band power through an impressive set list and maintain an intestity unequaled in today's rock concerts.  If you haven't experienced Bruce in concert, this is as close as you can get it.  But it isn't all perfection either, Springsteen even allows his onstage \\"mistakes\\" to make there way onto this set, creating an even more intimate and live concert experience.  Bravo for letting the show stand on its own without having to modify in the cutting room.<br />The video is once again directed by \\"Live in New York City's\\" Chris Hilson, who manages to pefectly capture Springsteen's performance.  Unlike a lot of video concerts, Hilson lets the songs (and the performance) guide the cutting and camera choices.  Though I found some of the editing and camera choices to be lacking on a few of the songs, overall this is a surprisingly well done production.  The PCM audio is somewhat bland while the 5.1 Dolby Digital audio really opens up and provides the full sound of the band while not minimizing the audience's participation. If you don't have a 5.1 decoder, chances are you'll find the audio more than lacking.<br />Aside from the concert video, there is an all to brief documentary \\"Drop The Needle and Pray\\" that offers snippets of interviews with the band and a bevy of video clips.  [Side note here: Why do all the documentaries included on DVDs always contain mostly clips of the film/video you just watched?  If I just watched the movie, I don't want to see a whole host of scenes and moments repeated ad naseum just to fill out a running time!] There is also a montage of concert highlights accompanied by the band's rendition of \\"Diddy Wah Diddy\\".  The extras are nice, but nothing to rave about.<br />All in all, this is an excellent DVD.  However, the 4 star ratings is due to the enourmous amount of complaints about the second disc being defective.  I have 4 players at my home (1 professional and 3 cheapos) and the disc plays on only half the players.  Sony has a lot of explaining to do on this one.  So if you do get this set, be prepared to have the second disc not work in your player.  (Perhaps a more apt title for the disc would have been \\"Drop The Laser and Pray\\"?)documentaries included on DVDs always contain mostly clips of the film/video you just watched?

B0000AQS6R|5.0|Chevy Chase is back again, to keep us laughing through the holidays! I have never seen this movie, wasnt always a fan of Chevy Chase, but during the holidays i ended up seeing it with my family.  I absolutly loved it!  Everything in this movie you can laugh about!  Chevy Chase is a typical man in the movie, needs to have everything perfect, but with his luck, everything goes bad...and its hysterical!  This is the best movie to watch around the holidays with your family.  I HIGHLY reccomend this movie!!!!  Now, its tradition to watch this movie every year!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I am a fan of Harrison and Clapton; so, I was afraid that this concert dvd would disappoint me in not meeting my high expectations... No problem. The performances of the artists assembled for this tribute were heart-felt and well rehearsed. It was never \\"sappy\\" and always genuine. So many of these tributes have been sloppy and ill prepared, but this was a sterling exception. My only critisism is that I would have enjoyed seeing more interviews; although, the ones on disc 2, theatrical version, were very good. Harrison's band mates were all excellent. Jeff Lynne is a fabulous talent! The Ravi Shankar portion was so much better than I thought it would be. The Monty Python bunch were hilarious. I had not heard/seen Sam and Jools prior to this, and I was blown away by Sam's (Brown) voice. And speaking of voice - Paul McCartney was in very fine form for this show. Clapton was \\"journeyman\\" in his musical performances (\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is among my all time favorites), but it was his performance in the role as \\"musical director\\" for this show that made this Concert for George tribute dvd a \\"must have\\" for any fan... Deserves a Grammy nomination.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Universal has decided to shove advertisements down our throats.  Viewers CANNOT skip past the advertisements.  You cannot skip to the DVD menu/title, nor can you jump to any chapters until the long previews have been completed.  This is insane.  Boycott this DVD.
0440180295|5.0|The title Slaughterhouse Five, sounds like a cheesy horror movie, but you could never guess this story involves World War II, an American soldier, and time travel to a out of this world planet named Tralfalmadore. Slaughterhouse Five is a fiction novel based on historical fact. The life story of the main character, Billy Pilgrim, unfolds throughout flashbacks and brief flash-forwards.  Billy is a clumsy American soldier in World War II who becomes separated from his unit. He moves along with three other American soldiers, until they are captured by the Germans. They are then taken to the doomed city of Dresden, Germany and held captive in the slaughterhouses. Billy was in \\"slaughterhouse number five,\\" where the novel gets its name. A week after their capture, Dresden is bombed by the Americans and the city is completely destroyed, but Billy survives physically, but not mentally. Due to the effects of the terrible war, Billy's mind has been seriously altered. He claims to have visited a distant planet called Tralfalmadore, in the fourth dimension. As result of these visits, Billy is now able to travel through time. It is clear Billy Pilgrim is a very changed man from the effects of the war, but it is up to you the reader to decide whether Billy has simply gone insane, or whether he has been day dreaming the whole time.  This novel is a great mix of historical fact and far off fiction, with a light touch of science fiction and a lot of twisted humor. The author, Vonnegut was an American soldier held prisoner in the Dresden slaughterhouses during World War II, so the descriptions are truthfully vivid. The only bad thing is that the time travel makes the story hard to follow but, after reading it you will have a different picture of what a war is like and what it can do to you physically and mentally.
0375414053|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book for my book club, and really tried to like it, but ultimately was disappointed.  I was expecting a strong role-model character in a story told with \\"tenderness and humor,\\" which was exactly what I needed after having finished reading some \\"heavy\\" literary fiction.  I really wanted to sympathize with the main character, Kate Reddy (or \\"K8,\\" as she annoying signs her e-mails), but found her to be a bit unlikable - how many working women today have the option to leave their jobs, as Kate considers?  In this sense, I found her to be hard to identify with.  The fact that there are some good one-liners that working women (with or without children) could perhaps use as \\"slogans\\" in the workplace, in no way makes up for the lack of likable characters and weak plot.  When there appears to be some semblance of a story building, the reader is then suddenly swept back into another underdeveloped plot line, which makes one even more frustrated.  I would have left this book unfinished if were not for the fact that I kept hoping it would improve (and was continually teased into thinking it would).  Despite the positive reviews you may see, please do not bother to read this book unless you like disappointment!
0671027344|3.0|This book was a joy to read. It is easy to follow and has many interesting details. I would say the only thing that is odd about this selection is the format it is written; which is a diary type. The one good thing about that is the fact that it keeps the book moving at a fast pace with the shorter entries. The basic theme of the book is about how high school life can be in the modern day. The author himself is a new author and i believe that his writting skills can and will develope more. But all in all it was a great book that i do recommend to anybody, especially teenagers.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Hmmm. Difficult one this. Yes, I'm a lifelong fan of DT,and they are my favourite band, so I'm coming at this from what I hope is an informed background. But 'Train of Thought'has provided me with a dilemma. Why? Well, it is, without doubt, the heaviest and most 'metal' album they've produced to date. So far, so good, as I also love Metallica, Pantera etc. But after many listens to 'Train..' I just can't get overly excited about it -and I can't quite put my finger on exactly why this should be. It's production is great, the playing & musicianship is stunning (as always), and it has genuinely sublime moments; but as a whole it seems, to me, to lack some of the 'magic' that previous DT albums have had, that secret ingredient that made Images & Words, Awake & particularly Scenes From a Memory some of the best prog / metal albums ever made. Worryingly, it also appears to be following a trend - 'Six Degrees...' the last album, was frankly patchy, and 'Train...' follows this pattern. Many of the riffs sound like re-hashed DT songs, and whilst they are perfectly within their rights to self-plagiarise, this is a first for a band that pride themselves on originality. They should have taken a year off, rather than writing an album in three weeks (fact)! I just hope that they don't 'do a Metallica' and not be able to recover from their masterpiece(Dream Theater's 'Scenes from a Memory' is the equivalent of Metallica's 'Black Album', in my humble opinion). However, it's still better than most stuff churned out by younger, more trendy bands, and my advice is if you like your music heavy and have never tried Dream Theater, this is the album for you.
B000003TA4|5.0|IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS BY THE pearl jam Fans. This album is simply the greatest. Every track is awesome in it's own way. You won't find yourself skipping any tracks on this one. Nirvana at their best which was simply better than anyone!!!!<br />PS. if Nirvama are so bad why are you pearl jam losers wasting your time here.
B000002UAX|5.0|Everyone who gave this Album 5 or 4 stars, ignore this (You are the true music fans).  <br />This post is directed towards the people who gave The White Album 1 or 2 stars.  You guys wouldn't know amazing music if it was printed on the album.  Ok..Let's do the math...88% of everyone who has reviewed this CD has LOVED IT.  That is only the people who gave it 5 or 4 stars.  I challenge you to try and find another CD that has that percentage towards it.  <br />I read one post that said that The Beatles were dumb to put out a double CD, that bands like Smash mouth and SugerRay are smart to only put out 8 songs on a CD.  You want to hear the truth??  Smashmouth and Sugar Ray and any other band is just AFRAID to put out a Double disk.  <br />Take it from me and the other 88% of us who reviewed this.  This is the best Beatle Album that you can buy.
B000002UAR|5.0|If you only own one Beatle album, it should be this one. It is still the first thing I try any new audio equipment out with. The hits, Yellow Submarine and Eleanor Rigby, are my least favorite tracks. You can see the seperate paths developing as Paul keeps going pop, John gets more introspective, and George heads East. Also, George penned three of the tunes, suggesting that competition was stirring well before the \\"White\\" album. Some consider \\"Rubber Soul\\" Their best, others say \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". \\"Revolver\\" still turns me on.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|This is a truly terrific caper movie, one that works well by both showcasing the emerging star power of both Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron and also having a terrific storyline. It is also a smart and well-photographed movie that proves the old adage of depending on the use of a great story and then embellishing on it with all the bells and whistles. The plot is as believable as anything can be that posits the existence of people so smart, so devious, and so daring as to be able to do some of the things that are done here. Yet the qualms about believability quickly fade with each nosiy and exciting revving up of the action, which is well choreographed, full of pyrotechnics, and absolutely fresh and new, adding to the charm of the movie.<br />The cast adds immeasurably to the charm of the movie, with Donald Sutherland, Ed Norton, and several notable others lending both credence and a certain gritty feel to this tale about life on the margins, on the far side of the law. I also got the impression that given the box office success of this film; much of the crew may be back to thrill us again in an inevitable sequel. I am up for it. After all, given the aplomb and cool they displayed in driving a trio of Metros through the streets, sewers, and tunnels of Los Angeles at rush hour, and added into this mix was a certain level of style and intelligence often missing in such caper flicks, it would be fun to consider a series of such films. Compared to other recent offerings at the theater, which have by and large been disappointing affairs indeed, it would be a relief to consider more caper flicks like this. Enjoy!
B00005JLEU|5.0|When you allow your imagination free reign the creation that comes from it can be startling and so bizarre that it takes time for your brain to realign itself to the created reality.  \\"Spirited Away\\" is a fantastic vision of a world close to ours, and yet invisible to our eye, reached only by a portal lost and forgotten.  Spirits served by a host of creatures, including witches, all out to make a living, inhabit this world.  This world has its own set of rules and past, with sufficient familiarity with our world that you are not completely lost.<br />Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new home.  As with many children her age, Chihiro is not especially happy to be moving away from her friends and the home she has always known.  When her father takes a wrong turn and encounters a mysterious building in the deep woods, Chihiro is immediately afraid and tries to warn her parents that they should turn around.  Her father and mother press on through the building, believing they have entered an abandoned theme park.  When they enter an area filled with restaurants and discover no one around, they pig out to the point where they pork out.<br />As night falls, Chihiro discovers that she is trapped in this world.  The intervention of Haku saves her life and enables her to survive in this new world.  As Chihiro befriends those she encounters a number of characters in this world come to love and help her in her goal of turning her parents back to people and escaping back to the world she knows.<br />The world Hiyao Miyazaki has created is a fantastic alternate reality.  There are demons that eat beings whole.  There are bizarre spirit creatures whose purpose can not be guessed, and yet intuitively you have some vague idea of what that purpose might be.  There are talking frogs and a giant baby.  There are bouncing heads with minimal intelligence.  There is an incredible, beautiful and fragile dragon.  There is a pair of witches, sisters, whose motivations are typically difficult to understand.<br />The vision of this movie ranks with the best animation I have ever seen.  This movie became the highest grossing film in Japanese history, and for good reason.  Few movies have attempted and been successful at achieving the scope of this movie.  A required film for fantasy film buffs.ficult to understand.<br />The vision of this movie ranks with the best animation I have ever seen.

B00009ATIX|2.0|Take the boredom and disconnection of  \\"2001\\" and combine it with the intelligence of  \\"The Cell\\" and you get a movie that will put you to sleep wondering what on earth is happening.  How did George keep a straight face?  What sort of movie did he think this would end up being edited into?  So many questions, so little time.  In honesty, this is an all time fizzer.  Maybe it is trying to be intelligent, or maybe I'm just being unfair, but whatever is happening here doesn't end happily for anyone.
B0000TB03W|4.0|first i want to say shania is amazing. second this dvd is awesome. anyone who wants to truely be entertained must get thisdvd. it has shania performing live all of her hits 22 in all. shania just keeps belting out hit after hit. she keeps you entertained the whole time .
B00008S2VG|1.0|I'm sorry to say that this is the worst album I have ever listened to. I'm a a big fan of Madonna and have been since I was 8 years old. I was very disappointed with this album. The songs are all awful! They all sound the same and have no beat. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Madonna can do better. Save your money.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Unlike many in this forum, I was quite dissapointed with the theatrical release of the Two Towers. While the cinematography was quite stunning, the first half of the movie felt quite rushed and the changes Jackson, et al, made in the story was quite annoying and unnecessary.<br />Enter the extended version! Both of my complaints with the theatrical version have been answered. With the extra material, the movie no longer feels rushed. And, with the extra explanation, the alterations are not annoying, as they finally make sense.<br />Unlike the first movie, there are a few flaws in the extension. The added elven rope and extended Taming of Smeagol scenes feel tacked on. This is due more to the cinematographic differences (rainy, night time versus day) than illogical progression, but the placing of the additions was enough to keep me from losing myself in the story. Fortunately, these scenes are short and near the beginning. <br />The second flaw is far more subtle. As one of the added scenes merges into older content, the entire sound track goes blank for about a second, highlighting the fact that there is new content. As this flaw happens in the change of a scene, it may be a DVD flaw that is not present in the film. Engrossed in the film at the time, it was jarring to me.<br />Things to really like:<br />* The hobbit's escape from capture flows.<BR>* The Ent's decision to go to war feels natural, not forced.<BR>* Theoden's human side shows quite a bit more<BR>* You better understand the nature of Aragorn, as one of the last of the Dúnedain. While this still does not explain his near superman quality (being blown hundreds of feet in the air and getting back up to fight), it at least adds a level of plausibility.<BR>* The elves' aid at Helm's Deep makes more sense.<BR>* Faramir's character begins to shine, which will be more important in Return of the King.<BR>* A crucial set up for ROTK is set up with Merry and Pippin (will not spoil for those who have not read thebooks).<br />In addition, there are some fun scenes that many avid LOTR fans have been waiting for, like the Ent Draft scene. While this does not necessarily add much to the story line, the added scenes do give a bit more depth to the characters.<br />Much like the Fellowship extended, the extra material lacks a certain amount of production quality. The material is excellent, however, for those who want to know more about both the original story and the film. <br />I am torn with 4 and 5 stars with this review and wish I could give 4.5. While I am definitely a fan, there are a couple of flaws that make it hard for me to give it a perfect score.
B00005JMFR|2.0|well, that certainly wasn't as good as expected. Revolutions is in effect just one long action sequence. Just as Reloaded had a lot of mumbo-jumbo packed in between with action, Revolutions has a whole lot of action with just a few scenes of mumbo-jumbo. The mumbo-jumbo lines fall predictably to enigmas like the oracle, Agent Smith, Morpheus and the Frenchman.<BR>In Revolutions, the Sentinel army that was digging to Zion in Reloaded, reaches the human city and there follows a heroic battle. Neo and Trinity have other fish to fry and do not get much air time due to the metal flying in Zion.<br />Revolutions fails as an ending because there is no decline from tension. I don't want to spoil any secrets, but the good are not shown to be rewarded, the evil is not eliminated, in fact it is not clear what will happen to the Matrix and Zion. It is as if the directors went \\"Oops, its two hours long already, just cut it off, wherever it is.\\" The Oracle's actions are never fully explained, or why Agent Smith has corrupted even beyond the control of the Architect. It's difficult for me to elaborate without letting some cats out of the bag. To put it succintly, the Wachowski brothers seem to be leaving the way clear for a fourth movie.<br />On the positive side however, you can depend on Revolutions for what has already been effectively delivered in the first two movies: plenty of CGI action that keeps up the pace and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The battle is fantastic and the Sentinel invasion truly conveys fear and awe. Apart from the APCs moving like metallized gorillas, the human defence is breathtaking. The much acclaimed showdown between Neo and Smith too is very well brought out. Thankfully, the directors do not repeat what they did in Reloaded and break into bullet-time continously and seemingly just for the heck of it. Instead, the slower shots are well-timed and exciting.<br />So the overall verdict is that Revolutions is good as a movie by itself but fails asthe ending to a trilogy.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I purchased the DVD and it is great.If you have never seen Shania live this DVD will make you want to go to a concert.It makes you feel as if you're at the show.<BR>With Christmas UP this will make any Shania fan happy.
B0000DJE9R|1.0|I was hoping this album would have some &quot;other&quot; greatest hits by Jackson.  But looking at the playlist, most of these are available on his HIStory album that came out years ago, and the others are not particularly famous &quot;hits&quot;.<br />C'mon, Michael, this is stupid.  Why should we buy something that's basically an inferior clone of HIStory?  At least both discs in HIStory have music on them.  The 2nd CD in this new set is just videos of the songs on the 1st disc.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I liked the theatrical version of &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; That being said, the Extended Edition is definitely a stronger, more consistent film. It tightens up so many of the loose ends, and gave more reason for some of the changes made from the books. From Eowyn's heartfelt singing at Theodred's funeral procession to Merry and Pippin's extended roles to Faramir's siginificantly more defined character, the new scenes add to the story and to the character development dramatically. The plot flows better in general, and my wife's comment upon seeing the new material was &quot;It makes sense now!&quot; That sums it up pretty well.<br />The DVD extras (on Discs 3 and 4) live up to the high standard set by the Extended Edition of &quot;Fellowship of the Ring.&quot; We get to see some of the technical wizardry in the creation of Gollum, and we get insights into the massive amounts of creative energy expended on crafting this grand film, including the reasoning behind changing key elements of the books.  What is abundantly clear in each presentation is that everyone involved in making these films is passionately devoted to doing it well, ad no decisions were made haphazardly. It's so rare to find DVD extras that live up to the film they accompany, but the extras on the set definitely do so admirably. And be sure to keep your eyes open for a couple of great easter eggs!<br />When it comes to the films themselves, &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was different. The theatrical release was very good, and the Extended Edition was very good. Some of the individual scenes in the &quot;Fellowship&quot; Extended Edition were cut better, but overall I like both versions equally, for different reasons. For &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; it really seems like the Extended Edition is the better film. Diehard Tolkien fans or movie fans who never read the books should both enjoy the Extended Edition more.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's 1997 groundbreaking masterpiece, 'OK Computer', broke many barriers on how music should be listened to...    Radiohead forced people to listen to music in a different way & because of that, this album stands as a spit in the face of all radio-friendly poppy mtv B.S. - Any album that pulls that off is worthy of high recognition, which is why this album is not over rated, it had a serious impact on people in general, not just the world of music    I came here reading reviews for this album, & i remember back when this album was at 5 stars.... What's this? 4 1/2? No, no, no no no no no.... this will never do    & for you people who think Radiohead is self-important pompous college boy rock.... pull your head out of your....    If it's because so many people act smarter after hearing this album in the eyes of other people, its because it IS albums like this that make people smarter, literally - When you learn to use your brain in a different way & make it adjust to something it isnt used to, you are, technically, becoming smarter - its just like getting experience, experience makes you smarter... Im not trying to sound smart, im just stating a fact...    1) Airbag - A nice way to kick off the album with some great lyrics, \\"In an intersteller blast, im back to save the universe\\"    2) Paranoid Android - This song could quite possibly have more layers to it than any other song ever written by anyone, itll take a few listens to know where the song ends & the next song begins, just because this song sounds like 3-4 songs in 1    3) Homesick Alien - \\"Watch your feet, for cracks in the pavement\\" (who doesnt?)    4) Exit Music - Powerful.. slow, acoustic at first, building in energy    5) Let Down - The best & most emotional song off the album, the first time i heard this song, i felt like i was walking on squares floating in space - One of the greatest songs ever made    6) Karma Police - At this point you're convinced this album just keeps getting better & better8) Electioneering - Very rocky, i like it, \\"i go forward, you go backward, somewhere we will meet\\" - Itll make sense when you think about it, just not the first time you think about it    9) Climbing Up the Walls - It's hard to understand the lyrics... but the spooky... insane atmosphere will stick in your head for hours afterwards, a creepy song & one of the best songs off the album, probably the 2nd best    10) No Surprises - A rather sad song with a happy melody about the collaspe of \\"white picket fence\\" type family    11) Lucky - A very depressing song... waking up, every day life... thinking, \\"maybe todays the day something good will finally happen to me\\"    12) The Tourist - \\"It barks at no one else but me, like its seen a ghost\\".... those lyrics pretty much sum up the entire feel of \\"OK Computer\\"    PLEASE HELP RAISE THIS ALBUM TO 5 STARS AGAIN! Because it truly is one of the most innovative, interesting, & emotional albums ever created, they made a hardcore fan out of me...    P.S. (It wouldn't hurt to listen to Pearl Jam either)
B00005NTJM|5.0|Although I own the original vinyl album, this remastered version adds some real bonuses. The recording is crisp, and the extra bonus tracks, such as &quot;One for John Gee,&quot; &quot;Love Story,&quot; and &quot;Christmas Song,&quot; add to the album. <BR>Given the lyrics to &quot;Christmas Song,&quot; it would have worked as well on &quot;Aqualung.&quot; &quot;Song for Jeffrey&quot; hints at the renaissance influence of their latter albums. All in all, a great jazz/rock/blues album.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Thriller was a mega success that no one could defeat, neither Elvis or the Beatles. It was an album that sold over 60 million records and released 7 top ten hits. It was the biggest selling album of all time and released classics that would launch jackson as the king of pop.<br />When 1987 came, he release BAD. It sold many copies but many critics slammed it saying that it could not follow Thriller. Bad has sold 34 million copies worldwide today. <br />I feel that this cd is much more worth buying than thriller for many reasons. This cd has more rock, pop and soul combined than thriller did. of course thriller is one of my favorites, but some ballads were rather corny like PYT. <br />This album is probably my favorite album from jackson, and probably many other people's too.  It released 5 # 1 hits(a record) and 8 top ten hits. <br />Here is what i have to say:<br />BAD- a wonderful classic song that never gets annoying<br />The Way you Make me Feel- this is the second best song on the album. it is very catchy and a great dance song.<br />Speed Demon- this song is full of soul! i love his voice<br />Liberian Girl- this is a romantic ballad though it is my least favorite on the album<br />Just Good Friends- This is a wonderful duet with Stevie wonder! I love it<br />Another Part of me- one of the best songs to be performed on stage!<br />man in the mirror- absolutely the best song! a wonderful song full of emotion. makes me cry!<br />i just can't stop loving you- great song! my wifes favorite!<br />dirty diana- the best rock song in history!<br />Smooth criminal- i love this song! the video is great also(what a genius mj is)<br />Leave me alone- this is one of his best and i'm dissapointed it's not one of his greatest hits!<br />streetwalker- this should have been included instead of liberian girl<br />i want to make this clear- michael jackson is innocent of all charges brought against him. he was a friend of the boy who accused him who was a cancer survivor. michael payed the boy's debts and bought the family a house. he decided not to pay anymore! this was a setup and i love you michael! the biggest selling artist in the history of music.!
B00005ASHM|5.0|While many point to Rubber Soul or Revolver as pivot albums for popular music, experienced musicians understand that Pet Sounds raised the bar and set the standard.  Songwriting, production, performance - it's all here.  From Wouldn't It Be Nice to Caroline No, it's great.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Yes Ms.Spears is back and better the ever her new cd is off the chain. There's a song for everybody from pop,r&amp;b,rap. <br />Her new album show off here vocals finaly.So for all you people that say she can't sing look at Chrisina can we say same key. <br />But moving on I give this album 10 out 5 because its feels like you or against the music which makes you outrageous and makes you think you got that boom boom making you want someone to breathe on you and havin you dancing to the early mornin'.<br />Everytime you play this cd because Britney Got the hook up.
B000002UB3|3.0|&quot;Abbey Road made bands like Led Zeppelin possible&quot;.  Oh, please.  <br />First of all, Led Zeppelin's debut was virtually simultaneous with Abbey Road.  Second, Zep hardly imitated the lightweight fare of Maxwell's Silver Hammer or Octopuses Garden.  <br />This is a good album, especially compared to the slump of Sgt. Pepper or Rubber Soul, but it wasn't earthbreaking.  3 stars.
B0000E1WNV|2.0|As a SPRINGSTEEN Concert goer and fan since his days of playing the Stone Pony. I have to say this is one of the most UNINSPIRED<br />BRUCE concerts ever on tape or record. Funny, for someone who sings &quot;Born in the USA&quot; he would choose a concert from of all places, BARCELONA,SPAIN ! What's worse is there is a tease of his concerts in Fenway Park ,BOSTON on the DVD. That small bit of footage is better than the entire BARCELONA concert.<br />At least it shows an inspired BRUCE having fun. Instead of just going through the motions for an audience who doesn't appreciate him the way those of us BORN IN THE USA do ! Think about it, for what audience do you think BRUCE is more pumped up for ?<br />Barcelona, Spain , Or Fenway Park, Boston in October!<br />The SOUND on this DVD is also not that great. Why is it concert DVDs ,never have closed captions or subtitles? It would be fun<br />to do a Karaoke like sing-along if the dvd had subtitles or closed captions. Also since BRUCE speaks Spanish alot during this concert,and this DVD will probably be relased in foreign countries, it gives another reason for the use of subtitles.<br />The set list is disorganized ,but has some gems. If you like BRUCE unplugged, alone at the piano, Then you will enjoy disk two. Oh yes,DISK Two is defective. I had to press STOP and PLAY<br />just to start it. I was Unable to use the MENU on disk two to get to the sound options or set playlist.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The additional forty minutes makes the movie much less choppy and explains a lot of things.  Faramir, for example, who I thought was a rather weak character in the original version makes a lot more sense.  <br />The extras provided on this DVD set are outstanding as well.  I really enjoyed watching how Gollum was actually done and Peter Jackson and the writers explaining their reasons for adapting the book the way they did.<br />In all, a great entertainment value.  After I watch the extended editions and the extras on them, I can't help but feel that this adaption of Tolkien was a true work of love by its creators and will not be equalled again in my lifetime.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Train of Thought would have appealed to me immensely perhaps a year, two years ago. The music is technically brilliant: the guitarist John Petrucci can play impossibly fast, the drummer Mike Portnoy is amongst the drumming elite. The fact that this material has rather complex music, with shifting time signatures, insanely fast riffs proves that Dream Theater is musically the leaders in the prog/metal field. <br />However, i've discovered progressive rock music in the period since &quot;Six Degrees of Seperation&quot; came out, and i've found a larger, more diverse world of music. For those of you unfamiliar with true progressive music, I urge you to take a step foward by listening to the Transatlantic album &quot;SMPTE&quot;, which DT drummer Mike Portnoy was a part of. The music is deep, heavy, grand, epic, emotional and moving, but without having to display ridiculous amounts of technical, musical feats. By blending melodic and rhythmic aspects of sound together, by creating music that is challenging but not overwhelming: that is progressive music. Dream Theater just seems to want to prove that they can rock harder and play faster than anyone else.<br />The songs are fine, however. If you like classic metal, such as Diamond Head, Metallica and Iron Maiden, Dream Theater will definetly be your thing. I've seen this new album unfavorably compared to 'nu-metal', yet DT seems to be moving backward, rather than forward. Vocally, James LaBrie has more in common with the 80's metal groups, which in my opinion has managed to stifle any further success that the band has hoped to achieve. 'Nu-metal' is heavy, but not intense, and the vocalists sing in lower ranges. <br />Perhaps my biggest issue with the album is the general lack of diversity. Although songs like &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; have quite touching lyrics and some elements of melody, the album as a whole seems somewhat overwhelming, angry, and personal. For those listeners who expect for DT to expand on the melodic and emotional progress made on tunes from their last album such as &quot;Blind Faith&quot; and &quot;Solitary Shell&quot; may be dissapointed. <br />This is a head-banging album; this is music that you will want in a 'metal mood'. I realize that many listeners are fine with this, that a lot of people listen to ONLY metal, but I need something a little more than this. I respect that the band spent a lot of time producing this work, and I appreciate that they aren't willing to re-create the same music over and over. However, it seems that instead of progressing and expanding on the themes and musical aspects of their previous works, Dream Theater has chosen to just turn up and 'rock out'. If your'e looking to do the same, this is your album.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|IN THE ZONE is a world away from her first cd BABY ONE MORE TIME and she has done a great job adopting new sounds...if you are a die-hard bubble-gum pop fan, then this cd will probably be a rude awakening...but for those like me who are growing up w/ britney...she hits the spot w/ \\"early mornin,\\" the sexy reggae beat in \\"the hook up,\\" and the hot hip hop sound in \\"I've got that boom boom.\\" MY FAVORITE BRITNEY ALBUM YET!

B0000TB03W|5.0|When I first learned that I would be unable to attend the concert in Chicago and second I would be unable to watch the special on NBC, I assured myself that I didn't miss it because it would eventually come out on DVD. Well, this was worth the wait! In addition to admiring Shania's talent in song writing, she does a wonderful job performing on the stage and encouraging fan interaction. It was great when she brought kids on the stage to sing I'm Gonna Getcha Good! One of the best songs on the DVD is When You Kiss Me because of the special surprise on stage before Shania performs this song. The concert is a blend of songs from the new album and hits from Come On Over and The Woman In Me. I'm a little disappointed that When and Come On Over didn't make it into the concert, but I am very satisfied that Shania included Rock This Country and Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under? I will probably watch parts of this DVD every day to keep myself in a good mood. I recommend this DVD to anybody that likes music. I love Shania Twain!
B00005AQGJ|5.0|When someone asks you what is the best Rap CD ever you prolly say the the newest CD that you got or downloaded. But think deeper and if your the true Rap fan then you know The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory is prolly the top rap CD of all time. All eyez on me is 2pac's 2nd best CD but you could put it in front because it is a double disc. All the songs on here and really deep and show the best side of tupac ever. Hail Mary is a classic as is bomb first. This is a rare Cd where you can listen to every song and not skip songs. All in all this is a great CD. This is a true piece of history, but the question is still up, is this the best rap CD of all time, Nas's Illmatic is a sicc CD, but there is a CD not a lot of people know about and that is, Brotha Lynch Hung Season Of Da Siccness which is a tie with tupacs 7 day theory CD. Check out the Season of da Siccness and you will be blown away, in my oppinion BLH is the best rapper out period, he is underground, but get his CD off amazon right now, what are you waiting for go and get it
B00004U45G|5.0|Flat out joy.  I've been a Led Zeppelin fan since the earliest days.  Although The Crowes didn't 'get creative' and play around with the arrangements, the very fact that they were so true to all the arrangements, lending instrumental strength and power behind music that was already great and has stood the test of time.  I almost jumped out of my skin listening to both of these disks.  Yay!  Thanks Black Crowes.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Just to set the record straight, this new album isn't really \\"as nature intended\\".  It features countless edits and digital enhancing, thus the \\"right there in the studio 'raw' feel\\" isn't really present.  The marketing is just that -- marketing.  That's not to say it doesn't have value, however.  Now normally I view track-by-track reviews as frivolous, but in this case, I think it really is necesary.  Get Back--very crisp, but vocals sound a bit too forward.  This track suffers from a problem that some others do in the respect that the recording sounds almost \\"otherworldly\\", as its so crisp and against a silent background it almost sounds as if it was recorded on the moon.  This is also a shorter version, missing it's coda found on the original LIB.  One of the weaker remixes on LIBN.  6/10  Dig a Pony--also crisp, but vocals seem more balanced.  Not much different from standard version.  Nice sounding mix, clean guitars.  8/10  For You Blue--also not very different from standard version.  Acoustic guitar jumps out at you more.  Also 8/10  The Long and Winding Road--different from LIB take as it lacks the overdubbed orchestration, obviously, but also different from Anthology 3 version as it is a different take.  Vocals sound strange, not very natural.  Definitely not a \\"raw\\" feel to this, even though it doesn't have the overdubs.  7/10  Two Of Us--one of the nicest mixes on the album.  Vocals are nice, John's voice is really nice to hear clear and upfront.  Paul's acoustic work also stands out.  Well-balanced mix...one of the nicest improvements.  9/10  I've Got a Feeling--interesting.  VERY crisp, perhaps a bit too crisp for this rough & tough rock song.  Vocals are too upfront also.  The mix is just too slick for a song like this.  HOWEVER, it sounds better as the song progresses, especially during the \\"Everybody had a hard year....\\" part.  An up and down mix.  8/10  One After 909--Also very slick for a song like this.  Vocals a bit too upfront again.  Billy's keyboards really stand out here, excellent mixing work.  It shows how essential he is to this mediocre song overall.  8/10  Don't Let Me Down--a combination of takes.  Sounds very nice, vocals are mixed a little better than some others it seems.  It does occasionally suffer from sounding like it was recorded on the moon, as it's a rooftop take with no background noise.  Once again Billy's keyboards shines.  Excellent addition to the album, as it should have been on it in the first place, it belongs here.  9/10  I Me Mine--never a favorite song of mine, but the mix sounds nice.  Electric guitar sounds good and sharp, and George's vocals are crystal clear.  Shows how beautiful a voice he really has.  8/10  Across The Universe--hands down, the highlight of the album.  Just John and his acoustic guitar, it truly is a standout track.  Different from previously released versions, without choirs and what not, and also different from the sped-up wildlife mix.  Also features an odd echo fadeout, but that doesn't distract from the overall beauty of the song. My new favorite version of this John classic.  10/10  Let It Be--the all-familar title track sounds quite good despite its faults.  I think the piano is mixed too low, and vocals too high, first off.  Also, the background vocals sound phony, killing the raw feel it could have.  They sound chorus-like, instead of just John and George.  This track is a complicated edit of movie/album takes, going back and forth.  Sounds crisp and clear, and Ringo's drums show up better also.  I am fond of the different guitar solo, as it's more laid back than the album version (though I love both).  Nice overall.  8/10  Fly On The Wall Bonus Disc--very strange montage of clips from the original Get Back sessions, and very aimless to say the least.  It's also programmed on one track, about 20 minutes long.  Good for a one time listen, and not much else.  At least they don't charge extra for it.  4/10  This album is very nice, but it does haveit's faults.  Fade outs are way too fast, in an attempt to rid itself of any chatter that might've been heard.  Vocals are mixed too high, and many songs are simply too slick and modern sounding.  This is not truly \\"raw\\" at all.  However, this album is also very good.  It is a half-way mark between the original LIB and the \\"Get Back\\" mix, which is the real \\"raw\\" mix.  LIB has received some unfair treatment over the years -- no, its not Revolver or Pepper and it never will be.  That doesn't mean it's not a great bunch of songs by the greatest ever rock band which still easily knocks the socks off nearly anything else out there.  Definitely pick this one up.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox made a huge mistake when cancelling this show.  It had such potential, and easily could have been the next big show on TV.  It was fun, it was funny, it was creative.  An amazing show that truly did deserve more than what Fox gave it.  I'm certainly among those that think it should be brought back, one of my fav TV shows ever!
B00009TB5G|4.0|MOVIE - 5 STARS; COMPANION DVD'S - 4 STARS<br />*SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**<br />When I first heard that the elves would be at Helm's Deep in the Two Towers, I, like many others, was outraged.  When I saw the completed theatrical release, I realized something.  Helm's Deep would have been a total wash for the world of men if they didn't have good archers on that battlement.  The difference in the media of print and film makes some changes necessary.  Of course it reads well without the elves, but when one actually sees that battle, the viewer's perspective is necessarily changed.<br />A lot of that happens with the new and extended scenes in this DVD set.  Some of it is extremely unnecessary for the telling of the story, but relates the tale in different perspectives.  For instance, the added scene between Eowyn and Aragorn gives you Aragorn's age and reminds the viewer that he is not of the normal race of men.  Reading the book, the reader cannot forget this unless they put the book down for a year.  I must say, Viggo Mortensen has aged well.<br />The companion dvds are a bit of a disappointment.  The same interviews and statements are repeated throughout.  There is some new info, though.  At least it was new to me.  The guy who trained the stunt persons in swordplay was Erroll Flynn's stunt double.  The guy looks amazing for his age.  I guess foiling and swordplay keep one in shape.<br />One really great thing -- the Easter Egg on this dvd set is in the same place as on the FOTR dvd.  Go to select a scene on the first dvd.  Go to the last scene and hit &quot;down&quot; one more time so that &quot;new scene&quot; is highlighted.  Hit &quot;play&quot;.  It's Andy Serkis'/Gollum's acceptance speech at the 2003 MTV movie awards.  I've never laughed so hard in my life.

B0000BWVCM|5.0|'X2: X-Men United' is one of these few films that I can watch over and over again, and the more I see it, the more I fell in love with. A vast improvement from the first film, this one should be called 'X1', since the previous film took a lot of time introducing the characters. What makes 'X2' so special is how these characters come to live on the screen, not just as people dressed in costumes with super abilities, but as human beings. Like ourselves, they have their flaws and insecurities that no super power can compensate. This is the kind of film I really enjoy: character development over visual effects; something that the 'Star Wars' prequels and the last two 'Matrix' movies lack, unfortunately.  <br />Kudos for the very talented cast, even for those with little screen time (nice job, Cyclops), and hats off to Bryan Singer and his crew for bringing a comic book to life the right way, not Ang Lee's way.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|I really hate to say this, but what a disappointment! I have been a Beatles fan for many years and was extremely happy with the Anthology series which provided my ears with great alternative versions of  the classics and not-so classics I have always loved. However upon listening to this latest McCartneyfied version of Let It Be, I can see a clear easy path to the mediocrity supreme that is the band Wings. Aside from the nice raw versions of \\"For You Blue\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\", this disc explores, rather too intimately, the self destruction and alienation that was apparent in their relationship with each other. What we end up with here is a naked exposed underbelly of songs that probably would have ended up on the editing room floor had ... All I can say is, thank goodness the original is still on the shelves...
B0000AR8NK|4.0|What the hell is wrong with everyone! I've read more than one review here BASHING this record, and in particular Bowie himself, as being uninspired, boring, and a has-been. Granted, most of these reviews are poorly written and not very convincing on any level. If fact, it's pretty clear that these people haven't even listened to the album. One completely miserable sounding guy in Pittsburgh actually sounds like David Bowie killed his mother or something. He didn't even review the record! I've never seen so much unwarranted hot air in my life!<br />Anyway, I'm not here to give a track-by-track review. But I will just say that this is a very good Bowie record. Is it breaking new ground? No. Is it him re-inventing himself yet again? Not really. But so what? Why can't he just make a good rock record once in a while? REALITY seems to be a record that takes bits of his past and brings them into the 21st century. I hear elements of the Berlin period here, SCARY MONSTERS, HUNKY DORY, and even a little TIN MACHINE(and yes, I DO like Tin Machine!)There is great songwriting here, great songs, and no, his voice is far from &quot;shot&quot;. That is just plain made up.<br />Hey, I'm not a Bowie apologist. He's done things that I think haven't worked. But I firmly believe that REALITY, over time, will reveal itself to be an exceptional Bowie album, one of his Top 10 (which says a lot when you're competing with the likes of HEROES, LOW, SCARY MONSTERS, STATION TO STATION, ETC.) Then, in 20 years time, the same people bashing it here will be giving it a 5 star review, saying they remember the day this classic came out, yak yak yak. Whatever.
0375713751|4.0|I really enjoyed this books' insights into the life of a working mom.  I was stressed and exhausted while reading; it felt that real.  The internal dialogue going on in this book is excellent and honest!  Personally, I don't know how anyone could live a life like the one portrayed here.<br />I was loving the book until the very end.  I was irritated by the rushed, movie-like, big bang (which really wasn't that much of a bang!) ending.  The author tries to close all the loose ends in the story lines, which I think is ridiculous.  What starts out as a thought-provoking look at the life(s) a working mom has, ends up being a lukewarm re-hash of sticking it to someone.  I fully admire the choice that Kate makes in the end; but I didn't need the final \\"closure\\" that the author tries to make.  It felt weak and contrived and left me disappointed. What mom, stay-at-home or working, has neat and tidy, closed ends anyway?<br />Four stars because the first 80% of the book is a fantastic portrayal of the inner-workings of an over-scheduled woman with no time for her kids, her husband or herself!
B00000IIXH|2.0|It pains me to be critical of Bruce Springsteen, a man whose music has provided me with years of enjoyment, and whose album releases are of consistent high quality... but I have a bone to pick. In the wake of the _Tracks_ box set, it made lots of sense to put some of the highlights out on a single disc, aiming at the more casual fan. It was downright two-faced, however, to withhold two of the most desirable rarites in his catalog (&quot;The Fever&quot;, &quot;The Promise&quot;) deliberately, in the hopes of rooking fans who'd bought the box into buying this disc as well. And record companies wonder why cd burners are so popular(!)... well, let me tell you - if you happen to already own those two songs from elsewhere (through the secondary market, perchance), hang onto 'em, because these aren't the versions you fell in love with, anyway. &quot;The Promise&quot; is a new recording (good, but not great), and &quot;The Fever&quot; has been stripped of its smoky jazz-club ambience and given a really incongruous re-mix (ugh). &quot;Trouble River&quot; isn't even worth mentioning. I suspect manager Jon Landau was the mastermind behind all of this, but since Bruce put his name on it, he gets the rap here.<br />I wish I could call this an isolated incident, but it's starting to look more like a pattern. With the recent release of _The Essential Bruce Springsteen_, Bruce has pulled the trick once again, asking devoted fans to shell out for two discs worth of material they already own, just to get a third disc with a few more rarities (like &quot;Trapped&quot; and &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, both withheld from the _Tracks_ releases). Maybe Bruce needs to take a look at his labelmates from the opposite coast, Pearl Jam (a true fan's band, if such a thing exists anywhere). They have recently put out a beautiful two-disc set of rarities, b-sides, and previously-unheards that is not only well thought-out and generously stuffed, but reasonably priced, to boot (or in this case, to beat the boots). Methinks Bruce could learn a thing or two from those guys.
B0000640SA|1.0|I recently bought this Limited Edition DVD set because I love the film and wanted to watch all the extras that comes with the DVD.<br /><br />When I got the DVD, it was beautifully design. But when it comes time to play it. Horror! Though the DVD was designed to be viewed like a mediacal file, it was a terrible way to navigate through to get to the extra. Disc 1 was pretty easy. One just needs to hit WATCH and the movie will play.<br /><br />Disc 2 was a different story. After hitting an icon that looks like a book, it led me through a series of question. I managed to find the Director's Shooting Script that correspond to the film in multi-angle. It was pretty cool. But that was it.<br /><br />I am still looking to see how I can get to the Original short story, the Trailers and all the extra freebie. But at every turn, all I get was a series of questions that leads to more question. Undoubtably it was fun for the first minute. But very quickly, the frustration sets in. I think the designer forgot that they are designing a DVD that is meant to be watched. What's the point of hidding all the features that no one can find. A bummer...and very disappointing as a DVD.<br /><br />I would give 4.5 stars to the movie but 1 star for the design of the DVD. Save your money and go get the regular edition instead.
B00006BTCA|4.0|This is a fantastic album.  Yes , it is one of the best albums of the past year. My friends(who also work in a record store) and I are actually hopeful that some of the new New York bands can save American music. . .The Strokes, Interpol, The Rapture, Stellastar, etc. . .TOTBL does have some elements of Joy division, but it also has elements of The Smiths and The Fall.  Nobody is completely original, not even Joy Division.  Ian Curtis is dead.  Joy Division hasn't made any new music in over twenty years.  You people should try something new!  As far as the vocals are concerned I think they sound like Mark Smith of The Fall.  But you Joy Division fans probably don't even know who The Fall are!  I do like Joy Division and I do they think they are better than Interpol.  There are only a handful of bands that are better than Joy Division.   Just listen to the samples and if you don't like it then don't buy it.  This is a free country you are allowed to like both Joy Division and Interpol both.  Oh. . .It is obvious that those who are giving one star reviews to this album are also giving negative responses to people who defend this album.  Grow up or get off this board
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin I had 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You,' 'Your Time Is Gonna Come,' and 'Black Mountain Side.' II had 'Thank You,' and 'Ramble On.'<br />It's all there. Right from the start. Led Zeppelin never claimed to be this heavy metal icon that the press made them out to be. Sure, they had some manic tunes that screamed with the best of them. But what put Led Zeppelin above the rest was the fact that they weren't afraid to play whatever type of music they wanted to play, be it country ('Your Time') or an easy listening love song ('Thank You').<br />So why were the critics (and many fans) so shocked when the band  released this album? They could see it coming and yet it seemed to take the whole music world by surprise. This album just expanded on a style the other heavy hitters (such as Black Sabbath) wouldn't dare touch. And that's what put Zeppelin at the top. They refused to be pigeon-holed into one musical catagory. Unfortunately, many bands of the time (and even more today) consider themselves to be a certain type of music instead of expanding their repertoire to be uncatagorizable as Led Zeppelin did.<br />But that's the way all the greatest bands were - just listen to The Beatles for a fine example of that statement.<br />The previous reviewers for this album have done a fine job in the track by track analysis, so there's no need to repeat.<br />If you want what I would consider to be one of the most well rounded classic rock albums of all time by one of the greatest groups of all time, this is the album for you. There really is not a bad cut on the disc.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|For anyone to give a Beatles album one or two stars, no matter what it is, they must have very little sense of what reality is.  I mean. . . IT'S THE BEATLES!!!  If you are  a serious collector, you probably will(and should) buy this.  If you are unsure about buying this new version of an album that is far better than anything that has been released in the last 15 years, then just stay with your original version of this overproduced masterpiece. If you want to hear how Macca originally wanted this album to sound then buy it.   Maybe in the future they will strip down another overproduced masterpiece. . .Sgt. Pepper.
B000002P2W|5.0|Frankly, I am baffled as to the lukewarm reviews this album received.  To me, this album represents the tail end of The Who's creative peak, which occured with the release of Quadrophenia, and it is the album's appropriate lack of ambition is all that prevents it from overtaking it's predecessor as The Who's best work.  Each member of the band contributes their best performances ever, Townshend's songwriting is at it's peak, and each song represents another facet of his amazing talent.  Daltrey sings with more fire than ever in the past, particulary on songs like &quot;Dreaming From The Waist&quot;, and &quot;How Many Friends&quot;.   <br />I am unable to go through the higlights of the album.  Every song is a unique, powerful triumph all it's own.
1400031362|5.0|I think I've enjoyed this the best of the first three No. 1 LDA books. It's the continuing developments of the characters from the earlier books, Precious Ramotswe, Mr J. L. B. Maketoni and the secretary Mma Makutsi. In this book we hear rather less from J. L. B. and so does everyone as he comes down with severe depression and suddenly needs a great deal more looking after than Precious can easily deliver. But while he recedes somewhat into the background, Mma Makutsi is more prominent. Having already been promoted in \\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" to Assistant Detective she now also becomes Assistant Manager of J. L. B.'s car mechanic's company. And when he is removed from the scene by illness there is really no \\"assistant\\" about it. She is, it turns out, rather good at it, better really than she is at being a detective where her enthusiastic belief in phrenology gives her no advantages. With the only other strong and admirable major character being Mma Potokwani of the orphan farm, this gives the story a somewhat feminist feel, conveying as it does a world of powerful women and rather ineffectual men: the damaged J. L. B. Maketoni, the foolish and arrogant Government Man who brings Precious the case that provides the centre of the story, and J. L. B.'s idle and feckless apprentices who grow somewhat less idle and feckless under the iron rule of Mma Makutsi who they both fear and flirt with. The brilliantly conceived character of Precious continues to be the splendid centrepoint. <br />The central mystery is rather more interesting than in \\"Giraffe\\": a domestic drama that Precious clears up by exerting an uncommon measure of common sense in a way that reminded me a bit of some of the Father Brown stories. A second detective storyline, about the potential beauty queens whose morals Mma Makutsi is invited to look into in Precious' absence, is the main source of the novel's finely judged humour. <br />Morality is the persistent theme of the book and there are passages where it is subtly apparent that it is the work of a medical law professor who has to read a lot of fat moral philosophy books for his day job. Sometimes the effect is a trifle gauche. The short conversation on moral weakness, knowing what is right to do but not doing it, between Precious and Mr Pilai on p. 119, is perhaps a faintly clumsy intrusion from Moral Philosophy 100. But the single paragraph on pp. 76-77 that delivers Precious' simple but devastating critique of existentialism makes the book worth reading by itself: \\"You did not need to go to France to meet existentialists, she reflected; there were many existentialists right here in Botswana... She had been married to an existentialist herself, without even knowing it... It was very existentialist, perhaps, to go out to bars every night while your pregnant wife stayed at home, and even more existentialist to go off with girls - young existentialist girls - you met in bars...\\" Brilliant stuff.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I only just got and listened to the CD, so these are very fresh first impressions:<br />The CD is worth buying for the clarity of the sound quality and for the interesting remixes of &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;.  <br />Unlike the Anthology version of &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;, this one is actually listenable--owing mostly to some studio tricks that fill out the sound of the instruments and Paul's voice (which is a violation of the original intent of the project, isn't it?).  I've never been a big fan of Spector's version, but the bare-bones version on Anthology is just God-awful.  So is the new recording of it that Paul did in the 80's.  I think the producers of Let It Be--Naked have succeeded, for the first time, in creating a good Spector-free version of the song.<br />The reworked version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; is also worth a listen.  It, too, employs some studio tricks to fill out the sound, but it's still a more ascetic version than the Martin or Spector versions.  It will never replace the excellent George Martin version (on Past Masters Volume 2), but it's certainly a refreshing alternative to the overworked and top-heavy Spector version on the original album.<br />A few words in Spector's defense (as a producer, at any rate): When he was handed the tapes for &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, he was given some very weak recordings, almost throwaway material.  By the time he was done with them, they were both powerful songs that one would regret not having in the Beatles' canon.  The de-Spectorized versions on the new album only reveal how little Spector had to work with, and highlight his accomplishment.  <br />Lastly: If (as the premise of Let It Be--Naked seems to suggest) Spector is such a misguided producer, why did the producers of Let It Be--Naked mimic his cuts of &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; (trimming it down) and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; (lengthening it)?  Seems he must've done something right after all.
0385504209|5.0|This novel totally captivated me. From the moment I unwrapped it after ordering it from Amazon.com, I was sucked into the story. It is a relentlessly well-told story. I read the first 25 pages standing up in the kitchen, before moving to the living room where I was held hostage by this gripping tale. I was just in the mood for a good, plot-driven book. And this novel delivers. Certainly do yourself a favor and buy this book! Also highly recommended: East Of Eden by Steinbeck, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B000001DYA|5.0|Remember this band (back in my acid days) as the loudest, longest hair, ultimate heavy Marshall Amp cranking dudes I ever heard. The sound and the look evolved into heavy metal, but it pisses me off that all the rock history books give credit to Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin instead of these guys.  I'm telling you, these guys started it.  I don't follow the metal scene today (thrash metal/death metal/black metal) because I'm too old and I find Slipknot and Cannibal Corpse to be just a joke.  How this loud distorted white noise of &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; and &quot;Babylon&quot; (unfortunately not included on this disc) evolved 30+ years later to Slipknot, Pig Destroyer and Cannibal Corpse is beyond me, but I guess it's like heroin.  You gotta keep upping the dosage to get the same buzz until it finally kills you.  I'm sure death metal and thrash metal is on its last legs, becoming like the dying vaudeville scene of the late 30s, with only fewer and fewer diehard fans.  But I'll always remember the beginning, and the great sound of this band, Blue Cheer. To  some kid with a nose ring who listens to Slayer, Mudvayne or Tool it's not going to mean much, but to old Sabbath, Judas Priest or Iron Maiden fans they  might get it.  Try it and hear some of the original riffs, man.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|From a technical standpoint, the digitally remastered and reconstructed &#34;Let It Be&#34; sounds great. Nevertheless, there are some missed opportunities. Why didn't  Apple release the unissued, widely bootlegged 1969 &#34;Get Back&#34; album or the complete &#34;rooftop&#34; performance? Instead of presenting The Beatles &#34;as nature intended,&#34; the new &#34;Let It Be&#34; offers revisionist remixes and re-edited alternate takes with little regard for historic integrity. For all the hype regarding the &#34;de-Spectorization&#34; of the 1970 tracks, it seems odd that Phil's extended version of &#34;I Me Mine&#34; has been retained (minus the orchestration), along with his deletion of the opening and closing vocals on &#34;Dig a Pony.&#34; Admittedly, the digital upgrade and track sequencing gives &#34;Let It Be. . . Naked&#34; a much-needed sonic punch — while the inclusion of &#34;Don't Let Me Down&#34; is most welcome. Unfortunately, the throwaways of &#34;Maggie Mae&#34; and &#34;Dig It&#34; have been omitted, along with the studio chatter. The &#34;Fly on the Wall&#34; bonus disc might have alleviated the slight disappointment regarding the 35-minute revision, but it offers mere snippets rather than complete tracks. What a letdown! Apple should have delivered value for money by providing the unpolished &#34;Get Back&#34; album as a second disc.
B00005JM0B|4.0|A big summer movie that delivers: high-dollar mayhem with a sense of humor.<br />I've heard people complain about the ending but I liked it.  Not what I thought was going to happen (it also breaks a Hollywood screenwriting rule by taking the fate of the story away from the protagonist/hero--but, hey, we didn't come to see John Connor, did we?  So who is the real hero here?).<br />It also fun to see winks at the earlier films.  Arnold's Terminator showing up at a Chippendale's show, the traumatized psychologist from T2 getting traumatized again, etc.<br />The Terminatrix is coldly beautiful and I hope they actually make a robot like her someday (just don't give her a gigantic Death Star-sized laser cannon for a right arm and we'll get along fine).<br />Why wasn't Edward Furlough on board for this?  He probably STILL looks like a kid.<br />The DVD is worth seeing for a scene that should've been in the movie: the hilarious &quot;Sgt. Candy Scene.&quot;  Why was this cut?  It would've provided one of the biggest laughs in the movie, as well as explained a few details for the first two movies.  Thank God for DVDs.<br />For everyone quibbling that this isn't up to the first two movies: &quot;Talk to the hand.&quot;
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have been a DT fan for a long time and i have to say each album they keep getting better and better. I am very impressed with the musicianship they put out on this new album. i cannot wait to see some of these songs played live. Each guitar solo is PERFECT and i feel that John Petrucci is kind of making a statement to all these lame ass players you hear on the radio with no guitar solos. this album gives me hope that we will hopefully see the guitar solo back in mainstream rock again. Mike Portnoy's drumming like always, is incredible. James Labrie does an awesome job singing. John Myung's bass playing is very powerful. Jordan Rudess is awesome on the keyboards especially in &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; and on &quot;Vacant.&quot; i give you no choice but to go buy this album NOW.
078322947X|5.0|I bought this wonderful movie and when i put it in, you get a message saying the movie is in a PAN &amp; SCAN format. It is not shown in its orginal aspect ration which 1:66 (You can look that up on IMDB) So all in all, Universal needs to re-release this wonderful movie on dvd with some bells and wistles but then again this is just one guy's opinion. Thank You for reading.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|I purchased Scarface and it was great.It's a movie about excess and what excess is and what excess can do an individual who had nothing.It's a movie about luck and how unlucky the character was in death.It's about self-esteem because he had none.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|but this time i took time to listen to that album in the record shop and must admit that it sounds... GREAT ! forget madonna (gosh ! she's getting soooo old !) and the single me against the music, it's not the best of the album. it sounds pretty much like kylie minogue for many songs, there are rap songs, ballads with piano (sorry not my kind) but the most interesting are the songs by cathy dennis, excellent former dance singer. she also made kylie's can't get you out of my head ! so if u doubt u'll like that album, listen to showdown and toxic, both songs are absolutely great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <BR>and forget madonna, london, bad promotion, kabbala and all that stuff..... madonna influenced badly britney. <BR>AND GET THIS ALBUM NOW ! IT S EXCELLENT !!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i think britney has done a good job on this cd. i love her new stuff, i was getting sick of that &quot;pop&quot; songs im glad she grew up and got a little personal on this cd. its great i love it. and her song &quot;everytime&quot; is beautiful and really shows off her voice also that fact that its so personal from her past experience with justin, makes the song more beautiful. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is was obviously a labor of love by Eric Clapton for his dear friend, George.  <BR>Excellent sound- and simply done, with clean, simple camerawork that never distracts from the content.  By the way, a previous reviewer said that &quot;Honey Don't&quot; was out of place.  Not so- It's a Carl Perkins tune, and hero of George's and very appropriate as a reflection of his musical influences, since Carl couldn't be there, for obvious reasons...
076790592X|5.0|It is such a great book, anyone who call himself a human being should definitely read it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|What is the task at hand?  I've already expounded upon this recently in referring to The Two Towers.  I will attempt it one more time with some help from the &quot;Nay-sayers&quot; and my own observations.<br />The task at hand is reviewing a DVD containing a story as told in visual media.  Does the story hold up? Does the vision of the Director make the story accessible to the viewer and create tension, provoke reaction, and lead the viewer to a satisfactory conclusion? Has the story successfully conveyed some message?  This is a very subjective question depending upon individual interpretation of what was seen and experienced.<br />None of the above questions or observations that can be made in answer to them HAVE A DAMNED THING TO DO WITH SOME BOOK WRITTEN BEFORE IT!!!!  So there!  I am a huge Tolkein fan, read them all in the late sixties and again in the 70's and 90's (twice) and what Peter Jackson has accomplished here is to very successfully wring pathos, excitement, mystery, fear, despair, HOPE, need, desire, faith, and so much more from the story.  So an unqualified yes to the above questions may be inserted here:<br />We must always remember: One has on an average 20-50 hours of concentrated reading to enjoy Tolkein's story, and a difficult story at that.  On film it is just not possible to rely upon purely literary modes of exposition and plot development to move the characters and move the viewer.  1) It would take decades to make. 2) It would cost BILLIONS to make.  3) It would cost time and money the viewer can ill afford to see it.  4) It would FAIL miserably as a story by being overburdned with too much for the viewer to have to remember in so short a time.<br />I can go on and on but will refrain from burdening my possible readers.  Some salient points however can be construed.  My favorite damnation of the film is when I hear YOU sickeningly zealous Tolkein psychophants rant on about Faramir.  Whiningly lamenting his altered character.  This is theonly topic I'll broach here.<br />Faramir was perhaps an ancilliary character Tolkein put in to expand upon his views of virtue and nobility of spirit.  He was a devout Catholic much troubled by his experiences in the first World War and his writing was as much an exorcism of demons as it was a celebration of what he believed good in the world.  Faramir as a character works in the book as an expository character for virtue and nobility of spirit however, in the film that same characterization would make him pointless.  The story of Faramir as told in the film makes a good tension builder and obstacle to the quest.  Without this we loose Faramir altogether so, YOU ridiculously pompous and self adulatory purist snobs SHUT UP and be thankful he's there at all.  He really isn't necessary to the actual story either written or filmed.<br />In closing I must invite a fellow reviewer to be taken to hand for his own comments.  However passionate, and that is a virtue, and however critical in a negative or positive way we are as critics/reviewers, there is ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE for foul or purely derrogatory language directed at the artist!  Seriously Mr. &quot;Garythemessage&quot; (notice I capitalized your nickname) you should be flayed alive and hung for the buzzards.  Do you honestly think you're some kind of avenging angel from heaven, some Jeanne d'Arc of Tolkein purists?  Perhaps with a nickname like &quot;messengersomesuchtripe&quot; that is truly what you believe and I for one will stand by your side and defend you from attack for voicing your opinions, however I do not hold with your filthy bastardization of Mr. Peter Jackson's name.  And, in sooth I will politely disagree with your studied and somewhat banal criticism as I feel you don't really understand the depths of which you write.  I invite you to write me.<br />I RECCOMMEND THIS FILM IN ALL IT's PERMUTATIONS!  SEE IT, RENT IT, BUY IT.
B00008LDPU|3.0|My view of animation collection video's is that they rarely live up to the expectation.  This video was definately not as good as I expected, while the animation itself delivered, the story lines were lacking and the dialog's were empty.  <br />For those that are a fan of the Matrix world, this is a must have and will be viewed many times.  Otherwise, rent it and watch it once.
0061015725|3.0|Crichton's `Prey' preys on our fears of crossing nano-technology, genetic engineering, bacteria and swarm-like predatory instinct to create a tautly focused techno thriller in the Nevada desert.<BR>The story concerns Jack Forman, an out of work but brilliant AI developer who is undergoing somewhat of a transitory period in his life as he adjusts to being a house husband whilst his wife, Julia, who works for Xymos Technology, is growing increasingly estranged from him. As he struggles to maintain a normal family lifestyle whilst trying to see if her behavioural patterns fit those of a drug-induced problem or if she is having an affair (or both), he finds that the highly secretive work she is carrying out begins to intrude on their lives as their baby, Amanda is taken ill with an undiagnosable condition, but then recovers immediately.<BR>After Julia has a car crash, Jack finds himself being rehired by the company that previously sacked him and he flies out as a consultant to the Xymos facility where he finds the nano-engineering has escaped into the desert and is beginning to exhibit an alarming rate of evolution and developing distinctive predatory swarm-like tendencies. All bit like a twenty-first century artificial version of the classic `Swarm' scenarios.<BR>Throughout there is the reluctant corporate secrets and refusal to accept accountability, portrayed by the charming Ricky, and a small team of brilliant technologists who inevitably start dying one by one from anaphylactic shock.<BR>Tie this in with a highly evolved techno-species that is both parasitic and symbiotic and you get a bigger mystery facing Jack Forman. By the end, Jack has saved the unknowing world, but a great personal cost and Crichton leave us with a chilling message in not thinking through the consequences of our technological advances.<BR>The composition of this techno-thriller is not overly original, the small team, the isolated circumstances they cannot escape, an evolving predator, characters who are representative of bigger motives - all intended to create a claustrophobic effect. Unfortunately, it does make it a little predictable so by the time the real reasons behind the mysteries are given, you've already figured it out. Nonetheless, it does it in a way that is unputdownable. As with all Crichton novels this could easily be converted to the small screen and whilst it is no Jurassic Park, would prove sufficiently entertaining.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This movie definately wasn't a remake of the first Matrix, and definately sets the stage for a wonderful final episode.  The sense of hopelessness and darkness is well maintained and developed over the length of the movie, with the only hope coming at the very end.  This is a movie I will watch many times, so owning the DVD was well worth the cash.

B00005LMBK|5.0|One warning, its not for everyone.  All the 1 star reviews saying how all the songs suck are the kind of people who bought the CD expecting a bunch of songs like &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;.  The collection of tracks on the album are not very radio friendly, and all have their own style.  Its a very disjointed, experimental album, but if your eclectic music tastes include Damon Albarn (Blur), Del! the Funky Homosapien (Heiroglyphics), Kid Koala, Dan the Automator, Cibo Matto, or even Ibrahim Ferrer (Buena Vista Social Club), this album could offer a lot of new sounds for you.
B00007ELEL|5.0|&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a hilarious comedy that disguises itself as something so simplistic, but ends up being nothing of the sort.  If you're looking for a movie with a meaning or a solid and concrete plot, this may be something to skip.  If you're looking for an out-of-control and outrageous comedy with memorable characters and some of the funniest lines ever to be spoken in film, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is something that is definitely worth checking out.<br />The story revolves around a man by the name of Lebowski; actually, he prefers to be called &quot;The Dude.&quot;  A couple of thugs mistake him for a different Lebowski and ruin his most prized rug that really tied the room together.  Well, The Dude isn't going to stand for that kind of &quot;unchecked aggression&quot; (even if he is one of the laziest human beings on the planet).  When he tries to get the other Lebowski to compensate him for his ruined rug, well... let's just say things get very complicated.  And his psychopathic bowling buddy, Walter (who is also a Viet Nam Veteran), doesn't make things any better when he tries to help The Dude with his problems.  But hey, everything's gotta work out in the end, right?  He's The Dude!  He is the man... or at least he better hope so, for his sake.<br />This is one of my favorite comedies.  Although it is almost impossible for me to do the film justice by reviewing it, I have to because it is a movie that I love and watch on a daily basis.  The dialogue and characters are so entertaining and fun to watch that it is almost impossible not to become captivated by the film.  Jeff Bridges is amazing as The Dude and takes his role to the limit.  John Goodman gives his best performance ever and really steals the show for the majority of the film.  Even though he's only in the movie for a short amount of time, John Turturro is HILARIOUS in his two scenes.  The movie is brilliantly written and directed.  The Coen Brothers have made another gem; that much is for sure.<br />Be warned, this is no kiddy movie.  If you get easily offended by movies with foul language, STAY CLEAR FROM THIS MOVIE!!  Every other word in the movie is the f-word, and in fact, according to the IMDb, the f-word appears in the movie 267 times.  So please, take that under consideration.  As foul as this movie is, I think it's necessary and works perfectly for the movie.  It makes the characters what they are.  If you've ever seen the watered-down &quot;TV version&quot; of the movie, you'll know that it quickly loses its spark and appeal that was so well-established in the regular version.  The language is a necessity in this kind of environment, so it's better to avoid the movie if that's going to upset or offend you.<br />The DVD doesn't have a lot to offer, so I'm hoping that one of these days a fully-loaded special edition will come out.  Until then, this is what we're stuck with.  The picture and sound quality really shines in this movie.  You can watch the movie in widescreen or standard format.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|I'm not really a fan of pop music, rather R&amp;B and Hip Hop but Michael Jackson is the one single artist who has changed popular music (every genre)for ever. Think about it - if it wasn't for MJ, most of the successful artists of today, your Justin Timberlake's, Britney Spears and basically every other pop star, as well as most black artists whom Michael paved the way for, for exposure in the mainstream and on MTV owes their career to the groundbreaking nature of everything this man did in the 1980s and early 1990s. This collection despite not really being a definitive collection of his best hits is nevertheless a collection of songs that would make almost any other artist on the planet mouth water and be envious of such a brilliant body of work. The DVD with all the performance in the videos really shows off why Michael Jackson was, is and will forever be the one and only true King of Pop....
B0000035E7|5.0|This is pre-stardom Nirvana, when they were rockin out along side such Seattle greats like Mudhoney and Soundgarden. This is a great record, the production sounds like Steve Albini was on board and its got that great raw, dirty, grunge sound that the pop executives sterilized in Nevermind. Mr.Cobain is in excellent form belting out such classics as &quot;About a Girl&quot; and &quot;Negative Creep&quot;(one of my favs) and there is also time for little goofy songs such as &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot;(funny but also very sick, read the lyrics)and &quot;Big Cheese&quot;. This and In Utero are the most primal and raw of the Nirvana releases and I personally dont blame Cobain for wanting to get back to the dirty grunge that they took out of Nevermind, becase it just isnt fun unless its loud and distorted!

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney sucks.  That's just all there is to it.  She is trying to sing these 'I'm mature' songs with her nasty nasal underdeveloped voice (a bunch of whining and moaning) and relies on shock value to seduce record sales.  Oh, and by the way,  don't see her as a role model, please.  She doesn't want to take any responsibility for her actions.  This album, with an apology to Justin, a song about 'self satisfaction' and one about &quot;I'm all that&quot; boom boom states EXACTLY what Britney is all about:  shallow.
0380789035|4.0|American Gods is modern fantasy centered around many of the Old gods from various cultures and is an interresting story of what could happen in the New World when they are brought to America by followers in the pioneer days and then forgotten.  It's a tale of beings trying to survive, and desperate for the worship which once made them strong, and how a human may be caught up in thier struggle.<br />Shadow, the protoganist, finds himself caught up in a plot by Odin to bring on a war against the new gods of Telivision, Computers and thier minions.  Events culminate into a battle.<br />It did make me think about how important it is to honor the old gods today, something of a \\"what if we never gave them offerings?\\" what would happen to them?  How would they cope?  Fourtunatly, the old gods today are remembered, and given thier offerings by people who still follow the old ways today in the new world.  I found the concept of the new gods of the information age to be interresting, however, I think this is another reminder to live deliberately, and to know how to use a technology properly.  Computers have done more to help spread and gather those who follow the old ways than could have been done without them, so I personally would see computers not as a competing force, but as a tool which has been, and can be used to further the purposes of the Gods and Goddesses.
0553212478|1.0|I have read numerous reviews of this book, and all of them emphasized two extreme: The book is a masterpiece of horror and examination of human nature, or the book is an utter abomination that does not live up to expectations.  Upon reading the book, I failed to see how it has stood the test of time so well, with so many people proclaiming it a masterpiece.  On the other hand, it saddens me to see that some people are so narrow minded as to decry the book merely because it does not live up to its reputation as horror novel.<br />However, in the end one must observe Frankenstein as a literary work in general and not a horror novel whose plot and story have been so twisted and mutilated since its publication with countless inaccurate films and a lack of people who have actually read the book.  When I look at it in this sense, I'm afraid I must still look upon this work with poor esteem.  I stumbled upon a review crying out for people to recognize the depth of this book and not write it off as a horror novel, and I agree with that reviewer; the book does have depth, exploring the human condition in a truely unique way.  However, there is no point in praising a literary work based simply upon the depth of the themes.  No matter how deep a novel it, in the end you still have to read it, and that is the trouble with Frankenstein.  The themes presented in the book can not be assertained because the execution of it is horrendous.  Whether you want to view it as a book of horror or not, one can't help but notice how incredibly bland and drawn out this book is.  It is difficult to stay awake, let alone be captivated, by a book that is so saturated with hyperbole and displaced emotion.  Perhaps if Shelley spent more time developing her characters rather than simply focusing on the exaggerated emotional states of Victor and the Creature, story might actually seem plausible; instead, the character are uniformly formily immaculate and possess the same emotional expressions as Victor.  The only two character that show any distinction are Victor and his father.<br />Also, the plot itself is detestably unrealitistic.  Of course a common complaint is that the creation of the monster is not described at all in detail, and, although the actual process of creation is not important for the developement of the themes of the book, I would have to agree that it wouldn't hurt the show the reader some plausibilty.  Also, it is difficult to grasp the concept that as a human being it takes the average person about a year to learn how to read on a seccond grade level, yet the monster is able to teach himself how to read without the aid of a teacher possessing the knowledge of the fundamental concepts of written language and comprehend works by Ovid and Aristotle in a matter of months, not to mention speak more articulately than I can.<br />In essence, Frankenstein is certainly credible for its depth, but anyone can be a philosopher.  Unfortuantely, literature is an art, and, therefore it takes a talented author to create a reabable and enjoyable vehicle for such insight.  If you can't read a book, it's not good.tor.

0061002860|5.0|This book is considered by many people to be one of the best mysteries ever published.  In my opinion it ranks right up there with Conan-Doyle's Hound of the Baskervilles, as a mystery.  Agatha Christie relied on the convolutions of unraveling a mystery to motivate and pull a plot, along with a great many red-herrings.<br />In this Mystery she employes one of the cleverest and rather subtle red-herring ever in a mystery.<br />I warmly recomend this mystery.  Its well written, well paced and exceptionally clever.<br />The ending will shock you.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have to admit, I was a little leary about buying the CD after hearing 'Me Against The Music' on the NFL Halftime Show, but the song grew on me and it probably has one of the best dance beats on the album (...and there's a lot). After I heard her sing 'Everytime' on SNL I knew I had to buy (...okay, I downloaded it. THEN I bought it.) the album (which I have to rag a little bit about that song: the track on the album is nowhere near as good as it was live on SNL) and, to my surprise, 'Shadow', my new favorite song, is pretty similar to 'Everytime'... <br />The rest of the songs totally grew on me. (As does Britney everytime she releases a new album. She and her music evolves as much as her idol Madonna...) I'd have to say the funnest songs are 'Toxic' and 'Brave New Girl'. The rest of the album pretty much meshes together - the style is all the same past the previously mentioned (excluding 'The Hook Up' and 'Outrageous'... I still haven't made myself listen to the whole songs.)<br />In conclusion, the album is so not Britney. But Britney fans will still love the catchy hooks and danceable tunes and anti-Britney fans will listen to it (without telling anybody, but, trust me, they will.) She did what she set out to do: re-invent herself. Plus it's got lots of base. Which is what my car needs. :)
B00005JLSE|2.0|The characters in this movie never came alive for me. The dancing and singing was well done, but the actors weren't able to make the jump between &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;fantasy&quot; convincing. Only one minor scene, by a minor charactor portrayed any depth of emotion (Mr. Cellophane).
1573229725|5.0|I have recommended this book to many people, explaining that it is simply one of the best books I have ever read. When they ask what it is about, I say &quot;it is set in late 19th century England and is about two rogues (a young woman and a youngish man) who try and steal a rich young woman's fortune by declaring her mad and having her locked up.&quot; To tell more is to give away the delicious plot twists of this absorbing novel. An engaging love story between the two female characters runs throughout, adding an element of humanity and tenderness to the story. Some of the writing is rather dense, and it will not appeal to all readers, but if you love suspense, romance, and jaw dropping plot twists, you will not be disappointed with this one!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Venturing in a  new direction Britney has shed the cookie cutter pop monotony for a more diverse sound.  Granted her vocals are enhanced and half of her tracks feature artist supplementation, she actually pulls off this CD well.  I've been a fan of Britney as a &quot;performer&quot; and would be curious as to how she'd perform these tracks live.  Don't get me wrong - she makes each song her own.  It's the most creative album from her yet...I loved the slower song &quot;Shadow&quot;, the danceable &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, and the remix of &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;. I think it's worth a listen - even if the lyrics seem &quot;corny&quot; they're catchy.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Don't even try to compare to Matrix as my stupid Video Store guy tried to do. This is probably the most underpromoted movie of all times. You can compare it to George Orwell's 1984 but not Matrix, Matrix what? I just loved the fight scenes, the storyline, the plot, and everything else. Just don't miss it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I can't believe people don't like this-If you are not a fan of hers, or even like pop music than just don't buy the CD! She has a soulful sound on this CD, sounds great to me!<br />I think the songs are great-All have a beat, and her songs sound differant- I really enjoy her slow song, #12- Very sad song- I am glad I got this CD-
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm tired of all these so called 'music experts' who are so far above listening to Britney that they come on Amazon.com just to complain about her...don't make much sense to me. <br />I'm also tired of people saying that Britney lacks depth and diversity...who cares, did she ever once say that this album was on the same level as Bob Dylan or something? No, she said that this was a dance album, pure and simple. And that's what it is, and it's a great one at that. Yeesh, she's like 21, not 60. Even if she was singing about life, nature, politics, would u take her advice since your so against her anyway? Didn't think so.<br />Stand outs are, Toxic, Breathe On Me, Early Mornin' and the remix of 'Me Against The Music'.<br />The albums got great beats, great hooks, great songs, and the liner pictures are nice...;)<br />I say good for you Britney, give all those 'I'm above listening to Britney' people (who listen to The Clash and The Strokes because they think they have to) more to cry about.<br />Five out of Five
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Well, for one thing, she is good at blending music genres. But, my personal opinion is a computer is singing her music cause it doesn't sound anything like her. She has 4-5 star songs (Me Against The Music, Touch of my Hand, Everytime), but she has some -5 star songs too (Brave New Girl). <br />This probablly by far is her best album and argueably her best songs, but remember, its Britney. Even if her album goes multi platinum, it shows how many tweens she is drawing in despise parents. <br />She is better in my opinion than Christina and maybe even Madonna, but both have stronger points than she does. Christina certainly has a better voice but not enough good songs on one album and Madonna is a good advertiser and reinventer, but she does it too much.<br />But back to the point. Her album may be more, may be less, but she defitnely deserves this to be her best work.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The theatrical version of the Two Towers was awesome. The drama, the locations, the battles, the performances of the actors, everything. Well, just as was done with the Fellowship of the Ring extended cut, the whole movie gets a huge upgrade from its' already excellent status in this 4 DVD set. There is 45 minutes worth of scenes that were not in the theatrical cut. And they all seem to do one of 4 purposes. 1: Give us more scenes and/or more lines from the book, including an homage to Tom Bombadil by Treebeard. 2: Explain and expand the plot and the characters of the Two Towers to a greater extent. 3: help set up events in the Return of the King much better. 4: add more witty and humurous moments. A perfect example of No. 2 is Faramir. He has some additional scenes towards the start of the second disc that, without giving it away, GREATLY help his character and his characters motivations. I know this was one of the critisisms of the theatrical version, that Faramir was a weak and weightless character. Those who have critized Pete Jackson and Co. for this should really watch this extended cut. <br />As with the first movie extended cut, the 4 movie commentaries are all fascinating(if VERY time consuming!). The whole set is just awesome. I could ramble on all day about this. Just get it and experience it for yourself!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I recommend this DVD for everyone, especially Shania fans.  There's a reason she won the Entertainer of the Year award at the Country Music Association Awards in 1999.  While I love her music, after you see the DVD you will realize she was born to be on stage.  This concert includes hits from most of her CDs, and you'll realize just how many great songs she has.
6305842442|4.0|I know most of the published reviews said the directors cut was better than the original, but I beg to differ.  If I hadn't seen the original, I would have been much more lost about what was going on in the diretors cut.  I liked the &quot;corny&quot; voice overs that other reviewers complained about, which DID help you understand what was going on better.  I also liked the &quot;happy ending&quot; from the original.  It was such a dark movie otherwise, I thought the happy ending gave hope about the future instead of the more pessemistic view of the directors cut version.  I thought the unicorn scene from the directors cut added absolutely nothing to the original story, I didn't see the point of putting it in there.  If something isn't broken, don't fix it. <br />                 John,<br />                 Goleta, ca
0671027387|5.0|Deception Point, Dan Brown's 2nd novel and the last before the Robert Langdon series of books (Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code) begins, deals with the ins out outs of politics in Washington, government conspiracies, and just how far a group might be willing to go to win a Presidential election. It is a really fun read that goes at a pace that will leave your heart racing.<br />When Rachel Sexton, the central character and an information officer for the government's National Reconnaissance Office is summoned by none other than the President himself, she knows something big is going down. Especially since her father is the President's opponent in the upcoming election. One of the biggest discoveries in the history of man has been made (or has it?) - something so big it overshadows the election itself.<br />Rachel must battle to find the truth in spite of being hunted by an unknown team of assassins who are controlled by a shadowy figure in Washington. A figure who will do anything to keep the truth from coming out. She must also battle her own internal demons in a tug of war between loyalty to her manipulative father and the person she believes should win the Presidency.<br />If you are a fan of action-packed conspiracy thrillers, this is the book for you. It's an all-around fun read and a great part of author Dan Brown's work. Pick up a copy and I don't think you will be disappointed.
B0000029DD|5.0|It breaks my heart to listen to Jeff Buckley, knowing that such an incredible talent died so young.  To think what could have followed this outstanding album is just painful.  But if there's a positive here, at least we were left with &quot;Grace&quot;, one of the most flawless, poignant and introspective albums of the 90s.<br />To listen to Buckley sing is equivalent to having every one of your senses awakened at the exact same time.  Not since Van Morrison have I heard a male rock voice that's so completely pure and full of emotion.  Don't believe me?  Put on &quot;Lover You Should Have Come Over.&quot;  Or listen to his immaculately beautiful cover of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah.&quot;  The agony in Buckley's voice on songs like &quot;Mojo Pin&quot; sends shivers down your spine.  And even the more &quot;commercial&quot; songs like &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; are meticulously performed.  Other favorites include Buckley's rich cover of &quot;Lilac Wine&quot; and the dreamlike title track, &quot;Grace,&quot; but as a whole, the entire album is brilliant. <br />The music world lost an incredibly gifted performer the day that Jeff Buckley died.  He was quite possibly the voice of our generation.  Thank God we still have a reminder of his talent in &quot;Grace&quot;.
1572814136|5.0|I have always loved the Rider Waite Tarot; it was my first tarot deck that I have ever owned.  But the colors of the original where always so boring.  Then Came the Universal Waite that had nice colors, but they just seemed so soft to me.  Then finally the Radiant Rider Waite comes along, with the classic images that we all know and love, and finally you see things in a whole new way.  Much Brighter, and yes you can say a little more Radiant.  This deck will be around for a long time.  <br />I love it and use it frequently.  The deck is standard Tarot size, same size as the Universal and regular Rider Waite.  The Back of the cards is a very nice Night Sky Blue filled with yellow stars.  The colors of the images are not really radiant, in the harsh sense of the word, but more vibrant.  If you look close, you can tell that the original images have been retouched, as many facial features have a slight difference.   The deck shuffles well, a little slippery, and the corners are smooth.  The card stock is flexible, but made to last; this deck will last many usages.  <br />There is one minor setback.  The smell of the cards, at times is to over whelming.  I have tried everything to get that factory smell out of them.  I have spoken to a few others who own the deck and they have the same problem.   Hopefully after many usages this weird aroma will leave.  <br />But beside that the deck is really good, it is defiantly my favorite of all the Rider Waite Clones.  I recommend it to all beginners and advanced tarot readers or collectors.  Nice deck for those who are just starting out.  The images on this deck are familiar and comforting.  Plus almost all books dealing with learning Tarot use Pamela Smith's images.  So this deck would make a great gift for yourself or for your loved ones.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This concert begins just before twilight, the sun setting over the river Boyne, the crowd singing the first few lines of By the Way 'Standing in line to see the show tonight, and there's a light on ......'. Flea, John and Chad arrived on stage, then to be joined by Anthony to start the song the crowd had pre-empted. The selection of songs and their musicianship are perfection, their sartorial sense perhaps less so. The DVD shows Flea wearing a full skeleton outfit, Chad a boiler suit, John in rodeo wear and Anthony giving a more toned down than usual but still present nod to Angus Young in cut-off trousers and two-tone top with the essential wrestling gloves. Extraordinary. <br />Flea's musical flair and personality are showcased here to great effect with his skillful playing and friendly manner. Standout tracks for him were 'Throw Away Your Television' and 'Give it Away', and to top it all he gives a flourish of trumpet playing during the encore which merely confirms his amazing talent and love of this art form. He made the most asides to the crowd with mention of the local geography and some distant Irish relatives which gave their performance wit and made it more personal. In a fleamail (on the official website) written the previous night, the gig is mentioned and seemed truly excited. <br />John was also inspiring blending a mesmerising range of textures and styles into his guitar playing and providing sweet harmonies. He does a brief solo do-wop song on chapter 2 of the DVD which is beautiful. Other striking harmonies are on Universally Speaking, Havana Affair (by the Ramones) and Purple Stain. Chad's drumming was awesome and focused and the distinctive tones of Anthony's vocals were in equal parts honeyed and adrenalized. <br />This concert was staged on the 23rd August, the birthday of Keith Moon and River Phoenix, and this performance, by one most the artistic and talented bands out there, is a perfect tribute. Get yourself a treat for the weekend.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I am having a difficult time suppressing my anger for the retarded negative reviews of this CD. This CD is what a progressive metal CD should be. It is heavy, melodic, and pure energy. I can't stop listening to it! Each one of the band members have a pronounced role within each piece - if you understand progressive music well enough, you can hear it clearly. It does sound a bit like old Metallica (.....And Justice For All) and Tool. This is not a CD where you skip tracks because they are not good. Each track is awesome. The short slow piece is the only non-progressive track, and that only gives the CD a break from the onslaught of heavy guitar riffs Petrucci provides. The progressive segments in each piece seem a little unorganized at first. However, after a few listens, it becomes very organizd and somewhat linear. <BR>My favorite song is song #4 - Honor Thy Father. A wonderfully written piece of how the dogma of a father-son relationship transpires into resentment and anger when the father takes advantage of that expected respect. Yes there is a little anger on this CD, but it is well placed anger. I would call it more frustration and disbelief regarding our cultural and social enclaves. <BR>Pourtnoy and Petrucci are outstanding on this CD. We finally see Pourtnoy play straight times for more than a half of verse!!! Don't get me wrong, that progressive element strongly resides. However, it is heavy, fast, and powerful. The double bass work is a pleasure to listen to, and his incorporation of quick paradiddles and rolls is inhuman. <br />If you are looking for Scenes of a Memory or 6 Degrees, than I suggest you go back and listen to those and remain musically stagnant. If you are looking to hear a new heavier sound of Dream Theater, then this is the CD you want. This CD has raw energy that drains you. I am spent after listening to this one!! <BR>Keep it up Dream Theater!!! Do not change a thing!!!
0385504209|5.0|From the beginning to the end, THE DA VINCI CODE grabs your attention and never lets go.  It is a gripping tale of a man and a women who have never met before but are brought together by the mysterious death of a very important man.  The two are takin on a ride of their lives as they try to solve mysteries throughout the whole book.  The ending of this book was outstanding with an amazing twist that I would have never guessed would happen.  THE DA VINCI CODE was so good that it took me only two days to read all 454 pages of it.
B000089RVR|5.0|I first heard about the CD while watching The Sharon Osbourne Show.I had never heard of Dido.She sand a few cuts and I was hooked.This is a great CD.I understand that this is the number one CD in Europe and the top ten in The US. I look foward to more of her music.
0385504209|1.0|This book is to Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; as a microwaved corn dog is to a five course meal with matched wines.<br />The corn dog's quicker, but you'll enjoy the meal more.<br />Hack-iest writing device: I counted at least FIVE CHAPTERS that ended with &quot;...and (so-and-so) was so amazed, they couldn't begin to believe what they saw.&quot;
0385504209|3.0|As a Holy Grail adventure, this book is every bit as entertaining as &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,&quot; though maybe not quite as good as &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail.&quot;  As scholarship, though --- weeeeeell, put it this way: Da Vinci is not Leonardo's name.  It's the description of where he came from.  Calling him &quot;Da Vinci&quot; is rather like those scenes in &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure&quot; in which the time-traveling heroes address Billy the Kid as &quot;Mr. The Kid.&quot;<br />Still, if you can accept the existence of an alternative universe in which serious art historians refer to &quot;Da Vinci&quot; and Harvard pays people good money to teach new-age &quot;Symbology&quot; and French scholars leave elaborate paper-chase clues in doggerell English verse, then this is an enjoyable if totally improbable thriller.  (A sedentary, bookish man can go without sleep for 48 hours and still outwit the most sophisticated law-enforcement agencies in Europe?????)  But I do hope that people who read this book won't believe that Mary Magdalene was &quot;the Holy Grail,&quot; generally regarded as a crackpot theory, or that the tomb of Mary Magdalene can be found where the book claims it can, which will be a major headache for the poor custodians who supervise that actual location. I won't give away any more of the plot, except to say that if you know Roger Ebert's &quot;law of character economy&quot; you will be able to figure out who the mysterious master-mind is well before the end.<br />But if you want to read a REALLY scholarly (albeit deadly dull) novel on themes like the Holy Grail, the Goddess, and the Knights Templar, read &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; by Umberto Eco.
B00009TB5G|4.0|The first 2 DVD's seem to work fine in my set top home DVD player (Aiwa) but the 3rd and 4th discs are unplayable and bounce between tracks 1 &amp; 2 continuously (looping)? Have already returned one set but the second set I got seems to have the exact same problem. These supplemental discs do play in my PC's DVD drive. This problem does not occur with any of my other DVD's including the Extended Edition of the Fellowship of the Ring. Are others experiencing this  issue?
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Now I can see why they brought in Phil Spector to re-produce the original album back in the 60s. On \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" especially, the lack of strings in this version makes the song really fall short. \\"I Me Mine\\" is more of a curiousity--not losing too much in the transition to only acoustic, but not gaining much either. \\"Across the Universe\\" holds up better, probably due to the string-like sitar effects in the backround. If you already own the original, don't waste your money.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I am 2 years older than Britney and love her to death!  I am so glad she has evolved into a singer I can listen to without having to feel like I'm listening to Raffi.  I think she's the Madonna of my age group, and that she isn't giving us anything that Madonna didn't give my 32 & 34 year old sisters at my age.  With this album she's proving that she is the diverse, sexy, grown-up she's been accused of being since she was 15.  As far as her not being a role model, so what?!  Just because she's young dosen't mean she has to appeal to little girls.  The problem parents have with her is that she came out and seemed so innocent and then got the chance to be herself, finally.  I love her, and I can't wait to get whatever her next venture may be...
B00009TB5G|5.0|When i first heard about these great works of Tolkien being filmed i was doubtful to say the least. As a long time fan of the Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings trilogy i just didnt think it could be done correctly. I was wrong. This extended version is nothing short of stunning in every aspect. The directors cut is much more cohesive just as the Fellowship uncut version is. If your a fan of Tolkien or not, this is part two of an epic that will set the standard for future epic films. Five stars are not nearly enough.
B000092ZYX|3.0|I love Radiohead, I always have, and I always will.  With that said, Hail To The Thief is probably the worst record they've made, but it's still a good album.  Sure, it's not the creative breakout that The Bends is, it's not the progressive rock odyssey that OK Computer delivered, or even the genre bending work of art that Kid A is, but how can you follow these three and keep raising the standard?  Radiohead has given us a new and different sound for every album, and it looks like there may not be many more things to do, but at least they'll do it well.
0060254920|5.0|Thanks to vibrant illustrations and an intriguing storyline that brings the monsters out from under the bed, this is still the greatest children's book of all time.  Definitely a favorite!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|LOVE THIS CD..GREAT JOB BRITNEY! I'VE BEEN A FAN OF HERS SINCE FROM THE RELEASE OF HER FIRST ALBUM BABY ONE MORE TIME. SHE REALLY CHANGED HER STYLE AND CHANGE IS GOOD..LOVE HER NEW CD! CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER ONE...SO FAR MY FAVOURITE SONGS ARE: I GOT THAT BOOM BOOM, TOXIC, SHADOW, SHOWDOWN..BUT ALL OF THEM ARE GREAT..JUST CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO IT.
B00005JMFO|5.0|The beginning was a little slow but soon it starts to come together.  This was a movie I brought my wife to so she could watch a movie without all the action I usually subject her to.  I ended up loving this movie and would see it again.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears comes back time after time to prove she isn't just a 1, 2, or 3 hit wonder. After many predictions that this album would be her first flop, Britney comes out with amazing beats to prove them wrong. She has officially left her \\"pop\\" image to explore different sounds, producers, and different styles. <br />Is it all a gimic? After listening to this album all the way through, you can feel her presence. You can feel it in her lyrics and you just want to get up and dance with her. Surprisingly, this isn't the typical \\"love and relationships\\" kind of album that we are used to from Britney, Christina, NSYNC and the rest of the former pop crowd. \\"In the Zone,\\" is simply about going out, being free and dancing. Many of the songs are personal and you can feel yourself go on a journey with Britney.<br />In \\"Breathe On Me,\\" we hear a sultry, sexy Britney like we've never heard before. Compared to Kylie Minogue by many, this song has potential to be a huge hit for Britney. \\"The Hook Up,\\" could also easily be a #1 as it has a Sean Paul inspired sound. The only \\"pop\\"-like song \\"Brave New Girl\\" gives the word pop a new meaning with a different edge.<br />Many songs need a second listen to actually like and understand. \\"Showdown,\\" was instantly a favorite of mine along with the R. Kelly penned \\"Outrageous.\\" \\"Toxic\\" is a favorite of most everybody who purchases this album. It is funky, fun, edgy and fresh all at the same time. The lyrics accompanied with the beat cannot be beaten. <br />The title track \\"Me Against the Music\\" featuring Madonna was a wise choice for the first track and comeback single. The remixed version puts a new flare on the track. You can't judge the whole album based on this song as the music from track to track is different in every single way.<br />Unlike many other albums being released, this album is indeed 'in your face' without having to come across dirty or trashy. Britney gets her points across but doesn't have to be labeled a sell-out in the process.<br />Well folks, looks like Britney is hitting the charts at the top yet again, and nobody can stop her now. With hip-hop, clubby beats, a hint of rap, and a dash of pop - Britney has done it again and we can certainly expect a lot more in the future.
6305513406|5.0|Star Trek: The Original Series Volume 1 presents two episodes from 1966:<br />\\"Where No Man Has Gone Before:\\" Although this was the third episode aired, it's actually the pilot that sold the show to NBC. Many things make it obvious that this is the pilot -- e.g. no McCoy or Uhura, drab colorless uniforms, absence of skimpy miniskirts, ray gun rifle, etc. There's nothing childish about this episode. There's no kid or jokster robot as in, say, Lost In Space. Even the music is dramatic and powerful. The chemistry between Kirk & Spock is right there from the opening scene featuring the duo. The subject of \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" is explored as the momentum of interest, mystery and suspense builds culminating in the action-filled climax. A one-of-a-kind debut adequately testifying that Star Trek was a winner right out of the opening gate. GRADE: A+<br />\\"The Corbomite Maneuver:\\" An excellent suspense-building episode with a simple moral: appearances can be deceiving. This segment would've made a great pilot as well with its excellent combination of space exploration, mystery, creepy aliens and characterization. McCoy, Uhura and Yeoman Janice Rand all make their debut here. It's obvious that this is the first episode produced for TV after the NBC executives approved the (second) pilot because most of the characters are still developing. For instance, you'll notice Spock's uncharacteristic shouting and almost-apology to Kirk for having no helpful suggestions, Uhura's one-dimensional dialogue (\\"Hailing frequencies open, sir\\") and Rand, who appears as little more than a Starship maid. Bottom Line: it's slow and ship-confined but somehow strangely fascinating. The baby-like Balok hiding behind a much more menacing facade is a great idea. The occasional visuals of the fearsome alien greatly add to the mounting suspense. The awe and mystery of space exploration is successfully captured. GRADE: A<br />Incidentally, ever wonder who came up with the idea to dress the ladies in those ridiculously short miniskirt \\"uniforms\\"? When Grace Lee Whitney (Janice Rand) was hired on after the acceptance of the pilot they dressed her in the same black stretch pants seen in that episode. Whitney basically said \\"No way,\\" insisting that the girls should look like girls. Her protests led to William Ware Theiss' design of the now infamous hotpants uniform.ladies in those ridiculously short miniskirt \\"uniforms\\"?

B000002KXV|5.0|The Nightfly, Donald Fagen's 1982 masterpiece, is nostalgia for the future at it's best. Wait a minute!! Since \\"nostalgia\\" implies a longing for days gone by (i.e, in the past), how can you have nostalgia for the future? Because the once and future frontman of Steely Dan is nostalgic for a time in the past (the late 1950's; specifically the International Geophysical Year of 1957-1958) that showcased the limitless possibilities of the future. During this year, many futuristic displays were unveiled that depicted a future free of worry and woe, a technological marvel of moving sidewalks, wheels in space, and flying cars, not unlike the one depicted in The Jetsons. Free of partner Walter Becker's cynicism, Fagens writing takes on a warmth that is almost lyrical, and makes such a world very appealing indeed. \\"I.G.Y.\\" is the song that allows this vision to come to its fullest fruition, the keyboards and saxaphones giving the feel of a very late Steely Dan album such as Gaucho. Fagen is no Pavarotti, but his Northeast-born, Miami-drenched voice brings much warmth and stylishness to his cover of Dion's \\"Ruby Baby.\\" \\"New Frontier\\" is 50's jazzman Dave Brubeck's swing in doubletime (asked if he plays jazz or rock, Fagen reportedly answered: \\"Rock, but we swing when we play.\\"), while \\"Walk Between Raindrops\\" is a very appealing love-encounter-in-a-rainstorm number that once again, takes place in the Miami of Fagen's dreams. Perhaps the best number of the set is the title track, as Fagen tells the tale of a third-shift disc jockey, whose show features \\"jazz and conversation\\" and who takes calls from people who \\"think there's a race of men in the trees,\\" while he drinks plenty of java and smokes Chesterfield Kings. Throughout, Fagen's tone is warm and appealing, inviting the listener to forget his cares and join him in a wonderful world that never existed, but like so many fantasy worlds, held literally endless possibilites. So, if your in the mood for pure jazz-rock nostalgiaand a vision of an America without limits, then get The Nightfly today. You may indeed find yourself having nostalgia for the future!!!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This CD is nothing but sleazy TRASH that could be best used as a frisbee. On this disc, Britney is a horrible influence on her many young fans while on her quest for shock value. It seems like there is more moaning than singing on it and sex is of course the main topic of the lyrics. I've bought all her other albums, but wouldn't touch this one w/ a nine foot pole. The woman has gone off the deep end and is out for nothing but attention....there is no artistic integrity to be found on this disc. An absolute waste of the plastic that was used to manufacture it!
B0000TB014|5.0|A good collection of music videos for fans around the world!Thank you,Michael,you're still the King of POP!
B000001FS3|5.0|From &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; to &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot;, U2 take you on a timeless journey through their music which sounds as if it could be recorded yesterday. It's easily one of the best albums of the 80s, was awarded the Grammy for &quot;Album of the year&quot; and as time goes on, has become one of the best albums in music EVER. You have the cinematic &quot;Exit&quot;,  the gospel &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot;, the Zeppelin-ish &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;With Or Without You&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, and the list goes on and on... on its own it will stand the test of time. <br />Even the outtakes and B-sides (some of which have since been released on Best of U2 1980-1990) are classics. Hopefully, Island will put this out as part of their Deluxe series as they have done with Bob Marley's CDs, hopefully in Surround Sound, as it should have been intended to be heard. There's so much going on in the album's undercurrents that it would take it to a new level. <br />There was a LOT of material filmed for the &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; movie from the Joshua Tree tour, which would make for a great CD/DVD box set (including the videos) detailing this album and tour from beginning to end, that hopefully fans will want something a little more complete than the movie was able to provide at the time. The movie is fine, but there was so much left out from the actual shows that would be great to have for a 20th anniversary collection in the not-too-distant future.  I think that now that U2 have proven themselves time and time again, this part in their history is still remembered as being a favorite of many.
B00003CXA4|5.0|Every once in a while this world produces an exceptional human being whose presence makes it a much better place to live in. Such a person was Mahatma Gandhi; the Indian `radical' whose teachings about non-violent resistance lead to the eventual independence of India from British colonial rule. His teachings have inspired other such movements in the world and his life has been looked up to as a standard which others have tried to emulate.<br />Every once in a while those responsible for the academy awards have chosen deserving films. This is one of them. Ben Kingsley gives a grand performance as Gandhi, from his youth to his death. The impersonation is spot on; everything from the accent to the gait is so convincing that one could swear Kingsley was Gandhi. <br />If you are looking for a biography of this man on film, this movie is an excellent source. Condensing Gandhi's life into a few hours is such a great feat, especially when there is so much of this man that could be explored. The movie was filmed in India, with 300,000 extras, so if you like epic films you will definitely enjoy this one. The scenery is authentic and the characters have a reality about them so often lacking in `hollywood' films. No `eye-candy' version of a historical event, this is a real movie about a real person.<br />The DVD extras were ok for a film this old. There is some original newsreel footage which is quite short but still worth watching to see the real Gandhi as he was. Kingsley also gives a talk about how it was being Gandhi, there is also some of the sayings of Gandhi; great candidates for those memorable sayings we all try to memorize to motivate ourselves. All in all a great DVD, the movie is a timeless classic about a great man of the modern world.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is talented people... admit it.  The cd was a pleasant surprise to me.

Christina has the guts to stand up &amp; sing about serious issues like self asteem, getting hurt by your first love, going for your goals, dealing with domestic abuse, &amp; so on.  She sings beautifully on each track &amp; sends out a positive message to girls everywhere. (the only naughty girl songs on this cd are &quot;Dirrty&quot;, &amp; &quot;Get mine, get yours&quot;... everybody needs to learn to look past Christina's scantily clad exterior...listen to her voice &amp; her lyrics...then judge her for her talent, not the outfits she wears.

B00008PW3Q|1.0|I love some of these reviews Ive read. Like the guy saying &quot;OHMYGOD, someone left Stevie for another woman&quot;...where have you been, that was what Rumours was all about, Lindsey the genius left her way back when (she lucked out! as karma would have it, who would turn their nose up at Stevie Nicks loving them? Insane fellow, she didnt need him!). <br />Whats the deal with this poor music? Why are the only good songs on here OLD Stevie demos again, ? The two or 3 'new' ones from Stevie suck, theyre childish, pedestrian to say the LEAST nicely, like music from a ten year old. Whats the word Im looking for....SOUL LESS and guys, 2 notes staccato DONT make a melody. I guess Stevie has reverted to songwriting infancy. <BR>Vengeance, husband stealing in YOU DONT HAVE HIM, I DO HAVE HIM, WHEN HE CAN GET AWAY....tasteless, childish, and downright low moraled. Stevie was always ethereal, HIGH on morals...this is junk, its like purchased material not written by her. Then we have Silver Girl, and old demo with new junk added, ALL ABOUT ME again childish....GO ON SAVE YOURSELF is a true oldie, older than Fleetwood Mac....the only good stuff here is OLD already. I think Stevie's been poisoned by her garden, is right on the money. Bizarre. A lot of &quot;death&quot; and &quot;morbidity&quot; themes on this CD, get it if thats what youre into.<br />I hate to even comment on Lindsay the Insane...but I cant resist doing ONE. &quot;Come&quot; seems to be an inadvertent tribute to revealing the scope of his manhood! Oh my god is right. Lindsay, does that reaction happen alot with lovers? Hmmm..food for thought! As usual, Lindsays contributions are deranged, revengeful, touched and twisted. Its as if Mr. Buckingham has a jealous insanity rage going on after dumping Stevie and her saying &quot;dont come back&quot;. Get over it, you did it! Hes like insanely jealous that she blows him away musically. He cant face it and really, look at the man and what he lyrically writes, hes sosmall and backstabbing....he must have no life or happiness. Only a fool would turn around at a second chance and say &quot;now Im leaving you&quot;, that is SOOOOO Base. Grow up!<br />People, if you dont like a song the first time, TAKE A HINT - even RAP can grow on you, that doesnt mean its GOOD. Did you need to hear DREAMS twice to like it? <br />Enough said. Crap to make a buck. Illume is an oldie too, its pre-911 but nice schtick to make it fly. Seems Stevie has lost her muse and her SOUL, 'oh well' as fleetwood would say. A good album to buy if you want to take a mental trip into the world of Picasso and derangedness with Lindsay, or be stunned at the lack of creativity of the new Ms. Nicks. Only good for its rehashes of old demos from the good old days, recorded better than the bootlegs. Only thing left untouched now, to finagle a new album/profit out of, is Three Birds of Rhiannon. We're all out of ammunition arent we! I predict nothing good to follow musically, as I know all the bootlegs and we're just about done re releasing them now. Sorry Lyndsay, but I picture you as a leech with the warped perception that FM revolves around you, breakup strife of Rumours (??? heh, dont think so) or some other nonsense - grow up and face it, Stevie Nicks was the Muse of the Century, and you were lucky to have her take YOU along for the ride. :) It was the melody and the poetry all along that gathered her following. All good things must come to an end, I guess.
B000093BDX|5.0|I got this CD for only one song...Kokomo. I ended up loving every single song on this CD. I'm 19 and never really knew who the Beach Boys were. But now I listened to the CD over a million times in a very short period of time. They are all so talented and I love the harmony of all four guys. I'm happy I purchased this CD because it was worth every penny I spent! I'm a very satisfied customer! You'll no doubt just love them and learn all the words to all the songs in no time at all...You'll listen to it that much!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|What a waste.  She cannot sing a lick. No substance or range to her thin wispy voice. The songs are not fresh. She needs all the help she can get. Just look at the list of credits. She might make a good aerobics instructor.

For those people who wrote bad about this cd is really on one and needs to get off the crack, cause crack kills it really does. 50 cent is an amazing rapper and Get Rich or Die Tryin is one of the best cd's i have ever went out and got. If you listen to his music his tellin you about his life and thats something real. 50 cent is a very wonderful rapper with  many skills ans many talents and if I had the money I would go to every city and state and buy every cd. This cd is one of a kind, if you dont have it go out and get it. His beats are on point and his lyrics are off the chain. The way he puts things makes you feel like your him. I think 50 and G-Unit is the hottest rappers out right now.  If you want some real rap music, something you know you can really dig go get 50 cents cd and you will see what im talkin about
B0000B3B95|1.0|I can't believe they spent $150 million on this crap.  The plot stinks.  Don't waste your money on this big green turkey.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney's One Wish Album is very different in traditional sounding Christmas music.  It has flavor and a hip tune to make you sing along and enjoy Christmas all year long.  I know I'll listen to this Album on a regular basis including the holidays.  I am so proud of Whitney and solicit everyone to support Whitney and experience her NEW CD, because it's banging.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater proves their diversity yet again.<br />I've been a fan of Dream Theater for over 10 years.  I've waited with excruciating anticipation before each of their releases to hear what they are doing new.  Each time, they did not fail to surprise me.  This time is no exception, although this direction was hoped for.  This album is a very welcomed milestone on their path of musical evolution.  <br />Between the tracks &quot;Fatal Tragedy&quot; and &quot;Home&quot; from &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2&quot; and &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;, &quot;The Great Debate&quot; and &quot;The War Inside My Head - The Test That Stumped Them All&quot; from &quot;Six Degress of Inner Turbulence&quot;, we can see Dream Theater preparing for an album of this type of power.  However, this is far beyond what I could have imagined coming from these guys.  This album is overloaded with energy.  <br />The technical skill of these musicians has to be at their highest so far, to be able to pull this album off (especially if they are planning on playing it live).  James Labrie does not seem to be intimidated to try new techniques with his voice, to push his vocals or to use technology to enhance them.  John Myung really does take center stage on this album.  You can hear how talened this musician really is.  John Petrucci continues to astound with overwhelming ability that is sure to raise the bar for other guitarists.  Jordan Rudess does not take a back seat on this album and supplies the ambience that separates this progressive metal album from just highly technical heavy metal.  Mike Portnoy seems to be right in his element with this album, and continues to demonstrate justification for why he is considered one of the best drummers alive.<br />A portion of the music on this album seems to be inspired somewhat by previous songs.  At least on one occassion you can pinpoint the exact source that the music draws inspiration from.  At other times its a bit more difficult to tell.  The example of obvious inspiration would be a vocal riff from Metallica's &quot;Blackened&quot; in the song &quot;This Dying Soul&quot;.  Other times throughout the album, I was reminded by certain melodies of early Dream Theater (perhaps &quot;Images and Words&quot;, but more likely &quot;Awake&quot;).<br />Regardless of where Dream Theater drew their inspiration, this album is uniquely theirs.  There are still the elements present in the music that would immediately give away the fact that this album can be nothing other than a Dream Theater album.<br />As I said, this is a very welcomed and excellent addition to my Dream Theater library.  Now that they have done an album of this power (which will carry for a very long time), perhaps they might (as they seem to never stay in one place) do another album more inspired by Images and Words (like Metropolis Pt. 2) before they do another album like this one.  Although, I will be waiting in anticipation for them to outdo themselves once again with another heavy ensemble, when they do top this album down the road (the same way I am waiting for them to outdo &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2&quot; with another concept album).<br />My recommendation for any fan of Dream Theater is to buy this album as soon as you possbily can.  You won't regret it.  Just don't expect &quot;Images and Words&quot; here (think more like evolved &quot;Awake&quot;).  For fans of progressive metal in general, you should definately give this album a try.  Fans of heavy metal (and even nu-metal) should not hesitate to buy this album.  <br />The energy present may be more than some might be able to handle.  Be sure to play this one loud.<br />I'd give this album 10 stars if it were available.
B000002LGW|3.0|I know that live albums are usually a waste of time - what's the point in listening to a live CD when you weren't there? If you were not there you missed it and renders this CD pointless. Now I love DM as much as anybody else and I bought this off a friend who found it in his house for 7........to me the whole album fails to translate whatever significance the show had. I know that it was a very emotional night for them but what use is that when you hear identikit tunes just with a crowd singing along. Just seems like another gig to me. I think you'd probably have to be a DM mad completist to get any sort of pleasure out of this but I think it would be better to stick with the studio albums.....after all live albums are usually nothing gimmicks to all but those who went to the gigs themselves. Pity the video didn't show the concert in full.......that would have been interesting to watch ( live videos are usually much better than live CDs )
B00004Z459|5.0|This is an awesome CD. Now you may thing that just a Limp Bizkit clone or something, because of listening to LP on the radio, but there are some key factors that Linkin Park has that Limp Bizkit doesn't. First of all anybody can get LP's CD's without the CD having to be cut, and that matters to me because I'm only 13. Also LP has a lot of different sounds in their music, instead of just rap or what ever. Now, I'm not trying to dis Limp Bizkit, but in my opinion LP is just better. There's a lot of mixing and rapping(Mike Shinoda) and &quot;screaming&quot;(Chester Bennington) as my mom puts it. Somehow all this comes together to make great music and if you like all the this I just mentioned then I suggest that you get this CD.  See ya on the flip side.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's masterful new offering, The Da Vinci Code, is an intellectually stimulating and pulse-quickening triumph. The combination of completley unanticipated plot twists, fascinating artistic and historical facts, and the stunning manner in which Mr. Brown interweaves and interprets them is a monumental achievement. It is truly a rare offering that is both highly readable, educational, and extremely addictive.<br />This is a book that should appeal to anyone looking for a rare item: a thrilling page-turner that is both accessible to anyone but that does not insult anyone's intelligence. It will pump you full of adrenaline and knowledge. The Da Vinci Code will be the book that everyone is talking about for great reasons.<br />If they havent already!<br />Congrats Mr. Brown, your book was a pleasure to read!
B000069CWE|5.0|This CD is excellent. This has some of the best mixes I've ever heard. Some of the songs might start out slow but end up getting really good. The songs High Voltage and My December are remixes from Hybrid Theory EP, which is an unreleased CD as far as I know. Personally I think that the remixes of High Voltage and My December are even better than the originals. This CD is enhanced so that you can watch the Pts. Of. Athrty video on your computer. The only down side to this CD is that there aren't any lyrics, but you can easily find them on the internet. This CD is one of my favorites and if you like a lot of emcee type stuff, you know scratches and mixes and all that, you'll probiblly love this CD. So suggest that you get this CD really soon, it's great.<br />P.S. Any Linkin Park fan should get this CD because it be a perfect addition to any CD collection, and oddly enough even some Linkin Park fans haven't heard of this CD, as though it was rare.  See ya on the flip side.
B00005JLR2|4.0|The artwork is good, but its not the best. A lot of computer animation is used, instead of acutal hand drawn work. Which is another sign of how the Disney artists are getting more lazy.<br />There is only one song played during the movie. Fortunaltly, that song is very good, it is not irritating.
1576751988|1.0|I don't write a lot of reviews, and I depend on Amazon reviews to help me have honest, non-biased opinion to help me spend my money. In that spirit, let me say that &quot;Eat That Frog&quot; is a complete waste of money. There are a number of  good books on procrastination out there, but this book is not one of them.<br />What ideas this book may contain can all be gleaned from the reviews already written here on Amazon. There's actually more substance in some of them than in the entire book itself. I found myself shaking my head and angrily turning every page, frustrated that Tracy could get away with publishing a book so completely devoid of content. Fortunately this book is short; it deserves to be a pamphlet. A very short pamphlet. <br />That's not completely fair. The book has content, but it's either embarrassingly common sense, or startlingly unoriginal. Add in the fact that Tracy writes like, well, a second-tier motivational speaker and there you've got it. For example, here's a sentence from chapter 9, &quot;Refuse to allow a weakness or lack of ability in any area to hold you back.&quot; Does that motivate you? Does it help you in any way? Me neither. Fill 113 pages with large type and a lot of white space with this empty, thoughtless, and above all condescending blather and you, too, can write a motivational book.<br />Oh, and don't forget to fill ten pages with blatant self-promotion (&quot;Double your income, Double your time off!&quot;) just to beef up the page count and make the book a little thicker. <br />Perhaps you really are a desperate procrastinator (like myself) who's looking for someone to help him out of his overwhelmingly negative habits. You want to find a book to help? I'll recommend two: Rita Emmett's &quot;The Procrastinator's Handbook&quot;, which, while not original is at least honest and readable, which is more than you can say about &quot;Frog.&quot; <br />Perhaps on the top of the list is David Allen's &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; which is the absolutely best, most practical, applicable, and sustainable system for overcoming procrastination I've ever read. And it's not even a book specifically about procrastination. Yet it works. Magic. Based on the advice in &quot;Getting Things Done&quot; I've finished my bachelor's degree -- 14 years after I first enrolled in college.<br />The short of it: don't waste a nickel on &quot;Eat That Frog&quot;, and spend you money on one of many much, much, much better books. You deserve it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I just listened to &quot;In the Zone&quot; for the first time and I cannot stop dancing.  Britney sounds better than in her previous effort &quot;Britney&quot;.  All the tunes are very catchy and great to move to.  This CD is definetly a different Britney Spears than what we are used to!  She has reinvented herself again!
6301763041|4.0|Well the film was splendid and beautiful.  The acting finely wrought.  However, I detected a note of racism in it which qualifies for FOUR stars, instead of five.  Traci Lords was very moving in her portrayel of a lovely girl.  Johnny Depp was startling for his musical abilities.  Great film.
0553582445|3.0|Finding Hobb's &quot;Assassin's Apprentice&quot; and the two books that followed it were like rediscovering fantasy all over again. With the genre so flooded by Robert Jordenesque tripe, those three books stand out as wonderful, moving, masterful works. And yes, folks, let's face it, the end of the trilogy -- despite those dangling hints and untied threads -- was *perfect*. It wasn't Hollywood. It wasn't necessarily happy. But it was right. It was an ending that left you with a lump in your throat, an ending that was true to all that had come before. The only way it should have, and could have, ended. Lovely. (I mean really, even though it's hard to but a good series down, do we really want them to extend ad nauseum a la Mr. Jordan?) By picking Fitz's story back up in this series Hobb has done the character and the original series a disservice. Have to say that, as much as I like this author.<br />On another level, this first in the new series is engaging and a good read, and in some way's Fitz's new maturity fits (and it others it doesn't, is too easy). Same however can't be said of the second (Tawny Man book 2).<br />In the final analysis, keep supporting this author but if you loved the first three Fitz books... ...you should let the story rest where it is supposed to, in that lonely cabin, with Fitz and Nighteyes waiting to make their dragon.

B00005JMFO|5.0|It's funny how every critical (journo) review I've read in any newspaper, magazine or website has slandered the movie and called it cheap, repetitive and overtly sweet. Conversely, every member of the cinema audience (at least for the show I went to) came back with a smile on their lips and a slight skip in their step.<br />I think the mark of a good movie can be that while watching it you always want just a little more and don't want the movie to end. Love Actually has that effect on the cinema audience. <br />If you don't nitpick and try to analyse why the guy standing on the left side of the 74th scene has the 6th button of his shirt unbuttoned (i.e. just sit back and enjoy it) you will not come back dissatisfied.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|Pink gets back to her &quot;in your face&quot; roots with Try This.  While I didn't love all the songs on this disc, I loved the style in which she delivered them - Raw and No Holds Barred.  She has Janis Joplin quality in this record, not being afraid to rasp words and phrases; curse and be blunt.  If you are looking for dancy and more mild material like &quot;Mizunderstoodz&quot;, look elsewhere. <br />The track that really did it for me was &quot;God Is A DJ&quot;.  I listend to this song for an hour straight and still wasn't tired of it.  Superb lyrics, great chord structure and progressions; and pleasing background vocals made this the STAR on the disc.  I also enjoyed: Last To Know, Waiting For Love, Trying To Hard, Humble Neighborhoods and, of course, Trouble.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by this disc.  Raw, yet charming :)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I honestly do not understand what all the big commotion of  the content of this album. People always put words in her mouth; many times she has said that she is not an artist, but an entertainer - that is the point of Britney Spears. So called &quot;critics&quot; always want to categorize her music as trash, but why does music always have to be depressing? She loves to make fun music and that is what this album is, fun.  She does not want to sweep the grammys this coming year, she wants to please all her fans with a great album. And one of the other annoying things is that people says that she is not original and then there are here counterparts who say this. Um, singer songwriters procclaim originality, but the only original out there now, is Britney. No one wants to be like her, cause they cannot be her well enough with the complaining.<BR>The title track &quot;Me against the music&quot; is like a declaration of the two biggest things in music coming together and making a statement and they sure did, becuase who has not commented in any way on what happened this past August between the two of them? But pretty much every track is awesome. My favorites are &quot;Touch of my hand&quot;, &quot;Breathe on me&quot;, &quot;Showdown&quot; because I love one of the parts of the song where she says - I don't want to be a tease, now wont you undo my zipper please - and that phrase is priceless, basically telling everyone who was unsupportive to shove it. But all tracks are great, that one is just the standout. Priceless album. Bottom line is if you want a fun album that will just make you happy than this is the album, and if you don't and want to listen to other music than you do and that is all there is to it.  Britney made a classic in terms of fun and entertaining music. And everyone just stop with all the, she is a role model shpeal and what are all the little girls going to think.

0743243307|5.0|In American culture, Nazneen, the Bangladeshi protagonist of Ali's debut novel, might be called passive aggressive. When displeased with her husband, she balls his dirty socks up and puts them back in the drawer. Or lets the razor slip when she cuts his corns, drawing blood. Not that he notices. Chanu, like many busy, ineffectual men, hasn't a clue.<br />Nazneen lives her life by the precepts of her mother's favorite story of her: \\"How You Were Left to Your Fate.\\" She was stillborn, then breathed but refused the nipple. Her mother refused medical help, family advice. Instead, she waited. God would decide.<br />In the first chapter, Nazneen's path is charted: \\"What could not be changed must be borne. And since nothing could be changed, everything had to be borne. This principle ruled her life. It was mantra, fettle, and challenge. So that, at the age of thirty-four, after she had been given three children and had one taken away, when she had a futile husband and had been fated a young and demanding lover, when for the first time she could not wait for the future to be revealed but had to make it for herself, she was as startled by her own agency as an infant who waves a clenched fist and strikes itself upon the eye.\\"<br />The story begins with Nazneen's arranged marriage at 18, after her sister Hasina's shameful elopement, to a man living in London. Ali, herself born in Bangladesh, skillfully conveys the loneliness and bewilderment of a village girl in a block of flats teeming with immigrants. Chanu wants her to live a traditional indoor life, though she has none of the traditional family support. She keeps her feelings to herself, finds ways to obey the spirit, if not the letter of his will. Her best friend is loud, cigarette-smoking Razia who defies respectability and speaks her mind out loud.<br />Then her sister's \\"love match\\" collapses, and Hasina flees her abusive husband. A woman alone in Bangladesh is by definition in danger. Nazneen is desperate for her husband to act, but he does not. This bitter time, and her small revolts, further shape her marriage and Nazneen's inner turmoil is a secret from her husband, fostering larger betrayals.<br />Letters from Hasina, though they sometimes read like a device for conveying the growing turmoil in Bangladesh, and a woman at the mercy of her patriarchal Muslim culture, further underscore the divide in Nazneen's marriage. But Chanu, though he may be an intellectual dreamer, incapable of action, is a good-hearted, kind man who loves his wife.<br />Eventually, her daughters Westernized and rebellious, Nazneen gives in to passion, taking a lover from among the burgeoning radicals in the community - young people born to a Bengal culture in a new country. Torn between Western temptations and family traditions, beset by racist resentment and fear, they cleave to Islamic fundamentalism in a complex mix of anger, pride and preservation.<br />When, at last, she asks Karim why he chose her, he says she is \\"the real thing,\\" a village girl who doesn't dance in short skirts or wear the burkha and \\"ARGUE.\\"<br />Ali's eloquent, deceptively simple prose underscores the complexity of her world. Her dialogue is pitch perfect and her characters express themselves equally strongly in their silences, their gestures, their grooming, and their posturing. Her multi-faceted portrayal of post-September 11 reactions segues into a personal resolution that remains in doubt until the last page. A thoughtful, involving and beautiful debut.and to act, but he does not.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Track-by-Track Review:<br />1. Me Against The Music featuring Madonna - Probably one of the worst songs off the album. It was a good single for the kick off with of course, Madonna, but you're sick of it by the time you get the album. 6/10<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom featuring The Ying Yang Twins - This is a great R&amp;B song. I think the choice of the Ying Yang Twins wasn't too great, because I think that their raps are complete trash. Despite the rap, this song deserves applause. 8/10<br />3. Showdown - This song ventures off into more of a Caribbean beat. It's very daring. I'm not exactly feeling the coo-ing in the verses, but the chorus is pure gold. 7/10<br />4. Breathe On Me - Everyone says this is the highlight of the album, but I'm not too sure of it. It sounds kind of like Kylie Minogue's Can't Get You Out Of My Head. I don't think that Britney's voice is very fit for dance/trance tracks. A good try. 7/10<br />5. Early Mornin' - I think that Britney's choice to collaborate with Moby was fantastic. I'm not exactly a Moby fan, but the outcome of the alternative Early Mornin' is definitely fantastic. My only reccomendation is that Britney could have sung a little louder so the backup singers wouldn't swallow her up. 9/10<br />6. Toxic - I first heard this on her MTV Special, and this song persuaded me to buy the album. This is very unique and completely caught my attention. I'm not sure what makes it so great but it's the highlight of the album. 9/10<br />7. Outrageous - R. Kelly's urban masterpiece is also a highlight. Even though the lyrics are a bit pushing-it, it sure is a sign of Britney's maturity. Outrageous breaks the hip-hop line and by far stays behind it. 9/10<br />8. Touch Of My Hand - Thanks but no thanks. I think it's a try at nothing and a big miss. 3/10<br />9. The Hook Up - The Hook Up competes with Eastern-flavored beats and contaigous reggae. This song is original and a best. It's a great example of that Britney can try new things and succeed at the fullest. 8/10<br />10. Shadow - I don't know what it is, but on this album I'm just not in  the mood for ballads. I don't think that this song at all excelled what it was meant to win over. Yeah, OK I'll give her some credit for co-penning it, but otherwise I'm not interested. 4/10<br />11. Brave New Girl - Britney sure is brave on this track. She starts rapping at the beginning (which I think is pretty good, if I do say so myself), but then it just goes away and it turns into this tune you'd hear on the ...Baby One More Time album. So it's mediocre. I thought the whole point of this album was to grow up. 7/10<br />12. Everytime - Ahhh...now we enter the world of touching ballads. This song is very nice and is a perfect end. It is without a doubt Britney's best work of songwriting off this whole album and that stinker Dear Diary (see Oops! I Did It Again). Good job, Brit. 8/10<br />13. Me Against The Music (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix) - I personally prefer it over the original, but most people aren't interested. It is a superb remix (actually one of the best I've ever heard) and it doesn't drag on for 10 minutes. 9/10<br />Overall, 7.2/10. Pretty good but could've been better. Too bad there's no enhanced section, etc. I can't exactly whether you should buy it or not because everyone should find out for themselves. This is a love or hate situation and you could go either way on IN THE ZONE.
1565123875|5.0|\\"Things started to fall apart at home when my brother, Jaja, did not go to communion and Papa flung his heavy missal across the room and broke the figurines on the &eacute;tag&egrave;re.\\" This first sentence sets out all the main elements of this debut novel.<br />Narrator Kambili, 15, and her older brother, Jaja, live a life of privilege in Enugu, Nigeria. Their father, Eugene, is not only a wealthy industrialist, and devout Catholic, but also publisher of an outspoken newspaper, critical of the repressive regime.<br />But the glittering exterior hides a rotten core. Eugene, a religious fanatic and Anglophile who despises the old ways to the extent of repudiating his traditionalist father, indulges a sadistic abusiveness when his family fails to live up to his impossible standards. He is always sorry, afterwards, for what they made him do.<br />Then her aunt and cousins visit. \\"Every time Aunty Ifeoma spoke to Papa, my heart stopped, then started again in a hurry. It was the flippant tone; she did not seem to recognize that he was different, special. I wanted to reach out and press her lips shut and get some of that shiny bronze lipstick on my fingers.\\"<br />And when Eugene is persuaded (against his better judgment) to let the children visit his sister, a new world opens to them. This is no surprise, but Adichie's portrayal of the awakening - amidst a time of political turmoil and fear - is halting and fraught with danger.<br />Replete with beauty and horror, Adichie's novel of self-hatred, fear, and family, with its political/allegorical overtones, is a moving, sometimes breathtaking, debut.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|You know there is a sort of good sence about a movie when they make a sequel. Most of the time you hear stuff like, &quot;This movie was good, but not as good as the original.&quot; I'd like to clear up the stereotypes and tell you that this movie is good, and possibly better than the original.<br />Wesley Snipes is back, as one of the coolest heros ever. He fights these Vampires with silver weapons and practically decimates all. This time, we have friends and enemies pair up. Now alot of movies have this happen but can't pull it off because they grow emotionally attatched. The little love story is pretty good because Blade doesn't go all soft and crap. Then there is the other guys.... Brilliant. Especially that one dude who was in Alien Ressurection. He played a great villian in this movie.<br />Anyways, the action is better than the first. There are new breeds of vampires and the special effects team did an awesome job. Only 2 parts of 2 fight scenes looked to be done in all CGI(This one part where blade does a flip with a sword really fast and this other part where this guy trys to stomp him). Anyways, the movie does a great job of having Blade kill guys. And when Blade kills someone, you can honestly cheer because it will be awesome.<br />Also, the dialogue and character interaction is some of the best. We like seeing characters talk because it isn't all one-liners or all philosophy crap. <br />I hope people will see past the comic book and the original blade... This is an awesome movie. It isn't scary(when I watched it on Encore it said the movie was &quot;Horror&quot;) but it is pure action in a good way. Its enjoyable though, so have fun watching it, and buy it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Upon first playing Let it Be...Naked, you begin to realize that this is what these songs were meant to be. Raw and unadorned is how Apple/Capitol describes it, and that is exactly what this album was written to be. From the beginning of \\"Get Back\\" to the end of \\"Let it Be\\" you will agree that this is the good stuff. Buy it today for yourself, and for your friends and family too.<br />Endnote: The Let It Be...Naked version of \\"Two of Us\\" is quite possibly the best Beatles song ever!!!
0780624890|5.0|I still love this movie. I remember renting the DVD and asking myself why I didn't see this movie in theatres.<br />Basically Blade rules. He fights Vampires with more new-age weapons. He has an awesome sword, and some high-tech weaponry(kinda like Batman). Anyways, Blade has to fight these vampires. He is a vampire himself and is basically better than every vampire out there. Its cool now though because the hero is the stongest, and not the villian.<br />The movie is great. I can't really describe how awesome Blade makes the vampire genre. I mean cmon, who here can honestly say that they watched Dracula 2000 happily? I stopped watching it because it was stupid. In this movie, Blade has to fight this one dude called Frost. The names are cool, and im not being sarcastic. Anyways, Frost wants to unlock the powers of these mysterious scriptures. Blade kinda meets Frost and you know it's going to be awesome. Theres no wooden stake crap in this one...<br />Blade keeps you going. Hes got alot of action, and when a vampire dies they basically dissinegrate in the coolest way possible. I would buy the movie, and see Wesley Snipes cut guys up with swords, boomerangs, explosives, and guns.

B000022TSY|5.0|How to make a movie with almost no money ? Watch Easy Rider ! It's a terrific journey ! The story is simple but the actors (if they really are ;) are really fantastic. The Nicholson performance is unforgettable. EASY RIDER is a CULT movie and it still explains very well how the US society was in the 70's. Try to get the 30th anniversary remastered version including a very funny retrospective documentary to better understand the whole concept of Easy Rider.A once in a life !
B0000DJZA5|5.0|First of all, I will restate what another reviewer said, that being 1)We have ALWAYS had to deal with different versions of the same album, and 2) No one said the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; is going off the market, or that this is meant to replace it!<BR>That being said, this is a great album.  It is a nice reworking of the original core material, and gives us a nice taste of what it would have been like if they had not abandoned it, and had actually made it into an album that followed the &quot;White Album&quot;. And it all seems very fitting when you listen to it in that respect.  It is a nice &quot;what if...&quot;, only now we have it, don't we?  It will fit in quite nicely on my shelf, between the &quot;White Album&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, followed of course by the original &quot;Let It Be&quot;.  The admitted charm of the original version - the studio chatter, &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, and &quot;Dig It&quot;, will never be lost.  One simply needs to put the original version of the album on to experience it!  But, the &quot;cleaning up&quot; of the songs, and most importantly, the removal of Phil Specter's, in my opinion, over-production makes this a very nice listen indeed.  I will give credit where credit is due however, Phil Specter is the one who turned hours and hours of tape into a very respectable, final Beatles album... but I could have done without all of the &quot;extras&quot; that he decided to smother the album in.  This new version gives us more of a taste of what they were originally after with this material - a rock &amp; roll band getting back to the basics of being just that - a rock &amp; roll band. <BR>Is this the definitive version??  That's a matter of taste, and as a credit to the Beatles, there are literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions,  of people who feel that &quot;this or that should have been included or done&quot; or &quot;this or that should NOT have been included or done&quot;.  And yes, frankly, considering the hours of tape we have to work with, one could come up with quite a number of different versions of this album if he wanted to.  <BR>Am I gonna still listen to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot;?  You bet your ass I will... that's a freaking classic... no denying that.  But I will now play &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; just as often... depending on my mood.  Just like when I decide between the American or British &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; or &quot;Revolver&quot;, or shall I listen to &quot;Meet the Beatles&quot; or &quot;With the Beatles&quot;.... it's all GREAT!!!!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This album was released in 1981.  I listened to it again last night after not hearing it for a long time.  It was great then and it is great now.  I still get chills from Dave's laugh in &quot;Unchained&quot;:  &quot;HAAAAAA-HA-HA-HAAAA!&quot;  It's bleak, it's dark, it's one of the best rock records ever.
B000005QH3|5.0|Vanishing Point has this effect on you that can't be explained.  I have watched this movie over a hundred times in the 1980's.<br />Kowalski drives his white Dodge Challenger ( Colorado plates OA5599)  from Denver to California.  Lot's of high speed car scenes with police cars in pursuit of the man.<br />Just today I saw a clip on TV (Audioslave - Show me how to live) that is a remake of VP.  Actually some scenes are from the movie itself.<br />Movie with a cult following no doubt.
0880796863|4.0|This is my favorite of the Rider Waite Smith decks. The lines and detail are very clear and crisp.  That makes a difference.  Look at the Knight of Swords.  In other RWS decks, the corner of the horse's mouth is going down and it looks like the horse is looking backwards.  The horse looks apprehensive.  In this deck, the lines for the horse's mouth and eyes are cleaner.  The horse looks like he is grinning and happy to be charging ahead.<br />I like the colors used, but they may not appeal to everybody.  The colors are beige, light green, red and yellow.  No blue.  The green makes the reds pop.  I also like the thick lines and the bold, flat shapes. The backs are a pretty light blue and white design with roses. <br />I know this deck might not appeal to everyone.  This is why there are so many versions of the RWS deck out there.  For me, the original is the best.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|After following Britney's career from the beginning of \\"Hit Me Baby (One More Time...)\\" throughout the scandals up until now, I have to say that I have enjoyed this CD. <br />Yes there are many, many, MANY embarassing attempts at, what I like to call, \\"Madonna moments\\" in which she processes her  voice to sound like Madonna's voice in a few songs. And yes, her references to her new found sexuality that she seems to find abosouletly nescessary to publicize, are what some would call distasteful. But if you are truely looking for a club \\"ass-shaking\\" album, this is it.  Despite strange and overly sexual lyrics, this the album you pop in the CD player and dance to if your at home alone and high. (I'm kidding about the drug-reference of course.)<br />Even though guest appearances by P.Diddy, R.Kelly, the Ying Yang Twins, Madonna, Moby, The Matrix, don't make up for the lack of genuine singing and songs, the beats made by these guys are in the words of a friend, \\"so hot they rock your socks off.\\" <br />Buy a CD, play it once in the car, and you'll be unable to get the songs out of your head. (They're programmed to do it.) Not the best CD ever, but the \\"Best\\" of Britney so far. Try it. If you don't like it, you're guranteed to enjoy at least two songs. I know I do.
B00003CXAT|5.0|Steven Speilburg has changed us all. He's kept us out the water for nearly 30 years with JAWS, He's helped us make contact with CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, He's taken us on a journey with Indiana Jones to find the ark of the covenunt with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK,he's introduced us with a friend 300 million lightyears away in E.T. and now he's brought us to a remote island and showed us the most majestic yet terrifing creatures that we could only see in fragments of our imagination with JURASSIC PARK. JURASSIC PARK is probably one of the greatest movies of all time and it's the 7th top grossing box-office hit in movie history. Dinosaurs them selves astound us. Even their fossil remainments haunt us and awe us with their great sizes and shapes of many assortments. <br />The DVD of Jurassic Park is rather good. With over 75 minutes of behind the scene features and featurettes. But it needs some improvments. It sould have been produced under the DTS sound system rather than DOLBEY DIGITAL. DTS has clearer and crisper sound and the picture has alot more quality. So try to by the DTS standard if you can. Eitherway the dvds are the same just different quallity of sound. <br />Now you now the story, peolple on Island, park on island, people in park, park has dinosaurs, dinosaurs get out of park, people get chased by dinosaurs, dinosaurs eat a couple of people, and the remaining people get of the island and all the dinosaurs die. Okay? But otherwise than having good visual effects, fun roller coaster plot, and good actors, JURASSIC PARK has a fonominal soundtrack. John Williams has brought us THE JAWS SAGA, STAR WARS SAGA, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, INDIANA JONES TRILOGY, SUPERMAN, JFK, E.T., and of cource the JURASSIC PARK TRILOGY. The themes have that authentic John Williams style with it's exciting and thrilling yet sailient themes. Expessualy the end when the Helicopter flies into the sun set. A slight piano conceirto fades into a majestic and most absolutly beutiful orchestra ensemble then later into the triumphent trumpet/french horn fanfare and the into a mysterious end with a deep euphonium and piano ending . The music is wounderfull and with out John William's tallent for writing motion picture scores it wouldn't have been truly JURASSIC PARK.(while your here on Amazon.com buy the sound track while your at it.)<br />So, its got amazing special effects, fun plot, great cast, and a monumental soundtrack. This is JURASSIC PARK (hum the themes now.)
B00009TB5G|5.0|This dvd is just as wonderful as the extended edition of the Fellowship of the Rings. Fans of the books will be delighted by the extended scenes. As a huge movie fan, I found the special features wonderful, as they go through the whole filmmaking process. Hail to the crew and cast of these movies, who have made film history with this monumental achievement!
0393057240|5.0|Finally.  I no longer have to worry about buying a new paperback copy of this book every three months or so; this has always been a book that I've frequently enjoyed going back to multiple times after finishing...and now we've finally got a version that is built to last.<br />Most likely you've already seen the movie before deciding whether or not to read the book.  Be forewarned, however; John Hodge's screenplay is a masterful job of bringing continuity to a series of stories that are in fact only loosely related.  The book &quot;Trainspotting&quot; is comprised of a series of short stories previously published independently in various periodicals over a stretch of time...the stories deal with the same core of characters, but that is really all that ties them together.  You will probably find that Danny Boyle's job of directing the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; movie looks even more impressive after reading even a quarter of the book.<br />The book does focus on a set of wrong-side-of-the-track friends involved with drugs, alcohol, petty crime, and anything else they can find to take their minds off their completely unfulfilling lives.  An added challenge (and a fair extent of the book's charm) is that the book's dialogue and first-person narrative are written in the author's native Edinburgh dialect, making the book perhaps more accessible to Robert Burns scholars than the average non-Scots English speaker.  However, there is a glossary in the back of the book that is rather helpful...and my personal recommendation is to read the book out loud whenever possible (I don't know why, but whenever I did this, the written words made more sense when heard as an audible accent).<br />If you liked the movie at all, the book is for you.  As with most books that are adapted to the screen, you'll find a level of depth in the book that the film simply could not attain due to time and budgetary constraints; Spud onscreen is presented as a cross between Spud and &quot;Second Prize&quot; in the book, and there are book characters who aren't even introduced in the film (yet who also bring added depth to a world that is portrayed as rather one-dimensional in the film).  Choose life, choose a job, choose a career..but most importantly, choose this book.  It will add a whole 'nother level of appreciation to the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; experience.uot; in the book, and there are book characters who aren't even introduced in the film (yet who also bring added depth to a world that is portrayed as rather one-dimensional in the film).

B0000E1WNV|1.0|The worst sounding recording I have ever heard. I have some old recordings of Robert Johnson from the 30's that sound better. The audio techs on this one were out to lunch. Now I know why the DVD was so cheap. At 13.99, I got robbed.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|What on Earth is all the fuss about? The 1970 version of \\"Let It Be\\" isn't being withdrawn, there is simply a second (legitimate) version available now. Back in the old days, all of the Beatles albums came out in two versions -- stereo and monaural -- and they were different from each other. Then the British LP's started surfacing in the U.S., and THEY were different! When the Beatles catalogue finally made it to CD, some beloved old mixes (\\"Beatles For Sale\\" in stereo, \\"White Album\\" in mono) were consigned to oblivion and/or the bootleg market, where \\"Get Back\\" has been kicking around in sundry incarnations since 1969. My first copy was a horrid sounding vinyl LP with the title rubber stamped on an otherwise plain white jacket. Since then we've been blessed with endless upgrades and nearly all of the attendant outtakes, jams and conversations. We've heard the Glynn Johns acetates, the complete rooftop concert, Sweet Apple Trax, As Nature Intended, The Get Back Journals, and the version all of us put together using tracks from Anthology 3. The latest of these just happens to be the best-sounding and least expensive of the lot. Thanks, Paul. You passed the audition.
B00005JM02|5.0|I would just like to start out saying that this movie is not scary.  If your child is scared during this movie, then your child has problems.  Wow, a fish dies in the movie.  Woop-tee-doo.  Are you suggesting they rate it R?  If you can't handle the death of an animated fish then I would hate to see you when your relatives die. I'm out.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is one of those CDs, like Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" or Madonna's \\"Erotica\\" that just takes you by surprise. Yeah, she's been given the title of the Queen of Pop but when you look at the music biz today, pop really isn't what it was when started. Is this some joke of an album? Not at all. Should it be taken lightly? Most definately not. Britney Spears steps out on this one and really brings on the music and I must say, this is by far one of the best CDs she's put out. My top picks and why it's worth your money (yes, your money and not downloading it):<br />1)Me Against the Music feat. Madonna: This one grows on you. It's a fun song and the lyrics are fun to listen to. The beats, words, everything about this song will get you going.<br />2)(I Got that) Boom Boom - People have had different opinions but this is one fun song from the start. It's different from her other material, having a less pop and more R&B/rap like vibe to it.<br />4) Breathe on Me: This is beyond anything she's done. If \\"Oops I Did It..\\" was a great pop song, this one will surprise you. Yes, it's sensual, but it is in the same line of great songs like Madonna's Erotica or Human Nature.<br />7) Outrageous: Britney meets R. Kelly. Really, he wrote this song and it's not the same Britney you're used to hearing. This is a more mature Britney and this one of those tracks that shows just how much she's grown since that first release.<br />8) Touch of My Hand: Think Cyndi Lauper's \\"She-Bop\\" updated 2003 style. Considering Britney's relationships, this is a rather interesting if not catchy sensual, sexy, sinfully good song.<br />12)Everytime: This is that ballad that we've come to expect from Miss Spears. It's a great way to end off her new material and leaves you feeling a mix of emotions, but knowing she's come a long way.<br />  Every track, regardless if mentioned, was good. There isn't one I'd skip over or yawn at. No, this is definately \\"In the Zone\\" and unlike some critics and ameture experts on music, this isn't some laughable joke or \\"missed opportunity\\" as I read somewhere. She's growing as an artist and if this album does anything, it sets her up for a rather interesting and always fun future in the music business. Just as how Madonna's experimented with different music types, or Mariah has moved from gospel to pop to R&B, this has a little of everything. And it is, in my opinion, a great success story. It has pop, trance, 80s, ... you need this CD. I'll leave it at that.erts on music, this isn't some laughable joke or \\"missed opportunity\\" as I read somewhere.

B000069HP6|3.0|1979 was a watershed year for cinema sci fi.  In that 12 months, audiences were treated to &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Star Trek the Motion Picture&quot;, and Disney's &quot;The Black Hole&quot;.  The fate of the first two examples are widely known: &quot;Alien&quot; became a pop-culture phenomenon, and &quot;Star Trek&quot; was a disappointing flop, relying on sequels to resurrect the franchise.<br />Yet surprisingly, it was &quot;The Black Hole&quot; that drilled itself into my consciousness and refused to leave.  The details of the spare plot are well-explained in the Amazon editorial review, so I won't bother re-hashing it.  Instead, I'll attempt to explain just WHY the film has stuck with me for so long.<br />1) Production design and overall tone:  This is the first Gothic sci-fi movie that I can recall seeing, and it may be the darkest movie ever released under the Disney banner (and it earned Disney's first-ever PG rating).  An evil killer robot?  The mysterious crew?  The fate of Anthony Perkins' character?  This CAN'T be a Disney picture!  Of course, when people refer to the production design of &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, they are usually talking about one thing, which deserves a whole separate topic below:<br />2) The USS Cygnus:  Most sci-fi fans have their favorite cinematic spacecraft, and for me the all-time greatest, hands down, is the Cygnus.  While the interior design is more Gothic Cathedral, the exterior is basically Gothic Industrial Revolution.  It resembles an interstellar Eiffel Tower, and in its own way is quite (intentionally?) reminiscent of the Nautilus from Disney's &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;.  And yet, it looks like a spaceworthy and plausible design.  Perhaps named in honor of the (then-suspected) black hole in the constellation Cygnus X1, both the ship model and interior sets were designed by Peter Ellenshaw, son of the great Disney effects artisan Harrison Ellenshaw (&quot;Mary Poppins&quot;).<br />3) Visual Effects:  It really steams me that some have called the VFX in this movie &quot;cheap&quot;!  By 1979 standards, they were magnificent (and Oscar-nominated), yet thanks to some unconventional methods, they largely hold up today.  Supposedly, the Cygnus model was so finely detailed that it couldn't be shot against a blue screen; so Ellenshaw photographed it live against a starfield painted on glass.  As a result, the space scenes still look good even on a bad video transfer (not the case with bluescreen movies like the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, where the travelling matte is now visible on some versions).<br />4) Weirdness:  Come on, what the hell is up with that ending?  Fantastic.<br />Of course, there were also several not-so-great things about this movie, namely some cheesy dialogue, and the disappointing abandonment of physics towards the end.  These aspects prevent it from being a four-star picture, but &quot;The Black Hole&quot; is absolutely worth a look from sci-fi and design fans, which were the original target audience anyway.  <br />&quot;There are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there are no old, bold pilots!&quot;
B0000CAQ27|1.0|EW! EW! EW! P!NK HAS NO TALENT ..... SHE IS UGLY ... SHE TRIES TO BE ALL ROCK COOL ........ HER SONG &quot;TROUBLE&quot; REMINDS ME OF OLD WESTERN MUSIC.<br />JUST EWWY!
B0000VAFO0|2.0|A skin tight leather clad Kate Beckinsale stars in this derivative mess which tells the story of a thousand year plus war between vampires and werewolves. Beckinsale is a vampire, or a \\"death-dealer\\", who hunts werewolves down. One night she discovers a group of them chasing a seemingly normal young man (Scott Speedman), followed by a plethora of derivative action scenes, campy over-acting, and one too many loose ends and plot holes. On the outside, Underworld is a stylish thriller that boasts a very attractive female lead, although Beckinsale's true acting talents aren't entirely put to use. Speedman is wasted as the hapless sap who just happens to be the right guy at the wrong time. The special effects (especially the werewolf transformations) are phenominal; these effects have come a long way since The Howling. Other than that though, Underworld is just a mess. The action scenes seem to be derivative hybrids of The Matrix, Blade, Resident Evil, The Crow, and a mess of other action/sci-fi/horror films. Plus, by the time the credits start rolling, we are left with one too many loose ends and questions, plus an ending epilogue that automatically opens the door for an inevitable sequel. All in all, Underworld had a load of promise, but in the end it is just another derivative thriller.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album wasn't her best, but it still turned out great! These songs are awesome!  I'm really glad to hear something new from Britney!

B0000TB03W|5.0|Chills will run down your back when you hear Shania sing especially on songs like It Only Hurst When I Breathe. Shania moves around the stage so much. The obvious joy the band has for the music they're playing will leave you wishing you loved your job nearly as much. The best part by far is Shania's interaction with the crowd who sing along to every tune. This dvd offers 105 minutes of sheer pleasure from start to finish.
B00000IL26|5.0|Lee Morgan was a true giant of bop and his trumpet playing on this record is representative of this man's amazing talent. Morgan's trumpet style was clean and hot . Every track on this CD is a winner.I love Morgan's work with Art Blakey too but this is the best work Morgan did as a bandleader. Joe Henderson compliments Morgan's searing trumpet style perfectly. It is impossible in my opinion to rank the great bop era trumpet players - Morgan, MIles, Clifford Brown, Fats Navarro and of course Dizzy are all stars in the firmament. Lee Morgan deserved his place in that company and the work he did on this collection assurred it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|For that hard to buy person. You can give them this dvd to show them what they're missing. Such as fantastic music an energizing performer, a charismatic band. What more could they ask for in a dvd!? The interaction with the crowd will leave them breathless!<BR>So pick this dvd UP! and drop it in someone you love's stocking
B000089RV6|5.0|I usually don't like rock like this; my rock includes bands that are loud, agressive and annoyingly heavy(Slayer, Megadeth, Pantera, In Flames, Testament, etc...) to highly progressive and technical(Black Sabbath, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, etc.)But you know what?; I bought this CD 10 years ago, and it hasn't left my car since. It's full of chugging, blues inspired grimy riffs that have yet to be equaled by many. And speaking of riffs, with the exception of Aerosmith's Joe Perry, has there been a guitarist that has created catchier and more memorable riffs than Angus Young? And who better to replaced the deceased Bon Scott than the equally fiery Brian Johnson? The classics are all here; Black In Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, Hell's Bells and the ultimate rock opinion statement, Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution. This album is the transistion from the silky balladry and pomp rock of the 70's bands like Led Zeppelin and Queen to the 80's raunch rock that countless hair bands adopted as their style. May albums have sold millions or records that were not worthy; this is not one of them. Buy the album and join the club; as a matter of fact, buy everything that AC/DC's ever written, you dumbass!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I couldn't be at the show in person but the dvd is the next best thing. Shania shows real feeling and passion when she sings all her songs but especially on She's Not Just a Pretty Face. When she goes down in the crowd to sing with those girls oh your heart will skip with the excitement they undoubtably feel. With the closeups on Forever and For Always you'll feel like Shania's singing directly to you.The perfect gift for any Shania fan!
B00001NFCY|2.0|I do like Creed, though many people have endlessly dissed them. Though the Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains and Stone Temple Pilots comparisons are obviously there, I do feel that the band has potential to created their own sound. Their first album, My Own Prison, dealt with Scott Stapp's childhood and adolescence in a highly religious family; the album contained a number of good songs. Their third and best CD, Weathered, shows maturity and range, much like the 1990's version of Metallica. Now comes the second and worst of the three albums, Human Clay. This album is downright unlistenable, with the exception of two songs, the singles Higher and With Arms Wide Open(GREAT bass work on both songs by Brian Marshall). For their next album, I hope they decide to take it to the next level, and not stay in mediocrity. Peace.
B0000TB03W|5.0|There is only one word to describe Shania Twain on stage Charismatic. She has the most incrediblely energy and stage presents.Watching the band perform Don't Be Stupid well lets just say the violins and steel guitar steal the show at least on this song. The audience reaction to the songs and Shania tell it all! Pure fun, joy and love for Shania and her music.
B000003TA4|5.0|One day about 11 years ago, I was watching Yo! MTV Raps; after the show ended, they showed this video which looked like a bunch of teenagers jumping around in a gymnasium, and three off color gentlemen playing in a band. I, much like many who were also watching at the time, were naive that we were watching history in the making.<br />Hair metal was on it's way out in the early 90's; though Guns N'Roses &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot; pointed hair metal in the direction of the door, Nirvana's Nevermind put the boot in their asses. This record is harsh and abrasive in some areas,and very smooth in others. While most people know them from Smells Like Teen Spirit, that is HARDLY the best song on the album; listen to Come As You Are(my favorite), In Bloom, Lithium, Drain You and Lounge Act, then listen to the radio; this record has been copied, abused and plagarized by many, MANY, less talented bands(Creed, Nickleback, The Calling, Puddle Of Mudd,etc...). Nirvana is one band that can truly say that one member is not more valuable than the others; the crisp, fast thrash metal inspired drumming of Dave Grohl and the robust and slightly muddy bass of Krist Noveselic(I'm partial to bass players since I am one)round out the piercing vocals and riffs of Kurt Cobain, though Kurt wasn't the most technical of guitarists. Most people call this the best grunge album of all time; that's not true since this isn't even Nirvana's best album(that honor belongs to In Utero, which IS the best grunge album of all time; sorry Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains fans), but its the most important album of the 90's hands down.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The lights go down Shania returns to stage after changing her outfit and sings From this Moment On its positively incredible and a must see. As is the rest of the dvd. It's just one incredibly energnic moment after another. Difinitely  a must for the Shania fan.

He has the style, the courage, the inteligence, and the voice, to say what he wants, speak his mind, and share all the sh** that he lived, letting us know that there's somebody else that went through the same, or something worse. I love rock and rock/pop, and oldies, rap is the last thing on my list, but for godsakes EMINEM is a genius, that's why he wins so many vma's every year, LONG LIFE TO SLIM SHADY!!!!!, and the marshall matters LP is a great album!!, also THE EMINEM SHOW, not too much of a fan of the first one but it's very good, keep on. Don't try to shut him, because he has the guts to speak his soul, I admire you EMINEM
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania always manages to come alive on stage like no other performer. Her interaction with the band is incredible. The way she brings the audience right into every single song. From the sound to the crystal clear pictures this is a must see dvd.
006091307X|4.0|With a mordant pen and an incisive wit Pynchon playfully attacks the epistemological naivetes of the credulous and anthropomorphic philosophy serving as the backbone for many of our conventional beliefs about our universe. His slyly allusive and intricately woven prose serves as the stylistic equivalent of a misleading, chaotic, and jumbled cosmos where the only certainties are interpretative freedom and ceaseless dubeity. It is a testament to Pynchon's genius that he's able pack his narrative with so many hints and glints of profundity that the ordinary reader, disorientated from the sheer speed with which disparate and seemingly irrelevant information is dispensed, never pauses to reflect upon the implications of adopting Pynchon's alternative perspective on knowledge and existence. <br />Characters are typically one of two things: either the particulate projections of the author's personality, or the hoppled slaves of a demanding and unifying idea thought up by a wily and self-absorbed member of the literati. Pychon's character clearly fall into the latter category, with plastic personalities and rigid, affectless actions the norm, and mawkish tenderness strictly verboten. The main character, Oedipa, whose likability depends entirely upon whether or not you automatically like or dislike persons you know nothing significant about, is named by a former paracoitus as the executrix of his will. After some initial fumbling she, with assistance from legal-eagle Metzger, embarks on a quest that involves her in the shady shenaningans of secret societies whose dealings with a deceitful and delusive postal service (Tristero) are never fully uncovered by either the protagonist or the reader. The recurrent clues involving the corniculate emblem of Tristero lead Oedipa on an epic journey through an artfully constructed constellation of ideas that leaves her mystified and nonplussed. As you've probably deduced by now, the arc of the plot is non-existent; concepts and abstractions supply the riverbanks to Pynchon's stream of consciousness rather than story and character development.<br />Recondite tralatitions, regardless of their underlying contents, are exquisitely pleasurable to encounter when they're properly executed, and Pynchon's novella Lot 49 is no exception. I extracted more than a modicum of pleasure ferreting out the solutions to the symbolic puzzles and ciphers he sportively sprinkled throughout his peripatetic text despite their aimless and arbitrary nature. While many readers will be nonplussed and perhaps repulsed by the inky ooze of the text itself, those readers who see not a turbid river but a limpid stream, the bottom of which has been inscribed with the generative principle of all of Pynchon's puzzle books, will find its perusal a thrilling oblectation. A purely cerebral indulgence, bereft, however, of all human tenderness and emotion (the point, of course, but a sorry point it is).<br />One feels compelled to provide a brief antiphon to those who would lump Vladimir Nabokov into the same literary category as Thomas Pynchon. Primo, Nabokov isn't a post-modernist in any way, shape, or form. He was an avowed believer in indivisible monism, and expressed his recognition in more than one of his texts of the logical necessity of their existing an irreducible medium of existence; secundo, Nabokov wished to indict injustice and cruelty, whereas Pynchon simply wishes to convey &quot;existential angst&quot; and a banal form of claustrophobia. T hey both concoct puzzles, sure, and they both mastered prose, but one's a genius and the other a trifling epigone.<br />I am indifferent to whether or not you purchase this book. If you enjoy puzzles and have a large working memory, go nuts; if not, your time would be better spend flipping through Grisham or King.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania in the 105 minutes of this dvd will show you what a true performer really is. Moving around stage like a true professional working the crowd into a frenzy than cooling them down with a romantic love song. Shania provides it all. It's a must have ! If you weren't a fan before this dvd will make you one.
B000005JA8|1.0|Believe the nay-sayers! <br />I am both open-minded AND enjoy experimental music. I tried, tried, tried to like this album. I've listened to it a dozen times. I've abused myself by listening to it 3 times in a row,<BR>I've taken a few years in between listens. I've made a concerted<BR>effort to fine one redeemable track on the disc but to no avail.<br />Save your money!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's sultry voice is enough reason to buy this dvd. The other reasons Shania's never ending energy. The way Shania interacts with her band and brings the crowd into each song she sings. One of the best moments is when for Thank You Baby! Shania brings in an orchestra to back her up. Just as Shania fans will say Shaniariffic!
B00005JLTM|1.0|When I first watched this movie after it came out, I was awe struck by the special effects. This movie has some of the best special effects ever created in a movie. The fight scenes were truely extroardinary, though the highway scene was over rated. When the fighting wasn't going on the story sequences left me wandering what they were even talking about. Just about everything in the movie besides the fight scenes is complete gibberish with no point in the movie. The whole dance rave, dirty scene, all the way through the meeting with the Architect, it's all a bunch of gibberish.<br />I left the theatre feeling confused because nothing was really solved or explained worth a flip. The biggest mistake in the movie is that it feels like it was based around fight scenes, instead of story. It should have been the other way around.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's energy is relentless! Her band plays magnificently. A guy proposes Shania sings When You Kiss Me right after certainly setting the mood. The audience goes wild with every note Shania sings! Shania even brings up three fans to help her sing I'm Gonna Getcha Good! Boy does she! Positively the way to bring in the holiday season. A little eggnog and Shania dvd to warm your heart!
B00000JGHM|5.0|Everyone and their grandma is in this one.  Pacino and De Niro alone are worth buying the DVD, and Kilmer and Company just add to the solid production of the movie.  Great action scenes, gripping story full of twists, and edge of the seat suspense.  Organized Crime movies don't better than this.  If you have a DVD player and a nice home theater system, crank up the volume during the bank robbing scene (you'll know what I'm talking about), and get blown straight outta your living room.  Heat is an absolute must have and one no DVD collection should be without.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Its A Good album. One song makes me feel all dizzy and &quot;drunk&quot; and thats &quot;Early Mornin'&quot;. She DOES have a good voice I actually believed the media on saying she had a bad one but they should get REAL she's got a good voice!// Yes, its true X-tina Aguilera DOES have a better voice but her album really is a different story. All of the songs get well, boring except all of the released so far. &quot;In The Zone&quot; poves that it is listenable. She has really improved I mean from &quot;Baby One more Time&quot; to &quot;Oops! I did It Again!&quot; to &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; to &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; she has slowly transformed to girly bubble-gum pop to R&amp;B beats to the music she is doing today so everyone can enjoy it. Some of her tracks are just really really amazing heres my ratings:<br />&lt;*&gt; -&gt; &lt;*****&gt; 1* being crap to 5***** being Excellent!<br />1. Me Against The Music Feat. Madonna &lt;*****&gt;<br />2.(I Got That) Boom Boom Feat. Ying Yang Twins &lt;****+&gt;<br />3.Showdown &lt;*****&gt;<br />4.Breathe On Me &lt;*****&gt;<br />5.Early Mornin' &lt;****&gt;<br />6.Toxic &lt;*****++!!!&gt;<br />7.Outrageous &lt;****+&gt;<br />8.Touch Of My Hand &lt;*****&gt;<br />9.The Hook Up &lt;***&gt; &lt;- One of the weaker ones off &quot;Zone&quot;<br />10.Shadow &lt;*****+!&gt; &lt;- It's like a ballad I really love it<br />11.Brave New Girl &lt;*****&gt;<br />12.Everytime &lt;*****+!&gt;<br />BONUS REMIX TRACK 13.Me Against The Music feat.Madonna Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha RemiX &lt;*****&gt;<br />OVERSEAS BONUS TRACKS:<br />14.The Answer &lt;*****+&gt;<br />15.Don't Hang Up &lt;****+&gt;<br />Well There It Is wonder if people agree if I condense this all I say ---&gt; GET THIS! IT IS SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OF HER ALBUMS THE SONGS ARE GREAT GO GET THIS ITS GREAT!&gt;<br />it beats &quot;STRIPPED&quot; HANDS DOWN!
B00003W8NM|5.0|After I saw Fight Club for the first time I just wanted to go out and beat the snot out of everyone I saw.  The story is so unique and mysterious that you will have no choice but to watch it all the way through.  Definitely not for the squeamish little girls out there.  Definitely for the testerone driven real men out there.  Pitt and Norton both turn in excellent performances and you even get a piece of Meat Loaf with boobies.  If that's not scary enough, wait 'till you see the ending.  Excellent movie and even better on DVD.
0385504209|5.0|I loved this book and, like many people, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend reading it. It is a thoughtful, well written, intelligently constructed novel. Dan Brown is either a genius, or had a great deal of help constructing the cryptography of this book. To those who view it with religious disdain I say this: It is a work of fiction and you know it. To create this world, Dan Brown has included some not quite truths that work with the internal logic of the story. That is fine, we expect that of an author. To those who disbelieve him, I say this: It is possible. Highly bloody unlikely, but possible. This is an incredible book-read it and judge it on its merits, but do not judge it without reading it.
B000069AUI|5.0|Those Brits know how to rock.  Coldplay's sophomore effort is every bit as introspective as the first.  Not all the tracks are particularly impressive, but &quot;Politik&quot;, &quot;In My Place&quot;, &quot;God Put A Smile On Your Face&quot;, &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;Daylight&quot;, and the grand &quot;A Rush of Blood To the Head&quot; are worth a lot more than the price of admission.  That leaves only 4 weak tracks, and they're decent as well.  Chris Martin is a great songwriter and has very impressive range in his vocals.  If you are reading this review and are thinking of buying this album, go for it, you will not be let down!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended version of The Two Towers is richer, flows more smoothly, makes more sense, fills in the blanks on missing motives of a number of characters, most notably Faramir and Eowyn, adds some important details about Aragorn. It provides more depth, background information, humor, and overall character development. Though many of the changes are small, they affected the way I interpreted scenes from the theatrical release, put a slightly different spin on things, making for a fuller experience. Which is not to say the theatrical release didn't hold together well - but the extended version is just a better film.<br />I'd like to add that I notice a number of people have commented on the disappointing editing done in the theatrical release - to be fair to Jackson, et al, I would say: Just remember the theatres make their money by having multiple shows. They probably limited the length of the film to get more showings in per day. It would take planning for an intermission and a greater commitment by theatres to fit in what is essentially a four-hour movie. I don't think that's intentional \\"dumbing down\\" for the audience, it is just a business decision a lot of us would rather they didn't have to make.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I did not like her other cd's but I LOVE this one.  Its a little more funky.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Hmm...it's now 2003, almost 2004, and this teen \\"pop tart\\" from 98' is, well, still kicking ass!  I thought she was supposed to be gone in a year or so, and that her 15 minutes of fame were up?...I thought that she was just a trend?  Isn't that what everyone was saying?...well, good think I didn't believe them, because she's back with her 4th album and shows no signs of \\"fading\\". This album is sure to debut at number 1 on the Billboard charts, making it yet another Britney album to debut at number 1...and also making her the only female artist to ever have ALL of her albums debut at number 1.  I've been reading some of the reviews, and really, I got a good laugh out of it....I mean, \\"Juvenile lyrics\\"?  did you actually LISTEN to the album?  Maybe a better question is \\"Did you understand and/or relate to it?\\"  Sure, if your in your 30's or older this album probably isn't for you...did you think it would be?  Sure some adults might like it, but really, most won't relate.  So what if it isn't \\"Deep\\" and \\"Meaningful\\"...did you expect it to be?...that's even funnier.  Time and time again, Britney has said that she doesn't like to complain about her personal problems on an album and that she likes to sing about having a good time and partying...hmm...sounds like a normal 21 year old to me.  The lyrics are better than her first effort \\"...Baby one more time\\" but that's only natural, she was 16 back then....I don't think a song like \\"Breathe on me\\" or \\"Touch of my hand\\" would have been appropriate at that time.  Again, this album is yet another step for Britney.  The bubble-gum sound is gone, except for \\"Brave new girl\\" which, while being a fun pop song, doesn't really fit on the album.  Let's face it, Britney's not for everyone, but if your a fun person, go out and get this album, you won't regret it.  Parents: It really depends on you if you want to get this album for someone under the age of 13...the lyrics are sexual, sure there are curses, but she obviously wasn't going to remain the same ol' Britney your kids grew to love....she's older, her fans are older, and she just might have outgrown some of her pre-teen fans.  This album is orignal, based on the fact that she didn't go R&B like every other popstar.  This album has a mix of genere's.  <br />\\"Me against the music\\" Feat. Madonna - 9/10<br />\\"(I got that)Boom, Boom\\" Feat. Ying Yang Twins - 9/10<br />\\"Showdown\\" 8/10<br />\\"Breathe on me\\" 10/10<br />\\"Early Mornin'\\" 10/10<br />\\"Toxic\\" 10/10 (very original)<br />\\"Outrageous\\" 10/10<br />\\"Touch of my hand\\" 10/10 - possibly my favorite track on the album<br />\\"The Hook Up\\" 8/10<br />\\"Shadow\\" 7/10<br />\\"Brave new girl\\" 7/10<br />\\"Everytime\\" 9/10<br />\\"Me against the music\\" the remix - 6/10...i'm not a big fan of remixes.
B000089RVX|3.0|Best band of all time ! Better than even ABBA and BUCK FIZZ joined together. The Singer is the best looking women in the world  wait wait wait ....  Galaxy . Its a real shame Lacuna Coil and Night wish and not to mention the Gathering and even After Forever haven't started making CD`s yet and I`m stuck in 2003 because my time machine has a busted a flux capacitor and I`m low on plutonium and I can`t get back to 1980 to tell my friends how (NEW) these guys sound. So get this CD and don`t miss the BUZZ before the next BUZZ comes along and your no longer COOL anymore, but wait what am I saying? Evanescence fans are not trying to be cool?  its GOTH isn`t it ? (In case  you don`t realize I`m being sarcastic) This has all been done before , its all been played before (better IMHO)  its just great bands like After Forever  never got the pop star attention,  so  whats new and exciting?  next ? KIDS   you decide I`ll let ya   (LOL). (how about a Mcdonalds add or a video game made after em)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Okay.  First off, I want to say that I know Brit doesn't have the best voice on the planet.  But come on, it's unique in it's own way.  I mean, her voice does the trick.  However, it is apparent that her strong suit is in her dancing.  The way she moves and performs is absolutely phenomenal, no questions asked.  Besides, I would like to see someone sing her high melodies while dancing the way she does.  Take that into consideration before you question her talent.  On a lighter note, this album is very good.  I have been a so-so fan of Britney's since her debut, but not completely infatuated with her music.  But this album completely changed that.  Every song is excellent.  I once said before that she shouldn't attempt to sing ballads, because I didn't think that her voice suited them well enough.  She sure did change my mind with 'Everytime' and 'Shadow'.  Wow.  Totally unexpected.  'Everytime' is an acoustic song, just piano and a synthesizer and strings with her voice.  Very very nice, Britney.  'Shadow' has a great melody, the chords are wonderful.  'Touch of My Hand'...hmm...well, this one will definitely make parents yank this CD out of their 8-10 year olds' cd player.  lol...It is a very good song, and I think she delivers the message tastefully, without making it a raunch-fest.  To all those people out there who think that this song is just a dirty-minded filler track, think again.  Masturbation is normal, and EVERYONE does it (once you discover it...lol).  And I completely stand with Britney on her opinions of little girls looking up to her, and her having to maintain her 'squeaky clean image'.  Is she ever going to be able to grow up?  She is 21, for God's sake.  When she turns 40, will parents still demand she wear pigtails and pink skirts and skip around singing 'Sometimes'?  Lord have mercy, people...get real.  Parents, if you don't want your child to listen to it, do your job as a parent and DON'T LET THEM.  Britney Spears is a performer and entertainer, not your goddamn babysitter.  Duh!  Jeesh, anyway.  lol...'Toxic' is an AWESOME dance cut.  Music is very edgy, just a very fun song.  '(I Got That) Boom Boom' with Ying Yang Twins was just pure genius.  What a collaboration!  Sounds like an unlikely and odd combination, but she pulls it off fantastically.  Bottom line - this CD has it all:  fun pop, edgy dance/reggae, bumpin' R&B, and beautiful ballads.  And the fact that Britney herself co-wrote most of the songs on this album just impresses me more.  This CD is definitely her best, and I think it will be hard to top it.  Good comeback, Brit ;)  And to all of you out there who think she is a 'talentless blob of pre-packaged teen-pop', listen to this album.  It will make you change your mind.
0385504209|2.0|This book reads like an action movie but without the benefit of any special effects to keep your attention. The concept of the plot is novel but the writing is poor and descriptions are lacking. Be sure to read this as long as you have nothing better to do.

B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta, as I'm sure you already know, contains 1/2 of ATDI's members. According to Cedric, he left because he felt they had reached somewhat of a musical stalemate and they would keep making &quot;the same album&quot;. &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot; is definitely not that. Although there are numerous comparisons (although somewhat well-founded) to ATDI's work, this music is all around different. There are, however, elements of ATDI's trademark post-hardcore sound, especially on tracks like &quot;Inertiatic Esp&quot; and to an extent in &quot;Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt&quot;. Not to say that this is a bad thing. &quot;Inertiatic Esp&quot; is one of my favorite tracks.<BR>More prevalent than the former musical elements are the inclusion on a somewhat more psychadelic approach. In areas the music is reminiscent of Led Zepplin and Cedric sounding like Geddy Lee. <BR>But The Mars Volta puts a much more modern twist on it. Combing frenetic sampler beats and distortion as well as almost Doors-esque jazz. <br />And of course, there is the brilliant, yet often inexplicable, lyrics. Self-admittedly selfish, Cedric lyrics cater to his own sensibilities with an attitude of &quot;If we get it, somebody else will&quot;. Knowing that the album is dedicated and based upon the life of Julio Venegas helps to act as a loose guide in decrypting some of the lyrics. Even those that one isn't able to annunciate the meaning of still have their own way of touching you in a very personal way. A way that couldn't have been put better. In these sense the abstract, occasionally disjointed nature of the lyrics acts simultaneously to both generalize and specify a particular emotion or event to the listener.<BR>All-in-all it is a brilliant album. It magneticly pulls the listener throughout the sonic landscapes they have created. And I loved it, every step of the way.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|This is one of my favorite albums of the year...it is what I listen to nearly every night when going to sleep.  She sounds so gorgeous on every song.  With the exception of some trite, cliched lyrics here and there, this album is near perfect.  I love first single \\"Fallen,\\" \\"Drifting,\\" \\"Train Wreck,\\" \\"Time,\\" and \\"Perfect Girl.\\"  My two favorite songs are probably \\"World on Fire\\" and \\"Answer\\" though.  \\"Answer\\" is one of the most beautiful love songs I have heard in a long time, and \\"World on Fire\\" just makes so much sense, and makes sense in such a beautiful way.  This song has some awesome electronic elements to it (throbbing notes and stuff like that...should definitely be remixed for the dance floors!)  Overall, I definitely like this one just as much as any of her previous work...she is one of my favorite (if not my favorite) female artists out there.  Its been too long since she had put something new out...but it was worth the wait!
B0000TB03W|5.0|As I watched the special I saw more life and action in Shania than I have seen before. There was more depth to her singing. The was also the found again joy of being in front of the people she loves to entertaine and make happy with her music. She has found a new level one that most singers never reach. She has climb and reached totally new hights with her music. She has proven over and over she is a true super star diva before but now no one can disagree that she is the new Queen of country music. Her songs can only be done by her and they inspire everyone who hears them. Live in Chicago is a mile stone.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|okay when baby one more time came out i was like &quot;man this gurl cant sing but the pigatils are cool!&quot; then what happened to the cutsie pop princess? she grew up? what no she didnt! she just started prostituting herself! literally she is a prostitute! her voice.. wait what voice.. anyways the thing she calls her voice doesnt sell records its her image! the onyl reason britney is ruviving in the industry is by taking off more and more clothes! shes just a waste of time and space in the music industry! Honestly GO AWAY BRITNEY!! she never could sing and she never will be able to sing. Me against the music has rave reviews but honestly, its nothing but a waste of millions of cds. beleive me dont buy it, my freidn has it, and she threw it in the garbage can. Its a waste of plastic, waste of time, and it kills the ears! do us a favour britney and go away!! LEAVE US ALONE! ure vapour! britney fans dont hate, appreciate and take in the truth! this cd deserved less than 1, 0 or negatives!

B00000JCOV|1.0|When this disc first hit the shelves, people were scurrying like mad-cap squirrels to get a taste of the &quot;knot&quot;. I mean, this 9 piece was being heralded as the new beatles!!! I remember having lunch with an associate from Capitol Records(not Slipknot's distributor)who told me this: &quot;These guys will sculpt a new nose onto the ever-changing face of rock&quot;.Here's the definitive skinny. These guys DID change the face of rock. They showcased the imbarrassing inevitability that sick minds could cordinate as a sick 9 peice ensemble and dress up in third rate wal-mart halloween masks and appeal to a nu(pun, sorry, couldn't help myself)generation of disenchanted teens who just wanted a lil' love. Well, the results were immediate. The band broke big thanks to a witless single(that actually sounds like a german shephard with hemoroids barking)and an accompying guest spot tour on the legandary Ozzfest(the high school dropout/poor mans version of summer shows)and so, here it is: HATE, HATE AND MORE HATE!!!<BR>If despair and pointless aggravated insanity pop your zits and scratch your itch, then this demonically contrived talentless Iowa unit are for you. 20 years ago, music like this would be sealed in the vaults of the exectutive's label and a note would come back to the band reading:<BR>&quot;Hello,<BR>So sorry we signed you guys. We don't want to take the heat for the inspiration behind imminent murders and suicides thanks to your record.<BR>Yours truly,<BR>so and so&quot;<BR>But, we live in a moral free society where crap like this gets heavy air-play and rotation-ready access at those moral darlings at MTV.<BR>My advice to you, dear reader:<BR> BUY DEMON HUNTER!NOW! SOLD HERE AT AMAZON!They are an alternative to Slipknot that rock much harder and faster and best of all...it actually EDIFYS the human spirit.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let It Be is an album by the Beatles which lost its way. Originally intended as the sound track for a film which would show the Beatles working on songs, writing, rehearsing then playing the finished product live to an audience, the album became an unwanted child with three accredited producers, a loss of interest by the Beatles themselves and a loss of focus by the ultimate producer - Phil Spector who in his attempt to present a finished soundtrack album, abandoned the original desire of delivering a pure unadorned, undubbed presentation of the songs.<BR>Let It Be Naked is an attempt to right the record (no pun intended) and present the songs without overdubs as The Beatles originally intended.<BR>This album soumds sharper, crisper and  cleaner than 'Let It Be'. It is much more raw as intended. The separation of the five instruments (remember the album features Billy Preston on keyboards) is excellent. The vocals on all the tracks are much clearer and more up front than on 'Let It Be'. On first play the album sounds very fresh. That being said though, there are elements of this album that are disappointing. The removal of 'Dig It' and 'Maggie Mae' is inexcusable - short inconsequential song parts are a feature of the later Beatle albums so why remove them? Furthermore, as these songs were part of the original album there is no valid reason for removing them.  The removal of the vocal and instrumental warm ups at the start of some of the songs (particularly 'Get Back'), lessens the live feel of the album and seems out of sync with the intention behind the album. On the other hand the inclusion of 'Don't Let Me Down' - John Lennons strongest track from the roof session (why was it not on the original album?) is very welcome.<BR>Overall the roof session songs are better on this album, the remixing of 'I've Got A Feeling', 'Dig A Pony', 'One After 909' and 'Don't Let Me Down' delivers grittier, sharper  more impressive songs. Personally though  I prefer the origianl version of Get Back with its warm up and finish. The accoustic tracks 'Two Of Us' and George's 'For You Blue' are also cleaner and crisper. The two grand piano presentations from Paul - 'Let It Be' and 'The Long and Winding Road' are literally stripped naked. 'The Long and Winding Road' dumps its strings and choirs, Pauls voice is boosted and the piano is much clearer. The result is a zillion times better than the original version. I would buy the album for this track alone. This version totally vindicates Paul McCartneys arguments about Phil Spector's production.<BR>I have mixed feelings over the 'Let It Be' track. The piano is clearer and the vocals, both lead and backing, are much more up front which is nice. On the other hand the hymnal quality of the orginal record with the overdubbed guitar solo and brass is lost. The tom tom frills on the original are also gone leaving just a basic drum track. Overall I prefer the majesty of the older version rather than the simplicity of this newer version.<BR>Ideally I'd love to have a copy featuring the pre-guitar solo section from 'Let It Be Naked' and the the guitar solo and post guitar solo section from the 'Let It Be' album.  The 'Naked' version of 'Across The Universe' has clearer guitar and better vocals. The removal of the orchestrations and background singing changes the song, the ethereal feel goes leaving a more simple yet still beautiful song. The addition of echo to John's voice at the end  of the song is a nice touch. I have to say I like both versions. George's 'I Me Mine' was only ever rehearsed in simple form during the 'Let It Be' project, it was finished much later. In that sense it is the least 'Let It Be' track of the album.  The original version featured  brass overdubs which filled out the song. These are now gone and are missed. Although the guitar is grittier on this version I have a slight preference for the original vesion. <BR>The addion of the Fly on The Wall CD is illuminating. It demonstrates that the Beatles were actually working together co-operatively on this project, the film for whatever reason gives the opposite impression. This CD also features snippets of songs and rehearsals some of which were not featured in the film. I'd love to hear more of them.<BR>'Let It Be Naked' is another first for the Beatles, nobody to my knowledge has ever revisited an album before. The revisitiation is justified as the album feels like an album. It feels more like and entity and is not disjointed like 'Let It Be' was  It is a very good album and an absolute must for Beatle fans but unfortuntely for reasons given above it is not the great album it could have been. If in doubt buy it for the simpler and more beautiful version of 'The Long and Winding Road'.  Before this, the best version of this song (featuring a brass section)was to be found on Paul's  'Give My Regards to Broad Street' album and film.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is a flat out modern rock smash that also happens to be a personal favorite, and an extreme high point in the creative affairs of Kiedis and co. I've never been a die hard Peppers fan; &quot;Bloodsugarsexmagic&quot; was never my thing, and funk-infused hybrid rap rates as a low point in my musical economy. BUT...this record is a spellbinding and flawless MASTERPIECE. &quot;Californication&quot; is a very good album, and it began as the neutral ground where the Chilli's began to meld their trademark style with a newer, more musically relaxed, melodic scope. And what a breath of fresh air this disc is! It is artistically compelling, poignant and endearing, as well as thought-provoking, haunting and beautiful. You can't go wrong with this record. I never thought I'd actually buy this album, but when I heard &quot;Dosed&quot; being played in a Sam Goodys, I knew that this record was an open invitation into a sublime peice of art. There are absolutly no filler tracks, no excessess, and no pointless excursions into funkadellic madness. This is REAL art with depth, and with sweeping sonics(thanks to Rick Rubin at the helm board) it cements the Peppers as artists of the greatest rank and range. Their trademark wry expressions of funk are apparent here, but only briefly(such as &quot;Can't Stop&quot; and &quot;Throw away your Television&quot;)and the remaining tracks sculp and mold a fine form cinergi of heart-wrenching ballads of genuine integrity. The opening track kicks things off the commercial way, which is good and dandy, but the tracks that follow are sensitive to emotion and never heavy-handed. &quot;Dosed&quot; is a beautiful and bittersweet ballad that is open to numerous interpretations(I think it's about heroin related deaths)and &quot;Tear&quot; is a marvel of beauty that mixes The Beatles and The Beach Boys into a passioante statement. I can't over-stuff this album with praise;it warrants it. Pick up this disc and go along for the ride. It's a wonderful record that outdistances ALL previous Chilli Pepper releases. This is the type of music that captivates the heart, mind and soul. An all around winner! Pick it up now, here at Amazon, and enjoy an album this good. One of the BEST defining rock records to come along and in my book,frankly, one of the best...EVER.<BR>Cheers!
B0000524E5|1.0|Yeah, let one of 'em spend a day with Ted Bundy... let's see how damn tough they act after such an experience. Stupid women.
B000000W6F|3.0|I don't mean to commit Pumpkins blasphemy, but I never really adored this album. For starters, it was too short and it featured a hybrid of loud physcadellic(can't spell that)turbo-charged rip-roaring rock, and somnolent tunes(like &quot;crush&quot;) that were too uneven and even, at times, slightly boring. I'm sorry Billy:( The Smashing Pumpkins are my all time favorite band and it's a bit of a shameful irony that I can't get into their first disc. The opening track is the best and rocks as hard and as mean as Hendrix or Led Zep. &quot;Siva&quot; is very good and sort of builds on the after-effects of &quot;I am One&quot;. &quot;Rhinocescorus&quot;(misspell, sorry)is a staggerringly good mini-epic that starts soft and rocks hard(SHE knows)and the next track &quot;Bury Me&quot; is tight and good. The only gripe, is that there are no real committments to intriguing and inviting depth or variety for the listener.(I'm so sorry Billy)...The last song, &quot;Daydream&quot;, is my favorite on the album, and although sung by D'arcy(the bass player), it still is Pumpkinesque and very bittersweet sad. I love it. All in all, I wouldn't start here for any virgin Pumpkin fans(not the label hounds, but the introductory listeners). Instead I'd go straight to &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinte Sadness&quot;(which has more appeal and commercial commodity/variety then &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;) and then right on over to &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;(their defining breakthrough and best record)...This is a good album.Very Very nicely polished, well written and produced, but Billy comes back and turns up the whole sound machine to 11(&quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, anyone?)with the next few groundbreaking releases. This record best compliments &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot;, me thinks, so buy the two together, here at Amazon, and you'll get a broader pallette to the great band that was and forever will be, &quot;The Smashing Pumpkins&quot;...<BR>(Lighters out)<BR>Yours truly,<BR>Luke
B00005JMFO|2.0|I really don't understand all these reviews with 5stars. I just came home from the cinema, and the movie really disseapointed me. There are far too many characters for you to care about. If they had cut the amount of stories in half, the movie might have been better. the only good reason for watching this movie are the good looking men!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|She croons like melted better and can hold her own like the best of them. This disc is a VERY welcome breath of fresh air that rates high in the pop-culture hierchy, mainly because it stylistically expounds on the breathtaking bliss of those great smoky voices that came before Norah, like Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. I highly reccomend this disc. It deserved every grammy that it won.
B0000CFW87|3.0|As always, Josh sings the song so beautifully. But, I am a bit disappointed with the song selections. The only good songs on this CD are &quot;Remember when it rained&quot; and &quot;Broken Vow.&quot; All the songs are too &quot;Deep&quot; and &quot;SAD&quot;. I would like to hear the same &quot;Tempo&quot; as it was on the first CD. This CD is like a &quot;Mideocre&quot; as compared to the first CD release.  Songs are a disappointment for a very talented artist like Josh Groban!!!...I would like to see a much better song selections hopefully, on the third CD!!!!!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|What becomes of a vastly talented band that can titillate and jar the political infastructure of socio-american ideals? Well, you'd get Rage against the Machine, that's what. Theys boys rock in a landmark way, complete with the hallmark innovative stylings of guitarist Tom Morrello and the monkey-on-my-back overstimulated physcotic ramblings of lead singer Zach Delerocha. Frankly, I think Zack is an ill-adjusted adolescent who is waging a losing battle that merits no idealistic worth or implicitly well purposed doctrine. Instead, we get a musically speaking, kick a$$ CD that rocks and revs up and rocks some more unlike most of their peers. Sadly, Zach is basically a closet case commie and a jaded braniac with a physcotic flair ruminating in his brain under his black curly locks. I don't respect commies. I don't respect Vietnam protesters either, especially when you see your best friend die in your arms, and your head seargent lose an arm; and then you come back to America, land of the brave, to get spit on and cursed at. This is tough stuff, so I think that the political agenda of Rage is misguided and self-destructive. American society is NOT the real enemy. Some of the lyrics featured on this disc mock Christ and support a convicted murderer(abdall jamal, whatever the guys name;he doesn't even merit my time here)so the sickest thing I can say about this disc is that it caters to the commies, to the rebels and to those who think little of a convicted murderer who shot a Philedelphian policeman in cold blood(free mumia, my a$$). So, why the 4 star review? Because the music rocks! It's tragic. It's alot like admiring Salvador Dali until he actually became quite insane and superseded his mad cackling eccentricities to the point of blunt lunacy. In closing, this disc is worth the 4 stars because of the strength of the songs and of the band, but here on a sidenote, I'll let it slip that the other members of Rage wanted out from a lead singer who was actually mulling over bombing a federal building.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|&gt;Across the Universe: Yep. Phil messed this one up too. John sounds like he's on quaaludes on the original &quot;Let it be&quot; version. However, the pristine and sparkling version on &quot;Anthology 2&quot; is wonderful. Or, you could check out the other version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; available on &quot;Past Masters, Vol. 2.&quot;<br />I don't actually remember the &quot;Anthology 2&quot; version (I don't own &quot;Anthology&quot; copies; I only checked them out from the library--curiosity only). I want to make a particular point here, though. Everything on the two &quot;Past Masters&quot; records was commercially released while the Beatles were still extant. To my mind, that makes them valid releases and for Beatles buffs essential. That means, in the case of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; it isn't just that a de-Spectorized version was already available; it is also that a de-Spectorized version has been available for three and one half decades; it is that YOU already have one in your record collection. (You also already own a very nice soulful version of &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; released first as a B side, then in the U.S. on the &quot;Hey Jude&quot; LP, and eventually on &quot;Past Masters, Vol. 2). <br />As for the Spectorized &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;: Hey, when you're in the mood it's GREAT. When you're not in the mood, you're probably not in the mood for any version of the song, especially not a version with gaping holes in it.
B000000W3G|5.0|In an ironic twist, this could very well be indicative of the Pumpkin's very best work; a hodge-podge over the top marvel of sonic experimentation with euphoric melodies to spare. No, seriously. This collection is high ranking among the very best, definitive work of the Smashing Pumpkins.Here is my close-cropped compilation to make it the true L.P. style masterpeice it was meant to be:<br />1. Set the ray to Jerry<BR>2. Transformer<BR>3. God<BR>4. Mouth of Babes<BR>5. Cherry<BR>6. Ugly<BR>7. Marquis in Spades<BR>8. Jupiter's Lament<BR>9. Medellia of the Grey Skies<BR>10. The Aeroplane Flies High(turns left, looks right)<BR>11. Rotten Apples<BR>12. Pennies<BR>13. The Last Song<br />By programming the discs like this into a tight fit unit, you can make another Smashing Pumpkins album! Go to it!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Although it is not really necessary to stick to the knitting of the script of Tolkein's book, what the extended version displays in dramatic form is how far from the environmental and anti-violence message Jackson's theatrical edition has strayed. Given the advance complaints from Christopher Lee about the hatcheting of the third film, it might just be best to wait until the extended DVD comes out next Christmas. We'll find out soon enough. A question for Jackson: why would you edit the third film anyway? There is no fourth. Do it right, for a change.<BR>As to this film, as with the first, much of the extra footage fills in details or gives more substance that in the theatre release seemed to be passing nods to cognoscenti who may have brushed up on the book just before curtain. However, there are some critical passages that SHOULD have been in: most notably, \\"Sons of the Steward\\" segment, the initial capture of Frodo & Sam by Faramir, and most importantly, \\"Flotsam and Jetsam.\\" In the case of the first, the essential dialectic between two sons of a father already unkowingly corrupted by the lure of the ring addresses everything from the literal implications to the endless psychological and family issues involved in the passing of one generation to another, be it business or early onset Alzheimers. But critically to the third film, this scene lays out what is a very key part of the conclusion of the story and why Middle Earth will be forever changed when it passes to men. <BR>As to Frodo's initial capture by Faramir, they come across a fallen opponent and Faramir delivers an oratory that is right at the heart of the tragedy of war, and this is a story borne of a tragedy in Europe in which young men answered calls and found their death. On top of the contextual part, the actuial acting in these two scenes is among the best in the series thus far. Pity. Do we really need more of the \\"Guns of Navaronne\\" type of film-making? Essentially all war movies are the same: stress in anticpation, catharsis in battle, sacrifice in the aftermath. What changes is the quality of the toys used to display it. That is NOT what the story is about.<BR>The Sons scene deleted also gives depth to Framir's confrontation with Frodo and Sam in the cave and establishes the ethical and the metaphysical reason why he, and not Boromir, should survive and have an important future in Middle Earth.<BR>Many of the other characters are given much more detail as well: Eowyn's part makes sense in this film now. She isn't just Renaissance eye-candy. The Ents are less Disney-like cartoons and actually manage to reel off both Tolkien's interest in lyrical poetry and the Heideggerian question concerning technology and the environment in more than broad pastiche.<BR>And that brings us to Flotsam: much has been made of Jackson's omission of the spider, which, honestly, is a mere dramatic device to advance the story (a more nefarious Tom Bombadill, if you will) that can be quickly addressed in #3. But at the fall of Isengaard, there is an essential confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman that defines the entire conflict that knowledge and power can produce among the knowing and the innocent. In the course of this confrontation, an orb is picked up that has enormous ontological consequences as the story unfolds. It ties in with the entire issue of knowledge, power, corruption and innocence. This is precisely how the movie should have ended, and more's the pity that Jackson took the Jerry Bruckheimer route.<BR>That said, and as the rumours begin to fly about the editing of RETURN OF THE KING, the third film is in danger of going Hollywood. I wept at the end of the books, and I suspect I'll just be full of popcorn with Jackson's resolution of the human factors, the exitential confrontations, the mythological interpretation of death and loss.<BR>This edition is truly what the second film should have been. If you love the story, pick this up.<BR>As to the superfluous material scattered over the other 2 discs, it's mostly for the Mac graphically inclined, but the discussion about Tolkien, featuring notably Christopher Lee, and the New Zealand as Middle Earth segments are terrific. Regarding Tolkien, the various talking heads give you an historical context, but unless you're literate enough to understand the dynamics between Tolkien and C.C. Lewis and even Charles Williams for that matter, this might be lost on the casual viewer. Still, I'm glad it's here. Tends to validate Lee's criticism's of Jackson's editing as well. It would be well to keep in mind that when published, it was ridiculed at Oxford as \\"Bored of the Rings\\" and actually never really achieved its legendary status until the hippies re-discovered it in the sixties. What began as an academic way of comforting his son in the midst of WW2 inspired so many of us later to be concerned about the very life-stuff of this planet, human and otherwise.
B000000W6R|4.0|For starters, the opening track &quot;Soothe&quot; always brings tears to my heart and eyes. When a sparse three minute song has the power to take command of your emotions at the beginning of any record, true props are to be given. But that's not all, folks.The Smashing Pumpkins are the most creative and talented artists to rise from the post grunge ashes of the early nineties. Bold opinion, you may say, but truth be told,in hindsight, I should have given &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;, 6 stars instead of 4. You see, even when Billy Corgan and Co. have overwhelmed their musical catelouge, the supposed b-sides are never delegated throw-aways, or second fiddle. They exceed expectations and in many cases, you'll hear fans screaming for &quot;Landslide&quot;(which Billy wryly refuses to play because of the overt and bellowing demand from one show)or &quot;Starla&quot; or &quot;La Dolly Vita&quot;(the album's tightest track). What can I say? I'd eat peaches every day...lol. No, dear reader, even if you arn't an avid S.P. fan, you can still find plenty of ballsy power-rock numbers, whispery ballads, aching acoustic numbers, rip-roaring covers, and spaced out 7 minute mammoth jams! I give you a personalized rating of the top 10 best in this 14 track collection:<BR>1. Starla(this OBVIOUSLY should have been on &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;)<BR>2. Pissant(this tight rock no. was, but only in the Japanese import L.P.)<BR>3. La Dolly Vita(sadly, I am not a &quot;Gish&quot; fan, and this inclusion might have made me a little happier with it)<BR>4. Whir(beautiful, beautiful song. Sounds like gentle folk. Catch the ending, as the guitars fade out into minor key showmanship)<BR>5. Blew Away(Jame's Iha's BEST S.P. era song. This was certainly good enough to be put on &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, but no matter, it's here and it elevates the artistry status of the whole album. A beautiful power-rock balld of love. AWESOME!!!)<BR>   So my friends, there it is. AND there are 10 more, none of which suck(although &quot;Spaced&quot; is sort of like a hazy acid trip)<BR>My only gripe is that &quot;Slunk&quot;, &quot;Pulzcar&quot;, &quot;Drown&quot; and &quot;Apathy's last Kiss&quot; were ommitted. These songs are not on any officail L.P.'s, only on a soundtrack, video, and single. Still, buy this record after you have bought their best(&quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; and &quot;Adore&quot;)and then you can get into the truly happening vibe that is their MAMMOTH b-side collection, &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High&quot;.(Personally, there's more hard rock numbers and variety that show a marked maturity in style and musical execution since this record). In closing, buy this album and rock out to it, sing to it, share it, cry to it, laugh to it and ...press repeat over and over again. And, Kids: stay off the drugs...music like this will remind you that are beautiful alternatives to dope. <BR>Cheers, y-all!
B00005JM02|5.0|2003s best. One of the best movies I've seen in a while! truely amazing. I didn't think it'd be this good. But then again what can I expect from Disney n' Pixar? the animation was incredible and the voice overalls did great. Dory in my opinion was the most entertaining character in the movie. All the fish had great their own unique greatness.<br />The DVD features are excellent. I only have the FS version of the film because I split the DVD with my sister (neice and nephew). I ususally go for the WS but in this case FS is better because it doesn't cut anything out. In my high school this movie is well known for a Disney movie. I think that's saying something.<br />I want a huge fish tank now with all the fish in this movie including the Blue \\"yes I'm a natural blue\\" Tang.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I'll make this short. Quite simply, this DVD is absolutely breathtaking. I bought the Coldplay DVD last week, and it pales in comparison to this one. Slane boasts incredible effects (like a 360 degree circling view of Anthony while in midair), great camera angles, fades between the crowd and closeups of the guys, and other amazing things. The setlist for this show is incredible, the highlights being Under the Bridge and Venice Queen. This was the biggest crowd the Peppers ever played for (80,000) people, and there is nothing quite like seeing everyone chanting together with only Chad banging on his drums. In short, I assure you that you will get chills down your spine when you watch this. If you liked Coldplay's Live 2003, then you will like this even more! Enjoy.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think &quot;In The Zone&quot; shows Britney's biggest and best growth. &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot; and especially &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot; are the standout tracks. &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; is ok but certainly not the most memorable track on &quot;In the Zone&quot;. I think &quot;In The Zone&quot; is way better than Christina Aguilera's &quot;Stripped&quot; and Madonna's &quot;American Life&quot;. I like how this cd is so upbeat. Overall this is a great cd and definetly worth the money. This is for any Britney fan or anyone remotely interested in her!!!
B0000T6JH4|1.0|Don't get me wrong.  I LOVE the Beatles . . . but there is nothing all that revelatory on &quot;Naked&quot;.  Phil Spector added additional instrumentation to just four songs on the original album. And stripped down versions ALREADY exist on Anthology 2 and 3 and other releases, some, in fact, even prior to the release of the original LIB album. (Regarding Spector's production: he went too far on John's ATU and George's IMM, but his work on Paul's LWR and LIB was actually not bad at all.)  Aside from that, the &quot;Naked&quot; title is ATROCIOUS and extremely inappropriate in the context of the sober sentiment of the title track.  The cover art is vapid.  But the worst part is removing John Lennon material from a Beatles album. (&quot;Naked&quot; sounds sterile and it loses the orginal's fun loving character without the Monty Python-esque intro bits.  And Lennon's &quot;Thank you on behalf of the group . . . &quot; comment has been removed!) Paul also removed &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;. That is a very classless act on his part. Those songs aren't musical masterpieces. Fine. But it would have been VERY classy of him to have taken the high road and have put LONGER versions of them on the album.  For the love of heaven, I want MORE Beatles material, not LESS!  How would Paul like &quot;Abbey Road&quot; re-released without &quot;Her Majesty&quot;?  The Fly on the Wall disc does provide some &quot;new&quot; musical bits, but mixed in with chatter and discussion. You're not going to listen to it more than once.  If you're into bootlegs, then you know there is a tremendous amount of Let it Be material that could be used, with some editing, to scrape together a few &quot;new&quot; Beatles songs. No masterpieces for sure, but that would still be of more interest to this fan than Paul's self-aggrandizing &quot;Naked&quot; rehash.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was blown away by this CD. I was expecting the same old crap from Britney Spears but she went beyond my expectations. The party starts with \\"Me Against the Music\\" feat. none other than my generations icon, Madonna, and just picks up steam from there. \\"Boom Boom\\" is Brit's first true credible hip-hop collaboration not withstanding \\"Slave\\" w/ The Neptunes and \\"Showdown\\" is pure dance-pop. Then, my fave song, \\"Breathe on Me\\", turns everything around w/ her first club anthem..seriously I cannot wait for the DJ to play that song! \\"Early Mornin\\" keeps the electronica vibe going w/ none other than Moby producing her and her voice has never been sexier, a laid-back track that's smokin. \\"Toxic\\", a song I haven't been able to get out of my head ( but in a good way) is pop in its purest form and sure to be a hit for Miss Brit. \\"Outrageous\\", another hip-hop track w/ R. Kelly continues the party leading to \\"Touch of My Hand\\". Her sexiest song yet has this undeniably irresistable eastern feel to it but is still very listenable. As if she hasn't explored every genre at this point, Britney tries some reggae w/ \\"The Hook-up\\" and succeeds immeasureably. \\"Shadow\\", her first ballad on Zone, slows down the groove and we get to here Brit's chops ( and she can sing) despite what people will say. \\"Brave New Girl\\" is such a fun track and she resembles Gwen Stefani. This collection ends w/ the introspective \\"Everytime\\" which she wrote and is about her break-up w/ Justin timberlake and if U haven't heard this song, when U do U will know that Britney Spears is an artist not just a performer. Overall, this CD is her best yet and I can't wait to see where she goes next 'cause whether U like her or not, she ain't going anywhere people. Britney is here to stay!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I Bought this Set mainly for the R.Kelly Written&Produced Track \\"Outrageous\\" which is tight.the Ying Yang twins bring it as well.\\"Me against the World\\" with Madonna works better for Madonna in a duet form than if She did this track Solo.if Britney could only Sing this would be a better than Avergae set.but Her voice hurts my ears.but in Her defense there has always been suspect vocalists of all eras.this is Probably the best Album She has done yet overall.She is a trip when you listen to the Lyrical content here.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is my favorite cd I own. It is so amazing. If you like Radiohead, you'll like the Mars Volta. The music sets an amazing mood whenever you listen to it. Every song is a work of art and I would recommend this strongly to anyone.
B0000E1WKE|3.0|Whitney Houston is One of the Baddest Vocalists that I Ever heard but She hasn't had Albums to Compliment Her Gift aside from her Debut Album.this Album trys to cover the patchy elements of Her Last Album&it easily does that off the bat.She can't quite match Her vocals on \\"the Preachers Wife\\" here but She has moments.I still say that Whitney like Mariah having to share the same writer&Producers as the 3rd-5th Tier Acts on these Labels has cost them dearly as Artist.take that new Alicia Keys cut \\"You don't Know\\": let someone like Whitney get that cut in Her full Natural VOice&that Song would Move you.Whitney Settled for Middle of the Road for the most part long ago&has been stuck there for a good minute now.this Set has Moments here&there but I still say we just never Get Her un-cut like I hope&wished for.the same goes for Mariah Carey.
B0000A36J5|5.0|As with Fellowship, I really think this extended addition to Two Towers is a great improvement.  I enjoyed the theatrical version immesely, but this release is that much better.  In particular, the changes to Faramir's character makes much more sense now with the addition of the Osgiliath scenes.  While I was initially very bothered by the alteration in his character, now I actually approve.  He is the same Faramir that Tolkien wrote with more of a dramatic twist.  He is tempted by the ring, but never, unlike Boromir, tries to take it from Frodo.  He has to see what the ring does to Frodo before he can really understand its danger and let it go.  There is also a lot more Gandalf in this version, more Treebeard, and a bit of an extended ending which adds elements from the book.  Overall, I think the additions bring the movie closer to Tolkien's original vision of the story.  In one of the documentaries, someone argues that a lot of Lord of the Rings is about fighting despair.  I think whoever said that really captured the essence of the book and the film.  For all the changes that had to be made, this movie still captures the spirit of of Tolkien's writing.<br />The extras are really something as well.  The docmentaries on Tolkien, the script, editing, and filming are all excellent, but the highlight has to be the documentary on Gollum and Andy Serkis.  The Gollum figure that comes with this set is very well done (if you can get it out of the box!), but the fifth disk on the creation of the statue(s) is really sort of a let down (less than a half hour long).  It felt like an extended sales pitch for Sideshow-Weta.  If you get this set, you are really getting it for the Gollum figure.
B000063DFQ|4.0|many Maiden fans consder this disc a classic and yes,there are classics in this album,in my opinion 4 classics:Where eagles dare,Revelations,The troopper and To tame a land and a semi classic:flight of icarus(sounds a bit too comercial for my taste)the rest cannot be compared to the classics not even the semi classic =),they are good rock songs but the kind any average rock band is capable of,not bad but not amazing:NOT MAIDEN!!!!!Why the four stars then?!? One stars for each classic,priceless songs,I should put four and a half,remember the semi classic?don't konw how the hell you do that!
B00006SFLV|5.0|I never watched this show when it was on ABC.  I happened to catch it on MTV one night and thought it was one of their productions.  I fell instantly in love with the characters!  When I saw the final episode, I thought it was a joke...I couldn't beleive you could just be left hanging like that.  I firmly beleive that this was (and still is) one of the best high school / life orientated shows ever produced.  The characters and situations were so true to life and honest...it is obvious that the show was far ahead of it's time.  <br />I was over joyed to discover that the entire series was available on DVD.  I just finished watching it (I only got it 2 days ago!) and once again felt as if I had discovered a missing piece of my heart.  I really think that even now, 9 years later, this is an amazing program that should be shared with parents and kids.
0385504209|5.0|I am a big mystery lover. I love the kind of book where one thing leads to another, and you never know what the next twist is going to be. If you like that kind of book, you'll LOVE this one. Also, i am VERY MUCH NOT a history buff, but there was just something about the history of the paintings and such in this book, that i was captivated. It normally takes me 2 weeks to finish a book, but i finished this one in 2 days! i would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys mystery, history, or just a good adventure. This is a ride you won't forget anytime soon. Enjoy!!!!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I have loved the Strokes since the day I saw their video for Last Night on MTV2. This much awaited follow up to thier first record is well worth the money. I have seen them on tour twice in support of this record and can only say that the music sounds way better live... then again it almost always does when dealing with a great band like the Strokes!
B00006RAKP|5.0|I was one of those teenagers who grew up on New Wave and Metal.  To me, Elton John was a Top 40 artist made famous by hits like \\"I'm Still Standing\\" and \\"Sad Songs (say so much)\\".  I didn't know much about his earlier works and, like so many of my generation, heaped scorn upon anything that smacked of the `70s.<br />Well, fast forward to 2003 and I'd lost touch with Elton for more than 10 years. I popped Disc 2 into the player and listened to the hit tracks from my youth first.   Sure, I could recognize his singles from a few Disney movies; but other than that, about two thirds of the tracks on Elton John: Greatest Hits 1970 - 2002 sounded only vaguely familiar.  Shame on me!  After listening to the rest of the album, reading the liner notes and talking to other music fans I have found a true appreciation of this artist who managed to create memorable hits spanning three decades - without becoming a trend clone like so many other long-lived pop stars.  Elton sings insightfully about universal ups and downs, in life and in love.  His music is heavy on the piano, had hints of big band style a times, synthesizer at others, but was always recognizable as rock'n'roll.  Perhaps it takes time for the real artists to show up against the backdrop of forgettable stylings; but EJ stayed a class act all around and deserved every bit of his commercial successes and more.<br />Most of what I know now about EJ's remarkable career came from the pull-out booklet tucked inside the 2 disc album.  Paul Gambaccini wrote an interesting mini biography on Elton and his writer, Bernie Taupin.  Apparently a lot of credit for EJ's consistency over the years goes to Bernie's talent for writing lyrics that reflect the inner workings of his personal life.  The two are a magical combination of geniuses, the results of which are many much-loved ballads and anthems.  It was a pleasure to look over the selection of photos from each decade and the gallery of album covers.  I made a mental note to puta few of them in my shopping cart later.<br />Of course 34 songs can't definitively represent the body of work that Elton and Bernie have produced for a total of 41 albums.  I can only wonder at the overblown expectations that some true fans must have had prior to the release of this album; realize, fellow music lovers, that this offering of greatest hits was never meant to appeal to those knowledgeable disciples of EJ, but to be a short survey for the ignorant such as myself.  It worked!  I have been successfully lured into finding more music by this sensational artist.  If some of the tracks have been slightly altered (i.e. fade outs at the end of some tracks), I wouldn't know to be disappointed, but I will find out later when I hear the originals.  If better selections are missing here, I will discover them on my personal musical journey.  In this way, many converts are won to good music.<br />This is a collection well worth its price to music fans like me who so badly need to expand their musical horizons.  Go ahead - you will enjoy yourself.  You may even learn a thing or two.<BR>-Andrea, aka Merribelle
B00008OWZC|5.0|Led Zeppelin has not been served well by \\"official\\" live recordings to date (\\"The Song Remains the Same\\" soundtrack, anyone?), but that has been corrected, for once and for all by this massive 3CD (18 tracks, 149 min.) recording of their 1972 concerts in LA and Long Beach.<br />CD1 (10 tracks; 56 min.) is the most diversified of the set, with the band romping through a variety of classics, including a great \\"Immigrant Song\\", an electrifying (literally) \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Black Dog\\" (which even live sounds terrific without the multiple overdubs of the studio version). \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is not my fave Zep tune, but sounds great here. \\"Going to California\\" is gorgeous. CD2 (4 tracks, 53 min.) is centered around \\"Dazed and Confused\\", sounding better than ever in all of its 25 min., and John Bohnam's 19 min. drum solo. CD3 (4 tracks, 40 min.) is the lesser of the set, but contains a great \\"The Ocean\\".<br />In all, this is a monumental and indispensable release, not just for the die-hard Zep fans, but for anyone casually intersted in Zep. To call this \\"Greatest Hits Live\\" is doing Zep an unjustice as the band was never about \\"hits\\" but in the end, this is what this album really sounds like.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Phil Conors ( Bill Murray) is a TV weatherman that is rude, conceited, and full of himself. Every year he gets stuck having to go to Punxsutawney, Pensylvania to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. Going with him this year is his sexy and cheerful producer Rita ( Andie McDowell), and his smart-mouthed, yet somewhat nerdy camera man Larry ( Chris Elliot). Phil wants to get out of town as soon as possible, but is snowed in when an unexpected blizzard hits. But things are about to get even worse. Phil wakes up the next morning to discover that it's Groundhog Day all over again. He is forced to live the same day over and over. But the more Phil is forced to repeat it, the more he comes to care about the town and those around him. But life really starts to get complicated when he finds himself falling for Rita. <br />\\"Groundhog Day\\" is one of the funniest and most original films ever made. Bill Murray has made a lot of outstanding films. But in my opinion, \\"Groundhog Day\\" is his best one. The repeating day is amazingly done. All of the actors do an extremely good job making each day look the same. The laughs that this film brings are non-stop. I even found myself rewinding scenes for a second and third viewing at times. Bill Murray is amazing as Phil Connors. Watching him play both roles is great. The first being the one who hates everybody and only cares about himself. Watching him try to kill himself over and over will make you laugh extremely hard. The other is the one that adjusts to live in Punksatawney and learns to care about those around him. No matter what he does, he will make you laugh. Andie McDowell is great as Rita. Her sweet and caring nature works well against Murray's negative attitude. The chemistry between her and Murray is amazing. One of the best romance stories I have ever seen. However, my favorite character was Stephen Tobolowsky's Ned Rierson. Every different time Ned and Phil meet, provides for the funniest scenes in the film. \\"Ned, I'd love tostay here and talk with you. But I'm not going to.\\" Chris Elliot and the rest of the town are also all outstanding. <br />No matter how many times you see this film, you will never find it boring, repetitive, or less funny. In fact, you laugh harder with each viewing. The story, romance between Phil and Rita, and the great all around acting make Groundhog Day one of the best comedies ever made. The DVD is great, and the documentary : \\"The Weight of Time\\", is worth the price alone
B0000DD7LB|5.0|\\"In the zone\\" is a great cd!It is different from the other three albums cause the songs are more sexy,r'n'b and the voice of brit is improved.In songs like showdown,touch of my hand she sounds like Kylie Minogue or Madonna!!My favourite songs are:me against the music(the remix)boom boom,showdown,toxic,hook up,shadow,everytime.The last two are the two ballads of the album and everyone would agree that they refer to Justin Timberlake.The songs of the album make u wanna dance...ok,Brit did a great job but i have to say tha t i am a little disapointed with the image she shows.Go and get this cd NOW!i think the next cd-singles will be:boom boom,toxic,everytime...
B000068TPN|5.0|&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; manages to show the brotherhood between soldiers, the horror of war, and the commaraderie between the soldier's wives. The film is set in 1965, when America was at war with Vietnam. The commander of the air calvary is Lt. Col. Hal Moore ( Mel Gibson). Moore is a natural born leader and treats all of his soldiers like they were his own family. He is assigned to take his troops into hostile territory, to gain the upper hand. However, things do not go as planned, and the casualties start to mount. Back at home, Moore's wife Julia (Madeline Stowe) takes on the responsibility of keeping morale high for the soldiers' wives and handing out the death letters that are sent. The film is shot brilliantly and takes us back and forth between the two, to let us truly experience what happened. <br />&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is one of the best war films that I have seen in quite some time. The film is based on Lt. Col. Hal Moore's book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once.. and Young&quot;. This provides for an amazingly accurate portrayal of the events that took place. The battle sequences are among the best that I have ever seen, and the camera work used was phenomenal(especially in the air). The musical score used was beautiful and one of the best that I have ever heard. But perhaps the best aspect of this film, was that it showed that there was more than one side to the war. Most war films only show American soldiers fighting and trying to win the war. This was the first war film, that took an in depth look at the Colonel of the Vietnamese army, and how he strategized. That was my favorite aspect of the film, because it put Colonel against Colonel. But it did not just show each sides strategies. The film also shows what both sides went through as well. We see that Vietnam was a country fighting to defend itself just like us, and like us, they also suffered. This gives the film a more well rounded feel to it. <br />&quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; offers tonsof star power as well. Mel Gibson shows once again why he is one of the best actors alive today. His portrayal of Lt. Col. Hal Moore is sensational. He gives an extremely accurate portrayal of the man, with his overall intelligence, his courage under fire, and his unending loyalty towards his troops. &quot;I will leave no man behind...dead or alive. We will all come home together.&quot; Definately one of Gibson's best roles since Braveheart. Madeline Stowe is outstanding as Moore's wife Julie. The way that she keeps morale high with the soldier's wives is amazing. Very convincing role. Sam Elliot is very good as Sergeant Major Basil Plumley. Plumley is Gibson's right hand man, and never leaves his side. He is also very tough, and corageous under fire. Other fine performances were given by Greg Kinnear, Chris Kline, Keri Russel, and Barry Pepper. <br />Overall, this is one of the best all around war films that I have ever seen. The film is extremely realistic, takes an in depth look at both sides of the war, and has outstanding acting all the way around. The DVD is outstanding. It offers extremely nice picture and sound quality, that only makes watching the film even better. The extras are incredible. You get 10 deleted scenes, a behind the scenes featurette, and commentary by director Randall Wallace. You will not be dissapointed with this film, and I consider it a must own.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Whitney still has &quot;the voice&quot; that made her famous.  Personally, I think her last album &quot;Just... Whitney&quot; did not get the credit it deserved, just like this album will probably not get the credit it deserves either.  &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas&quot; and &quot;The First Noel&quot; are my favorite tracks.  I have to admit I think Whitney has either lost her higher register or just decided not to use it that much on this album, either way it is a shame and why I gave the album 4 instead of 5 stars.  Mariah Carey's X-Mas album is still the best out there, but Whitney's runs a close second.  &quot;One Wish&quot; is definitly an album not to be missed!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Don't rely on the low fidelity samples here to give you a taste of what this album really sounds like. Buy it. Listen to it through good headphones, and I don't mean $2.00 earbuds.  It's nearly a religious experience. With all of Phil Spectors garbage stripped away (let's face it, if you're a Beatles fan, you already own the original Apple release, and if you're old enough, you bought it on vinyl 33 years ago anyway and know it note for note).. there is an intimacy and an immediacy to this new version that words simply can't describe. John's vocals on Dig A Pony and George's on I Me Mine are capable of invoking tears of joy. I noted some tape hiss on this new version, but I expected it. High quality headphones reveal everything.<br />This isn't The Beatles' best album. Not by far. We can argue all day about which one is. My vote would be Sgt. Pepper's. I was never crazy about Let It Be.. it was tragic knowing what was going on with The Beatles as they recorded it. But here it is, stripped down to its basics. The layers of Spector's crap removed to reveal four guys (with Billy Preston) who were simply masters of their art. Again, give it a listen on a good system with good headphones and if it doesn't send chills down your spine, there's something wrong with you.
0385509456|5.0|This novel is incredible. The fact that the narrator is an autistic teenager intrigued me into giving this book a whirl. Christopher Boone is out walking in the middle of the night when he discovers that a dog on his street has been murdered with a pitchfork. Despite his father's warnings to mind his own business, Christopher is determined to solve the mystery and is equally determined to write it all down. His writings become quite a compelling serial. The novel isn't about the dog per se -- it's about Christopher and his dynamics. I confess that I don't know much about autism, but Christopher's voice is beautiful and compelling. He is quite a memorable character. Haddon's unique mystery is one that shall be passed along to all of my friends. Highly recommended...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|As someone who never really liked Britney Spears, when a friend of mine played her new CD for me, I was intrigued. I went out and bought In the Zone and I must say, it's just plain good music. I love the entire vibe of this CD and Spears' choice of several different but equally wonderful producers makes this album stand above many others. As someone who couldn't stand the girl, I can now say that I am a fan and I will be looking forward to future projects from her. She has really grown and this record shows that.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Simply amazing. Let It Be . . . Naked is quite possibly one of the best beatles albums ever. Much controversy has raged over this tampering with history, but that is not the case with LIBN. This is qhat the album was supposed to be, before it was \\"Spectorized.\\" This is what the Beatles meant for the public to hear, not Phil Spector's \\"Wall of Sound.\\" To the untrained ear, this album sounds a lot like Let It Be. In fact, one almost has to be a Beatles aficionado to appreciate the album. Many songs do sound similar, with the major exceptions of The Long and Winding Road and One After 909. These songs are completely different from the originals. The Long and Winding Road has all of the distracting and disgusting orchestration taken away, and One After 909 is almost a brand new song. One After 909 is the perfect example of why this album was rereleased. One After 909 was written early in the Beatles' career by John Lennon, back in the days of skiffle and early rock and roll, a fifties throw back if you will. But on Let It Be, it didn't quite sound like a throw back. On Let It Be...Naked, it sounds like an old recording actually from the fifties thrown on the album. Absolutely fantastic.  If you are a true Beatles fan, buy this album. If you are sick of the \\"music\\" of today, buy this album. Let It Be . . . Naked is music. LIBN is the essence, the soul, the heart of what music is supposed to be...

B00005JLYW|4.0|I must say that this sequel to the original in my opinion was really awesome with the exception that when I saw it at the theater, it didnt look as fake as it did on the DVD version. Otherwise the only other problem I have with this film is that at certain points in the story, it gets confusing. Demi Moore's character was cool and the new Bosley was way better than Bill Murray's version of Bosley. Bernie Mac was funnier while Bill Murray was too serious. All in all I thought the movie was great and hopefully they will make a Charlie's Angels 3!
B00005JM02|5.0|&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is one of the best animated movies released in 2003.  This movie is highly enjoyable for audiences of all ages, not just kids.  It has many unique features that stand out from all other movies, especially the combination of comedy and life-long lessons.  Its plot will keep audiences laughing at many quotes.  Every movie characteristic is catchy.  Every scene keeps the audience awaiting anxiously for the next scene.  Marvin's journey to rescue his son from humans and Nemo's struggle to escape from the aquarium symbolize this.<br />The acting is great.  Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney, and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush are a few actors who offer their voices.  Degeneres amazingly offers her own sense of humor to the movie.  All other actors also played their roles wonderfully.  Every voice effect matches their characters' profile perfectly.<br />The catchiness stretches further than just the screenplay.  The animation is ahead of its time.  The color is amazingly shiny.  It matches the ocean's glow perfectly and keeps the ocean beautiful as it is in real life.  Every detail is perfect, even the minor ones.  If watched closely the whole time, the audience will notice that the artists did not cheat a single scene, like many others do.<br />It wouldn't be surprising if &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; received an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature for 2003.  Compared to all other animated films released this year, this movie could likely win.  Those who watch this movie will discover why it became the highest grossing animated movie of all time.  Many will be highly entertained.<br />***Note: Once the end credits begin, don't push &quot;stop&quot; immediately.  There's one more scene.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|I used to be one of the greatest fan of Whitney Houston, I didn't mind if her songs were not always beautiful 'cause she had THE VOICE, an incredible, amazing sound, but I'd be really stupid and disrespectful of her &quot;old&quot; talent if wouldn't say that she has lost something. She still knows how to &quot;move&quot; her voice but it sounds really different, it's so powerless and it makes me sad as a fan and mostly as a listener. You can realize what I'm saying listening to &quot;Joy to the world&quot; and &quot;Who would imagine a king&quot; that she has recorded years ago for the soundtrack of her movie &quot;The preacher's wife&quot;, and where her voice is at her best. After those two songs go back to the others and you will surely note that she is not the same. &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; is my favorite tracks, where Whitney's child sings (adorable), but one song cannot make an intere album...sad but true.
B00005JLEU|5.0|&quot;Spirited Away&quot; is one of the best japanese animated movie released.  It rightfully won the Oscar for Best Animated Film for 2002.  The plot was written very creatively.  It combines adventure, drama, and fantasy, offering the audience a unique theme that no one will forget.  This begins when the family car stalls, and the little girl walks into a maze of unknown fantasy.  She must escape this dangerous territory before it's too late.  If she fails, her parents and her sanity will have disasterous results.  Her struggles through her mission offer many twists and turns, keeping the audience's eyes wide open.  The acting is wonderful, whether speaking english or japanese.  The animation is amazing.  The combination of elaborate colors and features give the movie the added viewing pleasure.  Such quality keeps &quot;Spirited Away&quot; ahead of its time.  This movie answers why it's the highest grossing japanese movie of all time.  This will keep its audiences entertained during and after viewing.  This will be a classic in the near following years.
B00005YW4H|2.0|. . . and I can understand why. Norah Jones has a beautful voice,  she works with great musicians like Bill Frisell, and each song is carefully crafted to sound perfect and not offend anyone. When I hear this album, I get bored. Norah Jones sings over one slow and classy song after another and I nod off, waiting patiently for something to happen. Thanks to the success of this CD, maybe she'll branch out on the next one. Maybe she'll try something less predictable.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I have been a hard core time metallica fan for years. At first, i was bit skeptical, but i read a few reviews and figured what the heck. this dvd is amazing with the exception of minor details. someone metioned it and yes, its true: if metallica didnt sit on their ass and moan about it the whole time and let mike kamen do all the work, it would have been a better show. Still, it gets, and deserves 5 stars. I suggest you buy this DVD, you wont be dissppointed. tons of good songs, not many bad ones, 1 or 2 i didnt practiculary like, only because they didnt really need that &quot;orchestral touch.&quot; still overalll, a great performance, pick it up because this was probably the last good tour before they send out that f$#king st. anger tour which will suck ASS ON ICE.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This extended cut is even better than the theatrical release. The extra 45 minutes are well-spent. The additions come in two forms: (1) small shots added into previously-seen scenes, and (2) entirely new scenes, inserted into the story sequence. The new scenes include a flashback from Faramir, showing his conversations with Boromir. It's nice to see Sean Bean back on screen, reprising his role from The Fellowship of the Ring. Another new scene shows the aftermath of the Ent assault on Isengard.<br />The added shots are all good. Gollum gets a little extra screen time doing things like trying to eat Lambas bread, gagging on it, and then snatching a fresh worm from the swamp and sucking it down like spaghetti. It's just 20 seconds long, but it adds much more to the overall story.<br />The four audio tracks and two DVDs of documentary are exhausting and fantastic. As in the extended Fellowship set, the whole crew goes through every stage of filmmaking, from design drawings to editing and mixing the sound. Actors tell their anecdotes for each major scene, Peter Jackson explains nearly every shot of the film, and you get to see how each special effects shot was built and then integrated into the final picture. There are also a few teasers about scenes that were shot and left out, and ideas that were cut before being filmed for various reasons.<br />This movie was a real labor of love for a huge number of talented artists. It shows in this set of DVDs. Few films are this good, and even fewer are given this kind of complete, detailed, entertaining treatment for fans who can't get enough.
B00003CXE6|4.0|This epic movie begins with Russell Crowe as General Maximus leading a battle, against the barbarians, into Germania -- the last stronghold standing in the way of Roman victory and the promise of peace throughout the Roman Empire.  The whole riveting battle is watched by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, played by Richard Harris.  The Emperor, who knows that he is dying, and does not want his powers to pass on to his son, Commodus, asks Maximus to take his place as Emperor.  Upon learning of his father's decision, Commodus kills his father and takes over the throne as Emperor of Rome.  When Maximus refuses to acknowledge Commodus as Emperor, Commodus has Maximus' wife and son killed and orders Maximus to be executed.  Maximus manages to escape and returns home, only to find his family dead.  Weak and exhausted from his wounds, Maximus is captured by slave traders and sold to a former gladiator, Proximo.  Maximus becomes a gladiator in Prosimo's gladiator school and ends up back in Rome to fulfill his vegeneance against the Emperor Commodus.<br />The movie, filled with political intrigue, is extremely emotional and filled with action.  The audience is left feeling that they are a part of that time period and are as one with the Roman peoples as they watch the battle of the gladiators as Maximus fights the Emperor Commodus in a battle to the death.<br />Russell Crowe was exceptional in his portrayal of Maximus, as was Joanquin Phoenix in his portrayal of Commodus.  You loved Maximus -- you hated Commodus.<br />&quot;The Gladiator&quot; would appeal to some, but not to others.  I find myself in the middle, but am not sure why.  There was a lot of &quot;blood and guts,&quot; but I think the emotional impact is what has left me undecided; the same feeling I have come away with after watching &quot;The Patriot,&quot; with Mel Gibson, and &quot;Windwalker,&quot; with Nicolas Cage.  Maybe it is because these movies are harsh realities of life we have to face -- realities we really don't want to face -- realities we know that we will always have to face.  <br />Ridley Scott did an infamous job in directing the film.  The acting was superb, the scenery glorius and overwhelming.  &quot;The Gladiator&quot; is a movie I would recommend -- and let you decide.
B0000028UK|4.0|This is Pearl Jam's best album. There isn't a bad track on it. Every song is either a noisy rocker (Blood, Go, Leash), a passionate ballad (Elderly Woman, Daughter), or something fun and a little weird (Rats, WMA). It includes Rearviewmirror, which is probably the ultimate Pearl Jam song --- Eddie Vedder sings like a wounded animal, the band is locked together in the same groove, and the music just builds and builds until it almost breaks. If you don't own any albums by Pearl Jam, buy this one anyway.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|yes, Britney is blonde and hot.  yes, she had this justin timberlake thing. (?) this release I find obviously influenced by Madonna's &quot;Erotica&quot;.  That is how this release suffers; there are some great tracks - &quot;Showdown&quot;, Brave New Girl&quot; and the lovely &quot;Everytime&quot;.  There are also some also awful choices for such an important release you have to wonder who is smoking what. However - the track TOXIC - has the best groove on &quot;record&quot; since I don't know - that Rick James song that smithy ripped off.  It is worth the price of the entire CD.  Also - you can hear &quot;her voice&quot; - which is not as bad as the critics like to dismiss.  Big problem - the back photo looks too much like Debbie Gibson and we all know where she is (or isn't).  Keep it up Britney - and do a duet with Cher - someone who can sing - that'll keep your chops bitin'!
B00005JMFI|4.0|Oh what a fun movie for all ages. My mother (70 something) and I (40 something) saw it and laughed throughout the feature. Just the two of us...no kids...<BR>The story is adorable. <BR>This movie reminded me of two very different films: Miracle on 34th Street and Splash. Its emphasis on the purity of Christmas, on believing in Santa, on the excitement of Christmas in a NY department store recall Miracle on 34th street. Buddy's innocent travails through the New York landscape (e.g., waving to a man who is hailing a cab) are reminiscent of Splash. <BR>But the movie also has its own unique charm. Ferrell's performance is a delight. He conveys Buddy's sweetness without any saccharine. Zooey Deschanel as the Gimbel's elf is a revealation. She has  a beautiful singing voice and a sly, tart acting style. <BR>I recommend this movie for individuals of all ages who enjoy broad, commercial comedies-with a Christmas twist.
B00005JMF6|2.0|After having just seen \\"Gothika\\" my first reactions is HUH? Why did Halle Berry, Robert Downey and Penelope Cruz do this film? What did Director Mathieu Kassovitz (Amelie's main squeeze) see in this material that does not in any way manifest itself in the finished product?<br />\\"Gothika\\" is an unwitting throwback to the perhaps yes/perhaps no intentionally funny William Castle movies of the 50's and 60's: films like \\"The Creeper\\" and \\"The Tingler\\" (Castle supposedly had vibrating devices installed under all the theater seats!!). Unfortunately, this movie is in no way out for the laughs it inevitably gets; which is pretty sad in that there is so much good material floating around that begs to be filmed and yet this poor excuse for a film is foisted on us, probably because of Berry's marquee value.<br />I would think that Gothika will slink into that netherworld of the Midnight Movie with audience members dressing in insane asylum drag and shouting back the dialogue at the fading images of Berry, Cruz and Downey as they vainly try to pump some life into this still born mess of a movie.
B0000DJE9R|3.0|Michael Jackson's sanity is clearly a matter of debate, but only a fool would deny his talent and chart supremacy since leaving Motown.  &quot;Number Ones&quot; is yet another collection featuring the usual lineup of his classic hits: &quot;Billie Jean,&quot; &quot;Don't Stop Til You Get Enough,&quot; &quot;Beat It,&quot; &quot;Rock With You,&quot; and so on.  The tracklisting is presented in chronological order, starting with material from &quot;Off the Wall,&quot; right up to the previously unreleased R. Kelly ballad &quot;One More Chance&quot; and a somewhat unnecessary live performance of &quot;Ben.&quot; There isn't much for me to comment about the hits themselves, except to say that unless you've been living in a 25 year coma, you're already familiar with 90% of this album.  But the problems with &quot;Number Ones&quot; are twofold: first, the tracklisting overlaps Jackson's previous hits album &quot;HIStory.&quot;  Do we really need yet another recycling of songs millions of us already have?  Also, not all of the tracks on &quot;Number Ones&quot; topped the chart, such as the excellent &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and &quot;Break of Dawn,&quot; a cut off 2001's &quot;Invincible&quot; that was never even released as a single.  Is &quot;Number Ones&quot; a competent survey of Jackson's biggest hits?  Yes, it is.  But is it a necessary purchase?  Not if you already own &quot;HIStory.&quot;  While listeners green to Jackson's work should pick this up, &quot;Number Ones&quot; brings almost nothing new to the table for those who already own his prior albums.
B0000TB03W|5.0|What an awesome dvd!!<BR>I was in Chicago for the concert and this was just like <BR>being there. Shania is a great entertainer.<BR>A must buy.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|\\"Let it Be\\" is the Beatles' most controversial record, given the roiling tensions within the group and with producer Phil Spector.  We all know that this album was initially titled \\"Get Back\\" and recorded before the monumental \\"Abbey Road\\" LP.  Paul McCartney never liked the idea of Spector, known for his sweeping orchestral arrangements, tampering with the group's sound.  He had major issues with the string arrangements on tracks like \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" which even some critics say were a bit overproduced and glossed up.  Well, 33 years after that release, \\"Let it Be\\" is re-issued sans Spector's production, and it very much sounds like the raw rock album McCartney probably wanted.  This is especially evident on tracks like \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" (a de-Spectorized version of this track can also be heard on the Beatles \\"Anthology 3\\") and George Harrison's \\"I Me Mine.\\"  But the tracklisting here is different.  For one, there's the excellent \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" which was previously available only on the \\"Blue\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\" compilations.  This version is definitely more rough in tone, with the guitars projecting with more force than I remembered.  So is \\"Let it Be\\" better naked or with clothes on?  Personally, I like both versions equally.  Fans who have been clamoring to hear this album \\"as nature intended\\" will definitely have their curiosity satisfied.  It was never really the group's strongest effort, but it's still a noteworthy album from a group whose influence can't be overestimated.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|i gotta say that i never liked britney before. But after hearing just a few clips from her abc special during random commercial jumps. i found that i really like the songs. So i go out and buy the cd to discover she's really grown. i never liked her before, in fact i was one of those people who intensly didn't like her. But this cd changed that around. Buy it, listen to it. Think about it.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Even in this stripped-down, cut-and-paste version, this is still the worst Beatles album of them all. Mediocre songs abound (&quot;One after 909&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; in particular), and the few decent songs are basically a drag. (&quot;Let It Be&quot; was covered live by The Hollies in 1970, and their version is better). I'd much rather listen to them from their early years, when they had inspiration and vitality. This is the sound of a band falling apart, and it ain't pretty.
B000002MU3|5.0|This is a hugely underrated album. After being a REM fan for many years this album still sounds fresher and, well - more fun than the rest. Needs a play-by-play analysis only hardouts like myself can offer!<br />Frequency Kenneth - classic guitar rock. 'He wore a shirt.. of violent green!'<br />Crush with Eyeliner - wickedly dirty distorted song. Wicked video as well.<br />King of Comedy - hard to love admittedly, a real grinder but still of merit.<br />I Don't Sleep I Dream - nice ditty, beatiful comedown form the previous two.<br />Star 69 - back into the sludge again with speed-rock par excellence. 'I know squirellies didn't chew the wire'!!!<br />Strange Currencies - epic, just like Everybody Hurts but better coz it hasn't been shoved down your throat for 10 years.<br />Tongue - bizarro ballad sung in Falsetto - brilliant and the true sign of the midas touch.<br />Bang And Blame - another original guitar sound and commercially acceptable to boot.<br />I Took Your Name, Let Me In, Circus Envy, You - the final four tracks are not as distinctive as the rest, with heavy distortion making them far less palatable to your casual listener. However stick by them and you can find some true melody - and You is truly EPIC!!!
B00005JLYW|2.0|Before I start, I should admit that I haven't seen the first CA film and the only reason why I saw Full Throttle in the first place was because Justin Theroux (Seamus -not 'Shamus' people- O'Grady) is in it. Same reason applies to why I bought the DVD. <br />That said, CA:FT is the most ridiculous and over-the-top film. I don't even know why people are explaining the 'plot' when there is NO PLOT. It seemed like it was simply an excuse for Diaz, Barrymore, and Liu to get together. I swear, none of them even tried to act (which is a great disappointment for me, since Diaz and Barrymore can be good actresses when they want to be. ie Riding in Cars With Boys; Being John Malkovich). Ditto for Luke Wilson and Demi Moore. The only saving graces in this film were John Cleese and Justin Theroux...and even then I cringed a couple of times at the brogue. But I can forgive an imperfect Irish accent, given that it is one of the most difficult accents to master....and, you know, how bloody hot he is (Good Lord did he ever get ripped! See his eppie on Sex and The City and you'll really appreciate how much he had to work out to get those abs). Yeah, I can be shamelessly shallow. Still not shallow enough to love this film simply for the sexiness that is JT.<br />2 stars. One for the film itself, and another one just cause I like Justin Theroux that much.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I absolutly love this CD. All the songs are about real things that happen in life and are not just about love. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" is one of the best songs I have ever heard. It is a great song about Womens rights and the double standards in life. \\"Fighter\\" is a song about not giving up and crawling into a corner and crying after something has happened its about staying strong and believing in yourself.\\"The Voice Within\\" is a beautiful song and probably my favorite it talks about believing in yourself and not giving up when there seems like theres no other place to go. Everybody has said she has changed into some slut,  well if you think that buy her CD and listen to \\"Cant Hold us Down and it might change your mind about her. Everybody changes at some point in there life and if you dont like the way she is then dont talk about her and move on. She has an amazing voice, and she speaks her mind. Just because shes 22 and dances around in short skirts and sings songs that are somewhat sexual, doesn't mean shes a slut, it means that shes the average 22 year old just caught in the public eye and judged about every little thing she does. I absolutly love her and I hope after reading this you will buy her CD!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Check out Go Britney.com or the countless other Britney sites and you will see even her DIE HARD fans are questioning the longevity of this girl.<BR>They vote obsessively at TRL and music sites from around the globe to 'help' her.They are worried that this new CD isnt selling well.<BR>I have enjoyed watching her actual fans and new fans alike discuss Britney because they will let you know what the TRUTH is about her with their worries and concerns and compulsion to VOTE over and over again for BRITNEY in the polls!!Lets Help her out!!!<BR>I think that we may be getting an break from this puppet and her record label in the coming years.<BR>I truly hope this manufactured Pop fake Girl/Boy band genre of music will stop flooding our airwaves.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love this CD!!!!!!!! I have been a fan of Britney since she first came out and even though she has changed a lot I think it is great and I love the old and new her. This CD features a lot of other great artists like Madonna, Moby, and R. Kelly. My favorite song on the albulm though is &quot;Everytime.&quot; The first time I listened to this song I started to cry. It is one of those songs that is about heartbreak that everyone has experienced and it really gets you in your heart. You can tell from her voice that she means every word she is saying.<BR>I would recommend this to anyone because it is trully a great CD and what I think is the best of her!!!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|After waiting what seemed like an eternity for his second album, I finally recieved it and was astounded. It's very hard for me to put words together to describe it because it affects me very deeply. This is one of the greatest albums of all time; his voice is beyond words, the songs are lush, romantic, gorgeous tracks produced by David Foster, the whole thing is just beyond words. The track 'Never Let Go' which Josh wrote with one of my favorite groups, Deep Forest, is a great track which is kind of different from the rest of the album. Josh also wrote 'Remember When It Rained' where he also fabulously plays piano. Another of my favorites is 'When You Say You Love Me' where he hits amazing high notes and is a truly gorgeous song. I've been thinking about writing a review for this since I got it, but now as I sit here typing it, I find words hard to put together. This album is just too amazing for words. Your life is not complete without this masterpiece.
B00005JKC3|5.0|For those of you who, like me, loved this movie: just check out how much of the negative reviews of &quot;Hulk&quot; were considered helpful by those who read them.
B00005JLZN|4.0|Set your politics aside and just enjoy a decent script with smart dialogue, an interesting plot, good acting, and very good film making.  I am a strong advocate for the death penalty, and this film in no way places my support for the death penalty on the guillotine.  While the script does have many logical flaws (funny since the screen writer was a philosophy teacher) and thirty minutes should have been cut, it is a fine thriller.  We are given an interesting \\"what if\\" wrapped up in a riddle that unfolds itself in an interesting, albeit calculated way.  An example of the clever writing and film making is found in one scene where an inhibriated David Gale (Kevin Spacey) utilizes the Socratic method by asking questions on the street to citizens about the very execution of Socrates, thus strengthening the character's political and philosophical commitment, challenging the issue, adding tension, and foreshadowing the final outcome all at the same time.  Spacey and the other actors do a fine job adding ethos to the characters.  It won't change your mind either way, and while it is less then perfect, this DVD is more interesting then almost everything coming out of Hollywood these days.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|One Wish is the Christmas album, that the public has been waiting for. This album is perfect from the songs picked to of course &quot;The Voice&quot; herself Whitney. Whitney offers a contemporary yet classic look sound to this songs. <BR>One Wish is the Christmas album of this season and for many seasons to come.
B00005JMGC|5.0|This movie was the greatest thing ever, next to the book Da Vinci Code. It promotes women the way they should be promoted, because let's face it ladies, we're the reason the world revolves. The sacred feminine has gotta be given its props, like it is in this movie. All my ladies out there have gotta see this becase its the best way to show you how to demand proper treatment, and all the guys have to see it to learn a little about treating their wife or girlfriend. I just wish the company wasn't so stupid and hypocritical.
B00005JMFR|5.0|Without big expectations I went into the film and I must admit that I was not only pleasantly surprised, but I was completely blown away its simply awesome!  The film has at last again a good story and the old atmosphere, besides such boring scenes from Reloaded are missing. Althoug there are many paralels to Return of the Jedi which I dont want to mention here. The film is simply fantastic, and I found it even better than the first part of the Matrix trilogy.  Only the end and the german synchronization is pure garbage, I hope they will release a Director'S Cut DVD.
B0000A0DRY|1.0|This &quot;remastered&quot; CD (the domestic CD with 4 bonus tracks and the 2 mono tracks) still does not sound very good!  Let me first state that I own three different CD reissues of Surrealistic Pillow as well as the '73 stereo LP, the DCC reissue stereo LP, AND the Sundazed mono LP.  Out of all of these versions only the Sundazed LP and the 1973 Stereo LP sound decent.  I even transfered those LPs to CDR to listen to in my car rather than suffer through any of those official CDs. I have the first reissued CD from a few years ago that has both the stereo and mono versions - great artwork, but terrible sound.  I have the import CD version with the 4 bonus tracks - slightly better sound, but still a disgrace.  And I have this most recent 2003 October/November released CD that is advertised as &quot;remastered from the original master&quot; (has the 4 bonus cuts plus the 2 mono cuts)- still, no significant difference soundwise from the other previously issued CDs.  Where does that leave a true fan who simply wants to hear a decent sounding recording of this historic LP?  Well, basically you need a clean stereo LP from the 60's or the 70's or the Sundazed Mono LP!  Note: the stereo DCC LP sounds the same as the CDs - very dissapointing!  What is the problem here?  In case you think I am some sort of an audiophile fanatic - let me point out a couple of obvious problems.  Clue number one - on this CD, the 4 bonus tracks from the same studio sessions sound much cleaner than the regular album cuts.  What does that tell you?  It tells you the master tapes are still missing for the main album cuts.  Clue number two is that there is DISTORTION on the vocals throughout this CD.  Anytime the music gets loud and you crank it up a bit you hear slight distortion, especially on the background vocals.  Folks, this is basic stuff.  Clue number three - why does RCA continually, and apparently endlessly, reissue Surrealistic Pillow?  Answer - because they still can't get it right.  This album needs to be remastered and REMIXED.  If the mixed down 2 track stereo master is shot, then they have no alternative - they need to completely remix this album.  Assuming of course they have not lost the original tracks.  There is hope here however, hidden in the last cut on this CD - after the mono White Rabbit track - is an undocumented instrumental track from the album without vocals.  So, apparently they do have the backing tracks!  O.K. then RCA, why don't you bite the bullet and remix the album?his album needs to be remastered and REMIXED.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|There's not a nick or tear on this gorgeous DVD presentation.  Audio is nearly as good.  Paramount has clearly put a lot of love and attention in ensuring that this 1969 film look as good as possible and they've succeeded.  As for the film... it's the best western and one of the best films ever.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is auesome!!!<BR>It's about A fish named Nemo,one day he gets captured by these divers so his father,Marlin,trys to swim after the boat that Nemo is in.But he's too late,Then he runs into another fish named Dory.(she has short term memory loss.)So Marlin and Dory go searching the WHOLE entire sea looking for Nemo,along the way they make some friends.Like the radical dude Crush the turtle.The not-so-radical Bruce the shark who goes nuts and trys to eat them.While Nemo is in a Dentist's office somewhere in Sydney,Austrailia.he meets the tank gang,Gurgle,Bloat,Gill,Peach,Bubbles,Deb,and Jaques(i don't know if theres more or not,i don't think so.)<BR>anyway you should definitly buy this on DVD it is auesome!!!The first DVD is useless because it just shows wide screen and the features suck,but the second DVD has Full screen edition and way cool extras.<BR>sincerly,<BR>    kenny
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I will try to keep this short and sweet...<br />How many sequals were as good or better than the original?  Not many, I can venture you can come up with few.  Look at Star Wars... even the &quot;original&quot; Trilogy, Episode 4 was far better than 5 &amp; 6, however, the trilogy as a whole was outstanding.  After seeing all three of the Matrix movies, I must say that this series beats the Star Wars Trilogy, and I was a die-hard Star Wars fan!  I looked at the series afterwards as a &quot;Biblical series for computer geeks.&quot;<br />More specifically, I must say that Reloaded was probably the weakest of the three movies, only because nothing will ever beat the fresh and outstanding Special Effects of the Original, and the last one leaves you thinking and comparing to no end... but this is a must to see if you want to understand what the Brothers envisioned at the onset.  The highway scene is simply amazing, the Smith Character really takes form, and even though some of the CGI in this movie has some visual flaws (the Neo vs. Smith Clones fight especially), the film is still brilliant none-the-less.  The only part that I have had to review over and over is the part where Neo visits the Archeitect (sp)...  he talks very oddly, and I had to re-view that scene many times to finally get the point of what happened.  Otherwise, this movie is a definate blockbuster, action, plot, effects, and otherwise.
0553382179|5.0|I have over two dozen &quot;get organized' books, from the inner issues to the outer ones.  I found this book by accident.  It has absolutely changed my life.  Even my family has begun to use the phrasing and techniques from this book. The changes have lasted four months so far. The rest of the books are now gone! <BR>The author simply and persuasively leads us step by step to a happier home, and each step builds upon the previous.  And there is no guilt about not accomplishing tasks -&quot;Even work done imperfectly blesses my family&quot;.  I have recommended this book passionately to friends and family, as well as the Flylady.net website.  The book is a better starting point than the website, because it is better arranged and more logical.  <BR>Gotta go shine my sink now!
0688170528|5.0|this was a great book! i could not put it down. from the very first paragraph Jodi Picoult keeps you reading until the end. it contains a lot of mature content but it's written in such a way that it helps the stoyline and development of the book. i recommended it to all of my friends and i recommend it to all of you reading this review!!!!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I'm not sure there's much to be said here that hasn't already been said by all the glowing reviews posted here.  A better tribute to George Harrison I have a hard time imagining.  Paul can barely keep his composure as he starts to sing &quot;Something&quot; on ukelele.  You can watch it five times and still have a hard time keeping the tears back.  It's almost like all the performers are slightly elevated, just a bit more spiritual than they might otherwise be, as a huge picture of George looks down upon them as they perform just superb renditions of his songs.  It made me realize how great his songwriting was, both words and music.  It made me feel a bit disappointed that his songs have not had the success and exposure that, say, McCartney's have over the years.  But maybe that's what makes them that much more special.  The secret's out!<br />To top it all off, this is probably the best-produced, best-edited, sharpest, cleanest-sounding concert DVD I've seen/heard.  If only all concert films could translate even half this well to DVD.  Five stars easy!  $20 for these two DVDs is a fabulous deal.  You all must think I work for the production company :)  If you buy any music DVD in the next year, you'd be silly not to make it this one.  Cheers to George and his friends.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney's new release is wonderful!!  I like &quot;Me Against The Music&quot;, &quot;I Got That (Boom Boom)&quot;, &quot;Showdown&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, &quot;Shadow&quot;, &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;, and &quot;Everytime&quot;.  &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, &quot;Early Mornin', and &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; are too repetitive!  They just seem to drag on forever!  &quot;The Hook Up&quot; is just okay...I'm not too crazy about it-maybe it'll grow on me eventually!  Some of the lyrics may not exactly be appropriate for the kiddies.  But guess what?  BRITNEY IS NOT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD ANYMORE!!  For crying out loud, she's 21 going on 22!!  She can't be catering to ten year olds forever!!  If you want kid friendly music, go pick up Hilary Duff's album!!  Overall, &quot;In The Zone&quot; isn't as strong Britney's previous releases, but at the same time it's still worth buying new!!
B0000CABBW|5.0|This film was wonderful!  The traditions, the interactions between the old world and the new world, and the scenery truly do justice to the life of a Maori.  The comment from a reviewer who thought it was to be a &quot;feminist&quot; movie and didn't understand the grandfather showing no remorse obviously has had no contact with a native culture nor, specifically, a Polynesian culture.  Boo hoo for you buddy.<br />Polynesians...this movie will fill you with pride!
B00008DDXC|4.0|Harry Potter is back, this time facing an ancient terror from the darkest recesses of Hogwarts itself!  Will he triumph?  Will good again defeat evil?<br />Naturally, you don't have to be a genius to answer the questions.  Chamber of Secrets is a darker, more forboding film than the first.  We are introduced to new characters.  There is Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco Malfoy, just as unpleasant, just as ruthless.  On the other side of the fence, there is the hapless house elf Dobby who continues to warn Harry Potter of a horrible danger.  Old friends are back - Ron Weasley and family, Hermoine Granger, Hagrid, and the magnificent Professor Dumbledorf.  We are introduced to some new features of &quot;wizard society&quot; such as the &quot;howler&quot;, a letter that lets a person know on no uncertain terms that they have messed up, how the wizardly world goes to great pains to keep itself secret from us muggles, or the unfortunate prejudice some pure blood wizards direct against those with muggle ancestors or parents, derisively referring to them as &quot;mudbloods&quot;.<br />Regretfully, there are two facts that prevent me from giving this movie a five star rating.  The first is the fact that it is a sequel, causing it to lose some of its novelty.  The second is is its time, it is longer than the first.  As such, I feel **** stars is proper.<br />Unless, of course, you are a true Harry Potter fan, in which case it will come across as *****.<br />POTTER POWER!!!

B000127LW2|5.0|Star Trek Voyager. I never really liked Star Trek before I saw Voyager. I was just channel surfing one day, when I came across the pilot episode, through some stroke of luck. The very first minute, I was hooked. From what bits and pieces of TNG I had seen, this was a great change. For one, it had a female captain. And Voyager also used CGI more beautifully than any other Trek I've seen. I love this series because it portrays human values and emotions in a true and touching way. Voyager is stranded 70,000 light years from home when they are pulled across space by a strange array by an entity called the Caretaker. When the Caretaker dies, he makes Captain Janeway promise that she will destroy the array before it falls into the wrong hands. Captain Janeway keeps her promise, leaving them with no way home. As they make their way across the Delta Quadrant, we see how they survive in an uncharted part of space while staying true to their morals and values. They take in other individuals into their crew, like Seven of Nine, and her struggle to regain her humanity is extremely well portrayed. Special moments like the first time Voyager gets to speak to their loved ones back home are really moving. Voyager is truly an amazing series - My mother, who was a total trek-hater, was hooked and never missed a single episode after watching one episode of Voyager. My friends, who scoffed at Star Trek, became die hard Voyager fans. There was a rumor that Paramount might not release Voyager on DVD, and I was truly upset that that might happen. Thanks Paramount, for deciding to release Voyager on DVD! I cant wait !! :) I'm so happy :)
B00009TB5G|5.0|First of all, the restored scenes are not frivolous. Their addition makes the movie feel complete, as if this is the way the movie should have been screened initially, simply because it answers so many questions, fills in so many plot holes, explains so many puzzles, and seemlessly sets the stage for the next sequel.<br />***Some spoilers discussed***<br />The most apparent thing after watching the Extended Version is that the restored scenes have managed to smoothen up the movie, making every scene immediately more relevant and meaningful to the entire story.It not only transformed the movie but it gave so much more pathos to every character in it. <br />Also, tellingly in particular two new scenes provide a wonderful stage for The Return of The King, explaining Gandalf's mission in finding the heir to the throne and Aragorn's rumored parentage in a very fascinating and intriguing account. These stray plot lines will ostensibly be the main plot lines for The Return of The King.<br />The Extended Version creates sympathy for all the characters involved. Very wonderfully, it shows alot of touching moments, and sometimes informative backstories, between characters: Eowyn and Aragorn, Frodo and Samwise, Legolas and Gimli, Faramir and Boromir, Merry and Pippin. The story simply becomes richer with these important additions, adding color, texture, and new layers to the film that was missing from the original. <br />It almost seemed as if with these additions, the movie has sprouted new branches and has become a so much more different in its entirety than its original counterpart. These are not frivolous additions, and sometimes makes one wonder why they were deleted from the original. Sitting through a 4-hour plus epic inclusive of these scenes wouldn't be a chore especially when the scenes deleted were of such a sumptuous and important quality.<br />Interesting to note: there's a very fascinating nugget concerning the lineage of Aragorn that was snipped from the screenversion but restored in the Extended. He, apparently, isn't really from the race of men and is realy *** years old (check it out for yourself). <br />The fight scene at Helm's Deep is longer than usual too, ending with a brief glimpse of the Huorns cleaning up the orcs. <br />Also, Merry and Pippin get extended time together, along with Treebeard, which makes for alot of laughs. The sudden explosion of so much colors in the storehouse of fruit was a nice epilogue to what was so much grays and blacks and blues of the previous battle scenes at Helm's Deep and Isengaard. It was reminescent of Bag End all over again. <br />In summary, The Extended Version with 40 mins plus of new scenes is worth the buy. <br />4 stars for the Original because I felt it dragged in certain parts, especially with Faramir.<br />But 5 stars for the Extended because the restored scenes filled up the plot gaps and lifted the draggy moments into a new level of storytelling. (The story line with Faramir takes on new meaning and deeper import, aiding the viewer to fully comprehend his dilemma, and helps elicit deep emotions when he finally decides to release Frodo. The added scenes immediately show the nobility of Faramir where Boromir failed. In short, the new scenes make Faramir a very interesting new character.) <br />In the Extended Verison, all the holes have been filled, all the puzzling pieces explained, many questions answered. <br />A great watch! Looks very different from the original.
B00000DLVA|5.0|Now Trip-Hop is a touchy subject, those that create it, say they don't...it's kind of like the existentialism genra of music. There really is no correct deffinition for what it sounds like.  So that leaves it up to the person to decyper what is or isn't trip hop.  There are entire bands that devote themselfs to this art, (but of course they won't define their music as \\"trip-hop\\") such as Porsihead, Massive Attack, Lamb, Ruby, Tricky, Cibo Matto, Sneaker Pimps, Morrcheba...I could go on and on.  But then there are artists that use trip-hop's dramatic and intence vipe sparingly, say on just one of their albums.  The Cardigens last album \\"First Band on the Moon\\"  that was not trip-hop...that was cheese-pop.  But taking their cue from the Bristol sound, they have put forth a haunting and suprising album.  From the very opening track the vipe for the entire album is set, dark, beautiful and myserious. A melodic human whistle sets up the tone, then \\"This is where your sanity gives in\\"  Nina Persson sings as a rythmatic thud is heard behind her.  The song builds up into a passionate tourture session, \\"The sweetest way to die\\" <BR>what a way to start an album...<BR>Third down the isle is Explode, a personal favorite, and I belive a crowning achivement for the band.  With a perfect melody the song, with a surreal touch, illustrates the battle with indiviuality, dependancy... on drugs...with govement...with life...all set to the backdrop of a slow chill beat and an almost flowing harsicord that drifts in and out of the song like air.    <BR>It should be mentioned that each aspect of creativity is extrodinary on this album.  Sharp catchy melodies were written by Peter Svensson, the dramatic production by Tore Johansson and simple yet powerful and inteligent lyrics written by Nina Persson.  <BR>Take for example the track Do you Belive, the smallest amount of lyrics on the album, but in my opionion, the most effective track.  A heavy and big beat that reactes to Nina singing, \\"Do you really think that love is going to save your soul/the world, well I don't think so\\"<br />This is not an album for optimists, it's very dark, but very passionate, it's almost obvious that it is a labor of love.  <br />If you like trip-hop, or more so, bands that experiment with trip-hop like Flaming Lips, or Blur, or Poe, I recommend fully.
630157401X|4.0|After the dismal Temple of Doom, I hoped the next Indiana Jones movie would somehow get the story back on track.  I hoped for three dimensional characters, a decent storyline, not one wild chase after another.  I am pleased to say Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was that, and a lot more!<br />Indiana Jones must go to Europe to find his estranged father, played by the great Sean Connery.  As fate has it, he finds himself drawn into his father's obsessive quest for the mythical Holy Grail, complete with nazis, femme fatales, and everything else that made the first film a hit.<br />Forget the second one, people, THIS is the true sequel.
0553381407|4.0|The authors review the outcomes of toxic parenthood, one of which is pathological narcissism. The toxicity is rarely in the overt forms of verbal, sexual, physical, or psychological abuse (the overwhelming view) - and often the sad result of spoiling the child and idolizing it (Millon, late Freud).<br />But one should adopt a more comprehensive definition of \\"abuse\\". Overweening, smothering, spoiling, overvaluing, and idolizing the child - are all forms of parental abuse.<br />This is because, as Horney pointed out, the child is dehumanized and instrumentalized. His parents love him not for what he really is - but for what they wish and imagine him to be: the fulfilment of their dreams and frustrated wishes. The child becomes the vessel of his parents' discontented lives, a tool, the magic brush with which they can transform their failures into successes, their humiliation into victory, their frustrations into happiness. The child is taught to ignore reality and to occupy the parental fantastic space. Such an unfortunate child feels omnipotent and omniscient, perfect and brilliant, worthy of adoration and entitled to special treatment. The faculties that are honed by constantly brushing against bruising reality - empathy, compassion, a realistic assessment of one's abilities and limitations, realistic expectations of oneself and of others, personal boundaries, team work, social skills, perseverance and goal-orientation, not to mention the ability to postpone gratification and to work hard to achieve it - are all lacking or missing altogether. The child turned adult sees no reason to invest in his skills and education, convinced that his inherent genius should suffice. He feels entitled for merely being, rather than for actually doing (rather as the nobility in days gone by felt entitled not by virtue of its merit but as the inevitable, foreordained outcome of its birth right). In short: a narcissist is born. Sam Vaknin, author of \\"Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited\\".visited\\".
B000005JA8|5.0|Okay...Yes, this is one of the most challenging albums that I have ever heard. It is by turns discordant, insulting, loud and irritating. It is all these things and more, you see, that make this album great.<BR>I have been that guy who has lent it to a friend and had it thrown back in my face, accompanied by all the usual spiteful remarks associated with the denouncement of such a work. It's interesting that nearly all nay-sayers of this album refer to things like the Turner prize. I love the Turner prize and almost anything considered 'modern' art. I also love Hendrix, Zappa, Pink Floyd, Miles Davis, Thelonius Monk, Beethoven and Bartok. These penchants are not mutually exclusive. The sickening thing about most modern-day music 'lovers' is their tendancy to trash anything that is truly different. A famous film critic once said, &quot;There are people who love movies, and there are people who love the movies THEY love.&quot;<BR>When it comes down to it, there really isn't that much stuff around that is hard to listen to. Now, I don't just mean challenging, and I don't mean hard to listen to like a constant ear-splitting tone; not physically difficult. I mean difficult like a literary tome or sprawling canvas from back-in-the-day. Something that wasn't written for 'you' per say. Difficult like 'Finnegan's Wake' or 'Guernica'.<BR>I've often said that when people start to think of Pink Floyd as truly experimental or ground breaking, then the creative world is in real trouble. Pink Floyd (and others; I don't mean to dis 'Floyd) are not difficult, they are just an aquired taste. The typical formula goes something like: &quot;People who like Zappa will like 'Floyd&quot; or &quot;People who like Tchaikovsky will like Prokofiev&quot;-it's simple, right? Sure, I agree, but don't you get bored of formulas? I do. So here's the really wierd part: There is a lot of difficult stuff that I don't like, but I still consider it some of man's best work. It's a tough space to occupy, but it's the only way I feel I can truly widen my horizons.<BR>As an example, I've probably only listened to this album twice in the past year. When I first got it, I yearned to know it, so I sat down, got stoned, and listened to it again and again and again...But now that I feel I know it as well as I ever will, that's just not necessary; basically, if Trout Mask Replica were a picture, then I wouldn't hang it in my living room, but I wouldn't hang &quot;The Scream&quot; there either. A lack of typical as-we-know-it beauty does not make a given work redundant OR unimportant.<BR>I guess what I really want to say is (if what I'm thinking CAN be properly expressed in words), just because you wouldn't put it on to relax to of an evening, doesn't mean to say it's no good.<BR>Be a person who loves music for goodness' sake; VOTE BEEFHEART!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I've wanted to hear what the Beatles really intended with the \\"Let It Be\\" album ever since I bought the original vinyl at first release.  (...)  The answer is here.  This is an amazing album.  It's clean, beautiful and simple.  (...)
B000000OSG|3.0|The worthy songs on \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" are so great, it makes it puzzling as to why the more trashy songs were blended with moments of accomplishment; by this time, Guns N' Roses had grown into a six-member team, and it was all for the better; their musicianship had developed, but a lot of the songwriting (for the most part) was uninspired at best; 'Get In the Ring' is one of the worst songs ever recorded by a major band, with Axl Rose spewing a trashy attack against the band's critics, maybe fuelled by his feud with Motley Crew vocalist Vince Neil...though it's funny Rose boasts in the studio, though he never responded to Neil's challenge to an actual fight. Other mediocre songs like 'Shotgun Blues,' 'Pretty Tied Up,' Axl Rose's \\"me-me-me\\" moment 'My World,' and the drawn-out 'Locomotive' don't help.<br />But when \\"Illusion II\\" shines, it shines bright; 'Yesterday, '14 Years,' and 'Estranged' are all brilliant, while 'Civil War,' 'Breakdown,' and 'You Could Be Mine' rank with some of Guns N' Roses' most accomplished rockers. A version of Bob Dylan's 'Knockin' On Heaven's Door' is intriguing and thrilling, except for the pointless phone call included in the midsection.<br />When one disregards the album's lows, \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" is a great album. Unfortunately for us, Guns N' Roses would never be great again.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|As a HUGE Britney fan, I was very excited to get this album; however, I was very disappointed after listening to it. It didn't live up to its hype & its so-called much more mature sound. In fact, her voice sounded weaker than all her previous albums. A lot of the songs like \\"Shadow\\", \\"Early Morning\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Touch of My Hand\\" are pretty boring--no climax in the music or vocals--very bland. She mostly whispers & talks in a sexy way than actually singing throughout the album. I wasted my money on this CD & this is coming from a hard-core BRit fan.
0553277472|5.0|I was rather taken aback when I read the reviews for this one. I was unaware that it was a love-it-or-hate-it book, not when I first read it anyway. Looking back though, I think that very possibly my mind-set at the time brought a lot to bare on my opinion and interpretation of this, Pirsig's most well known work.<BR>I vividly remember being on a car journey a few years ago whilst in the throes of a quite unpleasant mental breakdown. I was coincidentally reading the section of the book that dealt with cars. Mr. Pirsig speaks of the framing effect that a car window can have on the view of the outside world rushing by. He compares the effect to a television screen, intimating that, the society in which we live, so driven by T.V., tends to reduce everything to a spectator activity. Even the majesty of the outside world is reduced to the level of a nature program, hence his more breezy choice of transport. It was just one of those great moments that one can find through reading, when you look up from the page you're on and say, &quot;hmmm.&quot; I don't claim that it's an original thought, in fact it's almost hackneyed in this day and age, but it's not the actual conceits in the early part of this book that matter, rather the way in which they are presented. I felt from the car speech and others, not that new ideas were being expounded, just that they were being delivered in a very intriguing way; a sparce, concise way. I like to call this kind of style 'blue'. It's a word I first felt compelled to use when reading Kerouac's &quot;On The Road&quot;. It refers to that brooding, tip-of-the-iceberg intelligence that these writers can convey through the most spartan of sentences. Pirsig, I suspected, had more than just 'pop' Zen to deal with...<BR>As I read on, my suspicions were confirmed as Pirsig begins to reveal an entirely different side to his personality. Not even a side, far more another person, a person he names Phaedrus. The name comes from Plato's &quot;Republic&quot;. Socrates, whilst conducting one of his conversational seminars, is confronted by a young man who, because of his particularly intense and confrontational nature, is given the name of Phaedrus-The wolf.<BR>This for me was the clincher; not, after all, a pop science/philosophy book, but instead, an intense kind of thriller born of the most complex fear there is, the fear of one's self. That's not to say that the ideas of quality, Zen and motorcycle maintenance aren't tackled with wonderful aplomb, it's just that the real educational aspect of the book comes not from Pirsig's discourses on rotisseries and the like, but through the interweaving of two minds travelling different paths around the same idea. Not to give away the spectacular climax, one mind has a future, the other is history. Me-oh-my, the things we can learn from history.<BR>I loved the book, but as I've mentioned, I may well have had a more than usually good idea of where the author was coming from at the time that I first read it. I doubt this explains my affection for it entirely though, and regardless of your mental state, you should give this one a whirl.
B00009TB5G|5.0|As with &quot;Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; the extended version of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; adds critical dimensions to the theatrical release.<br />Even at over three hours per film, this story is too complex and subtle to be told briefly.  The addition of some of the best material that had to be cut for time considerations in the theatrical release make this practically a different, and far better film.<br />Assuming the upcoming &quot;Return of the King&quot; will maintain these established standards, I expect NewLine's Lord of the Rings will take its place as one of the very best film works ever accomplished, and will set a very high standard to be met for the future.
B000002P6R|5.0|The Who, especially Pete Townshend, had been unhealthy in dwelling on the fact that they were getting older (&quot;older&quot; being your 30s in rock and roll) since the mid 1970s on albums like &quot;The Who By Numbers&quot; and &quot;Who Are You.&quot; In 1978, legendary madcap drummer Keith Moon died, an event that forever shattered the band, and two years later, &quot;Face Dances&quot; reveals a group in a state of uncomfortable maturity and a yearning for wisdom.<br />Other albums, such as &quot;Who's Next&quot; allowed for The Who's growing maturity to be seen, but in those days, it was still with youthful arrogance. This is what makes &quot;Face Dances&quot; so unique. The Who are found in a frantic daze of disillusionment, unleashing track after track of enthralling energy.<br />The sound within packs a solid punch, in a vaguely pop-oriented feel, such as that of 'Cache Cache' and the excellent Top 10 single 'You Better You Bet,' as the mood is generated in a much more frenetic fashion in 'Daily Records,' 'You,' and 'Another Tricky Day.' Other songs like bassist John Entwistle's ironic self-portrait 'The Quiet One' and 'Somebody Saved Me' are minor Who classics. Kenney Jones, Keith Moon's replacement, proves himself to be a competent drummer, while Roger Daltrey's angry cries punctuate the album with essence.<br />Though it is without the pinnacles of other albums, &quot;Face Dances&quot; is definitely a worthy set. This album was the next-to-last studio album for The Who however, revealing the band's loss of desire, a fact which bitterly attaches itself to the songs here.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As you have read in other reviews (which are all dead on),there are no excuses!    Great performances  Great audio sonics  Great video  No Britney,Christina,Justine,J-Lo, or other jokes    If you don't buy this now,and I mean right now,then you will reap my utter disgust!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Holy smoke!  There can be no doubt that the Peppers are simply the most tallented, awe-inspiring group of musicians on the planet.This DVD is an absolute must have for any music fan. Words can not descibe how powerful this performance is. John Fruchante is a true visonary. The most innovative, skilled guitarist since Jimmy Hendrix he is. Funky Flea is Jimmy Hendrix.  Don't be a fool. Buy this DVD right now. Just do it. You Will be a better, smarter person if you do.

B000069AUI|5.0|I am usually a big Pop, R&amp;B, and pretty much everything else kind of fan. I got hooked on Coldplay after I first heard &quot;Trouble&quot; from their album &quot;Parachuttes.&quot; I was excited to buy this album, but also hesitant: Could they top their last album?. Yes, they could! At first I was like &quot;what the hell is this?&quot;-I had NO clue what was going on with the songs, and I did not like the album at all. I was really dissapointed- but then, I let it play continuously and slowly, song by song, Coldplay drew me in. The songs stay with you even after the songs are finished<BR>I like this album even more than Parachuttes(although that CD is just as good) The melodies are fantastically haunting- Chris Martin sings with so much soul-like he is really feeling what he is saying. Many artists can't do that, but he can. The lyrics: absolutely beautiful. They are written very well, and have an element that allows you to relate to them. Even if you have never experienced what he is singing about, you still feel as though you relate-now that is the mark of a good singer/songwriter! Please, if you don't have this album, go buy it! :)
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I heard Britney's new cd \\"In The Zone\\" playing in my local music store and I decided to listen to it from one of their audio sampling machines. All I can say is the music itself is nothing but electronic beats and keyboards. Her voice is covered up by much of the electronic music which isn't a bad thing because Britney's voice is just average. There wasn't one song that stuck out as being exceptional, this is just a mediocre cd that mimicks the likes of Madonna, Christina Aquilera, and Janet Jackson. I'm a female and I enjoy girl groups/singers, but give me Stevie Nicks, Carly Simon and Carole King anyday over Britney. Even when those singers were in their twenties they were far more talented singers than Britney will ever be.
B000084T18|4.0|I gotta say, 50 Cent got too much hype.  He's in the LeBron James category.  He is real hot, with endless posssibilities, but he can't live up to the hype.  On the other hand, Get Rich or Die Tryin is one of the hottest albums I have.  He is one of the realest that is on the scene now, and he knows how to use it on his tracks.  I got mad respect for him still being alive.  The cd isn't the best, but it is hard as hell.  50 has the advantage of working with Eminem and Dr. Dre, and he uses it to full advantage.  He has production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Rocwilder.  He also features Eminem, Nate Dogg and G-Unit mate Lloyd Banks.  The hottest tracks on the cd, What Up Gangsta, Patiently Waiting, Many Men, In Da Club, If I Can't, Back Down, P.I.M.P., Don't Push Me, Wanksta, and Your Life's On the Line.  That's a whole lot of hot tracks for one cd.  Maybe this deserves a five star.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Freaky Friday is the BEST MOVIE of all time!!!  It is comedy filled, hilarious, sweet, and to the point.  The perfect screenwrite with the perfect actors and actresses.  I really, really like this movie because of all its perfect scenes.  It's about a mother and a daughter who switch bodies mysteriously.  They live a day in eachother's shoes, literally, and see how hard it is to get by.  It is a non-stop laughter kind of movie, and if you love funny, you'll love this movie!
B00005JMD3|1.0|There was no story here - it seems like they went through and took bits and pieces of the 70's show to come up with this film.  It was a waste of some pretty good actors' time - it was just plain dumb. The writer(s) and filmmakers figured they had a prefab hit so no creativity went into its making.  It's your basic - outsider is brought in to build a team of rebels who, in the end, beat the bad guys and impress the authority figure they were rebelling against.  Even the borrowed use of cutting to video screens (as a \\"hip\\" technique) was old and tired.
B00005JMFR|2.0|It is unfortunate that this series of films turned into such a disappointment.  The most interesting story angles and questions posed in the previous movies were either completely ignored later on, or brushed off as trivial -- thus creating several inconsisencies.  <br />The series should not have begun with such heavy intellectual and philosophical tones if they were to be given last seat and only continued in a half-assed manner throughout the subsequent films.  Though many may have just wanted the entertaimnent derived from the visual effects or action sequences, with which I don't argue, the films have no maintained integrity beyond this point.<br />Matrix Revolutions has a miserable script, sloppier effects than its predecessors, and many cut-off and unfinished story lines.  And since it has become more action-oriented, the sub-par acting is not unexpected, but still proves annoying.  Furthermore, because it did not live up to what is expected of \\"the final installment\\", it became an even grander failure.<br />If the Matrix series had held true to the original, I think it would have been incredible.  But apparently it was more important to have a bloated box-office-topper than a good film.

B000000WF0|5.0|What more can I see this is the best and favorite CD that I own. This is the one album that every music loving human should own and love. What more can I say the Album is brilliant. Songs such as &quot;The Drugs Don't Work&quot;, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;,and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; are masterpieces. The Best Rock Album ever made!!
B00000ILDE|4.0|This movie talks about a group of people on a rescue mission and end up fighting aliens. if you have watched the first alien movie and you like it, you will simply love this movie. great plot and good special effects for movie. however, i feel that picture and sound are rather weak. the extras are limited as well. mostly are text based info. nevertheless, this movie must be in your collection.
B00005JM02|5.0|My children who are 2 and 7 LOVE this movie. They want to watch it every day. For my two year old, it is hard to find a movie that she will sit and watch. So far though, everytime I put it on she sits and watches the whole thing! The characters are loveable, and quoteable. We all walk around saying parts of the movie. All I can say is this movie is the best movie I have seen since The Lion King.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|This adaptation is rather disappointing. It seemed as if under time pressure, the ending in particular was overly compressed. They would have been better served making a mini-series out of it. It's OK, but you won't be enthralled.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney Houston's One Wish: The Holiday Album is in my opinion one of Whitney's most rewarding and uplifting albums she has ever heavenly sent to her fans. Forget about the media, the tabloids, and the disappointment of her last album, Just Whitney, &quot;THE VOICE&quot; herself has made a tremendous effort to rise once again through this body of art. The first song I just WANTED to hear before my mother bought this was &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; featuring miss  Bobbie Kristina Brown! Immediately from hearing that sweet and already womanly voice from Bobbie Kristina, I fell in love with all the rest. My other all time favorite Christmas songs on here are &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas,&quot; &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; and &quot;Joy To the World&quot; (it's hard to tell if that version came from The Preacher's Wife soundtrack...i believe that she added a little something special in there...it sounds completely different from the soundtrack). All in all, I hope any fan or used-to-be-fan can give Miss Whitney a chance, she has come back with something very rewarding and special for us to share with loved ones on the holiday through peace, joy, and love from heaven to earth.

0060930187|1.0|First off, why exactly did Esther Greenwood have this breakdown?  I looked for clues in how she talked and what she talked about, but could only assume various items.  In a work of literature, I don't care who you are, it is important to answer all the readers' questions.  Why did she have the breakdown?  What was the underlying motive for attempting suicide?  How did it affect the rest of her life after all was said and done?  I did not get the answers to these questions after finishing the book.  This made it hard for me to care for Esther as much as Plath probably wanted each reader to.  I just didn't understand where Esther was coming from when she ranted on and on about how fabulous it would be to die.  I couldn't feel her pain because I didn't know where it came from.  Same goes for Joan.  There wasn't enough of her character to really get into to feel shocked and upset at the announcement of her death.  Secondly, there were quiet a bit of failed metaphors in the story.  Plath used the death metaphor too much and in the wrong places at times.  Finally, I didn't get a final resolution out of this story.  Esther mentioned near the end &quot;How do I know the bell jar won't descend again?&quot;  That deprives the story of any climatic ending right there.  I mean, so what if she's let out of Belsize, if the bell jar descends again, then why does this entire ordeal that Plath told matter?
078579901X|5.0|This Hercule Poirot mystery is set on an island resort.  In this exotic setting, the vacationers watch each other, and learn a bit about each other's history and personalities - and gossip about the flamboyant, and possibly unfaithful wife, of one of the guests.  When she's found dead, the investigation shows the guests have many secrets - suspicions of murder, financial difficulties, previous romantic entanglements with other guests.<br />As is typical of many Christie stories, it's one of those secrets that is key to solving the mystery.  <br />Classic Christie puzzle plot with engaging characters.  Well-written and a very enjoyable read.  Recommended.
B00005JMFO|5.0|What's not to love?  The Director, Richard Curtis has created another winner!  If you love NOTTINGHILL and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL as I do, you will adore this endearing, light-hearted romantic comedy.  This movie is chock full of Great Britain's greatest and most adorable actors (and let's not forget about Laura Linney from USA).  There are all of my favorites, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy) along with Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Alan Rickman and Rowan Atkinson among others who star in little vignettes about love.      I love to go to movies that make me happy.  Imagine going to a film and keeping a smile on your face during the entire time.  Of course there were moments of deep emotions where I (as usual) shed some tears but even these instances turned into deep laughter.     I loved all the fairy tale endings in this movie.  All lived happily ever after, no matter how ludicrous the story line was.  Even the story involving Laura Linney was not sad to me because she was making her own choices.  I plan to buy this DVD as soon as it becomes available--4 WEDDINGS AND NOTTINGHILL have been worn out and since I am a hopeless romantic who loves happily ever after endings, I know LOVE, ACTUALLY will get a lot of viewing time!

B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is a very nice follow-up to LP's debut album, Hybrid Theory. Unlike HT, Meteora has that drop-d sound in almost every song, thus making this sophomore album heavier. The lyrics seem a little lazier done than on Hybrid Theory but I completely understand you can't make a perfect thing more than once. Not that the lyrics were bad I could really relate to Meteora's lyrics more than HT's. Chester and Mike collaborate with each other just as well as they have been, and the guitars and bass are earthshakingly heavy. The drumming seems to be a little more matured and complicated which makes this newer sound seem more grown-up. As well as Mr. Hahn, the most fabulous DJ, his scratching is more apparent in this CD too. If you liked HT but was turned the other direction by Reanimation, don't let that opinion make your choice for you. I am telling you:<BR>BUY METEORA. IT ROCKS.

B00005OM5L|5.0|I am totally gobsmacked to hear some people say that Clappers is'nt as good a guitarist as he used to be. He has clearly became more fluid than ever and some really sophisticated slides and moves.I sit in awe at his abillity and each time I play this dvd I think of who is actually better,considering different styles as well. I think &quot;Five long years&quot; is my favourite track. I really enjoy Son Seals and many other pluckers but Clapton will always be the greatest for me. Too bad he does'nt find time to get down here very often,what.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|What is it about Britney Spears???<br />How does she manage to be so successful and put out such horid music? Why do people praise her and go crazy over this stupid, ditzy,talentless skank?<br />These questions I will never be able to answer because clearly America is enthralled by her and I think it is very very sad indeed<br />All I can say is if I could give this CD a zero rating I would in a heartbeat...And at least Christina Aguilera can back up her skanky image with an amazing voice..Britney is just a waste of space in the music business today..Stick to dancing hun.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Very impressive CD- Like her or not (personally, I love her), Pink has one of the best, most soulful voices that you will ever hear.  Listening to her is almost like being invited along for a night out with her- crazy and scary at times, but definitely worth the trip.
B00005RZV4|5.0|ive always had bad experiences with live albums...but this one is so good...this cd makes me feel sad though because i never went to see the tour, cuz if it sounded this good on the cd it must have been SOOOO good to be there in person...i almost didn't buy it because of my bad experiences with live albums, it DOES NOT matter whether or not its live,, it basically sounds like a greatest hits collection to me.<BR>trent, who seems to be kind of a perfectionist, was pretty brave by putting out a live album,cuz even if you don't notice,or care it has its tiny tiny mistakes, which dont even sound bad its just not the exact version of the original song (which it shouldnt be anyways, since its a live cd)...<BR>there is another 2 disc version of and all that could have been which is kinda rare, so if you want the second disc ('still') but dont want to buy anything over again go to, [...] and you can buy the second disc there...still is mostly a lot of piano tracks, remakes of old songs, and the actual song 'and all that could have been' which is a pretty mellow track, but its so awesome....of coarse there is the live dvd or vhs with some live stuff which is really awesome (the best live footage ive seen in a while)<BR>so basically you need to get all of these things to have the full halo 17, and you wont regret it because they are ALL worth it

B0000CD5I6|5.0|I came across a glowing review of this release by chance on AMGs web site.  With trepidation I bought it. As most objective music lovers will acknowledge, Jethro Tull gradually became something of a guilty pleasure after the critical debacle of Passion Play.  They became one of the groups really bashed (\\"prog rock\\" or \\"self indulgent\\" were terms most used) by critics such that even when they could be great in later years (which was rare from my incomplete knowledge), no one was listening. Of course, this happened to pretty much all non punk or non new wave bands in the late 70's and early 80's.  However, the early Jethro Tull was so spectacularly good that even die hard punks hid there copies of Thick as a Brick or Living in the Past to play while no one was watching.  Which brings us to 2003's Christmas Album; there was always something about Jethro Tull that sounded Wintery in an English pub kind of way. This is no musak rendering or nostalgia fest, it is an album that every Rock fan who ever loved Jethro Tull's early style of minstrel/folk rock will want.  By the way, Ian's voice (which I've been told was \\"lost\\" for some years) is exactly as it was on the early classics.
B00005JM02|4.0|Being only one of the very few Southern Aussies to own an American edition of Finding Nemo has been a very proud moment for me thanks to Amazon. The only other Australian's with Finding Nemo are those with pirated copies from the flea-markets. Well done to Pixar for all the extra little bits... what an amazing team you are! Of course I woul d have loved to have seen the actors in action doing their voice overs but this would have to be the ONLY set-back. We only see about 3 people in the bonus bits. To all the 15 million owners of this DVD already we don't need to encourage the 'rest' of the western population to buy it... the sales figures says it all. <br />**** out of ****** from me...
B0000DJZA5|5.0|No other band in history has done more to influence society and culture than the Beatles did after some 8 years together and a dozen studio LPs. The Beatles are responsible for a lot of &quot;firsts&quot; in recorded history -- taking recorded music to the limits, experimenting with different sounds and musical influences, and printing the song lyrics. Even after the Beatles disbanded in 1970, their mesmerizing affect on society is still felt. Indeed, there will never be another band like the Beatles.<BR> <BR>The music in &quot;Let it Be. . . Naked&quot; has been available to Beatles fans through bootleg recordings for many years. The sound quality in a few of these bootleg editions is quite good. But, in others. . . well, you know. . . . caveat emptor, especially when it comes to underground music recordings. <br />This recording, however, gives the listener a fresh perspective on the &quot;Get Back&quot; sessions. For openers, the tapes have been remastered and cleaned, providing excellent sound quality. Although Beatles fans are familiar with the songs on this CD, the warmth and freshness of a true studio recording session is felt. This is the way the Beatles wanted &quot;Let It Be&quot; to be released in the first place. Gone are the Phil Spector orcestra and choral affects and the interlude pieces -- &quot;Maggae Mae&quot; and &quot;Dig It.&quot; Instead, an outstanding uptempo version of &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; has been added. The studio banter heard on the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; LP has also been eliminated, except for Lennons famous:  &quot;I hope we passed the audition&quot; at the end of the CD. <br />I do not believe that this is Sir Paul McCartney's attempt to rewrite the Beatles' Legacy.  Ringo Starr and George Harrison (to a degree) agreed on this project.  Yoko Ono also agreed with this project.  As a matter of fact, Ringo Starr give this release a power endorsement.  McCartney may have a big ego.  But, that is not the case with this recording. This is, simply, releasing &quot;Let It Be&quot; the way the Beatles had intended it to be released.   <br />Overall, in my opinion, this is an improvement to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album that die-hard and casual Beatles fans can appreciate. And, Yes, the band has passed the audition. . . . . Again!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|After all the hype and calculated publicity stunts, Britney has delivered another great album. The title track departs far from the rest of the album and does not pave the way for repreated track after repeated track, like her previous albums were somewhat like. The album fits best in the club scene and provides for a great dancing and grinding mood that is sure to get your @ss shakin'. As the music industry moves more towards hip hop, Britney jumps on the band wagon and does a fantastic jop of reinventing herself. Great tracks include Tocuh of My Hand, can't wait for that video!!!, Breathe On Me, Eveytime, Toxic, Outrageous, early Mornin' and well just about all the songs find Britney moaning and groaning and singing some of the greatest lines in music today! Shadow is a great song but it really doesn't fit with the mood of the rest of the album. But Britney definately doesn't miss on this album and she achieves what she has set out to do, get you in the zone!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|First of all, let's try and not have people who hate Britney Spears in the first place write reviews, flat out just find something better to do.<BR>Ok back to the CD, as we all know Britney is not a hardcore musician and vocalist, nor does she claim to be. In The Zone offers the best of what she is, fun pop music, just like Madonna. Nobody ever said all music had to be serious with just raw instruments.  This album is definitely a step up in the production and the overall feel of the album seem to be very well executed. She experiments with several new types of beats while still keeping it somewhat close to &quot;old school&quot; Britney so it's not contrived. This entire album is good, some songs sound pretty good @ first then grow on you a lot and you love them. The only song on this album that could have been a little better is Outrageous by R.kelly, it's still a good song, however he could've written a few more bridges in the song, the chorus is a little too repetitive. Other than that this is a GREAT Britney album, Everytime is one of my favorite tracks, it is very raw and simple, very nice:)<BR>Good Job Britney:)<BR>And for those haters out there the album has already sold almost a half a million copies according to Nielsen Soundscan, but nice try.
0790732521|4.0|As Michael Collins is going to be one of the three individuals in the Irish independence movement from the Easter Rising to the formation of the Irish Free state that I'll be examining in my senior seminar paper next semester, I refreshed myself in rewatching this movie.  Director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game) paints a vivid portrait of the history of the final and crucial Irish Revolution against the British Empire and the man who made it possible, Michael Collins, &quot;The Big Fella,&quot; (1890-1922).  If one was to make the comparison of the Pen, Voice and the Sword made on the three main people who united Italy (Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi), Collins was Ireland's Garibaldi, but also its Christ.<br />The movie begins with 29 April 1916, the last day of the Easter Rising, where the undermanned Irish surrendered to superior British artillery.  Collins and his friend Harry Boland are captured and fortunately avoid the fate of others like Sean MacDiarmida, and socialist intellectual James Connolly, the latter who is badly wounded and is executed strapped to a chair.  Eamon de Valera, future president of Ireland many times over, has his sentence commuted, partially because of his New York birth.<br />Collins learns from the mistakes of the Rising and with the help of Harry and Joe O'Reilly, sets about creating a band of assassins who use intelligence, wear the uniform as the ordinary man on the street, and the element of surprise to gun down members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and G-Men.  Both groups are considered collaborators with the British, traitors to Irish independence.  Before long, British elite police auxiliaries, the notoriously brutal Black and Tans are sent in, and they too become targets for the IRA.<br />There is a standout scene reminiscent of the final scene in the Godfather, where Collins' gunmen take out members of the Cairo Gang, British intelligence specialists who operated in the Middle East and were sent to deal with the IRA, quickly followed by the infamous massacre at a football game, where 14 people, including footballer Sam Hogan, were gunned down by the British searching for Sinn Feiners, and over a hundred wounded.  Bloody Sunday indeed!  While not condoning the British treatment of the Irish, it shows how retaliatory violence leads to the deaths of the innocent.  But as history has shown, there was no other way for the Irish, except by fighting.<br />Many aspects or themes from Tim Pat Coogan's biography on Collins have either been altered or not emphasized, which is understandable for a movie with limited running time.  For example, Ned Broy, the G-man who secretly helps Collins, survived instead of being tortured and killed.  Three Irishmen were tortured and executed the day before, and Jordan clearly decided to use their deaths and Broy as a composite character.  Another is the band of assassins Collins uses to carry out his hits.  Coogan's book refers to them as the Twelve Apostles, which using a Christ-like metaphor to Collins as the saviour of Ireland.  That isn't alluded to here, which is unfortunate.  And the action slows down in the final quarter hour, a contrast to the first two hours.<br />The leads do well, Liam Neeson (Collins), Aidan Quinn (Harry Boland), Julia Roberts (Kitty), Alan Rickman (de Valera), and Ian Hart (Joe O'Reilly).  The latter two would be reunited in the first Harry Potter movie as Professor Snape and Quirrel, respectively.<br />Those who know the story of Michael Collins will know how the story ends, but there is cutting back and forth of scenes of Kitty trying out her wedding dress to the final ambush, with Sinead O'Connor haunting rendition of the traditional &quot;She Moved From The Fair&quot; making it all the more poignant.  And de Valera is portrayed as someone who wants independence but with strategic violence, not the bloodbath Collins spreads, and but in the end, a Machiavellian manipulator.  Indeed, he did say that Collins legacy came at the costof de Valera's own standing, and that is definitely true in this movie.of de Valera's own standing, and that is definitely true in this movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the CD I've been waiting for all this year!!  Britney takes her underground sound one step further by getting rappers, Moby, R. Kelly, and the May Trix to write songs on her new album \\"In the Zone.\\"  The beats are bangin' and the lyrics articulate the struggle of a woman transitioning from a little girl to a sex kitten!  If you think she's just a manufactured dumb blonde, then you need to listen to cuts like \\"The Hook Up,\\" \\"Outrageous,\\" and \\"Me Against the Music\\" with Madonna.  I know lots of people complained about that kiss between Britney and Madonna, but I don't really think she's a lesbian.  She did that for shock, and you fools fell for it.  Anyway, Britney is an underrated musical genius with a BIG future ahead of her.  Forget crap like the White Stripes and Coldplay.  If you wanna know the future of music, look no further than Britney.  Get this album NOW.  She will NOT disappoint.  If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  I really would.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|The album itself is grea. As a long time fan of tool, I can see where maynard goes with this as compared to tool. I gave the album a 4 instead of a 5 because the song &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is a cover. Yes, a cover. Just look up the band Failure, on their album Fantastic Planet.
B0000TB03W|5.0|People often fall in love with an artist because of their music and what they hear on a CD or tape. But with artists like Shania Twain, you'll like her music but you'll fall in love with her after seeing a live performance.<BR>Up (Live in Chicago) is a non-stop energy fest with 22 excellent songs and surround/digital sound. The DVD also allows you to flip through the songlist and play individual songs. Or you can sit and enjoy the whole concert at once. The quality of the image is excellent, which will of course depend upon your television, and if you have a few speakers, you'll certainly enjoy the surround sound feature. <BR>Shania and her bandmates look and sound great. They make such an excellent ensemble and their performance in this concert is worth every penny. You rock Shania ;)
B0000028W9|5.0|This was my first Leonard Cohen album and still my favorite. With intelligent lyrics, simple yet intoxicating melodies, and an underlying sensuality, every one of these songs will seep into your conciousness and never leave. From the subtle groove of &quot;Waiting for the Miracle,&quot; the infectious &quot;Closing Time,&quot; the thought-provoking &quot;Democracy,&quot; to the simple beauty of the instrumental &quot;Tacoma Trailer,&quot; Cohen takes the listener on a magical journey that you will want to take again and again.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for literally anyone and everyone.  Just because it is Dinsey, doesn't mean that it is only for kids.  My boyfriend and I are in our mid twenties and LOVE it.  The turtles themselves in the movie are well worth the buy!!
B000089RVX|4.0|Yes the songs are great .... the band is good they paly well but what stands out is Amy's voice and her piano playing ...well the rest of the band i cannot say much as there is not much talent in Guitar player or the drummer nor the bassist..Mind you they play well but nothing great..there's not a single solo riff or a few moments of solo instruments...<BR>  Its not that i dont like the music its great but i sure hope they can get better in their next album  as there is lots of spaces to improve upon....But all in  all Amy stand's out with her amazing haunting voice  ... kind of reminds me of Greg Lake of ELP..Anyway its  a good start and a good album as well..
B0000DJZA5|1.0|First thing I noticed; Same cover design as Nirvana's &quot;Bleach&quot;. I suppose the Beatles decided to get into the whole &quot;strip the production down&quot; mentality that all grunge bands lived by... fifteen years ago. The Beatles had obviously missed the bus on the whole grunge movement, and they're trying to compensate way too late by putting out an underproduced version of something they'd already done. Compare &quot;Bleach&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; covers; each have inversed photographs in the same exact area of the cover (in huge strip going across the center), and they both have the text in the same exact places.
B0000CFW87|3.0|I am giving 5 stars for Josh voice and his singing, and 2 stars for the song selection. \\"Closer\\" is much further than his first CD, which I think was just great. There are 2 good songs, but the rest ???. Common David Foster, you can do better than that. Put a few fast ones. A lot of people are listenning on their way to work... you don't want them to fall asleep, do ya? What about song Caruzo? It's done by Bocelli perfectly. Is David  trying to prove that Groban can do a better job? Have no idea.... Let's release the third CD and let's make better song selections, because Josh is one of the best singers around who deserves standing ovation. Cheers.
B000003TA4|2.0|Oh please. Whomever keeps saying Pearl Jam is better than Nirvana needs to let up. Pearl Jam is worse than Nirvana, yet I despise both. They both sold out. Vedder gladly obliged to be a media puppet, and Kurt knew what he was getting into when he signed with a major. Yet Kurt still didn't care to  fufill what was asked of him. He had always been lazy, and Nevermind reflects that. It's pure pop-rock on par with Bon Jovi, and he refused to admit it. There's no punk sensibility to it at all.
B00005JMF6|3.0|This movie was great but had it's bad points. I thought the acting in the movie was actually really good. Nice and believable. The plot of the story kinda seems plotless at first. But actually had a nice twist on the end. I had a fun time making jokes in between silent scenes in this movie (there are alot of them) I made the theater crack up all night and it was great. The movie isn't bad but isn't great either. Wrong Turn or House of 1000 corpes was better but this movie had a nice plot and a great twist on the end. I would probably buy it depending on my mood. Who knows but it was great and bad at the same time. I guess you could say....it was alright. Wait for a rental.
B000002IM7|4.0|Most long-time King's X fans feel that their first two albums are also their best two albums.  To me, they both seem a little rigid and uncomfortable.  But, of course, they are great overall and chock full of catchy and hard rocking tunes and the start of a great (and anonymous) career of making mind blowing rock and roll music.  King's X combine some of the best elements of The Beatles, Black Sabbath, and Boston in their music resulting in a sonic brew that will blow you away.
B0000TB03W|5.0|From the moment she takes the stage singing &quot;Man! I Feel Like a Woman&quot; to the final song &quot;Rock This Country&quot;, Shania proves she is the Ultimate Rock N' Roll Diva!   Her energy and songs blended with her fashion flair make this a great must have for all Shania fans.  All Shania fans: this is will be a great addition to your collection!
B000089RVX|5.0|I picked up this CD after hearing the two &quot;singles&quot; from this album on the radio. This CD is wonderful. The lyrics are very intelligent and sung in heart wrenching fashion by Amy Lee who has absolutely the best voice I've heard in quite a while. The music is very well thought out and produced in perfect compliment to Amy's vocal talent. One of the highlights in my opinion is a beatifully arranged vocal/piano composition called &quot;Hello&quot;, I had to stop everything I was doing the first time I heard it to let the goosebumps go away. If I had to pick a negative, it would be that the album does not show too much range. In other words, all the songs are similar in sound and nature, with no wide departures. But hey, this is their first album, and things like that don't become a problem at all until/if the band showed no evolution on second and third albums. And in fact, this has obviously been the downfall of other albums where artists try to show too much range in style, leaving you with only 1 or 2 great songs on a CD. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this, and in fact, suggest highly that you add it to your shopping cart RIGHT NOW. I would even go so far as to say this is a must have for any well-rounded  collection
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney is an intellegent person, her vocals of course aren't ever going to be as strong as christina or jessica's. But let's face it Britney, since she first came out has showed the world what she really is.. a performer. Just wait until the tour and that will make her album stand out even more. The songs on this album are grown up, sexy, and deffinately something to dance to. Britney has done it again, stunned everyone with her image. Thank god she's back ;)
B00006V9A0|5.0|Not Complete NIRVANA But Great For Newbies.<BR>I really can't think of any &quot;Best Of&quot; CD that has all the hits and great songs of the band. I mean if you had to put NIRVANA's &quot;Best Songs&quot; on CD you would have to add every song!!!<BR>If you're not a fan yet buy this and very soon you will have all the other NIRVANA CD's you'll see<br />If you're a fan and you havent got it yet pay the money just for one track &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; it's pure bliss to listen to.
B00005T7HX|4.0|Yeah, it's a little overblown and melodramatic, but it's also genuine, beautifully acted, and inspiring. Dreyfus is a music teacher at a local high school. He fancies himself a composer, and he is, but circumstances and fate keep him from devoting himself full time to that pursuit: his wife's unexpected pregnancy and the fact that the child born of that pregnancy is deaf. The end is predictably a rousing and emotional tearjerker - but still, it works just fine.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Nothing to be appalled at here.  Although it has been fashionable to express disappointment with the Spectorized version of Let It Be, I have always enjoyed the album.  This issue of an original,clean Let It Be is even better.  The music of the band and the singing are there to hear and enjoy.  This CD is a real pleasure to hear.  Anyone that is looking for radical differences may be disappointed but those who wanted to hear a more true session will be pleased.
B0000541VQ|5.0|Whoa! Before watching this one, round up a lover, some satiny red wine, and a box of Godiva chocolates. It's a sumptuous extravaganca celebracing wickedness, betrayal, decadence, depravity, and sexual intrigue among 18th-century French aristocrats. Glenn Close and John Malkovich, former lovers and highly evolved cynics prey upon the emotions of innocents Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman. But then Malkovich actually starts having human feelings for one of the women, thus betraying the terms of the `liason,' and the Marquise (G. Close) begins plotting her revenge.<BR>Yowie, don't miss it. But you've gotta be in the right mood, and you've gotta have the right person to watch it with.
0446530891|3.0|When I was approximately half through the book I was riding in an elevator with the book in my hands and another guy pointed at it and said \\"Not one of his best\\". I looked at him as if he was crazy, since the book had me reading every second I could get and was looking very promising.<br /><br />When I reached page 300 I completely understood that comment, the plot turns into something so farfetched that it made me want to throw the book away. I am not sure what the author and the editors were thinking. The only reason why I give this book 3 stars instead of 1 is because the first 3/4 of it are really good.<br /><br />Anyway, my final recommendation is: Don't waste your time!
B00006LI4S|5.0|I can't say that I have heard anything more beautiful. This has a great mix of work from each era, songs from other writers and one previously unreleased song (smile) as far as I know. I would suggest this to anyone that has even a minor interest in the band. Even my wife, who wasn't really a fan, has now changed her opinion. She will actually sit and listen when I put in the DVD. <br />In some songs the digital audio is awesome (The grand piano seems to be right in the room with you.) and in some others it isn't too noticeable, but all of them sound great. David's voice along with the way he plays the guitar is unmatched by any other artist.<br />The only improvement would be to re-record David's rendition of &quot;Don't&quot; from the tribute concert in 5.1 channel audio (It is still wonderful though) and to have MORE, MORE, MORE. Something from the Momentary Lapse of Reason would be nice.
B00004YKUY|5.0|The new lead singer sounds very much like Steve Perry.  In fact, unless you are a Journey connoisseur you won't even know it's not Steve Perry...  He probably sounds better than Steve Perry would have at this point.  The songs on this cd are phenomenol.  Excellent melody, lyrics, musicianship etc.  This is probably close to being the best Journey cd ever, excluding, of course, their greatest hits collections.  It has a disproportionate amount of ballads, but that's what we all expect from Journey.  And the first song &quot;Higer Ground&quot; is a decent rocking tune.  I feel the cd is simply touching...  I was listening to track 8 before writing this review.  The ballads on this cd are so good that anyone who dislikes this cd must not have any musical feeling whatsover.  Don't get me wrong, Perry's old stuff like &quot;Faithfully&quot; and &quot;Open Arms&quot; will always be hard to touch, but this cd has some songs that are right there...
B000060MMI|5.0|When i first listened to this Cd (one of my friends gave it to me), i wasn't sure what to think.<br />Well, I know am obsessed with the band.  The music of soooo cool and it being Irish and all, I love it.  If you like this type of music, you might like Drop Kick M urphys or Seven Nations, which are alos really cool Irish bands.  The music is so good.  Som eif it is all quiet with bag pipes and sounds really cool, and others is all loud and punkish and is even cooler.  Most songs are a mix of both.  Great music.
B000068TPN|4.0|In this Vietnam war epic staring Mel Gibson, we are thrown into the very first confrontation between U.S and Korean soldiers. This is of course the famous &quot;vally of death&quot; battle. <br />Mel Gibson's character, Col. Hal Moore (not a ficticious character) leads his men into battle knowing that the Koreans are waiting for them. When you reach this part of the film, it gets good. However, the first part of the movie, consisting of Gibson training his new crop of men, and spending time with his family, is more fluff than anything. The hour long plus exposistion is what brings this movie down. Want to show that Gibson is a family man? Ok, but dont show it for near an hour. Nearly all of this time is needless (although not terrible), with the exception of a memorable speech by Gibson, where he states that: &quot;dead, or alive, we will all come home together&quot; <br />However, if the hour long, quintessentially 60s exposition was shortened, this movie would be very close to Private Ryan (my favorite war film). The battle starts, and it doesnt end untill the movie does. In it, we get to see some of the most brutal footage ever captured, even compared to Saving Private Ryan. The scene in which napalm is dropped too late and torches a few American soldiers comes to mind; I may never get that image out of my head. That effect was too extreme for even my taste. <br />The battle is wonderfully shot, however. We get more character developement in these scenes then we do in the lengthy beginning. <br />See this movie before you buy it, because it is not for everyone. Some may be chased off by the extreme violence, others by the long first part. I however, liked the movie quite a bit, and consider it to be a good modern war movie.
0061015725|2.0|Creighton is an excellent writer in that he can spin suspensful prose and can write in a manner where you can't put the book down.   He wrote a very good premise and develops his characters nicely at the beginning.    That's why I picked up the book and read it to the end.   However, it was just filled with plot problems that make you just sit there and roll your eyes:<br />-    The number one flaw in this book is that he makes his characters act so stupid.    They pick at each other with childish barbs and act like 5 year olds when they know they are exposed to death and destruction which can only be solved through teamwork.    I just don't know why Creighton fills several of his books with this trait -- this book had the disease worse than I've ever seen in a Creighton book.  Creighton ought to go spend some time in the military so see how humans really act when in critical situations.<br />-     Why was the main character called out to the site?    It never answers the question.   Nobody wants his skills and yet this call is fundamental to the whole plot.<br />-     Why can the swarm kill a rabbit quickly, yet some characters can be attacked big time and yet are fully recovered in a few hours?    I'm not being picky -- this is the basic issue that the plot revolves around.<br />-     Why does every single person keep the production facility going even though chaos and destruction are reigning from the previously produced particles?<br />-     Why are the characters smart enough to have created the particles, but so stupid they won't even try to see slightly into the future as to where the thing is heading.     This just ruined the believability that had been set up by good writing style.<br />Bottom line, Creighton has good style but you can drive trucks through his plot line holes that occur time and again within this book.     Those holes then leave me uninvolved as I read on.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|My title for this review came from the weekend section of the Washington Post the week this film came out. I used it because it is my exact feeling about this movie. <br />In the first Matrix, we are witness to some of the most mind bending effects ever made, well, at least until this came out. In addition to those effects, we are also witness to a great, heavy story line. It was such a fresh idea. The best parts of the movie were with Morpheus and Neo, in the beginning, where everything is being explained. Wait, how does that work? The story being the best part? Whoa!<br />Flip the equation for this movie. The story takes the backseat, while the mind bending stuff gets to drive for a while. Now, don't get me wrong, I prefer it the other way too, but I sure dont mind watching Neo beat up lots of Agent Smiths in the impressive Burly Brawl sequence, and I sure dont mind watching the greatest scene that has anything to do with cars since &quot;Bullit&quot; and &quot;The French Connection&quot;. I have to admit though, the bullet time stuff was overused. The beginning with Trinity comes to mind. I thought that sooner or later, they would slow it down when characters were walking down the street.<br />I dont get what people dislike about this movie. It still has story, which is evident with the visit to Zion, the Architecht and the best scene in the whole movie, the visit with the Oracle. The Oracle was why I liked the first one so much. She is so different from what her name suggests. She alone makes the movie worthwhile.<br />I could not concievably get through this reveiw without at least talking about the freeway scene a little. One word comes to mind: Whoa. This is what action fans live for, and what people who appreciate story more (like me) should cherish as one of the best chases in cinematic history. The combination of physical and digital effects is seemless, and the part in which the trucks collide is probably the greatest, most perfect effect ever.<br />I wont give away any more (in case anyone hasnt seen this movie), but I will say that this is very close to the original in terms of fun.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is by far the best material these guys have put out. I think most of the bad reviews are from die hard DT fans who like the gay broadway musical side of DT. I think that side sucks ass. This, however, is ballsy in your face well performed rock. Progressive rock/metal doesn't need sappy piano ballads and sissy vocals to be excellent. Listen to Opeth. Sure, they have the terrible cookie monster vocals, but there is nobody tapping in to their femanine side on the acoustic songs. This new DT is a big leap forward. Still, there is probably to many keyboards, but they are well done. The die hards can go listen to crap like Spock's Beard if the want that annoying Yes sounding stuff. I'll take this any day.
B000002HPV|5.0|I bought that record the day it went out, in 1997. I still listen to it often, and I still get the same feeling I had the first time I listened to it: complete and infinite awe.  Bjrk is one of the most talented artist of our time, and she proved it to the world with this record.  There seems to be a little something new to notice at every listen, each song is beatifully written and uncovers raw emotions with the intricate lyrics and passionate strings in background.  If you have a surround sound system, the experience will be even more amazing.  An essential in absolutely everybody's record collection.
B00000DFRS|5.0|This album i have to say is one of Whitney's best. Every song on this album is wonderful. <BR>especially you'll never stand alone.<BR>This is a must have 4 every Whitney or RnB fan!!<BR>WHITNEY 4 LIFE!!<BR>Peace Y'all..
B0000TB05A|3.0|Originally shot as a personal memento by the band, \\"U2 Go Home\\" was pushed into release by the group's ardent European fans, who lobbied and clamored for its release after portions of the concert were broadcast on worldwide television as \\"U2's Beautiful Day.\\" While it is a valuable addition to any U2-philes collection, the simple fact is that the video, audio and overall performance is not up to the bands usual professional standards. Casual observers who take a chance on this DVD will probably be left wondering what all the fuss is about.<br />Still, \\"U2 Go Home\\" does have its charms. The venue, Slane Castle outside Dublin, is as picturesque and romantic a setting as one could ask for a major rock concert, and with the death of lead singer Bono's father just a few weeks prior, there is a strong emotional bent to the whole evening. But this performance and DVD must be compared to the November, 2001 release of \\"Elevation 2001 - U2 Live From Boston,\\" which was meant to be the definitive chronicle of the groups hugely successful 2001 Elevation tour.<br />In almost every respect, \\"U2 Go Home\\" falls short of that prior release. This was the last concert of the second leg of the tour, and in listening to the audio and watching the performance, it's clear the group needed the month-long break that would come after this show. Bono tries hard, but the intensity and performance just are not equal to the task at hand. He's noticeably less active than usual, and the whole group seems hindered by a case of road weariness. Bono forgets the words to some of the songs, and his voice is weaker than on the Boston DVD. While he's not bad, it is hard to come away from this show with an appreciation of him as one of the world's great singers, which he is.<br />The song list is very similar to the Boston DVD. In almost every case, the better versions of some of the group's classics like \\"Elevation,\\" \\"Beautiful Day,\\" \\"Desire,\\" and \\"With or Without You\\" come from the Boston DVD. There are a few notable exceptions, like \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" which is one of the few moments where the band's fire and intensity really picks up. There are also some nice moments in some of the songs that are different from the Boston set list. \\"One\\" is particularly good, as is \\"Out of Control,\\" the group's first single from the \\"Boy\\" album.<br />The visuals suffer from a clear lack of preparation, probably due to the fact that this is basically a revved-up home movie. The lighting, camera placement, and editing lack the flow and energy of the Boston set, even though it is directed by Hamish Hamilton, who also did the Boston DVD. The audio is good, but a notch below the Boston DVD as well.<br />All in all, U2 Go Home amounts to little more than a snapshot of the band on an average night. Still, as a fan, I appreciate getting some different songs from the earlier Boston DVD. However, fans might have been better served if this was treated as an \\"Authorized bootleg\\" sold through the band's website. I'd much rather have had the earlier video releases of the Zoo TV tour and \\"Popmart Live from Mexico City\\" get the full DVD treatment.<br />In the end, I can recommend this DVD to fans of the group, but anyone wanting to give U2 a try for the first time should pick up the Boston DVD instead.a few notable exceptions, like \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" which is one of the few moments where the band's fire and intensity really picks up.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Man oh man!  You know, for a guy like me who is into anything that is pop, rock, rap, or on the darkside, this album not only opened up my eyes that this chick DOES ACTUALLY HAVE talent but also it made me take a closer look at her as an artist (I could care less about her as a person).  Anyways, I read the review of this album on The Washingont Post and read that it gave such a great review on it that it made me more curious of what does this CD have to offer to me as a listener?  Of course I picked up the CD and then I popped it in my car and felt the thumpin' in my car with the deep heavy bass that the first track &quot;Me Against The World&quot; with Madonna and from that point on I wanted to hear more.  Then the next track was &quot;BOOM BOOM&quot; with the Ying-Yang Twins...and then another...and another...and when I reached to the 8th track (&quot;Outrageous&quot; produced by R.Kelly) I was so into Britney's 'Zone' that I wanted to be IN THE ZONE with her and dance with her!<br />DO NOT LET THE TITLE FOOL YOU!!!   Britney has truly grown up in this album not only as a singer and artist but also as a songwriter and this is very important!  I should know because I am a producer in house music!  To have that chemistry justtttt righttttt.....and to mix it with the right beats and lyrics you have an instant classic of a song.  PARENTS: DO NOT PICK THIS ONE UP FOR YOUR KIDS!!!   Upon hearing the lyrics to the songs, she has her 'fantasies' with men that made my glasses fog up but I would give this album a 'PG-13' rating!<br />But anyone who DOESN'T LIKE Britney OR LIKES BRITNEY I recommend this album BIG TIME!  Hey, I didn't like her from the get go but upon hearing this album I respect her as an artist.  But like I said before as a person...well...we'll just wait and see what other women she'll be kissing soon!
B000084T18|3.0|50 Cent, new arrival of Shady Records, is trying to make a name for himself on his debut album, \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\", a good attempt, but needing creativity.<br />The first single is one of the stand out tracks of the album, a long with a few others like \\"Wanksta\\", \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Back Down\\", but the album is comprised of mostly what every other rap artist is doing now.  Cars, sex, and more gun shots are heard of on the album then what its really about.  50 brings interesting elements to a few songs, but could use backup on those that should never have been thought of as \\"CD material\\".  <br />Most of the songs just become an identity of another song on the album.  The beats are good, here and there, and the raps get interesting.  But, the album just needs something new.  It is the same thing you hear from every other artist in rap now.<br />An overall outlook:<BR>Intro --<BR>What Up Gangsta 3.5/5<BR>Patiently Waiting 4/5<BR>Many Men 3.5/5<BR>In Da Club 5/5<BR>High All the Time 4/5<BR>Heat 2.5/5<BR>If I cant 2/5<BR>Blood Hound 3.5/5<BR>Back Down 4/5<BR>P.I.M.P 4.5/5<BR>Like My Style 3/5<BR>Poor Lil Rich 4/5<BR>21 Questions 4/5<BR>Dont Push Me 4/5<BR>Gotta Make It To Hevan 3.5/5<BR>Wanksta 4.5/5<BR>U Not Like Me 2.5/5<BR>Life's On The Line 3.5/5<br />50's got potential, he just needs to apply more creativity to his work.  Nice debut though.
0790729407|4.0|Passionate screenplay and breathtaking cinematography, supported by Goldenthal's top notch background score: this film truly surprised me.<br />Plot-wise, you will learn a lot about the Irish rebellion against the British. The story, I found on some googling, has some crevices (e.g., Ned Broy was NOT murdered by the Tans as shown in the movie, in reality he survived the whole thing and went on to become the first head of the Gardai, the unarmed Irish police force.)<br />Yet, the superbly executed plotline unravels with an exciting pace, and is easy to follow. I was riveted.<br />Acting-wise, tight convincing performances all around, seems they couldn't have selected anyone better than Liam Neeson to portray Collins, although Julia Roberts was a bit expendable (and what's with that ill-achieved Irish accent!) Alan Rickman as de Valera was stunning as usual.<br />Despite its length, the film does full justice to the inspiration character of Collins. Recommended!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Title of my review sums up the album. What we come to expect from Dream Theater. However, this time, a whole album of songs performed in the aggressive style that they have always hinted at in concert and albums, but never fully followed through with. Even with the aggressive nature of the music, they still show the prowse of giving even the hardest lick some melody.   <br />Bravo gents, bravo
B000065V9P|5.0|The fact that I don't like some of the songs on this, yet am still willing to give it a five star rating should tell you how great this album is.  Like I need to.  Look at all these reviews.  By sheer virtue of having &quot;Secret World,&quot; and &quot;Love to Be Loved&quot; on the same CD, this should have a much higher overall ranking.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|History repeats itself again, and McLachlan has put out a very good yet over-produced record.  Sometimes I wonder if these songs would generally be better as just stripped-down versions instead of being so glossed up with studio control-board fluff and effects.<br />Aside from the opening track &quot;Fallen&quot;, there don't seem to be any real stand-out tracks.  &quot;Train Wreck&quot; has a disturbingly annoying squeaking sound in the background.  Thought at first it may have been a defective disc, but that's not it.  That very subtle squeaking noise is annoying enough that from now on I will skip that track entirely from now on.  The only other problem I have with this disc is a lyric line from the chorus of &quot;Push&quot;.  I can't remember it exactly right now, but you will probably recognize it when you hear it -- listen for the line that sounds rhythmically and tonally clumsy, not to mention sappy.<br />But I DO LOVE SARAH'S MUSIC!  Really!  Despite the tone of this review!<br />But the next time she makes us wait 5 years for a new record, how about a little more than 10 tracks, okay?
B000002NHN|5.0|It's impressive the talent and the versatility of this great woman.  For me, she is the Queen of World Music at this moment in the world, because she's able to unit the celtic, scottish, arabic, medieval and pop music in one work like no other artist.  As Ofra Haza, Ishtar and Natacha Atlas are female icons of the Middle East music, Enya of the Irish New Age, Nana Mouskouri of the Greek Pop Music and Sarah Brigthman of the Soft Pop European, Loreena is the greater female icon of the World Music. <br />In this album is difficult not agree in which HIGHWAY MAN is a tremendously song by their great quality, although it's a tragic story. THE SONG of Book Of Secrets. DANTE'S PRAYER is beautiful melody, almost religious. MARCO POLO is like to dream with the route of this medieval explorator from Turkey to China, fantastic the arabic percussion with the Loreena voice. PROLOGUE and MUMMERS' DANCE are the perfect begin, with that songs mixes almost all the rythms of the world in their musical agreed.  SKELLING is wonderful, magnetic, an unforgettable ballad.  LA SERENISSIMA, for fly the imagination with the sounds of the arpa and violin. And NIGTH RIDE ACROSS THE CAUCASUS, my favorite, the song that better reflects the spirit of fantasy and music of this album.<br />In my opinion, Loreena was incomprehensibly the great absentee of Lord Of the Rings Soundtrack.<br />For the music lovers, she's the new queen.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a good album to own. Its fun and makes you want to dance. I think Brit did a good job on it and made it a little bit more personal than her other albums. Don't just pass up this cd because you don't like Britney because my best friend is a Britney hater and I made her listen to it and she ended up really liking it. So just give it a chance, you won't be disappointed. Best songs on the album: Toxic, Breathe on Me, and the Hook up.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Dispite bad critic reviews, I truly enjoied this album. It's a more mature, introspective Sarah, and very refreshing considering the current trend in popular music.  If you like her previous albums...this is a sure bet.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|If you can see only one Robin Hood movie in your life, let this be it! Forget about Fairbanks, Costner and others - Errol Flynn is the perfect Robin Hood in this all-time classic. It does tend to become too sentimental at times, and we all know the story and the ending already, but this is still a masterpiece of the genre.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's Up live in Chacigo really is great. It is a must own dvd. I would recomend anyone to buy this dvd, because she is so up beat in this show.
0140386335|5.0|This is one of the greatest fantasy classics ever written, and Michael Ende certainly deserves at least the same recognition as Tolkien.<BR>This story has it all: Likable characters, a unique setting, lots of both action and comedy - amd it makes you think, too. For anyone who likes fantasy, this is a must-read, and for everyone else: Read it anyway!<BR>For those of you who have only seen the abysmal and absolutely horrible movie: Please read the book, so you won't go around thinking Ende's story is that bad!<BR>And for those of you who are lucky enough to never have seen the movie: Don't! It doesn't do the book justice in any way whatsoever!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Peter Jackson's version of Tolkien's The Two Towers was wonderful on the big screen, but the real edition is here -- with 43 sublime extra minutes, which add greatly to the narrative and aesthetics of the theatrical film. As other reviewers have mentioned, scenes with Boromir & Faramir, the Ents and Eowyn flesh out Tolkien's story. (One extra scene, in which Pippin and Merry fight over Ent Draft, does not ring true, but otherwise these added and extended scenes are fantastic.) In this film the Fellowship has been split up -- Merry and Pippin are being taken to Isengard by orcs with Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas in pursuit, while Sam and Frodo carry the ring into Mordor.<br /><br />And the fun doesn't stop there! There are four discs in all, and the extras are incredible: featurettes galore -- on production, design, Gollum, the screenplay, Weta, sfx and editing; photo galleries; and FOUR commentary tracks. These documentaries are hours and hours of fun. You'll learn what sound effect is made using a swinging cheese grater, watch PJ and his editors making changes right up to the last minute, watch someone storm off the set and see the dedication of the cast, extras, stunt personnel and the entire crew. Everyone seems to have cooperated with the production of this edition, so you'll find interviews and comments by over 100 cast and crew members. There is a lot of material here, but interactive menus and a printed guide help you navigate, and the material really adds to your enjoyment of the film and the process of making it. If you loved Peter Jackson before viewing the extras, you'll adore him afterward -- an inspired, hardworking, genuinely nice barefoot genius!!  (Some extras are accessible only to those using a PC with Windows 98SE or later.)<br /><br />The packaging is nice, with a map and line drawings on the case and discs, and new art by Alan Lee on the cover.<br /><br />If you love Tolkien's books or the films, this extended set will make you very, very happy!
B00005QB42|5.0|I have a collection of &quot;new age&quot; music, including chanting, chakra clearing, meditation and relaxation.  This CD was so much more.  Before Deva Premal I thought WAH! was the best when it came to chanting on a rhythmic, easy to listen to scale.  This CD is so very much more.  You just float along with the chanting.  And since I attended a recent retreat at Samasati - track #6 - was a special bonus.  Although she spells it differently, I'm sure it is the same retreat.  A extremely uplifting experience.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar makes great films, and FINDING NEMO is no exception.  Nemo is a young clownfish living with his dad (voiced by Albert Brooks) who is taken by a scuba-diving dentist to live in his office tank.  When Nemo's dad takes off after the boat to get his son back, he meets Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), who tries to help him despite her horrible short-term memory.  Along the way Marlin and Dory encounter sharks, turtles, jellyfish and seagulls, while Nemo befriends his fellow aquarium dwellers, who are busy planning an escape.<br />While I think the first segment of the film, in which Nemo's mother and all his siblings are devoured by a predator, should have been omitted, the movie is otherwise a lot of fun and very entertaining.  You might want to skip this first segment if you are watching with young kids.<br />The disc set is loaded with great feautures, including the film in widescreen or fullscreen format, a virtual aquarium, commentary track, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a documentary on exploring the reefs with Jacques Cousteau's son, trailers, a short film, a game and many featurettes.<br />Great movie, great deal!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have never thought of myself as a POP fan...but this CD has turned my head that's for sure! It's really awesome. I LOVE the new sound she has....I definitely recommend this CD!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I was truly looking forward to this CD and was hoping to hear fresh, new material. AFter all, Britney's people had been pumping this album, saying she would come back with something hot and new that we had never heard before. So I bought the CD and listened to it. I think it's good, fun music. I take that back...this is not really music. There is no substance. This is Britney's 4th album and you would think she would have changed and evolved from her first album 5 years ago. But I can't help but notice the similarity between this album, and her others. The lyrics are still basic and dull. The subject matter is still fluff and forgetable. And her voice has not improved at all. I think this is a great CD to dance to, but this is by no means real &quot;music&quot;. There was no originality in this whatsoever. I've heard all these songs before, because they were all recycled from music done years ago by Madonna, Janet Jackson, and every other &quot;popular&quot; singer there was. This was the pinnacle of Britney's goal, to make popular music. She didn't strive to make original, creative, inventive music, and it is obvious. All she cared about was that people would like it, and that it would sell. That, in my opinion, is not an artist. And this CD, in my opinion, is terrible. <br />I would much rather recommend Mandy Moore's &quot;Coverage&quot;
B00000099Y|5.0|Im going to start off by saying just one word...wow!  <BR>This band has really got it's sh*t together.  They know exactly how to construct heavy, dark music, yet at the same time its mellow, soothing, and oh so complex.  Adam Jones takes you further on his experimental guitar voyage on this one...If you are a musician, writer...or even just anyone who thinks they know what good f*ckin music is all about....Dig in to this one, im sure you'll like it, and if you dont, well f*ck you, go listen to britney spears.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|What exactly is this re-mix?  I will tell you.  Phil Spector's mix of these recordings was typical Spector: very thick, and heavily produced.  Phil's style was never to have the music sound natural.  You likely have heard of the typical description of Phil's output: &quot;The WALL of sound.&quot;  This NEW mix takes a completely different approach.  This new mix shoots for a completely natural, almost dry sound.  The sound of each cut now is close to how a live performance in a small hall would sound.  The tracks sound very clean now and one can easily hear each instrument and voice.  I can now hear details of the drumming and bass playing that were never clear in Phil's mix.  Personally, I am not a big fan of Spector's approach.  I often find the wall of sound to be a wall of mud.  I like Paul's new mix because it sounds so clean, natural and UN-produced.
B000002MUW|5.0|I love this album. It's a wonderful transition from Madonna's ever so famous Erotica. This album shows that although Madonna has done some naughty things in the past, she does have a softer side. Madonna's voice and R&amp;B music come together to make a silky smooth sound. On this album, you hear Madonna own up to the &quot;provocative&quot; things she's done in the past and that she has nor regrets. (Human Nature)The best songs on this CD are: Take a Bow, Secret, Survival, Bed Time Stories and many more. This album is worth a 10!
B000089RVR|4.0|Hullo to y'all!<BR>this is a pretty good CD-- however, not for those who prefer energy-pumped music.   (yes, take PJ Harvey, as this glynenergy maniac said.) whoever they are, their life must be extremely boring. but it must be fun to antagonise iall of these die-hard dido fans.<BR>bit of adigresson there-- anyways, it seems that Dido is getting  back on her feet, after her first CD was preveiwed mercilessly on Nickelodeon,  which would warp the credibility of any album.  i first heard White Flag while at target (yay!),  and was impressed, both by the suave tone of Dido's voice, as well as the great cinematography used ot make the music  video. <BR>to anyone who enjoys low-key, melancholy pop that is actually pop. (White Flag is one of the most commonly downloaded CD's on the ITunes Music store.
B000002LGQ|5.0|This is one of the best of all of madonna's 16 albums. The album has songs like Promise to try, Till Death Do Us Part, Oh Father and Keep it Together that describe madonna's past. Every song has an irresistable rythum and meaning full lyrics. The CD features the classics Express Yourself and Like a Prayer 2 of Madonna's most memorable songs. If you want to own Madonna's best peice of work buy this CD! You won't be dissapointed.
B000127LW2|4.0|This set of DVDs includes all 15 episodes from the first season, exclusive featurettes and bonus material. The episodes are in full screen format (widescreen would have been nice - hence 4 stars. Of course, since it wasn't originally created in widescreen format, this full-screen format is understandable) with newly remixed Dolby Digital English 5.1 tracks and English Dolby Surround.  The episodes from season one are:<br />Disc 1: <BR>Caretaker - The series premier. While Voyager is in pursuit of a Maquis ship, both vessels disappear into an area known as the badlands where an unknown phenomenon sends both ships into the Delta quadrant.  There they suddenly appear on what appears to be a farm but is really a laboratory in orbit around a planet. Two crewmembers are missing and Captain Janeway follows a signal from the laboratory to a planet where they find the missing crewmembers.  But how did they get there and why were they there?<br />Parallax - Voyager encounters and area of space with heavy spatial distortions where they come across a ship that is trapped in the event horizon of a collapsed star.  Voyager unsuccessfully tries to rescue the ship but can't by itself and speeds off to try to find help.  But as they head away from the star they realise they're heading right back to it! They must come up with a plan to escape from this anomoly.<br />Time and Again - While investigating the source of a disasterous shockwave encountered by Voyager, memers of the crew are transported back in time to the day before the shockwave was created.  Trying to get back to their ship before the disaster occurs, they encounter a group of protesters outside a government polaric ion power station who plan on destroying the facility. One of the worst Voyager characters, Kes, plays an important role in this mission with her \\"latent Ocampan psychic abilities.\\"<br />Disc 2: <BR>Phage - During an away mission, the other weak character from Voyager (but still better than Kes), Neelix is attacked and apparently killed.  When found by his crewmates it was discovered that his lungs had been removed. The Doctor is able to implant holographic lungs that keep him alive but confined to sick bay.  Another away mission is sent to find out what happened and they discover a medical lab full of organs from different species.  Just then Voyager detects an alien vessel leaving orbit and Voyager takes off in pursuit.<br />The Cloud - Voyager explores a nebula rich in omicron particles, which might prove useful for the ship's energy reserves. But when Voyager enters the nebula, it encounters an energy barrier that brings the ship to a dead stop. Breaking through, the ship continues its penetration of the nebula and are attacked by organisims that attach themselves to the hull and begin draining energy from Voyager...<br />Eye of the Needle - Voyager encounters a wormhole that might take them back to the alpha quadrant but it's too small for the entire ship to enter so a probe is sent through.

There they discover the inhabitants have a device that can fold space, allowing travel to places even as remote as 40,000 light years away.  This could be the crew's chance to get back to Earth.  But will the Prime Directive prevent obtaining it?<br />State of Flux - While searching for food on a planet, a Kazon ship is detected in orbit.  After a brief conflict between away teams the Voyager crew makes it back safely and breaks orbit.  A few days later a Kazon distress signal is received and Janeway feels obligated to respond.  It turns out to be the same Kazon ship encountered in orbit at the planet they just visted and there is only one surviving member of the Kazon crew. The weapon signatures indicate Federation technology was used in the destruction, but how?  While investigating the cause of the destruction, another Kazon vessel arrives in response to the distress signal...<br />Heroes and Demons - Ensign Kim in trapped in a holodeck simulation of Beowulf during a freak accident involving beaming samples of a protostar onto Voyager.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|At first when I heard here Me Against the Music song, I thought it would be okay. But then I remembered all the stuff about her kissisng Madonna. Also here video for that song was really gross. The end was just like on stage. Although Britney did kiss Madonna, I kind of have simpathy for her. Nothing ever came up about Madonna kissisng Christina. Well, I found the picture of Madonna kissing Christina the same night she kissed Britney. Plus, all the songs on her cd are really babish. They all sound as if she were eleven years old. Sorry Britney but after hearing about the Playboy thing and crap, I was just a bit grossed out. She'll be out of business before you know it.
0375805613|5.0|The number 1 problem with this book......you will get sick of it long before your kids do! Now, I don't know if you've ever had to read a book to a group of energetic kindergardeners.... but it's hard to find one that will keep them all interested. Well, last year we discovered this book, and we read it so many times that by the end of the year it had fallen apart! A truly amusing book that will keep all the kids interested and not make the reader want to vomit from saccharine sweetness or corny plots as many children's book do.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|i like how it goes from a hip hop flavor -to a trance like sound -to-rnb-to ballads. Her voice seems to sound better than it did on her last multiplatnium cd and she is now finally showing signs of maturity
B0000E1WNV|2.0|Disappointed to say the least, the mix sounds like a &quot;decent audience tape.&quot;  I can't believe it.  It's disgusting.  I compared the broadcast version against the &quot;real&quot; DVD and the broadcast sounds like a soundboard.  The &quot;real&quot; DVD is a disgrace.  My guess is that Landau and Co. wants the fan to feel like he's at the show.  Well duh, I'm not at the show, I'm in my living room, where I have close-ups of his nostrils and overbite.  I should have a soundboard to go with those close-ups.<br />Ranting?  Yes!  It's a good thing it only cost me $12 bucks.  On a positive note the video looks good.
079213690X|5.0|Reviewed Date:  November 2003<BR>Studio:  Paramount Studio<BR>Genre:  Epic<BR>Exposure:  Color<BR>Running Time: 177 minutes<BR>Rating:  R<BR>Release Year: 1995<BR>Directed By:  Mel Gibson<br />Starring: Mel Gibson and Sophie Marceau.<br />Within the movie Braveheart there is a story of heartache, love, destruction, and war. The movie is taking you back into time to the 13th century in Scotland.  Mel Gibson plays William Wallace.  Wallace finds love more then once in the movie.  The movie has a lot of blood shed with the wars that are fought.  Wallace is portrayed as a mad man in some  parts of the film.  He was drove to madness with the lose of loved ones.  Wallace is a very intelligent man with a wisdom the enemies could never compete with. This is a very excellent movie.  If you can withstand the dramatic portion of the movie that includes the bloody scenes.   Mel Gibson did not only star in the movie he also, directed the movie.<BR>I give Braveheart a 5 star rating,  because it is a well put together movie with a love story with in itself.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This CD is a must-have for anyone who enjoys alternative music. It sounds new and fresh, the lyrics go so well with the music behind it. It makes you think, is philosophical and is easy to understand all at the same time. Jared Leto is an amazing vocalist, and the guitars and drums compliment his voice.<BR>Every song is so amazing; you can only appreciate the band with each new track. It makes you wonder why it took them so long to get a record deal! <BR>I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it, this is the best CD in my 100+ CD collection. No joke... buy it, and you'll see. The clips give you a great idea of what is to come.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|OK....the fact that any parallel at all can be drawn between DT and nu-metal is a little bit disturbing.  After listening to ToT for a couple of days, I agree that DT pulls it off really well (of course).  And I may sound a little selfish by saying this, but this was not the album I wanted to hear DT make at this point in their career.  There is very little continuity between the songs on the album and the band sounds like they are trying to be heavy solely for the sake of being heavy.  The melody on past DT albums has been replaced with agression and anger... and the emotional aspect of the music has gone straight out the window.  I'm a little afraid that DT will never again produce songs in the same vein with Another Day, Lines in the Sand, or the Spitit Carries on ever again.  The inspired song writing seems to be lacking on ToT.  The 2 bright spots are In the Name of God and Endless Sacrifice.  <br />On a positive note, this is probably the best metal album that has come out in a long time.....I just didnt expect it to come from Dream Theater.
6304493681|5.0|This is for those people who say that this movie did NOT inspire the matrix. Actually it did, it was even said by the creators of the matrix themselves in an issue of TIME magazine. And yeah, the lingo used in the movie may not be very viewer friendly but if one opens their mind a little they should get it at a few times. And the animation, top knotch.
B000002IHU|5.0|I purchased this album on Vinyl back in September at a Used Shop in my area. I saw the shrink wrap cellophane still intact and thought the condition must be pretty good. What I found remarkable was that it was a sealed copy! For those not old enough to remember, Vinyl LP's were hemmed shut via glued cardboard edges. Yup, someone had traded it in without even hearing the record! <br />I'll bet the previous owner was some guy/gal lived near by (A possibility cuz of the original sticker from \\"Strawberries\\" which is a store down the road. Of course the half which says the original price was slit away.) And hopped on the CD Wave to the fullest selling their old vinyl. It's almost a full circle sort of tale cuz someone from the younger era (me;) acquired their possession. <br />My fandom of Ratt began when I picked up a used CDd copy of their greatest hits compilation, \\"Ratt N' Roll 8191\\" in April 2002. <br />I Was so entertained by this band that I wanted to dig deeper and unearth their back catalog for overlooked jewels. So I simultaneously bought this album, \\"The Ratt Ep\\", and 'Reach For The Sky\\" (The latter two I haven't listened to yet). <br />Ratt's label was Atlantic Records, and \\"Invasion Of Your Privacy\\" was the succesor to their first full length LP, \\"Out Of The Cellar\\" and was released in 1985, which was a tremendously exceptional year for the label, Phil Collins megaseller \\"No Jacket Required\\" was all the rage. <br />Ratt as a band never disappointed, and skeptics wondered aloofly if the Triple Platinum success of \\"Out Of The Cellar\\" would toy with the bands heads. Well that didn't happen thank goodness. <br />For the album cover, Ratt continue the trend of using photographs. There's an attractive girl (I normally don't go for blondes but here's an exception) slipping on a pair of socks. It took me a while to notice that there was a Searchlight on in the background and an open door to the lawn, perhaps she isn't aware? Which plays into the title, \\"Invasion OfYour Privacy\\". <br />The Back Cover and Liner Notes are above average. Photography was courtesy of the legendary Neil Zlozower, in fact the back cover photos are wisely arrainged. Each band member gets a snapshot, one is in the shape of a triangle while others are circles, polygons, rectangular shaped. <br />1985-86 was the height of Hair Metal's first phase, and Ratt's wardrobe included Bright Spandex, long overcoats, and their hair was teased up. I think this style was awesome so you won't read any complaints. In fact there was never a Hair Band from 1981-91 with a Dull image. <br />Beau Hill produced the album, I don't think he gets his just due for all the classics he's helmed the boards for. <br />\\"You're In Love\\" gets the album off to a quality start, with a Catchy guitar hook, the lightning sound effects enhance the overall experience for me. The Video was a classic stageshow teamed with classic videoclips. Big Hit. <br />\\"Never Use Love\\" packs a punch with a Sawblade Riff. Bobby Blotzer bashes away behind the kit with an aggresive attitude and the Stephen Pearcy's Squeal amidst the chorus is the best of the whole album. <br />The Other Big Hit was \\"Lay It Down\\". The moderate Tempo and Heavy Riff does a lot for me. The Topic Du Jour is sex and the verses play out like a dialog a guy would say to his girlfriend, with a slowdown spoken word portion. The Backing Bass Line has a \\"Galloping Horse' fell which is sounds familiar if you've listened to Iron Maiden for extended time a la moi. <br />Structurally speaking \\"Give It All\\" is more complicated at first listen. The riff changes 3 times within the first minute. It took me a few listens for the song to \\"Sink In\\". A soaring Lead is coupled by a verse backing which doesn't quite qualify as \\"Chord Bleeding' for guitarists reading. The Solo is memorable, but not because the Bass lets up which is unique in it's own right. <br />\\"Closer To My Heart\\" is an acoustic-flavored tune that surpasses \\"Back For More\\" off the preceding album. The Electric guitar does show up, slashing and burning. The song fades out in faster speed. <br />The Band sound laid-back on \\"Between The Eyes\\" which isn't bad at all. The Song \\"Parades\\" aound given it's careful pace. The Occasional Underlying Rhythm Guitar recalls the chiming of church bells in my opinion, cuz of the manner. <br />After Gong Adventurous routes, the Robbin Crosby/Warren Demartini Twin Guitars and Bass all converge for \\"What You Give Is What You Get\\" each instrument nearly meshes together. The Ferocious chorus buildup sticks with me. <br />\\"Got Me On The Line\\" brings us to the home stretch, Stephen Pearcy can tell a relationship story the way DMX or Francis Ford Coppola Would tell a Crime Story. Yeah that's the lyrical empasis. Juan Croucier's Bass Line improves the already-there Catchy hook. <br />One ASpect of this album desrving of mention is how some tunes immdiately flow into the next one, for instance \\"You Should Know By Now\\". This song should be required music for parties. Every element perpetuates an Uplifting/Good Time atmosphere. The high pitched intro riff, and lyrics such as <BR>\\"Don't you know it's nothin' new/ Don't you get in my way, get in my way\\", followed by a break down section where only the chorus and Drums with a Cowbell tossed in! Get Out the Booze - Seagram's Gin and 151, and hope noone stops the party with Gun Shots ringing out as described on Gangsta Rap albums, this one's a keeper. <br />\\"Dangerous But Worth The Risk\\" - A splendid closer if there ever was one. The Best Part is when Stephen sings \\"I...Know it's True\\". The Steady drive doesn't let up til the very end. <br />I still miss the late great Guitarist Robbin Crosby a lot. He is gone, but not forgotten as his music will forever live on. I recommend \\"Invasion Of Your Privacy\\" wholeheartedly
B00009TB5G|5.0|Just like the extended Fellowship, this is wonderful release, better than the original theatrical version with moments of pure Tolkein wonder in it. The background discs offer amazing insight to the immense labour of love this production took, with so many creative geniuses involved from Peter Jackson, down to the simplest detail of sound production or prop design. Everything was done with a dedication to Tolkien that contributes this epic and wondrous trilogy.<br />The script writers also explain why the character of Farimir was changed and this is one of the most controversial issues in the film vs book dialogue. However, their rationale makes beautiful sense and even though I was not in favour of the change initially, am now convinced that it made the film better. <br />Beautiful, a tribute to the master of middle earth, and a sad commentary that the so called Oscar's voters cannot see fit to salute Peter Jackson for this awesome achievement.<br />Better than the Matrix, more awe inspiring than the original Star Wars sequence, and an absolute no brainer if you are not sure if you want to buy it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|But the Beatles never did release a bad album did they? <BR>I found Let it Be...Naked to be just as wonderful as the original Let it Be. I will not say either is better because each does indeed have its strongpoints. Let it Be has always been considered (well, to me anyway) the Beatles' most beautiful album. Very lyrical and epic and sentimental as well. Nothing like the White Album or Sgt. Pepper, mind you, but still quite incredible (ITS THE BEATLES, DUH!!!!!). <BR>I have listened to each version of the Long and Winding Road and I simply cannot decide which I like better. And I found Across the Universe to be very incredible on THIS album. So, this cd is nice to have as a supplement to your Beatles collection. And, being as it is priced quite reasonably, I see no reason why you should hesitate to buy this.<BR>It is a fascinating and wonderful album that we should all be grateful of having.<BR>And, for those die hard fans of the original Let it Be, dont worry, it is NOT trying to take the place of your original. It is merely supplementing it.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|After cutting his teeth with his own Kurasawa-morphed western, Leone pursued a truely original style by combining stark emotionality, unhurried visuals, minimilist dialogue and distinct recurrent musical undertones.  He succeeded in cobbling the ultimate &quot;horse opera&quot; with this late 60's classic.<br />The two most obvious attributes of this film is Morricone's timeless score, and the brilliant casting of Henry Fonda as a sociopathic &quot;businessman&quot;.  (Leone's left of center view of expoitive capitalism probably resonates more today than ever.)<br />But like other great movies, there is more here than merely the some of its parts.  The story, performances, scenery, editing all come together perfectly for a truely memorable viewing experience.  <br />This long awaited DVD seems flawless and is being offered at a remarkably modest price.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The Stripped down version of Let It Be is here, yet besides the more obvious cleaned up sound, Only a few of these songs have really any radical differences, with mostly weaker results.<br />1. Get Back: the song is still quite good but really the only <BR>difference is the last couple of verses.<br />2. Dig a Pony: again not a very noticable difference to these ears<br />3. For you Blue: is there any difference with this song then on the original album becuase I dont hear it<br />4. The Long and Winding Road: This is where a big difference comes in place. Yes this song has quite a unique and mellow sound without the orcherstration and the little keyboard solo is quite neat to. In fact this song is pretty good but ive still prefer the hated spector version, but this song does work well both ways.<br />4. Two of Us: Very little differences between the two<br />5. Iv'e Got a Feeling: Way inferior to the original due mainly to Paul McCartney weaker vocal delivery.<br />6. One After 909: This one is slightly different but i still prefer the lib version it just sounds more energentic there.<br />7. Dont Let Me Down:  Weaker then the single version, but it this take is interesting none the less.<br />8. I Me Mine: More quiet which adds to its disadvatage, I know this is suppose to be a striped down version but the bombastic production really does work better for this song.<br />9. Across the Universe: Dont we have enough versions of this song as it is. Anyway this song is still beautiful no matter what version, but i still enjoy the more pscychedelic take from the original album to all the versions.<br />10. Let It Be: Defintley more gospel influenced then the others, but the screaming guitar solo form the original is defintly missed here.<br />Final Anaylis: While most people will scream the original Let it Be album was ruined with Phil Spector's production, I can honestly say i think he did a fine job and Let it Be still remains one of my all time favorites. The songs still sound good but, I really dont know how to put it....I quess it just doesnt sound right. On a sidenote those little chatters between songs were a very unique and nice to hear and if you goona rerealese this you could of at least gave us the full versions of Dig It and Maggie Mae. <br />BTW where is the long out of print Let It Be DVD!
B00009TB5G|5.0|like The Fellowship of the Ring special edition before it, this much improved extended version of The Two Towers has me pondering whether or not to see the final installment of the trilogy, The  Return of the King in theaters. i've spent my $ on two edited theater released films, i don't see buying tickets for part 3 when we all know its going to be chopped. i may wait a year for the 4 disc DVD set to be released.  <br />anyway, you can't miss with either SE DVD set. both are infinitely better than the original theatrical releases. worth every penny and stands up well for repeated viewings.  overall a remarkable achievement by Peter Jackson et al.
B00006WKY9|5.0|As a 42 year old Scorpions fan, i've followed the band since 'Lonesome Crow'!  I equally love Michael Schenker, Uli Roth and Matthias Jabs, each bringing their own personal perfection and style to the band.  The Scorpions were undoubtedly seminal in starting and perfecting the 'hard rock' genre, which became 'heavy metal' after the British invasion with bands like Saxon, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest.  But The Scorpions, with bands like Black Sabbath, Mountain, early Zep, and early Rush, did it FIRST!  Let's not forget Hendrix as well.  But I digress.  'Taken By Force', 'Virgin Killer', 'Fly To The Rainbow', and 'In Trance', were the 4 albums that really got me and many other coming of age 70's teens into hard rock, and all 4 still strongly stand the test of time, given the tight quality songwriting, Klaus' soaring and powerful vocals, and Uli Roth's beyond amazing virtuoso guitar forays.  Many metal and hard rock fans don't realize this, but early Scorpions were responsible for popularizing and perfecting hard rock music around the world. This CD remaster sounds unbelievably great, with increased resolution and air between the instruments and Klaus Meine's great voice!  The acoustic guitar parts sound as if they are leaping out of your speakers with improved clarity and presence.  I have VERY revealing high end, high resolution panel type MAGNEPLANAR speakers, and McIntosh equipment, and I have to say, I don't hear any compression, hiss, or other artifacts on this remaster.  If you are a fan of excellent hard rock or metal, this CD is a MUST for your collection!  Long live The Scorpions!

B00005JM02|1.0|A G rating of film implies that it is appropriate for all ages.  This movie includes a scene of Nemo's mother and all of his siblings being killed.  Next, he is captured and his father, who has been too traumatized by his wife's killing to even leave his home, has to find his son and save him before Nemo is killed.  Although this movie is lovely to look at and is funny for adults at times, it is irresponsible to tell parents to show it to their young children.  In addition to the violent death of Nemo's family and his own impending doom, there are other violent and scary images in this movie that young children should not see.  My child told me after the movie that he was very scared.  I am giving this movie one star because it was irresponsibly marketed to young children and their families and given a rating that was inappropriate for the subject matter.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|How could any self respecting rock fan even consider this album? Phil Spectr MADE rock music. His production technique has been the standard for most every artist to follow. Spector is indirectly the entire reason that the Beatles ever made it out of the days of the two and a half minute single. Spector motivated Brian Wilson to create Pet Sounds and that motivated the Beatles to become more creative. When I listen to &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; without Spector's production it's just unimaginable how this could have happened. Spector is probably one of the greatest musical geniuses of the last century...who is Paul McCartney, master of the corny love song, to undermine Spector's genius? If you're a hardcore Beatles fan though I recommend buying this album because it's got great song (even though in my opinion they've all been ruined), but not before you get the original with Spector's production! I ony wish i could give it 0 stars but no such rating exists.
B0000VCZK2|2.0|The tiring thing for those of us who are sick of shelling out money for \\"Directors Cut Special Edition DVD's\\" is when they pull this crap. While Alien Quad. is no doubt glorious and contains every scrap of info ever filmed concerning my favorite sci fi series, i can't help but feeling cheated.  I bought a $100 4-DVD set last year that was packaged like your average collectors item DVD set: nice pseudo-embossed silver-on-black box, and the \\"Directors Cut\\" of Aliens (read: Laser Disc edition)which is my favorite of the 4 movies. Now I am reading in an \\"official\\" PR release for Quad that this is th \\"first time on DVD that Aliens special edition has been released.\\" Bull! Its been out for a couple of years. This repackaging and reselling crap has got to stop! Studios need to release ONE end-all be-all directors cut/special edition/collectors edition and STICK WITH IT!!!!
B000008HZB|5.0|This one has improved with age, as everything Jeff Lynne has ever written. The Wilbury influence is there for sure, specially because George Harrison made contributions in 4 tracks and Tom Petty co-wrote the excellent &quot;Blown Away&quot;. The wonderful ELO sound is also present and perfectly blended with the recently acquired influences. <BR>&quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; could be considered as an introduction to the future sound of ELO. &quot;Zoom&quot; (2001) is even better, but in order to enjoy it, you probably need to listen to &quot;Armchair Theater&quot; first. You will find some of Jeff Lynne's best compositions here: &quot;Every Little Thing&quot;, &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, &quot;Don't Say Goodbye&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;Blown Away&quot;, which is probably the best Petty/Lynne colaboration ever. <BR>This one is a must for all ELO fans and a revelation for the non-converted.
6305513414|5.0|Star Trek: The Original Series Volume 2 presents two episodes aired in 1966:<br />\\"Mudd's Women:\\" In this segment we are introduced to the galaxy's most likeable adversary, Harry Mudd. Mudd brings aboard the Enterprise his \\"cargo\\" -- three beautiful women. There's a surprising drug angle to the story regarding the illegal Venus drug which supposedly enhances the beauty of Mudd's gals (uh, I don't think the need any help -- especially Ruth and Magda). It's interesting to note that this story was one of the three candidates for the (second) pilot; the two others being \\"The Omega Glory\\" and the accepted \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\\" Good choice because otherwise Star Trek wouldn't exist. Anyway, the episode starts to drag a bit in the third act, but other than that it's a fun, enjoyable outing. GRADE: B<br />\\"The Enemy Within:\\" Kirk gets split into two separate versions of himself a la \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\" Watch out for the dark Kirk's bestial expression at the end of the teaser -- it's great! Note the top two items on the dark Kirk's 'things-to-do' list: 1.) Get some booze off of Dr. McCoy and 2.) Go after sexy Yeoman Janice Rand in her red miniskirt. It is revealed that Kirk's command abilities and decisiveness stem from his carnal side, not his spiritual side. Spock theorizes that the 'evil' side of the human psyche, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to our strength. Thus with Kirk's negative side removed from him, the power of command starts to elude him. (Though McCoy rightly points out later that a human being's essential courage stems from his/her 'good' side). Bottom Line: A brilliant and captivating psychological exploration; fails to achieve \\"A+\\" status only because it starts to plod a bit in the second half. GRADE: A
079073639X|2.0|SPHERE is one of those movies that you watch, thinking, how can such a talented actor as Dustin Hoffman find himself in this quixotic, eccentric and ill-conceived movie.  Dustin tries, but cannot pull off this role, as the script offers nowhere to go.  Crichton's novel was equally confusing, but not as blatantly as the film version.  Samuel L. Jackson sleepwalks (again) through a role that could have been pivotal; Sharon Stone does well considering she's not given the opportunity to explore her mental imbalance, and there's no chemistry whatsoever in her scenes with Hoffman.  Peter Coyote needs to stick to voice-overs in commercials; he portrays all his character's emotions on one level--flat.  Director Barry Levinson has crafted some beautiful scenes; the sphere is gorgeous; and some of the action scenes are riveting.  Too bad there's nothing to support this.  With one of Crichton's best novels (Timeline) coming to the screens later this month, I hope Richard Donner and crew breathe a little more life than that deoxygenated in SPHERE.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|They say this is the way it was supposed to be. True or not, this version of LET IT BE is quite nice to listen to. It sound rougher and (sometimes) sweeter. This version of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; is beautiful. They took off the orchestra and left only the piano (which to me feels more intimate). &quot;Get Back&quot; seems to me pretty close to the original (although the vocal presence is much stronger). I loved to see &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; back and another version of &quot;Let It Be&quot;.<br />All in all, this is a very good experience if you already know the original LET IT BE (I don't think this is their best work though). May sound a bit strange if you are not familiar with the Beatles' other works (which are far more elaborate).<br />The only thing I did not quite understand was the second disc... 20 minutes of rehearsing material that does not amount to much. It is nice to hear them chatting... but many of the chats last only a few seconds... and the music they rehearse is... well... simple rehearsal... that's all. I wish that instead of the 20-minute-pasted-fragments they had put real music (alternate versions, instrumentals or other stuff) that could be played... for no one will play this second disc twice.<br />It is a good buy, but far away from the &quot;Anthology&quot; line of work.<br />Anyway, The Beatles are still the greatest thing that ever happened in 20th century popular music.
0783222149|4.0|I liked this movie because it explores:<BR>1) that women can by physically and psychologically strong<BR>2) that women can face challenges such as whether to possibly mistakenly kill a threatening person<BR>3) that men can be strong around women who are strong<BR>4) that the human spirit is resilient and can overcome extreme challenges<br />Plus the nature is great, the acting is excellent and the journey is interesting.
0385504209|1.0|I have never encountered someone who has gone to greater lengths to deny the deity of Christ in order to justify his own misguided morality, or lack thereof.  Under the guise of fiction, Brown would have us believe that Jesus Christ was just a man like any other, but his \\"wife,\\" is someone to be worshipped.  Why should she be worshipped?  Because she's the woman who was married to Jesus, who wasn't divine.  However, Jesus had [intercourse] with her,...so when he joined with this woman, he was able to see God.  That's it!  All men, except men like his hero (a.k.a. Dan Brown), are unenlightened and/or evil; Women are divine.<br />I'm sure that while Mr. Brown is raking in the dough, he thinks he's helping those women whom he thinks are uptight, endoctrinated, oppressed, and Christian, but most Christian women I know don't need his manly powers.  Actually, most of us feel loved--by our friends, our families, and our God.  Furthermore, some of us resent Brown's exploitation of women who do feel endoctrinated and oppressed, women who feel they should be honored above others simply on the basis of gender.  Isn't Brown fostering sexual discrimination against his own sex so that he can sell books primarily to women?<br />Put all that beside poorly drawn characters, a weak plot, superficial theological research, and abundant anti-Christian rhetoric and you've got one, very human, feminine thumb down.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|I'm listening to &quot;County Fair&quot; as I type this review.  I have been a Bruce fan for 20+ years and I never cease to be amazed how he can capture real life in his music.  I find his latest CD (&quot;The Rising&quot;) particularly moving, especially the song &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot;.  Anyone who is a Bruce fan, new or old, will LOVE the &quot;Essential&quot; CD!!!
B00005JMJ5|3.0|When I was watching the Human Stain, I felt like I was watching two movies. The first was the story of a justifiably bitter man redeemed by an unlikely love affair, who must protect his lover from her unstable ex. The second, and far more compelling, was of a young man in the 1940s who makes a fateful choice that will affect the rest of his life. Anthony Hopkins is excellent, as usual, and it's easy to imagine him having been a boxer in his youth-- he seems to bring a sense of pugnaciousness to most of his roles. Nicole Kidman is another matter. She's simply too glamorous to be believable as this beaten down and (in the novel) illiterate woman. <BR>     The other of half of the story is much more interesting and features an outstanding performance by Wentworth Miller as the young Coleman Silk. These scenes crackle with the energy of a young man and a country teetering on the edge of unimaginable upheaval. Anna Deveare Smith is also very good as Coleman's mother. For some reason, I never believed that Miller and Hopkins were the same person, and it seemed ludicrous that Coleman would reach late middle age without revealing his secret. (Couldn't he have done so in the '60s?) ....<BR>     Ed Harris is reliably good as Kidman's ex, but again it's hard to imagine his and Kidman's characters being married. A good try.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is fine straight up. Shes defientely got that BOOM BOOM. Plus 'Toxic' is pretty tight and i wish i could do Britney's touching for her in 'Touch of My Hand'.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Now for those that got familiar with kj's art through his solo marathon albums might get really surprised. This album is made for your OWN personal time with a glass of scotch near the fireplace.....peacefull, intimate, slow (some said he got tired, but for me he is close to koln concert in performane although in totally different background)....this is the perfect gift to someone you care about. All the notes are clear and here comes the moto &quot;less is more&quot;.....listen to it again and again. Soon it will get under your skin and you'll come back to it every time you are lookin for peace.
B000002GDJ|3.0|I'll give the Police credit for being an engaging listen. The rhythms that this band generates certainly causes me to pay attention. There are some reggae and jazz influences with some definite rock n roll energy.<br />However as far as the songs go on Regatta De Blanc, there are some good tunes and others which are pretty forgettable. Message In A Bottle and Its Allright For You are captivating rock n roll tunes. However the title track just seems like an introductory filler piece with little in the form of meaningful lyrics. On Any Other Day is a humous tune and Bring On The Night is fine foray into jazz. However Walking On The Moon and The Beds Too Big Without You can stray on the nerves due to Sting's whiny vocals and a meandering melody line.<br />The remaining tunes are OK but certainly not fabulous. Truthfully I find Outlandos D'Amour much more energetic. Three stars is the right verdict here.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|First we get Vapor Trails, which probably has the worst sound quality of any studio album on the planet, then we get Rush in Rio, which is probably the worst sounding live album on the planet.<br />With this trend, what exactly do we have to look forward to?
0792164903|5.0|This version of Sleepy Hollow is much better than the original plus......JOHNNY DEPP IS SOOOO YUMMY!!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I watched this movie this week after having made the midnight run to get it.  The extended and added scenes make the move 100x better than it was to begin with!  It is fast moving up my list of favorite movies of all time.  Both extended editions add details to the story that get lost in the theatrical releases.  Well worth owning.  Because of the bonus material on the disks, my wife and I are eagerly awaiting the release of 'The Return of the King'
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This was my first britney cd that i have ever bought. I didnt know wheter to buy it or not. For all I know this could be a total disapointment. But im so glad i bought it. its a great album. its mainly a dance cd, but it also explores life. It shows you how britney is living and changing. Shes saying in this cd that she is going to be who she wants to be. The only dissapointment i''ve had with this cd and the reason it got four stars and not five is because there are simply not enough ballads in it. i wish she would show the world how much she could really sing. there are some hints of  a great voice but not enough. if there were just one powerful ballad it would have been so great. i like how she is going towards a more urban angle of music...but maybe its just to sell records because thats whats hot right now. i recomend you go and buy this cd because it is a great one...atleast your sing along and bop your head alot.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I am going to keep this review short and simple... great album!
B000024D4R|5.0|This album is no doubt my favorite Pink floyd record yet. Dogs, in my opinion is the greatest song Roger Waters ever wrote. I'm not a definate Pink Floyd fanatic, but I do know good, oh sorry great music when I hear it and this is it. As am writing this review I'm listening to Pigs(three different ones) and I'm listening to it and I think of how can someone write this music? Next is sheep, this probobly my 3rd least favorite, because it just dosn't have the flare that Dogs and Pigs have. Almost all the songs clock into over 13 minutes long. The only exeptions are Pigs on the wing 1 and 2. These are only 1:25 minutes long and are just Roger Waters playing his acoustic guitar and singing. Dogs is my favorite track on the album at 17 minutes long and it has 4 guitar solos and the lyrics are wonderful. All in all it is a great album and if you love Pink Floyd get it, and if you're not then get it anyway because it is a great way to introduce Pink Floyd to you.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I must admit, for the longest time I had dismissed SOAD as yet another byproduct of disgusting &quot;NuMetal&quot;. Having been forged on bands like Slayer, (Real) Metallica, Pantera, Sepultura, Biohazard, and with a strong streak of (Real) Punk to boot, I found what the late 90s was doing to metal to be revolting. That is, until I heard &quot;Steal This Album&quot;. It prooved to me that SOAD was not another Limp Bizquick type band.<br />As with every review I have read, this album is not just a lame B-Side/Outtake album. Standout songs (for me at least) include &quot;I-E-A-I-A-I-O&quot;, &quot;Ego Brain&quot;, &quot;Roulette&quot; and of course my favorite, &quot;Mr. Jack&quot;.<br />This album is obviously a must for any SOAD fan, but can be quite helpful reeling in those who haven't been indoctronated into the SOAD universe. I also strongly suggest picking up a copy of the Dracula 2000 soundtrack to hear their cover of &quot;The Metro&quot;. The original song sucked, but SOAD has turned it into on my of top 5 songs of all time.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As you can see from the positive ratings (at this point in time, 35 reviews, all 5 stars!), this is the perfect dvd for George fans.<br />I had my doubts at first. I am not a fan of Jeff Lynne, and not that big a fan of Clapton. And some of these other people: Sam Brown? Joe Brown? Who the hell are they?<br />Well, they're all friends of George! And, as it turns out, all amazing singers and musicians!<br />And Clapton and Lynne to excellent jobs of performing and of supervising this show!<br />Even the Indian music in the beginning of the full concert is great!<br />I originally saw the theatrical release and knew I would buy the dvd when it came out. But the fact that it comes out with TWO dvd's - one of the theatrical release - and one of the FULL concert, is more than I could have hoped for!<br />All I can say is, this is probably the best &quot;Tribute&quot; performance that was ever given anyone; the love just shines through from every performer! And the director of the video, and Jeff Lynne's production of the audio is equally fantastic!<br />If you are a Beatles fan, you MUST have this dvd. You will cherish it! If you maybe weren't that big a fan of George, this is likely to turn you on to his music!<br />Really I could have just said just one word in this review:<br />BEAUTFIFUL!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|There is not a single bad song on this CD.  A great follow-up to Silver Side Up.  The best songs are: Someday (Of Course!), Do This Anymore, Feelin Way Too Damn Good, and See You at The Show.  I reccomend it to anyone!
B00005JMF6|3.0|I saw this movie  the Friday that it opened.    I had   a little knowledge about the movie and decided to go see it with my wife. She said it was a psychological thriller which is what she  likes.   I wasn't sure what to expect.   It is a thriller and the music in parts   can get you geared up for the unexpected scream for  something   seemingly suspenseful but leaving you  just relaxing  because nothing happened. THere  are a few parts  where there are graphic scenes of blood as well as  sudden images. It was during those times that the girls in the theatre  screamed in unison and you could only laughed. My  wife practically jumped in my lap.    I was able to figure out the story as it unfolded.Overall, I wouldn't go see it again.  Halle Berry    didn't pick a good movie to   perform in. Neither  of the actors did unless they are looking for work.  No awards here.  If you  just like to figure  out who done it   in mysteries you would like that part of it. If you want to hang on your seats and  then there are suspenseful parts that  happen very quickly, enough to make girls scream loudly anyway.  2 out of 5 stars
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this album is different than britney's others...thank god.  i used to be &quot;one of those&quot; people...against britney and the crap music she had.  at least now she isn't trying to pretend to be good and she doesn't muddle down her albums with poor excuses for ballads.  she knows what she's good at (ie, dancing to good beats)...she is a performer, not a singer.  and this cd shows she finally accepts that.  the beats are awesome.  don't listen to it expecting to be enlightened by deep lyrics and music that sees into your soul...this isn't the cd.  it's fun...we all need some of that once in a while.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I was very disapointed with this release because it really contains nothing new consitering there is about 300 hours of tape to these sessions.The album is only 34 minutes long and all the talking has been takin off so it doesn,t seem like a live in studio recording I perfer the Spectorized album better. The 2nd disc is utterly worthless its just some talking and short rehersal songs.They had a chance to make this a great package full of extras but they blew it. Please do not buy this product itis a waste of money. Also I see why it was only $11.00
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I was never a great fan of the original Let It Be, but rediscovered this album with this release.<br />While I agree that this by no means is an \\"original\\" version, because as mentioned elsewhere the artist wasn't really involved in any of the mixes, it is great to hear the Beatles without all the fluff. A couple of guitars, piano, bass and drums and the result some pretty cool songs.<br />It sort of reminds me of some of the Stones re-issues on hybrid SACD and hopefully one day the Beatles catalogue will be reissued in that format.
B000092ZYX|5.0|When I first purchased this record I promptly popped it into my cd player for a spin. My first thought was this is terrible, either I'm in the wrong mood or its the wrong kind of music. I had heard Ok Computer prior to this release and thoroughly enjoyed it so I heard Radiohead had a new album out that was all the rage so I decided I had $15 why not? So I shelfed the cd and then decided to try it again a few days later, with the same reaction. This continued to be the case until about a month and a half later when I was tired of the new Black Rebel Motorcycle Club cd and I couldnt decide what to listen to and then I happened to see this hidden admist my dozens of cds and I thought sure, I'll try it again. And this time it actually was pretty good! Soon, needless to say, I loved this record and thought Radiohead had made another masterpiece, which they have. This is in the same vein as Kid A except it also has little dashes of Ok Computer in it. Most of the songs leave you with a cold, removed feeling, as if they were meant to listen to while looking out a window at snow falling down on everything. Which isnt a bad feeling, dont get me wrong, but its definitley a different one. I would definitley classify this as a &quot;winter&quot; record(I dont know why but I divide a lot of my cds into this kind of classification system)because of the cold feeling that dominates it. Its a very good album though, and I feel that Radiohead definitley knew what they were doing when they released it. The only problem I forsee is the lack of variety but thats ok because the music that is on here is plenty good enough as it is. I highly reccomend this to those who like Kid A and Ok Computer, and if your new to Radiohead than listen to the samples first and then judge from that.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|What can you say about The Jethro Tull Christmas Album? Well, like a vintage bottle of fine wine, the latest Tull offering does not disappoint. Let's start with the CD cover - a whimsical scene of an English village at the Winter Solstice - complete with the famously-balanced flute player himself serenading a herd of sheep. A Currier &amp; Ives-like lithograph that seems to harken back to simpler times. It made me wish for the artwork of the dim and distant past...the 1970's record album cover. The seventies were, of course, the definitive Tull heyday, and so old and new blend together in a juxtapositional blend of past glories, recent reworkings, and up-to-the-present playing. Tull antiquities from earlier albums like &quot;Fire at Midnight&quot;, &quot;Weathercock&quot;, and &quot;Ring Out Solstice Bells&quot; are dusted down, re-recorded and re-mixed in royal fashion with the addition of mandolins, tambourines, whistles, and Ian Anderson's stellar flute playing. Traditional Christmas Carols, &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, and &quot;Greensleeved&quot; are likewise infused with Tull feeling. Fine playing from excellent musicians (the current Jethro Tull lineup of Ian, Martin Barre, Doane Perry, Andrew Giddings, and Jonathon Noyce) combined with studio musicans, and a couple of old and new friends, give this recording an overall zest and feeling of close comradeship that warms the cockles. And finally, Ian Anderson proves that he can still spin a tale worth singing about in the new tunes provided on this disc. The lovely song &quot;First Snow On Brooklyn&quot; paints a picture steeped in the sadness of winter's chill, while in contrast, &quot;Last Man At The Party&quot; is reminiscent of the best of Ian Anderson's famous wit and tongue-in-cheek sense of humor. But best of all, the instrumental tunes sparkle and shine. In particular the final tune, &quot;A Winter Snowscape&quot; is as beautiful a song as I have ever heard Tull play, and Ian Anderson's flute playing is better than ever. He just seems to get better with age. The Jethro Tull Christmas Album washes over the listener like a river of good will. In these cynical and troubled times, what a blessing! So put this disc on the player, light a roaring fire, and pour yourself a cup o' good cheer that is sure to last all year long. Season's Greetings!
B000000OQF|5.0|This great album came out just a few years prior to the big grunge explosion but it still had plenty of time for its own big splash. This band practically craved the limelight and Axl Rose has got to be one of the best frontmen ever, the man has an ego the size of a semi and is crazy as hell, sure that shot the band to pieces but he was model for what a crazy leadsinger should be like! The cuts off of this album are pure 100% rock, no strings attached, no gimmicks just straight up balls to the walls rock. GN'R were never afraid though to inject a sweet ballad or two into their playlist(look at Sweet Child O'Mine and Think About You)and they also weren't afraid to flash their humorous side with tracks like My Michelle and Out Ta Get Me which I do hope was a joke because the lyrics sure ooze with paranoia. Slash shows his excellent guitars manship with screeching, crooning and distorted guitars scattered all through out the songs. And Axl never takes a break from his vocal gymnastics from high falsettos to low growls(along with a few hair raising screams).This record has already cemented its place in rock history as one of the great masterpieces and with very good reason. Not only did it have a mass appeal but it also wasnt watered down, a nice, perfect balance. Now if only Axl could get his act together and a band also to release a new album(which I hear has been in the making for years!)and hopefully return to his rock greatness!
B000127LW2|4.0|I was a huge fan of Voyager in its early years, and this DVD will allow me to re-experience the show's stellar first year. Although it wasn't the show's best, this season (and the show) was a meat-and-potatoes kind of Star Trek that succeeded on its own winsome enthusiasm for the first few years. The show's first season contains good acting and writing, great science-fiction, and introduced some rather long-lived story arcs.<br />Voyager inherited a writing staff from The Next Generation including Trek sci-fi maestro Brannon Braga and heartstring-tugging Jeri Taylor. Along with an impeccably-cast set of talented actors, the show's direction seemed assured from early on. The pilot, \\"Caretaker,\\" was a spectacular episode: it introduced the central premise of the show, the relationships between the characters, and some of the initial story arcs. Although the first season was a bit light on character exposition, the characters were portrayed intriguingly. The standout here were scene-stealers Robert Picardo and Robert Duncan McNeill as the Doctor and Tom Paris, who got all the show's best lines. McNeill, especially, is perfect as Paris, a mixture of R.P. McMurphy, Marlon Brando, and Ro Laren. The other standout is Martha Hackett as Seska, the Maquis-turned-Starfleet who was a Cardassian spy all along and defects to the Kazon. Hackett plays her with such palpable malevolence, it's just fun to watch. The other characters, though, got their share of time as well.<br />Voyager did a few things well throughout the years, and one of them was that it always had great sci-fi stories. \\"Eye of the Needle\\", for example, was a neat high-concept episode and mystery rolled into one. Other shows, such as \\"Emanations\\" and \\"Cathexis\\" were more science-fiction-metaphysical-type stories dealing with, primarily, death. Not to mention the time-travel mystery \\"Time and Again\\" and the fantastic \\"Ex Post Facto\\", where Tom Paris is accused of murder. This season really focused on the science-fiction and delivered splendidly.<br />It was here that we got some rewarding story arcs. The Kazon were the show's bad boys for a time, and they are explored in a few episodes here, culminating with Seska's defection in \\"State of Flux\\". The Vidiians were introduced in \\"Phage\\" and were a very interesting concept -- a species whose perpetuation requires extensive organ harvesting. Both aliens would feature prominently in the first three years, and sporadically throughout. There was also the tension between the Maquis and Federation crews, which provided constant drama here.<br />In short, the roots of the show were very impressive indeed. Not only were the writing and acting great, as well as the science-fiction stories, the show served an important function in setting the proverbial table for the seasons that followed. My complaint is that a hundred bucks seems a bit exorbitant, considering that other sets with a full season command the same price, and this one only has half that. Nevertheless, the show took off here with promise.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This record in my opinon will soon be in the same league as Led Zepplin IV and Black Sabbath's Paraniod. Its a masterpiece, quite simply put, one of the only true masterpiece's this generation has produced as a matter of fact. Jack White wails on the guitar, churning out bluesy riffs and screeching solos. Meg White is also here banging her drumset into oblivion, and also displaying her vocal abilities too(which on all previous efforts she hasnt)and they are quite good. The album's opener &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; has become a mainstream radio hit, with its pulsing bass lines and steady drum beats that seem to cement themselves into your subconscious. Its followed up with a grungy howling rocker &quot;Black Math&quot; and then the whining squeling &quot;There's No Home For You&quot;. After that the album slows a bit with a cover song of &quot;I Just Dont Know What To Do With Myself&quot; which has a very nice stop-start rythm. Then there is the Meg White ballad &quot;In the Cold, Cold Nigh&quot; which Meg croons out very gently. In my opinion the next two songs &quot;I Want to Be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart&quot; and &quot;You've Got Her in Your Pocket&quot; are the weakest tracks which are both slow and slightly dull. Maybe that is good because it makes the next song &quot;Ball And Biscuit&quot; even better. This is the highlight of the album, eight minutes of wailing, blues rock(I wonder if you can guess what the song is about)in which Jack display is AWESOME guitar talents. Then comes &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot; which is the new single off this album and its not too bad but definitley not that great either, a solid song. &quot;Little Acorns&quot; is a fuzzed-out rocker that is what it would be like if Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin played a song together. &quot;Hypnotize&quot; is a punk song with a very fast beat, and its the most upeat song on the album a definite A+. &quot;The Air Near My Fingers&quot; is simply great, I love listening toit, its a perfect song, not too loud but not too soft. &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine&quot; is another punk rock cut and its just as great as &quot;Hypnotize&quot;. Then we have the last song &quot;Well Its True That We Love One Another&quot; a light hearted 3 way duet between Jack White, Meg White and guest singer Holly Golightly. This is a great rock record for those of you who like pure rock and not that nu-metal or pop punk manufactuted mess. A great breath of fresh air and a monumental piece of rock!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I got into the Zone ever since the first day it came out and the chain stores were sold out by mid day. The songs on this album is very good. Britney has shown that she IS the queen of pop. She is amazing and shock us with every new album. This CD will be in my CD player for a very song time. My Favorites are &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; &quot;Boom Boom&quot; &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; &quot;Toxic&quot; &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; &quot;The Hook Up&quot; &quot;Brave New Girl &quot;Everytime&quot; This album was definitely worth the 2 year wait. Everyone should buy it and experience the ZONE!
B00006AW2M|5.0|This is my favorite Stones album b/c mainly its psychedelic and that is one of my favorite genres of music and this album has psychedelic written all over it(just look at the cover of the cd and the case if you dont believe me)and its just an all out great record. I think the Stones were trying to make their own Sgt.Pepper with this release but who can fault them for that, I mean Pepper is one helluva great album and at the time it was released(and even now)it was revolutionary so naturally the Stones were gonna want to release a record to rival Pepper. Personally though, I dont think the Beatles were half as good with psychedelia as Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd were and their album &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; was the REAL masterpiece of psychedelic music and this is the perfect companion piece to that album I think. Obviously I'm not the only one to think this because two or three other people already have reccomended &quot;Piper&quot; in addition to this. I think this album and Piper are lightyears ahead of Pepper in terms of style, substance and mind blowing quality. This is a lot more &quot;out there&quot; than Pepper is and its definitley a lot more crazier. Track number five is basically one long psychedelic jam and tracks 2 and 3 are great short psychedelic pieces. Anyways this cd is great so buy it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Don't believe ppl who say this album is rubbish, because it takes time to grow on you. At first I kind of thought some of the songs were a bit slow, but once listened to it over and over again the more depth and meaning it had, and now I absolutely love every single track on this album. Hardcore guitar in tracks like Losing Grip and Sk8er Boi, and softer melodies like Tomorrow and Naked will have you following Avril every step of the way. It's a great album, so don't miss out!
B00000295Y|5.0|I dont really listen to rap, but then again their are exceptions to every rule and in my book this is my exception. I first listened to Insane in the Membrane when I was about 5 and then I heard it again last year when my uncle was blasting this cd so I took it upon myself to listen to it and find out what it was all about. Soon I had this cd and I listen to it every now and then(its the perfect cd to listen to when playing Grand Theft Auto)and I have to say its one of the only records that &quot;rap&quot; in general has yielded that I can say I enjoy. That in itself is a big accomplishment, because I mostly think rap and crap rythme for a very good reason. Anyways if you like rap or anything with funny lyrics with some pretty nice beats along side them than this is a good pick!
B000094DUP|5.0|Innocent Eyes is by far one of the best albums ever recorded. Delta has such soul and passion and the voice of an angel, and all these things just give you all the more reason to purchase this amazing CD. She has a wonderful voice, and all her songs are catchy and tear-jerking. I especially like Predictable which is one of her rockier songs, This is Not Me, Running Away and Butterfly which are heart-wrenching and will get you singing along in no time. If you're a ballad lover, do NOT miss out on this CD, and if you're not, give it a listen anyway, coz I sure wasn't a ballad lover until I heard this album.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|The Beatles argued about this album in the beginning now Paul's got two of them out of the way, he can release HIS Let It Be. It's only OK! I wonder what John and George would say about this release?
0385504209|5.0|I did not want to put this book down.  For four day's, when ever I had a minute, this book was in my hand.  It makes you think, it makes you wonder.  Is it all possible?  Could all of this be true?<br />I first heard of this book on the special that ABC did.  I was born and raised Catholic.  Raised to believe what my parents, grandmother and church taught me was the truth.  I'm still Catholic but I am old enough now to question things.  Doesn't make me a bad catholic, just an inqusitive one.  I never knew that Mary Magdalen was considered the holy grail. Not until the ABC special, did I even hear of the posibility.<br />The book mixes historical &quot;fact/folklore&quot; w/ intrigue, deception and murder.  It keeps you on your toes, trying to figure out the little clues before you get to the answers, and trying to figure out what's going to happen, before it even does.<br />The mark of an amazing book, is when more than one person in your household wants to read it, and can't put it down when they are.<br />Not only a must read, but a must have!
B00005JMFR|4.0|You know how it is.You've just found out you're not mankinds saviour, but you can bring down sentinals out of that dream world thing you're trying to stop and then youre stuck somewhere between it and the real world. Or maybe you dont.<br />Well, Neo (Keanu Reeves)finds out about it. that is the start of the \\"final\\" film of the Wachowski Brothers mind-blowing science fiction trilogy.<br />What follows the start is a fantastic gravity defying battle between the Marivingions thugs and Morphius, Trinity and Seraph, a veryconfusing chat with the Oricle, and a attack on zion scene that beats everything from the sequel (even THAT car chase).<br />It can be safely said that the first hour and a half is the most fun I've had in the cinema since \\"Pirates of the Caribean\\" or \\"the Two Towers\\". It certainly beats Reloaded.<br />So with a heavy heart I will explain why it lost a star. The end fight between Smith and Neo was the biggest anti-climax in cinema history, and the end was so unbelievable it made the end of Reloaded look like a genuis' work.<br />I would put money on the end being changed by Warner for the possibility of another sequel. The Wachowski COULD not have wrote this end.<br />By all means see it, but true fans beware, you will be angry.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I bought this CD today, compeled maybe by having the latest Dream Theater album to complete my collection. What I got was a refreshing and unexpected experience. Technically this album is on par with the other ones. I cannot say this one is better than Awake or Images and Words, etc. What i can say is that this album has more substance, once you look beyond the technical wisdom that this guys posses when they play their instruments. James LaBrie has more control of his voice, and it shows. He can still go &quot;high&quot; but the tone of this album is more &quot;deep&quot;. John Meyung's bass has taken a front row in this production and it clearly shows what damage the guy can do. <br />In all, this is an album that has more feeling and a consistent tone. Clearly I would recommend this album over anything out there because quite frankly, there is nothing outside Dream Theater to compare it with.
B00004YX0R|5.0|I agree with the 4 earlier reviewers.  I've listened to a number of other highly regarded performances, including those from the Italian, Emerson, and Lindsays, and the Talich Quartet are the best hands down.  I think that it's possible to get a feel for some of the best performances by reading reviews, but the only way to find the best performance for you is to listen to them yourself. The samples on Amazon do help in that regard, and still better is to be able to sample longer passages at a book or music store, etc.  You can hear extended excerpts from the Emerson String Quartet at the NPR Performance Today website.  According to the experts at NPR, the Emerson are supposed to be the best, but for my 2 cents they are way too rushed, and the Talich blows them away.  But do your own due diligence.
6305972591|2.0|This movie has the kind of plot that could scare the pants off you. A teen zealot is contacted by an evil spirit, pieces together a cult in his hometown, convinces his peer group to kill all the adults in town, then carries out murders and sacrifices to appease \\"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\\". I was scared just from the commercials when I was 14. I watched it last night, and it's about as scary as an episode of Friends.<br />The \\"outlanders\\" ruin everything. They are so unmoved by the bizarre situation, it's very difficult to be scared yourself. They hit a boy in the road with a Buick LeSabre, the woman is captured by the kids and crucified, the guy is stabbed in the chest, they confront a supernatural entity, witness a sacrifice & subsequent possession, and set acres of cornfields aflame by pushing gasohol through the irrigation pumps. All the while, they barely hit their target heartrate. They're running around town after someone corns up their car (which has the body of the boy in the trunk), constantly encountering horrible situations. Again, they don't even really break a sweat. At the end of the movie, it's like a sequel to that sled dog movie. They're all giddy talking about adopting the two youngsters who help them out. Even then, a psycho from the church springs from their back seat with a knife. After slamming her across the nose with the car door, they just start laughing again and decide to walk to the next town and adopt the kids.<br />The best actor in this movie is easily the kid who plays Malachai. He's so evil, it's awesome. That red hair, the bellbottom floods, the teeth, and a voice that sounds like barbed wire. He wants the blood of the outlanders, he overthrows Isaac, he carries a kitchen knife in a hip holster. He's who tormented me in my dreams when I was a kid. <br />Big ups to Malachai!
B0000TB05A|5.0|For the past 2 years the Elevation DVD has been the music DVD standard in my mind, the one against which all others are measured.  In my view, only Nine Inch Nail's &quot;And all that could have been&quot; has ever lived up to that disc.  <br />And now this comes out.<br />So me and my girlfriend are big U2 fans, and have heard seemingly every version of all of their songs.  Some of the songs from this concert are my new favorite versions.  Angel of Harlem has never swung so much, Sunday Bloody Sunday has never sounded so... hopeful.<br />You definately want this one.
B00008WG3U|4.0|Well... Let me tell you what i thought about the songs.<br />01. The Separation Of Church And Skate: 10/10<BR>02. The Irrationality Of Rationality: 9/10<BR>03. Franco Un-American: 9/10<BR>04. Idiots Are Taking Over: 8/10<BR>05. She's Nubs: 9/10<BR>06. Mattersville: 8/10<BR>07. Decom-posuer: 5/10<BR>08. Medio-Core: 5/10<BR>09. Anarchy Camp: 6/10<BR>10. American Errorist(I Hate Hate Haters): 8/10<BR>11. We Got Two Jealous Agains: 7/10<BR>12. 13 Stiches: 8/10<BR>13. Re-gaining Unconsciousness: 6/10 <BR>14. Whoops, I OD'd: 7/10<br />Well all i have to say as that the first 6 songs were pretty good but then 7,8,9 were kind of boring especially tracks 7 and 8. Then the rest of the songs were good but not as good as the first 6 songs on the cd. Overall the cd started out great, got kind of boring, then got a little better.<br />  Total: 7.5<br />Although it had some videos on this cd which i enjoyed.<BR>So buy this cd if your into this band, but this cd isnt great but its got some pretty decent stuff and the videos are cool.
0790729385|5.0|I read the book right after it came out and I couldn't put it down!  When the movie came out I already heard a lot of the advance publicity but I was still deeply engrossed when I watched it for the first time.  I have seen it many times since although not in its' recent remastered version.  It is a movie that will challenge you in many ways yet it is also a movie that has the potential to reassure you are well.  It is a very well-made movie complete with great writing, acting, directing, and, above all, great special effects.  Even after all of these years, they still are impressive.  <br />This movie is not for the squeemish as I can illustrate with an experience I had in Ensenada, Mexico.  The movie had been out for a year or two and a friend of mine and I were traveling in Baja Mexico.  There wasn't a lot to do at night so, when I saw that the movie was playing at the local theatre, I suggested we go see it.  When my friend said he hadn't seen it before, I insisted that we go.  The theatre was fairly full when we went in.  As the movie got progressively more intense, the show would stop and a warning notice would appear on the screen advising the viewers that the movie was going to become even more graphic.  This screen appeared three times during the movie.  At the end of the show, the lights came on and I was surprized to discover that there were only a handful of people besides my friend and I who had sat through the whole movie.  <br />I don't know that the movie will grip you quite so hard but it may.  There is a strong element of hardcore Christian good versus demonic evil and you can get caught up in this.  The actual history of exorcism is fairly scant given the number of years the scarement has been around and the hundreds of millions of Christians that were or are in this world.  I suspect most people would view this movie more as a test of their nerves rather than their faith.  However, after my experience in Mexico, I thought I should at least put myown warning notice on the screen.
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine Dion, one of my all-time favorite music artists, is a wonderful musician and has an extraordinary singing voice.  Her music has always been a soothing, relaxing sanctuary for me.  When I've had a tough day or am in a bad mood, I can turn on any one of Dion's CD's and I know it is sure to help me relax and unwind.  Celine Dion's soft, sweet voice combined with the deep and passionate words that express love and tenderness are a <BR>combination that is sure to move you.<br /><BR>One of my favorite albums by Celine Dion, although they are all equally great, is titled \\"Falling into You\\".  This CD, which contains some of Celine Dion's best written love ballads, sung with feeling and dedication is a CD I can not get enough of.  It is no wonder this CD recieved a grammy award and has reached platinum status in sales.<br /><BR>This CD contains the hits \\"Because you Loved Me\\", \\"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\\", and \\"Falling Into You\\", three great songs, well written and sung wonderfully.  The hit \\"Because You Loved Me\\", sung so energetically by Celine Dion is a beautiful love song which words go beyond the meaning of love.  The song, \\"It's all Coming Back to Me Now\\", is a heartfelt, deep song that will take you back to previous love affairs.  \\"Falling Into You\\" is another great song that touches you so deep inside that your emotions will overflow and make you feel many different feelings.  These three songs are only a sampling of just one of Celine Dion's great albums.<br />The above songs are only three great tracks on this CD.  \\"Seduces Me\\", \\"All By Myself\\", and \\"Call The Man\\" are three more great examples of Celine's Dion's amazing talent.  These and the entire CD portray some of Celine Dion's greatest singing abilities that have never disappointed me.<br /><BR>Celine Dion is one of my favorite artists.  There has never been a song nor album by Celine Dion that has not moved me or made me feel like I am in another world.  Her songs are meaningful, heartfelt and hervoice is filled with emotion when she is singing.  I know I can always expect great songs from Celine Dion.
B00005JMFR|4.0|Okay, i am a die hard Matrix fan so some of you may not agree with my views. Although i think most of the trilogy is explained in the first movie, i disagree that it is the best. Reloaded had excellent fight scenes and an awesome car chase. Revolutions is such an awesome ending. It did not let me down, as i was shaking in my seat. The ending to me was a bit of a surprise, and as Reloaded, it ended in sort of a cliffhanger. I say, go see it, it is worth it. I would have payed $20.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I've been a Rush fan for 20 years now an I love these CDs.  I know nothing about how sound is mixed or anything like that.  All I know is that these CDs sound great in my car on the way to work every morning.  It's like being at the show all over again.  It is a great collection of music from a great band.
B00000DFUN|5.0|Intimate, complex, emotional, fun, exquisite musicianship ... Anouar Brahem has it all. Also check out Astrakan Caf and Barzakh, two equally satisfying albums - less jazzy, more arabian music.
B0000TB050|4.0|Well, at the time when I ordered this, Amazon.com couldn't really confirm if there were indeed two versions: one packaged in a CD jewel case, and one packaged in the usual DVD format.  They had them listed with the exact same product description, contents, etc.  I called them, and they told me they probably made a clerical error, and that the items were identical, just different in price.  Turns out now that they've re-listed one as a Limited Deluxe Edition.<br />However, from what I can tell, the contents inside are identical to each other, with the only difference being the packaging, and that the CD jewel case version is about $5 cheaper.<br />The packaging claims that there are English, French, Spanish, German, and Brazilian Portugese subtitles on the DVD, but I couldn't activate them...I've had no problems with other DVDs with subtitles in the same player, so either the subtitles don't exist, or the disc may not have been mastered properly.<br />I did get the impression that this disc was thrown together in a bit of a hurry, most likely the record companies wanting to cash in for Christmas.  I find it ludicrous that they would charge an extra $5 for DVD-style packaging.  It's nothing more than a cash grab.<br />Bottom line is that if you're a die-hard U2 collector, you'll want this for your collection, but it'll probably wind up alongside the Popmart album also collecting dust.  The Boston DVD still takes the prize for the best production to date.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|I really enjoy this album. And I think that there has been enough said on whether she is 'losing' her voice. Regardless if she is, she can still sing 100 times better than you or I.<br />'Oh Holy Night' is second to Celine's version in my mind, Whitneys take is haunting, and beautifully arranged.<br />I think this is a solid effort from begging to end, I just wish everyone would stop slagging her and give the lady a break. People's voices change, and Whitney's has, but it still sounds excellent.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Though an ardent fan of both the LoTR novels and Peter Jackson's renditions, I - like many - felt that Two Towers was a bit choppy and thin compared to the warm up of Fellowship.<br />This extended edition dashes those feelings.  The extra footage makes it an entirely new movie. It is now complete, full of depth and wonder.  Essential thematic elements from the books - glossed over or entirely ignored in the cinematic release of Two Towers -have been filled in through the previously missing scenes.<br />It is now on par with the introductory film of the trilogy.  I only find it sad that an epic such as this must be pared down to placate the average theatre-goer's minute attention span.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|The good thing about Pink is that she doesn't stay in one place for long. This album is great, not weak. <br />It's got strong songs, and how can you go wrong with production by Tim Armstrong? Who knows, and I don't care. <br />Stand outs: God Is A DJ, Last To Know, Oh My God, Humble Neighborhood and the secret song 'Hooker'<br />Enjoy the music for what it's worth...and though it is not deep, it's fun. So party up, 'cause that's what Pink wants you to do...<br />Five out of Five
B00005JM0B|4.0|If he really made $30 million for this role, which is just mind-numbing, it would be interesting to see his per-word payout, because he really doesn't have a lot of dialogue.<br />The plot points have been rehashed abundantly in other reviews, so I'll just spout a few opinions and leave it at that.<br />The opening chase scene in T2 was astounding -- the T-1000 pursuing the kiddie John Conner through L.A.  It was pulse-quickening and very engaging.  The requisite chase scene in T3 is not to be believed.  The sheer scale of destruction leaves the viewer slack-jawed.  I thought it was far more gripping than the computer-driven highway chase scene in &quot;Matrix Reloaded&quot; or &quot;Revisited&quot; or whatever that crap 2nd movie was in that franchise.  This is a great scene on DVD to watch with the 5.1 surround going strong.<br />A lot of things in the Terminator franchise really require the viewer to not ask too many difficult questions.  In the face of too much logic and scrutiny, it begins to unravel and break down.  However, if one can get past that, T3 is a completely enjoyable film.  I wouldn't call it a pure popcorn flick (I reserve that for completely mindless tripe like &quot;Armageddon&quot;), because it does have some intelligence in it.  It does, however, require some insight on the part of the viewer as well.  Another reviewer asked where the soldiers were that should have been guarding Crystal Peak.  Well, it was a defunct, largely abandoned fallout shelter from the Cold War era, accessible only by plane and in the middle of a vast desert with a single point of entry gained through a massive blast door with encrypted security codes.  Really, are guards necessary for this?  No.  As with the previous Terminator movies, there's much to which one has to pay attention.<br />Claire Danes was remarkable in her role.  She totally sold me on a young woman whose entire world came crashing down in a span of about 14 hours.  She went from living a sane, normal life to being surrounded by cataclysmic explosions, kidnapped, stalked by killer robots from the future, losing both her fiance and her father and fleeing the state with a guy she hadn't seen in 10 years.  Rather a lot for a person to take in, especially in less than a day's time, yet Danes conveys the emotions quite successfully.<br />I have always liked Nick Stahl and he does a pretty decent job as John Conner.  I'm not sure he was the best choice, but since Edward Furlong is apparently quite the drug addict these days, he was unavailable.  Stahl had a couple of moments in the movie where he really shined, although for the most part, he was a bit flat.<br />I actually thought this movie could have benefitted from being about 20 minutes longer.  The ending was good enough -- leaving it open for another sequel, but not necessary -- but it just felt too rushed.  T2 had excellent pacing, alternating the breathless action sequences with expository passages and character development scenes.<br />T3 is a good movie.  Not on par with T2, but still quite enjoyable.
0553278398|5.0|Can't say enough about Isaac Asimov, reading 'Prelude' was a great experience and seeing the peak of life on Trantor.  What was most fascinating was Daneel Olivaw's appearance.  Many of you remember him from the Robot series.<br />Harry Seldon's adventures start here; he is a very human and fallible subject (unlike the phrophesizing old man in Foundation.)  I think you will find that this is the best of the foundation series and it'll be hard to put down
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I will begin by saying that I am a Britney Spears fan.  I danced and sang to ...Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again, and when I was older, bumped and grinded, is that a word? to I'm A Slave 4 U.  In The Zone is a good album.  It starts off with Me Against the Music featuring Madonna.  The single is ok but is too cluttered.  It would have been better if was just Brit.  This is full on dance music.  There are only two ballads, &quot;Shadow&quot; written by the Matrix, the songwriters who made Avril Lavigne somebody special, and &quot;Everytime&quot;.  All the other songs are strictly made to shake your ass.  &quot;Toxic&quot; is one of my favorites, the beat is amazing.  &quot;Outrageous&quot; is probably the best song on the album. It is produced by R.Kelly and is Britney making fun of herself.  I would not recommend this CD for my 10 year old niece but I wouldn't recommend most of the CD's I buy for her.  This is Britney growing up and some of the songs are very adult.  As for her voice, it's never going to be on par with Christina Aguilera or Mariah Carey.  But her voice was never Britney's biggest draw was it?  In fact, it's not Madonna's or Janet Jackson's for that matter.  The bottom line is if you like to dance this is the album for you.
B000063DHL|5.0|I was 16 when this came out in 1986. What a year!!!<br />I was already a huge Maiden fan at the time, and after growing up with the epic releases &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot;, &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot;, and &quot;Powerslave&quot;, I must say that &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; was quite a refreshing change of pace...<br />This is one of the few Maiden releases I still go back to today when I want to hear the best of Iron Maiden. Even today, in 2003, this still sounds as fresh as ever. This was way ahead of it's time, and is nothing short of a masterpiece....<br />It opens on fire with &quot;Caught Somewhere In Time&quot;, the fastest, most melodic futuristic ride of your life. The other favorites of mine are &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, &quot;Sea Of Madness&quot;, &quot;Deva Vu&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, &quot;Stranger In A Stranger Land&quot;, and my personal favorite &quot;The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner&quot;..... <br />I think &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot; was also one of the best melodic efforts Iron Maiden ever produced. Both Dave and Adrian were in top form here, and the solos some of their best ever. The whole band was really focused here, as you can tell by listening to the flawless muscianship. Not even one song really leaves a bad taste in your mouth, and that's a pretty rare occurance in this business. Don't miss out on this masterpiece. It's one of Iron Maiden's finest hours. This thing just plain out smokes!!!....<br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!
B00008BXJF|5.0|Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto have delivered a masterpiece. Terrific album (and great live show)!
B000003C5C|5.0|Go buy this now!!!....    \\"Leprosy\\" is a classic. It's got brutality beyond, and some of the coolest riffs from Chuck and the boys. R. Rozz had a mean axe, and with him and Chuck playing off eachother, it ultimately  made \\"Leprosy\\" one of the most unique Death releases to date IMO....     Chuck and Death moved forward in the years after \\"Leprosy\\" was released, and the masterpieces continued with releases such as \\"Spiritual Healing\\", \\"Human\\", \\"Individual Thought Patterns\\", and my persoanl favorite \\"Symbolic\\", but \\"Leprosy\\" was always in my opinion the one that really got things rolling for Death....    This is one of Death's finest, and most enjoyable hours....    ~MJ~
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This DVD has the original version (The Pot scene IS there!!!) remasterized,and also has lots of other great stuff like the interviews and director-cuts!!!<BR>Simply AWESOME!!!
B00004U60I|1.0|Baby Bach is a cancer on the Baby Einstein series.  Young baby?  Get the original - Baby Einstein Language Nursery. Three months? Get Baby Beethoven.  Six month - Baby Van Gogh.  Got this?  Return it.  It's a shame to think some people are going to see this as their first Baby Einstein experience.  The best parts of the series are the varied toys moving across the screen and the playful puppets.  In this video it's just pictures of the toys.  They don't move.  You could play Bach on your stereo and flip through a magazine and have a better experience - at least the magazine only cost $3.  The puppeteer in this series is apparently a moron.  They don't do anything!  I have a sneaking suspicion they had exactly one hour to video tape this - how else can you explain in huge difference in this video from the others? The series are great - get the ones above.  Do not buy this one - it's a serious disappointment.  I am trying creative things to do with this DVD.  Like balance the coffee table with the box it came in.
6303441378|5.0|I do not want to go so far as to say that it is impossible to put together a really unsatisfying version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens, first, because I have not seen all of the versions ever made, and, second, because I do not want to tempt the fates.  This is a classic story for which most people have several favorites, from the 1951 Alistair Sims film to the animated &quot;Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol&quot; (I could have easily named another half dozen films to replace either one of those).  Still, with all of those versions floating out there is still room for those that retell the tale with a humorous touch, the best of which involved Mickey Mouse and the Muppets.<br />In &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; Michael Caine is the sole &quot;real&quot; person, playing Ebenezer Scrooge.  The performance is rather impressive when you take into account that he has to play straight man to the cast of Muppets but still manages to give the key moments of Dickens' story their gravity.  Basically, this version works because Caine never lets you know he is working with Muppets.  Persuading you to see this one is fairly simple.  You know the story and if you mention that Kermit the Frog is Bob Crachit, Miss Piggy is Emily Crachit, Fozzie Bear is Fozziwig (who else?), Robert the Frog is Tiny Tim, Waldorf and Statler is Robert and Jacob Marley, and the Great Gonzo is Charles Dickens, that should be enough to fire your imagination.  The ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come are &quot;new&quot; Muppets, which shows screenwriter Jerry Juhl and director Henson know how to preserve the spirit of the original while still letting the Muppets have their fun.<br />All things considered, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; is the merriest version of the Dickens' classic.  The songs are by that living Muppet, Paul Williams, the best of which is &quot;Marley and Marley,&quot; although the two big songs are &quot;When Love Is Found&quot; and &quot;It Feels Like Christmas.&quot;  None of these will become Christmas standards, but they are still enjoyable in the context of this charming movie.  Even better, it is not just for kids, but for all those who know Christmas and keep it in their hearts (and who are old enough to get all the jokes).;It Feels Like Christmas.&quot;  None of these will become Christmas standards, but they are still enjoyable in the context of this charming movie.  Even better, it is not just for kids, but for all those who know Christmas and keep it in their hearts (and who are old enough to get all the jokes).
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Gone are the strings. Gone is the choir. Gone are the dialogue bits. Gone are \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae.\\" Instead, we have great, unbelievably clear sound. This is the way these songs were meant to be heard.<br />Wait until you hear John and Paul singing \\"Two Of Us.\\" WOW! As with all of the other songs, you actually hear each voice. You actually hear each instrument. The sound and tone of each voice and instrument is infinitely better than the original. I'm not knocking Phil Spector, but as John once said, he made something out of the (crap) that we gave him. This CD however, is by far the choice you make if you want to hear the better of the two. The \\"live\\" songs \\"I've Got A Feeling,\\" \\"One After 909\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" kick butt!!!! You will \\"feel\\" the energy and intensity of each song. I'm very happy this version of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was included. Nice acoustic guitar and organ in \\"I Me Mine\\" that were buried in the original are now uncovered.<br />I would have given it 5 stars if the long version of \\"Dig It\\" was included, and I think George's guitar is not mixed prominently enough in \\"Dig A Pony\\" and \\"I've Got A Feeling.\\" However, again, the tone and sound of the guitar compensate for this mix.<br />Sometimes mistakes are never corrected. It took almost 35 years, but this one is now right. A definite buy for the Beatles fan. Bonus disc is OK, but not a reason in itself to buy.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I miss the dialogue, and I don't like the new sequencing (I program my cd player to the original sequence).  I would have preferred the  de-Spectorized &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; that was on Anthology 3, as the instrumental break in this one seems really cheesy (same with that of Let it Be).  &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; is a great replacement for &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;.  I like most of the songs in their raw form, so this is a vital document...however, it's not as charming as the original.
B00005Q5WC|5.0|I can't say I like the first CD more than the second; its just a question of what type of mood I am in at the time. There are many beautiful songs from LEGEND that I already loved on CD1 (&quot;Waiting in Vain,&quot; &quot;Three Little Birds,&quot; etc.) but the songs I hadn't heard are good for the most part. The bonus songs are quite good too. The best part though overall has to be on CD2 with the mind-staggering twenty minutes of &quot;Jamming&quot; into &quot;Exodus.&quot; I never thought reggae could be so inspiring and powerful! Geat stuff!
B000007XUQ|4.0|I grew up listening to the Carpenters, but not exactly by choice. I knew that their music could not very good. Why did I dislike this popular musical duo? Well, my parents owned a number of Carpenters' albums, so how could they be any good? The brother/sister duo was panned by many music critics and was viewed as too soft for the gritty 70's, but as is often the case, their music is regaining popularity and people are again appreciating the vocal talents of Karen Carpenter and the many musical gifts of her brother Richard. Perhaps now that I am about the same age my parents were when they enjoyed the Carpenters, I am appreciating the duos enormous talent as well.<br />THE CHRISTMAS COLLECTION is probably one of the best examples of the Carpenters' varied musical gifts. Karen sings her heart out in the contemporary numbers, especially their own \\"Merry Christmas Darling.\\" Her sincerity can be detected in her renditions of the old, familiar Christmas songs and gives new life to some of the Christmas pop standards. The orchestration in the background, largely the gifts of Richard, is a combination of classical, jazz, and popular music combined and his musical settings seem appropriate for the different numbers.<br />The collection is great for background music during Christmas parties and gatherings. It can get a person in the holiday mood as well as help a person relax during the hectic moments of the holidays. This collection is now a classic and belongs in the CD library of anyone who loves Christmas music.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is the best damn DVD out there.  While you watch it, you can tell that every single person up there is really connected to the music because they love to play.  And to have George's son Dhani up there for the whole show was awesome.  Also, all of the interviews and rehearsals were very good because it showed the process of making this show so special.  I recommend buying this DVD and watching it from beginning to end, because you'll keep wanting more.
B000055WIQ|5.0|Did you know this is a true story? Just kidding. This is the movie that would freak out religious fanatics for the rest of their lives. But yes it is a movie. A VERY EVIL movie. I only saw bits and peices from this film when I was a kid. Of course none of the scary scenes. The spider walk scene was unexpected. I knew it would happen but it came out of nowhere while I was watching it, which made it scary. I think they cut it out because it was too scary for it's time. Especially for people who get scared easily. And the scene, the very GRAPHIC scene when regan was on the bed and she had the cross in her hand, well the rest I can't write, but if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about. Was that scene in the original one? That was sick stuff. There were times when I had to laugh, especially the yo mama type comments, it made me think of Scary Movie 2. Hehe. Well, overall this was a unique and interesting movie. Just remember to sleep with the light on. He could be under the bed while you sleep.
B000089RVX|5.0|I haven't heard an album better than Fallen. Every part of the CD is unique, and the lead singer deviates from the overused scream-into-the-mic type of grunge. The poetic lyrics are the words of angels, and Amy Lee has her spot saved in the heavenly choir. Actually, her voice is really the frosting on the cake of Ben Moody's powerful guitar and Freese's driving drums, making a strikingly beautiful contrast.<BR>Every song speaks to the soul, from the mournful &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;, to the fervor and passion in &quot;Tourniquet&quot; and pleading cries in &quot;Last Breath&quot; (my favorite). <BR>Not to mention, each song has a lead-in or a musical transition from the previous song that you just can't get online. Take that, illegal downloaders!
B000068IEU|4.0|This movie was incredibly scary and could/would/should have surpassed a lot of the movies out there, but did not and i understand why. What was with the music? It was too up beat and happy....this is a horror movie...not a happy-go-lucky everyting ends fine movie. But besides the horrible score, this movie is one of Cravens best.<br />Mari and a friend are off to a concert when they stop to try and score some drugs and end up falling into the trap of a group of rapest psychos who take Mari and her friend hostage and make them miserable while raping them and torturing them and wonder into the woods where they kill both girls in a grisly way that makes Texas Chiansaw Massacre seem like a inferior movie ( when it is not ) and then we get to the 45 minute mark and it leaves us wondering 'what next' and it takes us up to the group staying at the house where Mari lived. Her mother and father welcome the group with open arms and that night the mother over hears things and snoops through thier sootcase and discovers what has happened and her and her husband set out to kill every last one if them in torturous manners. <br />This moive is not for everyone. It's a mix between a pornographic movie gone bad and a thriller/horror. This is definately not for the younger audiences and maybe not for some of the older audiences. This is an extremely violent gory unsetteling moive that will have almost anyone naushious and wanting it to end. This definatly achieved what Craven set out to do...make a disgusting movie that scared the audience half to death.
B000002W9Q|5.0|Dirty Dancing was just a wonderful movie. The love between Jeniffer and Patrick and the songs and the DANCING! It was my faviorite movie and I could watch it every day if I wanted to. It was such a good movie and the soundtracks just as good. Ahh, Dirty Dancing...
B00009UW0N|5.0|Texas Chainsaw Massacre was the only movie that had tapped into the idea of slasher movies and then comes along a movie that starts them all. HALLOWEEN is the best slasher film besides TCM and there's no reason why it should not be. It is wonderfully written directed acted scored and it is a great horror flick.<br />On Halloween night Mickael Myers grisily killed his older sister and vows to kill his younger sister Laurie and spends his childhood in a mental hospital and escapes and hunts down his sister. Halloween rolls around and the bodies pile up and Laurie finds herself in the middle of brutal murders and an insane unkillable man that will haunt her for countless sequals!<br />HALLOWEEN re-shaped horror and after it come out, horror and especially slasher horror became a movie of choice by all, the viewers and the moive makers. But this movie stands alone and should be crowned one of the scariest moives of all time.

His 44 revolver hovers over the crime-ridden streets in search of law and order. A man of his word to himself and the people he protected. This man was Wyatt Earp and Tombstone is his story.<BR>Hollywood pictures and Andrew G. Vajna present an epic, 130-minute tale in 1995. This isn't your typical western because it isn't your typical story. The epic saga of Wyatt Earp is as deep as the cast is vivid.<BR>Starring the acclaimed cast of Kurt Russell (Backdraft) as Wyatt Earp, Val Kilmer (The Doors) as the eccentric yet distinguished Doc Holliday, and Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Dana Delany, Jason Priestley, Michael Bien, and Charlton Heston round out the extraordinary cast that appears not to be acting at all.<BR>The suspense builds as the Earp's set forth to grab the brass ring of fortune.

B00009W8N2|5.0|Let's face it, Opeth has come a long way from being a bunch of friends from Sweden just playing music. Orchid happens to be the product of this Swedish Prog-Death band, and by far, it's one of their bests (along with Blackwater Park and Still Life). Songs like Under the Weeping Moon completely speak to listeners in a dark manner used so well by Mikael Akerfeldt, and the instrumentation is a complete bedazzlement. Percussion, Guitar, and Bass are absolutely riveting and loud throughout this album, and with a long history waiting for Opeth, this album easily can be set as one of their mile stones. A great album, and a must for aspiring Death, hard-core, or proggers for todays genres.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Lemme tell you something:  I have been an avid Whitney fan from the very beginning.  And I will continue to be such until the end of time cause I know she possesses a rare vocal instrument.  It is good to see Whitney bring her &quot;A-Game.&quot;  On One Wish, Whitney is blowing through and holding notes with confidence and conviction. This is the type of music (classic songs with a spinkle of soulfulness for bite)Whitney's voice is clearly made for.  If you do not have this CD yet, immediately sign off and sprint to the nearest music store to demand your copy!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is easily one of the most compelling and soul-deep Sarah McLachlan works. This cd makes her previous ones seem &quot;unbroken-in&quot; or &quot;unawares&quot; of a depth that is unspeakable, a depth this cd strikes in her as an artist. Only a childish and insensitive listener would compare this to her previous works and draw this up short because this cd is like walking into the gallery of her very soul on such a personal level, in a museum of sorts and anyone that can't hear that with their own heart is, well... missing out.<br />Just watching her sing &quot;Fallen&quot; live reached the very core of my being as I felt this artist had truly painted a picture through sound that expressed my own journey lyrically then later seeing the video of this song, it cut to the core of my own life, something very few writers/singers/piano players have ever successfully accomplished.<br />&quot;So don't come around here and tell me I told you so&quot; are just some of the lyrics you'll be greated with that tell a layered and deep emotional story, and for me personally, this is the most moving of all of her cd's.<br />&quot;when stars have all gone out, you'll still be burning so bright&quot; and &quot;Knowing that you're loved no matter what&quot; are just some of the lyrics that tell the story of a love between a mother and her daughter, with Sarah expressing this as a daughter, and as a mother herself of a daughter.<br />The kind of cd you can put on and keep on. I'd give it 20 stars if I could. She writes and sings what is true to herself as an artist and is not trying to dance to critics or anyone else and that is very refreshing in the business where everyone is trying to get famous and they end up manipulating their own work to the point that it's like swiss cheese. A story for you Sarah, from a writer who has indeed been touched by your experience &quot;Blame it on the Flowers&quot;, for you: [...]
0064471837|5.0|This book is wonderful.  It is probably one of the best books I have ever read.  Garth Nix writing style is absolutely beatiful.  Although the story is a little complicated it is all easy to understand.  I would definitely recommend Lirael and Abhorsen as well although Sabriel is probably my favorite of the three.  Everything you could possibly want in a good book is included in Sabriel.  Beautiful description, romance, adventure, fantasy...EVERYTHING!  READ THIS BOOK!  IT IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER READ!
6305428425|5.0|This is a movie about two ditsy blondes: Romy and Michele. <br />Romy has a part-time job and Michele is unemployed. When Romy meets an old classmate (who invented the cigarette with the quick-burning paper &quot;twice the taste in half the time&quot;--slogan), she finds out that there is a 10-year high school reunion coming up for their school. She and Michele (they live together) realize that their lives aren't as great as they thought they were and decide to attend the reunion faking that they have great boyfriends and have jobs as buissinesswomen. During the time that they try to get boyfriends (this is before the actual reunion), they have flashbacks and have nostalgia about high school. Eventually, they go to the reunion and meet the people they once knew and disliked, as well as creating new relationships with people.  <br />I won't say what happens at the end (I don't want to ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it yet!), but I will say that this movie is full of laughs and is a really great movie! I wouldn't share this movie with children, however, as they probably wouldn't get some of the humor and there is some harsh language (probably why it's rated R) that you might not want them to hear. <br />I give this movie 5 stars for the hilarity, and for how much I've watched it over and over again.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is the first war movie that I have seen that has included the soldiers' support systems - their families.  It was refreshing to see that it is not just those on the battlefield being affected, but also those back home.  Though, I don't want to downplay the war portions of this movie because they were also fantastically done!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|In The Zone sounds more like recent techno-Madonna than the Britney we know. Not necessarily bad, but in this case? Try again Britney. As an owner of her three previous studio CDs, this one isn't really worth a download. The first single, Me Against the Music, tries for a funky eclectic beat, but I'll take I'm A Slave 4 U over it any day. Brave New Girl is so computer-generated, you begin to wonder if Britney is actually on the song. (I've Got That) Boom Boom sounds like just about any other of her previous \\"I-went-to-a-club-and-danced-for-you-then-we-hooked-up\\" songs. Boring, at best. Showdown and Breathe On Me use Britney's favorite adage: sex sells. The beats are good, but the lyrics are lacking. Early Mornin' and Toxic are rare stand-outs that are fresh and different. Early Mornin' uses great beats and semi-mature lyrics to bring Britney's image to adulthood. Toxic has an incredible sound and doesn't take itself too seriously like most of the rest of the CD. Outrageous and The Hook Up aren't even worth mentioning--their clones are found on just about any R&B singer's CDs. Touch of My Hand was talked about heavily in pre-album buzz. The topic might get those interested to purchase the CD, but they'll definitely be disappointed. The Asian beats and hokey lyrics sound anything BUT sexual. Everytime is the final stand out on this CD, showing that Britney's writing has evolved from the awful \\"Dear Diary\\", but how much of the song did she ACTUALLY write? Finally, Shadow was supposed to \\"prove\\" that she could sing, but it does anything but. In fact, her voice sounds overtly fake and over processed on every single track. Since the music won't bring you in, Britney'll just have to resort to half-nude photos, lesbian kisses, and teases about her sex life to make you buy the CD. An effort like this would be fine for a debut CD, but for a fourth LP by a seasoned performer that's supposed to bring her into maturity, it's nothing more than forgettable songs with clich topics. Instead, try Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\". Her writing and singing far surpass Britney's moaning and her co-star: the synthesizer. Even better is Britney's ex, Justin Timberlake's solo effort \\"Justified\\". The boy can truly belt out a song and writes some of the best pop music in recent memory. Brit, I think your career needs him more than you know.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Want to waste a few hours of your life? Then here is the perfect way to do it. The Matrix is terrible, the Matrix Reloaded is even worst, and if you go to the theaters to see the third chapter in this series you should put yourself in jail. These are the worst movies I have ever seen. And if you have ever seen them you should inform the studio that produced them to destroy all the reels of film like i have done. Please done waste hours of you life like I did on these movies.
1573225517|5.0|OK, this isn't really about my life, but there are some eerie similarities.  The movie even more so, since the film shifted the locale to Chicago, where I live.  So why do I say the book is about me?<br />1. My name is Robert and many (including my mother) call me Rob.<br />2. I have a major ex-girlfriend named Lara, which is quite close to Laura, the name of the book's ex-girlfriend.<br />3. I am an inveterate list maker.<br />4. I'm obsessive about great alternative music.<br />5. Like Rob in most of the book, my love life mainly sucks, and hopefully will turn out to be good as his does (still waiting on that resemblance to take place).<br />6. I'm chronically underemployed and a bit of an underachiever.<br />But I'm sure than many readers get the feeling that the book could almost be about them, even those readers not named Rob and not underemployed and not blessed with an ex-girlfriend named Laura (or even Lara).  The book is a masterful depiction of an average male inhabitant of 1995 in England, but it could just as easily be Australia or the United States or Canada, because of the way that pop culture has linked together the various nations of the English-speaking world.  This is part of the underlying point of the book, that the glue of our culture is not political beliefs or philosophical positions or social philosophies, but L.A. LAW and GONE WITH THE WIND and Stevie Wonder and the Ramones and TERMINATOR 2 and Gram Parsons.  Movies, TV, and music.  Not even novels make much of a dint in Rob's cultural universe.  I think the novel's familiarity with and obvious affection for the culture in which we all live and swim is the clue to why the book is so immediate in its appeal.  And the novel has a very real moral message behind this:  pop culture, as wonderful and invigorating as it is, sometimes obscures the way our involvement with it masks our own lack of substance and depth as individuals.<br />The novel is also very much about the need to commit, to not be afraid of taking risks.  It does this in a very compelling and non-didactical way.  Is the book a masterpiece?  No.  But it is, I believe, very much a snapshot of the way the world looked and felt in the late 20th century.  The book is highly entertaining, but it possesses archaeological significance:  for someone in the year 2273, wanting to know what life was like and felt like in 1995 (even though the novel is set earlier, that was the year it was published) one could do a lot worse than reading this book.  But in the meantime, this is a very entertaining book that anyone should consider picking up, even if your name isn't Rob.of taking risks.  It does this in a very compelling and non-didactical way.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|WHAT WAS SHE THINKING ... YEAH SHE CAN DANCE BUT SHE CAN'T SING A NOTE. THIS ABLUM WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. SHE TRIED TO BE LIKE MADONNA TOO MUCH AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. FIND YOUR OWN IDENTITY. IF I HAD THE CHOICE OR SEEING OR MEETING BRITNEY OR CHRISTINA..... I'D SEE CHRISTINA BECAUSE SHE CAN SING AND SHE HAS THE TALENT. YEAH SHE MAYBE SEXY AND OVER THE TOP BUT SHE HAS THE VOICE AND THE MOVES TO BE THAT WAY.
B00004W4UB|4.0|I have to disagree with the critique of Ms. Robert's acting.  It's been criticized before as \\"blah,\\" wooden or uninspired.  Perhaps because next to John Malcovich's gloriously over-the-top scene chewing Mr. Hyde she seems a little pale.  Or maybe it's because Mary Reilly is such a break in roles for her.  She isn't perky and cute like in \\"Pretty Woman\\" or assertively sexual as in \\"Erin Brokovich.\\"  But, then she's playing a Victorian housemaid.  A big-eyed, sad little drudge with an abused past, desperately and unwillingly in love with a man above her station.  When she is around her employer Dr. Jekyll, she is utterly controlled by social convention.  When she is near his alterego Mr. Hyde, she's petrified with fear.  And for good reason.  I would call her acting understated and subtly nuanced. Ms. Roberts communicates a lot with a glance, a silence or just a stirring of hands.  She's the counterpoint to the uninhibited Mr. Hyde.  And she keeps the film from descending into farce, which it very well could have.
B00006CXXU|5.0|WELL WHAT CAN SAY BUT WOW. VERY ORIGINAL AND VERY PERSONAL ALBUM. NO ARTIST AROUND CAN CATCH HER STAR. SHE WILL BE WITH US FOREVER BECAUSE SHE CAN SING AND DANCE BETTER THAN OTHER SO CALLED POP PRINCESSES. IN MY BOOK SHE IS A POP QUEEN THAT HAS MORE TALENT THAN OTHERS.
B00004W4UB|4.0|This film got panned at it's release, but the critics were unfairly hard on it.  They had no understanding of the Gothic Romance genre and had obviously never read the original story.  This film stays true to the Gothic formula (big house, virtuous heroine, dark secret, sexy employer)and is the most faithful to the original story that has yet been made.  It has a nice use of color sticking to black, white and grey, puncuated by blood red.  Which almost seems like an homage to the old Hammer-Horror films.  Glen Close is wonderful as always, though she and John Malcovich don't get enough scenes together to make the sparks really fly.  Judging by the trailer, some scenes were cut just before release.  Which is a pity as the last act seems a little rushed which somewhat deflates all the previous moody buildup.  Let's hope a director's cut with extended footage will one day be released.<br />Final Verdict:<br />If you like \\"Jane Eyre\\" and have read the original short-story of Dr. Jekyll, you'll like this.  If you'd rather have a root-canal than watch Kathy run through the mists one more time calling \\"Heathcliff, Heathcliff\\"---skip it.
0156027321|5.0|I never expected to get sucked into this novel like I did, but I'm certainly glad that I read the reviews on this site and gave this book a shot! Life of Pi is by far the best book I've read all year -- and the type of book I'll certainly read again! Beautifully written and substantial while being incredibly entertaining. This book is a rarity! Other recommended titles are Lovely Bones by Sebold, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B0000CEB4V|5.0|WOW.  This is really an exceptional DVD.  Eric Clapton put together a wonderful band of friends that is pleasing to anyone who ever listened to George's music or knew anything about his life.  McCartney and Ringo were wonderful.  I loved how Something combined the Uke and full blown versions.  JOE BROWN!!!!! I have never heard of this gentleman and was scratching my head going who is this guy?  I was pleasantly suprised by the songs that Mr. Brown performed especially That's the Way it Goes and obviously I'll See you in My Dreams. Everybody was Great.  The Pythons that were in attendance were divine.  Michael Palin's attempt at eulogizing George and scrapping it for the Lumberjack Song was hysterical.<BR>Do yourself a favor if you want to be thoroughly entertained for Two and a half hours then buy this DVD and watch it. <br />Everyone did a wonderful job.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Jeff Lynne, Billy Preston, Eric Clapton ( Beware of Darkness is an awesome song and I'm glad that it was performed as well a Wah Wah )

6305922748|5.0|Christopher Guest is probably the most brilliant comedy director living, and *This Is Spinal Tap* is one of the the most perfect examples of dead-pan humor around.  Some of the laughs are subtle (the obnoxious limo driver, the controlling girl friend, the dim-witted bass guitarist played by Guest himself) and some are howling out loud raucous.  Anyone who isn't in stitches by the &quot;Stonehenge&quot; sequence probably needs to have his or her pulse checked to make sure death hasn't intervened.<br />Perhaps they've spontaneously combusted or choked on vomit...

My wife watched with me as well. I was surprised, to say the least, and she fell in love with the show.  This will be a Christmas present for her, and she'll be ecstatic to see it.  And I'll really enjoy seeing the episodes we missed because of Fox, re-watching the other episodes and checking out the extras.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Just about all the fears I had about Terminator 3 were put to rest when I saw the film in theaters in July, and now that the film is on DVD, it's one of those movies that get better and better the more times you watch it.  While there are some continuity errors (in Terminator 2, John Connor was 10 years old, not 13 as is said in this film) and one to many plot points that rely on the &quot;fate&quot; principle of the films, all that aside this is still one of the best films to come out in this year's much hyped about summer.  Having prevented Judgement Day, the story finds an older John Connor (Nick Stahl) living &quot;off the grid&quot;; no phone, no home, no possible way for SkyNet to find him.  All that however quickly comes to an end, as John is re-introduced to an old friend (Claire Danes), both of whom soon find themselves being hunted by the T-X (the stunning Kristanna Loken).  Soon enough though, the T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger, the model number was T-800 to my recolection) is on the scene serving as protector once again.  Schwarzenegger is once again great in the role that made him a superstar, and the acting from Stahl and Danes is great as well.  Loken, who may be easy on the eyes, just doesn't strike the same kind of fear that Robert Patrick's T-1000 did in T2.  Director Jonathan Mostow (Breakdown, U-571) is a worthy sucessor to James Cameron, and T3 features some of the best special effects and stunt work to be seen in quite some time.  The highway scene in which Stahl and Danes are on the run from the T-X driving a huge crane with Arnie not far behind, has to be seen to be believed.  All in all, Terminator 3 rises way above the expectations that many had, and proves to be much, much more than just a cash in.  The DVD itself is nicely put together, and the deleted Sgt. Candy scene is worth the price of admission alone.
B0000025US|5.0|Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, and Paco De Lucia produce some of the finest acoustic guitar work ever recorded.  Everything about this album is perfect.  They play Flamenco the way it's meant to be played.  If you're looking for something that obliterates the likes of Ottmar Liebert, &quot;Passion, Fire, and Grace&quot; is it.  Don't take my word for it; listen for yourself!
B000003N7R|5.0|At first hearing, this half-hour plus of piano and sax comes off as quietly competent, sweet and sentimental. Not present is the frantic  Coltrane of &quot;Giant Steps&quot; or Duke's big band boldness. It's Duke on piano, but in a subordinate role to 'Trane except that he was responsible for creating most of the tunes selected. In this small group studio date, even the swinging minutes are intimate ones. But listen closely, use some earphones, and get familiar with the contents. Then the session comes to life. Duke was ending one of the longest careers in American music. Coltrane was, unknown to all, only five years from the end of one of the most brilliant and controversial careers in jazz. They spent about five hours together in the famous Rudy Van Gelder studio in Northern New Jersey, with help from skilled rhythm section, making this 1962 album for Coltrane's &quot;Impulse!&quot; label. Coltrane had already begun his forays into avant-garde &quot;free jazz&quot;, leaving many fans behind, but this day he chose to stay accessible and honor Duke with his improvisations on famous and obscure Ellington themes. Duke honored John by declaring him worthy of his attention and support. Fans of each man should own the result, and will find it easy to play this repeatedly. It didn't itself break new ground, or climb the sales charts. Overall, it isn't any more wonderful than the Coltrane albums &quot;Lush Life&quot;, &quot;Soultrane&quot;, &quot;Crescent&quot; or &quot;Settin' the Pace.&quot; But it is just as good, and that's saying a lot.
B00005JMFI|5.0|When I first saw the previews for Elf, I thought it looked hilarious. I finally saw it with my best friend, and we both loved it. Elf is a cute, warm, and funny movie. It's about a young guy named Buddy (Will Ferrel) who was adopted by elves. He soon finds out that he isn't an elf, and Santa tells Buddy to go find his real father in New York. The whole movie is great, hilarious, and warm and cute during Buddy's journey. I recommend it to anyone. :) In my opinion, I think \\"Elf\\" is a Christmas classic! :)

You can flip through the songlist and play individual songs or you can sit and enjoy the whole concert at once. The quality of the image is excellent,  and if you have a few speakers, you'll certainly enjoy the surround sound feature. <BR>Shania and her bandmates look and sound fantastic! They make such an excellent ensemble and their performance in this concert is worth every penny.
B00005JMFR|5.0|This one is in my opinion, the best in the trilogy. But this one really tests if you really care enough to see more of the characters and their situations.<BR>Special Effects-Incredible. Better than the first two. The Zion war is really cool, as is the Super Brawl between Agent Smith and Neo. Awesome. 10/10<BR>Acting-The same as the first two, cheesy and sometimes confusing, but less of the latter. It's still good though, for what's there. 8/10<BR>Sound-These movies introduced some interesting sound effects never before heard. This movie continues the tradition.10/10<BR>Story-A lot of people said this entry in the trilogy lacked a good story. I felt that it was a better plot than Reloaded, meaning nothing has been dumbed down. The story is great, but I have a complaint. The ending was so unbelievably infuriating, i almost stood up and yelled so many profanities. You may too. But when you get mad, remember this: the story isn't over. Next year, a massive online multiplayer game is coming out, continuing the story of the humans and their struggle with the machines. It's being developed as we speak.<br />With that in mind, go to the movie with your expectations down. It will work better that way. You may be pleasantly surprised at how smashing this movie is. Cheers.
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you saw Shania's tv Chicago special this dvd will provide you with the entire concert. It features 6 songs that did not air on tv. If you have never seen Shania perform this concert will open your eyes to how much charisma and stage presents she has. Shania seems more comfortable on stage then any performer i've ever seen. After seeing &quot;When You Kiss Me.&quot; sung live the song is distinctly romantic and will definitely be a huge success. The most adorable part is when Shania brings 3 little girls on stage to introduce &quot;I'm Gonna Getcha Good.&quot; Shania doesn't only enjoy singing on stage it very clear she also enjoys the camaraderie that she has with her band. The audience also seems to provide Shania with an energy that appears to be endless. Shania is a better entertainer then most. Shania knows what her fans want and she delivers it to them!
B000002897|5.0|I walked out the door about 10 year ago...and told my household<BR>I was going out to find Sweet Oblivion!!!..Well that night I went out to a friends house , drank a bottle of vodka,8 beers and went driving...crashed my car...went to jail...all that...damn...<br />Now all these years later...Im listening to the cd again...and Im floored...Mark Lanegan sounds like a dying man with some hope,,,,and the band rocks..the death chant...this is not the Grunge band that the papers talked about...this is the real stuff...pain...hell...drugs..drinking....man Im glad Im still around to write this...<BR>Rock on...
B0000TB03W|5.0|I saw more life and action in Shania than I have seen before. There was more depth to her singing.  Shania has such joy of being in front of the people. Shania loves to entertain and make people happy with her music. Shania has found a new level of depth in her songs off of UP! Which next to her classic songs you will clearly hear.  She has proven over and over she is a true super star before but now no one can disagree that she is the new Queen of country music. Her songs can only be done by her and they inspire everyone who hears them. Live in Chicago is a mile stone.
B00005JH9W|4.0|This film came out the year my dad was born....1933....<BR>its amazing to me to watch a movie this old and still find it <BR>thrilling and a bit scarey. If youve read all the other reviews then you know about the Director and Writer...Bla Bla...<BR>but overall..let me tell you...this movie is cool..Odd and a bit insane...circus freaks and their daily lives....a bit like a soap opera....but oh so demented....if you like twisted tales of love and revenge then watch this.<BR>I waited about 15 years to finally see this film....it was well worth the wait....
B0000TB03W|5.0|This dvd will show you why Shania rules! Shania is a commanding performer. Whether she's along side her band or down in the crowd. Shania is always captivating. This dvd will demonstrate why she is a wonderful entertainer and one of the best songwriters out there!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Wow, this DVD is more than I expected. Shania is so talented and she deserves everything she has gotten. The songs are so up beat and the ballads are lovely. I love the way the concert was shot, it was huge, but also intimate!
B0000TB03W|5.0|With the video clarity and the 5.1 digital surround sound it all makes for a  fantastic concert. Every single song is my favorite they all absolutely rocked. There are  quick camera changes and lots of audience shots  I loved this DVD. Shania is always on the go.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I'm not a fan of christmas music, but with this album, every song is perfectly produced, perfectly sung and the song selection is awesome.  I didn't know what to expect after all the problems that Whitney has had in the last few years, but I'm happy that she still delivered a great album and that her voice still sounds excellent.   Highly recommended.
0060512806|4.0|While this book is obviously long (1132 pages for the stubby paperback) there is so much going that progress thru the book moves quickly. Think of Bobby Shaftoe as a combined Forrest Gump and John McClain (Die Hard) rolled into one. Starting with Lawrence Waterhouse and Alan Turing in the New Jersey Pine Barrens (20 minutes from my place of residence) and going to present day jungles in the Philippines and many characters transversing the globe, this book has alot going for it. Code breakers during World War 2 (Enigma) set out to keep each other on one`s collective toes. Company executives for Epiphyte in the present work to get a complicated internet system established. The chapters go back and forth and are connected with the relatives and offspring of L. Waterhouse (past)/Randy Waterhouse(present)  Bobby Shaftoe (past)/Amy;Douglas MacArthur Shaftoe (present). A number of scenes are beyond hilarious with Bobby being ask to open the crates on the ship with an axe.....no spoilers here, and Goto Dengo tring to remember a message to the Corporal`s family keep this book going. While the people in the book are brilliant, the technical aspects and code breaking math are made simple and occupy little of the story. WHY they all do it is interesting. Other reviews I`ve read seem to pick on one thing and that`s the fact that most of the character`s refer to Japan and the Japanese as Nips or Nipponese. Maybe in 1942 but a lawyer in the present would not tell Randy he should get a hold of Sony/Panasonic or some other Nipponese company. Also one review said there was too much profanity and gratuitous relations......not in the book I read. All of us want great reading , but B. Shaftoe would not know about a Casbah in Algiers or La Pasyon art. Finding out why the guys (Randy/Avi/Tom/Ed/the Dentist) go thru all the trouble they do makes for a wonderful read sorta like \\"It`s A Mad , Mad, Mad, Mad World\\". My interest in languages and unbreakable reading of texts (the Voynich Manuscript) along with a recent documentary on a missing U-boat of the Jersey coast made this a special read for me anyway.ipt) along with a recent documentary on a missing U-boat of the Jersey coast made this a special read for me anyway.
0156027321|5.0|Fateful moments and the decisions of others propel us toward unexpected futures:  Pi tells a story--which may or may not be true--of a journey across the Pacific ocean in which his only companions were wild animals spilled into the ocean with him.  Woven into his story are the  unusual experiences of his childhood in India, descriptions of his family, and episodes of confrontation with three major religions of the world.<BR>In the end, we are left to negotiate with Pi the state of his mind, the solidness of our own personal truths, and the effects that violence and tragedy have upon everyone's lives.  Be advised that you should be prepared for the surprise that Yann Martel delivers!
B000002I25|5.0|Released in 1967, the Doors groundbreaking first album remains the standardbearer by which journeys of self-discovery are made through music. For years, the critics focussed on their reptilian, sometimes bloody lyrics, and proclaimed that the Doors music was \\"all about evil.\\" Thankfully, time has softened this view; if the band's music sometimes seems evil, it is because we are seeing ourselves, our own mirrored reflection, the evil (as well as the good) we carry in all of us. The band's very name came from quotes made by Aldous Huxley and William Blake concerning \\"the doors of perception,\\" and if self-discovery and finding out the purpose and meaning of Existence is important to you, then you must discover the Doors. \\"Break on Through\\" deals with breaking through doors, i.e. barriers, between night and day, known and unknown, possibly even sanity and insanity. Drummer John Densmore kick-starts a hypnotic beat, guitarist Robbie Krieger pushes the song forward with classic figures, and keyboardist Ray Manzarek spins the first of his many memorable organ solos as singer Jim Morrison wails, shouts, and begs for understanding. It's as great a beginning to an album (and a career) as has ever been recorded. \\"Soul Kitchen,\\" is the first of many much-needed breathers; love, companionship, and great food can be found in this homey little restaurant if you \\"learn to forget.\\" \\"The Crystal Ship\\" conjures up a heavenly view of thousands of fellow travelers on a one-way boat to Nirvana, and is the Doors most breathtakingly beautiful ballad. \\"20Th Century Fox\\" is a fashionable, sexy song about a fashionable, sexy lady, no more and no less. \\"Alabama Song,\\" written by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill and featured in their opera The Rise and Fall of The City of Mahoganny (not Threepenny Opera, as is sometimes reported), is another breather, pure German beer-hall, oompah delight! \\"Light My Fire\\" is the album's titanic hit, with near-perfect solos by Ray and Robbie, and Jim's most romaticperformance ever. \\"Back Door Man\\" is Howlin' Wolf blues and proves that the roots of the Doors, as with so many contemporaries, lie deep in the soil of black America. \\"I Looked at You\\" is a brief little ditty with a charming, carnival-style hook. \\"End of the Night\\" includes lyrics reportedly taken from the Tibetian book of the Dead and is the band at it's most mystical; everyone shines on this one. \\"Take it as it Comes\\" is similar to \\"I Looked at You,\\" but more hypnotic and insistant, more great organ by Ray. Finally, we come to The End, the masterpiece that pulls the album and it's themes all together; The End of Self as we knew it.  Robbie's guitar is at its most mournful best, and Jim's wail seems to split time and space and travel down to us through centuries past, with a particularly strong retelling of the Oedipus myth midsong. (Reportedly, when the Doors played Mexico, this was their most requested song.) In summary, a stunning debut and one of the best rock albums ever recorded. Let the Doors start you on your own journey of self-discovery today. The doors of perception await!!!
B000002H97|5.0|Ok, first off, everyone out there that says, &quot;oh this album would be so kickass if Cliff was here, Metallica is nothing without him.&quot; Shut the F**k up. You'd say the same if Lars or Kirk died. Second, don't knock this album because it's more radio friendly/sellout whatever you think it is. It's still good music and I know that everyone of you would do the same thing if you knew it'd make you millions of dollars. Just because it's not your exact description of heavy metal doesn't mean it's not good. Open your mind to other styles douche bags. The only Metallica I've ever not liked was St. Anger which was crap because it was simply that, crap. This isn't crap, it's going in a slightly different direction and making millions along the way. Go to hell you fascists.
0671027344|4.0|This book is pretty good. It kept me entertained. It was a little random at the end but at the same time went with the book. i would reccomend it to people that liked books like speak and other wallflower books.
076790592X|5.0|The feeling you recieve after reading this book is inexplainable. I would recomend this experience to anyone. It goes by so fast, that I plan on reading it again (and I never do that). Enjoy it, and maybe from it, learn to enjoy life. Disfruta todo (enjoy all)
B0000CAQ27|2.0|I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM NON-STOP FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS.  IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT P!NK IS DARING TO TRY NEW GENRE.  THIS ONE HAS A LOT OF ROCK ELEMENTS -- QUITE REMINDING YOU OF 80'S ROCK N' ROLL ERA.  OH! A LITTLE ALTERNATIVE ERA TOO!  BUT YOU'LL GET BORED WITHIN A MONTH'S TIME IF YOU JUST KEEP IT ROLLING.  P!NK'S VOCAL IS GETTING PRETTY 'UNNATURAL'. HER FORCED CROAKY VOICE IS SOUNDING MORE LIKE A 'SULKY'. THESE ARE OLD FORMULAS.  IT'S WORTHWHILE, BUT NOT IN A LONG RUN.  IF YOU ARE A FAN, YOU CAN ADD THIS TO YOUR P!NK'S CDS COLLECTION.  IF NOT, TRY SOMETHING ELSE!
B00005JMF6|5.0|Well, there is a lot to be said about this movie, and having seen it last night, it is still fresh in my mind.  Halle Berry plays brilliant psychologist Dr. Miranda Grey( and quite well too) and works in a mental institution.  Dr. Grey spends time talking with Penelope Cruz's character( sorry, but I cannot remember her name) who tells her that she has been raped( and don't worry, this doesn't give away any important segments in the film).  \\"It's hard to trust someone when they think you are crazy.\\"  One night, Dr. Grey gets into an accident while driving through a bridge in the pouring down rain( and I won't tell you what happens there).  When she awakes, she is suddenly a patient in the very hospital where she works!!!  This movie is slightly reminiscent of Stir of Echoes and FearDotCom.  I could go on and on about this movie, but it's better than you see it for yourself.  Remember, negative statements about a movie should not be taken seriously.  Just because so and so was disappointed, doesn't mean that the rest of us have to be.  Anyways, good luck and enjoy!
0425180638|5.0|I just finished reading The Last Precinct and was pleasantly surprised. Based on editorial reviews, I was expecting a disappointing conclusion to the Kay Scarpetta series. But I read it out of loyalty to my favorite series and my &quot;idol&quot;, Patricia Cornwell. And I discovered that I liked the new Kay. She's no longer perfectly calm and collected and even more like somebody I could like and relate to. The beginning will likely scare off readers who are in it for the investigations and morgue scenes, as there are few scenes in the morgue at the beginning, but dedicated readers will stick with it and be rewarded in the end. I was slightly disappointed when she skipped ahead two weeks, leaving out most of the motel scene, but I still enjoyed the book immensely. I can't wait to read Blowfly (which I bought and then realized I'd have to read The Last Precinct first) but once it's done, I'll miss the Scarpetta series :(
B000002J0B|5.0|After the runaway success of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV,&quot; Led Zeppelin reconvened and did the absolutely astounding---they recorded a follow-up album that's even *better* than &quot;Zeppelin IV&quot; (though I certainly love &quot;Zeppelin IV,&quot; mind you). 1973's &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; is, in my opinion, the band's masterpiece, a barnburning album that showcases all different sides to this legendary group, from the thrilling, galloping rock of &quot;The Song Remains The Same,&quot; to the stunningly beautiful &quot;The Rain Song,&quot; to the excellent acoustic/hard rock hybrid &quot;Over The Hills And Far Away,&quot; to the cheerful, masterful, good-time rock of &quot;The Crunge,&quot; &quot;Dancing Days,&quot; &quot;D'yer Mak'er,&quot; and the fun finale, &quot;The Ocean.&quot; But the album's secret weapon, if you have to pick one, is &quot;No Quarter,&quot; a magnificent, heavy, ominous song, and one of the band's most potent numbers. Robert Plant's vocals soar and swoop throughout the album with great gusto, Jimmy Page blows the doors off you with his magnificent fretwork, John Paul Jones' bass is a booming work of art, and his keyboard playing throughout is supreme, while the late, great John Bonham, is, as always, a towering monster on the drumkit. Cap it all off with Page's brilliant production and a stunning, memorable album cover (in this case, anonymous nude girls climbing on rocks) and you've got yourself a Led Zeppelin masterpiece. &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; is a thrilling Zeppelin album, with Led Zeppelin totally on top of the world and on top of their game. An outstanding rock classic.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is the best DVD in the world.  With this DVD, everyone will be able to see what a wonderful performer Shania is.  For those of us who weren't able to see the show live, this is the next best thing.  You'll want to watch it over and over again.
B000089RVR|1.0|We just bought this and it is very distorted.  A search of the web reveals that Arista is using some kind of copy protection that is causing a lot of home CD players problems.  Posters are advising to look for one that has the &quot;Compact Disc Digital Audio&quot; logo if you want one that you can be sure will work with your player.
B0000CFW87|5.0|No doubt a masterpiece of masterpieces.  I have listened to CLOSER for two weeks now.  Without a doubt, it is one of the finest vocal recordings of our time.  Masterpiece is too small a word for such beautiful music.  Every song is meaninful, masterful, mindful and magical.  Listen to vocal, lyrical and orchestral mastery.  No matter where I listen, in the car, working, at home, relaxing, I am continually in awe with the eloquence of the music and Josh Groban's God-given voice.  He is a young master and his inspiring music is filled with so much intelligence, passion and love.  I both weep and jump for joy and thrill with the majesty and greatness of it all.  I promise you, there is no way to hide from this music, it will reach into your heart and soul and move you to your depths, as it has touched me to my inner core. Flawlessly beautiful.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney...oops - guess what everyone - she didn't do it again this time. Let me first say that I am NOT a Britney fan, in fact I absolutely detest (still to this day) her \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops...I Did it Again\\" days. Take one listen to the latter and each song sounds completely alike, with the exception of only one or two. \\"Britney\\" showed a slight improvement with the racy \\"Slave 4 U\\", \\"Overprotected\\" and \\"Boys\\". So when I heard that she had another CD out, I was hoping that she would still be improving. My hopes were smashed when I heard the lead single. After hearing other songs off of this record, however, my mind began to wonder about last year's \\"Stripped\\" disc from Christina. Anyone realize that while \\"Dirrty\\" was OK, it was NOT the best song off of that CD. After I heard the mediocre \\"Dirrty\\", I was turned off, but alas to uncover so many precious jewels. Britney seems to have fallen into the same trap with \\"Me Against the Music\\" featuring the timeless Madonna. But with closer listens, Britney's album has more depth than all of her three previous discs combined. Hot dance tracks reminiscent of Kylie Minogue stand out (especially the hot \\"Breathe On Me\\"). It seems like forever, pop artists have decided to take a \\"hip-hop\\" approach to their bubble-gum pop, and it always ended up sounding like fabricated bubble-gum pop. Britney ACTUALLY (and finally...) has some off the hook hip-hop. \\"Boom Boom\\" with the Ying Yang Twins and the tight \\"Outrageous\\", produced by R. Kelly, are standouts. Filler song \\"Toxic\\" is especially nice, although there really is no way to categorize that. My personal favorite song, however, is the one that I personally believe has shown Britney's growing maturity. \\"Everytime\\" with words AND music written by Britney, is the most amazing song that has ever appeared on any of her discs, and is probably the most refreshing songs I've heard from ANYONE in quite some time. Yes, you may be thinking about the fact that Britney also wrote\\"Dear Diary\\", but this has absolutely no similarity. The music, the vocals (yes, the vocals...) are simply breathtaking. Britney is, believe it or not, growing up. Cracks me up everytime I hear the media talking about how bad she is, talking about (gasp) sex. Well, after a listening of \\"In the Zone\\", you'll notice that Britney Spears has, in fact, grown up (or at least is growing up). \\"Good Lord, the little hussy flipped the bird to the paparazzi!\\", says the dad who probably offers that same finger in normal traffic. Believe it or not, Britney's an actual human being, making mistakes. This album shows so much of that reality. I would seriously advise all to at least give this disc a chance and see all of this growth.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The only complaint I have about this DVD package is that unlike the Fellowship of the Rings box, the company decided to *glue* the &quot;features sheet&quot; to the back of the box!  (sorry, I don't really know how to describe this sheet but when you see it, or own the Fellowship box, you will know what I mean).  I ruined my box trying to the remove this sheet and the glue residue :-(.
0425180638|4.0|If you haven't read any of Cornwell's books before, start with one of her earlier ones first because they (the Kay Scarpettas) run in a sequential manner.  I have read many of her books and have enjoyed all of them, some a little more than others. Read the &quot;Black Notice&quot; before you read this one.  The last two books have been getting a little weirder and you need to stretch your imagination a little bit.  At first you think the condition of the murder suspect is a little absurb and unbelievable and yet... as you continue reading, the author draws you into the story.  Because of the ending of the story one wonders if the author has run out of ideas for the Scarpetta stories and is moving on to something new.  <br />Scarpetta is a different person than the one we are used to seeing...a more subdued, defeatist and feeling sorry for herself person.  She is being accused of crimes and must find the evidence to defend herself and no one, even her friends, seem to be able to help.  She has lost the man she loves to a horrific murder and after so many years of catching killers, to be accused as one herself seems absurb.  I enjoyed the book even though it was not one of my favorites and look forward to reading her next book &quot;Blow Fly&quot;.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Highlights - &quot;toxic&quot; - fast addictive (like rachel sevens &quot;swet dreams my L.A. ex&quot;)<br />Breathe on me - fast, electro, smooth (alot like something off fever)<br />Outrageous - think B2K pandemonium<br />Britneys traded in her well known trade mark style for other peoples which is risky, but also very good that she can get it right, and still manage to maintain that little bit of britney that has been there - she should make sure she always keep that trademark as it is vital for any successful popstar. <br />4 stars because some areas of the album were lacking abit (I got that boom boom, a climax to nothing really!)
0385504209|1.0|Scary, very scary. I don't mean to be nasty or holier than thou--I'm a guy who fully agrees with King about &quot;get over intellectual snobbery in writing&quot;--but holy cow.<br />Its scary how many copies of this book have been sold by word of mouth. It's got a mediocre-at-best concept ripped off from mid-80s conspiracy theories, and is absolutely, positively, and incredibly horribly written.<br />For example, in one passage, a cargo truck's tires &quot;hum&quot; quietly. But the very next paragraph describes &quot;the truck roaring down the highway.&quot; Next paragraph: back to a gentle hum.<br />One character speaks a select phrase into a phone quickly---it says she &quot;knows how to be precise&quot;....for its time saving virtue. But when she speaks again, she pauses....for Brown to ramble on about some fact he almost left out.<br />This is what I mean...the book is so poorly written that the author often contradicts himself in successive sentences. The characters are laughably flat. The plot is so ridiculous it would rejected as sotry for a comic book. I really just don't understand why it is so wildly popular...do people really enjoy being treated like idiots? The book really does sound like it was written by an adolescent and intended for 6th graders. Do yourself a favor...pick up some King, Steinbeck, or Tartt instead.<br />And don't go see it when it graces your local theater either...it has already been optioned--go figure. Hollywood wants to make another brain dead thriller.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Between the time I had ordered my Two Towers DVD I read three of four reviews, saying that they had many problems with the special features disks (looping between first 2 tracks, black screen). They even said thy exchanged it with another set and had the problem again! Added to that was the theatrical version DVD I ordered fom amazon skipped at the end. As you could imagine, when it arrived and I went to watch it I was very nervous. The movie worked fine, the DVD picture/sound quality was excellent, the new scenes seamlessly flowed with the old ones. Then I put in disk 3. The menu came up and I played the first documentary. A releif. The rest of the documentaris played fine also (they were amazing). Thank God. Disk four was fine, and I couldn't be happier. Other people has also said they have problems with the packaging(torn DVD case,etc. Mine was in great condition. And could it look any cooler?  All I can say to those who had problems is that you have my condolences. This DVD set is a great value and deserves five stars for everything.<BR>Go buy it! Amd hopefully everything will work!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|honestly the only songs on the original lp which were spectorized were Long and winding road, i me mine and Across the universe. everything else on the original album was pretty much the original take that was recorded either on the rooftop or the studio. if youre a beatle freaK then you already know that the versions of Long and winding,I me mine and across the universe are already on the Anthology. The single version of Let it be on <BR>Past Masters was fine with me and wasnt a Spector production.So all that really leaves is Dont let me down which isnt really a &quot;take&quot; per say but a mix of different takes because there was never a perfect studio take of that song. Even the version we know and love is a very spliced up recording from many takes. there are some slight differences in some of the songs on here that werent really necessary like changing the guitar solo in Let it be and removing the fun studio chatter.Ive got a feeling starts off with the normal rooftop take and then towards the end is spliced with some other take. i dont know if whoever produced this thought i wouldnt notice but these supposed &quot;raw&quot; takes without production, probably took longer to produce than the original with all the cleaning up and splicing different takes. This new naked album is supposed to make you think that the Beatles were really great and into recording this album. If youve ever seen the Let it Be movie you know that it was the worst session they ever did and they were totally not into it.The exception to that is the rooftop stuff, but all the twickenham stuff [if you listen to the bootlegs] is really bad and depressing.Once in a while they got something down that was good and when they did, believe me it was put on the album.The reason i am giving it 3 stars even though i complained about it is because all the songs are and always were great no matter what you do to them.
B000089RVX|3.0|I was a bit disappoionted with Fallen. It just doesn't seem to have all the balls that I was expecting. I find much of the album to be bland, and somewhat sterile. The content leaves much to be desired; I want more than what they are giving; the drums are held back at times, the guitar tracks and the chord patterns are cliche (6-4-5).<br />I believe that any band coming from a certain vain is a direct product of their predecessors-in this case Korn, LB, (too many others to mention). I also believe that the music such a band produces should yeild a higher degree of ass-kick than those influencial bands the ruled before. Evanescence's music just sounds a little &quot;put together&quot; (packaged), a little  homogenized, a little commercial (ized) and contrived. (They kicked ass on the American Music Awards though [?].) <br />I do love hearing a chick-singer spilling all of her baggage out all over the place to the right music (Poe is a great example of this). However, I don't believe the music (ALL of it) serves her best interest here and I found Fallen to have fallen a bit short of this mark.  <br />I'm keeping it but I hope this band is just laying the tracks for something better in music's future.

B000127LW2|5.0|I have to admit, like all new star trek shows, I wasn't very enamoured with STV.  But as the seasons wore on, especially with the advent of Seven of Nine, I grew to really enjoy this Star Trek series.  The storylines got better and I always enjoy watching the growth of characters.  And you can always count on that with Star Trek.  It's been awhile since I've seen Voyager episodes and it'll be nice experiencing the evolution of this series all over again!
B000002NBY|5.0|Hailed as a pinnacle of Paul Simon career, this 1986 album combined his stellar songwriting with influences of South African music. It won scores of Grammies and also in the recent Rolling Stone poll placed in the Top 100 of best albums in rock&amp;roll history.<br />Grooves and hooks are played by such improbable instruments as accordion (witness the fantastic opener, &quot;The Boy In The Bubble&quot;) and human voices (female choir on &quot;I Know What I Know&quot;). The unique vocal group Ladysmith Blackmambazo lends a gentle Zulu stamp on, for instance, the charming &quot;Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes&quot; and Linda Ronstadt offers tender guest vocals on &quot;Under African Skies&quot;. Video fans will certainly remember the clip to &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot;, featuring Chevy Chase. The classic title track has a reference to American South, including Elvis and Mississippi delta, which highlights Simon as not focusing solely on one source of inspiration. &quot;Gumboots&quot; is the tune that kicked off the whole project. In fact, just the final two tracks have the bar dropped slightly from otherwise a jaw-dropping quality of the album, boasting also intellectually challenging, yet poetic, lyrics.<br />Carrying a significant socio-political accent -- at the time of release South Africa was still in the throes of institutionalised apartheid and as such boycotted by the world -- &quot;Graceland&quot; is a fabulous piece of 1980's culture and belongs to the cream the pop music has to offer. It will remain timeless. Consider buying it? Don't hesitate.
B00005JMFR|4.0|This movie was an execelent film. Even though they were only in the Matrix like 2 times. The special effects were still really good. The battle for Zion between the machines and humans ends.The Street fight between Neo and Agent Smith. Though the ending was kind of corny.For those of you who saw it know what I'm talking about. I give this a 4 star rating because of the good special effects and good plot line. I can't wait for it to comes out on DVD April 6, 2004.And for any LOTR fans out there The Lord of the Rings he Return of the King comes out on DVD May 25,2004.
B0000TB03W|4.0|This dvd is amazing. She sings great on it and performs well. Everyone should go and get this dvd now. I love it and can't stop watching it since I got it!
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Just buy it. It is one of the best albums I ever bought with the best songs of Coldplay. Praise Coldplay.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was completly shocked with how much I love this album.  I heard for the first time at my friends house, and went to go buy it the next day. This is a truly great album, some of my favorites are Walk Away(which I think should of been a single), Fighter, Infatuation,LovingMe4 me, Impossible, Beautiful, <BR>Soar(THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE 2),I'm Ok, Keep on Singin my song. Christina has the greatest voice, and this album showcases it. I love how she can mix great party songs with inspirational ballads. She a diverse artist,and should be given credit for it. An album like this puts her rivials to shame.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|There's so much diversity in this CD that reflects her past and new styles - it shows that she can surly try everything and be good at it.<br />1. Me Against the Music (4/5) - First single released that caught my attention right away.  Britney has introduced a more urban mood to her songs that definately shows maturity.<br />2. (I got that) Boom Boom (4/5) - fun song, definately a good choice putting the Ying Yang twins on it because they add to the hip-hop feel of this party song &quot;get on the floor and shake that a**&quot;<br />3. Showdown (3/5) - this song is slightly lacking and reptitive, but worth the listen while you are driving- it has depth and lots of bass.<br />4. Breathe on me (4/5) - this one sounds kind of ambient, like it would be playing in one of those car commercials.<br />5. Early Mornin' (3/5) - co-written by Moby, this one has a catchy beat and makes you want to relax.<br />6. Toxic (5/5) - this song has such a different feeling from her past works, upcoming single maybe?  the lyrics are good and the way the song is composed fits it perfectly.<br />7. Outrageous (5/5) - written by R.Kelly, i wouldnt be surprised hearing this song at an upbeat night club or party.  its not loud or fast but has a lot of good slow layers to it.<br />8. Touch of my hand (5/5) - great orchestral incorporation in this song, i wish i could get a karaoke version of it!  kind of slow, but full of emotion also.<br />9. The hook up (4/5) - great beat to dance to in this song, sounds kind of simple at first, but you'll find yourself moving to the beat without thinking.<br />10. Shadow (5/5) - lovely emotional ballad with tons of feeling behind it.<br />11. Brave New Girl (3/5) - Nice beat but it sounds kind of.. how can i say.. Cartoonish?<br />12. Everytime (5/5) - very emotional with a great piano accompaniment that ties this closing song together perfectly.<br />13. Me Against the Music remix (4/5) - great remix, it makes the song a bit more similar to a faster version of &quot;the hook up&quot;ok up&quot;
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The Get Back Sessions were supposed to give the world the &quot;Get Back&quot; Album. Instead, and due to the group dissintegration, we had the only  album not produced by Sir George Martin, and titled &quot;Let it be&quot; , as long as the Get Back project was a failure and this was released as the last original published album by the Group, much better then the title &quot;Let it be&quot; like saying Good bye , than &quot;Get Back&quot; (a bad title for a, everybody knew, last album).<br />The production of &quot;Let it be&quot;, one year later, was done in pressence of some Beatles like John, but Paul, was out, maybe in Scotland as the band was actually finnished, not announced though. Phil Spector with John did that job. The Let it be of Phil Spector, was done John beleiving that the tapes of the Get back sessions were rubbish and that there was nothing better to do with them. Maybe, what was more likely to happen is that as the Band was not a Band anymore and peace was elsewere but in Vietnam and Beatles no one wanted to take care of it so it is more like an orphan album.<br />Is Let it be a bad album? Some people say at least that it is below standards of a Beatle album, wich obviouly is extremely high. Just look the predeccessor (in being published but not in being recorded) Abbey Road if you don't want to go to Revolver.<br />Now, let us put it this way:<br />Is Let it Be a bad song? Is Get Back a bad song? Is Across te Universe a bad song? Is the Long and Winding Road a bad song?<br />Maybe, just those, are four of the best songs by The Beatles. <br />Now, can an Album that contains four gems of the Beatles, be a bad album? for me, the answer is obvious. <br />Let it be naked, is the nearest thing to the Get Back project that possibly could have been done. If this is not titled Get Back is maybe not to missunderstand people making them beleive this is  a new album. We still do not know and maybe never, what Get Back should have been if they were not splitting as a band actually.<br />Quality remains, no matter of the production you provide. Good songs are always good songs, with George Martin or Phil Spector. The Beatles were a superb band and not even a paranoid Spector and bad feelings between beatles in those particularly days ruined the music.<br />The Let it be Naked was produced without any beatles pressence. The project was allowed by Ringo, George (in his testament) , Paul and the family of John. People saying this was a Mccartney attempt to re-write history just don't know what they are saying or may be they are fanatics of John instead of the Beatles, that ussually finnish with a negative anti McCartney attitude. But for the rest of the mortals, the ones that like The Beatles, the four of them, and that believe that the best of them was the four of them all together (even John and Paul, yes), can find an extraordinary album, complementary to the original production by Spector. McCartney was right with The Long and Winding Road, and maybe John was right with Spector in Across the Universe. Now we have both and know the truth.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|This is a really good CD!!! A great homage to one of the most influencial artists of this past century.<br />And to monkeytot from Detroit, MI USA, he truly isn't a pop fan, and this is not a false advertisement. Mr. Harrison was not on the concert, because he's dead!! And his concert was a homage for him!! You should have seen the concert before making a review and putting one star where five are exprected.
0385504209|5.0|i loved this book, usually i'm not into suspense, but this really knocked off my socks.  I could not put the book down for a second.  And I'm a college student taking a full class load.  It was just amazing.  I highly recommend it to people who beleive there is more out there that we don't know, and want to see all the different things that most people never realize. The research that went into this book was incredible, and made me really understand how much work goes into a book like this one.  A must read for all levels of readers.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Very rarely a singing talent comes along who stuns you with their ability.  Josh Groban has so much talent for such a young man.  His ability to intrepet songs like &quot;Broken Vow&quot; makes me wonder if he can truly be so young.  As a woman who lived his lyrics, I am shaken each time by his passion and beautiful voice.
B0000004F9|2.0|i dunno i htoguth this cd was knida cheesy sounding.  mabye i didnt like it cuz the first song really sucked and i lost intrest from the start.  whenever i listen to it  i always skip the first track.  this cd is quite annoying at some parts also.  dont buy this cd unless youve heard it before and really liked it.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream Theater has always been a band known for trying to outdo themselves on each successive album, and Train of Thought is no exception. Simply put, the band carves out new musical territory, playing with ferocity and skill that puts other metal outfits to shame.<br />But while this work features technically brilliant playing (including an absolutely astounding perpetual motion solo from Petrucci on the final track), it seems to lack the feeling of Dream Theater's past outings. While the album contains shades of their 3rd record, Awake, in terms of heaviness, it lacks Awake's sense of humanity and awareness and gives the listener, instead, track after track of anger - anger at pop mainstream music, parents and childhood pasts, violent religious sects - and wearies with repeat listens.<br />The songs themselves seem somewhat pieced together, and while other bands would have made a mess of putting such riffs into song, Dream Theater does well, but overall, cohesiveness is lacking. A few tracks seem to go on without knowing when to end and then, abruptly, cut off with little warning. <br />Overall, Train of Thought is a well-made, well-produced album. However, one cannot help but think that a little more time spent rewriting lyrics or fitting riffs and melodies together with fewer exposed seams would have done the album some good. Not every cd can be Scenes From a Memory - no band is capable of that - but when you come to expect so much from a band that always delivers, it is hard not to be a little disappointed by Train of Thought.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|The rise and fall of Cuban gangster Tony Montanana.The DVD is exelent especially the sound and picture.While it is not better than The Godfather,this movie will be on the list of the best gangster movies of all time.The only flaw of the DVD is it does not have commentary but besides that the DVD is a good buy.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I really don't know what is wrong with all u haters. The first time Britney dropped a CD it was evident that she didn't have tremendous vocal ability but who cares. Show business is all about image and that is what Britney has; a great image. Kelly Price and Lil Mo have good voices, but do their albums sell? 'NO'. Madonna has a good image, and sells quite a few albums despite her heavy instrumentals and little voice use. I think Britney has a wonderful career ahead of her. I hated her at first but then i realized she is a great performer and that is what i like,a good performance and it takes a whole lot more than voice to put together a great performance. Her latest CD sounds rather good and i've only listened to it once so far. I found &quot;Toxic&quot; to be rather catchy. I know i will listen to this album over and over again. U go Britney.
6304806442|5.0|This movie is about Mark Renton a generation x slacker and his friends who are all addicted to drugs.It chronicles his trys <BR>to get of the stuff but he strugles because of his mates.The DVD has the feel that you are watching it in the theater.This movie is not for everyone because of its depiction of drugs.This is definely not for kids.This movie makes sure you do not have any doubt that drugs are bad.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I love Erykah Badu so much and I relate to her more than any other musician. We're both vegetarian, into natural ways of life, and both deeply spiritual. Worldwide Underground was written during a very depressing time in the world, right after September 11th and the beginning of the Bush's stupid war, and I think the music reflects that. Yet, in the song, &quot;Love of my life Worldwide&quot; she says &quot;Don't cha give up, keep goin', keep goin'...&quot; and that always inspires me. We're coming to a new age of existance where two groups will be formed: Those for the revolution (A peaceful, godly one, I pray) and those against it!
B00005YU1O|5.0|I think this movie is brilliant.You have to be smart to understand it.The DVD is great.The movie is about different views of life and dreams.
B000069I1H|2.0|If you are a fan of Eddy Murphy, you will simply love this one too.The story is kind of you have seen it in numerous movies before and Murphy is just too previsible in his jokes.DeNiro is alright as usual but well ! He was funnier in Meet My Parents.<BR>There is not much to say about it. I will just add that the beginning is maybe the funniest part ! and it's a pity that Murphy role become too serious at the end !
B00009TB5G|5.0|Who would have thought that it could have got any better! This version is great, it gives you so much more insight into the film and the way Tolkien wrote the story. The amount of extra material is fantastic, there are no questions left unanswered. Massive respect to Peter Jackson and crew for sharing it all with us.
B00005JKBC|5.0|If you do like movies with complicated plot, many flashback and a lot of dialog, Go For It ! My opinion : BORING ! Is there a mistake or what ?! The action starts in 91, Redford talks about his first meeting with Pitt through a flashback, in Vietnam in 75. They look exactly the same in 75 and 91.Not believable at all.They should have used younger actors or at the least, choose someone else than Brad Pitt, too young for the role.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Although much less than reading the books themselves, watching these Peter Jackson films is still like stepping into another world for a short while.  Sort of like being a kid again.  Awesome!  Awaiting the third installment of the series coming in December 2003.  The extended movie gets 5 stars.<br />However:<BR>I just got The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers (Special Extended DVD Edition).  I have an DVD player which plays the movie just fine (discs 1 and 2), but won't play discs 3 and 4, which are the appendices of the set.  The discs in question are not defective because I'm watching them right now on my PC.  OR ARE THEY?!  Are these discs encoded with something new that hinders play on some units?  Will New Line offer any help with this?  My DVD player has never had a problem playing ANY other DVDs (including all four discs of The Fellowship of The Ring: Special Edition) but with discs 3 and 4 of TTT: Special Edition the TV screen is blank (black) while the unit jostles back and forth between titles 1 and 2 of the menu trying to figure out what to do.  Apparently, I'm not the only one to experience this.  On Amazon.com others have reported the same problems.  <br />I've sent a version of this concern to New Line and to [...]  I should suggest that other consumers having issues like this do the same.  Perhaps the problem will be tended to.  Haven't heard back so far.... <BR>As a loyal fan who owns both versions of both movies, I'll be returning THIS set until someone sorts it all out.  Wow, after all of the work that went into packaging, marketing, and the movie itself you think they would've been a little more thorough with something like DVD compatibilty/playability.  <br />And after all of that anticipation...just ridiculous.
B000002JB3|4.0|This album is one of Phil's best. It exibits all that is Phil Collins. I am especially pleased with the song &quot;Lorenzo&quot; The story behind that song is inspiring. Lorenzo is a man that is living with ALD (Adrenoleukodystrophy). Before him, every boy that had had this genetic disorder had died within two years of diagnosis, mostly before the age of ten. Lorenzo's parents invented an oil which stops the debilitation of the disease, but does not reverse that damage that is already done. These parents fought for their boy who is still alive today (He's 23). Michaela and Augosto (Lorenzo's parents) wrote the lyrics to this song for Lorenzo. It is truly inspiring and adds to this album.
B00009L1TA|4.0|I believe that there is much to be said about a film that uses cinematic experience to lead you astray.<br />This film seems to know what your thinking and quite cleverly follows you visually on that journey to ultimate discovery. <br />The actors pull of a believable performance and John travolta's even moulded his piled on pounds for the role!!  <br />If your looking for a well screened, well scripted film that quite pleasantly expects you to use your brain a little bit then i highly recommend this film- it's easily on a par with phone booth and the recruit.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|It's a good guess that American McGee's Alice was inspired from this movie.  Instead of the funny dances, singing, and the nonchalant task to get back home, the world is a twisted nightmare with aides and moments of reprieve far and few between.<br />Dorothy takes up the task to abolish a dominating king that finds his actions justified for his perceived wrong that every individual of the emerald city must pay the price for.  She is far more resourceful and has a look of intelligence rather than a prisy, naive look.  Heh, what girl power's all about.
B00005JMF6|3.0|Gothika is a fun thriller with a fast pace. Protagonist Halle Berry stars as a psychiatric doctor working in a modern day mental institution. Things get fun when she encounters what seems to be a demon and passes out, then awakens inside the mental institution as a patient and learns that she is being accussed of killing her husband(which she has no memory of)...<br />Gothika starts a bit slow, but heats up with a heart pounding pace.  Halle does a great job of keeping her audience, as she plays a strong female character(that female audiences will embrace), while Male audiences will embrace Berrys curvy body running and bouncing around in tight clothes. Penelope Cruz(although with a annoying accent) pulls off a superb Co-starring performance, but unfortunatly she had less screen time then she deserved.<br />There was many times watching this film when I thought (wow, this is the best film I've seen this year), but the end of the movie ruins everything. For such a strange and unique movie, the cheezy ending is not what you crave. It's the biggest dissapointment in a ending since M. Night Shyamalans Signs. There is nothing worse then a great movie that completely falls apart at the end.<br />acting=4 stars<br />FX=4<br />ending=1 star<br />atmosphere=5 stars<br />Directing and Editing=3.5 stars<br />storyline=3.5 stars<br />meaningfullness=NA<br />replay value=2 stars<br />OVERALL= 3.29 stars<br />Gothika isn't perfect, but its still very much worth a look. While it's not worth purchasing on DVD, its worth a rent or a movie ticket purchase. Go for fun, not a masterpiece
B0000DJZA0|5.0|Excellency is what I meant....I don't care what the hell it means...you need to get a hobby or something man....seriously....because if criticizing my grammar is on top of your list of comebacks...get a new list.....Coldplay's awesome.
0446677450|5.0|I bought Rich Dad Poor Dad along with Rich Dad's Success stories and I am excited! I am investing in real estate and small cap stocks as recommended by Kiyosaki.

B00008EY9G|5.0|Just think of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Negroes, Hitchcock's Psycho,and add Raising Cain to the mould and what you get is one of the most intelligent suspense thrillers I have seen in a long while, with a twist at the end that will truly shock you.<BR>However these comparisons are more related to the mood, setting and atmosphere of the film rather than the content or style ,for James Mangold (Girls Interrupted, Copland) manages to direct  Michael Cooney's original script with his own undeniable touch.<BR>I will not write a lot about the story of the film, since it is the kind that the viewer should watch with a degree of ignorance in order to discover it all by him/herself, and any hints might very well ruin the explosive end:<BR>Save to say that during a violent storm a group of people become stranded in a remote motel,and soon enough they start dropping dead one by one in mysterious and sinister circumstances.Of course, nothing is really what it seems, and there lies a secret behind these deaths that unless you are a brightest of your local Mensa group,it will come totally unexpected.(Thank God I am not, and the ending blew my mind)<BR>Mangold is an able director, and he manages successfully to create the right mood for his film from the very start and keep the suspense till the very end, with the help of spot on editing. <BR>One aspect of Cooney's script which I found very well covered, is the fact that despite the relatively large number of characters in the film,each one (in varying degress of course), gets enough treatment to make him/her much more interesting.(Suspense/horror thrillers with many characters tend to emphasize more on two or three characters,leaving the rest not more than extras.)<BR>The casting was made of fine actors such as John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Rebecca De Mornay.But, personally watching any film, I largely expect the big stars to deliver their end of the bargain flawlessly,and some names are enough to attract the viewers regardlessof the genre, yet I love to discover the little relatively unknown supporting actors and actresses who give a performance as good if not better as their star colleagues. And surely enough, in Identity, I was greatly impressed by the performance of Pruitt Taylor Vince, notwithstanding his relatively short time on screen.He was the best thing in the average Trapped and yet again he proves that he is an actor of immense capabilities.<BR>So if you want an intelligent suspense film, with a great script, direction and acting, a movie that you will think about long after the credits roll, then look no further, for Identity is such a film, a valuable addition to your movie library.
B00000J7S8|1.0|I have to admit some Diana Krall cd's work nicely as easy listening, but this one just goes beyond the point of &quot;easy&quot; and into the realm of boring. This cd is bleak, and monotonous with predictable arrangements, Not to mention the instrumentation sounds pretty washed out. Also, it really puzzles me how many people find Diana Krall so amazing, and even dare compare her to greats of the past. These songs are simple, maybe that's why they're called standards, I don't know, and they're simple because it's the performer who is meant to breathe life and joy and pain into the songs. Diana Krall is just the opposite of that.Her voice is lifeless, her phrasing, liltless and uninspired .I love jazz, and I guess the reason Diana Krall is so successful is because, she is &quot;jazz' for people who love anything but.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Firstly, and I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but again, \\"quadrilogy\\" is not an acceptable word, because (check your dictionaries folks), it ain't a word. They could give the American populus a little more credit and call it Alien Tetralogy, as opposed to going with the George Bush word, ala, \\"Misunderestimated.\\" We know what you mean pal, but it's not a word. <br />Secondly, is it occuring to anyone else that Alien3  and Ressurection weren't good? At all? Or at least, compared to the first two? Okay, okay, so they're sprucing up all the movies. Release them individually, you think? Or don't make me pay 70 bucks (and that's discounted) for two movies I'm not going to watch? I mean, that's not occuring to anyone else? I KNOW I'm not the only one who feels the same way about this.
0451169514|5.0|&quot;It&quot; is so often regarded as a horror novel that it's hard to get a lot of people I know to read it. This is a shame because Stephen King's masterpiece is so much more than a cheesy gore-fest with cheap thrills. It is a story about growing up more than anything else, how we all believe in silly things as children and how we lose this as we become adults (of course, in this story belief in It actually makes It real). There are stories of racism faced by one of the main characters and his father. In many ways this is a story of how the times have changed between the 1950s and now. There are so many elements running through this novel that it would be a waste of time to label it as belonging to any one genre. While this is indeed a scary book at times, King's strongest talent is in developing believable characters. How he does it I may never understand, but he has successfully created dozens of characters in this book that have believable personalities. <br />&quot;It&quot; belongs in the list of the great classics of the 20th century.
B000002UAX|5.0|It is much different then the first albums of the beatles. Harrison fingerprint is well heard here. I keep forgetting this album then I come back to it and I find new gems as well as enjoying ones which I already loved before. I usually listen to it all the way through and then return to my favorite tracks. Every time I do it the favorite tracks are different. Happiness is a warm gun is my favorite nowadays.
B00006CXXU|1.0|The same like any other boring song's on the radio theses days!<BR>There is only 1 song on the album that had me enjoying it its called Beautiful but that song I got sick of it in a 2 weeks!<BR>I highly don't recomend this album!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|some of the production is good most of it is pretty dull and trite.  Her singing?  Non existent...its more electronica than a musician slash vocalist - britney will sell becuaseh er image selss simple - why even bother argueing those merits...she has a a whole brigade of brainwashed kids who want to worship someone and they have found a willing idol.  On average its better than her first three albums - however thats not saying much there is no breakaway single in this set.  The best song is toxic and its not that great - its an average track -----I listened to all the tracks and was not smitten with a single track - I suggest Outkast - now that album I instanteously loved - an album shouldnt HAVE TO grow on you - but even then In the zone wont hold you for that long - GET OUTKAST!!!!!!!! that album is eclectic and amzing!
B00005JM0B|2.0|I rented yesterday the movie to proof that it will not going to be better than T2 and exactly.  There some scenes with stupid &quot;jokes&quot; if we can say joke at, like Arni getting the stupid sunglass.  I expected a serious drama.  I only enjoyed whe short moment when the endoskeletons are marching and shooting (reminds me T2, thats a movie), the chase scene and the ending.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC's sophomore album Thirteen Step combines dark self reflective message with musical genious. But to fully appreciate the progression from their 2000 release Mer de Nom one must understand the dynamics of the band. Because of lead singer Maynard James Keenan's commitment to Tool the band began to split. Paz Lenchantin, bass and violin, left to join Zwan and soon after guitarist Troy van Leeuwen left APC to join Queens of the Stone Age(good band, worth a listen). With only a few tracks written lead guitarist Billy Howerdel, Josh Freese(drums) and vocalist Maynard James Keenan embarked on a search for replacements that would fit the band both in the studio and live.  Jeordie White, formally of Marilyn Manson, was soon introduced to Howerdel and came aboard to play bass. Finding Van Leewen's replacement was more difficult, but finallly James Iha commited to the band. The result, a combination of four completely different yet incredibly powerful bands for APC's creator and mastermind Billy Howerdel to work with. Thirteen Step provides incredible depth as it changes from beautiful harmonies to powerful leads with a certain flow that entrances the listener. This is one of the best full albums i have ever heard and its even better live! One might think the combination of Tool(Keenan), Smashing Pumpkins(Iha),the Vandals(Freese), and Marylin Manson(White) would create an ego thriving sellout but in fact it is as cohesive as anything i've ever heard and there isn't a note out of place.  Thirteen Step is a must have for anyone who enjoys quality music. And if you get the chance see them live.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|It saddens me to write this review, but I am severly disappointed with &quot;Train of Thought.&quot;  I feel that it is DT's weakest effort to date with James LaBrie.  Allow me to explain why:<br />My main problem with the album is in the band's arrangments. The band introduces a lot of really cool ideas in many of the songs, but instead of developing those ideas logically, Dream Theater squanders their potential. &quot;This Dying Soul,&quot; for instance, is all over the place. The song introduces riff after riff without exploring anything in depth. The result of this style of arranging is a hodge-podge of sound that assaults the listener without ever capturing the listener's attention. I wish that Dream Theater had exhibiting more of the songwriting discipline that it had with past albums like &quot;Awake.&quot; Some songs, especially &quot;In the Name of God,&quot; come close to being DT classics, but are ruined by the band's seeming unwillingness to use more restraint. The album would have also been much better if the band had chosen to limit the amount of flashy instrumental sections. As the albums stands right now, the shred solos lose their power due to overexposure.<br />Another problem I see with the album is it's lack of balance. &quot;Awake&quot; is a really heavy album, but it also wisely contains some tracks that are a break from the overall dark tone. In TOT, &quot;Vacant&quot; is the only contrasting piece. Unfortunately, &quot;Vacant&quot; arrives too late in the album to provide the listener with any break. If DT had trimmed the fat from most of the album tracks, then it would be a lot easier to handle TOT's lack of contrast.<br />I've been growing concerned about DT's increasingly blatant &quot;tributes&quot; to other bands. DT used to organically weave it's influences into it's music, but now it seems like DT is having an identity crisis. For example, &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; features a complete rip off of &quot;Blackened.&quot;  In other songson the album, I can hear DT making not-so-subtle nods to Megadeth, Godsmack, etc. I've never heard DT sound less like itself than on TOT.<br />In conclusion, I see TOT as an album of wasted potential. DT had some excellent ideas that are never fully-developed. The band sacfrifices tight songwriting in favor of instrumental pyrotechniques, and the band's lack of restraint and discpline weakens the overall album result. DT should realize that the key to good music is good songwriting and not flashy instrumental wanking.  Hopefully the band's train will get back on track with the next album
B00005K9LN|4.0|First, a note on the remaster: The Bonus track live version of \\"Grinder\\" was NOT recorded on the British Steel tour as they claim, but is taken from the radio broadcast concert from California on the Defenders Tour. When I first saw this falsehood, I went so far as to attempt to contact the band through their website to find out why they were trying to mislead people like that. I got no reply, but noticed that all the subsequent cd releases after the first four did not specify the source location of the bonus live recordings. I'm not claiming responsibility, but I sure hope they now realize that their fans aren't that stupid.<BR>Anyway, back to British Steel...<BR>Here come the anthems!! \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" was just the preamble, while British Steel was the body of their Metal Constitution and set the stage for the rest of their career, as far as subject matter goes. \\"Breaking the Law\\", \\"Living After Midnight\\", \\"You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise\\"--not a ballad in sight. But as with all of the remasters, take the printed lyrics with a grain of salt, because their accuracy is way off in some places.<BR>British Steel has a very upbeat, good time atmosphere throughout and nearly compels you to raise your fist and shout. Warning: doing this in your car will result in several strange glances from passers-by, and perhaps even the odd restraining order from people you don't even know.<BR>The only real downer here is Dave Holland, the new \\"drummer\\". WTF? The guy hardly ever uses his toms, instead utilizing a plain, boring Ringo Starr style of snare/kick-snare/kick which any drummer will tell you saps the music of any extra muscle it could've potentially had. It's no surprise that, four albums later, they replaced him with a drum machine for most of the recording, and soon after that they picked up Scott Travis. <BR>And Dave just didn't \\"look\\" the part, either. With that 'gay bar' mustache, goofy hair and bored-out-of-his-mind smirk, I was sure that he was the queer onein the band all along.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I love this DVD.  Shania has always been an awesome performer, in my opinion, and this is another of those awesome performances.
0385504209|5.0|This is the book that stimulates learning in many forms.  It forces a reader to contemplate beliefs and understandings on religion, politics, history, geography, mathmatics, art, technology, truth, lies, secrets and wisdom to name a few. The book is impossible to put down.  Dan Brown is the ACE of authors.  I recommend that everyone read this book.  This is an expertly written book that will be discussed for a long time. It inspires a reader with a quest for learning that continues after you finish the book.  See if you can finish the book without researching the art of DaVinci.  It will be one of many things you will want to learn more about.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This album is mostly club music and after a while it gets kind of annoying. I liked the last two songs, &quot;Brave Girl&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot; the best. &quot;Toxic&quot; was pretty catchy. I think she should just stick to pop music and avoid rap and raggae.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The special extended edition adds a lot of scenes that smoothed out the story line for me.  I'm not a rabid Tolkien fan, although I remember somewhat enjoying the story as a kid.  As a female, the movie in the theater seemed so much just about battle.  The DVD developed many of the characters much more deeply and made the story more enjoyable for me.  Highly recommended.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Although not a fan of Britney herself, I am (or should I say was) a fan of her music...that was before this CD.  If I were to hear the majority of songs on this CD without knowing the artist, I would never have guessed it was Britney Spears.  This is not because the songs are not 'typical' Britney Spears pop, but rather because her voice cannot be separated from the backup singers' voices.  Only on a few songs (ie. Me Against the Music) do you hear Britney sing without assistance from the backup singers.  Aswell, 'Brave New Girl' sounds like it belongs in the '80s, with the video full of flashy lights, balloons, and a bubble machine.  Although Britney has matured as a woman, 'Touch of My Hand' is just a bit too sexual for her young fans.  While I disagree that celebrities should be role models to children, Britney is in the spotlight and should keep that in mind.  Letting her fans know she 'got drunk til the break of dawn', 'passed out on the couch', and told a guy 'we can hook up at the hotel' isn't something that should be shared with these young fans that look up to her.  On a positive note, I really enjoy the music in 'Toxic', 'Me Against the Music' always gets me dancing, and I enjoy the heartfelt 'Everytime'.  All-in-all, I am very disappointed with the latest CD from Britney Spears; with all the publicity stunts she&#8217;s pulled lately, she should have the music to back it up, because she&#8217;s turning more into a (dirty) sex symbol than a musician.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Maybe not the most impressive cd Britney Spears has put out, but yet it was amazing!  I heard all the tracks before it came out but somehow I didn't fully appreciate it until I bought it.<BR>Review of the tracks:<BR>1.) Me Against the Music~~ I'm not really sure why she chose this as her first single.  The beats are catchy and it does feature Madonna, but after awhile you just get sick of it... it isn't the best song on the cd.<BR>2.) (I Got that) Boom Boom (feat. Ying Yang Twins)~~ definitely has a hip-hop feel to it, great beat, dance song.  The Ying Yang Twins add a great spin to it.. catchy, sexy song.<BR>3.) Showdown~~okay... the verses are mainly Britney talking in a breathy voice (think: \\"would you undo my zipper please?\\")  but the chorus is pretty good.<BR>4.) Breathe on me~~ Great song!!  Breathy vocals, think Kylie Minogue Fever.. amazing beats<BR>5.) Early Mornin'~~ only song I really said \\"ehhh, no\\" to.  The chorus is pretty much not her voice and not that great a song I don't think.<BR>6.) Toxic~~ one of the best songs on the cd!!!!  Great catchy beats, good vocals-- definitely an amazing song stuck in the middle of the cd waiting to be found :)<BR>7.) Outrageous~~ produced by R. Kelly, it has a hip hop feel with great beats.. even if you don't like her voice, the beats on this track especially are dance hit killer.<BR>8.) Touch of my Hand~~ again, sort of breathy, Kylie Minogue-like.  Talks about \\"indulging in yourself\\"-- although it has racy lyrics and breathy vocals, it is a great song that grows on you more and more.<BR>9.) The Hook Up~~ with a dancehall flavor, this song is great to dance to, in the verses her voice actually comes out clear!!  Fun song.<BR>10.) Shadow~~ not too crazy about the verses but the CHORUS IS AMAZING, a beautiful beautiful ballad.<BR>11.) Brave New Girl~~ wasn't great.. it's really different from all the tracks, more techno but also bubblegum.  Kind of different song.. not too crazy about it.<BR>12.) Everytime~~ THIS CD ISWORTH JUST THIS SONG-- absolutely amazing.. if you heard her sing it LIVE (She actually didn't lip-synch) on SNL I think she actually sounded better there.  Her voice is a little computerized, but it is pretty raw and the melody is beautiful with the piano in the back.  There are no background singers- just an empty, heartbreaking ballad.  On her ABC Special, she was playing the piano while singing a song- this was it.  Amazing.<BR>BONUS REMIX: okay.. if you didn't like the original, you won't like this version probably... it's jazzed up with MORE beats (can you get anymore?) and background vocals... dance-y.<br />Hope this helped.  It's worth the price.
0671449028|5.0|This book was the first book my daughter loved as a baby. We have most of the Boynton books, but this is the all-time favorite. She's 2 and still asks for it (we have it memorized now)!
B00005JM02|5.0|I think the last movie I reviewed here was Monsters Inc.  It was probably the last movie I saw too!  That tells you how much of a movie fan that I'm NOT!  But this one is just TOO GOOD TO BE MISSED!  Our family watched it together - our kids are grown or nearly grown.  We all laughed hysterically and loved it.  Two of my kids had seen it already, and had dissolved into laughter after repeating the line from the movie &quot;Just keep swimming, just keep swimming&quot; and &quot;I speak whale!&quot;, so we had to see what this was all about!<br />I did feel the opening part about Marlin's wife Coral and all their eggs (except Nemo) being devoured was sad and might be a little intense for young viewers, but other than that, the movie was a real winner.  Another reviewer said that if you have young children, you could skip that part and I agree.  <br />There are so many lessons here - and the sense of adventure - and the importance of love and family and friends is very clear here.  There is nothing not to like about &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;!  I didn't view the extra DVD material, but it sounds great from what I've read.  If you're interested in a family-oriented movie review of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and any other movies, check out Focus on the Family's &quot;Plugged In&quot; section - you'll find that at family.org.
B000005Z0E|1.0|I know a lot of you might say this album is hot or classic because it's Tupac but you have to be real with yourself.  This album is one of his weakest.  Brenda's Got a Baby is the only great track on this album.  Nas, Jay, and Biggie all dropped classics on their debut but it took Pac 4 albums to finally get there.  He's a legend no doubt, but just because you love Pac don't lie to yourself and say this album is great.  Though Pac didn't do too well on this album, it is nice to see that he was trying to rap way back in '93.  Once the east/west war started though, that's when he finally got popular and started making decent music.  RIP Tupac.
0066211697|4.0|`Bonjour Tristesse' is a typical French coming-of-age story. Written in the 1950s' it was an instantaneous scandal for dealing so clearly with teenagers and their sexuality. The times have change, we see the world in a different way, adolescents are the same, but this novel still holds the interest.<br />C&eacute;cile is a precocious seventeen-year-old girl who travels to the French Riviera in the company of her father and his mistress. She is used to having different women around with her father all the time. But when he decides to marry one of them, C&eacute;cile and her lover Cyril decide to do something to stop him. Meanwhile, she is also learning about life, love, sex and pleasures. All these life-changing experiences will make the girl grow up towards to womanhood.<br />Françoise Sagan writes about something she knew, and it makes the book very interesting to read. Her prose never sounds fake or far-fetched. Although, it is a little dated --some of C&eacute;cile's acts that were daring by that day are just `normal' nowadays-- it has not lost its freshness. The Riviera settings are beautifully described, and we're often asking what the girl will do next.<br />It is undeniable it is a novel about that time in our lives when we're not a child any more and not yet an adult. With a mind filled with questions, we're trying to define who we are and will be in the future to come. C&eacute;cile has to face tragic events to understand what her life is and what it will be like for the next years. While many consider her being a spoilt little brat, this is the time when she is forced to stop being that, and see she won't have her father papering her forever.<br />`Bonjour Tristesse' opens with a powerful paragraph that reads: `A strange melancholy pervades me to which I hesitate to give the name of sadness'. At this point, had we any doubts it is a book about teenage angst, they are all dissipated.<br />Sagan wrote this novel when she failed to pass her examination at Sorbonne. The book became an international best seller and also a movie. While `Bonjour Tristesse' is a short and quick book, it is a good work of fiction, and probably Sagan's masterpiece.an international best seller and also a movie.

B00005JLKB|1.0|I really think this show sucks cuz it has bad character development, all the characters have no personality, and its filled with cliches that never evolve into anything new. The story lines are very repetitive and never go anywhere....I really wish this series was cancelled
B00003CXTG|2.0|WHAT A JOKE! the only message in this film is : \\"Japan-BAD, USA-GOOD! it's OKAY if more than a MILLION Japanese CIVILIANS die (and are still suffering + dying till today due to radiation exposure) but it's BAD BAD BAD if 2,000+ American NAVY boys die\\"<br />you know what.. right after the scene where the Japanese dropped a missile at one of those ships, the credits should have started rolling. <br />i'm giving it a 2 star for the battle scenes that had pretty impressive cinematography. the rest.. a complete waste of time. ben affleck should be thrown out of the film biz.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|First of all, lest any reader has not heard \\"Let It Be\\", it's a fine record, worthy of any collection.  It may not be the best record the Beatles ever made but it IS a Beatles original-meaning it's full of great music.  In fact, it's distinctive in that it's the only good recording of the Beatles playing together live (unless you want to count the BBC radio tapes).  The live songs on Let it Be show what a powerhouse band they were and why they once created such a commotion in places like Hamburg and Liverpool.<br />Now, to the new version: the marketing message of \\"Let it be Naked\\" would have us believe this is an improved version of Let it Be-that this is how it should have been all along.  I don't agree with that pitch.  All in all, there's not that big of a difference between Let it Be and the newer version.  And, of the changes that exist, the results are mixed. <br />I understood Let it Be Naked was to be the same record as before, without the strings of Phil Spector (present on four songs of Let it Be), and without the in-between songs patter.   \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" would be a new addition. The shorts: \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" would be eliminated.    <br />Actually, Let It Be Naked contains some unadvertised, unexpected changes.  Most of the songs are slightly different-not just in the absence of strings but in alternate mixes or alternate takes.  Most of the changes are rather subtle, and some insignificant.  But a few were disconcerting to this listener who has listened to these songs at least hundreds of times over the past 30+ years. <br />\\"Get Back\\" and \\"I Dig a Pony\\" sound the same as before. One positive aspect of the new CD is that many of the instruments sound crisper, and their separation clearer.  This is evident, for instance, in \\"I Dig a Pony\\" where George's guitar solo rings out clear as a bell.<br />\\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is missing the strings, as expected.  But, for some very minor differences, it sounds to me essentially like the same song.  And I don't find it necessarily improved.      <br />The absence of strings does, however, improve the song \\"Let it Be\\". On the other hand, George's solo in \\"Let it Be\\" is quite a different one than the original released version, and I don't find it as appealing. <br />Two of my favorite songs in the original Let it Be are \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" and \\"One After 909\\"-particularly because of the phenomenal guitar work in each.  The section of \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" where it picks up speed and Paul is screaming and the guitar is screaming along with him is one of the finest moments in rock.  And, in \\"One after 909\\", George's hot Telecaster leads carry the song. Unfortunately, Let it Be Naked has messed with the mix and where the guitars in these two songs were bright and up-front in the original, now they are more subdued-and something precious is lost.   <br />\\"Across the Universe\\" is probably the song most changed by the absence of the strings.  Also missing from the original release is an apparently overdubbed electric guitar and an acoustic guitar at the end.  Frankly, I prefer the original Let it Be version with all these elements.   <br />A great addition to Let it Be Naked is \\"Don't Let me Down\\" (originally found on the \\"Hey Jude\\" vinyl and later on Past Masters Two) although it raises the question: why weren't other songs from the \\"Get Back\\" sessions included as well-one, \\"Because I Know You Love Me So\\" is even mentioned in some nice liner notes to the new CD.  \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", however, sounds like an alternate take from what we've heard before.  Although not distinctly different, the vocals, honestly, seem a bit more tired than in the original. <br />To put it into perspective, the changes between Let it Be and Let it be Naked are not all that significant other than the addition of a new song.  And, if you listen to Let it Be Naked several times you will likely soon forget the differences between it and the original Let it Be. I bought this CD because it'snew and because I love the Beatles.  But don't expect the new CD to be a vastly improved Let it Be, as the marketers (and some reviewers echoing their message) would have you believe.
B00008H2LB|5.0|THERE IS NO WAY TO DESCRIBE THE WAY THIS ALBUM MADE ME FEEL. I MUST HAVE LISTENED TO IT EVERYDAY, FOR A MONTH, ON A 45 MINUTE BUS RIDE TO WORK.

I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I HEARD &quot;NUMB&quot; I WAS SO ALTERED BY IT I FELL OUT OF BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN MY COUSIN TURNED IT ON. THE FIRST C.D WAS GOOD, BUT I CAN TRULY SAY THAT AFTER HEARING METEORA, I COULD DIE RIGHT NOW AND STILL BE HAPPY. I'VE BEEN TO EVERY CONCERT EVER PLAYED IN THE L.A AREA AND SAN DIEGO AND THEY WERE ALL JUST AS MIND BLOWING.

0553582445|5.0|I had never read any of Robin Hobb's books when I picked this one up. I was unaware there was a previous series, but when I started reading, it didn't matter. Hobb wrote so convincingly, and was so in touch with Fitz that I understood him quickly. The book was somewhat slow at the beginning, but I didn't care. It gives the newer readers time to step back and absorb the information, and the old readers time to get used to Fitz again.<br />Hobb's style of writing is that kind that puts a lump in your throat. It's believable, stirring. This is what is supposed to happen when you read a book: to feel all of the emotions the main character feels, to feel like you're really there walking down the road.<br />In the story, I must admit that I felt a tad irritated with the Fool. It wasn't until I read the Assassin's trilogy that I began to connect with him. That's just as well, for you have to understand him, as the entire series is named after him. There were a few other things that brought the book down, but in the long run, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.
B00005JMFO|5.0|This is how a romantic comedy should be done. Not that packaged dreck they keep trotting out the horrible Julia Roberts to steal our $7. Truly warm and funny, with great performances across the board. My only complaint is that, with so much going on, there were some things that were not resolved as well as I'd hoped. <BR>A minor complaint, to be sure, because this is a wonderful film that will lighten your load and make the world just a touch nicer a place to be for a little while.
B00009TB5G|5.0|If you have any complaint about the film adaptation and its comparison to the novels, you must buy this DVD set. Several of the added scenes are incredible and would have made the theatrical release more enjoyable, including the Huorns and Merry and Pippin's discovery of pipeweed.<br />However, the real reason I so highly recommend this set is the commentary on disc 3 titled, &quot;From Book to Script: Finding the Story&quot;. This is a piece by the writers, directors, and actors responding to all of the criticism from Tolkien's &quot;guardians&quot;, as they put it. You get the sense that they empathize with all of the rabid fans who tear their works apart online. The commentary reasons that these changes are better for the film adaptation, while honoring the novel as a classic that cannot be touched.<br />I was first very disgusted by some of the film's &quot;perceptions&quot; in the Two Towers. Now, while I still do not agree with all of the changes, I have much more respect for the writers and creators of this movie.<br />The rest of the material on the appendix discs is equally satisfying. Of exception is the creation of Gollum and Andy Serkis' tremendous contribution to the film.<br />If you enjoyed the extra discs that came with the Fellowship box, you will love these. From one fan to another, this is money well spent.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I am sure that there are those who are bothered, angry even, that Peter Jackson didn't take a more literal approach to his \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films.  To those people I would say that a literal word for word translation from text to screen (assuming such a thing were possible, which it's not) would be nothing but mimicry and in no way a tribute to Tolkien's genius.  Rather, I would argue that Jackson's superb interpretation of \\"The Two Towers\\" beautifully captures the spirit of Tolkien without being slavish in its devotion.  Moreover, Jackson successfully grounds his film in a recognizable reality, which serves to further engage the viewer.<br />There are three ways (generally speaking) in which Jackson puts his fingerprint on Tolkien.  The first is his interpretation of the text; areas in which without changing Tolkien he is nonetheless able to put his own spin on the text.  There are two salient and superb examples of this that come immediately to mind.  The first is that Jackson presents Gollum/Smeagol as a split personality.  Gollum is a malevolent deceitful being who lusts after the ring, and Smeagol is an almost childlike creature, fierce in his devotion, but easily hurt.  I found this approach to be utterly compelling, and a superb way to present Gollum, but at the same time, it is totally loyal to Tolkien's writing.  The second example is the presentation of Gandalf freeing Theoden from Saruman as a sort of exorcism.  Not only was this a visually intriguing way to present the scene, but it also shows great appreciation for Tolkien as a man.  As a devout Catholic, I suspect he would have appreciated the overtones that swirl about the exchange.<br />The second way in which Jackson captures Tolkien is in his portrayal of the characters.  Given the constraints of the film format, the director is forced to both condense and flesh out various characters and exchanges.  As such, it is critical that he portrays the characters appropriately, but within the context ofthe movie.  There are any number of excellent examples to Jackson's characterizations, but there are a few that come immediately to mind.  The first is using Gimli as  much needed comic relief, but doing so in such a way that doesn't degrade the character.  In fact, it has quite the opposite effect as it lends a certain emotional depth to the stalwart dwarf.  Another example is the conflicted Theoden who is almost Shakespearean in his portrayal.  Particularly moving was when at Theodred's grave he flatly states, \\"No parent should have to bury their child\\" and then breaks down.  Finally, Eowyn's unrequited love for Aragorn is nicely captured, and largely without any dialogue, using glances and expressions to convey the story.<br />Finally, there is Jackson's modification of Tolkien in order to both make the story work as a film and ground it in our present day reality.  Most surprising among these is the appearance of the Elves at Helm's Deep, as they come to honor the old alliances.  While completely absent from Tolkien's writing, I found this to be an excellent and effective modification.  By introducing the Elves, Jackson is able to paint a portrait of Allies fighting against a common enemy in the World War II sense.  Moreover, the elite Elves and Rohirrim fighting side by side against overwhelming odds echoes Thermopylae, where the grossly outnumbered Spartans saved Greece, and ultimately, Western Civilization, from the Persians.  The second approach is more subtle, but completely pervasive as Jackson takes a fantasy war and couches it in familiar terms.  For example there is a suicide bombing at one point during the Battle of Helm's Deep.  While entirely within the context of Tolkien, Jackson's presentation rather brutally echoes our own dangerous world.  Another fine example is Theoden's question, \\"What can men do against such reckless hate?\\" which rather succinctly captures the dilemma of fighting terrorism.<br />My only two complaints are relatively small.The first is an entirely unnecessary dream sequence between Arwen and Aragorn which badly distracts from the mounting tension between him and Eowyn.  The second is that while Faramir is ultimately true to the book, it takes far too long for him to realize the danger of the ring.  Part of the beauty of his character is how he stands in contrast to his brother Boromir, and this is somewhat eroded by Jackson's interpretation.<br />As for the discs themselves, they are everything one would expect based upon the first set, as the sound, picture and score are all superb.  Furthermore, I found the additional scenes to be generally excellent.  Theodred's funeral, which features a lament by Eowyn, was particularly moving.  Also, through the addition of a few key scenes, I found the ending to be far more satisfying.  The conclusions to the Battles of Helms Deep an Isengard are less abrupt, and Faramir is better rounded out.<BR>The extras are likewise superb and every bit as fascinating as the features from the first set.  I'm not one who is easily drawn in by commetary on costumes and make-up, but these discs are so comprehensive it is impossible not to be drawn in by them.  Finally, the audio commentaries are likewise comprehensive and interesting.<br />If you are looking for a slavish recreation of Tolkien's work, you would do well to pass on these discs.  However, if you appreciate the spirit of Tolkien's work, and fine filmmaking, you would do well to watch this film.  Furthermore, you will never find a better value, as the extra's included in this four disc set once again set the standard to which all other releases must strive.<br />Enjoy!<br />Jake Mohlman
B00008YLV2|4.0|I think its editing and use of music and sweeping cinematography is at times a little melodramatic, like something out of a Michael Bay film.  By the time we get to the scenes where they're flying over the city with megaphones giving emotional support to their P.O.W, it feels more like a dream sequence.  I also didn't like Scott's direction of the two guys with the M-60...too light-hearted and whimsical given the surrounding scenes.  It also focuses too much on the Rangers, and at times is too nice on them, many of whom were hiding in their Humvees and refusing to clear buildings.  The Deltas, along with a select few Rangers, kept the operation from being an entire loss and held that group together.  And I was disappointed they didn't show Filmore's comforting of a Ranger and then subsequent death, which really shook up a lot of the inexperienced kids who looked up to the elite, professional D-boys.  Still, gotta love all those low shutter angles and bleach bypass footage.  Fairly well done considering the oversights.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Before the movie was even released, there were tons of reviews of what may be. Well, I have to say, even though most were positive, they had no clue about what they were reviewing. The extended edition far surpasses anything we have seen thus far. In fact, it is nearly a completely different movie to its theatrical release. So much has been added, so many parts of the book added that were not there (though there are things that are not in the book at all, like the Elves coming to fight in Helms Deep, but I can accept this licence because they did fight their own wars in their area before leaving middle earth; plus, at one time men and elves fought together against the dark lord, and it is only fitting to have them do it again, even if it isn't part of the book). Many open ended questions that left you confused in the theatrical release are now answered. <br />The quality of the film is amazing, as are the special effects and all the other things. However, a good movie requires a great script, and the writers of this movie provided us with a fabulous script (too bad that Tolken's language, and he being an expert in language, is not as beautiful as the script writers often write; some dialogue is exactly from the book, but there are other things that are completely the creation of the writers, and they weave a spell of words that far surpasses what is in the book at times). There are times that lines said by one character in the book are given to another in the movie, but they fit so perfectly one would never question the end result. <br />I had no troubles with my copy; it played perfectly. I decided to watch some of disk three as well the same night, and it was very interesting to listen to how the book \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was even written. There are many different things from what you heard in the features on the first extended edition of \\"Fellowship of the Ring.\\" Therefore, you are not getting a bunch of repeated information. It was interesting to discover the challenge putting the book then to script and making a movie. Some scenes from the book simply won't work in a movie (exciting to read but visually dull) and the filmers noticed this as they filmed. Of course, much was left out, however, in this movie those who remember Pippen and Merry being saved from the roots of the tree will find that that event is now put into this movie, and believe it or not, it is far more effective here than where it occurs in the actual book. <br />There are so many little things added, and even the familiar scenes that seem there would be nothing to change have additions that flesh them out even more. The degradation of Frodo because of the power of the ring is far more noticeable (as it is in the book), and the double mindedness of Gallum is even greater, as is his hate and lust for the ring. <br />Though I enjoyed the second movie when I saw it in the theatre, it seemed too war heavy, or that is about all you could really remember about it -- someone was always fighting. In this version, there is so much other going on, as in the book, that the war seems a part of a whole, not the main point of the whole. The movie also seemed to drag to me, when in the theatre. This version, though considerably longer doesn't drag at all. Like with the extended version of Fellowship, this extended version adds so much more that the story pushes itself along briskly, even though you are watching way more movie. Like with Fellowship extended version, this movie actually seems shorter and more coherent than the theatrical release was. And yes, the movie ends in the same place as it did before (no Shelob's cave at this point, and actually, I understand why; the great climax of the second book is really the victory of Helm's deep; much of the Shelob scene actually happens at the same time the world of men is actually attacking Mordor; the publisher really made a bad mistake dividing the book where he did) but are we ever aware of the evil infesting Gallum. Because of all the additional information we learn about him, and because we see the disintegration of Frodo's moral resolve far more clearly (and Sam is noticing it now, and he is beginning to understand the power of the ring), the closing scene is thrown into far greater relief than before; we know Gallum is seeking the complete ruin of everyone because of his lust for \\"the precious.\\" <br />If you don't like the Lord of the Rings, well, I am not sure you will like this version either. If you loved it, you will be blown away. If you enjoyed it but weren't completely impressed because too many things were not explained, you will really enjoy this version for you will follow the events more clearly and become involved with the emotions more fully.
0156027321|4.0|I was surprised to have found this book among quite a few other goodies piled in a box on the side of the road that said \\"Help Yourself\\" since I had heard its name mentioned so much and the copy was so new. I was even more surprised to see that the book had been awarded the Booker Award. I asked myself a few times on the way home: why was this book thrown out? <br />The story is of Piscine Molitor Patel (aka Pi) and the beginnings of his life up to the point where he gets stranded on a lifeboat with a 450 lb Bengal Tiger (and not much else) during his boat ride over to Canada. If anyone tries to tell you more about the plot, don't listen to them; that's all you need to know, and anymore is just giving away the story. I didn't even know that much about it when I started it and I enjoyed the book all the more for it. (So why am I telling you?... I don't know... ) <br />Absolutely bathed in religion (religions actually; Christianity, Muslim and Hindu), this is a good story told by a good story teller. I found it neither too deep nor too light, and virtually impossible to put down at times. Having recently studied Muslim and Hinduism in school, I found the references intriguing, beautiful and incredibly relevant to his journey across the Ocean. Check Yourwords dot ca for more about this review.<br />I don't recommend books to people, since there's no point (you can't guess someone else's tastes, you can just tell them if you liked it or not) but I can say with a great deal of certainty that no one would regret buying this book: the story is too well written and too uncontroversial to regret. <br />What I can say is this: Good story, well written, enjoyable, suspenseful at times, boring at times, but overall a really good book. It's left me thinking of a few things, trying to figure them out, but not too much; it's not an engaging or challenging novel, if that's what one is looking for. If that isn't what you want though, then it's probably perfect for you.
B00005B4GU|5.0|The brilliance of the melodic organization of deep bass beats and innovative musical arrangements that drop you into an abyssal trance of dark mood is beyond you're averge dummy understanding.  Which is why some people have found this album to be dissapointing. <br />However, this album is soothing and heartfelt, yet depressing lyrics and vocalizations that tear into your mind and induce tears with their vivid display of emotion pain and fury.  The songs seem to reach in and pull you out to embark on their journey of creativity and realization of the pain of life.  <br />This is by far the most dramatic and glorious album Radiohead has every produced.  It contains the most brilliant and risk-taking songs that are deserving of praise.  They did not falter under the influence of modern pop and rock and managed to be daring enough to adjust their style.  <br />An astounding improvement from the mediocre and substandard album The Bends, and has grew ever since Ok, Computer, and Kid A. Amnesiac takes you to the deepest areas of your mind and makes you feel every riff.  From the trip-hop like beats and moribund lyrics of The Pyramid Song, to the frustration and outcries of You and Who's Army, to the ambient and seemingly lost hope of The Morning Bells.  Nearly every song is excellent.  <br />This is not at all a positive album, but that is what makes it all the more beautiful.  That is what makes Radiohead the best rock group to date.  Their willing to be daring enough to stray from the normal, and to invent wonderful music free of cliche's and mediocrity, packed ful of deep poetry, that is dramatic and mind wrenching.  That is what music is suppose to do, be meaningful.
B0000E1WNV|3.0|Caught two shows during the Rising Tour... these DVDs accurately reflect the energy of the latest tour... video jumps around with multiple camera angles that while I found it really distracting in the NYC disks, for some reason it just didn't bother me as much here - I'm thinking the shot choices were better... However, I hate to say it - but the audio really has problems in 5.1... I've cranked it through a substantial HT and noticed distinct fadeouts of volume levels at sever junctures in the show...in particular the L and R front channels becomed under powered and the Center Channel fades in and out in a few spots (trust me, it's not the HT equipment)... I'm cautiously optimistic that perhaps this can be remedied in future releases of the product... I may try it in standard 2 channel to see if it sounds any better...
B000003TSP|2.0|In this second album, the vocals are more risky, and she takes chances with her voice, which is a good thing, meaning that the songs are more moving.  The bad thing is that her voice just sounds too terrible to enjoy with it sounding so horrible in every song. When every song sounds as if she is singing through a drive through fast food restaurant intercom, it is just appalling.  In the case of All Mine, and Only You, it is a perfect fit, being that the songs are about emotions run wild, and there is a need for such rawness.  If the beats and musical landscapes were good, even this would over shadow such terrible singing, but the music is mediocre and monotone.  After listening to the album a few more times, I still find that only these two songs alone are worth buying the CD at a bargin price.  Honestly, I don't understand why all of the hype and praise is given to Portishead.  Yes, their lyrics are their strong point, but one cannot live by lyrical content alone.  Some advice, buy Massive Attack or Hooverphonic if you are looking for an album with excellent trip-hop music.  Both of Portishead's albums aren't any where near as good as any of these.
B000003TA4|4.0|It's difficult to review \\"Nevermind\\" today since it has such an aura to it- of its 12 songs, 10 are now classics, and of course it was involved in such bigger things as the destruction of 80's pop and the beginning of the 90's rock boom that we still feel today.  In pure musical terms, \\"Nevermind\\" is still a great listen a full 12 years from its release date.  The Amazon.com reviewer probably said it right- it all sounds so familiar now just because millions of bands have tried hard to copy its style.  However, when this was released, it was something new, and had the full energy of a young band attached to it.<br />Looking past the immortal \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"Nevermind\\" has several other greats.  Every song flows together perfectly with the others, with every track standing out in its own way.  \\"Nevermind\\" lacks the pure raw emotion that drove its successor \\"In Utero\\", but this is great for a pure adrenaline head-banging album.  \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Come as You Are\\" could very well be two of the greatest rock singles ever.  Few bands could match the ferocity of \\"Territorial Pissings\\".  \\"Something in the Way\\" is as moving as it is haunting.  There are hidden gems on the album as well, such as \\"Drain You\\" and \\"Lounge Act\\".<br />The album's only possible flaw is that it can be a bit too melodic.  Especially near the end, the songs start to sound the same somewhat- \\"Nevermind\\" lacks the musical diversity of a Pearl Jam or Soundgarden album.  However, this is still a terrific recording, and worthy of its mantlepiece of one of rock'n'roll's most popular and immortal albums.<br />And finally I have a message for Pearl Jam and Nirvana fans.  I used to buy into the whole Pearl Jam-Nirvana rivalry (see my \\"In Utero\\" review), but it's really quite pointless.  They're both terrific bands and I respect them in different ways.  Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder ended the rivalry ten years ago (they were even going to play an MTV gig together at the end of 1993), so why it still continues amongst their fans I don't understand.  Reviewers like Nirvanadude and Nirvanadudeblows need to chill out.  Just listen to the rock, and love it or not- we have bigger enemies out there, like teenie boppers.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I got to experince this concert first hand, pretty close to the stage.. what a night.. and to be able to relive it with thte DVD is the best.  I say everyone should run out and buy this for everyone on your Christmas list.!
B00003CXDD|3.0|There are two parts of me that are fighting while I review &quot;Willow&quot;.  Part of me remembers how great this movie was when I was a kid, the great fun and wonder of it all, the terrific action sequences and (for then) innovative special effects.  The other part of me is the adult side, which realizes the movie's huge plot holes and blatant rip-offs.<br />First, the good things.  &quot;Willow&quot; really is a good-looking film for 1988, with beautiful set pieces, dark and ominous castles and evil armies, and innovative special effects.  It takes a while for the action in the film to get going, but once it does it really is quite riveting, especially the two castle battles near the end.  The swordplay in this is traditional (not Martial-Arts like modern films), but is very decent.  Val Kilmer gives an energy to his performance not seen in many of his modern films, and is very entertaining to watch.  Overall, this is just a very fun movie, both funny and suspenseful.<br />However, it has some major problems.  First, there are the plot holes.  Why does the baby have to be killed by an elaborate ritual instead of just being stabbed or something?  Because then how would have they written the script!?  Worst of all, it is apparent that this movie was the brain-child of George Lucas.  There's a difference between inspiration and blatant rip-off, and Lucas has always walked a fine line between those.  This movie raises the question: if you take from your own work, is it still called a rip-off?  Because &quot;Willow&quot; is primarily &quot;Star Wars&quot; set in the Medieval world.  It also draws heavily from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, which would be made into a far superior film a decade after &quot;Willow&quot;.  For good measure, it &quot;borrows&quot; from &quot;Snow White&quot; (the evil queen), &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; (Madmartigan's character and some of the stunts he pulls), &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (an army is turned into pigs), the Bible (an obvious Exodus-like beginning) and even &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (when Willow fights a possessed table).  To say there's not an original moment in &quot;Willow&quot; may not be much of an overstatement.<br />And so, I don't know what to think of &quot;Willow&quot; anymore.  The movie is still fun to watch, and I'm sure kids will enjoy it greatly.  It is a good looking film with a terrific score (possibly the best thing about Willow).  However, it also has some major problems and now is being paled by the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films.  I'll say I recommend it for a rental- I think the whole family can enjoy this one, even adults if they don't think too hard.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Picture seeing something so drastically terrifying that it constantly plays within the ring tones of your mind, terrorizing not only your waking thoughts but also your dreams. Now imagine that these were thoughts of a world where machines actually step past the point of being machines and not thinking, actually questioning their service to man, and where they decide that they aren't expendable anymore. Now picture knowing that this was not some form of fiction, having actually tasting the proof as it first tried to terminate you before you were born and then came for you again, when you were older, only in a different form. If you can grasp that straw, holding it in front of you and contemplating the way that would taste, then you can somewhat understand the life that John Conner has been living. Still, that's all in the past, right? After the Governator went back in time and saved us all from the horrors of Skynet and the machines taking over in T-2, everything was fine. Well, not quite.<br />I went into T-3 perhaps not expecting a lot, but I was hoping that my 174 million dollar budget would perhaps deliver a punch that would top the last two installments. It seemed possible considering the lineup, with Arnold at the helm and a creative special effects team backing it. And it did that, too. Unfortunately, the amount of effects and bringing Arnold back into the fray for another round were two of the problems the movie suffered from and that took away from throwing me over the top.<br />This isn't to say that the house wasn't brought down in parts with those effects, because some of those wonders were amazing to behold. Watching all the little pieces of destruction, the carnage upon carnage, was interesting - at first. I actually liked the amount of sheer destruction and cold-blooded killing that happened, some of those scenes MASSIVE entertaining, but then the storyline started trying to work me back to Skynet and I kept thinking that I've already been here and done that. In fact, I had watched it quite a few times and was assured that Skynet would be brought down.  And then it started looking a lot like T-2 again, the thing chasing perhaps a LOT better looking but still an upgrade, and I kept noticing little flaws here and there. Yes, in some parts the effects were REALLY noticeable, not burying themselves smoothly enough. Some places actually looked blurred, with the size of the body being flung a little off or the digital blur not exactly human or machine enough, making you think of one word. Cheap. In a 172 million dollar film, I shouldn't ever think that. Still, some other stuff - the use of a crane and some of those lovely Terminator models coming to life - made up for that.<br />The second flaw was Arnold and his delivery. While nobody would say that he is expected to give a stellar job as the Terminator, I expect certain things. No emotions would be one, no yelling instead of taking his all-too-lovingly murderous time is another, and he did both of these a little herein. He didn't exactly seem motivated, like he knew his money was in the bag and that he didn't have to work for it, and that was somewhat annoying. The moves weren't done as well this time around, almost as if he was jogging through the motions and not putting his all into the film, and I found myself annoyed and looking to the back-up actors/actresses. A Terminator movie and I found myself drifting because of the Terminator! That honestly took a lot away from my experience and was a shame, too. Its a good thing the rest of the cast pulled it back from the edge.<br />I suppose it depends on what you want out of this film. If you want the redundant heartbeat recaptured for you, letting you experience T-2 with a darker ending, then this would be something you would like. If you can ignore some of Arnold in it, letting the little glitches in the persona get by you, then its all the better. As much as I complain about it and point out the negative aspects, Istill see the result as something to watch a few times, noting the newer machines and the wholesale death being rained upon the stage. Honestly, its hard for me to tire of that effect.<br />Also, the Sgt. Candy scene, the only deleted piece besides the gag reel, did actually make me laugh and gave the T-1 models a little backstory. So, there was something here besides a lot of mayhem.I still see the result as something to watch a few times, noting the newer machines and the wholesale death being rained upon the stage.

B00000K19E|5.0|\\"No one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.\\" says Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the earnest, elegant John the Baptist figure in the Wachowski brothers' allegorical science fiction masterpiece. Well, we'll give it a shot. <br />He's talking to Neo (Keanu Reeves), a blank-faced computer whizz who's about to go through the looking glass - out of the late 20th century world as he knows it, into the real, post-apocalyptic \\"desert of the real\\".<br />It's a reality where robots rule the planet and keep humans plugged into a virtual reality matrix, living in a dream world, while their energy fuels the machines. <br />Morpheus thinks Neo is The One, the messiah figure who will destroy the Matrix and resurrect humanity. Fellow freedom fighter Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is convinced too. But Neo isn't certain, and will have to face the pernicious, powerful, Matrix meanie Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) to find out. <br />At first viewing, the action sequences stun, but there's more to this than the groundbreaking \\"bullet time\\" photography, or the adolescent allure of flash, black clothes and big, black guns. <br />Sure, \\"The Matrix\\" is almost untenably cool, but beneath the sheen there's substance. The story's a potent mix of buddhism, Greek mythology, and - predominantly - the Christian gospel. <br />The image of a superficial existence, where ignorant people thrive by blocking out a troublesome reality, is potent for a Western society drowning in wealth while the rest of the world suffers. <br />The performances, too, wow. Admittedly Reeves is gifted the perfect role - he has to look good while hitting things - but Moss is charismatic, clever and sexy, while Fishburne is monumental.<br />Nestling next to \\"The Terminator\\" and \\"Metropolis\\", this is one the finest sci-fi flicks ever made.<br />What is \\"The Matrix\\"? It's genius. And yes, we admit, you do have to see it for yourself.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|It's crazy because I've been a fan of Britney since her first album came out. I remember buying the Baby One More Time single when I was only about 11 or so. I loved it, and I've been a fan ever since. It's hard to stay a fan of Britney though, because she is constantly getting criticized for something & people turn against her. But I love her. She's an amazing dancer, she comes up with the best ideas for her videos & she's a damn good performer. When In The Zone came out, I listened to it for months & it was all I listened to. I love this CD. It's grown up, it's fun & it's got something on here for everyone. There's fun dance songs like \\"Boom Boom\\", \\"Toxic\\" & \\"The Hook Up\\". The more serious songs like \\"Shadow\\" & \\"Everytime\\". And the sexy controversial songs like \\"Touch of My Hand\\" & \\"Breathe On Me\\". The production on this album is flawless. Britney made some amazing songs on this one. I think it's her best yet. \\"Shadow\\" is beautiful. I'm in love with that song still! \\"Breathe On Me\\" takes me to another place when I hear it. And then there's \\"Everytime\\" which Britney wrote herself at her piano...it's one of her best ballads. It's hauntingly beautiful. Britney may not have the best voice anymore, but she's not the worst. She's got the talent to stick around for alot longer. She's made it this far with 4 #1 albums! I can't wait for her new album. She's working with more great producers & she's taking her time...it's gonna be a great record worth waiting for.

B00007L4MJ|4.0|I won't repeat what others have already said about the historical significance of this film or its contents.  I do want to share my opinions about the Kino restoration vs the Moroder version.<br />I already owned the Moroder version when I purchased the Kino restoration on DVD.  Like many others, I was amazed at the incredible visual clarity of the Kino restoration when compared to the Moroder version, as others have said it looks like it was shot yesterday, not 70+ years ago.  Also, seeing it with a performance of the original score provided a different experience.<br />Some of the other differences are:<br />1. The Kino version contains some footage missing from the Moroder version, but not a lot more.  The scene that stands out most for me is the first scene in Frederson's office - we gain a better understanding of how hard he works and how much he expects from those below him, so the firing of Josephat and Josaphat's reaction makes more sense than it does in the Moroder version.  Another scene that is significantly different is the first meeting between Frederson and Rotwang - their rivalry is portrayed in greater depth in the Kino restoration, although it is also perfectly clear in the Moroder version.<br />2. Many `purists' have complained about the music in the Moroder version.  I disagree, I think that the music and the lyrics greatly enhance the emotional impact of the Moroder version.  Don't misunderstand, I think the original orchestral score as presented in the Kino version is great, but words and music together are far more powerful than either alone.<br />3. The story is a bit different.  Personally, I think that the story as presented in the Moroder version makes more sense, why would Frederson want his workers to revolt?  But this is his motivation for having Rotwang create the machine-man in the Kino restoration.<br />4. Many `purists' complain about the colorization in the Moroder version.  I admit, there were places where I found it a bit jarring,but overall I think it adds to the emotional tone of the film.  Still, I think the Kino restoration is valuable for what it is, a restoration.<br />The point I am trying to make is this.  The Kino restoration is an incredible piece of work that will be of great value to all who wish to experience as much of the original film as is possible today.  But, in my opinion the Moroder version, with its modern lyrical score is also of great value, maybe not as much in a historical context but as a separate film experience.  Think of the Moroder version as a new work based on an old work, not as a restoration.<br />My recommendation?  See them both, but see the Moroder version first, the Kino version second.  Otherwise, you'll be distracted by the degraded video quality in the Moroder version and you'll miss the incredible soundtrack.  Someday when home computers become more powerful and video production software is cheaper and easier to use I'll probably dub the Moroder soundtrack to the Kino video and have the best of both worlds.  Until then, the Moroder video isn't that bad, it is about what you would expect from a 70+ year old silent film, but the Kino video, in comparison, is incredible.<br />And, by the way, the Japanese animated film produced a couple of years ago bears only the most superficial resemblance to the original, I was seriously disappointed.
0743201140|1.0|This is a follow-on to &quot;First, Break All The Rules&quot;<br />I paid for the new book, but it arrived without the code required to conduct that partnered web profile.  Amazon initially said I would have to contact the publisher for resolution, although from the generic nature of the reply I doubt my customer service request was even read by a human.  <br />Eventually, a real person contacted me and sent a replacement/exchange.  <br />This book did not have the same systematic rigor as its predecessor. There was no clear relationship between the many strengths that were listed.  It would have been very useful if there was some kind of comparison table or a taxonomic tree/flow chart that relates the strengths.  It was also unclear how the ?talents? of the first book related to the ?strengths? of this book. <br />All that said, these two books represent the ONLY business study I would consider scientific.  I do not know of another study that looked at average or poor performers and compared them with the top performers to find the real differences.
B00005JLYW|4.0|So then why do I only give it 4 out of 5 stars?  It's because of the DVD version. I couldn't tell any difference between the unrated version and the theatrical version. It seems like the unrated title was slapped onto the cover just so more copies would sell. Anyway, on with the review: As I said in my title, Full Throttle definately lives up to it's predecessor. The returning characters in Full Throttle are Bosley who this time is played by Bernie Mac, which I prefered him as Bosley over Bill Murray and the Thin Man played again by Crispin Glover from the first movie. Demi Moore does a good job playing the sexy villain. The new disguieses and the motorcyle race are also a plus. I can't believe the number of people who gave negative reviews towards this movie! In my opinion, Full Throttle is one of many examples on how sequels aren't always a bad idea. As for specail features on the DVD, the unrated and theatrical version aren't much different.
B00005JXY3|2.0|When John G. Avildsen's &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; was a smash hit, the fact that a sequel would be made was inevitable. Perhaps even a trilogy would form. A totally unnecessary trilogy, but a trilogy nevertheless. Well, there were three sequels made - &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II,&quot; &quot;The Karate Kid, Part III,&quot; and &quot;The Next Karate Kid,&quot; each installment worse than the last entry.<br />The point of the first movie was stressed clearly without becoming too overbearing. Violence is wrong. Right, right, right - we've heard it before. Of course, self-defense is fine when used correctly, but nonsensical violence is criminally and morally wrong.<br />That's sort of forgotten in &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II,&quot; which stumbles along and runs into major problems. One, the script - it's weak. Two, the acting - it's stiff. Three, the actual story and scenes within the film - all idiotic. Take, for example, the end of the film, when a Chinese girl is performing some ancient dance and a disowned martial arts expert swings from the top of the stadium down a cable, landing next to the girl and holding a knife to her throat. &quot;Behind you!&quot; Daniel (Ralph Macchio) yells helplessly as he jumps into the sand pit before him and proceeds to battle the martial artist. (Is that a word? And what's the difference between martial arts and karate? Never mind, don't answer that.)<br />No one offers any sort of help as Daniel is beaten to a bloody pulp. None whatsoever. They just sit around and watch with fixated smiles on their faces, forgetting that their characters call for them to be scared and not to be happy that they are getting not even fifteen minutes of fame out of the deal.<br />A small complaint? Perhaps, but pretty much all of the film contains these children's fantasy ideas that a boy such as Daniel may dream of during his sleep. In fact, perhaps this sequel is all one big hallucination - perhaps Daniel, after a tough karate match, was knockedout. He's laying in a hospital, dazed and confused, unconscious and lost in a deadly coma. It's the easiest way to create a half-baked sequel, so pay attention, scriptwriters.<br />Daniel has gone back to Mr. Miyagi's (&quot;Pat&quot; Morita) country of origin, China, and now he's getting into fights with an old adversary of Mr. Miyagi. There's not much more to tell you than that - unless, of course, you would like to know that the mandatory girlfriend appears for Daniel (a Chinese chick, of course), and that the adversary's niece is Daniel's foe.<br />Great stuff.<br />Not.<br />I really liked the first &quot;Karate Kid&quot; movie, but this is pushing it. The third film was absolutely appalling, the fourth a total mess. The second is below average and quite mediocre. I'd call it an uncredited rip-off of &quot;Rocky&quot; if not for the fact that the director of the film, John G. Avildsen, happens to be the director of &quot;Rocky,&quot; among other films. His expertises are these underdog flicks. Unfortunately, despite having a strong predecessor and possible character developments in store, &quot;The Karate Kid, Part II,&quot; offers nothing new to the series. And, needless to say, either will the following two sequels.<br />Ralph Macchio is fine, Pat Morita is still the same, but the film is too goofy and unreal to appreciate. It's a weak example of filmmaking. It's not even that fun to watch - whereas the first film sort of had the viewer attached to the screen, this one makes you want to walk away and not pay attention to it at all.<br />Perhaps the only positive thing to say about this movie is that it is the best of the sequels. But that's really not saying very much at all, is it?

B00004TRD8|5.0|If you are wondering whether you should buy the Ultimate or Extreme edition of Terminator 2, the right choice to make in the Ultimate Edition. It has nearly 4 hours of extra content, while the Extreme edition has about 4 minutes of bonus features. The Extreme edition says that it has a much better transfer (picture &amp; sound), but it really doesn't. You have got to be one hell of a nerd with one hell of an entertainment system to tell a scrap of difference. Besides, the Ultimate edition has DTS, unlike the Extreme. The only good thing about the Extreme edition that you can't get in the Ultimate edition is the audio commentary from James Cameron. The commentary on the Ultimate edition seems a bit thrown together, but is that really all that important. The Ultimate edition is by far the best choice to make in buying this flat-out incredible flick.

Naked&quot; only improves.  &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; has never sounded better, and Harrison's &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot; got a tune up.  The sound has also greatly improved, and will make you wonder why they haven't remastered the group's other great albums.  <br />This is definetly a worthy purchase, but don't expect a whole new album.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I was not a huge fan of Britneys until I heard \\"I'm a Slave For You\\" and even then I was only into that song.  \\"In The Zone\\" finds Britney at her sexy best.  The song \\"Toxic\\" is one of the best dance pop songs of the decade.  \\"I've Got That (BOOM BOOM) is equally addictive.  \\"Outrageous\\" gives Beyonce a run for the real queen of pop.  She does not have a beautiful voice but neither did early Madonna. What she does have is star quality.  Whether you like it or not Britney is the pop icon of today. She is what Madonna, Prince, and the Jackson siblings were yesterday. I Like It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Wow the first time i heard this guy i got chills down my spine.  now, every time i listen to him, i still get those chills.  his musical talent is flawless and when he sings, he puts his voice out there like no other, which is so hard to find in guys nowadays. i went out and bought his cd immediately and there is not one song on this cd that i do not like.  gavin degraw is an extremely gifted and spectacular kind of person, and i am so excited to hear more and more about him in the future!! two very enthusiastic thumbs up! cheers to you gavin!
B000002KKS|5.0|It's difficult to believe this release is 23 years old. To me, the recording is as fresh as it was when I first purchased it many years ago. Every song is top notch and production first rate. <BR>My purpose for anyone who reads this is to try to find the import CD of &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; on Gimcastle/Castle Communications. This version has been remastered and a nice booklet featuring the song lyrics and rarely seen photos of the band circa 1980 (although I'm not sure why the photo that was originally in the gatefold of the &quot;Paranoid&quot; album is here). <BR>Note to Warner Brothers records: So you want induce people to buy music and not download it, then take your profits and update this release!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Way too cheap for what they are. I didn't fully realize this until I got a player with a lot of equalization choices. Then I discovered that the changes didn't make much difference in the way the music sounded in all the various earphones I had around the house (because they didn't have enough frequency response to manipulate), except these. Everyone I've shown them to has loved them. <br />The comfort issue someone else mentioned is real--it takes a while to build up the calluses to use them for really long periods of time, and you can't use them lying on your side. But it's worth it.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I became a huge Neil Young fan in 1987 through friends who had the old well-known classics like 'Everybody Knows...' and 'Decade'. Discovering Neil's back catalogue at that time was a thrilling adventure. One by one, I discovered and fell in love with his albums Goldrush, Rust Never Sleeps, Comes a Time,  Tonight's The Night, and so on. I soon found myself searching record stores for the less popular albums, and I scooped up everything (including the rare Journey Through the Past soundtrack). It's been damn wonderful.<br />I came across 'On The Beach&quot; about 2 years into this Neil binge, and it was one of the last albums I found. I had never heard of it. It was a vinyl copy sitting in a used record store bin. Getting it home and putting it on the turntable, I just stood in shock listening to this album. I couldn't believe that I had never heard of this after so many trips to so many stores. No other Neil fans I talked to had heard the record either. What a travesty.<br />This is one of those records that stays with you. It haunts you, it may wake you up in the middle of the night and keep you awake. It's somewhat pessimistic, but leaves the door open for some optimism. This remastering job has made this recording sound wonderfully warm and intimate, so even if by some miracle you have the vinyl, you ought to pick up this CD. And I would agree that this is one of his very best albums - cohesive, effective, and very satisfying.<br />I won't bother with a critiquing of each song since so many have done so already, but side 2 in particular is great listening at 4 in the morning, and you can almost feel the sun come up at the end.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|In the early 70's, un-Spectorized versions of this album were played on the radio, and when the Beatles CD's were released in the mid-80's, I had the impression that the release of something like this was imminent. Wrong. Finally, while some of us who were there are still alive, we have this CD.<br />Glad as I am to own it, the hype has been a bit much. Maybe it's that these aren't their best songs. Maybe it's that after 30-some years of listening to the Spectorized album, I'm so used to it that my original repugnance for the overproduction has faded. But while this is an obvious essential for the serious Beatles fan, I didn't find much more pleasure in it than in the sometimes-interesting alternate takes of earlier and better songs from the Rubber Soul/Revolver period on the Anthology CD's.<br />Buy it, but don't buy the hype about its being a spectacular improvement in terms of artistry or sound quality. It's nicely done, and it will replace the original CD for the most part when I'm in a &quot;Let It Be&quot; mood; that will just be rare for me as it has always been.  If, however, you're a big fan of these particular songs, give it 5 stars and then some - I think you'll love hearing them closer to the way at least some of the Beatles originally intended them to sound.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King, in my opinion, is one of Disney's best films. It's an animated, youthful, and modernized adaptation of Hamlet:<br />The King (of the jungle) is murdered by his jealous brother, Scar, who takes over as King by running the young heir of the throne (and his nephew), Sinba out of the Jungle by convincing him that HE was the one who killed his father.<BR>A young Simba leaves behind his freinds, family, and home in shame and creates a new life for himself with two new friends, Pumba and Timon, who teach him how to survive on bugs and a carefree lifestyle: &quot;Hakuna Matata!&quot; But, years later, Simba is discovered and revealed as the living heir to the throne which was stolen from his father. Now he must go back to the past which haunts him and face the uncle that took his life away from him and reclaim his true destiny as the King of the Jungle.<br />This is a fantastic movie with wonderfully catchy songs (by Elton John and Tim Rice)and a great story line. It's funny, heartwarming -and in the tradition of all Disney movies - has a great ending! <BR>I don't recommend this movie for kids under the age of 6, though. There are some scenes that younger kids find scary, not to mention that there are some graphic scenes (violence, and especially the scene in which Scar murders his brother Mufasa).<BR>But over the age 6, I recommend for everyone!<BR>If you are a Disney or DVD collector, you MUST own this DVD!

0385508417|5.0|This was a laugh-out-loud book. I have read many Grisham books and was not expecting the humor. Towards the end of the book the story turned so funny it reminded me of the Tom Hanks movie, &quot;The Burbs.&quot; This book can be read in one long night...you don't want to put it down. I loved the twist at the end! I plan to give this book to many on my Christmas list...not skipping it this year!
B0000E1WNV|4.0|The show itself deserves five stars, it's truly incredible.  The ecstatic audience are the kind of crowd performers dream of.    The sound quality is not as good as it should be.  It lacks the clarity and fullness of the Live In NYC DVD.  For this reason, I'm only giving this DVD four stars.    Crank it and sing your heart out.
0061015725|4.0|First off, let me say that while I am not a horror fan, this book could easily be fitted into that genre.  Add a star if you like your horror plausible.<br />As far as the negative reviews, maybe they should go back and re-read the book.  The main character is indeed a programmer who is now too old to write code.  That doesn't mean he isn't a programmer any more.  As far as the rabit scene, which seems to be a major stumbling block, well rabbits are small creatures, humans are larger.  Get over it.<br />As far as the explanations, all I can say is, if you read any Tom Clancy you are used to long explanations.  If you read the explanations you understand why, maybe not immediately, but further on in the book.  This is called setting up a plot device.  Those people who didn't understand why the main character was called out to the site didn't read the explanations, they only skimmed them.<br />If you want to have a no-brainer read, go elsewhere.<br />If you want to wonder about what is being cooked up in labs behind closed doors, and how it can affect the human race, this is the book for you.<br />Go ahead, skip the latte at the coffee shop and spend the cash on this book instead, you won't be sorry.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is a great film, as I've seen it numerous times and it keeps getting funnier every single time I see it. I'm a big Tom Hanks fan, but I would like to see him more films such as this one where he can showcase his comedic talents. I highly recommend this film!
B000053VAF|5.0|I would give this movie 5 stars just based on the research alone that Kevin Smith had to have done for this film. All of his characters (names mostly relating to biblical days) and back story are nothing short of brilliant. <BR>The story is about two fallen angels (Matt Damon, Ben Affleck) who have been cast out of heaven and forced to live in Wisconsin until the end of existance for giving God the finger. When the two find a loophole in the catholic religion, which would allow them to re-enter heaven, thus by proving that God isn't perfect, all hell breaks loose -literally! Demons come up from hell to make sure that the two angels suceed in their mission which will be the cause of the end of the world. The demons incapacitate God in the body of a comatosed human and are off to help existance cease to exist. In an attempt to stop them, The Voice of God tracks down Bethany - an abortion clinic worker- and convinces her that it's her job to stop the two angels thus by saving all of humanity. And Jay an Silent Bob (What would a Kevin Smith movie be without those two?) are sent with her as two very unlikely prophets, along with the thirteenth apostle (who was left out of the bible for being black!), played by Chris Rock. So now the clock is ticking. Bethany and her gang must get to New Jersey before the two angels have a chance to walk through the archway of forgiveness which would allow them to re-enter heaven. <BR>This movie is full of classic Kevin Smith humor, a great plot, and an amazing cast: Chris Rock, Alan Rickman, Ben Affleck, Kevin Smith, Matt Damon, Salma Hayek, George Carlin, Alanis Morissette, and more). <BR>It is an intelligent and hilarious fantasy film. You don't have to be religious to understand or like this movie! Highly Recommended!

0385334206|5.0|Breakfast of Champions is Kurt Vonnegut at his finest.  Instead of his usual attempt to focus around a central theme, Vonnegut attacks everything American in BofC. Critics argue that the novel lacks the depth of his other books.  On the contrary, he is quite thorough, albeit he forces the reader to think a bit on his or her own without anything being spelled out.  This leaves the reader pondering Vonnegut's insightful remarks for weeks afterwards.  When someone recommends classic Vonnegut, they usually say Slaughterhouse 5.  I think they should reconsider and move this novel to the top of their list.

B00004XOWM|1.0|I cannot stand Fred Durst. He is a stupid,corny,idiotic poser. He tries to rap on these rock records and he sound pathetic. I can't believe Limp Bizkit has gotten this far. They are quite possibly the cr@ppiest band of the 90's into 2000. Everybody kisses Wes Borland's @ss, but he can't compare to guitarists like Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello. This is the bottomline. Fred Durst is an idiotic poser. Limp Bizkit is a wannabe nu-metal band that makes pop-rock &quot;music&quot; for Top 40 stations and MTV (&quot;This is Fred Diggity Durst yo, live on TRL!&quot; - Fred Durst - retard). This is not rock. Or metal. Or even genuine rap-rock. This is what gives rap-rock a bad name. I can't stand this group and everytime I hear Fred Durst's voice I wanna bash his stupid, poser face in. He needs to go back to stalking women on his website that he has absolutely no chance with. This is not music.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Mike Meyers is the voice of Shrek: an ugly yet endearing ogre who is sent on daring quest with the help of his loudmouthed donkey friend (brilliantly named Donkey, voice by Eddie Murphy) to rescue the somewhat annoying and feisty princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) by the evil spirited Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), who is too much of a chicken to do it himself. He promises Shrek the deed to his beloved swamp back in exchange for the Princess. But, this journey gives Shrek a lot more than he EVER bargained for: friends, introspection, and love!!!<BR>I love this movie and I love that my kids love this movie! During the course of the movie it is revealed that there is a spell on Princess Fiona - during the day she is a beautiful princess - but as soon as the sun sets, she is turned into a very much less attractive ogre. She is mortified by this and tries to keep it a secret, but by the end of the movie she realizes that beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder, but it truly is what lies within. I love that the movie sends this message out to young girls -- with so many movies out there that tell girls that they have to be beautiful or change who they are to be accepted (i.e. Grease, The Princess Diaries, Ms. Congeniality, etc.)... I'm glad to see that there is a movie out there that lets girls know that it's okay to be who you are and to be proud! <BR>I recommended this movie for everyone!<BR>And the DVD-Rom has a really fun feature for kids that lets them dub their voices to the characters lines exactly! It keeps kids entertained for hours!
6303020062|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE HARRISON FORD AT HIS BEST
0140284095|5.0|You know things are going bad for Gussie (Agustus Fink-Nottle) when Bertie steps in to lend a able hand in his affairs..<BR>The premise of this ridiculously funny book is simple, Gussie has fallen in love with Madeline Basset, friend of Bertie's cousin Angela, who (Angela) has quarelled with her lover and Bertie's longtime friend (the episode at the Drones notwithstanding) Tuppy Glossop over the matter of the latter not acknowledging the former's tryst with a shark at Cannes. Simple enough right? Take all these people and confine them in a country house, add a liberal dashing of Aunt Dahlia and that man of intellect Jeeves, not to mention a few assorted cooks and uncles, and you have a tale of horror (for Bertie) or a tale of absolute joy for the rest of us. <BR>When helping convey Gussie's love to Madeline, Bertie convices Madeline that he loves her too. So when Madeline falls out with Gussie, she comes running to Bertie, who would rather she not. Tuppy, is also convinced that some low-lying snake has stolen Angela from him, and thinking that this l.l.s is Gussie. Gussie, meanwhile, to brace himself for the gruelling task of presenting the prizes in the Market Snodsbury school (for which he is down at Brinkley Court) tanks up on alchohol, and threatens to sully the Wooster name in a gathering of Market Snodsbury's finest. When the going gets tough, the tough ring for Jeeves. Can the man save the hour and untangle this absolute mess?<BR>This is one of Wodehouses's finest Jeeves books. I say that in a different way in every review of mine, but I cant help it. The man is so good! If you cannot read this book in its entirety (shame on you!) just read the description of Gussie presenting the prizes. That one chapter will brighten your day, suffuse you in a radiant light of good cheer and make you feel that life is one great glad song. <BR>Don't miss this book. It's an absolute ringer!
0671015206|5.0|Great book for anyone from high school to middle age.  High schoolers may use it to help determine their future careers.
0553277472|5.0|I recommend this book highly. It is an excellent book, although I would agree with other reviewers that it is not an easy read.  A man's quest for the definition of quality was of most interest. I found the underlying story of a difficult relationship between a man and his son interesting, but the author definitely teaches the reader a lot more about quality than parenting.  With regards to quality, while I did not feel that Pirsig was totally successful in defining quality, he was right on target when he defined it's source.  The core message and fundamental heart of the book was Pirsig's commentary relative to quality coming from people who care.  Peace of mind according to the author is not superficial to technical work (and this could be extended to all types of work), it is really all that matters.  It is produced by good work and destroyed by bad work. Specifications, measuring instruments, etc. are all tools to help satisfy the peace of mind of those doing the work.  Knowing that the people who did the job care about what they are doing gives one the peace of mind that quality work has been accomplished and that a quality product has been made.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Reign of fire has gotten much criticism for its lack of storyline and so on.  But when you think about it... what is a movie made for.  Does it have to have a story?  Does it have to have good acting?  If your a dumba** and you don't know the answer, it's NO.  A movie is supposed to be entertaining.  And if you don't think massive fire breathing dragons are entertaining, then you must be stupid... cuz it is.

B000062YAZ|5.0|great album. never get tired of listening to it. the 80's produced some of the best music if you exclude lame hair bands. definately buy this album, you wont regret it
B0000035E7|3.0|(Three out of five stars)...<br />I had originally owned Bleach on LP, and the crunchy guitar and bass definitely feel more appropriate on vinyl with all of its hisses and pops more than it does on the thin, digitally-remastered CD re-release. To put it simply: Vinyl gives any music more body and fullness, and with a batch of songs recorded for $600, the songs off Bleach need all the fullness they can get. For the Nevermind and In Utero fans: Bleach is nothing like what you're used to. Even the most punk-influended In Utero recordings can't prepare you for the dirge of Bleach. No songs on Bleach are anywhere near punk. They're plodding, lurching muckfests, each and every last one (even About a Girl is quite mucky in terms of sound). I don't consider this bad, but if you aren't familiar with Bleach, you'll be shocked with how dull it is. There. I said it since nobody else would. It's dull. But since I like my Nirvana less frantic and less Teen Beat, I'm fine with it. Nowadays, I'd rather hear Sifting than anything off Nevermind anyway. Bleach-era songs are much slower, and bleaker than the everything Nirvana did after 1990. Many people commonly say their favourites are along the lines of Blew, School, Negative Creep, Love Buzz, and About a Girl, but I reckon those are just the Nevermind fans trying to find Nirvana's most accessable bits to hang onto. A few people mentioned Paper Cuts as a great song, but honestly, it's one of their worst without question. The song has no chorus and no melody. However, the reason I don't like it is because of what it's about. Quite scary. As for my faves: Scoff (for the jaded alcoholic in all of us), Sifting (love the lines on the preacher), Swap Meet (about a couple who love cigarettes and photographs), and Downer.<br />Peace out, hippies!
B00008S2VG|2.0|I think Madonna's best albums are her first 2 and her last 2 before this one...  I had mega expectations for this album after Music, Ray of light, Frozen et al. and was a bit shocked and disappointed when I heard American life for the first time.  Some of the traxx are decent - Love Profusion, Hollywood, Mother and Father - but they are a bit too mundane, repetitive and interrupted with raps and inane lyrics that make me cringe and are a bit embarrassing for such an accomplished star.  Sometimes a creative mis-step leads to an incredible comeback, which is what I'm hoping.  Madonna has a lot of other far better records in her repertoire.
B0000027RL|5.0|By far this is the best cd that came out of the grunge era and possible the 90's.  In fact i would rate this cd one of the top five ever created in the history of all music. I am not just saying this because its pearl jam and i listen to them.  (i only own 3 of thier cds, so its not like i am obsessed with them)<br />Anyways why is this so great?<br />first of all this cd was the best thing that happened to the world to get us out of the horrible metal crap through the late 70's - 80's. This includes metallica, iron maiden, and any hair bands, and Zeppelin too. I hate Zeppelin with a passion. Yes they are talented but they sound is awful especially the robert plants singing.  To move on.......<br />This cd has such great music with very talent musicians. Listen to Mike solo in the song Alive or Why Go, damn you would think slash (GNR) got lessons for mike. <br />The only other cd i can think of now at such a late hour that comes close to this experice is<br />Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd<br />the end..
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was blown away by this cd. I was expecting a cd with 1 or 2 good songs on it but i was shocked upon hearing every single song being a hit! <BR>My favorite songs are: Showdown, Toxic, Touch of My Hand, Brave New Girl and Everytime. Though every song was AMAZING!<br />By the way: I am usually not a fan of Britney's but this cd has totally made me a True Fan...
0062502174|5.0|I found this book in a bookstore.  I walked through the fiction section as I always do looking and reading different covers of novels.  Never have I heard of an alchemist when I stopped in front of this novel, and the art on the jacket was beautiful. I wondered what kind of book was this, and I bought it.<br />I am so glad that I did.  I've learned an important lesson from reading this book.  Dreams can be attained.  Personal goals are within our reach, but we have to be willing to be brave, to be patient, and to love.<br /><br />The boy in this book did amazing things to achieve what he wanted.  He was just as I wrote before:  brave, patient, and loving in his quest to reach his goal.  The entire journey was breathtaking and unbelieveable, and if it was real and if it was me, I would have said forget it.  Who needs to go through all that?  But he kept on, the boy kept going, and at the end, it wasn't easy then either.  But he did it.<br />This novel is amazing!  I absolutely loved it.  Paulo Coelho has gained another fan.  Brilliant work.  Enjoy.<br />Joy
B00005JMFI|5.0|At first,I did'nt think this movie would be good at all,Especially in the begging.But,when it got into the middle of the movie me and my friend started to laugh,Especially when he gets run over by a car!!I recommend this movie to everybody,even the soundtrack.Kids and grownups will laugh at elf(Will Ferrell)and his hillarious sense of humor.When Will wants to find his dad,he realized he is in the nauty list.Will tries to cheer his dad up with his hallarious sense of humor.I think this is a very good movie and whoever thinks their too cool for this movie but think they are good enough for Yu Gi Oh(might be spelling mistake)they are wrong.this is a good movie that both kids and grownups will like that I have seen in years.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I am a huge Britney fan.  I bought her new CD and expected the same pop tween type of songs.  This is a very mature, upbeat, better Britney CD.  She explores a variety of styles and and isn't afraid to sing her heart out.  The song \\"Showdown\\" is a great way to get back at Justin.  And I love \\"Breathe on Me.\\"  It's a very sensual, sexual CD.  Move over Christina, Britney is moving on up.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|As with most, I have followed Dream Theater for some time, and have purchased every one of their albums. That being said, this latest effort is worth a listen. I don't think it is as good as Metropolis Part II in content, nor as progressive as Awake, but is far better then the sell out of Falling Into Infinity or the dissappointing Six Degrees. The first track, &quot;As I Am&quot; is for every individual who is tired of living in this age of corporate conformity. The last track, &quot;In the Name of God&quot;, is another in a line of songs where DT has taken a political position and written about it, without dictating what is right or wrong. Similar to &quot;The Great Debate&quot; from Six Degrees, DT has tackled the subject of religious fanatics and how the Holy Word is twisted to fit human desires.<br />The only true dissappointment on this album is the ballad, &quot;Vacant&quot;. It is short (thankfully), but lacks anything that will reach out and hold the listener. The instrumental &quot;Stream of Conciousness&quot; is classic Dream Theater, giving every player an opportunity to showcase their talent. <br />Overall, this album is worth the price, but don't expect any ground breaking advances in the progressive metal genre from it.
B000067FP7|4.0|Footnote: Official Actual Review: **** 1/4 stars (four and a quarter star rating)<br />In the summer of 1984 as Ivan Reitman's ceaselessly beloved supernatural box-office comedic powerhouse Ghostbusters was prevailingly netting all the profuse blockbuster revenues and inestimably enshrining itself adamantly with adoring audiences across all divides as the year's principally paramount money rainmaker of the year, a minor monster film B-Movie tribute to Capracorn and 1950's space paranoia exploitation flicks came into circulation at around the same time. Internationally released to movie theaters around the globe, Gremlins was an unappeasably premeditative liberating commandeering of the world's silver screens in one fell swoop of cinematic amnesty from the norm. Unhesitatingly conspiring and invigoratingly procuring to unhesitatingly unleash a mischievous torrent of cantankerously inconsolable scaly adversarial devils wantonly assailing restrained movie tastes with the provocatively stimulating rousing sensationalism of maliciously volatile foresight. Joe Dante's phenomenally lucrative massively unfashionable bold creative re-imaging of the exploitation genre sensationally ran amok with the general public as it universally grossed resoundingly beyond anyone's comprehension and beguilingly entranced millions more into an atypical personal connection with the film.<BR> <BR>Dexterously consolidating into a whole new age of pop cultural advertising packaging integrating (beginning with Star Wars and exploding with E.T.), Gremlins was principally choked with indefinite unattributable mountains of merchandise. The Gizmo doll, Gremlin action figures, Gremlin lunch boxes, Gremlin posters, Gremlin story-time audio cassettes (do you remember those?) and all sorts of other cherished child and adult paraphernalia that became incredibly dispensed at an glaringly astronomical pace. Yet at the heart of this significant immeasurable love affair with the Gremlins and it's essential myth, lies ultimately the film itself. After nearly twenty years and untold droves of imbecilic rehashes, moronic re-shoots, and Kindergarten retreads, the film remains an indisputable pop culture cinematic touchstone classic of the 1980's. Directed by cinematic maverick satirist Joe Dante (Gremlins 2: The New Batch, The Howling, Looney Tunes: Back In Action) and executive produced by the omnipresent commercial dynamo of the 1980's Steven Spielberg, Gremlins is the uncanniest ironclad combination of subversive divine parody (Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life) and thrillingly riveting acute joyride (Howard Hawk's The Thing from Another World)<BR>we've yet seen in the last generation of motion pictures. <br />Name me another picture that can so instantaneously, ambidextrously, and completely shift gears from brutal savagery to out-and-out comedic lunacy (just think of the Christmas Cookies/Blender Sequence) with the stunningly ghoulish extraordinary clout that Gremlins accomplishes without ever batting a reptilian eye.

B0000U0X1G|3.0|Summary:<BR>Jim Street (Colin Farrell) is a young member of the LAPD SWAT team and is partnered with the freewheeling Brian Gamble (Jeremy Renner), whose disregard for authority gets them both kicked off the team.  Jim, however, doesn't want to throw away his career in SWAT, so he humbles himself, a little bit anyway, and does his best to work his way back onto the team.<br />His return is facilitated by the re-hiring of a previous SWAT leader, Sgt. Dan 'Hondo' Harrelson (Samuel L. Jackson), who used to be in charge of the LAPD's SWAT team, but apparently was also controversial.  LAPD Capt. Thomas Fuller (Larry Poindexter) decides that the LAPD needs some positive publicity, so he brings Hondo back to head up a new SWAT team made up of the 'best and brightest'.  Hondo chooses Jim Street, along with Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), David 'Deke' Kay (LL Cool J), Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt), and T.J. McCabe (Josh Charles).<br />Together they are a great team, but they are quickly put to the test when the leader of an international drug cartel, Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez), is caught by the LAPD but tells the news media that he will give whoever breaks him out of jail $100 million.  Of course, every bad guy in L.A. seeps out of the woodwork to try to claim the money.  Hondo's SWAT team is put in charge of protecting the witness and preventing his escape.<br />Eventually, Brian Gamble, Jim's former partner, masterminds a plan to get him out and nearly gets away with it, but for Hondo's team.  The result is a predictable final showdown between Street and Gamble.<br />My Comments:<BR>I went into this movie hoping that it would focus on the elements of action flicks that work (lots of cool stunts, fighting, etc.) and not the ones that don't (romance, subplots, etc.).  Thankfully it keeps the majority of the subplots so far below the primary story that the movie works fairly well.  It still has its problems, but it is much better off for having opted out of trying toincorporate too much.<br />As far as the story goes, you obviously have to suspend belief for the major plot point - a drug cartel leader offering $100 million for someone to break him out of jail.  It would never happen.  But once you get past that part, the story is okay.  The movie does get very slow at times, which isn't a good idea for an action flick.  For instance, there is a lot of footage of Hondo putting together the team.  This is a lot of boring, dead space.  There are also the scenes of the team's training.  Because it is a collage of shots and doesn't really go into their training in any depth, it isn't at all interesting.  It's more like an inexpensive filler between action scenes (which are generally expensive).  <br />Also, the movie glosses over most of the subplots, which is kind of nice.  For instance, Street is dating Boxer's sister when the movie begins, but for some, unexplained reason, their relationship falls apart.  This comes up several times during the movie, but is never really the focus of attention.  There are also backstories for most of the characters (Boxer and T.J. being the exceptions).  And, finally, there is the conflict between Gamble and Street, that drives the climactic showdown, though I should note that the 'climactic showdown' is more of a dark letdown.  It's essentially a 2 minute fist fight between Gamble and Street in near pitch black conditions that ends when Street hits Gamble into a moving train, killing him.  This could have been an okay finale, but because you can't see what is going on, it's not convincing.  You really can't tell who is who, or even if they are the actual actors.  <br />The acting is bearable.  I can't really think of anyone that was absolutely terrible, but neither was anyone great.  I guess you could say the acting is better than in many action flicks, but only about as good as you can expect from an action flick.<br />If you go into this movie with the expectation that you are just going to see a rather mindless action film, you shouldn't be too disappointed.  The only disappointment will come from the slow pace.  The movie could really be cut down 20 to 30 minutes without making much of a difference for the plot.  I'd recommend this movie for action film fans, just don't expect more than the action and be ready for the slow parts.
B00000JAXT|1.0|Robert Wyatt has his moments, and this band was capable of some great work, but this CD is best used as a coaster for your beer can.  After one listein I hurried down to the used CD store to help them rotate their stock with it.  Caveat emptor!
B00005JM02|4.0|While I am growing sick of computer-generated special effects in most live action movies, Pixar's brand of moviemaking continues to astonish and impress. &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is another wonderful Pixar film because it has a great story. Period. The screenplay is terrific. It has detailed characters, very funny dialogue, and action sequences that flesh out and advance the story. There is a wealth of material here and dozens of characters both major and minor, but the movie never bogs down. It is fast, nimble and has a refreshingly light touch that has become the trademark of Pixar. If only the other studios would pick up on the Pixar maxim: that good stories and good characters make for good movies.<br />And what a beautiful world has been created here. George Lucas went to insane extremes to render fantastic new interstellar worlds for the latest round of &quot;Star Wars&quot; episodes, but &quot;Nemo&quot; far outshines even that level of visual excellence. The film just plain felt alive on the big screen -- deep, rich colors of a variety that closely approximates reality -- and it's just as gorgeous on DVD.<br />The vocal performances are ingenious and touching. Albert Brooks got into movies to play Marlin the clownfish, and though some of Ellen DeGeneres' mugging grows a bit irritating (a little of her &quot;whale talk&quot; goes a long way), her Dory is a loveable character.<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; far surpassed even &quot;The Lion King&quot; at the box office, but it's a toss-up as to which is the &quot;better&quot; film. I think &quot;Lion King&quot; has a more deeply affecting story, and on a certain philosophical level is more adult. I would rank &quot;Nemo&quot; among the top five animated family films of all time (the &quot;Toy Stories&quot; are also both way up there). It's a classic.
B000067FP7|4.0|Footnote: Official Actual Review: **** 1/4 stars (four and a quarter star rating)<br />In the summer of 1984 as Ivan Reitman's ceaselessly beloved supernatural box-office comedic powerhouse Ghostbusters was prevailingly netting all the profuse blockbuster revenues and inestimably enshrining itself adamantly with adoring audiences across all divides as the year's principally paramount money rainmaker of the year, a minor monster film B-Movie tribute to Capracorn and 1950's space paranoia exploitation flicks came into circulation at around the same time. Internationally released to movie theaters around the globe, Gremlins was an unappeasably premeditative liberating commandeering of the world's silver screens in one fell swoop of cinematic amnesty from the norm. Unhesitatingly conspiring and invigoratingly procuring to unhesitatingly unleash a mischievous torrent of cantankerously inconsolable scaly adversarial hellions wantonly assailing restrained movie tastes with the provocatively stimulating rousing sensationalism of maliciously volatile foresight. Joe Dante's phenomenally lucrative massively unfashionable bold creative re-imaging of the exploitation genre sensationally ran amok with the general public as it universally grossed resoundingly beyond anyone's comprehension and beguilingly entranced millions more into an atypical personal connection with the film.<BR> <BR>Dexterously consolidating into a whole new age of pop cultural advertising packaging integrating (beginning with Star Wars and exploding with E.T.), Gremlins was principally choked with indefinite unattributable mountains of merchandise. The Gizmo doll, Gremlin action figures, Gremlin lunch boxes, Gremlin posters, Gremlin story-time audio cassettes (do you remember those?) and all sorts of other cherished child and adult paraphernalia that became incredibly dispensed at an glaringly astronomical pace. Yet at the heart of this significant immeasurable love affair with the Gremlins and it's essentialmyth, lies ultimately the film itself. After nearly twenty years and untold droves of imbecilic rehashes, moronic re-shoots, and Kindergarten retreads, the film remains an indisputable pop culture cinematic touchstone classic of the 1980's. Directed by cinematic maverick satirist Joe Dante (Gremlins 2: The New Batch, The Howling, Looney Tunes: Back In Action) and executive produced by the omnipresent commercial dynamo of the 1980's Steven Spielberg, Gremlins is the uncanniest ironclad combination of subversive divine parody (Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life) and thrillingly riveting acute joyride (Howard Hawk's The Thing from Another World) we've yet seen in the last generation of motion pictures. <br />Name me another picture that can so instantaneously, ambidextrously, and completely shift gears from brutal savagery to out-and-out comedic lunacy (just think of the Christmas Cookies/Blender Sequence) with the stunningly ghoulish extraordinary clout that Gremlins accomplishes without ever batting a reptilian eye. You may attribute this attractive charisma entirely to the Gremlins. However it's also Dante's steadfast no compromise craftsmanship that delivers the delicate balance of menace and perversity that remains so universally adored about this film to this very day by so many legions of fans and new viewers alike. <br />Overflowing with the quintessential Looney Tunes spirit of jovial irrelevance pulsating throughout its daffy festivities, the Gremlins bar sequence remains one of the single most mentally arresting moments of Eighties cinema.

B00003CXBK|4.0|Princess Mononoke is a very well animated movie that is complete in itself. It has a theme of peace rather than violence, and a respect for nature, though I would definitely say it's gory enough (and so deserves the pg-13 rating). On the whole, I'd say it's a superior work in anime, and the plot is easier to follow than most. Good for those fairly new to anime as well.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Yes, her voice may not sound like it used to, but that's okay! Her amazing talent still shines through, and her incredible voice never fails to move me to tears.  This album offers a variety of songs, so crank it up and enjoy this upbeat, uplifting holiday album ~ it definitely grows on you!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Good! This album is better than previous album.<BR>but, her voice heard a little dry. <BR>I think that her condition wasn't good.<BR>I feel confident that next album better than this album.<BR>Therefore, i'm looking forward to next album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is definitely, by far, Britney Spears' best album to date. It is a transition (yet not total seperation) from her former teenybopper pop days. There are still pop influences incorporated through this album, but with heavier and darker beats, and even dance and techno influences on different songs. All of the songs are really really good, with some exceptions of course. The CD starts out with the danceable \\"Me Against The Music\\" featuring Britney's new best friend, Madonna. The album then plunges a bit with the rap-laced \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\", but rebounds with the awesome beats of \\"Showdown\\". The next song, \\"Breathe On Me\\", sounds like something straight off of either Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\" CD, or Kylie Minogue's \\"Fever\\" CD. \\"Early Mornin'\\", the next song on the album, was produced by, surprisingly, Moby. It's pretty good. Next, comes, in my opinion, the best song on the album: \\"Toxic\\". \\"Toxic\\" is very very very good, with a fun chorus, and an awesome beat. The next song, R. Kelly's \\"Outrageous\\", is a bit repetitive and gets old fairly quickly. Following, is the ultra-sexy \\"Touch Of My Hand\\", in which Britney talks about a certain hush-hush topic. It's surprisingly good, and deserves all the hype it is already getting. The next song, \\"The Hookup\\" is one of my least favourite songs on the CD. It sounds like a wannabe \\"Baby Boy\\" (Beyonc&eacute;) but doesn't even come close to being as good as \\"Baby Boy\\". The album slows down a bit with \\"Shadow\\", one of Britney's best ballads. Then comes \\"Brave New Girl\\", the song closest to being from the Britney of the past, with a pop-ish sound, and a computerized Britney-ish voice singing along with her (yes I like the song). And, for a singer not especially noted for her singing ability or ballads, or personal songs for that matter, Britney shines her way through \\"Everytime\\", one of the best songs on the CD. Finally, the fun concludes with a \\"Me Against The Music\\" remix, which isn't that bad. It's not great, but it's not bad. So, you see, this album is one of the best CD's of the year, and, in my opinion, Britney's best CD to date. I highly recommend this, and I give it two thumbs way up! ENJOY!!!!!!!!o, you see, this album is one of the best CD's of the year, and, in my opinion, Britney's best CD to date. I highly recommend this, and I give it two thumbs way up! ENJOY!!!!!!!!
630027120X|4.0|The Mission directed by Roland Joffé, starring Robert De Niro, Aidan Quinn and Jeremy Irons is an intense movie about a tribe of Guarani Indians living in the rainforests of South America.  Mendoza (De Niro),  a man who joins the mission of Father Gabriel's (Jeremy Irons) to obtain forgiveness for murdering his own brother.  Father Gabriel is a devout Jesuit who along with a few other Jesuit missionaries, introduce Christian beliefs to this group of Indians.  These men help the Guarani establish a basis for religion, education, and help them to build their lives around the Church.  This movie portrays the unfair treatment of these Guarani Indians and the men who fought with all they had to save them. <br />I really thought that this movie did a good job of portraying what these men went through to accomplish all that they did and everything that they gave up for the Guarani.  The ending of this movie is the most intense part of the whole movie and something that I can't seem to forget.  Even after everything that happens, you can still see the hope that is left in for the Guarani Indians and without that hope shown, I don't think I would of like the movie as much.

B0000DD7LB|3.0|This new Britney Spears cd is ok.It is not her best work.The only good songs on the cd are:&quot;Me Against The Music&quot;,&quot;Breathe On Me&quot;,&quot;Toxic&quot;,&quot;Shadow&quot;,and &quot;Everytime&quot;.All the other songs are just ways to fill the album.She should have put better songs on the album.If you are a true Britney Spears fan,then buy the album.
B000002C1Z|5.0|I think that this has to be Pink Floyd best album. I have listened to this album numerous times and I cant get anough of it. The Sound is unbelievable, and the guitar work in &quot;Dogs&quot; is great. There are 5 good songs on this Album, Pigs on the Wing, Pt 1, Dogs, Pigs (Three Different Ones), Sheep, and Pigs On The wings, Pt 2. This is a must buy for any Pink Floyd Fan.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|So I'm not going to lie, listening to this CD isn't going to help you find the meaning of life or give you a spiritual awakening.  But if you take the music for what it is, fun music to dance and hang out too, then it's a pretty good buy.  Almost all of the songs are upbeat, and her two ballads on the album are good as well.  So if you want a fun CD I'd reccommend this one.
B000092Q4U|5.0|incredible, every song on here is amazing, 11th hour being the best. great drum work and insane guitars...flowing bass...and to top it off, one hell of a vocalist. while getting somewhat recognition while being on headbangers ball, they only put bands such as korn and static x...even hatebreed to shame...sells at a very cheap $9.99 as well...so there is no excuse not to own this
B0000CFW87|5.0|I just bought this album yesterday (not from Amazon but from B.J's Wholesale-here it's cheaper without the s and h) and I just have to say that this is the absolute best that Joshua Winslow Groban has EVER sounded.  Chances are that Josh will never read this review, but, I must say anyway that this is the epitomy of gorgeous voices.  This is his absolute best-so far.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album has layers and layers of hidden meaning. When I first bought the album, I thought it was mediocre. That was until I read the lyrics. It all made more sense. It's pretty rare that you can actually understand him through his whining in any of his songs, but when you read the lyrics, you hear so much more.
B00009V7T2|4.0|Ok first of all i love this album.I love the whole mood and feel to it.However from all the reviews i heard about it i thought it was going to be GODLY i mean i expected it to be greater than anything ive heard, well boys and girls it really isnt.Dont get me wrong this album is great but i really dont see how people can think its the greatest thing since sliced bread.Take it from me that this album is infact a great album but its not a masterpiece.I would give this a 4.5 if i could but its not worth a PERFECT rating.<br />Best song: &quot;Roulette Dares&quot; is my favirote on this album but the gigantic &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot; clocking in at over 12 minutes long is a heck of a song also.<br />Bottom Line:Like i said before this is a great album (it is also at a very good price) however dont get your hopes to high for this one or u might be a little disapointed like me.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack for an equally entertaining movie. The soundtrack has hits from all different genres of music. <BR>It compliments the movie so well that when you listen to it you can easily recall the scene that it was playing in the film.<BR>My favourite songs were:<BR>Kelly Clarkson's song: It lets her display her vocal range and furthers supports her title as an American Idol.<BR>Maroon 5's song: It is a catchy tune that you could just sit back and listen to. <BR>Norah Jones: Her song brings the mood down to a more intimate atmosphere.<BR>This cd is definitely worth getting for your collection if you are looking for a cd that has a variety of great songs.
B00005JMF6|5.0|This film was all that I expected and more. It is an Intense thriller- drama-horror film. It will leave you wondering the whole time what will happen next.It has a very twisted ending, and wild story line. This is definatly on my list of must see movies. In fact, I think that I would say that this may be one of the scariest of 2003. GO SEE IT.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania really knows how to make her audience enjoy her music. She moves the fans like she has never before in this awesome DVD. I love every song and every outfit. I am very glad that she released this DVD. It will make an excellent Xmas present!
0553274503|4.0|I finally got around to reading this book after hearing about it(and seeing some of the movie). Overall,it's a great story. The author convincingly shows how Charlie goes from being mentally disabled to brillant within a few short months of being operated for an experiment about increasing IQ's that first was tried out on a mouse. People are a bit more complicated than lab mice,however,and therein lies the story. Charlie experiences a whole range of emotions and thoughts that make his life much more complex and confusing and at times makes you wish that he was never used as a &quot;guinea pig&quot;. In the end, however,you end up rooting for him and hope he stays where he is mentally. How he gets money for an apartment,etc is glossed over but that's a minor flaw in an otherwise,fascinating,involving story.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The show opens with a stunning performance of Man! I Feel Like A Woman! Throughout the show Shania moves around the stage perfectly interacting with her band and working the crowd. If you attended the Chicago show you may just see yourself on the dvd. The show contains a mix of 22 songs classic and new material. What an evening!
B00005JMFO|3.0|Writer-director Richard Curtis intends his Christmas-themed, indulgently operatic \\"Love Actually\\" to be an Altmanesque tour of comic romance dashed with London wit. It is and it isn't: While a handful of the dozen or so couplings produce funny, poignant scenes, others border on insult, and never does the ensemble piece come together in its entirety. British humor is more literate, but, in many cases, no less shameless. <br />The movie is so protracted and bracketed into segments you can divide it into categories: <br />Terribly good: Hugh Grant, as usual, as the British Prime Minister sweet on his buxom, foul-mouthed catering manager (Martine McCutcheon). While their attraction is quite like a president/intern tryst with which we're all so familiar, Grant is such a daft fool we don't mind. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman accurately portray a married couple rocked by infidelity. Though others may groan at it, I liked a bit story about a good guy who loves his best friend's new wife (Keira Knightley). Ditto for the aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who recaptures the pop charts with an ugly \\"Christmas\\" remake of an old tune. <br />A Bit Sordid: The story of a luckless-in-love American woman (Laura Linney) saddled with a mentally ill brother - who, uh, also happens to be in London - is better suited to its own story. Liam Neeson is good as a widow whose young stepson has fallen in love, but Curtis takes the sugar too far. <br />Bloody awful: A ludicrous cross-cultural romance between a crime writer (Colin Firth) and his Portugeuse maid, and an awkward, stupid meet cute of body doubles on a film set. Both, however, are trumped by British geek's quest to bed sex crazed American women. <br />\\"Love Actually\\" is loaded with odd quirks. Black actors are cast throughout the movie as sidekicks in an obsequious, almost proplike manner, and Curtis digs on fat people with no particular point in mind. A subplot involving Grant's PM and a creepy American president (Billy Bob Thornton, entirely unconvincing) is heavyhanded. And one of the body doubles is a disturbing lookalike of Mia Farrow in \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\" <br />Curtis, who wrote \\"Notting Hill\\" and \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", is talented, but his arrogance peeks through, and his directing doesn't play away from it. In certain moments, the movie projects something resmebling disgust. <br />And yet the other moments, the good zingers, are worth a single viewing. Grant caroling. Thompson, putting together her husband's imperfections to a Joni Mitchell song. Rowan Atkinson in a snappy little cameo as a fastidious department store clerk. A scene where Knightley's character \\"gets it.\\" Now that Curtis has the bravado out of his system, his sophomore directing effort should be more focused on those kinds of moments, and less fixated on delivering the world a giant love letter.
0694013889|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter, and now have it on my wish list for my grandson (the boys version) We already used the girls version for my grand daughter!<br />Not only does it facilitate communication between parent and child concerning potty training, it's also a great way to introduce kids to non-fiction books, and books that are otherwise relavent to life skills, allows parents to potty train with some humor, but breaks the ice of embarassment for those who have a bit of reservation about how to potty train.<br />Not only does this book almost potty train for you, it also sparks interest in other books, and in reading. The copies of the boys' and girls' versions (I had both) were read until they were falling apart (and it wasn't because they weren't made well - we literally wore these books out reading them over and over and over again!)<br />This book, and paying attention to the signs of when my daughter and grandaughter needed to go, along with a potty chair, is all we needed to get her off to potty-training success! She graduated in record time! (She was out of diapers I think by about 18 months!)<br />This book is a MUST HAVE for any parent potty traning a child (Well, a girl anyhow - there is also a boy's version which I used with my daughter that is just as awesome!)<br />If I could give this book 100 stars I would! I think it ought to be given to parents in those hospital packs that hospitals send home, or given out at pediatricians' offices when kids are due for immunizations around a year old.<br />Daily reading to my kids is something that I started before they were even born, and is SO important to their speech development, and to their language development. Having a book toddlers can relate to in real life helps them understand reading is more than just about 'stories' - it can relate to real life experiences as well!<br />My kids are grown, and I am extatic to see these books (the boys and girls versions) are still available for my grandkids!<br />Blessings to the author, Alona Frankel Thank you!!!br />Blessings to the author, Alona Frankel Thank you!!!
1558908382|5.0|Grosse Pointe Blank is a quaint little movie about a professional assassin (John Cusack) and the woman (Minnie Driver) who loves him. Martin Blank (Cusack) is tired of his job as a hit man. He's finding that life as a semi-sociopathic killer-for-hire just ain't what it used to be. His terrified therapist (Alan Arkin) is no help at all. Mr. Blank's salvation arrives in the form of an invitation to his 10 year highschool reunion. At first he doesn't want to go, even though he's got a hit to perform in the same locale. After all, what would he have to say to all those former classmates? Plus, he'd have to face the girl he stood up on prom night (Driver)! GPB is not your typical love story. I was wide-eyed during the explosion, gun battles, and karate sequence, while at the same time admiring the cuteness of the Cusack / Driver coupling! I kept saying, &quot;Aw, they really need each other!&quot; throughout the death and destruction. I have never seen a movie that is able to balance the action, romance, and (jet black) comedic elements the way this one does. Check out Dan Aykroyd as the rival hit man, obsessed with either getting Blank to join his new hit man's union (&quot;it's more like a club&quot;) or killing him. Joan Cusack is brilliant (as usual) as Blank's contact person / &quot;secretary&quot;. Easily my favorite romantic / action / black comedy / John Cusack movie! Buy it right now...

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Give it up for Britney.  She is &quot;Not A Girl&quot; anymore.  Her new CD, &quot;In The Zone&quot; offers up a more mature sound and an intimacy sure to shock some and intrigue others.  Britney has entered the &quot;Zone&quot; and inched right up alongside pop icons Madonna and Janet Jackson as a premier performer.  Britney may not have the best voice in the biz, and certainly doesn't claim to, but she has rarely sounded better than she does on cuts like &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot; and &quot;Toxic.&quot;  She practically invokes Madonna's spirit on &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; and tells us how a woman can be &quot;self-sufficient&quot; on &quot;Touch of My Hand.&quot; (You'll have to listen to the words to know what I mean.)<br />Anyone who is a true blue synth-pop fan should own this disc.  I defy you to listen to this CD and not respond to Britney's command to &quot;let me see you dance.&quot;
B00005JLD4|5.0|My husband and I really loved the story and its potrayal.<BR>Very moving, not a single boring scene or monent and a story that ensures that human spirit is undieable.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|This combo is well worth the money for any fan.  I was unable to see a show this year and this dvd has gotta be the next best thing.  True, it's disappointing that the live versions of these songs are mostly identical to the studio ones but it's still a lot of fun to watch.  Martin's voice holds up surprisingly well and the guitar work is also emphasized nicely.  The set list is sweet and 'One I Love' and 'Moses' are new classics.  I recommend it.
B00000IQW5|5.0|I just re-watched Always - again.  The cast is marvelous.  The movie and script are memorable and touching.  &quot;It's not the dress, it's how you see me.&quot; or Dorinda shopping in her sleep or Audrey Hepburn playing an Angel.  This movie is one of my favorites and I rewatch it again and again and again.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney belongs in Vegas as a show girl!  She can strut her stuff, but she can't sing.  If you watch the videos I'm sure many are taken with her. But if you listen to the CD with no Britney in site it's terrible!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I agree with many of the people giving good comments about this movie. The movie feels a bit shallow but it is very entertaining. Yes, we've seen the action before but believe me the movie feels different, i guess because of the werewolf-vampire story. <br />Go see it. By the way, Kate Beckinsale was charming and played beautifully (better than the Matrix's Trinity. And I've no doubt that Kate is a very talented actress).
B000002J23|4.0|This an excellent cd musically while at times it gets a little mechanical vocally in Machine massiah nad Into the Lens. My favorite tracks are Run into the light, Does it really happen, and Tempus fugit. It sure beats Tormato but not quite Close to the Edge.
076790592X|4.0|Seriously! We all have to die someday and can learn something from this book Tuesdays with Morrie. OMG I had so many emotions in this book. It is a true story and a good one. It teaches and teaches and teaches some more. We all need a lesson where we are not biased and are not head strong like when we are argumentative or shallow and this book makes us all sit down and think about our lives and how we should do the best to enjoy it and laugh and be funny while being real to our core. A book for all of the human race.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|30 great b-sides, rarities, and unreleased tracks to please any Pearl Jam fan.  I was thrilled to hear the early b-sides (Alone, Footsteps, Dirty Frank) plus the import release of TEN closing track Wash to remember the band in its heyday, and equally enjoyed Riot Act's extra track Down - excellent.  These coulda-been hits are interspersed with other cuts that either never made the studio albums or were on benefit albums (Whale Song) for a truly enjoyable selection.  No, not every song is a classic (though Last Kiss is included, which was perhaps one of their biggest radio hits, as well as Yellow Ledbetter, which enjoyed some radio play in 1993 and is now a concert-closing staple).  But even the eclectic songs (Black, Red, Yellow - complete with Dennis Rodman's voice, and Sweet Lew) are interesting to listen to.  I marveled at the instrumental genius of Brother and the quiet intensity of Dead Man Walking.  Anyone who has followed Pearl Jam this far would enjoy this collection.  For a compilation of &quot;extras&quot;, the material here is stronger than many bands' actual releases.  Plus, LOST DOGS includes interesting liner notes with todbits about each song from different members of the band.  What a treat!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Told like some mythic western fairy tale, Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West may be his best film. It's outrageous and darker than any John Ford western. Leone's trademark sweeping camera moves and larger than life moments are all here. What makes West so memorable is the way it plays with the western genre, the myths perpetrated by cinema and the more self consciously arty European cinema (in contrast to the narrative pulp driven American cinema). It's also as simple as this; Leone fills the screen with images as epic as one can imagine.<br /><br />The plot itself isn't as important as the way its told. In the hands of a more conventional director, West could have still been a very good western but it would have lacked the central element of all Leone's films--the element of satire that brims beneath the surface of his films. There was also a sense of irony at work in all Leone's westerns that helped to breathe new life into a moribound film genre.<br /><br />Harmonica (Charles Bronson)is on the trail of Frank a ruthless sociopath and killer. We're never clued into why but Frank, despite his brutal nature, is clearly afraid of Harmonica; he sends three of his best men (two of them are played by Ford regulars Jack Elam and Woody Strode in a brilliant nearly wordless opening sequence) to meet him at the train station and kill him. Harmonica's nickname proves to be accurate;  he plays a series of long, mournful notes almost like a funeral march as a prelude to killing all three.<br /><br />Shortly after meeting Harmonica, we see just how ruthless and deadly Frank can be. He quietly attacks the McBain family who is preparing a feast to welcome their father Brett's new bride. In a brilliantly shot sequence (almost as stunning as the opening sequence), Frank and the members of his gang gun down the family.  We see Frank for the first time and we're stunned as we recognize the blue eyes of Henry Fonda.<br /><br />The dialog is minimal considering the epic length of this film. Also featured in a stunning cast is Jason Robards, Claudia Carindale, Lionel Stander and Keenan Wynn. The film's tone varies from absurd to quietly spooky as we watch Harmonica attempt to corner Frank. His motivation isn't made clear until near the end of the film and, surprisingly, the sequence works.<br /><br />The DVD transfer is vivid and sharp. The film has some minor blemishes in the form of edge enhancement but even these aren't a major issue. The film's rich color and cinematography are finally rendered in an aspect ratio similar to the original theatrical version. None of Leone's widescreen images are cropped and we see Monument Valley in all its glory (which is important as the valley itself is an important character).<br /><br />The Blu-ray comes with a number of extras. Unfortunately, Leone died in the 80's before the advent of DVD's and Blu-ray so there's no audio commentary from him. Instead, we get a cobmined commentary track from other film directors (including John Carpenter and John Milius)that helps bring added depth to the film. There's also commentary from film historians Christopher Frayling and Sheldon Hall.<br /><br />Three documentaries are included and feature interviews with Claudia Cardinale, Gabriele Ferzetti, Bernardo Bertolucci (who helped come up with the story) and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli. Of the three I found An Opera of Violence to be the most enlightening but all three are very good. The featurette Railroad: Revolutionizing The West brings added background as the coming of the railroad is instrumental to the plot of the film.<br /><br />The soundtrack is almost as good as the visuals. The film is presented with a lossless English 5.1 Surround and with a restored English mono track.<br /><br />We also get both the extended version and theatrical version of the film.<br /><br />Paramount has done a spledid job of presenting the film with a terrific looking high def transfer. When the film first appeared andthe box office wasn't all that great, Paramount pulled it from circulation, recut it removing about 30 or so minutes of the film. The recut film was re-released and did just as badly before at the box office.<br /><br />Overall, West was one of Leone's most important pictures and has finally been returned to that position with the restoration of the cut footage. The extras and care with which the transfer was handled make this an essential addition to any collection.n, recut it removing about 30 or so minutes of the film.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|This is a beautiful album.  Whitney sounds better than ever, her voice has come back.  I love the song with her and her daughter.
B000000OSG|4.0|The second Illusion is a good sequel to first- they tend to tie together at some parts and contradict each other at the same time.  Anyway, Use your Illusion I and II are two great albums that fit well together.  This one is a little more mellow and heartbroken, where is the first was fast and furious.  Some highlights of this album include \\"Civil War\\", \\"14 Years\\", \\"Estranged\\", and \\"Knocking on Heavens Door\\" (a Bob Dylan cover, but still great in the hands of Guns n Roses.)  I also liked the revised \\"Don't Cry\\", which featured the same instrumental recording as the original, but altered lyrics.  \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is also a good rocker, while the live \\"Get in the Ring\\" provides this albums with a little bit Guns n Roses' typical anger.  As i listened to this album, i noticed a few mediocre points, and a few over used riffs, but all in all i really liked it- until it hit track 14.  \\"My World\\" is the worst song I have ever heard.  Its a minute of Axl at his self- centered worst, going on about sex and the sort.  What's more- it's rap!!!  It sounds like a bad Insane Clown Posse song.  What a lousy way to end a really good album!  That is the only reason why this album gets four (and not five) stars.  I hate this song so bad, i took the cd and scratched up the outermost rings so that when it came to this song it wouldn't play.  And I'm sorry to say, this was a hint of what guns n roses' next move would be.  Good music ends here for Guns n Roses. <BR>Bottom Line:  Buy this album, Use Your Illusion I, and Appetite for Destruction and end your Guns N Roses collection there.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|At first listen, I wasn't sure how I felt about the CD. There was no &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot;. Three weeks later and the disc has not left my player. What does that tell you. No &quot;Sweet&quot; needed. Sarah has a way with words that just hit inside and at the same time can comfort you. She truly has the voice of an angel and this disc is simply gorgeous. &quot;Fallen&quot; is a wonderful opener. My favorite tracks are &quot;World On Fire&quot;, &quot;Stupid&quot;, &quot;Drifting&quot;, &quot;Train Wreck&quot;, and &quot;Answer&quot;. That is not to say that there are ANY bad tracks. If you are new to Sarah then start with &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; and you will soon end up here. A quiet anger and pain is sometimes heard ten times more than a loud angry one (cough cough Avril).
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this is an awesome cd!  I highly reccomend purchasing it.  It is BY FAR her best cd yet.  I haven't taken it out of my player since i bought it.  It has a really neat club/rave sound...and all of the songs are very diverse which is a big plus.  Some songs are a little racy, but it is safe to say that britney is grown up enough and has enough support to feel free to do musically what she loves and feels is best. AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Buy the cd, even if you have a cd burner....SUPPORT BRITNEY
055357342X|5.0|third part of the ice and fire series. absolutely riveting.<br />two main complaints on this book by other reviewers :<br />1. is this series going to be endless like the wheel of time? - the amazon review for the first part of this series says that this series is supposed to be a six part series. and this is only the third book. if it goes beyond six books, then we can start levelling accusations against GRRM having succumbed to the lure of money!<br />2. too much bad news for the good guys - with both robb and cate stark dying it is indeed shocking and also quite depressing. but also to note is that within the next 50 pages, monster boy king jeoffrey is also dead. another 50 pages, the giant cleagane is mortally wounded. jaime lannister suddenly turns a new leaf and starts developing scruples. so yes there's misfortune for the heroes - but likewise for the villains too and so there's some balance.<br />apart from all this though the book is highly engaging, still i feel that the story is weak in plot. by totally dispersing the stark family all over the seven kingdoms the underlying theme seems to be at getting them all back together - individually each stark have their own adventures which forms the sub-plots. but something or the other always prevents this reunion happening (sansa is kidnapped by littlefinger or arya by the hound etc) and thus the story is sustained. a true story teller would have been much more innovative. so imo GRRM is not in the league of JRRT.

B0000B1OFL|5.0|This was a well rounded film with everything that makes movies impact you and draw you in. The acting was fantastic and the story was a sit on the edge of you're seat thriller. I have to say that this movie keeps you thinking and trying to figure out the next move, when you think you got it, it hits you with a twist again. I wish more movies met this standard of craftmanship and pure talent. This is a must see if you enjoy suspense and James Bond type action. Go for the gold.
B000025RAU|5.0|Bad boy Roman Polanski filmed this gorgeous movie with Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway set in Los Angeles during the 30s - it's about water rights for southern California, which is all about money, money, money. One gets the feeling while watching this film that it's patterned on maybe a Raymond Chandler/Sam Spade book. It's all about incest, infidelity, politics, treachery, lying, secrets - and no one who has seen it is likely to forget the scene in which Polanski himself appears for a brief and memorable sleazy cameo performance as a slimy scumball in cinema's best tradition.<BR>Watch it again. It heralded a new wave of really well done crime films from Hollywood.
1878424165|5.0|I completely enjoyed this program. Deepak Chopra did a fantastic job instructing on the concepts and laws of drawing abundance to you. The program was able to hold my intrest and provoke a great deal of thought. This was the start of my exploration of the spiritual nature that we all have. I purchased it because I wanted to learn tricks to have better luck and make more money, what I got was far beyond what I ever expected in terms of enlightenment. I did find more abundance and I also found a new thankfulness for the fantastic things I have in my life. You may say that it helped me draw more of the good stuff into my life but also allowed me to see my wealth that I had never seen before. I am grateful for having gotten this information and hope you find the joy and wealth in you're life as a benifit from this program. Small investment with a big return.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I'm having a hard time deciding just why I'm having such a mixed and somewhat negative reaction to this new disc.  We've been waiting for this for so long, I guess I was expecting something different.<br />First off, I didn't think they would change the order of the tracks, let alone take off a couple of songs and add one in their place.  I've listened to this, my favorite Beatles album, so many times, I have an imprint in my mind of what song is next.  So hearing them out of order is unsettling.  But that's no big problem since I can program my CD player.  But that doesn't fix the fact that two songs are gone.  And I like the chatter and background that reminds us that some of these were live recordings.<br />So, what did I expect?  I thought the strings were going to be pulled off, like on The Long And Winding Road and All Across The Universe.  OK, we got that, and thanks.  Much better.  The horns are gone off of Let It Be.  Great.  But I liked the homey sound of the chatter at the beginning of Two Of Us, For You Blue and Get Back, and the false start on Dig A Pony.  And I see no reason for pulling Dig It and Maggie Mae off.  I do appreciate that they added Don't Let Me Down.<br />How about sound quality?  This isn't as easy to hear as I expected - and I carried the discs around to three systems that would be considered relatively high end in anyone's mind.  Surely, modern mastering and mixing technology in itself is way better today than when the original two-track master was produced?  Well, the new remastering does have slightly smoother highs and slightly lower noise, but the improvement is not as dramatic as I'd expected.  It's easy to hear differences in the mix, such as the guitars and bass on Get Back, but the thing that impressed me most is that the original mastering job was well done for it's era.  On the songs where strings and horns are pulled off, the improvement is more easily noticed.  The stripped songs sound stark in comparison, and in a good way.  The piano, guitar and voice cuts through and the songs sound more honest.  The effect is fairly dramatic.<br />So, should you buy it?  If you don't have the original, I'd recommend buying either disc.  If you have the original, here's what I recommend: (assuming you're a hard core Beatles fan) buy the new one and take both discs to your computer.  Make your own compilation, using the original tracks if, like me, you like the chatter.  Compile in the tracks from the new disc where strings and horns are stripped off, and tracks with no chatter.  Stick Maggie Mae and Dig It back on, where they belong.  Put Don't Let Me Down on the end and used the original sequence for the rest.  Burn it.  There - you now have the best of both worlds!ay.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am a 30 year old woman and I think that this is by far her best cd yet. It has some of the best beats and the finest grooves around!<br />Some of the best songs are &quot;Breathe on Me&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, and &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;, which contrary to what some say is not the song of a 22 yr. old nymphomaniac! These songs are well done and she deserves some props!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Fellow academics, young Ms. Spears continues to explore the depths of humankind, on this her fourth compact disc masterpiece.  Spears' ever-growing maturity shines through yet again, as themes of mortality, religion, the cycle of life, and self-doubt permeate this complex musical offering.  Forgoing the usual pop fluff her contemporaries so readily latch on to, Spears breaks barriers and literally reinvents the wheel of serious-minded music on such songs as &quot;Toxic&quot; and the already-classic &quot;Me Against the Music,&quot; done so professionally with woman icon of our age - Madonna.  <br />Brilliantly see-sawing from masterful piano work on her subdued, sorrowful ballads to playing her self-written acoustic gems, the ever-young Britney has upped the qualifications and standards to which all music must be measured.  Forever shunning the spotlight, Britney Spears' latest compact disc is for the lovers of the underground music world, the silent and unspoken for relics of society who beg to be heard through her vision.  <br />Aptly titled, painstakingly organic, always her own person, &quot;In the Zone&quot; is perhaps Spears' best compact disc since her last effort.  If you haven't heard this poetic, workmanlike slice of genius by Britney, what in Christ's good name are you waiting for?  <br />Transcendent, folks.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I got this CD a little before it came out, and, at first listen, I hated it.  The first time I heard &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; I thought it was one of the saddest songs.  And, I still do.  Madonna RUINED the song, not that she had much to ruin.  It's catchy, but not the best song on this CD or any other Britney CD.  The CD in general is a step away from her typical &quot;bubble gum&quot; pop music.  Britney had to evolve since the music industry is stepping away from all that (thank goodness, right?).  I'm a definite Brit fan and this CD is one of her best.  I think her absolute best is her third one, her first one is EXCELLENT, and this one takes third place.  The second one is the weakest to me.  For everyone who says Britney can't sing, listen to her first CD.  Listen to a song like &quot;Born To Make You Happy&quot; or &quot;Email My Heart.&quot;  Then you tell me she can't sing.  Let's not hate her because she's beautiful, talented, and richer than we'll ever hope to be.  I look forward to more of Britney's work and this CD is definitely gonna get a good workout on my CD player.<br />Stand Out Tracks:<br />- Outrageous<BR>- Toxic<BR>- Touch of My Hand<BR>- Shadow<BR>- Everytime (BEAUTIFUL SONG!)<br />Everything else is good, too, but those are the songs I have already come to love.  Bottom line, DON'T judge this CD on &quot;Me Against The Music.&quot;  That is just the catchy radio song they had to put out to get people to buy the album.  Give it a chance.
0812580346|4.0|Classic science fiction. &quot;What if&quot; one thing were different -- how would that change everything else? A very interesting book, well written. It takes place at CERN (the world's main particle physics lab, in Europe) and uses the Large Hadron Collider (which is being built). For me, it's gratifying that Canada's existence, geography, and scientific contributions are acknowledged. The book starts in 2009; and I particularly liked the throwaway line that Stephen Lewis* was now Secretary General of the U.N. <br />In this book, an experiment gives everyone in the world a glimpse of their future. They don't know what it means. If it's a moment of nothing, does that mean they're inevitably going to die before the future moment? Is their future written in stone or merely in clay? Would you dare to fall in love? This book explores the psychological effects of that future glimpse -- and of the devastation caused by everyone on Earth losing consciousness for a minute -- on several main characters. <br />One of the realistic things about Sawyer's writing is that the characters are not superheroes -- they are pretty good people, with weaknesses. So they're not instantly likeable, and we might not identify with their every thought. But they do have thoughts and weight how to do what is right. So-o-o Canadian.<br />(*Mr. Lewis is former leader of the Ontario New Democratic Party and former ambassador from Canada to the U.N. He has recently been involved in investigating the genocide in Rwanda and looking at ways to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa.)<br />[This review was copied from my review on the BookCrossing Web site.]

Lets face it everyone already has a Billy Joel Greatest Hits Collection.

This album is a timeless and grossly underrated Billy Joel classic!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool started in 1992 with an EP entitled \\"Opiate.\\" This was just the beginning of what would be some of the greatest modern music to ever exist. Lateralus what released 5 years after the previous album \\"Aenima.\\" Even with the \\"Salival\\" bootleg in between the two albums, fans were bothered. But it was well worth the wait. Lateralus is the acme of all of Tool's efforts. It's by far the most diverse album. With some songs that would please a fan of Metallica, and others that would delight listeners of Pink Floyd, it is a truly magnificent album. The lyrics can induce a depression or bring about a euphoria, and have multi-layered meanings that soothe teenage angst, and could excite the mind of Plato.<br />But Maynard is not the only person that worked hard on this album. The band's guitarist, Adam Jones, has produced some of his best work yet. And although it would seem that bassist Justin Chancellor topped his efforts with the song \\"Forty-Six & Two,\\" some of the songs such as \\"Ticks & Leeches\\" and \\"The Grudge\\" show his mastery of the instrument. But interestingly enough, the member of the band that gets the least attention may just be the most talented. Danny Carey's drumming is absolutely superb, with influences from all kinds of percussion, from rock drumming to the beats of African natives. The sheer skill of this man is enough to make a band great. And on this album, all of the members of Tool have created what has been an incredible album.

B00009XITP|4.0|&quot;What A Girl Wants&quot; is a delightful, fairy tale romp of a film. If you are a fan of Colin Firth's and don't mind very lite-entertainment, this is a must-see.<br />Once upon a time in Morocco, circa 1970-something, a young British Lord, Henry Dashwood, (Colin Firth), met American beauty, Libby Reynolds, (Kelly Preston), a young rock singer, and the two fell madly in love. A Bedouin tribal chief married them by the light of an African moon. Blessed with thoughts of 'happily ever after' they returned to London, the noble Dashwood family manse, and the real world of the British upper-classes. Dashwood retainers and advisors encouraged Libby, a commoner, to leave her husband for his own good, his future career, etc. After all, she was terribly unsuitable. And so Libby left England, with no explanation and returned to New York City, a walk-up apartment in Chinatown, and a career as a singer.<br />Fast-forward 17 years. Apparently Libby left London with more than her luggage. She is the mother of a lovely and spirited teenager, Daphne, (Amanda Byrnes). Daphne Reynolds has almost everthing a girl could want. She's smart, caring, beautiful and possesses great flair. She has completed high school and has college and a lifetime of possibilities ahead of her. Her relationship with her Mom is open and loving, if somewhat unconventional. But she feels incomplete. Daphne knows all about her father, whom she has never met but has always longed for. Dashwood is totally unaware of his offspring's existance. Daphne always believed that someday her father would discover he had a daughter and come for her. After all these years of no-show Dad, she finally decides to take-off for London and make herself known to him. And the fun begins.<br />Dashwood is engaged to a snobby, aristocratic bore, whose baggage includes a teenage daughter, even more boring than her mother - if that is possible. He has also resigned from the House of Lords and is beginning his political career running for office in the House of Commons. Enter Daphne. Surprise!<br />The interaction and chemistry between Amanda Byrnes and Colin Firth make the film fun. The wicked stepmother and step-sister-to-be are terrific villains. You'll want to hiss and boo everytime they appear on screen. And Eileen Atkins, as Lady Dashwood, Henry's Mum, is wonderful. As her new found granddaughter hugs her, Atkins says, &quot;No hugs, dear. I'm British. We only show affection to dogs and horses.&quot; Oliver James, who plays Ian Wallace, Daphne's love interest, is charming and has a great voice. He's in a British rock band...what else?? The sound track is also quite good.<br />&quot;What A Girl Wants&quot; will never receive an Oscar nomination. If you miss this film it is no big loss, unless you're a Colin Firth fan. This is an unusual role for him and he pulls it off really well. Great eye-candy! I enjoyed it and would recommend it for a few hours of fun entertainment.<br />JANAng for office in the House of Commons. Enter Daphne.

B00005JLEX|5.0|I just read in Entertainment magazine last night that Seinfeld is scheduled to be released on DVD late next year.  That sounds like Christmas time to me?  The execs in the article said that it takes a while to get extra footage and stuff to put on the DVDs and that they have to go back in order to go forward. I sure hope this isn't just a tease.  I can't wait until the DVDs get released!!  This is the BEST show of ALL TIME!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I loved seeing the new and extended scenes on discs 1 &amp; 2-this half of the dvd set worked fine. This version was a total delight for me and it filled in some blanks and questions I had. Very enjoyable and funny in parts-But discs 3 &amp; 4 will not play as some other people have said. Discs 3 &amp; 4 loop between tracks 1 &amp; 2 as the screen stays blank. I tried playing them on two different dvd players to no avail. Nothing would happen even when I pressed stop-I had to eject the disc to stop it from looping. Could not even bring up the disc menu! I am very sad &amp; disappointed about this. I was so exited about seeing the behind the scenes special extras!!!I will be sending it back to Amazon for a refund (The film part was great so do purchase it for that!).
B000089RVR|4.0|I was not a fan of Dido until the Life for Rent CD came out.  At the point where the lyrics to more than one song may as well have been hand written by myself, her songs hit a chord with me.  I think that's the key to her music, relating to it.  The beats behind her cool soothing voice are beautiful.  Granted, there are other CDs with greater impact, but Life for Rent strikes at deep emotions with an honesty not always heard or felt in modern music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The series promised so much and, unlike most other series, delivered far far more than it promised!!!<BR>The balance of a realistically \\"normal\\" group of people, of differing backgrounds, as the crew of Serenity, coupled with the excellent mix high and low technologies that are likely to be found on the outskirts of any technologically advanced society, be it earth bound or in space, lead to a very well balanced \\"realistic\\" portrayal of what frontier life would be like.<BR>The set is recommended to anyone who wants something more gritty and realistic than Star Trek.<BR>Buy it! You really won't be disappointed.<BR>The fact that you're here means that you were probably searching for this series specifically anyway, I know I was!<br />Also pray that someone at Fox wakes up in a cold sweat realising their mistake and the show gets re-instated.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the best show EVER to hit the small screen!<BR>IT is simply that simple.
0790729628|4.0|The prologue begins, \\"Early in the 21st century, the Tyrell Corp. advanced robot evolution into the Nexus phase-a being virtually identical to a human-known as a Replicant. The Nexus 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence to the genetic engineers who created them\\". <br />They are used as slave labor for dangerous work in Off-world colonies. Their design does not include human emotions, however, it seems there's a glitch. After several years a Replicant may develop emotional responses which could lead to resentment of their slave status and rebellious behavior. So a fail-safe is built in; a 4 year life span. When a Nexus 6 combat team stages a bloody mutiny in an Off-world colony, Replicants are declared illegal on Earth - under penalty of death.  Harrison Ford stars as Deckard, a retired Blade Runner, the name given to police assigned to exterminate renegade Replicants.  He's coaxed out of retirement to hunt down an especially crafty and brutal group lead by Roy (Rutger Hauer), that has returned to Earth in search of their creator to demand longer life. During Deckard's investigation, he encounters Rachel (Sean Young), an experimental Replicant that's been given an entire past of artificial memories; parents, a childhood, etc. Rachel doesn't know she's a Replicant and Deckard finds himself emotionally drawn to her, even protective of her. He struggles to make sense of the feelings he has for this \\"thing\\". Clearly at issue are the moral implications of man's pursuit to manipulate the stuff of life, to become a sort of \\"God of biomechanics\\", and how that affects our concept of humanity.<br />Director Scott has created a bizzare and visually stunning landscape that earned Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects and Art Direction.  In this sci-fi noir, the mood is perpetually dark, cold and damp.  Advanced technology contrasts with gothic architecture and urban decay. Ford is great as a burned out Philip Marlow type; Hauer is ultra-cool and menacing with his Aryan features, white hair and black leather. The Director's Cut DVD includes a less upbeat ending than the theatrical release, eliminates Deckard's voice-over and adds a sequence in which Deckard dreams of a unicorn.<br />I greatly admire most of Ridley Scott's work and I own this DVD because it's one of my favorite sci-fi films. However, it's not without it's problems. It was adapted from the classic 1968 sci-fi novel by Philip K. Dick, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\". Perhaps in the heat of the space race it seemed logical that we would explore and colonize other worlds by the early 21st century. But by the time this film was made, the screenwriter should have known that such a scenario was implausible. The unicorn dream is supposed to suggest that Deckard is questioning his own humanity and wondering whether he too may be a Replicant, but how is a viewer unfamiliar with the book supposed to know that? It's an intriguing element that I wish had been communicated and explored. Also, the nature of a Replicant is unclear. It obviously is not a robot in the conventional sense, since genetic engineering is involved. It's \\"a being virtually identical to a human\\", but it's not a genetically altered clone; a clone with a 4 year life span would die as a 4 yr. old child. That we would be creating living \\"robots\\" of flesh and blood in the early 21st century is an even more absurd prediction that space colonization. So, when I watch the film, I pretend the prologue says \\"23rd century\\", then I can just enjoy the director's artistic vision and the thought-provoking story. I eagerly await the new, remastered 5.1 Dolby version reportedly in the works.
B00005JM02|5.0|The beginning part when Marlin's wife Coral and all their eggs (except Nemo) were devoured was sad.  But have you noticed that Disney movies for children seem to always bump off one of the parents?  Try to name more than one (101 Dalmations is one) where they don't kill a parent.  They are for some reason against the family unit as a whole.<br />This movie is great otherwise!  It has us in tears laughing.  The talking whale, &quot;intervention&quot; with the sharks, &quot;You made me ink myself.&quot;   There are tons of lines!  You have to watch it several times to get them.

B0000E1WKE|2.0|Whitney Houston has done it all in her career.  She has sold over 200 million albums worldwide, starred in three highly successful movies, won countless awards and broken so many records that to list them all would be an accomplishment in itself. However, Houston has never released a Christmas album until now, and One Wish, is another chapter in the incomparable legacy of this incredibly talented superstar.<br />However past accomplishments aside, Whitney's voice just isn't what it used to be.  Years of stress, worry and severe drug abuse have taken its toll on her vocal cords, and to hear her struggling to hit notes that were once second nature to her in the past is very sad. The worst part is though is that her voice isn't the only problem here, the album is awful, even laughable at times. Houston re-works &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; (Chesnuts Roasting on an Open Fire) to extend across her wide fan base by including both &quot;Happy Hanakah &amp; Happy Kwanza&quot; into the mix.<br />&quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; gets off to a good start but quickly goes sour, though the guest appearence from her daughter Bobbi Kristina is impressive. &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; is so bad that you will literally be praying for the end to come. Her rendition of &quot;Deck the Halls/Silent Night&quot; is an experiment that doesn't really work in her favor, but the biggest disappointment is her rendition of my favorite christmas song &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;.<br />The album's highlights are few and far between. The album's only new song &quot;One Wish&quot; is a soon to be hit, but is also a perfect example of Houston's lacking vocal ability. &quot;The First Noel&quot; isn't too bad, but it could have been a lot better. The album's brightest moments are &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, and two previously released tracks (from the height of her career in 1996), &quot;Who Would Imagine a King&quot; &amp; the gospel-infused &quot;Joy to the World&quot; which make you yurn for the old Whitney so badly words can't really describe.<br />Overall, this album is an embarrasment to someone who has had such an amazing career. I think its time for Whitney to hang up the gloves and go into an early retirement, because at the moment it looks like a comeback is out of the question. Its such a shame that such an amazing voice has gone to waste, but the damage has been done and the voice that we used to love is gone for good.which make you yurn for the old Whitney so badly words can't really describe.<br />Overall, this album is an embarrasment to someone who has had such an amazing career.

0446530891|3.0|I, too, am a huge Baldacci fan, and I agree with another reviewer that the first half of the book was quite interesting.  The latter part of the book left one with a 'just get me through it' kind of attitude.  I also found a glaring error in context with one of the passages, wrote the editor about it, and got a 'thanks -- we'll look into it' sort of answer.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Since she debuted in 1999, Britney Spears has ruled the pop market from the female perspective, easily outlasting any and all competitors, and rightfully so. She may not have the strongest voice of them all, but face it, the girl can dance, she can sing, she can perform and it doesn't hurt that she is a exhibitionist who just so happens to be one of the sexiest, most controversial women in all of entertainment history. Now with her 4th album, In the Zone, in stores, Britney needs to fully make the transition from teen pop queen, to mature adult diva.<br />While it did take me a while to get used to Britney's new material & new musical approach, I can honestly say that I welcome it, and I give her a great deal of credit for stepping outside the box and taking risks. However, it seems that too many times she is channeling her idol Madonna, especially on \\"Brave New Girl\\". While this is a great track, it just sounds to much like Madonna, whom Britney just made headlines with after their controversial make out session at the VMA's, and who also appears on the album's incredibly infectious lead single \\"Me Against the Music\\".<br />However, Spears still has that style thats all her own, clearly evident on the album's ballads, \\"Shadow\\" & possibly the best song she has ever recorded, the piano tingled \\"Everytime\\". Intresting collaborations make this album worth a listen also, such as production by R. Kelly on the catchy \\"Outrageous\\" & The Ying Yang Twins on \\"(I Got that) Boom Boom\\", the album's soon to be second single. The only time Britney fails to keep my intrest is when she tries to hard to follow trends, such as on the Moby produced \\"Early Mornin\\" & the reggae influenced \\"The Hook Up\\".<br />Other noteable tracks include the hypnotic \\"Breathe on Me\\" & the risque \\"Showdown\\", but the album's most shocking moment would definetly be Spears' ode to masturbation, the extremely sexy \\"Touch of My Hand\\". While Britney croons about having another night without a lover, its very evident that she has left behind her bubble-gum princess image and is fully ready to embrace her womanhood.<br />I'm not going to lie, this album took a lot of getting used to but I'm happy that I gave it the chance, because it once again reaffirms my faith that Britney Spears is a fantastic artist, one who has caught a lot of heat in her short career. Let them have a field day with your personaly life Brit, because they can't really complain to much about the music.dent that she has left behind her bubble-gum princess image and is fully ready to embrace her womanhood.<br />I'm not going to lie, this album took a lot of getting used to but I'm happy that I gave it the chance, because it once again reaffirms my faith that Britney Spears is a fantastic artist, one who has caught a lot of heat in her short career.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|Well I don't feel like writing a long review here, so I'll just say that this is a very good offering from the DT boys. It's all in there and it's all great stuff.

B00005N83M|4.0|Jennifer Lopez - She's simply 'Outstanding' and amazing Singer that I admire. I'd heard her quite few songs earlier 'Waiting for tonight', 'If you had my love'etc but the moment I saw her Channel V 'Stage Show' on a cool Sunday - My God, she's got the inner zeal and I soon got fond of listening to all her songs. Love Don't Cost a Thing has been her hit similar to Waiting for Tonight but three tracks I love most here is 'I'm Real' featuring Ja Rule, Ain't it Funny and Play. All three tracks has great lyrical rythm and has great beats. The spanish number 'Carino' one couldn't understand but has simply the sweet and soft J.Lo touch-more better listening if you ever saw her Stage show singing the song as she pours out her soul singing in her white outfit. I'm gonna be Alright has the beat but not too catchy. J.Lo has the swift moves and poise on the stage and her voice is so confident that she makes an impression long lasting. She's incredibly unbelievable - I wouldn't label her as so sexy but yeah, Jennifer Lopez makes one 'awe-struck' when she dance and sings on Stage. Great Singer & That's Simply 'Outstanding J.Lo.

B0000TB050|5.0|U2 Go Home might just be the best live U2 DVD on the home market today. It's all about U2 being U2. It's raw, it's genuine and it's fun. These factors are what make U2 the band they are today, and were some of the things lacking on their previous DVD release U2 Live From Boston.<br />Sure, the Boston DVD was probably better in technical terms. There were no obvious band slip-ups in that release. However, most of that has to do with inter-cutting moments from the night after while the cameras were still rolling. In U2 Go Home, there is none of that. When the band screws up, you know about it. You see Bono laughing and Larry Mullen smirking after a rocky start to Angel Of Harlem...that's what live music is all about. To be fair the gaffs are rare (unlike what the previous reviewer had to say). However, for those who are paying attention, Bono's voice is much better in U2 Go Home. Overall, the songs are more inspired and powerful this time out.<br />U2 Go Home also did something unique in using a variety of film and video stock for the show. It gave the performance that extra raw feeling. There were no perfectly timed crane shots or any nonsense that you might find in previous U2 live releases. It was also nice to see them use a 16:9 aspect ratio. It really adds to the grandeur of the show and gives the DVD a much more cinematic feel.<br />What about that crowd? I'll take 80'000 screaming hometown fans any day over the 20'000 tame Boston fans. Let's not forget about that silly sit down protest that took place inside the heart that is very visible on TV. (those folks should STILL be ashamed for doing that....you still got a great viewing location that other fans would have done anything for) In U2 Go Home, there is none of that nonsense. It's just a lot of U2 fans who are grateful to be there, even the ones at the back.<br />You're also getting eight songs you didn't get on the Boston DVD. New Years Day, Out of Control, Wake Up Dead Man, Angel Of Harlem, All I Want Is You, Pride, One and Mysterious Ways(bonus track). <br />What's there not to like on this DVD? (well maybe a few more DVD extras would have been cool) This is one of the better U2 performances you'll ever see.
B000001Y5J|4.0|This ep packs quite a large punch despite it's time which barely breaks 30 minutes. This was Nine Inch Nails' sequel to Pretty Hate Machine. <BR>Broken is the polar opposite to PHM. 3 years was definately worth the wait for those who loved the group.<br />Broken is a bluster of anger noise and pain. It differs also in that this time around Trent Reznor points the blame on himself more so than anything (as he would come to do on The Downward Spiral in 94). It may be to some an unbearable listen. Broken is also more guitar-based than drums.<br />Another important thing is that Broken is a somewhat transitional album.<BR>It smoothes the gap between Pretty Hate Machine and Spiral. It contains the catchy songwriting of Pretty, yet has the same notched-up production and distorted guitars that Spiral would have shortly after. <br />On it's own merits, this is a very unique EP and it's one of Reznor's best releases. I consider this album to be NIN's Broken / Spiral period. Not like the Fragile which was very disappointing, especially with a 5 1/2 year wait. <br />I compare this material to Depeche Mode's Songs of Faith and Devotion 1993 or (Oingo) Boingo's Second Self-Titled album in 94.

Its not just a pop album..It has some hip hop, some slow pop and allot of dance.  She is nice and this album is nice.  She sings a ballad to the best of her ability, and it sounds nice.  Now i dont say go and think you are getting Christina's voice because she is not her..  Thats like saying you want Janet to sound like Whitney..Its just not happening.  Cop this cd if you want something to dance to.  Not something to sleep to trust me
B000003TA4|1.0|Pearl Jam is the band that basically told MTV to f- off after their FIRST album - Nirvana is the band that KEPT making music videos until their demise<br />How dare you call Pearl Jam sellouts, Pearl Jam got huge because of their music &amp; they made even less music videos than Nirvana<br />Nirvana is the most over rated, phony fake band EVER - Pearl Jam is truly the greatest band ever, Pearl Jam stuck by their words, Cobain never did<br />FACT: Cobain used to call MTV &amp; tell MTV to play Nirvana's music videos more
B0000DD7LB|5.0|When I listened to this album for the first time, I was speechless, I really had no words to describe it, I still don´t know how she managed to evolve so much from her past works, the album has no fillers, from the great beat of &quot;Me against the music&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot; or &quot;Outrageous&quot;, to the amazing ballads like &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;, passing through the sensuality of &quot;Showdown&quot; and &quot;Early mornin´&quot;, and what can I say about that spark of her previous albums called &quot;Brave new girl&quot;.<br />This is by far Britney´s best album to date and if you ask me, the finest I´ve ever bought, You really have to get it, my favorites are: me against the music, showdown, breathe on me, Early mornin´, shadow, brave new girl and the answer (bonus track).
B000003TA4|1.0|Do you enjoy GOod charlotte, blink 182? do you love MTV? &amp; Avril Lavigne? do you shop at Hot Topic? do you have rich parents? do you WISH you had problems in your life, but dont, because you only want the attention?<br />THEN THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU!!
B00008PW2E|5.0|I'm from Poland, and I fell in love with this series, I'm now waiting for the third season on HBO Poland. My life is like &quot;Six feet under&quot;, they could use me and my family, as the inspiration.<BR>I love everyone who is a fan of this series. I got a friend wich leads life as Brenda in the second series. We both love Ruth.<BR>[...]
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This is the best album the band has done (other than Ten).  Jeff Ament's song &quot;Other Side&quot; is one of the most moving songs I've ever heard!  The rest of the album is awesome too!  A must buy for any Pearl Jam fan... you will not be disappointed!
B00007CVSH|5.0|I've seen some dull, lack-luster Trovs, but this one was truly engaging.  At last we have a Manrico who looks and acts like the gypsy boy he's supposed to be. Cura is unmatched in this interpretation. This looser character is real at last. I blead with him all the way down the maelstorm that was his life.<br />Hovorostovsky, singing like a God, he makes you wonder why Leonora would prefer an unkept  gypsy boy to him.  I'm usually bored with the gypsy Mama, but Naef made me watch every line like I'd never heard it before.  These singers were  totally into the story and they carried me along with them.  <br />Watching this DVD made me wish I'd bought a ticket, flew to London and seen the real thing, live on the stage.
B00006LLNU|4.0|I fell in love with the subwoofer-trembling echoes of &quot;Agaetis byrjun&quot;, but this complilation sounds introverted and contained, somber and complete; a marvel of music. Imagine a thick but tingling organ, Birgisson's near-whistling vocals, piano on one side, and wisps of synth on the other...most bands can only sound this graceful by whispering, or feigning delicacy. Sigur musters the effect with an iron fist, every detail aggressively beautiful. You need good speakers to listen to this music, not to mention a good non-pop appetite. Delectable!
B000000WJ2|1.0|I'm a fan of THE STONES &amp; KEITH but this is just throw away filler.<BR>GAWD it is terrible. Not 1 memorable tune here. Plus his back up band is boring. No life here.
B00005JMFO|5.0|There is very little really not to like about this charming collage of a movie.<br />Brilliant ensemble of actors, and thus by implication great cameos from the ilk of Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Emma Thomson; credible romantic vignettes intercut together, and thankfully not too saccharine to be implausible (not everyone ends up in their preferred romance for instance); a fair bit of nudity (a big bold \\"R Actually\\"); and above all, some delectable humor -- there are sentimentalistic crests but swiftly followed by a jibe or crack that balances the narrative.<br />The vignettes:<br />-- Hugh Grant as a wonderfully self-deprecating bachelor prime minister in love with a benign Brit version of M. Lewinsky<br />-- Liam Neeson as a widower managing his grief by lending his teenager son a hand with his love life<br />-- Colin Firth as a writer with a soft spot for his Portuguese maid while working on a novel in a French town<br />-- Billy Bob Thornton as a nasty U.S. president who gets his comeuppance<br />-- Emma Thomson as the cheery wife of Alan Rickman, an executive who is falling prey to the come-ons of an office colleague<br />-- Bill Nighy as a spent-out rock star on the comeback trail with a holiday version of the Trogg's \\"Love Is All Around\\"<br />-- Laura Linney as an American expat with a romantic life stymied by her obligation to her autistic brother<br />-- Andrew Lincoln as a tortured bloke secretly in love with the trophy wife (Keira Knightley) of his best friend<br />-- Kris Marshall as a wanna-be superstud trying to get to US, \\"cocksure\\" his British accent will be a chick magnet<br />-- Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as two innocents who fall in love while working as stand-ins in a porn movie<br />-- Rowan Atkinson as a prissy department store clerk<br />What more can you ask for in one sitting? Don't read too much into the \\"too long to be interesting\\" reviews, this is a must-watch for anyone with a sensitive bone and an adult pass. It's not your everyday sappy chick-flick but a fascinating tapestry of love and longing in our modern lives.<br />Don't miss it!appy chick-flick but a fascinating tapestry of love and longing in our modern lives.<br />Don't miss it!

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I could go on for pages about just how wonderful the 2001 sensation Moulin Rouge is.  But I won't bother.  As I'm sure you've gleaned from all the other reviewers right now, it's a film that many people love passionately and many others hate just as passionately.  For that reason, you should probably head down to your local rental store before you buy this one.<br />Whether you like it or not, you can't fail to be impressed with how amazingly put together it is.  The look of the film is very distinctive -- it's hardly surprising that it won an Art Design Oscar.  Likewise, the set design and costuming (an Oscar win in Costuming, too) are top-notch, recreating the whimsical, sexy merger of pop culture with 1890s France that creator Baz Luhrman is for.  It's worth looking at even if you don't think you'll like it.<br />But if you do like it, then this DVD is a must-have.  Don't settle for the one-disc edition; I don't care about the cost.  Save up a little longer.  It's worth it.  This is quite possibly the best DVD set ever produced, utilizing the format to its fullest.  Disc 1 features two commentary tracks, both extremely interesting, but the real beauty of the set is in disc 2.  It's there that you'll find the script excerpts, sketches, and discussions that show the film's fascinating evolution.  It's there that you see the music videos that seem obligatory for a film accompanied almost entirely by pop music.  But that's not the real magic of this presentation.  What really makes it special is the uncut dance numbers.  Uncut, multi-angle dance numbers.  Not only do you get to see those energetic, magical sequences from the film come to life -- but you can choose how to see it. ...  It's great.<br />To summarize:  If you're the cautious type, you'll probably want to see it before you buy it.  But if you can find it in your heart to like it at all, then you'll adore this DVD.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania fans are going to enjoy this DVD!  She sings all of her hits and some new songs from the UP album that she performs live in this Chicago concert only.  The pyro technics are awesome.  She is so interactive with her audience that she even invite a few fans to sing/dance on stage with her.  A must have!
B00005JLSE|4.0|&quot;Chicago&quot; is definitely deserving of its nail-biter Best Picture Oscar win.  Following close on the heels of pop musical spectacular &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; &quot;Chicago&quot; is probably the first really successful adaptation of a stage musical to the screen since the 1970s.  It tells the story of adulteress-turned-murderess Roxie Hart and her descent into a life of jazz and fame.  The music is preserved intact from the stage show with just a few deletions and a single addition, and much of the choreography is nearly untouched Fosse.  The set design and costuming are unbelievable, and it's hardly surprising that it took both Art Design and Costuming Oscars.  It's a feast for the eyes and ears.<br />When I first heard that &quot;Chicago&quot; was being adapted for the silver screen, I was quizzical.  When I learned it was to star Renée Zelwigger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere, I had to contain my laughter.  Yet in the theater I was stunned -- they pull it off so perfectly you never even notice.  Catherine Zeta-Jones really shows off her dance background, but Zelwigger does a fine job and when Richard Gere began tap-dancing, it was so smooth that it took a minute to realize how odd the idea was.  Also utterly amazing are Queen Latifah, who belts and struts like nobody's business, and John C. Reilly, who shows the film's greatest emotional depth in his poignant rendition of &quot;Mr. Cellophane.&quot;  They're so perfect for their roles that I find I can't listen to the Broadway cast now; no one else will ever be able to sing those parts for me.  Why they weren't all Oscar winners is hard to understand; why Richard Gere wasn't even a nominee no one will ever guess.  They're perfect.<br />The adaptation for the screen is exquisite.  I've never seen the show, only heard the recording, but their trimming seems to have been neat and the film certainly didn't have a broken-up feel.  Choosing not to stick with the stage play's script was essential unless they wanted to end up with a three-hour long experience like &quot;My Fair Lady,&quot; which probably wouldn't sit too well with modern audiences.  The recasting of all the songs as fantasy numbers acted out in Roxie's head works well, allowing them to toy with the script and also eliminating the slight oddity modern audiences would find in characters strolling down the street and bursting into song.  It's clear that they're still part of the story; it's probably just not happening quite that way in reality.<br />As much as I have raved about this film, why only four stars?  The lackluster DVD loses it its last point.  I mean, color and sound are fine; I have no complaints about the technical aspects of the presentation.  It's just that they made such poor use of the format in the production of this DVD.  A single commentary track and a recording of a number cut from the film late in production are the only bonus features to be found.  We needed lots of interviews and featurettes on the making of the costumes and sets.  We needed footage from rehearsals, to see all the trouble our stars had learning their moves.  Speaking of stars, we needed recordings of other actors and actresses who auditioned for the part, to get some sense of what else the film could have been like.  Most importantly, we needed the uncut, multi-angle dance numbers that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; gave us.  Why none of this is included I can't imagine.  Perhaps they plan to release a supplemental disc or a new two-disc set down the road.  But this incompleteness of presentation loses a star for this otherwise perfect film.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Great plot, great performance, great effects.... excellent movie! Better than the first. This is a must have!!
B0000399WI|5.0|I can't believe this film lost the best picture award to Forrest Gump, one of the most stupid movies made. This film should top all the lists for the best of 1994. Great acting, great photography, great script, great direction: the script particularly is a work of art; not a single word is wasted in telling the story of two men who become friends in prison.<br />I can't really say any more about the plot without spoiling it, so trust me, it's full of twists, and turns and surprises, and is ultimately, extraordinarily fulfilling. Andy (Tim Robbins) is possibly the only wrongly convicted killer in Shawshank Prison. None of the other prisoners believe that he's innocent, of course, and for a long time the viewer doesn't know what to believe either. Andy was a banker, and very smart. He's also very patient, and his patience serves him well in his finest hour. He becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman), a lifer who's already served two decades when Andy arrives at Shawshank. Red can arrange to smuggle anything into the prison-- anything at all. We learn this at the beginning, but don't realize its importance until much later. There's some wonderful foreshadowing that is so subtle, most viewers won't pick it up until it plays out.<br />Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are understated and perfect. Their characters are so solid, it's easy to forget that these are actors we've seen many times before, in other roles. The supporting cast is great as well.<br />The camera work is superb. In the greatest movies, the camera is not just a machine for recording the action, but is an active participant in telling the story. That is quite true here.<br />I seem to be draining the pool of adjectives dry of all compliments, but this film earns them. It's two and a half hours that will be some of the finest in your life.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|First off, I realize I should offer some background on myself to make any biased comments clear and obvious.  I have been and mostly likely will always be a Britney Spears fan.  To me, she has grown up beautifully in America's eyes and she will always be the top reigning pop princess.  To start off, saying that 'In The Zone' is the best album of hers, is over exxagerating.  I was dissapointed as a fan to be exposed to such poor vocals in this album.  It seems as time goes on, Britney's vocal ability is either degrading or she just can't sing any more.  'Oops', in my opinion, contained Britney's best vocals and her voice shined through.  However, 'In The Zone' offers a more mature Britney and proves that she is capable of writing songs, and I must admit she did a fine job at it.  I looked over at some other reviews and I decided I would add some of my own insight on her songs.<br />1. Me Against The Music- this song is by far the most 'hip' song off her new LP.  I guess you could say, that from the beginning, i fell in love with this song.  I find it extremely catchy and offered a new perspective towards Britney's music. 9/10<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom- the music is extremely fun and unique.  With the banjo and all, this song is fun and definitely club material.  I favor the idea of her collaborating with other musical artists, but The Ying Yang Twins was a poor choice.  Their 'rapping' is horrible and is not pleasing to the ear. 8/10<br />3. Showdown- this song also provides a new level to Britney's music and has rather interesting lyrics.  I must say that Britney is striving towards more controversial issues in her music.  8/10<br />4. Breathe On Me- this song is probably the best song off the album, in my opinion that is.  She 'states' not 'sings' about monogamy and the song is brilliantly done. 10/10<br />5. Early Mornin'- i dislike Moby and i resent that Britney chose to work with him.  This song is the only one of which i would skip and i would have preferred that she didnt add this song. 5/10<br />6. Toxic- toxic can easily be the most unique song off the album.  with its sultry vocals and Britney's voice at least being heard, it is great.  The incorporation of the violin and the funky music is perfect! 10/10<br />7. Outrageous- a good song, by any means, but becomes repetitive after a while. I amd ecstatic that she chose to work with R. Kelly. 7/10<br />8. Touch Of My Hand- this song is the most controversial song off the LP and is most pleasing to the ear.  Her vocals are on and off and the lyrics are empiracle.  Her creativity is becoming more and more mature and intelligent.  Say goodbye to the teeny-bopper girl. 10/10<br />9. The Hook Up- a good club song and very fun and up beat.  its tempo and music flow beautifully making this song a very enjoyable one. 9/10<br />10. Shadow- ah, yes, a slow song indeed.  While the lyrics are better off on her 'much too much pop' LPs, her vocal ability in this song may provide evidence that girlfriend can sang! a good song of course, just with porr lyrics. 8/10<br />11. Brave New Girl- this song is far too processed.  her rapping is not bad and the music and beats are tremendously catchy and entertaining.  However, this song shows more and more of Britney's use of processed work and less and less of her abilities. 6/10<br />12. Everytime- a beautiful ballad.  the perfect song after a break up which obviously shows a more mature side, rather than Justin's 'cry me a river', everytime is perfect in every way.  it is tranquil and less instrumental and background vocal and more focused on Britney herself and a near acapella. 10/10<br />13. Me Against The Music Remix- a well done remix. 9/10<br />Bonus Tracks: <br />14. The Answer- a perfect song that showcases Britney's new-reached vocal range.  this song is not offered to America, so it must be downloaded. 9/10<br />15. Dont Hang Up- another one of Britney's poorly sung songs and over processed songs.  6/10
B00009V7RF|5.0|I have only had this CD for a week and it's almost melted from neverending play. I have heard Where Is the Love on the radio before and I thought it was awesome, but I never thought to buy the CD. I love all of the songs, especially Anxiety, even though it's a rock song. Black Eyed Peas rocks!
B0000029DD|5.0|I stumbled upon this CD by accident, and it was the best accident I've ever had. The unmistakable falsetto voice of Jeff Buckley sounds almost ethereal at times on this CD.    The opening track is \\"Mojo Pin\\", one of my favorites for the raw emotion you can almost feel while listening to it. Next is the title track, \\"Grace\\", another highlight. It's haunting and the lyrics sound strangely like a foreshadow to his untimely end.    The third track is \\"Last Goodbye\\", which is sheer longing and another beautiful track. \\"Lilac Wine\\" sounds otherworldly, and is \\"heady\\" in the way it overcomes you. \\"So Real\\" is raw, emotion rock.    The next two tracks are the absolute standouts of the album. First is \\"Hallelujah\\". I love the original version and hate to discredit Leonard Cohen, but this is the way the song should be sung. Jeff's haunting voice fits perfectly with the haunting lyrics of this song. It's very different from another popular cover by Rufus Wainwright (another amazing artist) and it is perhaps the most beautiful song I've heard as of now. Next is \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\", another favorite that reminds me of past experience. A song about regrets and being afraid, it has some of the best lyrics on the CD, like \\"And maybe I'm too young/To keep good love from going wrong/But tonight you're on my mind/So you never know\\". You can feel pure raw emotion on this track and get lost in the song.    \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" -- the voice on this song. Wow. I cannot think of any other way to describe it other than heavenly. It simply sounds as though it was sung by an angel. The next song \\"Eternal Life\\" is a great contrast to \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\", but a good one. It shows another side of Jeff Buckley, that he is not all mournful and weepy music. More edgy and rock.    Last is \\"Dream Brother\\", which makes you feel sad listening to it. I've heard it was about his father (who also died young) and the relationship they never had, and this could very well be true. In eithercase, you feel the emotion. Best is the lyric \\"They're waiting for you like I waited for mine/And nobody ever came...\\"    This is no pop CD, nor is it one you should listen to if you like your music to fade into the background. Listening to this CD is a moving, almost religious experience. I cannot look at music in the same way and I know this will be in my player for years and years to come. It makes me want to mourn the loss of a man who died five years before I'd ever heard of him. This album is simply the story of the making of a man who never got to reach his destination.

B000084T18|4.0|One of the most talked about hip hop debuts of all times, 50 Cent may not have dropped a classic, but it's a great debut nevertheless. 50 Cent shines with the hits with \\"In 'Da Club\\", \\"P.I.M.P\\", \\"21 Questions\\" and \\"Wanksta\\" (which is an ode to Ja Rule). Other hits that may not have been as comercially successful maybe because 50 Cent didn't want to  stray into \\"pop-ville\\" are \\"Patiently Waiting\\", and \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\". Lyrically 50 Cent deliver his distinctive drawl on any track which is a high point. This CD may not be a classcal one like \\"Reasonable Doubt\\" (Jay-Z), \\"Doggystyle\\" (Snoop Dogg), or \\"Chronic\\" (Dr.Dre), but it is powerful enough to be maybe the best hip-hop album relesed in 2003
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana SUCKS, they SUCK, theyre a JOKE, they were nothing but a SELLOUT band for little KIDS who WISH they had something to CRY about - people who REALLY had a hard time in their lives listened to Pearl Jam; ALice in Chains; Soundgarden; &amp; the Smashing Pumpkins<br />Nirvana was nothing but a way for the TEENY BOPPERS to try to fit in with the scene, Nirvana SUCKS
B000060P79|1.0|The corporate world of MTV has done it again! Find a bunch of cutesy, clean-cut, clueless Canadians, and spoonfeed them a new &quot;image&quot;. Teach one to play a couple of chords, hand another drumsticks. Now, have some &quot;professional songwriters&quot; copy, verbatim, from some 12 year old's journal about how hard their life is, and feed these lyrics to a whiney singer. Oh yeah, and dont forget to make sure that said singer of these juvenile lyrics is at least 21! Best of all, dress the lot of them all &quot;punk&quot; with spikey hair, eyeliner, and ripped clothes! Wow! Now all the kids can be cool and stop listening to those sacharrine boy bands and listen to Simple Plan's &quot;rebellious&quot; music, shop at hot topic, and fuel the latest trends cooked up by scheming men in suits. It's such a shame that so few people manage to see through this disgusting act. Real music is supposed to capture the emotion of an artist. Whatever Simple Plan is, it CANNOT be called music.. it is a carefully created package that merely exploits a couple of young adults in pursuit of sucking the life out of the once-tolerable and fresh pop-punk scene. Many call this prefabricated C**p a mere extension of the boy-band pop genre, ranking with the likes of Backstreet Boys and NSync. But really, I have to give someone who is still a genuine BSC or Nsync fan way more credit than people who have &quot;matured&quot; into this Simple Plan B.s... at least they didnt jump on the latest ridiculous bandwagon.<BR>PS - you can fight back! listen to oldies! ever stop and wonder why we are still listening to such classics as the beatles and simon&amp;garfunkel? because these ARTISTS transcend time and trend. Wonder where Simple Plan will be even 5 years from now...
B00005RYL2|5.0|I'll say it up front - this movie is one of my top five of all time.  I knew none of the stars at the time (save Connery) and maybe this made the story all that better.  Why this particular film had (and has) such an attraction to the general public is not hard to figure out.<br />The premise, while seen elsewhere, is presented here with only a minimum of hokiness - no deep, theological, mythological or genetic explanations as to why the Eternals came to be - they just are.  The switch between 16th century Scotland and modern America was deft and non-obtrusive.  The acting was spectacular and bad boy Clancey Brown makes a strong, almost show stealing performance.  But it is Lambert in all his quixotic dry wit and somber moods that is the icing on the cake.  <br />Fantastic music - loved the ballade, great action scenes, just a perfect gem.  Then they had to go and try to ruin it with all the follow-ups (garbage), a TV series (It DOESN'T grow on you) the action game (my youngest son said it was &quot;crummy&quot;) and the Highlander toys.  How many movies have directors &quot;followed&quot; by a catastrophic sequeal?  Foreget all that stuff and buy or rent the DVD.
0451169514|5.0|First off, no offense to you Darren Burton but there are numerous false statements about this novel in which you put in your review. I will correct them here.<br /><br />Richie's brother (he didn't have one) did not die. It was Bill Denbrough's brother George.<br /><br />It wasn't Stan who saw the werewolf, it was Richie. Stan saw the dead boys.<br /><br />Mike showed them the photos in the Barrens. Not in a class report, that was only in the movie.<br /><br />Georgie died before they discussed Pennywise; in fact the losers didn't even really know each other that well when George died.<br /><br />The story begin with a boat, racing down a street after a flood. A little paper boat and a 6 year old little boy named George racing right behind it. Yellow rainslicker, smiles and all. Things however, take a turn for the worse for the poor kid when his boat falls right into a gutter. However, there's something down there, that had been lurking way before the town even had a name. IT's name is Pennywise the dancing clown (or Bob Gray if you prefer) and on that rainy day the story tells us, Pennywise would kill George Denbrough which started a snowball effect of events which would lead to one final showdown, long after that boat had been set out to sea.......<br /><br />William Denbrough, or Big Bill to his friends, or Stuttering Bill to bullies but also, Georgie's older brother. Tormented by the death/murder of his brother (and the effects it had on his parents), Bill carries on with life. 1957 turns into 1958 and Spring blooms. Something isn't right though. Other children have been killed. None molested...yet all brutally and savagely killed. Then something happens to Bill one day, something he would keep locked up in his heart for months. He looks through Georgie's picture book and the picture begins drawing blood from the edges and George's picture gives him a nice wink before Bill throws it while screaming. Then, unknown to him, a circle starts to form around him. One that would one May day in 1985 lead to the demise of this town evil. A circle of friends, Eddie, a small fragile boy with a protective mother and an aspirator in hand, one who looks up to Bill. Ben, a fat lovable young boy with a mind that could build anything and a heart capable of love much beyond the young boy he is. Beverly, a tough young lady with an abusive father, she is also the love interest of Ben. Richie, a young smart mouth with a thousand voices! Too bad they all sound the same. Stan, a nice quiet Jewish boy who just wants life to be organized and clean. Mike, the only black kid in all of Derry, often the  favorite target of bullies such as Henry, Belch and Victor. In the Summer of 1958 the story tells, these children shared a special bond. As the Summer wears on, they confess they all had encounters with Pennywise. Now perfectly sure that this was the one who killed his brother, Bill and his friends set out to defeat an eater of worlds.<br /><br />Bonded by blood, 27 years later, Bill, Eddie, Ben, Bev, Richie and Stan have all gone out into the world to become happy people and live comfortable rich lives. Little do they know (or even remember the evil in which they beat all those years ago) a Summer festival in july has come and gone in Derry and a childish Gay man, would set off a chain of events much like Georgie Denbrough did years ago. Adrian Mellon would be killed by Pennywise, being the first new victim. Mike Hanlon, town librarian/historian and one of the seven (the only one who stayed. A watcher of sorts), has stayed in Derry, once he finds out, that one 15 year old witness had mentionded a Clown in the Canal, eating Adrian Mellon; Mike knows what must be done. He would wait nearly a year to do it and numerous murders later. He would finally do it. He called each one up and told them to come back, that IT had come back. Slowly,their minds start rememebering the evil in which they fought and the battle they thought was over. Can they do it again?Can they go back in the wet darkness to face everything their childhood nightmares had been made of?<br /><br />This, is an amazing book. With a villain truly gripping and scary.

B000008LOV|5.0|These guys playing together produced  my all-time favourite album. Bought it on cassette when it first came out and can't think why i can't replace it - it's so hard to get on CD! It's one of those &quot;moments in time&quot; when great musicians get together &amp; you will never be able to replace/reproduce ever again.
B000001Y5X|4.0|Now This was a great cd by Mr. Manson and a great start as &quot;marilyn manson&quot; ( not including the spooky kids days) And before i review this album im tired of people saying how meaningless how my monkee is now it isn't his best song but it has meaning, In his Autobiography he even states that my monkee was similar to a charles manson song. This is not his best album though he hadn't fully evolved yet,hell, Manson keeps evolving today every album is different but many know that. The singles are well choosen ( get you gunn,lunch box and dope hat) and the guitars,bass and electronics are good sara lee (who sucked i  him out whom was replaced by long time member ginger fish, but thats a different story. In conclusion this is a very good and believe) played poorly on the drums Manson knew this and throughunique album not being his best but still being very good. I hope this review was helpful to you.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|I see that there are those that even today believe Clapton was/is better than Hendrix. Maybe Hendrix got too much publicity, but c'mon, his reputation is well deserved. I'm not saying Clapton was a mediocre player--he was pretty awesome himself. But with Jimi, you're going on a whole new level.The most barnburning Clapton solo ( Crossroads, White Room) sounds almost timid compared to almost anything Hendrix could do. And Clapton never could use his guitar to imitate a human voice, the way Hendrix could do. I  mean, most of Cream's improvisations were pretty random--Clapton merely played the same crap over and over, to the point that it was sometimes puke-inducing. Again this is not to belittle the considerable talent he has--its just that he was not the congenitally gifted improviser than Hendrix was, and marathon solos were never his thing; he should have stayed away from them altogether.I mean, everyone knows that Cream was finished the moment Hendrix came in........and for good reason.<BR>  And for that someone who thinks Hendrix's solos are a lot of fuzz, its precisely the nature of that preternaturally haunting sound that has befuddled and will continue to befuddle guitar players (and others)for decades;long after Clapton's relatively pedestrian playing is confined to the bin.
6305546789|5.0|The movie Haloween is my favorite horror movie of all time.Haloween with a great sotryline centers around Laurie strode (Jamie Lee Curtis)who is babysitting 2 kids on halloween.The Begining shows A Young Michael Myers killing his older sister.Dr Loomis then goes to the mental institution that Micahel is in He escapes on haloween night.The movie is great defenitly a favorite (I've seen a LOT of horror movies) this is my favorite maybe not the scariest defenitly not the goriest.But this movie stands the test of time-Own this movie.
B00001IVOF|5.0|This album is the darkest album, and is the best album Mobb Deep has done. Every track is dark as hell, there is no filler or pop tracks at all. This is the perfect album to put on if you angry and to play mad loud. Every track is hot, but the stand outs include Drop a Gem on em, Animal Instinct, Blood Sport, Extortion and GOD pIII. The Infamous cd was hot, but they take it to another level on this cd, there is absolutely no whack tracks.
B000056PWV|5.0|This thriller that starred James Stewart and Grace Kelly is one of the best Alfred Hitchcock movies I've seen. It is about a wheelchair-bound man (he broke his leg and had a cast) - played by James Stewart - who had nothing to do in his apartment for 6 weeks but just to watch his neighbors in a New York courtyard. One of his neighbors is a husband with an invalid wife...well, the wife disappeared and James' character put pieces together from his apartment to solve the murder. His fiancee (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter) helped him solve the case. I am not going to tell you the rest of the story, so go watch it! :)  There are intense scenes but very enjoyable. Great movie to show your kids or grandkids if they like suspense movies. I recommend this one.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Chris Cornell is simply one of the greatest voices in all of rock. Beginning and end of argument. Now, he has joined with the Rage Against the Machine guys, and they really show their true talents on this fantastic CD.  Seriously...these guys are AWESOME musicians, and it shows so much more here than on any Rage Against the Machine album.<br />Top to bottom, the album rocks.  It is a rarity...a complete album from start to finish.  Cornell really drives the album with his vocal range.  I am the Highway sticks out for Cornell...I can't stress how awesome he is.<br />Just get it!
B000002NIW|5.0|A Classic!  If you like KoRn, Slipknot, old Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Soulfly, you will love Deftones.  This is great album because it demonstrates Deftone's potential and skills!  From the beautiful melodies of Chino singing and yelling (I still cant figure out WTF is he saying sometimes - but it sounds good) to the heavy heavy riffs from the guitars - this album kicks major ass.  MY OWN SUMMER is a great aggressive track, and one of my personal favorite songs.  The entire album is great and is a variety of slow to hardcore moshing songs.  The blend of guitar tones and special effects is awesome and very original.  This is not your typical - I WANT TO KICK EVERYONES ASS album, its a collection of energetic songs mixed with emotional flowing songs.  How the DEFTONES put their tracks together is amazing - they combine soft melodies and beautiful singing with hard beats the next moment that makes you want to bang your head - few bands can produce songs like that.  Definately AROUND THE FUR should be on the top of your list to buy.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am not exactly a pop music fan to say the least, but I watched Britney's ABC special and as much as I knew that she was lip synching to all of the songs except for \\"Everytime\\", I still enjoyed it. Britney may not be the strongest singer, but she is an incredible entertainer. She knows what the audience wants and she always gives it to them, with all she has. She is a talented dancer, and that deserves some recognition. \\"In The Zone\\" has alot of great production, really tight beats, and unique vocal abilities. The great thing about this album is that it really seems to be more Britney than any of her previous albums, more songs written by her and more songs that reflect her personality. Clearly the best songs on the album are \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\", \\"Toxic\\", \\"Everytime\\", and the \\"Me Against The Music\\" remix is a million times better than the version that she released as her first single. This album has alot more sexually explicit lyrics and as a fan who isn't 13 anymore it's really refreshing, and all I have to say is rock on Britney!
B00008H2LB|5.0|OK!  If you have NOT listened to Hybrid theory - you are either deaf or are living in a cave!<br />I can still remember the days when I was on the street handing LP's promo tapes of &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;With You&quot; to people.  Even my most critical friends that are hardcore classical metal to trendy nelly fans LOVED what I gave them.  NOT a single negative review.  Linkin Park I personally knew and they are SOOOO down with the fans.  I musta received so much stuff from them - from backstage passes to signed posters and limited edition WarHall Original Artwork posters!  This album 0wnZ!  Almost as tight as Hybrid Theory, but still contains the essence that made LP so popular.  They are popular for a reason - dont hate them cuz they are liked...!  They make awesome music and thats just down.  I mean I like all music except country - and I can say LP really tries hard to do the very besy artistically!  Buy the album its worth every single penny!
B00003CXSM|5.0|First let me start by saying that this is definitely a chick flick, so guys, back off. Secondly, I LOVE THIS MOVIE! It's not just your typical boy-meets-girl movie...it's something I would've never expected! Who would've thought that he'd fall in love with his own wedding planner? That's crazy! Slightly unrealistic, but what movies ARE realistic these days? If you're the mushy-romantic-who-cries-at-every-movie type, this movie is definitely for you.
B00000JCOV|5.0|OK the contraversy with Mushroomhead which is a cool band, but SlipKnot I believe is better.  Wearing masks and refered as numbers, with 3 drummers, a dj, and typical band members makes for some crazy original band.  Besides that, they put on an incredible live show that is such as deal.  From diving off the speaker tower from 40feet onto the stage, to lighting themselves on fire, to physically attacking each other, slipknot is by far the craziest live performances I have witnessed.  Better than Seigfred and Roy tiger show...LOL!  Anyways, this album is one of my personal favorites.  It incorporates heavy metal mixed with some great vocals.  Corey Taylor (#8) provides beautiful singing with yelling and flows incredibly.  He really made the band successful.  The other members are cool also, but having so many members they provide a unique sound that cannot be reproduced with 3 drummers and 2 guitarists mixed with a dj and much more.  Slipknot is definately something you should listen to and buy if you havent.  Its a great album that I stand by and I believe there is 2 versions one is editted due to legal issues with one of the songs.  SlipKnot is heavy and emotional but a truely musical masterpiece.  BUY IT!
B00008NRI8|3.0|There's nothing really special about this movie...it's such a cliche story and just feels tired and boring. Believe me, I usually love any-and-all chick flicks, but this one just doesn't appeal to me. Pick something else instead.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|When I started watching this DVD I was expecting bad sound quality like buzzing vocals and drumming that doesn't match up with the sound. However, I was blown away by the absolute perfection in sound quality, as well a picture quality. This DVD could be made into a live cd it's so good. This is a MUST buy for any Chili Peppers fan!!
B0000TB014|4.0|1.  Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough<br />2.  Rock With You<br />3.  Billie Jean<br />4.  Beat It<br />5.  Thriller<br />6.  Bad (short version)<br />7.

You Rock My World (excludes beginning few minutes)<br />The very basic packaging tells you that this is a no frills DVD.  Many of MJ's best videos are presented and that is all you get.  No fancy menu or insert.  No live performances, interviews, commercials or still gallery.  Nothing.  Not even a discography.  This doesn't cut it in this day and age of DVD.  The videos are great, but this is hardly a difinitive collection.  Expecially since all of these (save &quot;You Rock My World&quot;) are already available on other discs.  And why do video collections keep getting released with shortened or re-edited videos?  We want the FULL original video ok!  Is that too much to ask?<br />It's hard to go wrong with an MJ music video and these are all great.  But this DVD could have (and should have) been definitie.  Instead it's just yet another collection of videos collectors already have.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I have waited for this CD and all I can say is I am glad I bought it on sale because I dont feel so bad about throwing away $$. \\"In the Zone\\" is one of the better songs on this CD and there is a track you can down load called \\"I've just began having fun\\". Other wise all the other tracks are her story telling of how she is now a woman etc-blah -blah - we know you had sex tell us something else. If I were you listen to it on-line before you buy - you will save yourself the time and money- sorry Britney - please try again- we dont like your \\"Zone\\"!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This has quickly become one of my all time favorite movies.  The give and take (Arnold gives, Lou takes) between Schwarzenegger and Ferigno is simply classic.  The making of the movie portion of the dvd is even more interesting than the movie.  A definite must have for anyone who claims to be a fan of Arnold and/or bodybuilding.

B0000D96NW|5.0|First off, I have to say that every review posted here is true. This is Machine Head's finest master piece to date. I've been an MH fan since Burn My Eyes, I've bought every album, seen MH live 14 times now. Why this album has been held up by Roadrunner USA is beyond me. Good job Roadrunner UK for picking this album up! <br />Through The Ashes Of Empires is worth buying right now! Don't wait till it gets to the United States. Buy the import! Worth every penny! You will not be disappointed! Absolutely MH's best album to date. If you liked Burn My Eyes, You will love Through The Ashes Of Empires! I haven't been able to stop playing this album over and over since I got it. Robb Flynn and MH get 5 stars from Nor Cal Thrashers!!!!<br />THIS ALBUM IS HELLA AWESOME!
B00005QZ7U|2.0|With such an all-star cast, Moulin Rouge was one of the biggest movies released that year. However I'm one of those who disagree with the great ratings it received... There's nothing wrong with the acting... just the plot is so ridiculous and I felt silly watching it. It tries to be fairy-tale-like in an adult sort of way... to me these 2 just don't mix very well... I'd prefer either the one genre or the other. The songs were great remakes of old-time classics from musicals and bands, which I really enjoyed being a music lover myself. I think if not for the songs, I would have walked out of the movie 30 minutes into the show. Perhaps its true what people say : you either love this or hate this. Watch it at your own risk (of disappointment, of course).

B000021Y77|4.0|The movie is about the story of Lola(Franka Potente) who promised her boyfriend Manni (Maritz Bleibtreu) that she would find him 10000 DMs in 20 minutes, and if she failed to appear he would go rob the supermarket. Its not the greatest storyline in the world and the characters in the movie have the amazing capacity to do the most stupid, impulsive things without thinking first, but I must say that I enjoyed the whole movie from start to end and watched it twice, first by myself then with my husband. The comic quality of this movie is dry but good, and its pace is fast which means that you hardly have time to think or predict what the character is going to do next before they do it. The soundtrack is the style of authentic German trance-techno music... which pleased my husband a great deal because he's a German trance-techno fan. This is definitely no quiet, emotional drama... the characters are brash and act and say whatever they want. If you watch the DVD version you can choose to watch the movie in its original German version with English subtitles, or you can choose to watch it in an English-dubbed version. My personal preference is the original German version with English subtitles. The other English-dubbed version I find really irritating because they don't even dub it word for word... original swear-words in German are substituted by tame and ridiculously stupid English words which many of us don't even use in our daily life for swearing or expressing anger. Not only that, the dubbing is unemotional (sounds like the English-dubbers they use to dub Japanese cartoons into English) and it sounds plastic and lacks the real depth of feeling that the original German version contains.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Metallica took a big risk performing with the San Francisco Symphony as the result could have swung either way. However, being Metallica and all, they do not dissapoint one bit. James' vocals are very powerful and sound amazing. All the bands playing is to perfection. The songs sound great with the symphony and the whole concert was a huge success. Even the really heavy songs sound kool on here and this dvd is one more success for Metallica........this dvd is well worth the money!
B0000542DJ|5.0|You have to approach Oliver Stone's JFK in two ways: first as a motion picture, then as a representation of history.  It is often hard to separate the two, but one must never forget that this is a movie, a dramatization that features a number of added fictional elements to make it more poignant and gripping.  How true a representation of Garrison's life and work is this?  I can't say for sure, as I have focused most of my attention on the work and ideas of a number of other dedicated researchers, having always regarded Garrison's case as tangential at best.  Garrison, even with a little fictional help from Oliver Stone, never had much of a case against Clay Shaw, but the evidence he puts forth in his unwinnable case does, to my mind, satisfactorily prove that there was a conspiracy involving unknown individuals to kill the President.  Still, though, this is an over dramatized production wherein a number of facts are tweaked, created, changed, or deleted; Garrison is a controversial figure who comes off much better here than he does in real life, so one can certainly not accept this film as fact.  I have read and studied the JFK assassination at some length, and I consider Garrison's case an interesting but rather small, gnarled limb on the tree of conspiracy; there are a number of far larger and weightier limbs on that tree, and when these are eventually hacked down and fall at the foot of the American people, the whole world will be rocked by the force and immensity of the event, and the reverberations of that fall will echo throughout all of our future history.<br />JFK succeeds admirably as a movie.  The blending together of actual footage and historical re-creations in a sometimes almost surreal way is very effective, the humanity, passion, and integrity of Jim Garrison shines out like a beacon of truth, and Garrison's passionate closing argument is emotionally powerful and believable.  The film is rather graphic, but it has to be.  One of the reasons I bought this movie when it came out was its inclusion of the Zapruder film, the key piece of evidence that, among other things, shows the horrible force and destruction of the kill shot.  Autopsy scenes and photos, both real and re-created, may also be disturbing to some, but they are historically accurate.  The film features an incredible number of well-known actors and actresses: Kevin Costner, whom I don't really like as a general rule, delivers a truly powerful performance; Sissy Spacek is certainly convincing as Garrison's annoying, emotionally torn wife; Brian Doyle-Murray makes a convincing Jack Ruby; and Gary Oldman simply is Lee Harvey Oswald.  An almost unrecognizable Tommy Lee Jones brings Clay Shaw to memorable life, but the finest performance here, in my opinion, is that of Joe Pesci in his role of the unforgettable real-life character David Ferrie.  Great actors such as Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, John Candy, Walter Matthau, and Kevin Bacon are brilliant in small yet important roles.  Jim Garrison himself even makes an appearance as, of all people, Earl Warren.<br />JFK doesn't have very many answers, but it asks a lot of the right questions.  The one problem this film has, though, is the fact that it covers so much information and characters.  Those who have not studied the assassination in any depth before, those who have not read such material as Stone drew heavily from (principally Jim Marrs' Crossfire and the research of Robert Groden), may find themselves a little overwhelmed by too much information, much of it presented in the form of rapid-fire dialogue and dream-like video montages.<br />This movie, much like Garrison's case, spread the word to the public at large; it exposed the shadows of dark, mysterious forces whose possible connection to the assassination has never been fully explored; it tore down the incredibly shaky conclusion of the Warren Commission; it pointed fingers not so much at individuals and groups of possible conspirators as it pointed the finger of truth at the American public.  We all deserve to know the truth about Kennedy's assassination, and it is up to us to demand and get that proof, to tear down the walls of secrecy and confidentiality behind which what is left of the evidence lies, to take our country back from the kinds of men who would engineer a brutal public murder and then secretly change the entire course of our great republic for the worse.  I think that anyone who looks at this case will know that the government has lied to us all for the past forty years.  That's not really the point of this film, though.  JFK compels you to look at the evidence yourself, it exhorts you not to take the government at its word without sufficient proof, and it expresses the qualities a great nation must rediscover if it is to prosper in the future.ators as it pointed the finger of truth at the American public.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|This album is not really good and not really bad, and the song &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; (featuring Madonna), is not bad, but the rest of the songs are kind of ok, I guess, I mean, the songs are not bad or anything, but it's just that she was much better off when she first came out with &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; in 1999. So, this album is ok. That's why I have it 4 stars. The only song that I think is the best on the album is &quot;Everytime&quot;.
B0000E1WNV|4.0|It has never been a better time to be a Springsteen fan, with loads of material old and new coming along in the form of a new album, multiple tour dates, and a host of other activity. There have also been two live DVDs, which is perhaps the most enjoyable of all. The first, \\"Live in New York City\\" was fantastic, and this new one, \\"Live In Barcelona\\", provides Springsteen fans with a show from \\"The Rising Tour\\". It has more than it's share of classic moments, but with a few downsides that might turn some off. Read on...<br />Stating the obvious, you get your money's worth. The concert is 2.5 hours, and filled with a wealth of material old and new. The show was recorded in Barcelona in front of a loud and ravenous crowd who knew all the words to every song, and were not above jumping up and down during the best songs. Highlights from \\"The Rising\\" include the title track (which opened the show), \\"Waitin' on a Sunny Day\\" (which saw a huge audience sing-along and Bruce do his famous slide), and the gorgeous \\"Countin' on a Miracle\\". But the biggest cheers were saved for the classics, and they were well spread across Bruce's career. There was \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\", \\"Badlands\\", Thunderoad\\", and the requisite \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" and a rocky version of \\"Dancing in the Dark\\". Disappointingly absent were stapled \\"Jungleland\\", \\"The River\\", \\"Out in the Street\\", and \\"Rosilita\\". But who can complain with all the good songs that did make it?<br />The concert transfer is, however, a hit and miss affair. On one hand, the concert was well shot and edited, though not as well as \\"Live in New York\\". But as one reviewer said, the sound quality is abysmal at times. It gets tinny and harsh, and there are times when the instruments and crowd noise overrides the vocals. Most Springsteen fans know all songs by heart, so this might not be the biggest inconvenience. One way around this is to choose \\"Dolby Surround\\" in the Audio Setup menu, which helps relieve the problem somewhat. Another letdown is the bonus documentary \\"Drop the Needle and Pray\\", which clocks in at less than 9 minutes and acts as merely a teaser. It is very similar to the \\"New York City Serenade\\" doc found on the \\"Live in New York City\\" DVD. There are no other extras, which is a bit of a letdown.<br />All said, it is still great to have a concert from \\"The Rising\\" tour on DVD, since the new songs sound excellent and mix well with the old material. And with only a few repeated songs from \\"Live in New York City\\", it is good to own alongside the other DVD. I would highly recommend it, despite a few drawbacks.er letdown is the bonus documentary \\"Drop the Needle and Pray\\", which clocks in at less than 9 minutes and acts as merely a teaser.

B0000E1ALR|4.0|Bruce Springsteen has such a massive back catalogue of both released and unreleased material that it would be impossible to totally make an \\"Essential\\" collection on 2 CDs alone. And while \\"The Essential Bruce Springsteen\\" is the first comprehensive collection of Springsteen songs that spans his entire career, there are many great songs left out and more than a few repeats from the single disk Greatest Hits that was released in 1995.<br />The \\"Essential\\" package, essentially, takes the title song from each album and adds in another popular hit for good measure. Each album has two songs to represent it, with the exception of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" and \\"The Rising\\", which have three songs and the most obvious choices. This is not a bad thing mind you, but it will leave you with the feeling that his best albums were under-represented. I would have liked more songs from \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" and \\"The River\\". But what pleased me what that it includes some of Springsteen's best songs that didn't make it onto the Greatest Hits CD, including \\"Rosalita\\", \\"Jungleland\\", and \\"Blinded by the Light\\". Also included are the two tracks from \\"Live in New York City\\", \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\" and \\"American Skin (41 Shots)\\", which is great for people who don't own the \\"Live in New York City\\" 2 CD set.<br />The version I bought has the coveted third disc of rarities and unreleased extras. It is hit and miss, clocking in at 47 minutes and including some duds among the gold. \\"Missing\\" and a wonderful live version of \\"Trapped\\" are mixed with a totally unnecessary version of \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" and a horrible acoustic version of \\"Countin' on a Miracle\\", which sounds like it was recorded in a bar with a tape recorder. I can see why this third disc steamed some people, because with a wealth of unreleased material, they could have do so much better, in terms of quality and quantity.<br />\\"The Essential Bruce Springsteen\\" is a good career-spanning retrospect of his career, and is a great introduction for newer fans.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Did anyone listen to this cd??  The sound is so over-produced and processed in order to hide Britney's weak voice.  Yes, there is some decent beats in the cd but let's not get too excited.  The first single with Madonna is a joke...awful!  Looks like JLo finally has some company.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I haven't reviewed a cd on Amazon (or anywhere else) for about 4 years.  This band compelled me to write one.  People, listen up.  This is the best metal cd, top to bottom, I own.  These guys combine elements of hardcore, black metal, punk, old school, emo, doom, you-name-it metal into the most interesting, tightest metal I have ever heard.  [...]  They all just slid down a notch on my list of greatest albums.  This thing is epic.  I'm not even going to try to break it down.  Every song (except maybe 8) rates 10/10. It's over 60 minutes long.  Just get the [...]thing.

B000002GOZ|5.0|This CD really blew me away! Each and every track is fabulous and the unplugged sounds makes every tune even better than the original one! I have had this CD for almost 3 years now and I can't stop listenig to it. This is one you gotta have...Bryan Adams is at his best, and the choice of tunes is really perfect. Personnaly, there is not one track that I don't like. I'm ready is absolutely fabulous ( the best ballad i've ever heard) and this cd will put you on a good mood every time you'll listen to it. THis album really is a pure joy...
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is one HOT DVD, Shania gives one heck of a performance.  I truly enjoyed the whole show and would really like to go see her in person!! A must have DVD for any Shania fan.  My hats off to Shania and the UP DVD!! Absolutely Amazing.
0688163173|5.0|Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels arrives at Shutter Island looking for proof of a terrible conspiracy--he has evidence that the doctors at the Island's mental institution are engaging in experiments similar to those undertaken by the Nazis. Together with his partner, Chuck Aule, Teddy begins by investigating an impossible escape. Although the doctors seem compassionate, Teddy knows that something isn't right. And when he begins feeling physical symptoms, he suspects that he will not be allowed off the island again. Yet, the escaped woman seems to be sending him messages in code, messages that might reveal what he needs to escape and to reclaim his own life.<br />Author Dennis Lehane writes a compelling suspense novel. War hero Teddy Daniels is a fascinating character, haunted by the death of his wife and the man who killed her--a man he knows to be on the island. He soon learns that, with drugs, the boundary between sanity and insanity is not always clear--and may be controlled by others.<br />SHUTTER ISLAND is a fascinating examination of a man. Daniels's questions about sanity, about government research, and about the line between justice and revenge are fundamental issues both for the character and for everyone, adding depth to the story. Lehane's strong writing propells the reader through the story just as Daniels is propelled from one danger to the next.<br />The novel is a quick read, but it is one of those stories that sticks with you, repaints your memories--and the way you see the world. Highly recommended.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Many reviews already exist for this masterfull score, but I add mine at this date after viewing the documentary on the creation of the score on the Extended Edition of the Two Towers DVD.  This is an extraordinary piece of musical work.  The first score rightly won the Academy Award.  This score takes the themes from the first film and weaves them in, using them as foundations for any even bigger and more impressive score for the second film.  Not only does the music tightly bind the second movie to the first, but it also elaborates the cultural and emotional geography of the second film with entirely new themes and amazing vocal pieces which are deeply affecting and moving.  I like this whole score, but I am especially moved by the themes created for Rohan and for Eowyn.  The use of the Hardinger fiddle wonderous.  The music that narrates the triumphant end of the Battle of Helms Deep and the music that accompanies the destruction of Isengard are also very effective and powerful.  All this said, where was the Academy last year?  Howard Shore did something few composers can, he reinvented an award winning score and rather than coasting with the old material, he created even more powerful music erected on the foundation of his initial work.  The second score extends and exceeds the first.  Yet he was not even nominated.  I don't even remember what music was honored.  This score, however, will be in my library and come to me at meaningful emotional moments for years to come.  It does not disappoint.  The Academy had better be awake for the Return of the King, because I fully expect Howard Shore to continue his amazing composition to the end.
B00009TB5G|5.0|It's really amazing the whole package is great. The extra scenes are worth the price alone. The fellowship of the ring had slightly more cast interviews but this fantastic a must have ...
0385504209|1.0|I am sorry I could not give this book less than one star. To see what others write about this being a &quot;great book&quot; not only in the literary but also in the historical and religious sense, makes one sad at the realisation that these people have such a poor culture and idea regarding literature, history and religion.<br />It is also sad to see that whenever someone publishes a book, article, musical album, or anything containing a statement which could be considered racist, anti-semitic, or offensive to women, homosexuals, or any religious or ethnic minorities, the author is disqualified almost immediately and there is great public outrage. However, when someone attacks the Catholic Church and christianity in general, somehow it's OK. How exactly is this fair!? Where is the respect, tolerance, political-correcteness, open-mindedness and all those things which most people and some groups are so zealous to demand but, apparently, unwilling to give others?! As a Catholic, I am taught by my Church not only to respect but, moreover, to LOVE all persons regardless of the sinfulness of their personal actions, which, however, does not at any time mean that I must also condone such deeds.<br />It is also ridiculous to see phrases such as &quot;exhaustively researched&quot; used to qualify the author's work. An example: the author particularly attacks the Vatican ([...]) and Opus Dei ([...] and he claims, among many other outrageously false absurdities, that Opus Dei has &quot;monks&quot; who wear habits. It would have taken him less than five minutes to visit that organization's website to read a brief description of it and see that there are no such things as monks or habits in Opus Dei, which is a lay organization that promotes a lay spirituality. This book is a work of fiction, and promoting it as anything more is dishonest to readers, and disrespectful to the faith of millions of Catholics and other Christians.<br />His work is based on esoteric and completely unfounded legends regarding Mary Magdalene and Jesus. The author and his readers are apparently more convinced by ficticious and fantasized works about the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar and other such things, than by almost 2,000 years of serious historical and biblical research by respected and qualfied professionals, christian and non-christian, religious and secular, etc. (By the way, --for those interested in these subjects,-- for a professionally researched and objectively presented history of The Knights Templar, I recommend the work of historian Piers Paul Read, &quot;The Templars&quot;).<br />I wish to end with a quote from Thomas Roeser in the 27 September 2003 edition of The Chicago-Sun Times: &quot;The Da Vinci Code is only the latest crude assault, as frightening in its own way as were recent demonstrations by mobs at Catholic cathedrals in New York City and Montreal (no ''hate crime'' sanctions were invoked there). That this erratic tale will soon fade away will be fitting justification for a church whose founder died, out of love, for man's redemption and prophesied its unending persecution -- but also that will endure to the end of time&quot;.unfounded legends regarding Mary Magdalene and Jesus.

B000084T18|1.0|How old are you 7?  50 Cent's album is full of crap fads.  On every track you know Eminem is ghostwriting and the only good parts are the hot sounds created by Dr. Dre.  He and Ja are so fixated on each other its sickening.  If you want to find a good NY rapper check out The Notorious B.I.G.
B00005JMFO|4.0|This is such a great movie. Take someone that you really care about and go see it, you will appreciate him or her that much more. This is an enjoyable, fun holiday movie for adults. Hugh Grant is great, absolutely hilarious (think Bridget Jones or Two Weeks Notice).
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am a dyed in the wool Broadway musical purist, which means that I hardly ever like the movie versions of a show that started on Broadway. This is a notable exception. I actually think this musical works better on the big screen than on the stage, which is a huge concession from me. The casting and performances are fabulous. The film techniques add punch to the storyline. The costuming is stunning. I can't get enough of this film!<br />My only regret is that they didn't make a movie of the original cast, too. Oh, to have seen Chita Rivera (in the role she originated instead of just a bit part), Gwen Verdon, and Jerry Orbach!
B00008EY9G|3.0|Identity is an excellent thriller-suspense movie.  What I thought might turn into yet another hokey ghost/devil/serial killer flick was actually an original piece of entertainment...until the last few minutes when the writer inexplicably fell on an unecessary B-movie plot twist.  A shame really since this was a movie I was going to watch a few times, but will now collect dust on the &quot;ehh&quot; DVD pile.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Well, as a self-proclaimed Britney-hater, I was surprised when she released \\"Slave 4 U\\" a while back. It sounded like Prince to me and I actually liked it (Shocking!). So when I had a chance to listen to a pre-release of this album, I was a little more open to listening to it. <br />The Britney on this new album is a lot more grown up, and she seems to have shed the little-girl-pop-princess persona.  That's not to say that these songs aren't Top-40 material, they're just a little more club-themed.  (No doubt from her much publicized partying). Best songs are \\"The Hook Up\\" which has a catchy reggae theme, the Moby produced \\"Early Morning\\",  the Kylie Minogue sounding \\"Breathe on Me\\", and the infectious \\"Showdown\\" which I'm sure will get plenty of publicity with the \\"I don't really want to be tease, would you undo my zipper please?\\" lyric. Toxic is sure to be a hit.<br />There's lots to dislike on this album though:  \\"Brave New Girl\\" sounds like it belongs in the next Legally Blonde movie and doesn't fit it here, the very personal \\"Everytime\\" did nothing for me (But will get loads of scrutiny from the Justin Timberlake crowd), I didn't care for \\"Outrageous\\" because she's trying way to hard to be cool.  Same goes for the ... themed \\"Touch of my Hand.\\" <br />All in all, I give her props for trying something new, which is hard to do in the music business. And for anyone out there who disses her for being too sexual obviously doesn't remember their early 20's when sex and sexuality was a new found power. No, she's not a grown up yet, but she's trying.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|Being an enormous whitney fan I bought this album expecting to hear some of my favorite christmas classics sung by a powerful voice, but I was regretfully disappointed. She just doesn't sound like the whitney of before. Aside from her voice, the way the songs were produced did not impress me one bit. It's too R'nB for a christmas album. I had planned to buy this CD for my friends as stocking stuffers but I will definetly not be doing that. I might have to pick up celine or mariah's x-mas CD's instead.
B000005HO0|4.0|About a year ago, I posted a less-than-favorable review of 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas', wherein I basically took issue with that album's lack of anything interesting to offer musically compared to other Norwegian black metal acts, and it's absolutely pathetic vocals courtesy of Attila. My feelings still haven't changed, but to be honest, I have to admit my liking of 'Live In Leipzig'.<br />The most obvious difference here is the vocals. This is the only official Mayhem release with Dead at the microphone, and it's pretty easy to see why he's sorely missed. His tortured blowtorch style makes the music sound truly hateful and malevolent, and in a way, his voice almost becomes another instrument. He doesn't so much growl or shriek, but rather simply yells in this horrifying tone, and somehow it works exceedingly well! Also, the crudeness of the recording somehow makes the material sound much colder and blacker, especially the tone of Euronymous' guitar. This truly is black metal stripped down to it's absolute basics, and while the sound quality is really quite bad in places (there's a noticable tape &quot;glitch&quot; in the middle of &quot;The Freezing Moon&quot; that leads you to believe that this may have originally been a bootleg), the atmosphere is intact, something that 'DMDS' was sorely lacking, maybe due to the clean production which didn't suit the music at all.<br />If you only buy one Mayhem CD, do yourself a favor and make it this one; it pretty much makes all their others unnecessary.
B000003C4K|5.0|i will put it simple if you are interested in this style of music(thrash) this cd has to be in your collection.this album belongs in the top 2 of all time.i could'nt tell you how many times i have bloodied my knuckles in the pit to this album.and to the guy  in one of the other reviews who was putting slayer down obviously does not respect the 80's thrash movement.slayer is still kicking after more than 20 years of keeping to their roots.mosh it.
B000060P79|1.0|no simple plan god doesnt hate you he hastes us for creating you and your horrible band. god even fans of pop punk (good charlotte, nfg, sum 41, etc) think you are big whiney losers. my god you are like 25 and stating your just a kid. hello time lapse! oh and they are not even original enough to create their own song ideas. christ how many more bands are gonna piss and moan cause there daddy didnt like them being in a band?

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has made yet another hit! In the Zone, is an awesome calabiration of music! Better then all 3 of the other albums! Weither you like rap or pop, you'll love this cd!
B00005KARK|4.0|I'm a college student and have begun rebuying all my old disney favorites. I can understand why parents of younger children(7 and under) would not want them to watch Dumbo, although the movie is a classic and it is an amazing experience to go back and look at the old animation and compare it to today's standards. I actually wrote an english paper on this movie this year- comparing my views on it from when I was little to my current age. NOTE TO CONCERNED PARENTS- I owned Dumbo when I was little (I'm 19..so...) and I only remembered the vaguest parts of it- I knew his mom tried to protect him and got taken away, he learned to fly with a feather, he made friends with a mouse, and I remembered the creep pink elephants he sees. Other than that- nothing. As long as you watch it with them and say, &quot;Thats not very nice of them is it? What would you say?&quot; They're really not going to remember the details of it in the long run anyway. :)
B000002UWL|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  My favorite PSB CD.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a really cute movie that the whole family will love. The graphics are great, and the familiar voices are charming. It's a touching story about a fish named Nemo and his father, who don't get along at the beginning. It's the whole 'I'm-growing-up-leave-me-alone' kind of relationship. But Nemo's father who can't help it because he's a little insecure, and because of a tragic event (it happens at the very beginning of the movie, but I still don't want to spoil it) in his life, he's afraid of Nemo's safety. When Nemo is caught by scuba divers and is stuck in an aquarium of a dentist's office in Australia, his father immediately tries to find him. He finds a new friend Dorry, a fish with a terrible memory, and also meets some other friends (and fiends) along the way. It's a very funny movie and will keep you laughing even when you watch it the second time.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying :D.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|I've seen FOTR about 10 times - maybe not into the hardcore fan category, but it's definitely my favorite movie. (with the exception of TTT!) I bought the soundtrack after seeing the movie 3 or 4 times. It's amazing! If I'm somewhere where I don't have a DVD player, I pop in the CD and it's like reliving the whole movie!! I hear this little choral section, and I can see in my head the innkeeper hiding behind the doorway at the Prancing Pony while the ringwraiths stomp by...I hear another instrumental part and can see the fellowship running across the Bridge in the mines. This is definitely the most amazing filmscore soundtrack I've ever heard, and I highly recommend it especially if you have the movie almost memorized!
B00006F7S4|5.0|This album is nothing like anything Beck has ever done.  Previous CDs have blended up-beat hip-hop, synthesizers, rock, and funk.  Sea Change is a very deep and somber folk CD that really highlights Beck as a musician and singer.<BR>  I'm not really sure what has happened to Beck Hansen over the years, but he has gotten very introspective.  The once high-energy Beck has changed to melodic, and the listener seems to feel saddened by the end of the Album.<BR>   Musically, vocally and lyrically, this is one of the finest CDs to be produced in years; however, massive commercial success has not followed for one reason: this is a Beck CD.<BR>   Up-tempoed fans of prior Beck hate this folk CD, while folk listeners will not go near a Beck CD, let alone buy it.  I happen to enjoy folk and melodic ballads, as well as &quot;classic Beck.&quot;  If you are open minded or like acoustic music, I highly recommend Sea Change.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Like millions of other people I could not stand Britney for the longest time.  I listened to snippets of her other songs on iTunes with an open mind, because there are lots of people out there who don't like Christina Aguilera, but I love her.  But after listening to the clips of her other songs I realized that the only songs that were any good on her albums were already released as singles; everything else was pure filler.<BR>When this album came out I still listened to the clips of her songs on iTunes, still with an open mind, but expecting to walk away with the same impression of this effort as with her past efforts.  I was quite surprised.  I walked away from my computer, listened to the 30-second clips a few more times, and was astounded that I actually liked almost all of the songs.  I wound up buying the album and I actually don't regret the purchase.  There are a couple of ballads on there that are either just plain silly or they haven't grown on me yet (there are two of those songs on Justin's &quot;Justified&quot; that I hated at first but love now, so these might still grow on me!), and &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; seems like a silly attempt to gain sensationalist recognition, but other than that I really like this whole album.<BR>People need to realize something about Britney.  They seem to keep expecting that in order for her to prove her worth she has to get a voice like Christina's, or at least get as good as someone like Shania (okay, different genre but vocally it's the middle-ground I was going for in that analogy).  People do not turn to Hostess expecting to find health food.  They expect Twinkies and cupcakes and such, and in that right they are very good at what they do.  Britney is to the music world what Hostess is to the food world.  Don't expect stellar vocals from this woman because she just plain doesn't have it.  But another reviewer hit the nail on the head: Madonna does not win any vocal awards but she is immensely popular because she is an excellent entertainer, and is an expert at marketing herself.  Britney is Madonna's successor, which appears to be symbolized by Madonna's collaboration with her on &quot;Me Against the Music.&quot;<BR>One of the main reasons I bought &quot;In the Zone&quot; was because I figured that if I didn't like it that much after all, it would at least be great gym music.  It is.  The beats really get me going in the morning during my runs.  Plus, I have to give Britney some credit for writing some of the songs on this album.  About time she did that.  <BR>In any  case, if you listen to &quot;In the Zone&quot; and actually don't like the music,  fine.  But don't judge her  for not having wonderful vocal abilities, because that's not what she's here for.   She's here to be eye and ear candy.  If you want substance,  turn to Christina Aguilera.  But in its own right &quot;In the Zone&quot; is a highly enjoyable album, and having hated Britney for so long I'm quite surprised to say that.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|No other band in history has done more to influence society and culture than the Beatles did after some 8 years together and a dozen studio LPs. The Beatles are responsible for a lot of \\"firsts\\" in recorded history -- taking recorded music in the studio to the absolute limits, experimenting with different sounds and musical influences, and printing the song lyrics on the LP or cover sleeve. Even after the Beatles disbanded in 1970, their mesmerizing affect on society is still felt. Indeed, there will never be another band like the Beatles.  The music in \\"Let it Be. . . Naked\\" has been available to Beatles fans through bootleg recordings for many years. The sound quality in a few of these bootleg editions is quite good. But, in others. . . well, you know. . . . \\"caveat emptor,\\" especially when it comes to underground music recordings.   This recording, however, gives the listener a fresh perspective on the \\"Get Back\\" sessions. For openers, the tapes have been remastered and cleaned, providing excellent sound quality. Although Beatles fans are familiar with the songs on this CD, the warmth and freshness of an \\"un-spector-ized\\" recording session is felt throughout the CD. This is the way the Beatles wanted \\"Let It Be\\" to be released in the first place. Gone are the Phil Spector orcestra and choral affects and the interlude pieces -- \\"Maggae Mae\\" and \\"Dig It.\\" Instead, an outstanding uptempo version of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" has been added. The studio banter heard on the original \\"Let It Be\\" LP has also been eliminated, except for Lennons famous: \\"I hope we passed the audition\\" at the end of the CD.   I do not believe that this is Sir Paul McCartney's attempt to rewrite the Beatles' Legacy. Ringo Starr and George Harrison (to a degree) agreed on this project. Yoko Ono also agreed with this project. As a matter of fact, Ringo Starr give this release a powerful endorsement prior to its release. McCartney may have a big ego. But, that is not the case with this recording. Thisis, simply, releasing \\"Let It Be\\" the way the Beatles had intended it to be released.   ...Overall, in my opinion, this is a good CD that die-hard and casual Beatles fans can appreciate. And, Yes, the band has passed the audition. . . . . Again!
B00005JM02|5.0|It woudln't be an understatement to say that Pixar Animation Studios is really pushing the envelope in how real a computer animated film can be. Finding Nemo is everything we've come to expect in a Disney/Pixar featuer, and then some. There is comedy, drama, and truly heartfelt emotion as Marlin the clownfish searches for his lost son Nemo. The story is superb, the writing is sharp, the vocalwork is fantastic. And then there are the visuals. To say the least, Pixar has outdone itself when it comes to the detail, richness, and realness of the animation in Nemo. Simply put, you FEEL like you're in a vast underwater world. Light bends and shimmers around the water, you see particles float, shadows look realstic, refraction looks like it should, overall, it looks incredibly REAL. Pixar definately deserves awards for the quality of the animation here.<br />As for the DVD, it too is a winner. Packed with two versions of the film (wide and fullscreen), and hours of wonderful bonus featuers for both kids and digital animation enthusiasts alike. The transfer is superb (not hard seeing the film's digital roots, like Star Wars: Attack of the Clones), and the sound quality is excellent.<br />The bottom line? Nemo is a DVD that everyone should have in their collection, without a doubt.
B000089RVR|5.0|This album is not as good as No Angel, but still it's great. I think rhythms and instrumentation on No Angel is better, but Life for Rent's lyrics are very good, not repetitive and full of sense. Dido's music is far better than Britney's or XTina's or that from other pop stars. Actually, she doesn't need to expose her body to sell her work, even though she's cute and gorgeous. For me, she's one of today's most talented singer/songwriters. I am already waiting for her next material.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I would highly recommend the LET IT BE...NAKED cd to any true Beatles fan.  I find it amusing that many people believe that children today are not aware of the geniousness of the Beatles.  I am twenty years old and have been a huge Beatles fan since a child.  I could not wait to get the new version of the LET IT BE cd.   They are amazing and we will never again witness a group like the Beatles.  <br />Because the LET IT BE cd was remastered, I believe that it is not better, but just different from the original.  There are things that I like about both of the albums, yet I enjoyed the versions of Don't Let Me Down and I've Got A Feeling.  The harmonizing in these songs is just unbelievable.   This CD is simply not a replacment for the original, but an addition.  This cd sounds great because it was stripped of the original orchestrated sound.  It is finally produced as it should have been.  I suggest that it is a great addition to the Beatles collection of cds.
B00005T343|3.0|Ten years past the escape of the psychopathic psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecktor, FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is held accountable for a violent drug-bust that went terribly wrong and is condemned to a desk job. Shortly after this, Lecktor (Anthony Hopkins) turns up in Florance, Italy, much to the delight of a deranged, disfigured vengeance-seeking survivor of his work (Gary Oldman), who had put up a 3 million something dollar reward for his capture. Ironically, the reward for Hannibal's capture comes to the interest of a greedy Italian police inspector (Giancarlo Giannini). Clarice Starling is thrown into the situations when Hannibal establishes contact with her in order to utilize the same type of hypnotic psychological ramblings he utilized while speaking to her from his jail cell. <br />While intriguing and complicated, some may be put off by the overly cumbersome storyline and mostly bland character portrayals. The balance between disturbing violence and actual substance is poorly emphasized. Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Hannibal Lecktor, and while Julianne Moore's characterization of Clarice Starling is weak, it shows an interesting progression of her character in \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\".<br />Overall rating: 3.5 stars.<br />If you like this film, see From Hell.<br />Rated R for some language, savage extreme graphic violence, gore, cannibalism, and sexual overtones.
