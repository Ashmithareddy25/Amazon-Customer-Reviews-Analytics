B007UR1OHO|5.0|Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams are perfect for this lovely story that tugs at the heart. I loved this movie even more because it is based on a true story of a real commitment of love!
B005LAIGQ4|3.0|This movie had a lot of potential, but...just wasn't a home run.<br /><br />The story line was endearing - based loosely on real events.  I have to say that as much as we hoped to enjoy this film we were surprised at the general lack of quality acting from a number of the characters.<br /><br />I think that my favorite characters were the guys from MN who flew to AK to try to help out.  At the same time I was generally disappointed by Danson and Barrymore's efforts, and the young woman newscaster was appropriately annoying.  I hesitate to be too critical, but my family and I agreed that we were happy that we waited to watch this film on DVD rather than paying to see it in a theater.  And, having seen the movie, we all agreed that once was enough.  That's from my wife and I and our 13 and 21 yr old daughters.<br /><br />The special effects used to show the whales were adequate and did not distract.<br /><br />All in all, 3 stars is all I can manage for this film.
1612130585|1.0|After multiple friends asked me if I had read this book, I caved and finally bought the trilogy.<br /><br />What a poorly written pile of crap. I'm disappointed I wasted my money on this. I should have bought a bunch of cheap wine. I'd get the same headache and would have saved myself a lot of time.
B005LAII0I|2.0|With this film and \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" 2012 must be the year for Snow White.<br /><br />Anyway, I was looking forward to seeing this film, as well as \\"...the Huntsman\\".  I knew this would be a much lighter offering, but the makers of the flim, IMO, never really nailed down whether this film was for kids or grownups, and as a result had a confusing mixture of both that was not at all satisfying.<br /><br />Roberts plays a frustrated but not quite wicked enough queen who seems to get her thrills seeing this film's version of Prince Charming standing there shirtless...multiple times.  Snow White, though innocent, comes across mainly as bland, and I'm sorry, but the dwarves on stilts thing just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />All in all this movie was a disappointment, and I'm glad I waited to see this movie on DVD.<br /><br />FYI - My 13-yr old daughter and I watched it, and she said it was basically confusing and that it was not all that great.<br /><br />All I can manage is 2 stars.  I just didn't like it.  Sorry.

I'm disappointed I wasted my money on this. I should have bought a bunch of cheap wine. I'd get the same headache and would have saved myself a lot of time.<br /><br />I don't know why people think this is good. The lead character, Anastasia Steele is a weak, blubbering idiot. Can't we have an adult novel with a strong female character? Seriously. Christian Grey is an ass. And apparently because he rocks her world in bed, can continue to be an ass and it's ok.<br /><br />I sincerely hope women out there do not think this is how relationships should be.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was great. I am definitely left wanting more. Also love that you get Christian Grey's point of view. I hope that the next book is not far behind.

B0011UBDTK|1.0|I got the CDs with a little delay. Some of the CDs play well, others skip, and some episodes cannot be viewed. I am on the 3rd series and I did not watch all episodes. Hope going further I will be able to watch them. So far quality is 50/50.

B008764ZQ4|5.0|Great music- I'm still stunned by Tom Cruise's singing ability. Russell Brand is fantastic and even Alec Baldwin wasn't half bad either. Favorite is \\"More Than Words/Heaven\\"
0061743526|5.0|As a mother who screens everything her 13-year-old daughter reads, I've shared with said daughter many, many newspaper articles that involve stories of persecution and discrimination based on everything under the sun: too light, too dark; tattoos, no tattoos; blond hair, ginger hair; short hair, Mohawk hair; too tall, too short; too fat, too thin - who really knows why people like or dislike someone on sight or through rumour?<br /><br />Of course, it is what they choose to do with their feelings that concerns most \\"normal\\" people - but there is no reading material, no newspaper article that conveys the harm a mob mentality can do as adequately as a good book. Todd Strasser's \\"The Wave\\" (previously reviewed) and Lee Harper's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" are two titles I cannot recommend enough to help generate discussion.<br /><br />For kids growing up in the 21st century, the 1930s and even 1960s are much, much further away than they were when we were growing up. What's changed since then, as far as blind prejudice and \\"following the crowd\\"? Sadly, (here's where the newspaper articles come in) very little. Apparently, people just don't learn.<br /><br />So, with this 50th Anniversary edition of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", I request the book to be released on Kindle as well (\\"The Wave\\" will only be available on Kindle in January 2013.) - and as soon as possible. Will more people read this classic because it's available on Kindle? Maybe if they think no one will see them reading it and judge them for it, they will. Said daughter's review follows:<br /><br />\\" 'To Kill A Mockingbird' by Harper Lee is one of the best classics I have ever read - and I am proud to say that I have read quite a few.<br /><br />\\"The book begins when Scout Finch, aged six, and her old brother, Jem, aged ten, are playing in the summer of 1930. They live in the old, weary town of Maycomb, in Alabama, with the usual sorts of people who live in old, weary towns: the gossips, the religious folk, the oldladies who will bake you cakes and the old ladies who will yell at you whenever they see you - and then they have people like Scout and Jem's father, Atticus, and people like the Ewells.<br /><br />\\"Atticus, is a lawyer, and in Scout's (and my) opinion, the best one in the whole of Alabama.<br /><br />\\"The Ewells, on the other hand, are as bad as pigs in mud - the father drinks, the kids only turn up for three days of schooling during their whole entire lives, and they all cuss as bad as sailors.<br /><br />\\"But, for now, none of that really matters to Scout and Jem. They have other things, *important* things to worry about. Like their mysterious neighbor, and making sure the other kids know their place, and how their crazy old aunt wants to turn Scout into a lady.<br /><br />\\"Then, one day, one of the Ewells, nineteen-year-old Mayella, claims that a black man raped her - and Atticus is chosen to be the man's defendant.<br /><br />\\"Soon, Maycomb, Alabama, is in chaos - the man *is* innocent, everyone knows that, but with people being, well, *people*, sometimes the unfairness of life just has to get a little more unfair.<br /><br />\\"Even if it means the killing of an innocent man.<br /><br />\\"When I first saw this book in my local bookstore, I must have been about the same age as Scout, and I thought that people must be crazy to write a whole book about a *bird*. Now, reading it at the age Jem is at the end of the book, I realize, of course, that the book isn't about a mockingbird.<br /><br />\\"Yet, in a way, it is.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes birds get shot to set food on the table, or for fun, and sometimes men get convicted and shot to keep the peace, and to mollify another man's hurt pride. And either way, the result is the same: the unfair, unjust loss of life.<br /><br />\\"Of course, you argue, humans beings have *evolved*. We fought the Civil War, and World War 2, and all those other wars. Everyone is now as equal as they can possibly be, and everything's all good. But is it? Have we *really* changed at all? Do we stiffen when we see someone of a different race come walking towards us? When we read articles in the news, do we immediately think the person in the pictures is the bad person, convicted before his trial?<br /><br />\\"And almost everyday, I see in newspapers stories - stories about people being killed or wounded because of their skin tone.<br /><br />\\"Their race.<br /><br />\\"Their religion.<br /><br />\\"Because they are gay or lesbian, or like to wear skirts or clown outfits when it isn't Halloween.<br /><br />\\"Because they don't fit our idea of *normal*.<br /><br />\\"So you know what?<br /><br />\\"I believe that every single person on Planet Earth should read this book. They should *all* read this book and *think*.<br /><br />\\"And then, maybe we will all finally be truly equal.\\"

B0067R0APK|1.0|i experienced the force close issues, freezing and crashing my phone that others have. I emailed the developer with a detailed description of the problems along with what phone I have (Samsung Stratosphere). I received a fast response which addressed NONE of the issues. RyanL, their rep, said that the app is not supported for Ice Cream Sandwich devices. (My phone is Gingerbread)<br />I have never gotten such a brusque and unconcerned response from any Android developer. The few apps I ever had problems with, developers have either fixed the problem or offered a refund. This developer couldn't care less about their paying customers.<br />It's unfortunate since the app is attractive and has a nice GUI -when it works.
B000003CMC|5.0|The most wonderful CD ever!  A classic.  Vendor shipped fast; very reliable
B001QXCYZY|4.0|Pretty good setup. Good quality micraphone, also came with disc loaded with manuals and free program instalation for recording/podcast software. Only concern I had was a very minor amount of noise I picked up when recording but I personally am taking care of that by minamizing sound in background and building a sound barrier for the mic.

B003F9RHTA|5.0|Yes, this show is vastly different than the storylines portrayed in SG-1 and in Atlantis. It's the focus that has changed. You still have a stargate, advanced tech, and unbelievable new worlds but this show is about the complexities of humanity and the ways that stress and heroism affect it. I wasn't expecting much, but this show completely surpassed my expectations.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Now I have the complete DVD collection of the Harry Potter story.  Sorry to see that the series is over.  The DVD arrived in a timely fashion and was in perfect condition.  Disappointed with the ending with the main characters assimilating into the Muggle world. The transition from schoolboy to adult parrent was not a smooth reach for the actors.
B00785P2QC|4.0|fast paced easy money making game that resembles real city life. options to make yore city how you want it are unlimited!!
B0087YYHZU|5.0|What a joy to watch the remastered \\"Singin in the Rain\\"!  Though presented in its original 1:37 aspect ratio (this film predates widescreen motion pictures by a couple of years) you soon forget that \\"negative\\" and sit back to enjoy the incredibly singing, dancing, and dialog (favorite lines:  \\"Dignity, always dignity\\";  \\"Sheesh....what am I, dumb or something?\\"; and \\"Well, of course I can talk!\\").<br /><br />Only when watching the added feature-ette (which does *not* include remastered clips from the film) can you have a true appreciation for the clarity and depth of color and definition in the Blu-ray edition.<br /><br />Donald O'Connor's \\"Make 'em Laugh\\" is a tour de force, but what has always been startling to me is to the watch the side-by-side dancing of O'Connor and Gene Kelly (especially in the \\"Moses Supposes\\" number).  O'Connor was great -- no question.  Kelly -- well, of just a completely different (and higher) order.  He is the embodiment of the phrase \\"making it look easy.\\"  And his singing wasn't half bad, either.<br /><br />Just an outstanding film in a gorgeous remastering -- until you see it in Blu-ray, you haven't seen \\"Singin in the Rain.\\"

B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl, (kindle book) had an interesting plot, but it had so many F... words in it that I felt uncomfortable reading it and it pretty much spoiled the book for me.  Some can be expected in recent books, but that was so superfluous it added nothing and detracted from the writing. The twists in the plot is what kept me reading.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I read the Olympian series and The Lost Hero. I am reading The Son Of Neptune. I`m sad that my favorite characters haven`t appeared or appeared much. I heard about the cliffhanger from a friend and am truly disappointed. I have high hopes for Mark of Athena. I don`t like Jason, Piper, Hazel. My favorite demigods are NICO DE ANGELO, CHARLES BECKENDROF, and LUKE CASTELLAN.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|great TV show but Amazon states something strange here about the Bluray product: it is one disc. Either this is a mistake or the sign of something unfortunate since all sites OTHER than Amazon list the Bluray as having 3 discs.
0316098329|2.0|I can't seem to wrap my head around all the good reviews for this book. I found it quite boring. The five year old was, sort of, annoying. I disliked the way he spoke. I found it to be more of a {boring} journal of a five year old: \\"I pooped. I played checkers with ma. I went to bed\\". The first 99 pages were dreadful. If I hadn't of bought the book, I definitely would not have finished it. I skimmed quite a lot just hoping it would end already. I wish there was more. It could have been great. But it fell completely flat for me.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It is amazing what they can do with cartoons there days. I love watching them. The music totally kicked ass!
0143034901|4.0|When you thought you knew what was happening, the author made more twists and turns that would keep you guessing and wanting you to read more. There are so many colorful characters and so much drama, love, suspense, hatred, action, and mystery!<br />I think, at times, it seemed a bit long. And in the beginning I had a bit of trouble getting in to it. But when I did, I couldn't put it down!
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I've been a Testament fan since The Legacy.<br />After releasing five stunning albums both lead guitarist Alex Skolnick and drummer Louie Clemente jumped ship.<br />Multiple lineup changes and three more albums under their belts we find the original guitarist rejoining on the last album.<br />So now that the new lineup has had some time to settle how does the new album stand up?<br />Well, it's not Formation, it's definitely more like classic Testament.<br />If you liked the first five albums then you'll like this one.<br />Superb production.<br />Killer drumming.<br />Brilliant lead work from Eric and Alex.<br />The bass is actually audible and is excellent.<br />Chuck Billy turns in one of his most powerful performances to date.<br />If you're looking for another Demonic then you might want to preview this one first.<br />Classic Testament the whole way.<br />No weak tracks and some killer bonus tracks as well.<br />A dream come true for an old school fan.<br />Recommended.
1451629192|4.0|She is so brave for writing her story for all of us to \\"see\\". So sad and yet so hopeful. This is a \\"short\\" diary of her last 20 years. I am not sure how the mind and body can live through that many years of abuse and rebound back into society. She is so courageous. I believe in 10 years or so we'll hear the side of their story from her children's perspective.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all 3 of the 50 shades in 2 weeks while traveling this summer.  It is a hard book to put down once your start.  left me wanting to read more.
0525423656|3.0|3.5. Better than book one, (because more detail is given) but seems like book two is a \\"filler\\" so we can find out what happens in book three. Does there always have to be a trilogy?? These 2 people that are so in love seem not as in love as they find each other again? They give everything up for one another and then it just seems to fizzle?...after all the hype/\\"romance\\" in book one? The writer seems to take turns too quickly instead of easing you into a transition. And why the heck isn't Cassie's family mentioned the whole time? I will read book 3 just so I can finish it. The author just isn't a great story teller and there never really is any depth. She doesn't know how to develop characters.
1405853115|4.0|This book is a really good reference for English teachers! It is easy for reading and is quite practicle even for a new starter like me. Also, with the DVD, I am able to have a general idea about what the on-site teaching experience could be!

Oh GOD, no).<br /><br />I got up to the following:<br /><br />\\"Damn my hair--it just won't behave, and damn Katherine Kavanagh for being ill and subjecting me to this ordeal.\\"<br /><br />That was really about all I could handle.<br /><br />An interesting observation about the reviews posted: A great many of the NEGATIVE reviews are well-written and contain proper grammar and spelling while most of the the POSIIVE reviews...well...don't.<br /><br />My favorite one has been \\"I hate to read and I read all three in one week!\\"<br /><br />Oh, AMERICA...
B005LAIHY0|3.0|This is amazon.com. We enter here to BUY PRODUCTS, and user reviews are supposed to review the product, which, in this case, is the bluray.

Go to IMDB to review the movie and leave this useful for purchasers!!!
B003IMMEKG|5.0|The movie in general is super. Arnold at his best. The rest of the cast is a bit wooden but that is to be expected.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|Its too bad when an author with a gift for writing does not use it for the betterment of human kind.  This book had explicit, dirty sexual material and frequent use of the f*** word.  I did not finish the book.
B002VPE1X4|3.0|I genreally love AmazonBasics products but I regret buying this case. Although it provides adequate protection, it's just not a very efficient case. The main area for the camera feels somewhat snug but the front pocket, the top flap, and the sides are loose fitting and it makes the case feel really unnecessarily big.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll find a use for this someday (providing protection in a suitcase?) but I won't be using this as a carry-around case.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I liked that it was a true story.  After I read this book I saw the author on Oprah. I loved that show.

B007L96VCY|5.0|I listened to my VINYL RAM 3 days ago just to prepare for the DIFFERENCE coming my way....<br /><br />I must say, as many times as I've listened to this PERFECTLY imperfect LP (41, 56, 73, 109 times?), it still sounds warm and rich and fun and weird and fractious.  And not a skip or pop or scratch heard.  I think this was the Beatle angels looking out for me.  Also my personal style/care in not scavenging my vinyl by subjecting them to fingerprints and parties, always holding them by the edge as instructed! I do recall buying this gorgeously arty yellow and multi-colored seventies gatefold LP at Music Plus in Hermosa Beach, CA on PCH and 8th , with no other purchases that day, because somehow I sensed it was a \\"special\\" record.  It has remained so.<br /><br />Early on in my listening days with this lovable LP, the hit \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" with its multiple song part structures, was my natural favorite (the hit song usually is!)  Through the years, different songs \\"hit me\\" between the ears at different times for different reasons.  LP filler like \\"Three Legs\\": simply cute and playful, with some nonsense (?) allusions I never could quite unravel.  \\"Smile Away\\" the nastiest,  ballsiest,  in your face (literally)--- rocker that burns down to end side one, with the killer line... \\"Man I could smell your teeth a mile away!\\".  \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\": for its weirdly outrageous lyrics: \\"I stood in the attic, a Piano up my nose, and the wind played a dreadful cantata\\", and off the charts singing as well as humorously phrased Ad Libs (a McCartney perfected style with no equal---think of Hey Jude fade out) with those \\"boldly outspoken piano\\" sounds and unique characters (Billy Budapests?) funkyness being damned.  Other times it may have been the charming mellowness of \\"Heart of The Country\\", or the lusty feel and great guitar riff of \\"Eat at Home\\".  Still other times, the not so tender jabs at Yoko and her ilk in the supreme LP opener \\"Too Many People\\" or jabbing more tenderly at Lennon, his \\"ex\\" in the bittersweet and poignantly plaintive \\"Dear Boy\\".  The charm and loveliness of \\"Long Haired Lady\\" also enraptured me.  What love he had for his still \\"newlywed\\" Linda!!!  The melodic simplicity of \\"top grade filler\\" like \\"Ram On\\" and it's reprise put a touch of lightness into the whole affair.  But the song that really hit me the other day, and it has in the past as well; the OTHER epic \\"masterpiece\\" on this record, is \\"Back Seat Of My Car\\".  What a glorious sendoff LP closer it is, with its string orchestrations and outright tunefulness and storyline pleading for understanding to his lovers father for a, at the time, moralistic love/sex freedom, so achingly sung by Macca...it's powerfully DRIVEN chorus just leaves you spent, which it seems was the intention.  The song was,  I read somewhere,  a failed attempt single (?) or something, but nothing about this record feels failed...it is Paul and Linda's true masterpiece.re tenderly at Lennon, his \\"ex\\" in the bittersweet and poignantly plaintive \\"Dear Boy\\".

0425263908|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the trilogy of Fifty Shades of Grey, so when I saw this was a smiliar read, I was excited to dig in. I did take some time to read reviews here, and despite some of the negatives I saw, I chose to go ahead and purchase this for my Kindle. Wow, I am so glad I did! I loved the writing style, the character development, and of course all of the steamy sex involved. This book does not delve into BDSM like FSOG did, and given the intensity between Gideon and Eva, it worked very well here. I just wish the next book was available already!
B006CR2PD0|5.0|Haven't seen this movie in ten plus years and have been waiting for it to be released on DVD and/or blu-ray. It is just as hot as ten years ago! The on screen chemistry is great and I only wish Mickey Rourke looked like he did back then!
B003B02PF4|4.0|John Grisham's legal thrillers come out of a certain mould, and follows a formula. A formula that's been proven to draw readers like me. While this is good in a way that it makes the sales, it is not so by way of reviewing his work - sometimes I am not left with anything to say anymore. They're all the same....there's always a circumstance, a twist, and most of the time the \\"hero\\" saves his life at the end.<br /><br />This applies to \\"The Broker\\". I almost did not want to part with it, contemplating even to read it while waiting inside the church before the mass started (I thought better and dismissed this bad idea). Looking beyond the formulaic plot, I'm glad that it all worked out in the end - not that Backman's life was spared, but that he made realizations of the things in life that are more important than making big money and being at the top. If the reader can gleam this, then Grisham can still stick to his formula.
030758836X|4.0|Okay I thought this was definitely going to be five stars....but the ending made me make it only 4. I loved the way the author told the story, rotating points of view every other chapter. The book had surprise after surprise, and made me just want to read, read, read! I plan on reading more of Flynn`s books. A great read but wanted more at the end!

B000HL0KHA|5.0|Archer's morality is tested and the choice between right and wrong become insignificant. This is the kind of Star Trek I like to see; when real decisions have to be made that aren't mandated by a simple Star Fleet protocol. These past two episodes have been amazing, and in some ways they have been better than most all Star Trek episodes out of all the series.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|abosultely one of my favorite albums by vedder- amazingly well done. all the songs are incredible! not to mention its the soundtrack to one of my most fav. movie and book of all time, into the wild. i highly suggest this to any pearl jam or vedder fan.
B000HL2H3A|5.0|This season has shown so much promise and it's delivered on so many levels. This episode (and the next) represent the essence of this series; the special effects, the inter-species diplomacy, drama, action....it's all here in fine form.<br /><br />TNG will still always hold a special place in my heart, and that has nothing to do with nostalgia (since I just saw it for the first time a year ago). But, Enterprise conjures up a whole 'nother level of excitement for me. The same kind of joy that Battle Star Galactia or FireFly made me feel....It's real and gritty and it's not all about nonsense techno-babble. T'Pol has finally become something more than a cardboard cut-out, she's been the only thing holding back my love for this series. Glad to see everything coming together, and I can confirm the love for this series is justified.
B008BM9L72|5.0|What a great read. This book can be looked at in so many ways. Its pure sex, love story and money. But mostly I feel it is about relationships and that we are not all the same and anything can be achieved if we communicate!

B004LROUNG|4.0|It's been years since I've read one of Grisham's novels-- he never disappoints. The characters in The Litigators are very rich, and the sub-plots add depth to the interesting storyline, the ongoing saga of Big Pharmacy vs. Everyone In The World. The book wrapped up neatly with a satisfying ending and epilogue  [perhaps its just coincidence, but It seems every novel I've read this year ended abruptly or with a lack of resolution]. Altogether a great read.

B002LATN9G|5.0|Never thought a movie about bare knuckle fighting would hold my attention, but it did. The casting I felt was very well done. Everyone was very believable in their roll, even those individuals I was unfamiliar with. I found myself actually caring about these characters, and could very easily identify with their struggles to make a living...doing what you have to, but may not really want to in a city that thrives on money. I grew up in New York and receognized many of the street scenes that are so typical of the city. The Bronx scenes were a flash back to my childhood. Raw and hard core, you have to live there to understand the mind set of the inhabitants. This movie captured the culture and the sub-culture of hustling. I enjoyed this movie very much!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This has been fixed.<br /><br />I have not had a chance to read this.  The format the kindle book loaded skips parts of sentences when it goes from page-to-page.  I've changed the font size numerous times and I've deleted and re-loaded 3 different times.  No change.

B006LSZECO|4.0|[[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel] Bought this for a good summer read. The book does not disappoint. It kept my interest to the unexpected last chapter.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|I only rate this movie with one star, because zero is not available.  The first movie was great for this type of genre, however this sequel was a waste of time and money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Everywhere I turned, I found people reading this book... at the hair salon... in Business Class at 32,000 feet, at the beach...  Now I know why.  I read the entire set of three books in less than two weeks.  Please let there be more!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|It is very rare to find a movie that can keep up with the book and as amazing as the film version of \\"The Godfather\\" was it still isn't as good as the book. This book shows the sweeping landscape of New York's dark side and exposes the general public to La Cosa Nostra. I just absolutely loved this book and am so thankful that Puzo gave us such immortal characters as Vito Corleone, Michael Corleone, Tom Hagen, and even Santino to some regard. Can anyone ever get the image of Khartoum's decapitated head in Woltz's bed out of their head?<br /><br />Some people think this book is boring and don't care about the secondary characters. They are being foolish. Johnny Fontane shows us a different side of Vito Corleone. Carlo is a villain and he returns later in the book. So much of this book is about building depth and it is completely character driven. If people are expecting three hours of intrigue from a lengthy novel then they just have unrealistic expectations or don't want to invest the time to think.
0345803493|5.0|I love the romance of this book without the need to oversexualize.  Great characters and a good story line.  Thank James for this intriguing series.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I was drawn to this film the first time I saw the preview at the theater almost a year before it was released, the wait was worth it. The preview did not remind me of previous \\"Alien(s) films\\" so I was not expecting any prequel, sequel, or any other such nonsense. I thought I was going to see a futuristic sci fi film with some amazing scenes, I was totally blown away! This is a truly modern sci fi masterpiece, visually stunning, thought provoking, terrifying...amazing.<br />Ridley Scott delivers, exceeds expectations, by creating a new view on an old premise that maybe we are not alone or maybe, just maybe we were deposited here by other beings. And if that is true, what can create can also destroy just as easily.<br />We see our own advances into the future and are inspired and amazed, then we see what may have created us and find out that they are advanced beyond our biggest dreams and we are nothing but a failed experiment. The beings may be advanced and powerful, but our passion for life, and knowledge is a threat to them and they decide to trigger our destruction because of it.
0439023491|5.0|Wonderful series for all ages.  I would recommend this series to just about anyone.  Strong characters with a great story line.  Thank you Suzanne Collins for such a wonderful read!

B003ZUTVJS|5.0|My Niece needed this movie and could not find it so I looked it up on Amazon and yup there it was and she rented it for $3.00 what a deal and this helped her pass the college exam that she was taking.<br />Being a student and a mother of 2  teenagers this cost was just right for her.<br />I also watched this movie and was extremely touched and learned much about autism.
B005GSY23M|5.0|A real hero, a real human being. Cliche to just state that, but it's absolutely the best way to tell you how much this movie resonated with me. Call me a fanboy, whatever--but this is a hero I can believe in. Slaying dragons is violent too, right? So here we have a modern (super-modern) white knight tale with all the hallmarks of a great movie. I wouldn't call it a film, not because it's not good enough, but because it takes pulp and pop and makes them serve a higher calling. Super-revved, super-dramatic, super-great! Incredible execution, blasting pop music, and pink letters burned into the LA night skyline. And this is the music that helps define it.<br /><br />Driver, live forever.

Hope the movies screen writers do a better job w the screenplay/script than the writer did.. but it sure is popular! so kudos for her. Im not GLUED to it like i am with most books, but it is good.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|As you know this is a great flick for not only children but for adults too. As an animator myself, I can actually sit and enjoy this movie unlike others. We it bought for our little one because it's great comedy and doesn't get old after being played over and over again. Parents, I know you know what I am talking about, LoL.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was hesitant to read these books, however, once I started, I couldn't put them down!  I was staying up literally all night on the weekend and really, really late (or early) during the week, just to finish and start the next one.  I have read all 3 twice.  I've picked up a few other books to read since, but I keep thinking about those books!  Yes, I'll end up reading them a third and fourth time.<br /><br />Everyone complains about the writing of these books, however, realize they are for ENTERTAINMENT not Pulitzer prizes! Do not take these books and yourself too seriously when reading!  Just sit back, enjoy and let your mind wander!!!!<br /><br />I wish there could be more 50 shades books, I would scoop them up in a minute!~  Cannot wait to see who plays Christian and Anastasia in the movie! ENJOY!

B003INJETO|1.0|Only the most diehard crazy Pain of Salvation fan can defend this album. It is terrible.<br /><br />The problem with this album is not that it is \\"different\\", or that there is \\"no metal\\" in it, or anything like that. (In many ways, it's not really _that_ different.) The problem is simply that it is unbelievably boring.<br /><br />Some have said that many of the best PoS songs are simple, as if to vindicate _Road Salt Part One_. That is a true statement, sure. But an important point is lost if one fails to realize that most simple PoS songs are actually good. They are not boring. _Road Salt Part One_ features songs that are simple and boring. Or complex and boring. They are all boring.<br /><br />Others have said, \\"Well, people aren't giving it a fair chance because it's called Pain of Salvation. BUT, if it had a different name, people would judge it on its own merits and like it.\\" Um... No. If any band released this album it would be garbage.<br /><br />A boring album is the last thing you'd expect from PoS, because they are genuinely NOT a boring band. They are usually exciting, full of surprises, and good, interesting writing.<br /><br />\\"No Way\\" is the most dull Pain of Salvation opener in the universe. Why anyone thought it was appropriate to open an album with this tranquillizer song I will never understand. The middle section when Gildenlow is singing in a weird time signature sounds so bad. Really though you'll be lucky to fall asleep before this overlong, overwrought grandpa rock gets to the next song because it gets worse. \\"She Likes to Hide\\" is slow sleazy song of bluesy boredom, it would be \\"super boring\\" rather than \\"boring\\" but fortunately it is over in less than 3 minutes. \\"Sisters\\" is some kind of weird ballad and it's very long and boring. \\"Of Dust\\" will put you to sleep if you are still awake by this point, although you will experience a moment of uncomfortable laughter when the spoken word part kicks in, because you will think, \\"LOL this is so stupid, what was D/Gildenlow thinking???\\" \\"Tell Me You Don't Know\\" will be skipped every time because you are so embarrassed on Gildenlow's behalf. \\"Sleeping under the Stars\\" sounds a Tom Waits song with all the Awesome(TM) removed. \\"Darkness of Mine\\" is hilariously over-the-top and laughable. \\"Linoleum\\" sounds like extremely drunk Foo Fighters. I'm not even going to finish talking about these songs. This album sucks. The last four songs are all bad. Actually, I will mention \\"Innocence\\", the finale, because at times it ALMOST seems like it COULD HAVE BEEN good.<br /><br />Disclosure: _Entropia_ is my favorite. The first four PoS albums are brilliant. _BE_ was mostly great with some terrible moments. I really liked _Scarsick_ a lot.id, what was D/Gildenlow thinking???\\" \\"Tell Me You Don't Know\\" will be skipped every time because you are so embarrassed on Gildenlow's behalf. \\"Sleeping under the Stars\\" sounds a Tom Waits song with all the Awesome(TM) removed. \\"Darkness of Mine\\" is hilariously over-the-top and laughable. \\"Linoleum\\" sounds like extremely drunk Foo Fighters.

0393080269|4.0|The author of this book, Ruchir Sharma, is head of Emerging Market investment at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. He is a regular contributor to the Wall Street Journal and the Economic Times. He spends a week per month in a developing country somewhere on the globe 'kicking its tyres' to get a feel for what is really going on with the economy. This is a man who can be assumed to know his stuff - his essential 'stuff' being: 'is this particular economy likely to flourish and should you consider investing in it?'<br /><br />I am, sadly, not personally seeking an investment home for a few billions of spare cash, but I read the book out of a growing curiosity about what the global economy may come to look like in the relatively near future: about the real likelihood of a decline of the West and the apparently inexorable rise of China and other emerging economies. This book gave me everything I wanted, and more.<br /><br />Sharma's key point is that it is no longer useful or sensible to talk about 'emerging markets' as one investment opportunity: these markets make up nearly 40% of the global economy and about 15% of the value of the world's stock markets and there are highly significant differences between individual economies. Here's the basic plot: a 'breakout nation' (the ones investors might be especially interested in) is one that can exceed, or at least match, the growth rate for its income class. To get a rounded view of individual markets, Sharma monitors per capita income (so much more revealing than GDP), but also some more idiosyncratic measures, such as the cost of a cocktail or a hotel room (the high relative cost of cocktails and hotel rooms in Brazil, Russia and South Africa suggests that their currency is over-valued, affecting their future competitiveness)and whether local businesses  are investing their money at home or overseas (perhaps not a measure of  impressive global ambitions, but rather a reflection of mistrust of the economic situation at home).<br /><br />Sharma's focus on per capita income is especially revealing. For the relatively small economy of the Czech Republic, for example, which has a relatively high $20,000 per capita income, 'breaking out' would require a potentially achievable growth of around 3 to 4 percent. For China, currently still in the region of $5,000 per capita average income, 'anything less than 6 to 7 percent [growth] will feel like a recession.'  Sharma drives home the point in his chapter dedicated to the current Chinese economy and its immediate prospects: 'In 1998, for China to grow its $1 trillion economy by 10 percent, it had to expand its economic activities by $100 billion and consume only 10 percent of the world's industrial commodities - the raw materials that include everything from oil to copper to steel. In 2011, to grow its $6 trillion economy that fast, it needed to expand by $600 billion a year and suck in more than 30 percent of global commodity production.' It's a simple point: it much easier to grow fast from a smaller base. Now China`s workforce is becoming more expensive: more middle class and more middle aged, as the country's population growth begins to decline. This leads to one of Sharma's key conclusions (key, that is, if you are a bit over-obsessed with China, as most of us are): growth in the Chinese economy will inevitably slow down,believes Sharma, to maybe 6 or 7 percent. This will not, clearly, be disastrous for China (despite the fact that this may feel like going backwards to the Chinese themselves) and it may calm fears about China's role in the world:  Sharma records that a 2011 Gallup poll recorded that 52% of Americans thought that China was the world's leading economy, while only 32% of thought that America's was. America is, in fact, the world's leading economy: China's economy is one third of the size, and average income is one tenth of America's.  Concerns about America's economic future, says Sharma, may well be 'over-wrought'.<br/><br />China is, of course, only one chapter in the book's analysis of world markets. Sharma focuses his microscope on every significant 'emerging' nation. India? Perhaps over-reliant on the 'demographic dividend'; large numbers of working-age people are only an advantage if they can be put to productive work, and India's population has yet to emulate the Chinese model, where higher proportions of the population have moved from the countryside to more productive and higher-paying jobs in urban areas. Brazil? Not enough investment in infrastructure (roads and factories), too dependent on exporting commodities; too quick to develop a welfare state. Mexico? An oligopoly, where state monopolies were sold off and immediately turned into private monopolies. Russia?  'An oil state that has lost its way' - a bit of a mixture of Brazil and Mexico. South Africa? Sill living on the 'peace dividend': the nation's gratefulness for the end to apartheid and the avoidance of what could easily have become civil war. Sri Lanka? Well-placed to benefit seriously from the real 'peace dividend' resulting from the end of their own civil conflict. South Korea? 'The gold medallist': adaptive; innovative; focussed on high-value manufacturing; prepared to undergo brief periods of 'creative destruction' when changing economic circumstances reveal structural weaknesses. An object lesson to us all, in fact.<br /><br />Two fundamental points that Sharma makes resonated particularly with me. The first is that the West as become too concerned with 'soft landings' and that bringing these about by means of government-sponsored economic measures tends merely to prolong economic agony, whereas  short sharp shocks (the South Korean way) can be invigorating. The second is that free-market democracies are not the only route to economic success and that several command economies have been remarkably successful. The secret, however, he suggests, lies in the dynamism and vision of key leaders (for example, China's arguably pivotal reformer, the late Deng Xiaoping).<br /><br />There is even an uplifting conclusion to the book. China's current insatiable appetite for resources (oil, metals etc) will soon tail off - and anyway, as Sharma reminds us, China is mainly using resources that would have been used elsewhere, before so much manufacturing moved to China. Sharma believes that current pessimistic fears about the exhaustion of the world's resources is over-blown and that a 'commodity.com' bubble can be clearly seen in the fact that the daily volume of trades in energy futures (speculative bets on the future price of energy) is twenty-two times higher than the daily global demand for energy: our fears about future resources are driving a fever of speculative activity that will surely end in a commodities price crash. This will be good news for many of us - but not, for example, for commodity-based economies such as Russia and Brazil. In the meantime, as more and more economies become slowly wealthier, we will all have more neighbours to sell things to.<br /><br />Please do not imagine that I have been able even to mention every interesting fact and idea covered in this book. It's a bit of dense read; one can sense its origins as a collection of 'special reports' for the Wall Street Journal etc, but it has been well transformed into a good read, with interesting bits of colour from Sharma's obviously jet-setting lifestyle. I had a mild (well, severe) attack of status anxiety when Sharma recounts that, when he was reluctant to fly to the previously Tamil rebel region of Sri Lanka in the only-available single-engine helicopter (a model with a bit of a reputation for crashing) his 'accommodating hosts arranged for the air force to take me up in a twin-engine helicopter.' Remind me to try that trick if I ever holiday, tourist class, in Sri Lanka, as I hope to. I guess if Mr Sharma likes what he sees in a country, that could be rather more significant in terms of future inward investment than if the Gifford family takes a fancy to a place.<br /><br />I have one very minor gripe: the book's few photographs are slightly randomly positioned in the text, leading to sudden geographic confusion. Thus a photograph of Manila crops up in a section on Indonesia; the section of the Philippines comes several pages later. The index confirms that a photograph of Nigeria's burgeoning film industry, `Nollywood' is on page 186, whereas the reference in the text comes full 25 pages later. Maybe it's my newspaper and magazine background: I like my pictures to illustrate the text I am reading. But I am being pedantic.<br /><br />In the meantime, having small-mindedly moaned about some interesting photographs and failed utterly to list every interesting area covered in this book, I'm off to read it all over again.China's arguably pivotal reformer, the late Deng Xiaoping).<br /><br />There is even an uplifting conclusion to the book.

0307716546|3.0|I ordered this book as soon as it was published, based on starred reviews.  I have tried to like it, I have, but as they say on the other side of the pond, I've lost the plot.  First of all, I'm not too fond of the way it's narrated...as the author is otherwise engaged (not to give too much away).  It makes the narrator, in my opinion, somewhat unreliable.  Furthermore, there is too much backstory and meandering side themes.  I have picked this book up countless times since I brought it home, only to put it back down in favor of a more engrossing title.  I really enjoyed the author's \\"Sister\\".  This one, not so much.  I am trying to finish it just to see \\"who dun it\\", but may have to skip through (more than I have) to get to the end.

0062206281|4.0|THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN re-introduces us to Daniel Sempere who runs a bookstore in Barcelona with his ailing father. But the main character in this sequel to both THE SHADOW OF THE WIND and THE ANGEL'S GAME is their oddball assistant Fermin who spent a few of the early Franco-era years in the city's medieval Montjuic prison. A fellow prisoner was the impoverished potboiler writer David Martin, falsely convicted because the venal prison governor wanted a captive literary 'ghost'. Fermin resolves to escape and seek vengeance for both himself and David.<br /><br />Zafon always hints honestly at his sources, and references to LES MISERABLES acknowledge that this is, partially, a \\"hommage\\" to Victor Hugo. There is also another nod to GREAT EXPECTATIONS, and some riverside scenes put me in mind of Vincent Price's camp extravaganza THE THEATRE OF BLOOD!<br /><br />The first 50 pages of this keenly awaited new novel suffer from an uneven pace and, for a book set in the 1930s and 50s, there are some jarringly modern words (Zafon's fault or the translator's?). An intermittently humorous tone, together with the plot emphasis on Fermin's impending wedding and David Martin's not-so-secret passion for Daniel Sempere's mother Isabella, nudge the book to the edge of romantic comedy. It's only the prison scenes that are rich in atmosphere and pop a surprise or two.<br /><br />What we expect from Senor Zafon (and Isabel Allende and Salman Rushdie) is Magic Realism. This time Zafon serves up a bit more realism and a lot less magic. From almost any other author THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN would be regarded as a considerable achievement but THE SHADOW OF THE WIND was a magnificent achievement, raising the bar for all authors, including Zafon. In THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN he seems to be \\"treading water\\". It's a good book, but it's not a great book.<br /><br />[Reviewer is the author of SHAIKH-DOWN]
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The pages just seemed to turn themselves. I was captivated by every word; yearning for more of Christian Grey.
B001NLL93W|2.0|I couldn't get through it. I wanted to so bad, and I just got to about 100 and I just stopped. I really love the idea of the plot, it is just, the writing. When a supprise comes, it doesnt build up to it it just says it, wich is pointless.
B005VTGB0S|4.0|I bought this item for my New iPad on one of those lightning deals... perhaps I should have done my homework before checking out. Don't get me wrong, the Case is Leather and it looks great, but if you try to plug a pair of headphones, control the volume or turn it off... you almost need to take it out of the case.<br /><br />It seems that every elastic band is over some button or plug.<br /><br />It's a great item, but you need to know what you're getting.<br /><br />P.S. It lack where to put the little pencil thingy

B0068LYEHA|5.0|You'd think at 63 I'd be more prone to seeing this book as a bit too \\"blunt\\". It was a \\"can't put down\\" from page one. Spot on descriptions and tells it like it REALLY is for women. Bravo!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really fun and really addictive!! everyone ive shown this game to loves it and cant put it down I highly recommend this
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I originally downloaded the free version of this and loved it, so after reading the full version reviews I went ahead and spend a few dollars on the whole thing. Totally worth it! I have never relaxed so quickly and the sounds are so soothing! If you like the free version go the extra step and buy the full one!
0553807919|5.0|I´m still reading the book, but I agree with most of the ideas the author share with us. Sometimes I loose control, but I´m a parent and I must know how to direct my children specially in times they are the one losing control. I applied some techiniques and it does work. Off course we can´t apply all the time, but it´s worth having in my mind. Very good and I recomend.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain is a successful corporate negotiator and an introvert.  She reminds us that one out of every two or three people we know are also introverts and she invites us to understand them.  It's an uphill battle.  We tend to see extroverts as more intelligent, more attractive, more interesting, and more likeable than introverts.  In fact, the outgoing and likeable extrovert has become our cultural ideal.  In our current business culture the two best predictors of success are verbal fluency and sociability.  The deck is stacked against the quiet and more reserved.<br /><br />Cain makes two key points.  First, introverts can do the same things as extroverts--and do them well.  They can lead negotiating teams, facilitate class discussions, and even be so outgoing that others see them as extroverts.  One strategy is to manage time to ensure sufficient opportunities to \\"recharge.\\"  This is important because it requires extra energy for an introvert to take on these roles.  Recent research traces introversion/extroversion to underlying differences in the amount of outside stimulation needed to function well.  Introverts are comfortable with much less going on around them than are extroverts.<br /><br />The second point is that introverts have their own strengths.  They can excel in leadership roles by valuing the ideas and actions of others and by giving them the space to innovate.  Many artists, engineers and inventors get great results from their solitary work styles.  There is time and quiet to work through the implications of new ideas before they are subjected to sudden-death judgment by a team of extroverts.  Cain describes the \\"deliberate practice\\" in which introverts explore the frontiers of their knowledge, experiment with new techniques, and learn from their mistakes without embarrassment.  Such practice is the path to expertise.<br /><br />And there is more.  The author interviews and researches the contributions of several successful introverts.  They range from Steve Wozniak to relative unknowns who very much enjoy their low profiles.  She explores the biological and developmental roots of introversion, distilling recommendations for parents and teachers.  There are recommendations for introverts themselves, too.  Many focus on finding jobs and roles that fit their preferences and deciding how to invest their scarce social energy.  Some recommendations address impulsiveness, rewards, and how to play the stock market.  There is something for everyone.<br /><br />  This book is highly recommended for introverts and anyone who interacts with them.  It will deepen your perspective--even if you are an extrovert--and send you away with one or two new strategies for dealing with life.from Steve Wozniak to relative unknowns who very much enjoy their low profiles.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Reading this book is not even like reading. It is like flying. You put the book down and you feel as if you have woken up from the best moment of your life. No, you dont read this book you live it. I feel wrong even calling it a book. It is a memory, nothing less.<br /><br />  There are places in this life that give you the feeling waitlessness just thinking of them. I feel as if this book is not only my favorite book and best friend but also the best place I can hope to see in this world. Even if I only expirience it in my thoughts and memories.
B007C3TVNA|1.0|I hate movies that insult my intelligence and this is one of those movies. Here is a partial list of what I found too preposterous:<br /><br />a. That this woman would be with this man, give up her lifestyle to become a suburbanite.<br />b. That this woman didn't tell her husband what the son was doing. Like not telling her husband about what she found in the kitchen sink.<br />c. That she never sought professional help for Kevin--or herself.<br />d. That townspeople would treat her the way they did, or that she'd stay in the same town.<br />e. The bows n arrows massacre??? Puh-leeze.<br /><br />The one thing I found positive about the film was the depiction of this woman's repugnance for her baby: if you know anything about infant development, you'll know that a loveless mother can indeed spawn a psychopath like Kevin.
0345803493|1.0|This book sucks.  I loved the first book.  Very easy to get lost in.  This book is horrible.  I couldn't even finish it.  I haven't even started the 3rd because I really don't want to lose anymore time.  Anna is written as though she is an idiot here.  I understand the lack of knowledge with the world she has entered into and even the true inexperience of the basics, however, this is ridiculously written to the extreme.  For me this book sounds like a 14 year old writing about her experience with the high school jock.
0739383280|4.0|Poppy Wyatt was having tea with some friends at a hotel, celebrating her upcoming nuptials, when the fire alarm went off (fire drill). When it was over, her engagement ring was missing and her phone snatched. She finds a phone in the trash can and it becomes her lifeline to the hotel finding her ring. The problem was that the phone belonged to the now absent personal assistant of businessman Sam Roxton and he wants it back. In the meantime, Poppy figures finders, keepers and she's not ready to let this phone go.<br /><br />What happens next is the most hilarious romp as Poppy tries to hide the fact her ring is missing, one that is her fianc&eacute;'s family heirloom, and to help navigate messages received for Sam on her \\"new\\" phone. Her attempts to humanize him in his communication with his subordinates and third parties just wreaked havoc in his life.  She is well meaning and clever but was pretty naive in her meddling. This made for many laugh out loud moments. Poppy's preparations for her own wedding add further complications, especially the tenuous relationship with Magnus' (fianc&eacute;) parents and the wedding planner from hell. There is a serious side, though, as her relationship gets tested and Poppy has to deal with some disappointments about Magnus.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook and the narrator was fantastic, one of the best I've ever heard. She brought the story and characters to life in a way that I don't think I could have by simply reading it in printed form. I highly recommend this format because it was a wonderful reading experience, making this one of my most favorite reads this year.
B003EEMIV8|5.0|the item arrived quickly and excellent state, my son is happy with the toy.  The toy is very educational and work good.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game gets addicting after you get a hang to it. you makes you want to keep going.! and you should try it out.
B005IZLPMY|2.0|I've seen all the spidey movies. The old batman and Christopher Nolan's batman trilogy. Also seen Great super hero anime movies like Hulk vs. and the batman anime movies along with the punisher war zone, thor, Blade's movies, arnold's movies (all of them, action that is), Matrix, Transporter 1 and 2, Michael Jai White action flicks, the list goes on. I'm a big action and i have a very large movie collection. I must say though that this movie just doesn't do it for me. It seemed boring, kind of slow, just didn't have enough/much action in it and what was there was not that big of a deal. Really. My friend likes it and i don't see why. The story is really nothing to get excited about and isn't what you would call captivating. I rate this by far 2.5 out of 5 stars. To be honest, on my first watch i couldn't even finish it it was that weak. Maybe 3 stars, but check out all the other ones first or buy them. They are worth you time and money. Check out my Listmania's

B000JMKQX0|3.0|I don't get the hype around this book. Yes, Zombies. Ok, I get it. But still... I don't. If you are into zombies, you should give this a try. If not, I wouldn't bother. It's ok.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|once I got the free version of the app I was relieved I can fall asleep faster so that night I played a song and 10 minutes later it was like I was in a deep tease and couldn't wake up.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Ok, so the story is interesting. The universe is special. The characters are strong. It's a good read, BUT I will not read the next 2 books. There is a lot of hype around this book, but that's not really saying anything good about it... Still, you should probably read it.
B000089QEN|2.0|A&E strikes again. Buyers beware. Some 25 minutes have been edited out of this mini-series because A&E is lazy and just takes the edited versions they aired on television and burned them to disk. If you have a region free DVD player get the version from the UK that is 25 minutes longer. See below.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.co.uk/Vanity-Fair-DVD/dp/B0009WL8OG/ref=sr_1_2?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1344233716&sr=1-2
B003G4W49C|4.0|That book is good and I will probably read it again someday. The story is good, the writing is good, the \\"universe\\" is good, the caracters are likeable and somewhat realistic. You will want to continue reading, and you will be pleased you did.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|This is an absolutely awesome watch. I like the fact that I will never have to replace a battery for this watch for a very long time.  I do have several other Seiko divers watches.  I like the quality of Seiko watches. I always have had to replace the batteries on these watches every 2 to 3 years.  But as soon as I bought this watch, I realized I will never have to buy a battery again!!!  Seiko watches are the best in the world...IMHO.  This one has become my favorite watch of all time!!! The price and quality are second to none!!

B008AG3PK8|5.0|Great quality and a great show. I did not encounter and issues with the streaming of the video. THank you for making these episodes available.
B000TGXT0S|5.0|Classic Megadeth , benchmark , Marty's solos are added flavor , Mustaine is the riff master . This line up is great all the songs are 5 star , ***** .
B0086DBE62|3.0|Mild humor, costumes and scenery are this show. The ladies are the strong characters, the evil queen, Julia Robert's character, is intelligent. Snow white takes a while to catch on.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I wish I could play it! it will get to analyzing power grid And say it could not play it. does anyone know how to fix it
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I was suprised after reading this book with all the hype and all. There was nothing really that took me by suprise after all this sort of thing has been around since the early days and if you have read anything on early history you would have read or seen it. I found the book in parts very predicable so it was not the book that I just had to take to bed with me and read everynight.
B0088TG252|4.0|Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?<br />Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.<br /> For video reviews<br />Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?<br />How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|like game but wish it didn't cost so much to continue to expand. it's fun trying to catch scrat when he runs across the screen
B006LSZECO|3.0|I finished this book in 2 days. A real page turner & It kept me interested for 3/4 of the book. The last portion of the book was a disappointment. The ending is horrible. Id rather read a mediocre book with a great ending than the other way around. I gave it 3 stars but I'm not sure I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very fun and addictive. I think I like it more than angry birds. I cant wait for more to be released.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book because of all the hype. 6 chapters in and I was totally annoyed I had purchased it. The characters are not belivable. Christian Grey is mearly 26 and super accomplished...oh please. He acts and talks like he's in his mid 50's. The book gets a little better as you keep reading but not by much. The S&M scenes are very tamed. This book can easily appeal to the bored housewife w kids. I will not read the other books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app. When I want to remember where a verse is, all I have to do is bookmark it. The notetaking is great too. I am not handy at computer stuff, but this is an easy app to find my way around.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|very fun to play, simple, back-to-basics. dont expect anything flashy,tho.<br /><br />play against a friend, its MUCH MUCH more fun that way!

B007ZD17XO|5.0|I was a skeptical at first, but this game is actually very challenging, while still remaining fun. I highly recommend Treasures of Montezuma!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent, Excellent book! Was totally taken with the whole triology. Couldn't put them down, I read the 3 books in less than one week! The 3rd was my favorite as the ending totally put together the perfect conclusion to the trilogy. Will definately re-read all 3 books again.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I've seen all the big budget, blockbusters and this movie is my favorite from this past summer. Was it cheesy? Yes! Was it ridiculous? Yes! These are why it is so awesome. It's a musical about crazy 80's rock music and it is over the top and awesome. All the cast does awesome but Tome Cruise absolutley kills it. His singing is awesome and he plays the overy the top performer so well (what a surprise). The music was great, I was downloading it from I-Tunes halfway through the movie. The way they mashed up the songs was great too!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Heard about it through co-workers and was certainly NOT dissappointed!  While some people tend to think it is trashy, I did not feel this way.  I thought the book had a great storyline and well developed characters.  Have kept it on my kindle to re-read again!  Loved it!

B0085HWZDK|5.0|Forever facing an audience quite literally frothing at the gash to hear Led Zeppelin classics every time he plays live (and who can blame them) - to some extent Robert Plant has spent years distancing himself from that to establish a solo identity. And a truly genius move on his part was his \\"Raising Sand\\" album from 2007 with Alison Krauss - a captivating mixture of \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" old-timey Gospel and Country music given modern-day arrangements and a deliciously softened intimacy. Then came Part 2 of sorts in the \\"Band Of Joy\\" project/album from 2010.<br /><br />Filmed in 2011 in the gorgeous setting of the War Memorial Auditorium in Nashville in Tennessee - I mention these two CDs because in some ways \\"Live At The Artist's Den\\" feels like a live gig of both albums - with a few curveballs thrown in. And instead of Alison Krauss - we get Patty Griffin doing the female vocal honours - and she (like the rest of the band) absolutely rock.<br /><br />As for the main man - Robert Plant not only looks and sounds great on this fab BLU RAY (he can do a soft vocal caress or a rock-God scream on a dime) - it's thrilling to see that he is wholly relevant to 2012 and not just 1969. His present set list and song choices now encompass Blues, Gospel, Traditionals, Folk, Rock and World - and it all meshes into the most wonderfully uplifting sound. You can't quite nail down a genre for this but you know it's good. Throw in a truly stunning set of musicians backing him up (Buddy Miller and Darrell Scott on guitars in particular) - and Plant finally seems comfortable - glad to be on stage with these great people - even grinning with relish as he revisits rarely-heard Led Zep album tracks. Wisely too he gives solo slots to Miller, Scott and Griffin - all of whom carry the limelight with shockingly good voices and an ability to play most famous musicians under the table. The four even do an Acapella piece at the end that is more than impressive.<br /><br />But inevitably it's when the evening touches on stuff from Zep II like \\"Ramble On\\" and Zep III like \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"Gallows Pole\\" - then things just lift off into another stratosphere. Plant has re-arranged the songs so that they now sound like the unplugged feel of the \\"No Quarter\\" sessions but with a more rocking band and a grittier edge. The results are fantastic. There are also brilliantly reconstructed versions of \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock And Roll\\" from \\"Zep IV\\" and a funkily cool reworking of \\"Houses Of The Holy\\".<br /><br />Released July 2012 - the picture quality (on BLU RAY) is superb - the gig intimate - and the crowd responsive. And even if you don't know the newer material - the songs are very strong melodically and played with superb feeling by musicians who have a lifetime of musical knowledge flowing through their veins. The only downsides would be that the extras are short - and the gig could have been longer. I actually wanted more - and not less.<br /><br />To sum up - you can't help but feel that Percy has always been smart - constantly trying to evolve himself and his knowledge of what he loves. And this superbly musical gig sees him finally arrive at a place where he's here in his future and at peace with his past. And we mere mortals can get to enjoy both.<br /><br />Recommended like a \\"Hey Hey Mama...\\"t's when the evening touches on stuff from Zep II like \\"Ramble On\\" and Zep III like \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"Gallows Pole\\" - then things just lift off into another stratosphere.

B003R1B9MW|4.0|We rented this movie from Amazon Prime on our Playstation. The quality was great! We had no problems at all. I love the convenience of Amazon Prime!
B001CC7PKS|3.0|Though Daredevil is one of the more obscure figures in the pantheon of superheroes, he was nevertheless one of my personal favorites as a kid.  When the movie came out in 2003, I was basically pleased with the outcome.  Affleck is passable as the blind lawyer with superhuman senses.  The chemistry with Jennifer Garner's character, Elektra, works.  Good supporting performances from Joe Pantoliano and Jon Favreau, though Michael Clarke Duncan's Kingpin and Colin Farrell's Bullseye are both over the top, especially the latter.  The soundtrack is kicking, headlined by a couple of well-placed songs by up-and-coming (at that time) Goth band, Evanescence.  The special effects need some help in places, most noticeably the fight scene between Daredevil and Bullseye in the church, which is almost cartoonish.  All in all, it was a worthwhile movie.  Not the greatest superhero movie of all time, but worth watching.<br /><br />When the Director's Cut version appeared, I was interested.  It contains 21 additional minutes of footage, along with a number of special features.  Sadly, the longer version was disappointing to me.  It makes the film darker and grittier, but also slows it down.  The quality of the blu-ray transfer is fine, and the sound seems okay as well.  But it is a shame that the theatrical release was not included in this edition.  I would have liked the option of seeing it in hi-def.  So until they come out with a blu-ray version of the theatrical release, I will hold on to my DVD.
1442344288|5.0|I loved this book.  I didn't like the repetition... I mean how many times do you want to hear \\"the past is obdurate\\".  But, that aside, i was gripped by the story, I liked the characters and I cared about the end result.  Yeah, it got kinda weird there towards the end, looking at the future, and yeah, it was probably too long.  There were things that annoyed me about the way Jake did things, but then, that's the story, isn't it?<br /><br />I listened to the unabridged audio version and really enjoyed the narration.<br /><br />Sad as I felt at the end, it was another enjoyable King read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|We use this as our alarm clock on a DAILY bases. I HATE the sound of an alarm buzzing in the morning. This alarm gives me many alternative options including (one i have come to love) the Rooster. It starts off quiet (a feature) the progresses louder and it has a math problem setting. This causes me to come out of my sleep state to solve a problem. I am awake...Amen.
0142427837|4.0|My husband and I both read this while on vacation at the beach and we both loved it.  Neither of us could put it down until we finished it.  It's very dark and an emotional roller coaster and the end... those endings make me crazy.  It was definitely food for discussion.  Funny how different people get a different train of thought.  Overall, a good read if you enjoy the type of story that will disturb you.
B0030B624E|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I usually prefer a more \\"realistic\\" take on zombies, but this movie is better the way it is.<br /><br />I sort of wish this movie were a miniseries or something.  I would like to see more of this sort of thing.<br /><br />There's one minor thing that really bothers me: the movie implies that zombies are caused by mad cow disease and then implies that it's a virus.  Mad cow disease is actually caused by a prion.  I realize this is just a fictional movie, and I realize that this is a minor point completely irrelevant to the movie.  But it really irritates me when people get their facts wrong.

I read this article online that suggested this DVD as a way to expand from my usual workouts: [...]  I ordered this DVD and it's just what I needed. The instruction is motivating and I'm using different muscle groups, tricking my muscles beyond my usual routine. There are three levels, each with increasing intensity.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />Update: The DVD is great, but if you have any knee issues, it is tough on your knees, even when you do the exercises exactly how the video shows.

B006DHAT5K|4.0|Like my title indicates, this movie was surprisingly funny and had a naked Chris Evans. I mean come on, you don't need much more than naked Chris Evans. Besides that, this movie was surprisingly funny and endearing. Anna Faris tones down her usual over-the-top antics for a more normal take at a neurotic 20-something. Chris Evans is charming and funny and clothes-spontaneously-combusting hot, which adds to the watchability. Yes, it was pretty predictable, but what rom com isn't? Bottom line, I watched this the first time for Chris Evans in all his shirtless glory, but I keep watching it because it makes me laugh and has a feel good ending. And because of Chris Evans in all his shirtless glory.
0307730697|5.0|Wow, what an amazing read!  Suggested by a good friend, I ordered Fearless and started reading it - and couldn't put it down.  The amazing story of Adam Brown - his life, his struggles, his triumph and ultimately his incredible love and sacrifice for others is so compelling.  There are so many outstanding teaching principles from this book - great resource for every parent looking for an engaging book as a connection point to talk with their teens about some of the most significant and profound issues of the day.  Get it, read it, then give it to your teens to read - you'll have tons to talk about!  From the perspective of a Christian parent, you need to understand that there is some rather strong language in the book - Blehm does a great job of at least dropping the most egregious language, but you should be aware of this in determining what age is appropriate for reading this book.  At the very least there are very powerful sections of this book that you can read to your children if they are too young to read the entire book themselves.
0345803485|5.0|You'll be glued to this trilogy to the point where you'd rather hide out and read than socialize.  Addicting-sexy, romantic, playful, and mysterious.

B005NFW0U0|5.0|I am a huge fan of this show. Season 3 was awesome!!! Cant wait for 4! So glad I could get it on amazon. Instant video is one of my favorite things about being a prime member
B0052VUNHC|3.0|An adequate book for the beach, the boat or vacation. The story is sufficiently interesting that it will draw you back. At the same time, it is not so captivating that you can't put it down. It might be somewhat more engaging for someone in his 20's or 30's. The writing is actually better than passable, at times it is rather good.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Very good story acting was done by  real enlisted , worth watching beginning to end heart filled , makes you proud to be American just to know our military is there willing to do what is right

B003HE2B9E|3.0|A bit too poppy. Saw her with Alice Cooper and she was amazing. Solo, not so good. Kind of disappointing.
034580404X|5.0|I had heard so much about these books that I had to read them and see what they were about.  I could not believe how fast these books read and wonder how a movie will be about Christian Grey.  I have loaned the books to friends and will wait to see what they thought about the books. If you like erotica, you will like these books!
0345803507|5.0|Good book just like the other three before it, check them all out they are worth reading and buying, you won't regret it
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a great read about a woman facing odds and triumphing.  I felt like I was right there with her along the journey.  Her adventure took such courage and is really an inspiring story.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Wonderful movie!!  A great movie for adults as well as the younger generation.  Would recommend it for anyone that enjoys good movies.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|A Moving interpretation with Helen Mirren in the lead.  The film's pace and tone and imagery allows Shakespeare's story to unfold within its own mystery and mysticism.  Taymor reads the plot as a ritual of redemption and reclamation.  Casting Mirren as the dispossessed regent seems to recall a primeval epoch,  and through its ancient magic restore the now wizened goddess queen (see Robert Graves' \\"The White Goddess\\") to her rightful seat.  Perhaps not Shakespeare's exact intention, but certainly an exploration of treachery, usurpation, and a return to power . . . and here through the marriage of the present to the ancient.  A bold and intelligent undertaking, cosmically connected and beautifully wrought.  It's too easy to use Shakespeare to make superficial connections to contemporary events and sensibilities; it is much harder to make manifest Shakespeare's nearly synaptic display of human patterns and movements. Einstein saw the universe without; Shakespeare watched it work within. Taymor has tapped that vein. She works on a different level than Kenneth Branagh, and I thank the spirits for both.
B0016K40KO|5.0|I already own an old DVD version of Bridge on the River Kwai, but when I saw this collector's edition with all the added information about the filming, I knew I had to have it.<br /><br />I've visited the bridge, which is still standing in Thailand, on 3 separate occasions,and also the JEATH museum which is an outdoor replica of the various camps which existed on the river. And, in an effort to see where the movie was actually filmed, visited Sri Lanka (Ceylon) but due to the fighting with the Tamil Tigers, was unable to get to the actual film site.  I think this is one of the finest films ever made and I'm delighted that it is available for me to see many, many times.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a great distraction,  you can try getting 3 gnomes on every level for a more challenging version.  Worth the. 99 cents
B0087240Z4|4.0|I'm admitted fan of the 90's era Smashing Pumpkins, but was pleasantly surprised by 'Oceania'.  Certainly not very similar to their earlier works, but an interesting direction for the band to go in.<br /><br />Corgan stated in an interview that he doesn't like to dwell on the past and that he doesn't even like to play some of the older material, so this is an excellent opportunity for fans to decide if they are in it for the long-haul.

1594744769|1.0|My daughter read this book and loved it. A friend of hers recomended it. I decided to read it because I thought it was a horror/thriller theme. At the beggining it is, but as you continue to read, there's a part where it tanforms to a fantasy adventure story. The story itself is new and very creative, definitively a page turner. I'm glad to know there will be a sequel.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book just sucks. Don't waste your time, don't believe the hype. I read almost the whole book thinking it would get better, it didn't. Better of getting a porno!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I  like this film. Good pace, amazing effects, intriguing story that makes you want to hear more, it was the perfect night's worth of entertainment. Also, a worthy take on classical Ed Burroughs novels - the mixing and matching from the various books was imo a good thing, as was the new take on the Therns. The only downside was a surplus of schmaltziness but i guess this cannot be avoided in movies like this. I wish (against hope) that Disney will go for the 2nd installment.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Such a fun game! Just enough to be a challenge to keep you interested and not too frustrated 8-) I recommend this game to anyone!
0141032006|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that the book came with a sticker of the Anne Frank Huis. I will buy used books more often.
B004J64QSI|1.0|The video editing and sound quality of this product is very disappointing, especially considering the expense that went into creating and assembling this talented cast.  Originally, I was so thrilled to receive the 25th Anniversary edition and then after watching it I was blown away with how poorly the editing was done.  It's too bad since the star studded cast had to have sounded incredible that night!  Previously, I had watched it on youtube in segments and decided to invest in a copy.  I feel like the YouTube segments were superior for sound quality than the real thing.  Disappointing since there was such a talented ensemble.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I am just on my second reading of the trilogy fifty shades  and it was a fabulous read, oblivious as I'm reading it again. The one thing that really annoyed me about all three of the books was the constant repeating of certain sentences. The discription of Christians hips and how jeans sit on them was  just the same nearly every time the had sex and well, that,s quite a lot in this book. I think they could have made two or maybe one decent book without the repeative descriptions.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the rummest game on my device its so much fun plus its free which is great I would definitly download it on ur device if u like fun apps
B000EGDB10|4.0|4-1/2 stars for 1998's Mission Impossible. I'm not a particular fan of Tom Cruise or action movies, but I do love a good thriller. MI fit the bill perfectly. You must watch MI with careful attention to really savor all it has to offer.<br /><br />Unlike too many action films, MI has a solid script, a smart plot that fits together like a well-made puzzle, gorgeous location photography, dry humor, not a dull moment, and even some top-drawer acting in Jon Voight and a scrumptious (the only word I can think of that quite captures it) turn by Vanessa Redgrave. The two show-stopping action set pieces still thrill 14 years after the release date. MI makes a terrific movie night. The only reason I docked a half-star is I figured out the plot twist early on. My family liked it so much we watched it twice in two nights, and picked up more clever plot details during the second viewing.<br /><br />Parent note: There is violence but it's not particularly gruesome, and a few swear words. I had no problem with my 9-year-old seeing it. He pronounced it, in verbal all-caps bold-face italic, \\"epic.\\"
B005SZAEYO|5.0|This is a must see! It truly is amazing! Scary, creepy and a good story! I saw it last year when is was on FX. I hated the ending though. Can't wait till the second season!

B004LROUW2|5.0|This is an amazing book about an alternate universe and the couple most affected.  In rural Japan, Tengo and Anomane are friends in the same primary school. On the day they first hold hands, they experience an extraordinary jolt, but don't realize it is a time warp.  Later that day, Anomane carries out her plan to run away from home to escape her abusive father, who is the leader of a fanatical religious cult.<br /><br />She and Tengo are separated until they are 30 years old, when they both come to realize that the moment of their holding hands is the strongest emotion either one has ever felt. They want to find one another to see if the other one feels the same, but they have led completely different lives that have, non-the-less, led to the Tokyo area.  Tengo, the young man, has recently been ghost writing a short novel dictated by a mysterious teenager who tells the story of Little People who may have developed the ability to create a time warp via air chrysalis.  Anomane has become a self-defense trainer at a club where she gains the respect of an older, wealthy woman who admires her skills and demeanor.  The two women discover a mutual hatred of men who have tortured or murdered the women in their lives but escaped punishment, which they intend to remedy. The adventures of Tengo and Anomane balloon from there into fantastic narratives of their attempts to cross time and space.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I bought this and a Sandisk alternative and this one wins between the two.<br /><br />This one comes with a lanyard and isn't much thicker than the micro-SD card itself.<br /><br />Perfect. Now I just need an amazing deal on a 64GB micro-SD card :)
030758836X|3.0|It is a slow story. It is diary style, if you don't mind that. I haven't gotten into much action yet in the book. I am hoping it livens up some.
B001NESPHC|5.0|True music from a true artist. In light of the garbage \\"New World Order\\" music on the radio nowadays, it's nice to find an artist that didn't have to sell her soul for fame! This entire album is amazing!  Ms. Gardot has such a connection with her lyrics, her voice is full of emotion. Baby I'm a fool..just lovely! I could never get tired of this album! Thank you Ms. Gsrdot for the sensual vocals. Worrisome Heart was great but I have to say she out did herself on this album. If you're into jazz/blues this is for you. Highly recommended!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Would give it 5 stars but for the volume of ads. They pop up for every game (wouldn't mind so much every third or fifth game). Luckily they aren't popping up outside the app (yet?).
B004AUGJS8|2.0|Shallow, manipulative, and uninspired retelling of a true story. Frank Langella was excellent.  Dunst was beautiful.  Otherwise . . . not worth the time.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|This movie had a lot of chances to get things right, and messed up most of them.<br /><br />1.The dancer's life.<br />Nina is a dancer, sort of. She doesn't seem to have any passion for it. Where _A Chorus Line_ or _Billy Elliott_ had you rooting for the poor dancer to make it because of the passion felt for dancing, Nina just seems to show up. She wants to WIN, she wants to get the part, but she doesn't seem to want to dance. So I can't root for her there.<br />2.The plot of _Swan_Lake_. Uhm. The Black Swan is not the slutty Bizarro world White Swan. The Prince falls for her (Odile) because he thinks she is the sweet Odette. It's a pivotal part of the movie, and it's all wrong.<br />3.The dialogue. Dear god, I don't know if I've heard anything this stiff and overwrought since _The Brady Bunch_. Marcia Marcia Marcia! I pity the actors that had to say these things.<br />4.The costumes. Again, obvious and overdone. Nina in pink and white, even wearing a white feather scarf? Really?<br />5.Basic medicine. Dancing well with glass in your abdomen is unlikely.<br /><br />OK if you want me to suspend my disbelief and just go for the creepy otherworld feel, you have to give me a character to feel for, and there isn't one.<br /><br />But I liked the soundtrack. The soundtrack was an excellent blend of classical and modern.
B00846REIS|4.0|this was a \\"fun\\" book to read at the beach. VERY much like Fifty Shades of Gray\\". I'm not sure which book came out first.  I liked the story but the sex scenes got boring. Too much information!
1416550550|5.0|I found this at Barnes and Noble and loved the cover and the story sounded interesting. It was a wonderful story that  made its way through generations. Loved it! I gave it to my mother-in-law to borrow and sent a copy to my grandfather.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well, what can I say I have fallen in Love with 50 shades of Grey and Ana and Mr. Christian Grey. It has been an amazingly sexy adventure to read about and I had a difficult time putting the book down.
0062206281|5.0|If you have read either of Carlos Ruiz Zafon's previous novels, you are in for a great treat.  Daniel and Fermin are at it again.  Ruiz Zafon's imagery brought me right into the story- both of their present time and during the horrible times of Franco's Spain, as if I was a cast member watching from the side.  I could not put this down!  I only hope that the next novel in this series comes out quickly!!!!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This book is recycled material and too long.  Woman with magic/vampire romance - been done more than a few times recently.  The best one is Sunshine by Robin McKinley.  I gave up on the book because I felt I'd read it before and it was so long, I didn't see myself enjoying it until the end.  Might be ok if you haven't read it three times already.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Tons of fun and hard to put down. Just want to keep going and going. Definitely a 5 star app!
B0079K4WEE|4.0|A very interesting story with a different twist. A lot of detail to take in so you have to pay attention and watch more than once. The lead actors handled their parts well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|LOVED it. Once I made it through the weird and boring diary entries in the beginning, it all cam together and the twists and turns were fantastic!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Totally entertainment lecture, easy to read and already looking for the different releases from Suzanne Collins. At the beginning I thought would be more allocated for the young but not at all, everyone would have fun with the plot.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have used these phones for mixing live music (5 voices w/ CD track) at outside and inside venues.  They work great!  The dB reduction is not extraordinary, but definitely good enough to work.  I wish they had the option for a side to flip away from the ear, but I am able to have one side on an ear and the other rest against my head when necessary.  They sound great plugged into a computer or mp3 player.  I appreciate that the 1/8\\"to1/4\\" adapter screws in to the phones, but this may limit its use to only these phones.  I can use the adapter on my apple ear buds, but not an 1/8\\" to 1/8\\" chord.
030758836X|2.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The characters had me reading on and on from the beginning.  Amy and Nick, the perfect beautiful young couple whose lives take a turn when they have to move to Missouri from Amy's beloved life in New York.  Amy becomes isolated and Nick more distant, then the intrigue of what happened to Amy kept me turning page after page.  Unfortunately, the end is very disappointing.  It leaves you with \\"That's it?  I read this entire book and this is how it ends?\\"  If there were to be a sequel to this book, the end might make sense, otherwise the end remains very unsatisfying.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|The Tourist is a good movie; it is filled with suspense and  a surprise ending. If you like action movies with a sense of purpose, you will like this movie. Enjoy this movie with a friend.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I typically don't care for books that are not in our current era but this was suggested by my daughter and I had a difficult time putting it down. It was a great story and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0088WGBC8|1.0|The plot line of this movie is long, disjointed and boring. What a waste of good actors. The thread of who was doing what to whom was hard to follow and the action scenes were obvious green screen effects. I'm sorry I wasted the money.
0439023513|5.0|I really enjoyed this 3rd and final book of the trilogy. It seemed more gruesome/brutal than the other 3. I think it may just be that you are reading from Kat's experience. In the first book she was an innocent. In this last book, her actions are very purposeful and driven by hate/anger. I am glad I read it so that I could have \\"closure\\", but I hesitate to let my 11 year old finish the series.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this movie. The action will keep you on the edge of your seat, no doubt preparing you for the last of this trilogy. The entire trilogy ends the Batman saga way too soon.  A must see movie!
B004ZISVWC|3.0|Over the past year or so, I've heard tons about Trollhunter but no one ever told me if they thought it was good or not. That's usually a sign of a so-so movie in my book, and after finishing it up a few minutes ago, that's exactly how I saw it. Keep in mind that I'm not saying it's a bad movie or that I hated it, just that I don't find it to be anything special apart from having some pretty good special effects for a fake documentary movie. Trollhunter is shot very well and the tension in some scenes had me wondering how the heck the film crew was going to get out of the heavier situations, but this is yet another movie that was getting good only to come to a screeching halt thanks to a standard ending. The worst part is, some things aren't even explained very well in said ending.<br /><br />Three students: Thomas, Johanna and Kalle are filming a documentary about mysterious bear killings in their home country of Norway. They quickly discover that a strange man, Hans, thought to be a poacher, is always around with the local bear hunters, and they follow him to find out if he's the one responsible. It turns out that he hunts trolls. No, he's not a message board moderator, but he packs up a bunch of hunting gear and heads off into the woods at night to look for huge trolls. After pestering Hans long enough, he lets them tag along and record his adventures. Their first encounter leaves one of them wounded, but he pulls through with nothing but a nasty cut. We also find out that there's a government agency (go figure) that prevents the public from knowing the truth about trolls, but at this point in his career, Hans doesn't care one way or another if someone tries to let everyone know.<br /><br />The first thing I have to mention about this movie is how great Hans is. Played by famous Norwegian comedian Otto Jespersen, the character of Hans could've been done as a regular quiet, lone wolf kind of guy, but he gives the kids all the information they want regarding trolls.He might not necessarily care if they die while they're with him, but he also tries to let them know what to do. This was a great change of pace from similar characters, and I can only imagine the surprise audiences in Norway got when such a big name in comedy was in charge of killing off massive trolls. That'd be like seeing Lewis Black or Louis C.K. in a similar role. As I said earlier, the special effects were very good, and an escape scene halfway through the movie looks so good you'd think that the trolls were people in big costumes. It was great learning all kinds of things about the trolls in the movie, including a big one about them being able to sniff out Christians. Don't take that as an anti-religion thing, because they don't play it like that. It's just one of those things that could save someone's life, even the whole group's. I only wish it had been explained better, since they never discuss where the trolls came from or if they're a kind of unholy demon.<br /><br />I don't start ratings at 5 stars and then go down as things get worse...so Trollhunter managed to stay right in the middle of the road for the most part. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars. Whenever a troll got killed off, I'd raise my eyebrows over how cool and realistic it looked. Hans carries the movie while the 3-4 kids are just really there to film everything without the viewer getting attached. That stupid ending is what gets me though. I know that 'found footage' movies seem to always end the same way, but why not try something new here? Why even make it a found footage movie? Why not just make it be something that the cameraman just gave to someone to show the world? It's weird that we're still on this kind of thing 10+ years after The Blair Witch Project came out. Add to that the fact that what even happens isn't made clear, and that the movie just kind of ends, and the wind's taken out of the sails big time. I also wish that a little more had happened during most of the movie, because while I liked learning about the trolls, it would've been nice to see Hans do his thing more than a couple of times.<br /><br />Trollhunter's worth watching at least once. Good special effects, a great central character and some tense moments, but it doesn't do anything new for the found footage/fake documentary genre.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Bought for my son, no problems at all. Very pleased with purchase and reasonable shipping. The product was exactly as I expected. :) Highly recommend this purchase for BTR fans.
B00006AW2L|4.0|Most people familiar with pre-Sgt. Pepper classic rock are aware of US/UK versions of albums coming from British bands.  It was typical practice for the US record companies to change up tracklistings, especially by putting successful singles on the US versions to make the LP more palatable to casual fans of the time, or in the eyes of the record companies, to US listeners.  The Stones are the only band I'm aware of that makes it a practice to release both versions of albums, even though completests will already have all the songs on various albums.<br /><br />Few albums have sparked as much debate over which version is better than \\"Aftermath\\" has.  Growing up in the States I was mainly familiar with the US version, and it is still the version I prefer (to the horror of some Stones purists), but it does have its own weaknesses.  The biggest weakness AND strength of the US version is the inclusion of \\"Paint It, Black\\", one of the aforementioned singles that was put on the US version as the opening number.  This significantly raises the value of the US version in my mind, as it is one of The Rolling Stones greatest songs and one of the greatest songs of all time, period.  The problem with this, especially as an opening number, is that it sets the bar way too high for the rest of the album, and sets the tone for an album which doesn't exist.  Because we go straight from one of the most haunting and original rock songs of all time straight into a generic mid-60's pop number \\"Stupid Girl\\", and while the album has a few other highlights (\\"Under My Thumb\\", \\"I Am Waiting\\", etc) it never lives up to the excitement and tone set by \\"Paint It, Black\\".  The rest of the album not only sounds like a different project, it almost doesn't seem like the same band.<br /><br />So what about the UK version?  Well, it doesn't have a song as powerful as \\"Paint It, Black\\", but that also helps the album flow a little more smoothly.  While I don't think \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" is nearly as great an opening number as \\"Paint It, Black\\", it does set the tone for the album, and actually fits in, as opposed to sticking out like a sore thumb.  It's sort of a strange trade-off, the UK version is missing one of the greatest songs, but rather than starting off an above average album with a perfect 10 of a song, it starts off an above average album with an above average song.<br /><br />I think the bottom line, in my opinion of course, is that the US version has better songs, but the UK version is a better all-around album, because it feels more like an album and has more continuity.  I guess which one I prefer depends on my listening habits that day.  If I want to put on an album and listen to it all the way through as an overall experience, the UK version is the way to go, if I'm just skipping around listening to songs I like, the US version has a stronger tracklisting.  Plus, there is the fact that the UK version is the album the band intended to put out, which should count for something.  Also, if you own any compilation album by the band you will have \\"Paint It, Black\\" in your catalog already, so it's not necessary to buy the US version to have it.  And completests will have every song from both versions on various compilations.<br /><br />Like I said, it's a strange trade-off and a sticky debate, so I suggest you buy both.  Or at the very least buy one of them to complete your catalog and make a UK or US playlist by piecing together the tracks from the rest of your Stones catalog.
B0083GPDBO|5.0|The preview doesn't do this film justice. It was far better than any expectations that I had. I thought I was going to hate the point of view camera aspect. The POV was wonderfully done and not too shaky like other films that have taken this type of film making. The special effects were wonderfully done without any fake feeling to them. The story was great and I can't wait for this director to come out with another film.
B0081OAHW8|5.0|I listened to this album countless times back in college when it first came out. Came across it sort of by accident when browsing through MP3s, and had to get it. I enjoyed it as much as I did decades ago -- simply wonderful. I've aged; Clarke's sound has not.<br /><br />There's also a live version of the title track on the album \\"Stanley Clarke, Larry Carlton, Billy Cobham, Deron Johnson & Najee Live At The Greek\\" (along with a number of equally great tracks) that you must hear as well.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommend.
B007ED9FIY|5.0|Characters appeared true with story line. Scenery and residents reflected the real Hawaii as opposed to the Utopia we imagine. Family issues and story line were not sugar coated or artificial. A very good movie.  I was not disappointed and would recommend it to all ages.  A must see!
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|This is the second book in the Nikki Heat series and it was enjoyable. I immediately started the third book in the series, Heat Rises, and I liked it beter than either the first or second book.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Yes, I am the person that drops, spills, falls, slips...you get the idea. I am very pleased with my purchase.  Tested it first, as recommended, put it on and poof -waterproof.  The iPhone capabilities are not hampered at all...which I thought would be an issue. I don't mind the trade off...so I have to use an Apple cord...and the headphone adapter requires a bit of effort but the phone is waterproof!!. So, yes, get one! Hopefully, you will be as pleased as I am.
B008MEM24S|3.0|I think it's cool that they can out with Where's My Perry. But I just wish they could come out with a free version.

B000000OXH|5.0|This album is, and possibly with no competitor, the best Asia album. Among the three first Asia albums, this one shines absolutely alone.<br /><br />When Asia appeared after the end of the activity of the majority of classic 60's english bands(the greatest ones ever), they only want to do music. But mediocre critics with a very bad intention called them immediately \\"superband\\", just to say after that they coudn't reach the world's expectations.<br /><br />I believe they were there only doing what they know and like to do, very good music. But critics, that are only frustrated musicians, were at the front door expecting the release of their first album just to say \\"ah, we were in the right, we've said that they couldn't fit the expectation\\". Rsrsrsrs, ridiculous.<br /><br />The first Asia album is powerful, really powerfull, but they were trying to find their way, and they found it fast in the second album, the true Asia album as it should be, the real Asia sonority, the real Asia flavour, a superb, tasty, bautiful, melodic, with moments of absolute geniality from all members, Wetton's voice is superb here, Palmer's playing is perfect as always, Downes is a gifted keyboardist, but really genius moments came mainly from Steve Howe, with his superior guitar playing technique. Steve delivered here, in this album, some of the best, delightful guitar moments in popular world's music history.<br /><br />Since the first song \\"Don't cry\\", they showed they had chosen their way.<br />Is a melodic album, with songs, like a Beatles album, a song album, and we have some of the most beautiful songs ever composed here, there are songs that I can't imagine any other one so beautiful, when I put this album to play(vinyl), I repeat \\"Never in a million years\\" about ten times, or more, I simply can't avoid to do it, so beautiful this song is. \\"Eye to Eye\\" is that moment I said about Howe's superior technique, at the end of this song he shows how to play a guitar, there are no guitarristcompared to him in his personal style, he is unique. \\"The last to know\\" another superb, beautiful song, as perfect as a good song can be.<br /><br />And so the album ends with two perfect songs, I can imagine only The Beatles doing songs with such a perfection, \\"Midnight sun\\" and the perfect song to close an album in high level, \\"Open your eyes\\", wow. Just after finished you will put on play again, and again, and again.<br /><br />For you all that love music, as it was the most important thing in life, BUY THIS ALBUM, DON'T LOOSE YOUR TIME READING CRITICS, THEY WANTED TO COMPOSE AND PLAY LIKE THESE GUYS PLAY. THEY ARE FRUSTRATED. IT IS A MAGNUM ASIA'S OPUS, I DOUBT IF THEY WILL PUT ANOTHER ONE OUT THAT EVEN COULD BE COMPARED TO THIS ONE.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|With all the brouhaha, I figured it was a must read with a unique approach to graphic sex to rise above the usual porn novels.  The first love scene was truly sweat-producing, but after that, her descriptions of Christian became pretty repetitive. The plot was interesting enough to want to know how the trilogy ends besides the predictable fact that you know they'll end up together, but not enough for me to want to buy the other two books. I coerced a friend who had read all three books to spill, and I was satisfied, although I would have liked to know more of Christian's backstory.
B007SGM084|1.0|It is difficult to review this item since I never received it.  Where is it?  Have I been charged for the book?

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good time filler.A lot of the games are very<br />addictive just needs to slow down with the adds.<br />Great game for kids to play and for adults bored.
B000Y1H7VA|4.0|The songs on this album are catchy and a little dark at times but over all id say its every bit as good as any of your own personal favorite pumpkin albums. i was a little skeptical,being a hardcore fan,that this wouldnt be up to par compared to earlier pumpkin albums but it really does fit with the best. billy corgan is an excellent song writer. couple that with jimmy chamberlins perfect drumming and youve got more of what the pumpkins have always been; a two man group. a very good two man group!the dvd that came with it was neat for a small glimpse 'behind the music' but it really wasnt very long. made me wanting more. thats the dvd, the cd is great though.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|it has some gliches. but it is awesome if you like defence. games.  i think it is okay but don't take my word for it take yours.
0345803485|1.0|Oh my heck! Really? Seriously? A best-seller? Has Twilight dumb-downed everyone?<br /><br />I'm a serious reader, so I decided to see what the fuss is about. Straight-up, it's Twilight without vampires and lots and lots of submissive/dominator porn.<br /><br />I will NOT be giving this to my 20-year old daughter to read because there is some whacked-out, not normal sex (referred to as \\"vanilla\\" sex) in this. The main characters have (or will have) major issues that require a life-time of therapy to unravel. If you're a frustrated housewife on vacation, okay, maybeeee I can see wasting your valuable reading time, but otherwise it's just ridiculous and you'll never get those hours back.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I've been playing this game for a while and its really fun and everyone is nice on the game. So I think everyone should love this game tellnfriends about it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this app. It's challenging, but not so challenging that you get frustrated or waste tons of time on it. After mastering the levels designed for a smart phone, I figured I'd try the Tablet levels as well, and they are easy to play and use even on the smaller smartphone screen. Great game.
B001E8WNNO|5.0|Great movie. An avid fan of King, the movie is true to the essence of the book, and a pleasure to watch. Definitely one of my all-time favorites. It's a great flick to lose yourself into. Imagination imprinted on film in a manner that will never grow old, and a story line that will suck you in, every time.<br /><br />Thank You, Amazon!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Loved it, better than book 4 so far, and I am looking forward to reading book 5.  The series mirrors the show on HBO closely and it is nice to get the detail here that is left out of the episodes.
145210655X|5.0|I thought the book very cute and very funny, with beautiful illustrations. Worth every penny. My son and I like very much and we were very pleased. The delivery was on time.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Thanks to this little book I was able to successfully format, correct and update my first Kindle novel. It's easy to follow and direct. It is the essential first read for those wishing to become Kindle authors.

B008BRC6NS|5.0|i recently bought this album of hers and i think that it was very well put together. i like all the songs she put on this album they are very good songs. i think that she did a great job of putting this album together. so anyone who is a big jlo fan who does not have it should buy it.it is worth the wait. chrisfan.
B001JFZ118|3.0|The movie is what I remembered but the sound was horrible I had to raise the volume on my system above the norm. Otherwise good
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book draws you in, as to place you into whats going on in the book. I felt like I was right in the mist of the hunger games with Peeta and Katniss. Wonderful book for all!
B0088P2A7A|3.0|This app is worse than than pulling up a page in the browser because it doesn't seem to support multiple pages (wikipedia without tab explosion?) and I couldn't get it to copy and paste, though that may be specific to my device. Plus there's a data overhead to just opening the app, it loads the front page.<br /><br />It's better than a browser in how it renders pages, I have to say that part of it is pretty nice.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|I am definitely not in the show's target audience, but I was flipping through the channels last winter and found the christmas special to be great tv. The witty lines and great clothes reminded me of Mad Men. Also their is a maid that is just like Betty Draper.<br /><br /> You have to watch both seasons in order to get what is going on. Also you should look at the little blurbs about each character on the website. Because their are so many of them,and quite a few characters wear uniforms and look exactly the same. The pacing is super fast , if you go to the bathroom, pause it because if you don't you be lost the rest of the episode. I like watching the maids work in the kitchen ,reminded me of my working in a restaurant.<br /><br />Some of the character's stories are so cliched and overought,  but other character's like Bates and Anna make you weep with emotion because you want life to work out ok for them. It is not like the usual period , because so much humour has been carefully injected into it. Mrs. Patmore and Mrs. Hugh's are funny without meaning to be.Lord Grantham interacting with his dog and Daisy and her 'sweetheart' are hysterical.
B00138EV8U|5.0|This shows young love in action and the consequence of that action. Then what to do about it. Very good preforming the dances scenes.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a great game. It is just like the original Super Mario Bros.  I definitely recommend it!!<br />(I only give it 4 out of 5 stars. I have yet to go all the way though it and I don't know what may lie ahead. So far I have had no problem with any slowness or glitches on my Kindle Fire.)
B007XELMO4|4.0|I love hiking and I love photography. People with the same hobbies will know how difficult it is to have your camera instantly accessible and secure at the same time.<br />The Cotton Carrier Strap Shot achieves this perfectly and I highly recommend it to any one in the same situation as me. As a plus, the strap comes with the Cotton Carrier's Hand Strap so no need to buy it!<br />The only con I have for this product is that the end of strap to tie it to my backpack it's a bit unraveled already.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Excellent well thought out book, great examples, metaphors, analogies, simple, yet complex, great pictures to illustrate the points. I really enjoyed this book and found it hard to quit reading.
B00846TTDG|4.0|movie is amazing. not over-dramatized- just lifelike footage that makes you feel you are actually with the men. very good movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is addictive for a while but then I got all of the achievements except the 10 million club one. I got this a long time ago. It is buggy and it sometimes messes me up. You can also adjust the sensitivity for those complaining about the reaction time. The sound are weird and it delays but you can always turn it off. For some reason, its picture won't show up unless it's in my carousel, so I didn't put it in my favorites. Overall, I think it's worth downloading. By the way, just because somebody rated it five stars doesn't mean it's fake.
B003EYVXVY|5.0|The product arived in good condition and on time.  Although more expensive, it is worth it; this is the way \\"Avitar\\" should be seen.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This is a great album, and I write this as someone who probably wouldn't listen much to her earlier stuff --- not because it's not good but simply because it's a little too staid and \\"coffee-shoppy\\" for me. Not so this album. Yes it features her lovely voice and feminine pretty-girl lyrics, but the band behind her is full-blooded and smart. Simply a great album.
B005FISBTO|5.0|There is no need to scroll and read the paragraphs of these wonderful 'critics' below and above me. This show is fantastic, every year. Buy it, watch it, enjoy it.
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|i have been a fan of beach house ever since i heard gila, the strong vocals and pop infused songwriting got me hooked... then along comes teen dream, what can i say? it is one of those albums that seamlessly progresses through each song without sounding like it is a repeat of a theme... that brings us to bloom, and again there is that quality of knowing that these songs belong together, but each one has a power of it's own... for longer listens, if you are still wondering if you will like it, go to itunes, but for $2.99 i suggest you just buy it, you won't regret it...
B0085776BG|4.0|fun movie, makes you feel proud...didnt like the flow of the dialogue, seemed over rehearsed and unnatural. good story though.
B007SGM084|5.0|Sexually explicit, not for the timid. The story line amd the way the book was written was excellent. I hope Christian's side of the story is told.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very easy to use. I can always find what I need. The selection of reading plans is also nice.
B000I9UA30|4.0|America has a new independence day. This is the story that is full of action, some romance, a little comedy and more action.  By the time it concludes you're worn out and proud to be a human.  Have fun and watch this fantasy?.
B006BARXUI|5.0|This is one of the best books ever written. But then I love all her books. Full of history, love, this book has it all.

B0083GR6Y6|1.0|I did not enjoy this movie very much at all.  It was very unrealistic and disappointing.  I would not recommend it to friends.
B0063IH60K|4.0|it's a bit hard to get a win in this game, but it is a fast game and you can design your own background from your images and make it all pretty and interesting!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I previewed this songs a few times before finally purchasing the album. After listening to it twice, I was HOOKED. This album is simply amazing like nothing I have ever heard before. My favorite song is Radio, there is just something about it that lifts my spirits. For those who enjoy this album, I highly suggest purchasing the deluxe songs as well, they're just as good. I've never heard of Lana before but she's an amazing artist!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great ap. Had problems with heat, this ap was a great help for the DROID x.  Also hoped in changing the battery usage so you can get the phone tweak to run longer in a charge.

B00846TRHY|5.0|A hard subject but well worth knowing about.. some people are willing to risk it all. This movie is about just that action.

B004GCPJDQ|5.0|When Apple released their 6-pack of rechargeable batteries, I purchased a set. Soon after, I purchased two more sets. One for the office and another one to up the number of available batteries. You see, I started using the batteries in all of my electronics which required AA batteries. They're that good. Sadly, Apple has yet to provide a batteries only option. No biggie.<br /><br />But as time passed, laziness got the best of me. That and other people in the office started pulling the charged batteries from the wall charger. Someone in the office decided they liked a Microsoft mouse better than the Magic Mouse. His decision threw the entire balance of the office off by only requiring one AA. After the fifth time getting up and seeing only one available charged battery, I went on to Amazon and ordered the Mobee Inductive Charger. I had heard things about inductive charging before. Mostly about phone cases. The idea is simple, remove your existing AA batteries, put the Apple battery door away and drop the Mobee battery pack in. Some people complained about poor fit or charging experience. I can say that as long as you properly seat the battery cell, the inductive charger does its thing.<br /><br />I no longer have to hunt for AA batteries. Now I just need to get into the habit of placing the mouse on the charging pad whenever I step away for the night. The only thing that would make this product better is if the pad was not required to charge. But then it wouldn't be \\"inductive\\", it would be something even more magical. (Btw, I ordered another setup, it works that well.)

B005LAII0I|5.0|Great film to pass down in video collections..I am a Julia Robersts fan and a Disney fan..Acutally, it will make the Disney version better to watch because they did build most of the script around Julia Roberts. The presentation seemed more like a stage performance than the Disney cartoon fantacy style..
B005IQZB14|5.0|Memoirs are my favorite genre of books and Strayed's Wild did not disappoint.  I thought her writing was honest and real and I enjoyed her story of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail as she came to terms with her past.  This is a book that I will definitely read again.

B008E374T0|5.0|Well, The Gaslight Anthem have done it again, proving they are among the elite of modern rock bands.  Take a look at their catalog: Sink Or Swim, The '59 Sound, American Slang, and now Handwritten.  Throw in some EP's (Senor And The Queen), some great covers on compilationgs (God's Gonna Cut You Down and Changing Of The Guards), and a nearly perfect side project from Brian Fallon (The Horrible Crowes) and it is a wonder that Brian Fallon and The Gaslight Anthem is not a household influence by now.  They have not done anything short of excellence.<br /><br />With Handwritten, The Gaslight Anthem have delivered a perfect mix of their first three full length albums: the energetic punk of Sink Or Swim, the nostalgia of The '59 Sound, and the bluesy feel of American Slang.  Brian Fallon once again delivers lyrics like no other, cutting you deep with emotion and nostalgia, all the while making it believable and not forced.  Songs like \\"45,\\" Handwritten, Mae, National Anthem, Howl, Too Much Blood, and Mulholland Drive are some of the best GA songs to date.  And while admittedly, this album is no '59 Sound, let's be honest...nothing will ever be as good as The '59 Sound.  But this is always the case with the bands we love.  There is always that album that becomes the soundtrack to our life and how can a band possibly outdo it?  But this album comes close.  It feels even more thought out than American Slang (which I loved) and 3 things strike me the most ... 1) nobody sings like Brian Fallon; 2) Alex is playing some excellent solos; 3) when a song has a chorus with only the word \\"Hey\\" in it (Howl) and the song is great, then that tells how good the band is :)<br /><br />To end this review, I love how GA has expanded on their perfect sound.  There are touches of Springsteen still, touches of The Clash still, and touches of Tom Petty (with a great cover of You Got Lucky), but all the while, this is The Gaslight Anthem.  And for me, they are amazing (on every CD and live) and they are the best band around.hey are the best band around.

1400079276|1.0|This was the absolute worst and most bland and boring book I have ever read. It seemed like he had a bunch of mystical and interesting ideas, and he just jammed them all together. The storyline was an excuse for him to share a couple of his pretty much entirely unrelated thoughts. 90% of the story was useless, and unexplained. Most of the novel actually had no purpose at all, and he was rambling for two thirds of it. There were even characters that were useless. At points he would go into great detail where I thought it was important to pay attention, but then he'd just drop the subject and move on with the \\"story\\". I am extremely frustrated with how the novel ends, and everything is left open. He writes with feeling, and the only feeling I got was that I was missing something. He made it seem like something was resolved, even though literally nothing was put together after all the damn pages I read. Nothing was resolved, it was boring most of the time and was for sure the hardest book to continue reading. The only reason I finished it was for a friend really.
1934030554|5.0|A very well written book containing as much technical detail as one would like. That being said it is still very easy to read and understand.
0307387178|5.0|This book is really great.  I was not disappointed with it in any way.  It is a somewhat sad story in that McCandells dies, but I believe the old saying that life is not lost at death, but rather it is lost each day that we don't really live while we are alive.  In that way I believe McCandells lived way more than most of us ever will.  Somehow a book like this makes me want to forsake all the security and frills of career and home and turn my back on it forever, and for once live free however dire the consequences may be.
0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman is a noble laureate who lives up to this well deserved reputation as a clear thinking, insightful economist. This book cuts through the politics to focus on the what, why, and how of our current economic plight and the means to rectify our situation. This is a must read for any serious minded person--liberal or conservative. In order to fix problems, one must begin with a clear view of the problem--devoid of political dogma. Paul provides it here. We can do better as a nation. Read, learn and begin....

B0052RDHTM|3.0|If you are about to get on a very long flight, this book is a fantastic companion. Like all of Follett's books, it is a compelling read that is very hard to put down. And yet, it is hard not to have a sense of a missed opportunity. Reading this book, you feel that Follett is trying to create an epic, something like Herman Wouk's War and Remembrance and if that is the case, this book falls short. Reviewers have written about the unlikely plot turns that bring the same small set of characters together again and again in the most improbable circumstances - plot turns that add nothing to the story and only diminish its verisimilitude and they are right. But in my mind, this book's biggest sin is a sin of omission - other than one brief mention of no consequence, there is no note of the Spanish Flu of 1918, the world's worst epidemic after the Plague of the 14th century, an epidemic that actually killed more people than World War I. In the book's more than 800 pages there is enough fat to cut to make room for one of the biggest calamities in a century notorious for its tragedies.<br /><br />And a pet peeve - Mr. Follett: if you are going to use unusual vocabulary, use it sensibly. As an example, Follett puts the uncommon adjective \\"milquetoast\\" in a description associated with a barely literate character (anything wrong with \\"timid\\"?). In doing so, he is also causing a temporal anomaly - the word is based on cartoon character invented in the early 1920s, a few years after the scene described in the book...

0060920084|4.0|This book was really fun to read.  Although I didn't find it to be the gut-busting funny that several people apparently do, I did find myself humorously amused throughout most of the reading.  One thing is for sure, and that is that Bryson sees American people the way that they really are.  I didn't find him to be as condescending as some reviewers did, but rather he seemed to be admitting that he's no better but still finds our ignorance, apathy, laziness, obesity, etc., annoying.  It is really great to have unbiased eyes looking at our ways of life and perhaps causing us to consider doing better.  I was hoping to learn a bit more about the places he visited, but that aspect is simply absent.  This is not an eloquent travel journal.  Instead it is Bryson's rant about how he perceives the people he meets during his travels.  With that being said, he has pretty good perception, and his rants are totally amusing.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book, and cannot believe it was rated so highly. The story is odd, the characters are odd, and it has a very odd ending. I know 3 other people who read this book and didn't like it either. I have seen the author on all the talk shows promoting her book, and hear all the ooo's and aaaws, but this book is strange.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Thank you for getting these books to me so quickly.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all three books.  I laughed, I cried.  It was so easy to get involved in Christen's and Anitasia's life.

I highly recommend them as a fantastic read with a really great story, oh and as for the soft porn my hubby loved the benefits he received.

B006ZS7ZLS|5.0|I'll be honest.  I only picked up this album because it was $.99 during a promotion.  Outside of the terrible SNL performance, I had no idea who Lana Del Rey was.  I'm glad that my $.99 impulse gene triggered since I truly enjoy the album and have found myself playing it back to back...to back.  For those who first became aware of her and tuned out after her SNL performance, you definitely need to scratch that performance from your memory banks and simply get this album.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the book!! Couldn't put it down! The husband was sure happy I was reading it, If you know what I mean ;). The only bad part was the ending, it ended right in the middle! There has been a lot of controversy over this book and I can see why, but I feel like it wasn't as awful as everyone made it out to be. I would recommend it over and over again

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|but watch out, other people may take it over. I played through half of the game when my girlfriend decided to take a crack at it and finish the rest of it as quickly as possible. Not only did she take over the game, but she took over my tablet. She was hooked almost immediately, I had to pillow fight her to get it back. If you like looking for random objects and paranormal stories, this is a good game to play.

B0024CEY36|4.0|Ken Follett has the ability to take a turning point in history and make it come alive in a work of fiction. In \\"The Man from St. Petersburg\\" he has done just this. Taking a slice of life of the British aristocracy and showing the conflicts that leads up to WWI.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What a wild and very realistic ride we have been taken on.  The connection at the end could have been more developed. But if you think that this story is at all like the love triangle in Twilight.  Then you've missed the story entirely.  And the ending wont be sufficent.  Powerful, jaw dropping, intellectual writing.  Definitely a thinkers novel. Bravo!<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />I'm sure that many will disagree but, for the most part the last book was the best way to end a sick and twisted story about a government twisted enough to send children in to fight to the death for entertainment.  I love the comparison to the Roman Empire with the expression Bread And Circuses.  This completely the modern version of it.  But what had me pacing the kitchen floor talking to myself was the realization of something that I think most reviewers have over looked.  The story was never really centered around her emotions for either Peeta or Gale.  The roller coaster starts because she made a promise to her little sister that she was safe.  Only moments later to be selected for the games. Sure Peeta is there and has his role.  But the whole reason she even recognizes him going into the games is because he gave her the bread that gave her hope to hunt and save her family.  Gale is just an extention of that.  He helped keep her family safe.  Which makes since that he leaves after he tells Katniss that he basically failed her by not protecting Prim.  Her decisions are always based on Prim and Mom.  Peeta realizes this and makes the locket.  Her owning him for inspiring her to fight for her family and hunt, is what causes her to even fall in love with him in book 1.  She doesn't admitted it until 2 but, it's there.  So Prim's demise and Katniss' decision to kill the president leading her to catatonic make since.  She feels empty because the one person she vowed would be able to have a brighter future is gone.  Peeta and the epilogue are like consolation prizes or a bronze metal match.  Her main goal her main focus all series, failed.  A

B004BSFSTA|1.0|I can give a lengthy review on the audio quality of these but, many have already done so and they are fair reviews... I got about what I expected in audio quality.. perhaps a bit less.<br /><br />However the build quality is my big issue, I have handled many Marshall amps in the day and I have little or actually no remembrance of them coming to pieces or there build quality ever coming into question.  These headphones however have had pretty gentle use as far as I'm concerned and today after about 9 months or so of use on a not so often basis.. that is to say not even once a week and a couple issues along the way like the Marshall emblem falling off and the easy bending of the wire like attachment to the earpiece from the band......  they fell to pieces in my hands... yes that is right they fell to pieces in my hands today the plastics holding together the wire and the band has just fallen completely apart and unfortunately even a very handy fix it guy like me has found it beyond repair.  I'm very disappointed... I didn't expect a studio pair of headphones, just an average pair that might perform well enough over a few delightful years, of the over 10 pair of \\"reasonable\\" headphones I have bought this pair comes in at the absolute bottom.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|I LIKED IT.  A STRANGE BUT COMPELLING, TRUE-TO-LIFE DRAMA, WITH JUST A LITTLE DARK COMEDY THROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE.  IT EXPLORES ONE FAMILIES INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONAL REACTIONS AFTER BEING CONFRONTED WITH INFIDELITY OF THE MOTHER, ONCE SHE HAS AN ACCIDENT LEAVING HER BRAIN DEAD. THE MORAL DECISIONS THEY FACE AS A RESULT OF THIS AND THE EMOTIONAL GROWTH THEY SHOWED IN STRUGGLING TO FIND IT WITHIN THEMSELVES TO HAVE FORGIVE HER IS WHAT MADE THE MOVIE FOR ME. THE KIDS WHO ACTED IN THIS PICTURE WERE ALL THREE GREAT- GEORGE C., TOO.  WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT.  GOOD PICTURE, BUT NOT FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR LIGHT ENTERTAINMENT.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Wow.  The first thing that comes to mind is just, wow.  I admire the realism the author uses to describe a quick witted young woman that seams unbreakable, after the games.  What I think mmany other negative reviewers miss is that Susan Collins isn't wring a super hero novel.  The characters aren't mutants or vampires that heal with incredible speed.  These are just normal people, set in a scene and under pressures most of us deem unthinkable.  So Katniss' reaction to her new world is quite understandable.  She's just an execptionally skilled Olympian, if you will, that has survived mutilating horrors.  Not like a solider going in to defined a nation, or even win, but die in the place of her sister.<br /><br /> My only problem is the ending.  But even then still a decent way to set up for the \\"final games\\".  I appreciate the flashbacks in the book.  It keeps the story real and therefore engaging.  We are called to remember with Katniss as she enters in to areas or touches things that enduce either joy or nightmarish pain.  We get to feel her struggle with what is real and the show.  Where she wants to be and if it is even possible to be normal again.  Plus, for thoses of us that weren't as lucky to read the books back to back it helps us keep up with the storyline.<br /><br /> SPOILER: she gets thrown back into the arena to face more horrors and discover that the entire time she has been a pawn in a greater scheme.  Her entire world not flipped up side down but shattered, repaired and then shattered into tiny pieces again.  I mean just as she is getting used to being with Peeta, she loses him.  War breaks out and all she was trying to do was take a place when a boy and some berries got in the way.<br /><br />SUSAN COLLINS you are an execptional writer.  Even with the minor grammatical errors, the story was captivacting and so good I finished the last to books in 3 days.  I only hope the movies do you justice.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Loved the movie.  The action scenes and the over the topness, were great!  Just wish we had gone to see this on the big screen in iMax, that would be so worth it.  Hope you enjoy it too.  Plus, the little funnies that Simon Pegg drops too. :-)
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|So the new Linkin Park album is out. This album has been hyped a lot. With a smash hit first single, super-producer Rick Rubin on the job, and a huge rift in the reviews, this album has a lot of hype around it. The reviews on iTunes were saying that it was a return to sound, and music bloggers were saying it was laughably terrible. So I decided to listen myself, as I am a fan of ALL of Linkin Park's previous albums. Hybrid and Meteora are obviously awesome, Minutes wasn't too much of a drastic change in my opinion and it was pretty good, and A Thousand Suns was very different and artistic. So then we have LIVING THINGS. (just a side note, I thought it was extremely obnoxious and irritating that they felt the need to capitilize the album and all the tracks. I feel like they're shouting the song titles at me when I check them on my iPod.)<br /><br />To the people who say it's a return to their Hybrid/Meteora sound, it's not. Not even close. Hybrid and Meteora were albums that consisted of rapped verses, heavy nu metal guitars, melodic clean sung choruses with some screaming, and very metal-reminiscent screamed bridges and breakdowns. This album is pretty much an electronica/alternative rock album. There are guitars, but I can barely hear them through all the computerized electronica.(Keep in mind I am a fan of all musical genres, including electronica. Not hating on the genre at all.) There is more screaming than previous efforts and a return to the rapped verses/sung chorus/screamed bridge format on some of the tracks, but you could hardly call it a return to Hybrid Theory because of all the electronic elements. The only song that sounds like Hybrid is VICTIMIZED. (I wish that song was longer, it's awesome. You think it's really gonna take off and become a very satisfying track, but then it just ends. Disappionting.) However, do not assume that I think that using electronica is a bad idea in theory. Experimentation is something Linkin Park does very well. Adding electronic elements could be very cool. However, on this album, it's not.<br /><br /> The whole album is unique to any of their other albums, but not in a good way. The songs themselves are decent enough, but I can't enjoy the majority of them because they are all just LATHERED in this cheesy radio-accesible sounding electronica. It's something they've never really done in this way and to this extent before, and I'm definitely not a fan of it. The song structures and vocal styles definitely remind me of Hybrid and Meteora, but the music does not. It comes across very cheesy, mainly due to the electronica. (sorry I keep going back to that, but it's the thing about this album that I noticed the most, and I did not like it at all. I'm very surprised that most other reviewers have failed to mention the sheer amount of it. I don't know how anyone can say this album sounds like Hybrid solely because of it.)<br /><br />I would also like to talk about the lyrics a bit. They are angry and angsty. Like Hybrid Theory! However, at this point, after the conceptual lyrics of A Thousand Suns, and 10 years after the red spikey hair, mad at the world, \\"shut up when I'm talking to you!!!!!\\" youngster days of Hybrid Theory, it sounds silly. With ATS, it sounded like they wanted to stop writing angsty lyrics, so this one sounds forced. Really all the elements that resembled Hybrid sound like a forced attempt to please the old school LP fans(lyrics, predictable song structures). However, not all the lyrics are bad. Some of them are different, and a lot nicer. (ROADS UNTRAVELED, POWERLESS)<br /><br />In conclusion, this album is neither a return to their roots nor another experimental project like a Thousand Suns. This album sounds like Linkin Park attempted to go back to their original sound to please the ones who hated Minutes and Suns, appeal to commercial radio, and experiment all at the same time. However, the electronica ruins the first, and the second ruins the third. It's like they didn't want to experiment too much because it would displease the old school fans, but they didn't want to fully embrace their old sound because it would be too heavy for radio. SO they think they can solve this problem with electronica. Radio accesible, and it's different, so it's experimental! But it doesn't work. They're trying to please everybody, but all the elements that they use to try to accomplish this near impossible feat end up contradicting themselves and making the album sound messy. All in all, it's not terrible, but it's not very good either. Only a few tracks really impressed me. 2/5

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am an adult who read this book because my grandkids and some Sunday School kids were reading it.  (I didn't assign it.  They were reading it anyway)  It held my interest and kept me turning pages.  I was entertained.  We got some good discussions from it.  Kids at church even gave a presentation for \\"kids time\\" from it on decision making.  I'd suggest being careful about who is reading it if the reading list is your choice. Sexual implications would be safely over the head of younger adolescents. It is mild and they no doubt have seen and heard worse.  Violence would be more my concern.  Children are being killed and killing each other in a bizarre pattern of oppression.  None of the kids had bad dreams or other concerns.  All of the kids enjoyed it.  All enjoyed it enough to go on and read the rest of the trilogy.  (So did I).
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The sex is actually quite mild and actually lessens as you go through the books.  I assume one reason it appeals to woman is because our heroine is very orgasmic.  She has mind blowing orgasms time after time.  But the real porn is money porn.  The guy is 28 or so, a billionaire, who flies her all over (family and friends too) to various homes, buys her expensive cars, etc.  At first she resists the money but finally gives in and starts to enjoy it.  What's a girl going to do?

0743297334|4.0|I've read Ernest Hemingway's THE SUN ALSO RISES a couple of times. After finishing The Paris Wife by Paula McLain my fellow book club members wanted to know more about Ernest and Hadley's life among the \\"Lost Generation,\\" so we agreed to read Hemingway's novel about that period to see if more details were available.  Yes, there are more details but no, they're not particularly interesting.<br /><br />THE SUN ALSO RISES was Hemingway's first successful book.  It's no secret that the hero, Jake Barnes, was Hemingway's portrayal of himself.  He never attempted to hide that or the identities of the friends he and Hadley consorted with as he depicted them in the book.  Several became ex-friends after the book was published.  Hadley, the love of his life for a while, was never even mentioned in the book although several other women had prominent parts in his narration.  Lady Brett was patterned after a woman who was prominent in Ernest and Hadley's life,  perhaps more prominent than Hadley suspected.  Hemingway eventually had the good sense to dedicate the novel to Hadley, realizing her displeasure at her omission.<br /><br />The book is a record of the meanderings of friends without much to do except ramble around, drink heavily, squabble with each other, eat a lot, and attend bull fights.  There's not much chicken on those bones.  It's a novel that comes across as stodgy and outdated, with the narrative somewhat unrealistic.  It's not likely that the worldly characters Hemingway portrays would eschew the use of profanity in real life, although I can't recall a single cuss word being spoken in the book, even during insults and the administration of drunken beatings.<br /><br />The question, therefore, is what has the book got going for it?  Most emphatically, one has to say, it's got Hemingway's nonpareil writing skills.  People aspiring to be writers can only drool at his ability to forego the use of adjectives while implanting a vivid scene in his readers' minds.  As an example, I offer Hemingway's description of arriving at Pamplona by car:  \\"...there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind.\\"<br /><br />As a reader, one forges ahead breathlessly through mundane plot and archaic conversation to delight in spare and magnificent word craft.  And so it is with most of Hemingway's works.  What they lack in plausibility and timeliness is more than made up for in the utility and beauty of their prose.<br /><br />Schuyler T Wallace<br />Author of TIN LIZARD TALES
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this is a great book. much better than the movie.you must read this before seeing the movie or you will be completly lost in the movie. read the other 2 boooks that follow. they are wonderful also.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Young adult fiction is some of the most powerful and original out there. However, I do not consider this book to fit solely in that realm. It is powerful and original, absolutely --- but I think that it is being considered young adult based solely on the age of the protagonists. This book is universally appealing. It maneuvers through the heavy topics of terminal cancer and eventual death with a realistic wit and strength. The execution of words combined with compelling characters will not allow you to put the book down. And yes, you will weep. You should weep. But in the end you will be rewarded with something real, raw and rare for your effort. Highly recommend it.
0307913090|1.0|I had read that the author was the American Tolkien, so I bought the audio book, looking forward to becoming immersed in another world. This comparison couldn't be further from the truth. Tolkien's writing captures the wonder, magic, and beauty of people and the world. Tolkien's descriptive prose fills your minds with images; his people and the world are multifaceted. In Martin's book, people are concerned with one thing: power over each other. There's nothing but mean people being mean to each other and teaching the naive how to be mean. The only magic is dark; there is no wonder; there is no careful description of the world or people to draw you into its reality.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're thinking about this book because you're a Tolkien fan, skip it.

B0084IG7KC|3.0|The premise is creative and had possibility; a government oppressive to the point of forcing its own citizens to die for entertainment, and to keep them utterly dependent and without power, only the illusion of \\"a little hope\\". Very Roman-esque, except that instead of gladiators or political prisoners, we have children doing the killing. Therein lies my biggest complaint against these books/movies. Children slaughtering each other in violent, ghastly, bloody, remorse-less ways. That alone renders these stories inappropriate in my view, especially considering these are marketed to children as readers. Beyond that, I just can't swallow the idea that the people would be so mindlessly accepting of this. Sure, they sulk and brood and mutter against it, but in the end, they just go along with it. Sure honey, go on and kill your friends, make sure your dress is pretty when you get selected. I mean... really?? It's just too far-fetched to be plausible to me, and that ruined it in the end. The movie had some good acting, it kept to the book well, but it dragged a lot (of course, the book drags even more), and in the end, you don't feel hopeful or eager for the next chapter in the story; you feel absolutely depressed at the countless corpses of children (as young as 12 years old, for crying out loud) who have brutally slaughtered each other.
0307279189|5.0|As a non-athlete, I thought this story and the many stories behind the story were wonderful and compelling. The book just got better and better.

B0089J270U|3.0|The reason I am reviewing this product is because all the present reviews shown are for this movie in standard DVD format. Yesterday, I bought the Blue-ray format version at Walmart for $9.96. I did not own this movie on standard DVD format, so expected a better quality picture and sound in this formate. I played it on a Panasonic Blue-ray player produced in 2011. This player has played my other blueray disks very! When I loaded the blueray version of this movie it loaded slowly and when the menu finely loaded the picture and sound quality and was poor. There was a warning that I may have difficulty loading this movie.  I did have problems loading the movie and using the movie's menue. I am going to attempt to load the movie again and read the warning again and see if their is firmway update for my blue-ray player to help me with this movie loading. If so I will update this review. Please hold up on purchasing this blue ray version until their are some more review listings of the blue ray versions provided by people purchasing the blue ray version.
B006OB3K56|5.0|To all of the actors we've been introduced to over the past few years, two that have made a significant impression have been Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan. After seeing Fassbender in more commercial films like 300 and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, he made quite an impression, and after seeing Mulligan in AN EDUCATION, I was totally taken with her talent and charm. Then I saw and was absolutely stunned by Fassbender's performance in HUNGER (directed by this film's director Steve McQueen), based on a true story of an Irish political prisoner who goes on a hunger strike. It was an amazing performance and probably one of the most affecting performances of recent years. Also continuing to shine was Mulligan in films like the haunting and underrated NEVER LET ME GO and my personal pick of best film of 2011, DRIVE.<br /><br />But SHAME is a showcase for both of these great actors in incredibly bare (both figuratively and literally) and incredibly powerful performances.<br /><br />Fassbender plays Brandon, a young professional in New York City. He is also a sex addict, and while some people play around with the idea of defining Brandon as such, it is absolute. He cannot function throughout the day without different sexual acts, liasons, and exposure to sexual input, and the level of danger that it can represent is of little consequence to him; It's the same as being a drug addict or an alcoholic. Then comes along Sissy (Mulligan), Brandon's less responsible and emotionally unstable sister as she invades his apartment and his life. She is an addict of a different sort; she craves love and attention and affection, and Brandon, being who he is, seems incapable of giving something of what she wants to her.<br /><br />Fassbender plays Brandon as something of a predator; riding the subway, he scans the different people and finds a beautiful woman who smiles at him, but he never smiles back. He looks as her as if she's a meal or a fix; something to sate his neverending appetite, and when she gets off the train, he pursues her in a very unsettling way. He is also emotionally empty inside and realizes it. He's not a sociopath; he just uses sex to express all of his feelings and to fill the emptiness inside him. The closer he gets to someone emotionally, the more sexual encounters he requires, and this builds to a crescendo of self-punishment and more extreme sexual acts when he and Sissy have a massive fight about their meaning to one another. Mulligan plays Sissy as someone who is desperate for attention and affection, but in a more playful manner than Brandon's predatory persona. She may initially appear as quirky and free-spirited, but is as equally self-destructive, seeking affection in places she knows she can't get them.<br /><br />McQueen, who also directed the marvelous and extremely unsettling HUNGER directs this film with the same level of attention to detail and with the same verve of the construction of a scene. He also knows how to direct a scene that is so incredibly tense yet be somewhat innocent at the same time and this is best displayed with two scenes: the scene where Brandon discovers Sissy in his apartment in his shower fully nude and his eyes linger perhaps a little too long at her and yet she allows it rather than covering up with the towel immediately, suggesting there may have been something in their past that has been more than familial; also the scene in which Sissy sings a very torch-song rendition of \\"New York, New York\\", and the camera is close in on her face for most of the song, but cuts back to Fassbender, in obvious distress.<br /><br />This film arguably doesn't require the NC-17 rating aside from the casual male nudity and a few very brief moments of graphic imagery, especially since other NC-17 or Unrated releases within recent memory have featured full, unsimulated sex, like many of the films of Catherine Brelliat, John Cameron Mitchell's brilliant SHORTBUS, or Michael Winterbottom's 9 SONGS, but this filmactually wears that rating like a badge of honor. The sex and nudity within this film is certainly not meant to tittilate or excite or even to shock. It is there because it's a vital part of the story of this character. It's there because in order for us to understand, we have to experience on something of a similar and visceral level, and this film could honestly not exist without it. The sex and nudity of the film is not nearly as controversial as the actual subject matter is, and it doubtless will offend people, but the people it would offend really shouldn't be watching this film anyway.<br /><br />Both Fassbender (who is arguably the hardest working actor in film over the last two years, and he's been the highlight of just about all of the films he's been in) and Mulligan give extraordinary performances, but it's without a doubt Fassbender's film. And it's a testament to the performers' courage to be actors known for their magnetism (no pun intended for Fassbender) and charisma to allow them to be shown at their least charismatic.<br /><br />SHAME is a challenging, intelligent, and at times a terrifying film, and it's absolutely not a piece of art that anyone involved should be ashamed of.actually wears that rating like a badge of honor.

B006PTL1GC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Cronenberg and have been since VIDEODROME, and I'm really appreciating the filmmaker he's grown into. He refused to pigeon-hole himself into just making hyper-violent or horrifically unnerving psuedo-sexual horror or suspense films; with SPIDER and A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, he started entering the world of a fully mature director who could now play with all the toys that cinema had to offer. After that, though, came his safest film EASTERN PROMISES, and other than a bravura performance by Viggo Mortensen, is a sadly forgettable film. But with A DANGEROUS METHOD, he subverts another genre of filmmaking: The Historical Biopic.<br /><br />Aside from the excellent (but unsurprisingly historically inaccurate) storytelling and great performances by Michael Fassbender as Carl Jung, Vincent Cassel as Otto Gross, and Viggo Mortensen as Sigmund Freud, the real standout here is Keira Knightley who gives a brilliant, uncompromising performance as Sabina Spielrein, the young woman who comes to Jung's hospital for treatment and is the catalyst for the drama within the film. Many people who are giving this film less than stellar reviews are singling out Knightley for \\"overacting\\" when she's in the throes of her hysteria. Obviously I wasn't there, but from historical documentarians and accounts, this is a very successful recreation of a woman suffering from hysteria. To be quite honest though, even if it wasn't an exacting duplication, it's utterly convincing, totally unflinching, and excruciatingly heartbreaking to watch. The most important part of a great performance is to not see the actor through the character they're playing, and when they disappear into a role, it's really breathtaking to witness. That's exactly what Knightley does with the role of Sabina; she doesn't just play her, she becomes her.<br /><br />I've been a great admirer for the most part of Knightley's roles of late now that she is unshackled from having to be the prissy quasi-adventurer of the terrible PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN series, and that can really be initially witnessed through her transformation into \\"Domino\\" Harvey in Tony Scott's DOMINO (a film worth seeing once, but not much more than that), and her stellar work in Mark Romanek's underrated and underseen NEVER LET ME GO. This is the performance I've been waiting for from her, and believe me it's well worth the wait.<br /><br />Cronenberg doesn't stray too far away from his favorite subject of sexuality and the modern mind/body, and he does extract some kink from what might otherwise be a beautifully acted and shot but all-too-safe biopic, and the sado-masochism this film displays does fit within the confines of this film and this subject matter. Mortensen shines as Freud, a man full of wisdom and bonhomie, but also a man filled with trepidation. Fassbender is fascinating as a Jung, the \\"son\\" to Freud's \\"father\\" of the field of psychoanalysis, and as a man who is of two minds about a great many things, but is steadfast in his belief that Freud's \\"talking cure\\" has to evolve. Cassel as Gross is hypnotic in his own twisted way as a early 20th-Century hippie; a practitioner of polygamy, a man who uses drugs to expand his consciousness; a man constantly in search of pleasure and looked to cure those who would deny themselves pleasure. Jung is the man caught between all of these characters; Freud, Gross and Spielrein... all of them seem to pull him in different directions, but all of them help to shape the man he would become.<br /><br />A DANGEROUS METHOD is more than just a story about two of the most significant minds of the 20th Century and the woman that would come between them; it's about the first ripple of a movement that would change everything in the world to come, and Cronenberg does this ripple great justice.terrible PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN series, and that can really be initially witnessed through her transformation into \\"Domino\\" Harvey in Tony Scott's DOMINO (a film worth seeing once, but not much more than that), and her stellar work in Mark Romanek's underrated and underseen NEVER LET ME GO.

B00846REIS|4.0|okay, so everyone was making such a big deal about this book. I don't know. I feel that it was trying on many levels to compete with a certain trilogy that is big right now. Whether or not that is true, I don't know- but that's kinda how it came across to me.<br /><br />It's a NICE book though. I didn't think it was super hot or anything.
B00122BEPA|4.0|Although this compilation includes almost every essential Van Halen tune you would likely hear on the radio, there are some flaws. For whatever reason, the songs are not presented in chronological order, which really throws off the flow of the songs. The 3 songs recorded for this album are pretty good, but nothing too special to rave about. The inclusion of the live tracks is pretty redundant and would have served better to add 3 more different songs. The remastering however is great, especially for the Van Hagar tracks that were not remastered before(here's hoping that Warner Bros. remasters those 4 albums soon like they did for the Roth catalogue). If you are purchasing the MP3 album, please beware that Eruption and Panama intros are cut for some reason, not sure if the files are corrupted but since no previous review has mententioned it, it must be only on Amazon's MP3s. If you're new to Van Halen and want the best starting point for the right price or just a casual fan who wants all the hits you hear on the radio, this is the best bet, just beware of the download.

B0073XV2W2|5.0|Like his first two books, 'Kill Decision' is a non-stop edge-of-your-seat thrill jam. Suarez's grasp of bleeding-edge technology and modern warfare coupled with his ability to develop likable (and despicable) characters gives the reader a great read. His story development and his ability to shock and surprise the reader often comes into play. Our story begins with a series of mysterious airborne drone attacks that appear to be the work of the US military - except the US military has no knowledge of the attacks. The attacks soon become very menacing: swarming autonomous drones that communicate with one another to coordinate their attacks - a frightening development that involves a young scientist who studies the habits of Weaver ants. A group of Special Operations warriors - along with a handful of 'volunteers' - combine forces in an effort to learn who is behind these attacks, and to stop them. They are stymied at every turn and the mystery deepens as they try to figure out how their enemy seems to know their every step in advance. I look forward to Suarez's next book - hope my wait is a short one. This guy is one of the top techno-thriller authors out there. 'Kill Decision' would make one hell of a film. I hope Hollywood is paying attention.

This book was pretty quick to get through, but was packed with thoughtful analysis of the idea that success is totally up to the individual and has nothing to do with their circumstances.
B002VPE1X4|3.0|I ordered this item and the Sony LCS-CST, both pretty cheap cases for pocket cameras.  I much prefer the Sony case.

It is much better built and I would recommend that one over this one.

B004XQO8VO|3.0|back in the  1990's  wesley snipes was a big star and stallone was fading a bit. But still making a list movies. This was a high budget sci fi  movie that is one of the silliest movies of snipes career. although his career these days is straight to dvd films which are low budget. The film features stallone going after escaped cryogenically frozen criminals. Jeffery dahmer (the milwaukee cannibal who ate many young men) is even mentioned and he killed in prison right before this one came out.  However there are some of the silliest lines in history as sandra bullock has to say with a straight face to slys character , 'all the resteraunts are taco bells now!\\"  really?  taco bell must have financed this movie completely! lol. Anyways it is a over the top b movie type plot with alot of money to make it look great. (for autdiences in 1993 especially and that's what counts with older movies , not how they look to todays dvd watchers!). this is silly and is probably on many critics worst of lists. But I like cheesy movies alot so I say fans of cheese; this one is for you. the blu ray looks decent enough too.

Which was decent but came out the same week as titanic. Which sank this at the boxoffice!  The blu ray looks outstanding though. It isn't a terrible movie, but much more of a solid understandable plot was needed. At the time johnathon harris was still alive and he liked gary oldmans version of dr. smith. and it is a highlight of the movie.

I was very involved in the book and felt great sympathy for the character so it was enjoyable to see her come to life in the movie.  The actress did a good job of portraying her,but as are other Hunger Games fans, I am ready for the sequel, Catching Fire and the finale The Mocking Jay.  It just stopped in the middle as all trilogies do. I loved the movie, but as usual, I enjoyed the books more.

B005NLNSRI|5.0|Utterly odd and unique in the best way. Sweet, funny, breezy stop motion animation film based on the Roald Dahl novel.  It's always delightful,<br />and very well voice-acted by the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon.<br /><br />A fox/father decides to settle down, stop stealing chickens and become a  respectable newspaperman, but hitting a mid life crisis the part of<br />him that longs to steal birds can't be denied one last big heist,  which leads to ever more dire (and funnier) consequences.<br /><br />I liked the film on first viewing, but found I loved it on the second.  First, for film fans, or fans of Anderson's work, it's hysterical how he has<br />translated his personal style, both visual and character, to animation.  This looks and feels like his other films in a way that is by itself an<br />absolute crack-up.  But more important it turns out that Anderson and Dahl are a great mix, with Dahl's great imagination taking Anderson's<br />cock-eyed view of life, and expanding it to a broader canvas.  In the end, while populated by puppet animals, this is as human, touching<br />and funny as almost anything Anderson has done.  It may be too sophisticated for little kids, but any child advanced enough to enjoy Dahl's<br />books (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc.) should have a grand old time, along with their parents.<br /><br />While the Criterion is clearly the best release in terms of extras, the picture quality on the much cheaper standard release blu-ray is also excellent, so the cost factor is worth considering.  That said, I traded up to the Criterion, and was happy I did.

I was scrambling to gather the disney movies my daughter should see before a Disney trip- and you can't even rent TLM!!  Thank goodness for the secondary market!!  On the WDW note- one of the special features on this disc is the Imagineers version of the ride that never was- where they all talk sentimentally about how they wanted to make a ride based on this movie, and there is a virtual ride on disc 2.  Well, based on the drawings on WDW's website- I'm pretty sure it is the one they are building right now!!  The exterior certainly looks identical.  So it's kind of sweet to imagine that their dreams are being realized finally.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|This has been a terrific summer for movies! Every movie I've seen this summer I've loved. Snow White & the Huntsman, The Cabin in the Woods, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Avenges, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World... And of course The Hunger Games! This was by far the best movie I've see this summer! I mean where do I start? Everything from the Storylineto the acting.<br />  The book is very well written and I think the movie fallows it as closely as it can. In 2hrs and 22mins the movie fits in every important  plot piece and even though it leaves out some major \\"subplots\\" (Madge, the hovercrafts that collected the bodies in the arena, or the Avox girl) the movie still moves along very smoothly . The only part that I thought the movie hit a rough spot was in the cave. That part seemed very rushed through as in the book it took its own sweet time. Actually I think the cave part was way too long in the book but in the movie they just zoomed right through it. Even though it was sort of boring and slow paced, the cave is where Katniss and Peeta establish their relationship. In the movie we don't really get that they ACTUALLY like eachother, as far as someone who has never read the book knows, they are just continuing the charade of being in love. I deffinetly think their should have been a happy medium in the cave scene.<br />  As for the acting... It was spectacular. I think Jennifer Lawrence is deffinetly one to watch out for. He acting in X-Men: First Class was on the same level as it was in The Hunger Games. I think the script was a little bland but Lawrence deffinetly makes the bestow it and really brings the Katniss character to life.  And everyone else was very well casted! Woody Harrelson was terrific as Haymitch and Elizabeth Banks was THE PERFECT PERSON to play Effie. I think she stole the scene in every scene she was in.<br />  Overall The Hunger Games is a fun summer movie with great acting, good storyline, and good action. I would deffinetly recommendthis to anyone who asks about it.

B008MEM24S|5.0|My 7YO son begged me to buy this game. So of course, after buying it, I had to try it out first! This is actually more fun than the original &quot;Where's My Water,&quot; although we enjoyed that too. But we already know our favorite monotreme from his heroic exploits on our favorite tv show. Helping him out just makes it that much more fun!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I have downloaded this game on both my Thunderbolt and on my iPad. I have no problem playing on either. It is easier on the iPad but still just as fun on my phone.
B00104QSOM|5.0|While Paul Thomas Anderson has made great films before, he has come nowhere near There Will Be Blood. The film is a masterpiece, with incredible cast. Daniel-Day Lewis puts on a brilliant performance, as usual. As for the rest of the cast, they all seem to fit in pretty well even if they aren't notable actors/actresses. But it's the setting of the film that is very unique. This isn't necessarily a \\"western\\" themed film, but rather about the United States during the turn of the century era(1899-1900). But it definitely has the feel of a Western/Spaghetti western feel to it, even just from the setting of the film.<br /><br />If you are a cinephile and still haven't seen this, you definitely check it out. Probably one of the greatest modern American films yet.
1400069289|5.0|This is a terrific book. We are truly creatures of habit by design. I found the habit substitution model when I quit smoking. Every time I wanted a cigarette, I quickly popped in a piece of gum of a certain flavor/brand of gum I liked (non-nicotine). It was hard but after a few weeks my craving skipped over the cigarette and went straight for the gum. Not as easy as all that but the habit substitution (a new routine/reward) was a way out. Still smoke free though it took a number of tries for sure. Addiction and habit overlap, but are not the same thing really.<br /><br />The best thing about the book I almost missed and that was the short but terrific Appendix. This gave a great method of analyzing a habit and figuring a way to manage it via intelligent experimentation.<br /><br />Terrific Book that I think would help just about any one who put it in practice.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a fun game you are getting chased by monkeys and u get to by new charachters and upraged stuff and get faster and faster and its a awesome game u should get it and wen u get to the blue coins u go WICKED fast and I got all the characters!!!!!
B006RUJST6|5.0|At first this book scared me because the main characters are extremely young, and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to relate to them. But as I moved through the story, I realized that the age didn't matter because Ms. Hoover's portrayal of their love was undeniably pure and emotional. I read this book in one day because I couldn't put it down- I had a massage appointment in the afternoon and found myself reading my Kindle in the waiting room! If you are looking for a book that's about more than just romance, then look no further. This book has it ALL! It's funny, it's raw, and it's about life. I don't use the highlight function of my Kindle much, but I found myself catching a lot of advice from the characters here. Do yourself a favor and get this book!
1400069289|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The real life examples cited in conjunction with the theory really helped to give a clear cut presentation to illustrate the author's points.  I thought the first half of the book moved much quicker than the second.

0425263908|5.0|Of course, like many other readers have stated here, I read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and I was left coping with a surreal life afterward. I hate to admit that books affect me in such a way, but I really wasn't ready to put down that series yet and I needed something to fill the void. Insert \\"Bared to You\\" here. I read this book and not only did I get my erotic romance fix, but I actually enjoyed the characters in Ms. Day's story BETTER than in Fifty! I was initially a little worried that the book seemed to follow the same storyline as the aforementioned bestseller, but it quickly proves to move in a different direction and promises to keep its readers intrigued. I appreciate that Ms. Day was able to end the first book on a realistic note, yet keep the readers begging for more. I hope that this series goes beyond a trilogy so that we can show the author just how loyal we can be! I would love to push this book- and the pre-sale of the second book \\"Reflected in You\\"- to the top!
0439023491|3.0|The second novel in The Hunger Games series starts out with great promise, addressing questions that came up reading the first novel.  The inhumanity of the Capital versus the volume of people in the districts is a constant tension in the first novel.  This combined with the whole idea of the hunger games and the child tributes bring on the question of why there is no rebellion.  Catching Fire begins to answer this question when Collins falls back on the same old, same old of the games.  Halfway through the book she lost me.  The story can still be exciting, but it feels like a retread.  I am hoping book three covers some new territory.

0811729117|5.0|Simply put, Otto Carius is NOT a writer. I've seen more than a few complaints about the writing style, Otto Carius is NOT a writer. Tigers In The Mud was written originally for former soldiers of the 502ND as well as other German tankers. Taking this into account, it's a fantastic book. Carius does an amazing job of telling how he, and fellow members of the 502ND felt. He includes a few maps that go along with his story as well as a few photos of him, his crew and their surroundings; plus the addition of more than a few documents from Carius' time on the front (they're translated on the next page with a near identical document).

0525951652|1.0|Ken Follett's \\"Fall of Giants\\" is an excellent novel, one which I would otherwise recommend to anyone looking for an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Contrarily, and ultimately of more importance to me; Penguins pricing strategy for the book is dismal and utterly insulting.  At the time of the this review the Kindle edition of the book is priced at $18.99.  In contrast, the mass market paperback edition of the book is priced at $9.99.<br /><br />This is utterly ridiculous and amounts to predatory gouging on behalf of Penguin.<br /><br />Any 5th grader who takes his iPod earbuds out for 30 seconds can arrive at the simple conclusion that an E-book is significantly cheaper to produce and distribute than a physical book.  Printing, shipping, storage and handling costs are non-existent for a digital book.  Pricing the digital version of a book at nearly twice the price of the paperback version is simply insulting.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone interested in reading this book (and it is definitely worth reading!) borrow it from a friend or your local library.  Speak with your dollars and your reviews to convince authors to take a stand against ridiculous e-book pricing.
B007HNFREW|5.0|I won't go into detail about the story line but I will say that I enjoyed this season one DVD set a lot. HBO has hit another home run with a good series of the kind that always seems to keep them on top of the ratings. This series is every entertaining and the acting is just superb. It contains multiple characters that are carefully developed and you begin to support the character or hate them for their evil and manipulative ways. Each character seems so real and you feel empathy for their problems that they are going through.<br /><br />The show is high action and it contains multiple plots, heroes and villains. The suspense about what is on the other side of the wall is building and I cannot wait to see season two. With the threat of a fierce winter, dragons, white walkers, giants, the wild ones and giant wolves the kingdom is under threat. Can they stop fighting each other and unite to survive or are they their own worst enemy?<br /><br />This show features many outstanding actors and actresses who portray their characters to perfection. The film work is top notch and the scenery and special effects are outstanding. This is a first class saga and it is well worth the money to buy it and enjoy it.<br /><br />There is violence, sex, profanity and bloodshed in the story so make sure that you make note of that. The disks are unrated but they are probably for mature audiences only and they are at least an R rating.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this series to you, I really enjoyed them!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i spend every night staying up playing sooooooo late I still have bags under my eyes but there is 1 just one and only one reason that I don't like it and that's because the sound makes u have to pee really  badly besides that its AMAZING

0345803485|1.0|This book was a serious disappointment. I read in cosmo magazine that it was a very popular and highly reviewed romance novel. The actual story line between the main characters is interesting enough to keep you reading. The actual \\"romance\\" part of the book, for most, the sole reason to read the book, was ghastly. From the point of view from a completely inexperienced 20 something year old female who just happens to be highly susceptible to raging orgasms at the slightest start and no gag reflex? Honestly, trivial fantasies a male would appreciate or maybe a delusional tween virgin. Threw the book away upon completion.

0345803507|3.0|I can get over the fact that I spend 30 + dollars for the trilogy. I'm reading this one because I already purchase the books. Is a kinky love history with a naive girl, that gains guts after she marries the man of his life. Is an okay reading.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show, and the characters. Harvey is such a great guy, even though he likes to be a thorne in most peoples sides. But he does care, it's great how he and mike just seem to work.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is amazingly awesome! Do not listen to the poop heads who hats this game because they are wrong!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a great summer read! All of the reviews were so right. While it did drag on in parts it was a great page turner and really was worth the money!
0345803493|3.0|I love to read and to be honest I was expecting more from this book. Everyone is so exited about it and is not the best thing ever. The sex part is interesting in some cases is not a big deal. The first book is interesting, the second book is okay.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|There seemed to be some more plot twists in the second book, but I still feel as though there are a lot of unnecessary sex scenes that do little to enhance the story line. The plot is very similar to the Twilight series, but just a lot more risque.
B007SGM084|4.0|I totally enjoyed the book.  It was fun to read...quite predictable but if you like a quick read, it's great.  It is very racy but has a good storyline along the same as the Twilight series (for obvious reasons if you do your homework).
B002RI9VVM|5.0|This book is thoroughly enjoyable. Although it is only a short novel. You will fall in love with the characters and the story.
B008DR2GD6|5.0|We never care to count our own words. Do we? But the writer and director have shown us how do we mind our words when silence is golden and there is some cost attached to the words spoken even in anger, sorrow or happiness. I liked this movie not because of the cast or the laughter, but for the simple concept of silence and be controlled in all situations that change mercilessly. Eddie proves his talent once again in this movie and made me laugh aloud in some scenes Ex: the Starbucks - Extra Milk conversation.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and started thinking, what if god counts my good words and bad words and punish me as appropriate. Sounds funny and weird but again, this is just a thought!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The third and final book in this series finally had some real twists and turns. However, still laden with a lot of vulgarity. While I get that sex sells these days, I feel that it was still an overabundance and didn't enhance the story line at all. It got to the point where I wanted to just skip over those scenes and get back to the plot.
B004YM6JI2|3.0|I actually haven't seen this season yet but want to. I have loved the show from the very first episode that aired. I didn't enjoy season 6 as much and didn't like the finale. But I love the characters too much to stop watching. I agree and believed even back when the fifth season was airing that it should have been the last. The show should have ended when Kripke left. I really wish he would've stayed on but it should have ended then. As awesome as the the story line increases in drama and epicness, In all honesty I miss the first and second season style alot, more about random monsters and creatures ( a simpler time in the whole story). Though its probably impossible to go back to those times, It would be nice and If they could end the whole show on a happy note with everyone alive that would be fantanstic! But I know that won't happen.
B007549W62|1.0|When I first saw the preview for this movie, I had no idea what I was getting into. After watching this movie was thoroughly depresses and disturbed by the things id seen, no because of the content but because of how real the situations are. This movie forces you to face the harsh reality of the human mind and how fragile it is. You also have to sit through some of the most unsettling scenes that would make prisoners cringe but AGAIN they are very realistic and most likely will happen to people in that situation. I was particularly affected by the character Marilyn played by Rosanna Arquette. This character's child was taking from her for government experiments, she was raped constantly, she was beaten, and torture til her death and every scene was extremely vivid. I don't advice anyone with a soft heart, a feminist, or religious a person to watch this. BEWARE! But if you think you can handle it and you want a movie that make you think and can face to face with your morality, this is the film for you. I just wish I hadn't watched it, I cant get the gruesome scenes out of my head.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have really enjoyed this CD.  Adele has a sound all her own and the lyrics are just great on all the songs.  Took me a few times to understand each word as her English accent does come through at times.  But for me it is a great CD that I have listened to many time and will continue to listen to.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Background<br /><br />\\"Ponyo\\" is a movie created by Hayao Miyazaki. It was released first in Japan in 2008 and then in the United Stated in 2009. \\"Ponyo\\" is Miyazaki's 8th film released by Studio Ghibli. The first has been nominated for many awards and won some of them, including the Japanese Academy awards for Animation of the Year. It is a hand-drawn animation unlike many of the animations produced today by companies like Pixar. Also, the movie was inspired by Hans Christian Anderson's \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"<br /><br />Story-line<br /><br />\\"Ponyo\\" is magical. It is about a girl, Ponyo, and a little boy, Sosuke. Ponyo is a mermaid. Her mother is Goddess of the sea and her father, Fujimoto, is a wizard of the sea. Fujimoto was once human, which explains Ponyo's human characteristic. Ponyo runs away from home and washes up on shore. Sosuke finds her and keeps her as a pet. When Fujimoto finds Ponyo, he forces her back home. Ponyo then uses majic to turn herself into a human.  In order for her to remain human Sosuke must fall in love with her.<br /><br />What do I think?<br /><br />Overall, I think Ponyo was an execellent movie. It was very alive and very captivating! I have seen many of Miyazaki's other movies such as \\"Princess Mononoke,\\" \\"My Neighbor Totoro,\\" \\"Spirited Away,\\" \\"Kiki's Delivery Service,\\" and \\"Howl's Moving Castle.\\" All of these movies were to my liking. They all incorporate some form of magic! That and the animation, I believe, helps keep the viewer captivated.<br /><br />However, I did think that for this to be specifically a children's movie some parts of it were a little vague. Like in the beginning, even as an adult, I didn't understand much of what was going on. It took me a little while to catch on. As an adult, I was looking for more lead-ins and more background information on Ponyo and her family, even on Sosuke and his family. Also, the main characters were 5-year olds. They are not qualified to make a decision about love. Not yet. Atleast the little mermaid was a teenager! Other than that I had no problems with it. I am trying to keep in mind that I am viewing through the eyes of an adult, but even through the adult lenses I remained captivated, and I believe a child will too. My three year old children enjoyed it, just the same!

B0006ZE7G2|5.0|THE WALL has been one of the best visuals in INTRO TO SOCIOLOGY to explain the four agents of socialization, i.e., the importance of 1) family, 2) peers, 3) the educational system, and 4) media. If there is permission for public showing, the movie is a feast not just for the eyes (and a real surprise for, e.g., animation majors), but also connects musically, i.e., who - even among 20-odd year olds - has not hummed along to:  \\"We don't need no education ..\\"?  When we try to explain in Sociology how powerful agents of socialization are in one's life, either the entire movie, or specific scenes, can serve as a tool to apply abstract materials to students' lives.
B008FH6SUQ|5.0|I have listened to Fortune and have really enjoyed it.  I have the edited-version which contains virtually no profanity, but does contain some explicit sexual content, so parents be warned.  Vocally, I was impressed.  Musically, Fortune is an off shoot of today's music which is heavily auto-tuned, but I can listen to the album in its entirety, with the exception of Till I Die, straight through.<br /><br />The ballads are incredible!  Stuck on Stupid, 4 Years Old, Free Run and Don't Judge Me are instant favorites and are not traditional R&B.  I liked that he somewhat mixed genres of music and went back to his fan-base with his singing.  Trumpet Lights and Mirage w/Nas are also really good.<br /><br />Controversy aside, I feel like the album and Chris Brown deserved a second chance.  There are negative reviews out there. Some of those folks are just trying to make a name for themselves by saying something that will be the next big headline, but you should judge the MUSIC for yourself.
034580404X|4.0|As a keen book reader I must say I have enjoyed reading this trilogy (currently on the book no 3). It's no literary gem, I have to say that there are many other fiction authors with smoother and more eloquent language. The qualities are, first, a lot of explicit scenes but they are not vulgar, second, finally some positive outlooks on the male female relationships. If they gave us this instead of Smart women foolish choices (the Bible of the Eighties)maybe we women would be less angry over our men.. Joking a bit, but the books refreshed my summer days.
B007XF0X6G|5.0|Good movie for a bit of escapism, 3D effects enhance the enjoyment, as good as the first with a good storyline and lots of eye candy with the excellent CGI.<br />Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good action movie

0385344228|5.0|I love good legal thrillers and this is a great one!<br /><br />As assistant district attorney Andy Barber investigates the murder of a 15 year-old boy, he is stunned to be pulled from the case when his own son, Jacob, is accused of the crime.  Andy Barber is a respected member of the community who has spent a lifetime prosecuting criminals so of course his son must be innocent.  Or is he?<br /><br />This book is an intriguing page turner that often leaves the reader to wonder what the real truth is and how the evidence should be interpreted.<br /><br />Terrific read with a stunning ending.  This is a book that keeps you thinking long after the last page is turned!
B004LWZW6U|1.0|what is there to say the first one was pretty good this one is disasterous  all this movie is is the utmost cheesiest worst acting softcore film ever
044655667X|4.0|I confess.  I did something I never (okay, almost never) do.  I read this book without reading the first books in the series.  And I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Mickey Haller has decided to take advantage of the foreclosure epidemic by representing clients against the banks.  But when one of his clients is accused of murdering a loan officer at the bank threatening to take her home, he finds himself defending her against a first degree murder charge.  The evidence doesn't look good and Mickey seems to be grasping at straws until his strawn man alternative suspect begins to look genuinely guilty.<br /><br />I love the peek behind the scenes of the defense strategy, but the real attraction here is the likeability of the main character and his complex relationships with others (including two ex-wives, a difficult client, a junior associate, and a teenaged daughter).<br /><br />I liked it so much that I look forward to going back and reading the first books in the series!
B00846REIS|4.0|I have read and love 50 Shades of Grey, which is what got me to read this book. Thougth the story line is simalir, they are different in a lot of ways. Their is more of a story line between these two then in the first 50 shades book and things dont seem to move at the crazy fast pace that 50 shades does. I am interesed to see how these character develop as the serie contiunes. The sex scenee are hot but dont have the same raw feel as the ones in 50 shades dose but these are more believable to happen in real life then the ones in 50 shades. I am looking forward to the next book to see how things heat up between Eva and Gideon. I think this couple has just gotten started :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this app, it's better than the other solitaire applications I have tried. The graphics are great, smooth gameplay, just quality overall.
B008645YEE|3.0|This album is missing something: James Newton Howard. Were there scheduling conflicts or something? I love HZ's work, but it lacks Howard's touch that is so apparent in the earlier scores. Still, it's not bad. Selina's theme is really delightful, but it makes me wonder, since Howard put some of the light into Gotham through Harvey's themes, what could have happened had he been a part of this.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is still fun but I constantly have to upgrade my character and I don't think it will ever be caught by those monkey things. but I don't think I will ever stop playing it!
0345803485|1.0|Possibly the worst trilogy I have ever had the misfortune to read. I never thought I would be bored by an erotic thriller , but please!  I actually found myself skim reading the sex scenes just to get to the 'story'.  And when I say 'story', I struggled to find anything worth tuning in for. If you strip away the lip biting and vomit-inducing banter the pair exchange, you have a very poor, ill-thoughtout plot that James seems to make up as she goes along. The  language  is dull and uninspired.  I lost count of how many times Ana and Christian 'smirked' or 'whispered'  The sex scenes are repetitive and damn right ridiculous. I understand that there is a strong sexual chemistry between the characters, but Ana can orgasm on demand!  Christian's character is more scary than sexy.  He seems obsessed with making Ana eat and is continually stating, 'you're mine'. Run Ana, run!!  Sex seems to used as a method of shutting Ana up whenever her character attempts to grow a backbone.<br /><br />I just hope James doesn't write any more of this garbage.

Yes, i'm a man & any women / girl who doesn't like / love these books, well, she must be VERY PRUDISH & have No Imagination whatsoever ! Personally, i would NOT want to date a woman who didn't love these books, she would be about as alive as a piece of driftwood i believe. This Mrs. James, WOW ! What A Lady & writer, PLEASE Keep Them Coming, can't WAIT for your next book/books !<br />Ladies, read these books & get hubby to read them also.<br />Waiting To Exhale.

0307592731|5.0|Haven't read the book yet but it arrived in great condition and on time.  The reviews make me excited about reading it.  It is \\"in line\\".
1439153663|5.0|Because the book alternates in viewpoint between characters, it gives a full and rounded picture of the events. Some of the descriptions are almost lyric, and some are disturbing at best. Well written and full of emotion, it's a perfect book for a rainy weekend.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I was late coming to breaking Bad. I watched the first three seasons in a weekend marathon on Netflix. I could not wait, I had to see what happened in season 4, so I bought it. It did not dissappoint. Highly recommended. Can't wait for season 5, since Dish dropped AMC from their programming and I don't get to see it.

B007C1ZGV8|5.0|Oh my what a trip into the past this was. I read this book several times as a child. In fact, I was about Francie's age when I first read it. My only memory was of a girl in a window and a tree. For some reason that image stayed with me more than the story.<br /><br />I can't say that the story came back to me as I read, it did not. This was good, in that it was like reading and discovering it all over again. No wonder I read it time after time. In so many ways my own life mirrored Francie's.<br />Even to the picking up of trash ( bottles) along the roads ( alleys) and turning them in for money for treats.<br /><br />We, too were less than wealthy, but such is life. Better times came for us. As for Francie? Life is what you make it, don't you think? And Francie was a strong young girl, who grew into a strong and intelligent young woman. She came form a family of strong women, who knew how to keep family together and how to do whatever needed to be done. The poor can't afford much, and being squeamish is one of those things.<br /><br />I'd like to lift a glass to the Francie the woman, and the women around her who taught her how to be the best she could be. We can overcome a lot if we put our minds to it. This story was dated in some ways, but oh so current in others. After all these years there are still children who don't know where their next meal will come from, men who just don't have it in them to stand strong and do what is needed and women who make up the difference and stand with their shoulders against the door to keep out the wolf called hunger and keep in the warm called love.<br /><br />highly recommended.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|game wont open RIGHT AFTER buying smurfberrys. they should fix the game before letting people spend real money. i will be getting a refund. this is crazy how so many people this has happened to and its still aloud to go on. dont waste your time or MONEY.
B000003NA3|5.0|I like the selections of music that Coltrane brings to this series of CD's/performances. If I only had this Coltrane release and no others I could think I had a complete view of his work. That is not to say this is a complete collection it is not. It is a rich example of Coltrane's styles and performances. There are too many excellent albums to limit you listening to just this one.The live performance brings the listener a feeling of being there. Recommended to others

1468161660|3.0|Slammed was boring...I really cannot pin point what was lacking in the book. It just was average in my opinion. I normally reread books, but I know I will probably never reread this book!
0765322889|5.0|As a fantasy writer I found this novel very inspiring, even within the first 100 pages. Steven Erikson so far as inspired me more than any other author ever has which is saying a lot since I've read quite a bit of fantasy. It's pretty hard to compare him to anybody; he is so different, not just his complex ideas, but also his style which I am borrowing from a little bit. He has a lot of great ideas, most authors, even the good ones pale in comparison to his creativity. He has created his own fully fleshed out mythology with this series, and it truly astounds me how difficult it must have been for him to write. World building is probably the strongest aspect of this series.<br /><br />I understand why the ambiguity of this series might be a turn off for some people, especially at the beginning because he thrusts the reader into the middle of an ongoing story that they aren't familiar with instead of at the beginning of the story as would be conventional, and Erikson is anything but conventional which is one of the aspects I like most about his writing, being an unconventional writer myself. Why should a writer restrict himself to conventions, if only to sell more and attract a wider audience, but that's not what true art is about. In the end sales aren't the most important thing. If Erikson cared about sales he wouldn't have made this series so anti mainstream. Sometimes the best art is difficult to read or listen to or look at. Erikson is no simpleton which is clearly reflected in the complexity of his writing and his world. His work in the fields of archaeology and anthropology is clearly seen in the vivid and succinct descriptions of architecture and the many cultures that inhabit his world. Erikson has created one of the greatest works of fiction of all time on the same level with George R.R. Martin and J.R.R Tolkien. The first book might be difficult to slog through, but the reward in the end is worth the benefit. This series gets better once the reader understands his world better.<br /><br />It is also true that certain issues don't get resolved in the first book which is a little bit irritating at first, but that is something that will have to wait until his third book, memories of ice. The concepts that he wove and plotlines that get dropped finally meet together and start making more since by then. Erikson weaves a tapestry of words and plotlines that has hidden layers of depth to it. Characters might have a conversation that the reader might not understand at the time, only to realize what the characters were talking about later in the book and the same is true of multiple events which may at first not seem to be linked, but are. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell who is on which side, and who is evil or good; sometimes it can even be difficult to tell if there is any good in this series. The divide between good and evil isn't so clearly drawn. Sometimes by doing good a character is actually doing evil and by doing evil a character could actually be doing good.<br /><br />This book has weaknesses of course like all good books. There are a lot of characters and there is a lot going on within this novel, as a result of this many of the characters sound the same, not really having a voice of their own. The characters that do have a voice are often very over the top such as Kruppe. Who refers to himself in the third person? Kruppe's dialogue is funny and entertaining to read, but his arrogance is very unrealistic. Nobody talks like him. There is also a lot of dialogue in this series, way too much in fact, and sometimes characters will say words or convey their thoughts in a way that isn't realistic to how people actually talk. This could be a turn off for some since so much dialogue at once can be difficult to comprehend, but I find the way he handles dialogue to be quite intriguing.<br /><br />Erikson's series isn't something I would recommend to a light reader who just reads for enjoyment. I'm more likely to recommend this fantastic series only to people who are really into fantasy (like me). The series gets even harder to understand by Deadhouse gates mainly because he takes the reader away from the action that is happening on Genabackis and introduces the reader to many new settings happening in a different part of the Malazan Empire, but this is necessary for understanding what is happening within the war and the Empire itself. This series takes patience to get into, and is not for everybody. It's a love it or hate it kind of thing, most people won't be as enthusiastic about it as me.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin creates diverse, interesting, realistic characters which the reader quickly identifies with.  Some you love, some you hate...but regardless the reader can't wait to learn what happens next with each and every one.  The seven kingdoms of Westeros and the Free Cities will excite the historic imagination as the reader attempts to project these onto the map of the real world.<br /><br />Martin never fails to surprise.  Just when you think you have an understanding of a particular character, he throws you a curve you never saw coming.  The rich, fascinating characters do things you would never dream they would (or could) do.  So far none of the characters have escaped playing their part in the game of thrones, even those who don't understand that they are in the game.<br /><br />I only recently started the fifth book, A Dance with Dragons.  Anyone who has gotten this far in the series will not be daunted by the 76 chapters...in fact I wish it was a 176, I never want this story to end.  I highly recommend the complete Song of Ice and Fire series to anyone who enjoys a rich and compelling story by an incredibly fine story teller.
B0007X6ST2|5.0|Want to add my enthusiasm to what's already been posted here about Sting's live Bring on the Night CD.  I first saw this live concert on a neighbor's VCR in about 1987 and was entranced by the music.  So it was in the back of my mind to purchase it on cd and/or dvd at some point.  It is the best live concert I have ever heard along with Sade's live concert in San Diego from 1985, and Bryan Duncan's nehosoul band more recently (which I found on youtube).  Music just doesn't get much better than this unless it also happens to be gospel!  I haven't listened to both discs yet because I haven't gotten passed listening to Bring on the Night over and over when I need something enjoyable and relaxing to listen to.  Yes, relaxing because the harmonizing goes on and on for over eleven minutes and one starts memorizing the harmonies.  I don't think any group of back up singers has ever had more fun than Sting's with this song.  Donnabellasdigest.com

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I picked this up due to rave reviews from friends and the media.  Waste of time.  While I enjoy a good steamy romance like the next girl, this was ridiculous.  Every scene is a sex scene.  There is absolutely no plot to this book. Every page is some form of kinky sex, then the question of if she will become a submissive or not, then more sex.  That's it, the whole book in a nutshell.  No romance, no love, just sex. Total waste of time!
B00633PFQC|3.0|This subject matter would have been better covered in an article, rather than a book.  The author did not have enough solid arguments to prove the premise in a number of the examples.  I agreed with the overall premise before I read the book, and after reading the book I doubted the premise more rather than affirmation having been the result.  Just a so-so read.
030758836X|1.0|This is the first novel I've deleted from my Kindle. I don't want it to infect my others with its grime, grit and slime. The first half was clever and engaging, fine for a \\"beach read\\" and kept me clicking forward quickly. But the second half and especially the ending put the book on my \\"worst ever\\" list. It seems as if the author was under pressure to produce another best seller, started out strong and then ran out of time.

B001OSIV62|5.0|This documentary is one of my favorites I've seen. The story is told with dramatic flair, and the filmmaking is high-quality. The music is effective and contributes to the film's mood, and the electricity of the event is conveyed through the participants' words and the documentarian's choices.

0345803485|1.0|After hearing all the hype about this book I decided to give it a try and purchased it. I was hoping for something akin to the Sleeping Beauty trilogy by Anne Rice, or maybe The Story of O. Wrong!<br /><br />This book is very poorly written and reads like a young adult novel. The sex scenes are boring and laughable, the characters shallow and uninteresting. I found out later that this was originally written as Twillight fan fiction. I wish I had known that before I spent money on this piece of garbage.
0515149489|5.0|The Search is a romantic suspense that kept me guessing and warmed my heart. I quite literally couldn't put it down. Ms. Roberts creates the characters so well I felt like I could see them and knew their personalities. Fiona is strong, despite a tortured past. Simon is irresistibly created in the bad-boy image. Love him! The way the search dogs are twined into the story is both adorable and fascinating. The Search is a must read.<br />-R.T.

B007R21JJK|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT entry/mid level motherboard packed with the latest technical features, and at a VERY good price ($149) for what you get!  Includes things like; (6) USB 3.0 ports, (2) SATA 3.0 ports, a PCI-Express 3.0 x16 slot, Intel's new z77 chipset (optimized for Ivy Bridge CPUs), an mSATA SSD slot (for a solid-state hard drive), an onboard 2-digit LED diagnostics display, an \\"all-digital\\" voltage regulator, and Gigabyte's standard dual BIOS chips.  The board instantly recognized my Intel Ivy Bridge CPU with no problems.  The mobo arrived pre-installed with BIOS version \\"F7\\", and I updated it to the newest \\"F17\\" BIOS with no complications.  Gigabyte boards are among the highest quality mobo's on the market (IMO), and they have a long-standing reputation for stability & reliability.  As a result, I didn't have a single problem on the build or initial boot-up.  I have been building my own computers for the past 16 years, and have never had a single problem with Gigabyte motherboards.  And with their new \\"Ultra Durable 4\\" construction features, (which are designed to fight against humidity, electrostatic discharge, high temperatures, and power surges), this is one of their best entry/mid-level boards.<br /><br />Some Tips...<br />BIOS: The best and most reliable way to update the BIOS is with the \\"Q-Flash\\" option located directly within the BIOS settings (just press the DEL key upon first boot-up to enter the BIOS settings).  The other option of updating the BIOS through the \\"Windows OS\\" can sometimes be unreliable.  And for the \\"best\\" compatibility in flashing the BIOS with a USB thumbdrive (through the Q-Flash option), use a thumbdrive that is formatted to FAT-16 or FAT-32, and 4GB or under. It's also recommended to select \\"Load Optimized Defaults\\" before doing a BIOS update, then just re-tweak all your preferred BIOS settings after the reboot.<br /><br />USB PORTS: Also, the exact (2) USB ports to use for both flashing the BIOS, and to later plug your mouse &keyboard in to install the Windows Operating System, are the 2 side USB ports DIRECTLY UNDER the RJ-45 Ethernet port.  The reason being is that those are the only (2) \\"Intel\\" brand USB ports that are already USB 2.0 compatible, with no need to install any drivers.  The other (4) USB ports are all \\"VIA\\" brand USB ports, and will NOT work at all until AFTER the VIA USB 3.0 drivers are installed, which of course you can't do until after the OS is fully installed and you have a functioning CD drive, or have Internet access. These VIA USB 3.0 drivers are located on both the Gigabyte installation CD and the Gigabyte website.  (Unfortunately, many reviewers claim to have a defective board because these 4 USB ports didn't work upon first boot-up, but all they simply needed were the VIA drivers installed).  OR...if your computer case has a couple of USB ports on the front panel, you can simply use these for your mouse & KB (and USB BIOS flashing) simply by hooking the USB case cables into any of the (3) USB 2.0 headers located directly on the front of this motherboard. SIDENOTE: Though many say that USB 3.0 was developed too quickly and can be a bit \\"quirky\\" at times with Windows OS's, I'm hopeful that any USB 3.0 issues will eventually be resolved with future Windows Service Packs.<br /><br />*UPDATE 7/2013* It appears the \\"VIA\\" manufacturer has been pretty slow to iron out some of the bugs of their USB ports by the delayed release of updated drivers. For I come across some blogs that reflect that some people are having VIA USB 3.0 stability problems on \\"all\\" brands of motherboards. Perhaps this whole issue has been resolved in the latest \\"Revision 1.1\\" Gigabyte motherboard (this board is a version 1.0). But otherwise, it appears some people may have to just wait for VIA to release some new drivers for their USB ports. :(<br /><br />RAM: Though my 1600 MHz RAM defaulted at 1333 MHz in the BIOS, (this was before I updated to the latest BIOS however) this was easily fixed inthe BIOS settings by simply selecting \\"Extreme Memory Profile 1\\" (XMP), which is located in the \\"Advanced Frequency Settings\\" section (this is a very common fix). FYI, 1600 MHz is the highest intended/native RAM speed to run with Intel's Ivy Bridge CPU's, and 1333 MHz is the highest/native speed for the Sandy Bridge CPU's...without being overclocked that is.  Which BTW, to overclock beyond those native speeds, you will need an Intel CPU with a \\"K\\" at the end of its title, (ex: Intel i5-3570K), which simply means the Intel CPU is not \\"locked\\", and various settings can be manually tweaked in the BIOS.  Then the RAM speed can be safely overclocked (amung many other things relating to the CPU) and the CPU will be \\"fully compatible\\" with the faster RAM speeds. Plus, for maximum compatibility, make sure you buy RAM that rated at 1.5 volts.  Using RAM with a higher voltage (say 1.65 volts for example) should still work perfectly fine.  But according to Intel's return policy, using a voltage higher than 1.5 volts will then officially void the Intel CPU warranty.  With that said however, some Intel customers have had success in disputing this return policy since the retail packaging on their higher voltage RAM modules state that it is \\"fully compatible\\" with their particular Intel CPU (even when Intel says the higher voltage voids the warranty).  Yes, at best it's somewhat of an overly-cautious Intel policy, and perhaps just a convenient \\"grey-area\\" excuse for Intel not send out a replacement CPU.  So, the voltage is something you may want to consider when purchasing RAM for this motherboard.<br /><br />HARD DRIVE: If you buy a SATA-3 mechanical hard drive for this motherboard, don't expect to get the rated 6 Gb/s, or even the rated 3 Gb/s on SATA-2 hard drives.  This max. spec is the maximum \\"potential transfer rate\\" at a full-speed spin. In real-world applications, no \\"mechanical\\" hard drive in existance will reach anything NEAR those read/write speeds.  More realistic expectations for typical transfer rates on these mechanical SATA-3 or SATA-2 drives will range between 70-115 Mb/s, and there is really not a huge differance between the two drives.  However, the mSATA SSD's (Solid State Drives) CAN and DO reach these blazing 6 Gb/s speeds, simply because there are no moving parts to slow it down (just chips).  But, they are somewhat limited in size (currently anyway) and are much more expensive.  However, if you can afford it, this motherboard does have one open mSATA SSD slot.  Keep in mind though, that unlike a simple \\"plug-n-play\\" mechanical hard drive, this SSD drive will take some special set-up procedures, so keep that in mind as well.<br /><br />VIDEO CARD: When buying a video card for this motherboard, and you are a hard-core gamer, there is currently no real need to pay the higher  price for a PCI-Express 3.0 video card (vs. a PCI-Express 2.0 card).  No video game on the market can max-out the bandwidth of a PCI-E 2.0 slot (at the time of this review anyway).  Though it IS recommended to install your PCI-E 2.0 video card in this motherboard's PCI-E 3.0 slot, it's not required to spend the extra money on a PCI-E 3.0 card right now, for it will perhaps be a few years before a 3.0 video card will make enough of a significant difference to warrant the higher-priced purchase.  By then, it will be time to upgrade your card anyway...if your a hard-core gamer that is.  However, if you do NOT plan on upgrading your video card for a very long time, then I actually WOULD recommend investing in a PCI-E 3.0 video card.  This whole inbalance is just a case where the video card industry is simply way ahead of everyone else right now, and the gaming industry has yet to reach the potential bandwidth of the 3.0 cards, but there is no doubt that they will eventually.  Simply put, the PCI-E 3.0 slot on this mobo is a GREAT \\"future-proof\\" slot to have, but the future is not today. But if you can find a good sale on a 3.0 card, then of course gofor it.  NOTE: If buying a PCI-E 3.0 video card with an Intel CPU on this motherboard, keep in mind that currently only the \\"Sandy Bridge E\\" CPUs (the 2nd  generation of Sandy Bridge) and the Ivy Bridge CPUs (and anything after that) will \\"officially\\" support the max bandwidth of a PCI-E 3.0 video card.  Otherwise with an older CPU, (since the CPU must also process the video card's bandwidth) the PCI-E 3.0 video card will simply default to PCI-E 2.0 bandwidths, even if it is in a PCI-E 3.0 slot.  It won't hurt anything to have a 3.0 card in either PCI-E slot, or combined with any CPU generation, it's just something to be aware of to avoid any unrealistic expectations.<br /><br />MY NEW BUILD:<br />CPU: Intel i5-3570K, Ivy Bridge 3.4GHz<br />CPU COOLER: Zalman LED, 100% Copper, 92mm<br />CPU COMPOUND: \\"Coollaboratory Liquid Pro\\" (better than \\"Artic 5\\")<br />RAM: Corsair Vengeance 4GB DDR3, 1600 MHz, 1.5v (model: CMZ4GX3M2A1600C9)<br />VIDEO CARD: EVGA GeForce GTX 550 Ti, PCI-E 2.0<br />HARD DRIVE: Western Digital Caviar Black, SATA-3, 1TB<br />CD DRIVE: ASUS 24x DVD Burner<br />KEYBOARD: Corsair Vengeance K90 LED Gaming Keyboard<br />PSU: SeaSonic S1211, 80 Plus Bronze, 520 Watt<br />OS: Windows 7, 32-Bit<br />* Though a 64-bit Operating System IS the future, at the time of posting this review, it is still a bit too early for my taste to commit (but that's just me).  That's because  \\"some\\" 3rd-party software programs have still not ironed-out all the bugs of a 64-bit programming structure, and they can sometimes be somewhat quirky. But this is becomming much less of an issue as time goes on.  However, if you need more than the 32-bit OS's max spec of 4GB of installed RAM, (though the LARGE majority of home systems won't) a 64-bit OS is of course the way to go.<br /><br />NOTE: The above CPU thermal compound mentioned is pretty awesome stuff to help keep your CPU cool (with the benchmarks to prove it).  It looks like liquid mercury, comes in a thin-needle syringe, andit is 100% pure \\"liquid metal alloy\\" for optimal thermal transference.  BUT, the company does NOT recommend it for CPU coolers with an \\"Aluminum\\" bottom base. I just wanted to mention that very important requirement.

B000YD7F10|5.0|One of the greatest \\"theme\\" albums ever.  Anyone who doesn't appreciate this definitely does NOT ROCK!  Yes, Hotel California outsold it, but this is the pure original Eagles in all of their glory.  Even throwing in J.D. Souther and Jackson Browne for good measure(see dead outlaw pictures & songwriting credits.)  There is no more quintessential Eagles music than this.  Being from their generation, I can truly say that they did with this album what we all wanted to do.  They brought the Cowboy to life!  \\"Well the towns lay out across the dusty plains  like graveyards filled with tombstones  waitin' for their names..\\"  American cowboy poetry.
B0083IQFD2|3.0|Was excited to see the release of this EP by Banks and enjoyed the construction of her raps as well as the innovative progressions.  I hope to see hear a full album release some time in the near future and hope to see some more variations and not a degeneration to just standard rapping.  Highly recommended to all!
B001E75QH0|5.0|Couldn't wait for the package to arrive. The 4 dvds are tightly packed into a thin case which is great because it doesn't take up a lot of room. The dvds were great. Just as I remembered when the movie came out. I recommend this set.
B0083UWX04|5.0|If you do not know what a great artist Martha Argerich is, it is not possible to explain this phenomenal artist in a brief review. But it is clear to those of us who have listened to her for decades, that she is one of the great pianists of our time. And if you do know her as an artist you will be familiar with her CD recordings of the Tchaikovsky with Abbado, Kondrashin and Dutoit. All stunning recordings: perhaps even definitive as Gramophone says of her recording of the Tchaikovsky under Abbado. She has also done a marvelous Prokofiev on DGG.<br />So, her talent is not in dispute. But I sometimes think we forget the astonishing technical difficulty of the works we listen to these days and the intensity of focus required of these great performers. Therefore, to see her play these concerti is almost a revelation even for one, like me, who has listened to these works for decades. These performances are brilliantly played by a brilliant artist. There are moments when you listen and watch in disbelief. Her amazing musicality and technique are almost otherworldly.<br />And I think most viewers will be surprised at  the orchestral accompaniment<br />and the fine performances of the conductors: Sir Charles Groves and Andre Previn, who has still conducted the best Rachmaninoff Symphony 2 I have ever heard. Of course, as is always the case, such reviews are subjective. But I found the performances to be thrilling. And I very highly recommend this DVD.<br />The video is excellent for its time and the sound is splendid.<br />Do yourself a favor and purchase this DVD. You will not regret a minute of it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Whenever a hand is dealt you get a stupid ad. Easy enough to by pass, but annoying none the less.
0670022950|5.0|This is a must-read book for every historian, every psychologist, every leader, every citizen...  The breadth of his research is matched by his readability and use of familiar cultural reference points such as movies, music, politics, and even advertizing.  One cannot now claim to be \\"well-read\\" unless you have read this book.  It is that good.
B007SGM084|5.0|I think some people are so ignorant!!  Giving this trilogy a bad review because they are TOO CHEAP to purchase it??<br /><br />I did not want to read this book due to all the hype, but my friend let me borrow her copy and so I read.  I've heard this book is described as a \\"housewives porno.\\"  I believe that is a poor misrepresentation of the series.  I loved, loved, loved these books and did not want the story to end.  Very well written and I cannot wait for the movie!!
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Hot chicks in skimpy outfits, creepy noirish cinematography, cool fantastic landscapes and fight scenes, a dragon and Scott Glenn. What could possibly be bad about this movie?<br /><br />Other than, like, everything?<br /><br />This movie was abysmal. Watching someone play UNCHARTED is more interesting than this movie because at least that video game has interesting characters, a good plot and is coherent. Look, COULD this have been a good movie? Yes. But the storytelling is completely incomprehensible and when it's not, it's insipid.<br /><br />Zach Snyder does action brilliantly, but he is not a storyteller. Here, he even created the story, so it's doubly awful. Dark themes, a mental asylum, girls in danger and a prison escape are all great pieces - as is the idea of a girl creating her own world to escape from the horrors of her reality. But it needs to be cohesive. There is no connection between the real world, the imagined world, and the dreamworld.<br /><br />In the climax of THE MATRIX, we are concerned about what happens to our characters when they're in the Matrix because we know it will affect them in reality. We're also brought back and forth between those worlds to understand the consequences of actions and decisions made in each world. We see both sides. SUCKER PUNCH eschews these cinematic rules in favor of ten-minute video game fight levels that hold no suspense because it all happens in the main characters mind and no one can get hurt. If these sequences mirror what is happening in the real world, we either never see it or it's so poorly connected that all suspense disappears.<br /><br />Zack Snyder is not Christopher Nolan. Go watch INCEPTION instead.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|This movie put me and my wife to sleep.  Its a classical example of don't make sequels. Boring!!  One positive note for the movie, we learned to use our game console instead of Roku.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I thought that I would never find some thing to help me sleep or meditate while on the go this is the best that worked so far!!!
B008NABUU8|5.0|a really cool game! you have to have brains and I like the landscapes. concept is simple but even at the beginning levels can be tricky. try to build triangles ;)

B007R12TNQ|1.0|Seriously, this whole movie could have been condensed down to 5 minutes. There was no plot, it was extremely boring, had lame acting and ideas were stolen from youtube & ripped off from Castaway. There was a lot of fluff. Not worth watching. First Chipmunks was great, Second was decent, this one terrible. Typical trilogy. Plus, I didn't like the way disobedience was glorified in this film.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app but wish the apple would have come out a little earlier tot kindle fire. by the time it was released, all of the apple players had bottom tired of it.
B0073U2F12|5.0|This was a great movie. My wife even enjoyed it. She does not like most of the movies that I do. The 3D was great. It added to the film in a way that made it better. It was not there as a flashy gimmick, rather a way to enhance the film. Make sure to watch the 8 min short after you watch the movie. It really pulls it together. I think, it might even, leave it open for a sequel.
B0086700CM|5.0|hi I'm Madison lei and I would like 2 give this game a5 star rating also it is a Gerry Gerry fun game to play
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have used similar models of this product for many years.  They are light weight and the sound quality is excellent considering their costs.  They are easy to store and unlike plug in ear buds will not easily fall out.
0316056863|4.0|Funny and honest. It would make a good beach read. She's as funny on paper as she is on TV.

B0086C5EKA|5.0|\\"Shame\\" is an amazing film.  It is raw, gritty and sexual.  But it has a point.  What I saw in this film was a guy, Brandon played by Michael Fassbender, who has the biologic urges that most men have.  There is some hint of a dysfunctional past that we never fully understand, except through glimpses with his sister played by Carey Mulligan.  However, as much as Brandon needs sexual adventure, he almost totally lacks a capacity for intimacy.  Some have called the look of the film austere and cold from Brandon's icy urban apartment to his work cubicle to the subway trains he rides.  This mirrors his internal state and emphasizes the lack of human warmth.<br /><br />Sex, when it comes from love, produces some of the most valuable and important of human experiences -- feelings of acceptance, joy, security, tenderness, passion and beauty.  When sex comes from a self-centered place of lust, it can be one of the most damaging of human emotions.<br /><br />The date that Brandon has with coworker Marianne, played by Nicole Beharie, contrasts Marianne's search for love and Brandon's need to satisfy desire.  As a result, Brandon hires prostitutes that he can use and be done with, scans computer sex sites, prowls at clubs, and has his momentary satisfaction, but is left with an internal emptiness that haunts him, played so well by Fassbender.  After a fight with his sister, Brandon fingers a girl at a bar which leads to a beating by her boyfriend which leads Brandon to follow a guy eyeing him into a gay club which leads to shame and his need to atone by having two women at the same time.  This poor guy is so trapped; he spins from sexual episode to episode like a rat in a maze.<br /><br />The film is bookended by Brandon staring at a woman on the subway, played by Lucy Walters.  At the opening of the film, he leers at her, flirting, until she reveals a wedding band which only whets his appetite.  At the end of the film, he again sees the same girl and looks at her coldly, which I read as a lesson learned that casual sex would not bring him ultimate satisfaction.<br /><br />I am impressed by the number of awards this film won:<br />Black Reel Awards: Best Director, Best Screenplay<br />British Independent Film Awards: Best Actor (Michael Fassbender)<br />Evening Standard British Film Awards: Best Actor<br />Florida Film Critics Award: Best Actor<br />Hollywood Film Festival: Supporting Actress of the Year (Carey Mulligan)<br />Irish Film & Television Awards: Best Actor<br />London Critics Circle Film Awards: British Actor of the Year (Michael Fassbender)<br />Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards: Best Actor<br />Online Film Critics Society Awards: Best Actor<br />Vancouver Film Critics Circle: Best Actor<br />Venice Film Festival: Best Film, Best Actor<br /><br />Fassbender's performance is fearless, edgy and makes us ache for this man who has so much potential, and yet is so screwed up and unhappy.  Carey Mulligan turns in an excellent performance as his sister.  James Badge Dale also turns in a strong supporting performance as David, Brandon's boss who has a fling with Brandon's sister, Sissy.<br /><br />This film is not sedate.  It is not polite.  It is uncompromising in its exploration of one of the most basic of human emotions.  I loved it.  Bravo!I read as a lesson learned that casual sex would not bring him ultimate satisfaction.<br /><br />I am impressed by the number of awards this film won:<br />Black Reel Awards: Best Director, Best Screenplay<br />British Independent Film Awards: Best Actor (Michael Fassbender)<br />Evening Standard British Film Awards: Best Actor<br />Florida Film Critics Award: Best Actor<br />Hollywood Film Festival: Supporting Actress of the Year (Carey Mulligan)<br />Irish Film & Television Awards: Best Actor<br />London Critics Circle Film Awards: British Actor of the Year (Michael Fassbender)<br />Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards: Best Actor<br />Online Film Critics Society Awards: Best Actor<br />Vancouver Film Critics Circle: Best Actor<br />Venice Film Festival: Best Film, Best Actor<br /><br />Fassbender's performance is fearless, edgy and makes us ache for this man who has so much potential, and yet is so screwed up and unhappy.

0802130208|5.0|This book is entertaining and extrodinary well written.  It made me laugh reading about the elder Miss Trixie who was not allowed to retire because of people wanting to \\"help her\\".  The book is insightful and an amazing observations about the condition of life.  I don't want to give anything away not out of rudeness, but the book is just a pleasure to read and I don't want to spoil it.  Honestly, this is absolutely the best book I have ever read.  If I could read only one book in my life...this book would be my selection.  I have given this book as holiday gifts to friends and family and they have nothing but praise for it.  Read it and enjoy : ).
B001QJUX24|5.0|This is one of the best Western movies ever made! I have watched it probably 20 times. Outstanding. Don't miss it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games seem to work slow on my kindle fire. otherwise I would have given five stars.  good fun when bored
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is a fantastic book and the first one I've read of Gillian Fylnn's.<br /><br />I've heard great things about GONE GIRL (Just bought it,) but wanted to read something else of hers first. I was not disappointed either. Her writing if first rate and the characters are anything but ordinary. The book really did a great job of keeping you interested in the murder story as much as you were fascinated with the characters.<br /><br />It is dark, no question, and it visits some place in humanity that you never want to hang out in the real world, but I really enjoyed the read.<br /><br />Now, on to GONE GIRL.
0307970299|5.0|I brought this book in all of it's forms, CD,hardback and Kindle. The book is destine to become a classic. I couldn't put it down and now I'm reading it again...
B007V2UGPE|3.0|It would be a good game but I cannot get the game to start<br />My grandson likes it. Played once. I hope they fix it soon.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|Another Earth is not a perfect film; it can feel clunky and inert at moments. It is, however, a fairly well crafted piece of art that will get one thinking about...possibilities. I will try to make this review short, sweet and (major) spoiler free.<br /><br />Our protagonist- a brilliant and beautiful teenager, well trained in astronomy- finds herself at the heart of an unthinkable tragedy, in the blink of an eye. Her life changes via chance (or fate), all the while the world around her is transforming. This is a story of love, loss, uncertainty and redemption. Those turning to this film for CGI and sci-fi glam will be sorely disappointed in this picture.<br /><br />My best advice is to approach this movie with a completely open mind. The science behind this motion picture is highly questionable and likely deemed as \\"bad science\\" to those actually versed in science (two earths would inevitably affect the tides via gravitational pull of moons...). If you can overlook the flawed scientific logic and focus on the film's emotive aspects instead, you may get a satisfying experience out of viewing this movie.<br /><br />Another Earth is a character study more so than a science fiction feature. It's also a tragic love story in an abstract sense. Though in essence \\"Another Earth\\" is riding along the wave of \\"end of the world\\" or \\"end of the world as we know it\\" films (think \\"Melancholia\\" & the terrible \\"4:44\\"), it can stand on its own as a solid drama. The pace is slow and steady; there are no flashy twists or frills to be had here. The cinematography is stunning in points, but never for vanity's sake. Everything about this film feels well thought and deliberate(despite the fact that it is not treading brand new ground all in all...).<br /><br />I recommend this film, but highly expect that it will not be well received by all...
B00260HH3K|1.0|the is a terrible movie if you are a dbz fan don`t watch it watch the series then this then you`ll hate the movie and everyone who took part i`m this account owner`s son and a fan know pretty much everything about the show not the actors now this is the stupidest thing that has to do with any anime i`d rather watch paint dry then this disgrace to any anime even the bad ones like fruit basket or host club
6304711905|5.0|No complaints what so ever. Product showed up when they said it would and was in perfect conditions. Will continue shopping here for sure.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it's worked pretty well for me so far, but I only use it for simple math in a hurry. That is all :)
B000H30B2C|5.0|Quite a long movie, but what a thrill to watch! I expected a movie about a giant ape, because I knew virtually nothing about this movie, and got a film concerning the tyranny of the real world with dinosaurs, humungous bees, and other huge special effects. I loved it not only for its superficial superiority as a movie, but also for all the implications concerning beastliness and beauty, psychology and tyranny, and the world we really live in. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who has the time to watch it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so wonderful to be reminded that GOD'S word is the most important thing we can do each day.
B006RUJST6|1.0|I bought this book after reading the reviews and thinking it would be amazing. It wasn't. I couldn't even finish it. I can't stand the female lead character. The emotions are so unrealistic and selfish with the usual temper tantrums. It's typical, ridiculous teenage bull crap with no real substance.
B00007E7K0|5.0|The Canon 58mm Lens cap is really great, the quality is good and it fits perfectly over my 58mm filters for the Canon SX40.
B002ZP1STK|5.0|Very touching movie!  Kid has unstoppable spirit!!!  Too bad there are too many adult situations to keep it from being appropriate for younger children.  Highly recommend it!
B004U8VUUC|3.0|In my opinion, this movie left so much out. And it is rather disappointing that the stories are quite different.  Still, this was not a bad movie.  As others have said, the first half is the better half.  I fail to see the fuss over Ryan Goslin. He was horrible in this movie and as far as I know, I have never seen him in anything else and never heard of him before seeing this flick.  Kirsten Dunst alwasy seems to bring her A+ game even when the scripts are lame.<br /><br />The movie could have been much better if they would have just left the \\"true\\" story disclaimer out and brought it to a solid end.  After Katherine's disappearance, the movie falls flat on its face and makes no sense at all.  No attempts to revive it were made.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|pep is the man.  my son loves this guy. thanks pep. I will pay whatever I need to.  next is Mario.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This is a good book I had it figured out in no time though I was getting so angry close to the end.I don't want to say to much for fear of giving away the ending. This a must read though get the book you will not be disappointed.
B000002KDW|5.0|Every song here is great and shows the Faces in top form.  Rod is actually trying on this one.  Get this and Oh La La and you have 2 amazing albums that highlight the Faces at their best!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game.I was not sure if i would like it or not but the first time i played it i was hooked. Thank you
B00000JNJ1|3.0|What is here is very good (except the Faces take on Dylan's Wicked Messenger which is really BAD) but how can they exclude That's All You Need perhaps their best song????  Skip this and get A Nod Is As Good As A Wink To A Blind Horse and Oh La La and you will truly have their best.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|Very happy with our purchase! We saw it on TV recently and decided to buy the DVD. It is nice that it comes with the bonus info too, altho we haven't watched that part yet. But we are very happy with the movie, thanks!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good read, interesting not for the sexually shy. Once you read the first you will need to read all three. Laters...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes the trilogy was a little long, and at times the writing wasn't stellar, but overall, I loved the book.  This was my first romance/erotic novel and I'm not afraid to admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I loved how I witnessed Christian and Ana fall in love with each other and as flawed as Christian is, you can't help but root for the guy.  Not sure I will ever find another set of characters and in general, a story like this.  \\"Barred to You\\" is not it!  There was no love there, just lust.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|Excellent product, like all NERF products. My kid is having so much fun with this gun playing with his brothers and friends.
B0086DBE62|3.0|The movie was a disappointment but perhaps I should have read more about it before watching.  Usually, I love Julia Roberts' movies but this one was unlike any that I'd seen her in before.
B000H7J9S0|4.0|\\"The Brothers Grimm\\" (2005) is directed by Terry Gilliam. It stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as two brothers who fight sorcery and various supernatural elements. The film is full of amusing characters and delightfully unexpected visual turns. For those that appreciate their fantasy/horror with imaginative, and over the top humour (Pirates of the Carribbean, Evil Dead 2) then this might suit their taste.<br /><br />The blu-ray looks great and there are a few extra features including deleted scenes, audio commentary with the director, and a short feature on the special effects seen in the film with views by Terry Gilliam.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Rebecca has done it once again! From the very start you are hooked!  Rebecca has a talent for bringing her characters to life, they are believable and you care for them.  A must read along with \\"The Forever Girl\\"  and I can not wait until her next book!!
0307887448|5.0|I picked up this book to read over the weekend. I started and didn't want to put it down. I read it straight through. It is a rousing good tale. As a gamer, geek and nerd who grew up in those same years the book talks about, I loved every single page. I would heartily like to thank Ernest Cline for putting a smile on my face that lasted from cover to cover and even after I put it down.
B00884GR0W|5.0|who cares if its not minecraft they're two whole different games and i prefer this one its way better and its only five bucks
B005HEUF0Y|5.0|This episode never fails to leave me in tears at the conclusion. Utterly poignant and incredibly moving, this is by far the best TNG episode ever.
B002LAM7PI|1.0|I watched this movie a few years ago when it first came out on DVD. I am fifteen and it still haunts me. It is very creepy and disturbing. My older sister was 21 at the time we watched the movie together and she had nightmares about it. I don't understand the hype. The people who gave this movie high praise must be demented. My cousin is also terrified of this movie. She watches horror movies all the time and they don't bother her, but she despises this movie. One time, my cousin and I were staying at a relative's house and there was a small door in the wall like the one Coraline crawls through in the movie to get to the other world. My cousin and I were so scared that we couldn't sleep in that bedroom. This movie is definitely not for kids!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I was looking for something along the lines of Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden books and this more than exceeded by expectations. Exciting & humorous, Aticus is a great character, although I think Oberon steals most of the scenes he is in :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book so much! I felt like I was having depression when I got through with it! Bared to You is a good book to read after this and also Gabriel's Inferno!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game for all ages.  Easy to navigate and play. Over 30 and I'm addicted. Have fun collecting all the interesting animals!
B006LSZECO|3.0|After a slow start, this book built to a real page-turner.  The pacing seems to be part of the story.  Without giving anything away, there are many twists and turns to experience.  After a great ride, I found the ending to be ultimately unsatisfying.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|deffintly a fun games I play it with my kids they love that everytime they beat a game they get a new one
B000SXLL8O|5.0|It is Coldplay's best. Their later albums have not yet reached the height of this one. Most of the tracks are worth listening.
B008E374T0|5.0|I'm very disappointed by all the low ratings this release is getting, if your a true fan of The Gaslight Anthem, you would give this release a solid 5 stars!  Brian Fallon is one of today's best rock writers and his band mates guitarist Alex Levine, drummer Benny Horowitz and bassist Alex Rosamilia, bring everything together and form one of the greatest rock bands since 2006.  On this their 4th long player \\"Handwritten\\",  The Gaslight Anthem give us more top notch treasures in \\"45\\", which would be a top 40 hit in the 70's.  \\"Keepsake\\", is a winner through and through, a top 10 song on a fair planet.  Other top tunes are the chestnut title track, \\"Biloxi Parish\\",  \\"Here Comes My Man\\", \\"Too Much Blood\\" and the classic sounds of \\"Desire\\" and \\"Mae\\".  The band brings in strings on the beautiful tune \\"National Anthem\\".  Of the 3 songs on the deluxe version, we get the hard chargin' melodic \\"Blue Dahlia\\", the excellent bass work of Alex Rosamilia on the Nirvana cover \\"Sliver\\" and the Tom Petty classic \\"You Got Lucky\\", with sharp guitar by Alex Levine.  Brendan O'Brien did a fine job producing this disc.  Keep up the great work guys, you're keeping this 52 year old ALIVE!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I finished the third book in the series, I felt I had lost contact with some good friends who had suffered much. Would love to read a another sequel.  Judy

B008B9JTLI|5.0|Foley spent twenty-five years in prison, had plenty of time to erase the past, gets released and begins to contemplate on a New beginning. However, regardless of his efforts, he finds himself getting involved with ghosts of his past. Once again, he's out on the streets and meets trouble face-to-face. Intense Suspense, Action-Packed, and Great Acting Performance of Samuel L. Jackson. A compelling story with chills and thrills. Highly Recommended!
B00000DHTF|5.0|I didn't need to know any other information about this set.<br />Unfortunately I have misplaced my much played, much loved original copy!<br />What can I say, Bruce at his best, the old stuff  really is the best!!<br />However his newer discs are good too.<br />Needless to say I am a big fan.<br />If you don't have this set then buy it and listen to it all again and again and again.<br />It will become your favourite disc.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I consider of myself a fan of Ripley and her xenomorph related antics, and this is fast becoming one my favorites. Don't get me wrong, I can understand why some people take issue with the open-ended-not-very-explicit-or-detailed writing style. In addition, there are a few scientific inaccuracies/ambiguities that might be distracting for some (although seeing how we never received much of an explanation as to how an organism can bleed molecular acid, or survive getting harpooned through the chest, or hibernate long enough for a \\"Gigantic Dead Body\\" to fossilize, or grow several times it's size without eating anything, or survive getting drowned in molten lead, I'm willing to let a few things slide in the film)<br /><br />This is definitely one of those films that just clicks with some and not with others. Simple as that. No, liking this film doesn't make you an idiot anymore than disliking it makes you an unfair nitpick with no life. It's basically a presentation of a few interesting events coupled with amazing visuals and a great score, so a lot is left to the viewer to pick apart and decide. I will say, however, that this is definitely a movie that makes a LOT more sense the second time you see it.<br /><br />Also, for you Sci-fi fans who can't stand any religious references, steer clear of this film and spare yourself (and fans of Prometheus) a big headache. I was raised in a mostly secular household with an occasional hint of neopaganism (pretty much a dogma free upbringing) so seeing a lead character who is a scientist and a person of faith does not induce a heart attack. In fact, I've met such people. So whenever some skeptic and/or new atheist blogger  whines that Dr. Shaw is a contradiction, I think to myself, \\"Um, yeah. Duh. That's kind of the point.\\"<br /><br />It also fascinates me that this film is getting pretty much the same reaction that Alien did. Perhaps only time (and maybe an extended cut) will tell us all how good this movie is or isn't, but in the meantime, I'm happy to let Davids sultry voice wash over me as I contemplate questions pertaining to creator and creation. Because there's still one REALLY important question that must be addressed, hopefully in the sequel:<br /><br />Why didn't Micheal Fassbender take his shirt off?
B00846REIS|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I enjoyed this book more than the first 50 shades book. Good news: GREAT WRITING! No repetitions, no cliche phrases, just none of the recurring nonsense. It was a very good read and I was upset I finished it. Can't wait for the book 2.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I LOVE this game. I log in every single day, multiple times a day, and have worked up to a level 74 in only two months. You can do this without spending any real money, but there are cool things you cant get without gems. But Team Lava has to make money somewhere! Highly recommend but be aware it is insanely addictive!

But I simply cannot locate nor play the music.  Where is it?  I have wasted time and money.  No more!!!!!<br /><br />Can I give zero stars?
B008IJTFYW|5.0|free deep sleep!!just what the doctor ordered.I can customize just the right mood music and its off to deep relaxing sleep.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I admit that I thought it would just be \\"another Sherlock Holmes movie, but played by Iron Man.\\" The reality, Robert Downey really attempts to allow the audience to look into the mind of Holmes'. Not just a goody two shoes trying to improve the world, but a maelevolent benefactor trying to pass the time in what would ba a rather trite existence.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This film is a little different from Miyazaki's other films but still just as good in a different way. Most Miyazaki fans will love this film but if you don't have that much love for his films it could just be average to you. I think this film is still better than most American movies. I recommend you to buy it if you love Miyazaki.
B005UD1D62|5.0|i thought it was a amazing book-- i actually was upset with the ending because it left me wanting for more. cant wait to read the next one
B0086DBE62|5.0|I thought this was a very cute movie. I enjoyed it a lot. I would recommend this movie. It all depends on what you like. I'm into fairy tale movies, if you are not this probably isn't for you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy navigation. I love the way I can change the version while reading inside the Bible &amp; don't have to select it beforehand. You can highlight verses and add notes to scripture. A few versions including KJV &amp; NKJV is available for download for offline viewing. Also includes reading plans and devotionals. I absolutely love this app and highly recommend you getting it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you think you have it all figured out, it takes another twist. Good character construction but sometimes it's a bit unbeleivable. Can anyone really be that cunning? I guess the author could.  This was an enjoyable read, better than most mystery genre novels.
0670023329|5.0|It is amazing that these camps exist in North Korea. My heart goes out to all the North Koreans who have experienced this level of cruelty. For those you who now can look back at those days, I wish you the best.
0062060562|2.0|Very disappointed in this Book. The use of the \\"F\\" word became a distraction. I think that the plot was okay but I figured out the ending before I was 1/3 of the way through.  Total waste of time. The author should not write from a woman's point of view because it became obvious the author was a man because women do not talk or think the way that he wrote. Stick to what he knows. \\"Man's drama with Men reading\\"  I do NOT recommend this book. I think he took 28 First Dates and stole the main idea and tried to make it something interesting.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I was not sure what to expect-- I hear people say that all the time.  That being said, it truly does apply to my review of this book.  I expected a young adult romance novel but what I procured was so much more.  I was very touched by this book, and the promise of \\"life\\" and hope when facing death and loss.  'Slammed' was not simply a love story, it was a book about relationships. About all the different kinds of relationships that a person needs in order to survive in this world.<br /><br />Will.  What can I say about Will?  What a beautiful man.  He is beyond the boy next door.  Smart. Kind. Thoughtful. Sexy.  The attraction between the two protagonists was palpable and believable.  I could easily feel the tension that mounted when Will and Lake were faced head on with one another, unable to converge because of the circumstances that would force them apart.  Wanting.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for those who love romance, as do I, and for those who love a thoughtful story about living the life you are dealt with courage and hope.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Universe saved!  All's well and then....where's Percy?  He is nowhere to be found.  And who is this mysterious stranger, Jason?  Rick Riordan gives us another side of the Gods (the Roman one) and their internal friction depending on whether they reflect their Greek or their Roman heritage.  And they do not get along so well, it seems.  That is also reflected in the outlook and behavior of the new hero, Jason, as he finds his way among the Greeks' demigods..  Can he and they ever get along?  Find out in this newest series of the Gods and demigods.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|better then most of the Mario like games. easy to control and simple worlds to start. good job over all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book It held my interest.  These type of books are very true to life but make you wish you could be that person.  About three quarters through<br /> the book you can't read fast enough.  I really loved the book.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I got this for my wife, and she absolutely loved it. She already had the movie on regular dvd, but having it on blu ray is way better. Its a must have for all he women in your life.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|So here's the thing:<br /><br />What most people don't realize, is that the original triogy already HAVE been (somewhat at least) restored. I own the Collector's Edition box set for laserdisc from 1993. Every frame of film was chemically cleaned for that one, and the sound remastered as well.<br /><br />The irony is is course, when the original trilogy was added to the DVD release a few years past, this what NOT the versions used, but something that looked like it came straight from a VHS tape.<br /><br />So all they need to do is to scan these prints and put them on a blu ray, because the more I read about the new 'aditions' to the movies, the more i cringe...
B000002KNI|5.0|it's like you are there experiencing the event - which i personally was. just a lot more room @ home than on the grass in Central Park. Definitely worth the nostalgia.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This application is simple to use. I wish that I had found this earlier. I. would strongly recommend this app.
B00870ZH3U|1.0|This was an absolutely abominable sequel; abysmal story line, contrived characters, with a banal score.  This is simply a catastrophy.  It took a beautifully layered story that ultimately opts for light and life and twists it into a dark and incomprehensible follow up to the original.  While the sets and costuming were lovely it is extremely difficult to fathom that the genius of Andrew Lloyed Webber conceived of this tripe; it is really the antithesis of the Phantom Of The Opera.  Ultimately a huge disappointment and complete waste of time.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|Silly dialogues.  Bad acting.  Uninspiring music.  The talent of Gary Oldman completely wasted in a movie like this.  It's a high school play with computer-generated special effects.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This books was amazing!!  Loved it!!  Can't wait to start the third one.  Once I started reading I could not put it down.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My 8-yr-old chose this game as a cake topper for his birthday party.  I found a picture on the internet and just set up the plastic pieces along with the birds and pigs on top of the cake.  Afterwards, we washed them with soap and water and he plays with it now.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games on this app are fun and addicting. My wife and I love them. we cant get enough of it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Tunein Radio Pro is a wonderful app, it searches automatically for similar stations in the style of music you have chosen. I highly recommend it to all music lovers, it also allows me to check police radios in the cities where my children live from the east to the west coast.<br /><br />Dr. Hunter
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Oooh, I like it! I love the customization options, and the sounds are very realistic. There are so many options it's almost mind boggling. There are also three preset \\"favorites.\\" One is ocean sounds, next is night sounds, and the last is storm. There are options for music such as music box, orchestra, piano, lounge, and even wind chime sounds. Plenty of nature sounds such as birds and frogs. You can mix your own sounds and save them as favorites. While I like the pre-set night sounds, I love the sound of crickets, and it was great that I could add them to my own night sounds mix. There is a timer available as well, so all in all, a very versatile app. Thanks so much to the developers!
B0073U2F12|5.0|Okay, I hate SiFi stuff. I think it sucks. It's lame, it's boring. But this movie was awesome! The 3D was so good! The cast was actually pretty good too. The only thing I don't like about it is that they never really explain what the \\"things\\" (balls of light/ electricity/ whatever) are. They're just like, \\"They feed on planets. They're gonna eat ours then leave. No way to win but let's keep fighting for 90 minutes.\\" The movies ends with something of a cliffhanger and there could easily be a sequel. But considering how bad the flick did at the box office, I seriously doubt there will be. Overall this movie is totally worth a watch. Especially in 3D. Great film.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Thrilling and not for the distracted viewer!  You really have to sit on the couch and lean-in to this story because it is as complex as it is compelling.
006197806X|4.0|Definitely NOT as good as the first book, but I still enjoyed it. Not gonna lie, though. The ending seriously depressed me! My poor baby Alex! I was so heartbroken for him. :'( Julian was a sweet guy an all, but if he ends up with Lena....There WILL be blood! Hahaha, sorry. But seriously, as much as I tried, I just couldn't really connect with Julian.<br /><br />All in all, it was a great read! It really sucked you in from the beginning to the heart-stopping cliffhanger. I just can't believe we have to wait so long for the next book!
B00845PV16|4.0|I don't understand all the hate and bad reviews for this movie.  It was a good movie, a fun ride and a compelling story!  Idris Elba is always welcome as far as I'm concerned.  Yes, the tone of this movie is much darker - less Disney-esque - and a tiny bit gruesome, but that is Ghost Rider!  It is based on a comic-book, but this is not a super-hero.  Vengeance is not optional.  Justice is preferred, but not mandatory.<br /><br />The most under-rated performance in the movie is Johnny Whitworth.  Perhaps best known for Empire Records, he plays against type as one of the villains, Ray Carrigan, and he is amazing.  He makes decisions with the role that makes him scarier than he is written.  There is a casual evil to his performance that was wildly successful.  It reminds me of Nick Cassavetes role of Packard in The Wraith plus a dash of Vincent Ventresca.<br /><br />Watch this.  It is PG-13, but the horror aspects may be better suited to older children.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Class act to be sure.  Well written, well acted, and of course, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are quite easy on the eyes. Suspenseful until the very end. What is it about British writers keeping us spellbound every second? Looking forward to more, but for now, I say, Well done!
B005LAIGP0|3.0|London, the turn of the century. Widowed lawyer Arthur Kipps is sent by his office to deal with the legal affairs of Eel Marsh House, whose owners wish to sell it. He finds the local village folk uncooperative and fearful of the house, apart from rich landowner Samuel Daily (who owns the only motorcar in the village). As Kipps investigates the mystery of Eel Marsh House, he learns of a spate of unusual deaths amongst the local children and starts seeing a woman dressed in black watching his activities.<br /><br />The Woman in Black is an adaptation of Susan Hill's 1983 novel of the same name. It was produced by the resurgent British company Hammer Film Productions, who in an earlier incarnation produced numerous horror films in the 1950s and 1960s. Unlike most of those films, which were noted for their use of blood and gore, The Woman in Black is a taut, claustrophobic piece which relies on tension and things glimpsed out of the corner of the eye.<br /><br />The film's casting is superb, with a post-Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe starring as Arthur Kipps (coincidentally, a role previously played by his on-screen father Adrian Rawlins in a 1989 TV movie based on the book). Radcliffe arguably risks more typecasting than any actor in film history, but his canny choice of stage and screen roles has seen him so far avoid that fate. In The Woman in Black he convinces in the role of the world-weary, grief-stricken father whose career as a lawyer is in doubt due to his growing disillusionment with the world. The only other major character is Samuel Daily, played with conviction by the always-excellent Ciaran Hinds.<br /><br />The director, James Watkins, handles the material well. His depictions of a village consumed by fear, the huge and rambling Eel Marsh House and of lonely and windswept marshlands are all excellent, giving the film a real sense of place. Knocking in at just 95 minutes, the film also doesn't outstay its welcome.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie shows its hand a little too early. Upon arriving in the village, Kipps is immediately greeted by fear, suspicion and terror, letting the audience know that All is Not Well. It's not long before just about every time we get a close-up on Kipps we also get some sinister stuff going on in the background, or every other time he turns around we get a shot of the Woman in Black hanging about for a moment. The first few times this happens, it's unsettling. Somewhere around the twentieth, it loses its power. Viewers will soon find themselves predicting when something 'scary' is about to happen and will, by and large, be right. The film does succeed in achieving a few genuine shocks despite this issue, the movie's second half is overall weakened by this predictability. Given writer Jane Goldman's solid form (Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class), it's surprising that she doesn't put more genuine twists into the script, especially given its deviations from the source material.<br /><br />The Woman in Black (***½) is well-made, excellently-acted, concise, focused and well-directed. The film is let down by its script, which relies a little too much on a single scare tactic and overplays it to the point of boredom. In this manner, The Woman in Black is the film equivalent of the computer game Doom 3: well-made, great in short bursts, but a little dull over the long haul. It is redeemed somewhat by a startling ending, however, and is certainly worth watching.ts hand a little too early.

B005CA4SQK|5.0|Awesome series, each episode is fantastic, the special features are also very interesting with well over an hour of material. What stood out to me the most was the amazing sound quality! If you have a good 5.1 surround sound set up you are in for a treat! From watching many of the Walking Dead special features I know how much emphasis they put into the sound; whether it be zombies groaning, twigs snapping, flesh being devoured, or of coarse guns shooting. They spend a lot of money and time just producing sounds to layer over the video with fantastic results!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book series. Couldnt wait to read this one. I read the first book in 48 hrs with sleep and work involved. Read this one on my kindle in 4 days. Great book. Even my husband read some and he hates to read.
B007O3QC8K|5.0|While driving from work recently, I happened to catch some mighty impressive music on the wireless. Although I didn't know what it was, I soon suspected it to be Bruckner. A panel of classical musicians discussed what turned out to be the 4th movement of the unfinished ninth and to a man they were lyrical about it, extolling the virtues of both the musicianship and the composition in no uncertain terms. Although I already have a couple of Bruckner ninths (Bruno Walter & Skrowachewski among them), I felt the Rattle/BPO would make a welcome addition to my discography. After having listened to it twice, I read some of the reviews on Amazon. Quite honestly I found some of them no more than bouts of apparently fashionable Rattle-bashing and nitpicking over the amount of terror the interpretation managed or failed to instill in the listener and the difficulty EMI were having with the recording venue. All I can say is that I found it a very well played, emotionally high charged performance in very fine sound; please do not allow yourself to be put off by the Rattle-bashers and hair splitters and judge the performance by its own merits, which are plentiful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is really good but I almost had all the games but thenthe update came and I lost it all but it is time consuming and it gives you something to do on your kindle fire

B007J4T2G8|5.0|love the book, can not wait to read the other two books. really enjoyed it. ana really stands her ground for the man she loves.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|Great storyline and it kept my attention. Sure would like to see more wholesome movies like this one produced rather than ones that teach violence and sexual permissiveness.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Before I read this book all I heard about were the politics that came with it which kind of discouraged me from wanting to read it.  But then I saw the movie was coming out soon and folded to reading it.  I came into reading this book with an attitude expecting it to be a wet-dream of a libtard.  But was surprised and kind of felt foolish.  The stuff this young lady goes through is insane!  I found myself relating her attitude and story to the modern-day young soldier over here in The Stan.  I've seen young men over here whose lives are forever changed because of their position as a pawn on the game board that the rich war pigs in Washington put them on.  I see it here, and read about it in the book.  I'm a RED, WHITE, and BLUE Conservative...but this book hit home.  There's something really wrong with America where US Military men like myself and all these young men and women make didly squat $$$ while the rich keep getting richer and have all their appendages.  This book filled me with anger toward the war pigs.  I would've given this book a higher rating if there was more action and less teeny-bopperness.  So I give 4 stars to this book and a big middle-finger to the war pigs in D.C.
B00846REIS|5.0|I started this book after reading Fifty. I needed something to fill the void haha. I fell in love with this book and the characters just like I did when I read Fifty. I finished it last night and was so bummed to find out the sequel won't be out until Oct 2nd!! I can't wait to keep reading and find out what happens in Gideon and Eva's relationship!
B00650SSDU|5.0|Very good flick!<br />Yes a total CHICK FLICK - However the guys will love it also.<br /><br />Put the kids to bed and watch it.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I had this cable replaced because the plastic that covers all the wires kept flaking off.  I received the new cable replacement and it has done the very same thing.  What is up with the plastic that covers the wires?  I now need a new cable because if I get shocked from using this cable someone is going to get sued.
B007SGM084|1.0|I downloaded this because of all of the fuss surrounding it. However, I must say I find it disturbing that so many found this book so compelling. It's sad that some women's fantasy is to be dominated by a man in her life. I also hated the autjor's use of talking from a subconscious or inner goddess. Totally weird and cheesy. I do not recommend this book. Don't waste your time. If you're looking for sexual deviance, there must be better reading out there.
B003TH7018|5.0|This episode of Legend of the Seeker has some really funny and lighthearted moments, and it provides some moments of solace (or heartache?) for Richard and Kahlan shippers. It is fascinating to watch Craig Horner (Richard) and Bridget Regan (Kahlan) play other characters who look like Richard and Kahlan and are attempting to impersonate Richard and Kahlan, but there are subtle and not so subtle differences there - it sounds complicated but it's a good old-fashioned tale of mistaken identity and impersonation and there are some wonderful scenes. I don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen it yet, so just watch it and enjoy it!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game. it is a great time waster! the options of the game are cool and I love that you don't have to drag each card to the stop you want,all you have to do is tap the card and it goes to the spot!  brilliant!
B003UXRZ0M|5.0|Another very funny episode in Legend of the Seeker, with a great story too. Kahlan has been captured, and only Zedd and Richard and Cara can save her - but what a sacrifice they must make in order to rescue her. You will never look at Cara the same way again once you have seen her pose as a princess. Her attempts at embroidery and poetry are memorable. And as for Zedd, I don't want to spoil it, but you will never look at Zedd the same way again either! Richard has problems of a different kind, as love is in the air.....! Again, the costumes are stunning, as is the scenery. Every episode of Legend of the Seeker is a visual treat, but this one will make you laugh too.
1451626657|5.0|It is hard to believe that 50 years have gone by since Catch-22 was first published. But I can say in all honesty that time has done nothing to damage this unique novel. It was a great book back then, and it is a great book today. And the fifty year edition with its additions to the original, in fact, make it an even better book today than when it first was published. It is a cliche, but a true one, that like some wines, Catch-22 gets better with age. I have a number of \\"sacred texts,\\" and this book is definitely one of them. There's just one catch. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .!
B003TH41H4|5.0|From the opening shots of this first episode of Series 1 I was bewitched. If you like fantasy and magic and adventure, then you will love this show, but that's not all it offers. Wonderful characters like Zedd (he is hilarious, watch out for when Kahlan meets him for the first time!), amazing costumes, the incredible scenery of New Zealand where the series was filmed, a love story, and of course the battle between good and evil, Legend of the Seeker has it all. The opening shots are haunting: two girls on horseback, one blonde and the other dark, riding for their lives, closely pursued by soldiers, they are trying to protect something, but time is running out......... This double episode will set you up for many hours of bewitching entertainment as you make your way through Season 1, and then Season 2.
1609410416|1.0|I'm a big fan of Ellen's.  Usually I find that her show's 3 minute monologues are amongst the most entertaining few minutes on TV.  I ordered this audio book thinking it would be a three hour monologue, it wasn't.  It's just not funny. Not once did I chuckle, much less laugh.  I don't believe I even cracked a grin during the whole thing.  I wouldnt reccommend it...
B000ZBUY78|5.0|I got this for my wife on our 11th wedding anniversary...she loved it and that is saying a whole lot! She has been wearing a wenger swiss watch for years and only wears white gold, platinum, or silver...this was a perfect fit. another great seiko purchase, thanks seiko.
B0085776BG|5.0|I was committed to buying this movie about the Tuskegee Airmen before I saw the movie, actually. I was not dissapointed. It was good historical fiction, action packed and entertaining. But when my 6 year old African American grandson was quoting lines from the movie and talking about being a pilot I really appreciated this movie more.

B00884GR0W|1.0|I know I'm not the only one who agrees. This is like a creepy, boy game. Now I'm a girl and I absolutely ADORE minecraft.  There are NOT any creatures that will give u nightmare's.  I watched the video for this game and the creatures scared the cr ap out of me. The music was so weird and creepy.  AND THERE ARE NO DOORS!!!! THE CREATURES COULD COME IN AND KILL U!!!!!!!!! Its the creepy boy version of minecraft. NEVER BUYING THIS $5 PIECE OF CRAP. I would kill my self if I DID buy it and my little 6 year old cousin got ahold of it and played Block story thinking it was minecraft. NOT TAKING THOSE CHANCES!!! Never buying this crappy app.

0062124293|5.0|Caitlin Moran is funny and wonderful. This book is worthy every penny and every minute you spend on reading it. FAT.
0307949486|3.0|I read this book because it was on the best sellers list and also because a movie was made from the book. It must therefore be a good read, right?<br /><br />Honestly I was disappointed. The book starts off fairly well, but I quickly lost interest. Half way through it gets interesting again, but again I quickly lost interest. I hated the last 300 pages or so! I was hoping for a much better ending and an unexpected twist in the storyline.<br /><br />What is so special about this book? I read much better thrillers, and the plot is nothing new -- a man who hates women and who tortures them before killing them.<br /><br />The writing style of the author is good, it is just with the storyline that I am having trouble. I was really hoping for a much better story!<br /><br />Of interest to know that Larsson died November 9, 2004 in Stockholm at the age of 50 of a heart attack after climbing seven flights of stairs to his office because the lift was not working. Soon after Larsson's death, the manuscripts of three completed, but unpublished, novels - written as a series - were discovered. He had written them for his own pleasure after returning home from his job in the evening, and had made no attempt to get them published until shortly before his death. These novels are what is today the \\"Millennium series\\". The author therefore never saw the success of his books.<br /><br />When Larsson was 15 years old, he witnessed the gang rape of a girl, which led to his lifelong abhorrence of violence and abuse against women. This incident marked him for life. The author never forgave himself for failing to help the girl, and this inspired the themes of sexual violence against women in his books.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|this book is a must read perfect for percy jackson fans i  love it full of adventure and action plus magic
B00846REIS|5.0|I originally read this book right after I read the Fifty Shades trilogy.  I was a little apprehensive about reading this book because I saw that some reviews referred to this book as a bad copy cat of the Fifty Shades trilogy.  I VERY MUCH SO DISAGREE!!!  I do see how it makes you think of that trilogy but Bared to You is amazing in it's own way.  I personally liked the characters of this book much better and it reeled me in instantly.  I just could not put this book down.  The author did a great job at keeping things interesting at every turn of the page.  I would definetly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great erotic read.  I have high hopes for the second book.

B000SZZIH2|3.0|I have never--over the last 40 plus years--understood the comparison between this album and anything the Beatles ever did. The only connection I can find is that they are both top 40 rock and roll bands but beyond this? I don't care what the critics and self appointed experts say. This is not a generation defining album, it is not the answer to any question. It's a good album but it widely misses what The Beach Boys were about. That it represents 'growth' on some level--OK, fine, but surfers and car junkies never actually grew up, guys who thought cuddling with a hot girl on the beach in the glow of a driftwood fire--we never grew up, either. Nobody actually wanted The Beach Boys to grow up. They had an astonishing run of hits in an era when you were only as good as your last #1 hit--and The Beach Boys had a few--OK--a lot. For good reason. In their prime, they did it right. I'm not going to get specific and document every word I say, because back then, it was all about airplay. Brian Wilson went toe to toe with the British invasion, he kicked Motown to the curb because--and most of you miss this simple point--radio, top 40 AM radio was all our radios got in those days. At home it was 45s, albums...in the car, it was Howlin' Wolf, Kenny Griffin, it was even 'El Grande' out on Long Island, NY, if that was all you could get. Hell, I think Don Imus spent some time slingin' singles at some dirkwater AM station. In the 60's from one end to the other millions of us tuned into AM radio to hear the next 'hot' song. The Beatles transitioned from AM to FM almost effortessly. While 'Paperback Writer' was tearing up the charts on AM, 'Norweigan Wood' was getting airplay on the college stations. The Beach Boys never made that jump. This effort was their trial balloon. It sunk like a rock--if that was the point.<br /><br />This is a good album. It's a very good Beach Boys album. But a classic? I think it was a mistimed ATTEMPT at a classic. You have to put yourself back in the time it was released. Then you get an idea of the disconnect between the critics and the listeners. The critics wanted the Beach Boys to grow up. The listeners and album buyers did not. First, it was MONO. We were getting access to STEREO. The Beatles recorded in STEREO. Not MONO. We had headphones. Mono is lousy in headphones. The Doors sounded great in headphones. The Animals sounded great--in stereo. You had to be there.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|A few head scratchers and &quot;oh...duh!&quot; moments, but mostly full of fun, satisfying little puzzles. Myst, lite.  Seriously low-key ending, though, so don't rush getting to the &quot;big ending&quot; - there isn't one.
B00004YRQA|5.0|This is splendid. I had to keep my PS2 running for two days straight because I could not resist starting one of my old favorites but I did not have a memory card. And bam this thing just shows up in my mailbox. Speedy stuff. Imagine the horror of me having to keep the PS2 running for THREE days? This is magnificent and I'm very glad. Plus there were some old save files of games I had never heard of so if I ever get one of the GTA games I'm set! (They were from March 2002!!!!!)

I went a head and recommended this collection to all my friends and colleagues, it was that awesome!!

B000002KYR|4.0|The 1980s were not kind to musicians who made their mark in the 1970s. Many (too many) attempted to incorporate 1980s production into their sound. Results were mixed, and even the successful attempts sound dated today. Then along comes a little ol' band from Texas that shows how it's done. ZZ Top not only incorporates synths and drum machines into their gritty Texas blues sound, they blow the lid right off and have the greatest success of their career! Prior to Eliminator, the band did experiment with synths in some songs, but so did a lot of bands in the eighties. But Eliminator is a full-blown 1980s production laid over a gritty three piece blues band and unbelievably it actually works. Not only that, but you can listen to Eliminator today and it doesn't sound dated. This really is a brilliant work of genius, and IMHO it's not even the Top's best album song-wise.
0425263908|5.0|I really liked this book (and not just because of the red-hot sex scenes, though they are pretty delicious) because its characters are complex, flawed, and trying to change for the better. What starts out as lust turns quickly into something more, perhaps into love, and honestly every single person in this story has been hurt and needs support and love. The author honestly portrays the mistakes we makes with those closest to us, while at the same time portraying the deep chemistry that happens once-in-a-lifetime. A great read! Much better than Fifty Shades of Grey, I might add...

B0058YPG2K|5.0|Each season and episode of Breaking Bad keeps getting better and better. I have never been so attached to a series as this one. I'll be sad when it's finally over. I bought the series in Blu Ray but very few of my friends have Blue Ray so they will have to buy it for themselves or wait for reruns. Season five is playing now and as soon as it is released I'll buy it.
B003WJ81MA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I love the internal and outer struggles that go on. The scenes are beautiful. So yummy for my senses and imagination. I definitely prefer the theatrical version over the director's cut version. The streaming of the movie was uninterrupted. Was a great movie night.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I bought the series in Blu-ray and each show gets better and better. This is the first TV series I have ever gotten so involved in. I will purchase the fifth season when it comes out and will be sad when it ends. I have been completely satisfied with every purchase on Amazon and this won't be my last.  I do not have a favorite season. Thanks.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Okay, I know the \\"HUNGER GAMES\\" trilogy was written for young adults.  But this not-so-young adult is totally absorbed by Suzanne Collins' story of teenagers dealing with life and death cicumstances they had no part in creating.  As if the first book in this modernized and expanded \\"1984\\" didn't grab our hearts and twist our guts into knots, book two, \\"CATCHING FIRE,\\" ups the extent to which an overly powerful government will go to control Katniss for refusing to play by their rules.  After all, this rebellious national champion is giving the populace ideas.  She is dangerous and that makes her and anyone connected to her targets of the government.<br /><br />Fast paced.  Emotionally charged.  Heart wrenching yet satisfying progression of Katniss' story.  Author Suzanne Collins pulled me so deeply into the story and the characters with \\"HUNGER GAMES\\" that I couldn't imagine what worse the government could do to Katniss and all the children of the outlying districts until \\"CATCHING FIRE\\".  An amazing read!
0553277472|4.0|Worth reading for sure, if only for some of the in-passing psychological commentary. Really accurate, and it touches on many practical issues most thinkers just decide to ignore (of the type, why are people not caring about what you say). He also anticipated issues (and solutions) of how technology would affect people's daily life and mental states before they were so obvious, having an unusually balanced take on the issue. All of this is mostly in the first half, the second half is centered more on hardcore philosophical points, and the author's concept of Quality. Those are ok, though I wish the connections to previous ideas were made clearer. Also, the explanation was somewhat mangled and confusing, this might be related to the psychological issues of the author.
031620157X|5.0|This is not a retelling of the old Fairy Tales.  This is a wonderful new adventure.<br />I found the story to be fast paced and suspenseful.  An easy, delightful read.<br />Connor and Alex were real and believable in this make-believe world and surprisingly<br />you cared about them.  I found I even cared for some of the bad guys too.<br />I hope Chris Colfer continues this tale.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This scientifically researched book brings to light the answer to those questions... (why, what?) Obesity is not about how much we are exercising, or how little fat we eat. It is about the large amounts of sugars and highly processed carbs we eat hour after hour each day. Staying healthy is possible if we change our diets. It does not take a lot of work. The rewards are great.

B00845PV16|2.0|I enjoyed the first Ghost Rider movie and was excited to see this one.<br />I was disappointed. This movie had a poor story, no character development and poor acting. It did not draw me in and hold my interest and I found my attention wandering throughout the movie. The special effects were well done, but they couldn't carry the show.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|Enigma really tried to do something new with Voyageur and, once you've heard all their albums, it's obvious that they figured out how to use the sound they developed in this album more effectively later. If you're not just trying to complete an Enigma collection, I recommend skipping this album in favor of the one that followed it.

B008EQIEWS|5.0|Aw c'mon. It's wrath of the Titans! What were you expecting, Macbeth? This is a surprisingly nuanced, triphammer paced rollicking actionfest of a talkie. When Sam Worthington falls from a hundred feet in the air, you feel it, when Aries hammers home a point with his bronze spear, you feel it, when Aphrodite gives the camera a long, soulful look, well, you get the idea. The cgi is JUST FANTASTIC and the basic storyline of Perseus caring for his son more than heroics gives the movie enough of a heartline so you don't get a chill in the air from too much meaningless action. All in all, I haven't been this willing to give kudos to a movie for a long time. Plus, the direction is fairly close to impeccable.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|If you are an avid Game of Thrones fan and, having finished the last available book, are eagerly awaiting the next in the series, don't expect this book to be as satisfying in the interim.  Most of the short stories are good but there is simply too much unnecessary autobiographical fluff from the author about his childhood and his growth in the genre. George R.R. Martin's writing has grown much richer and deeper than any of these stories, although the sparks of creativity and genius are bright even in these earlier works.

B00008L3NK|4.0|This is one of the long series of New Year's Day concerts from Vienna. It follows the usual, and well-tried format, and delivers the usual reliable level of Viennese prowess. With this concert, Harnoncourt makes his second New Year's Day appearance and, typical of Harnoncourt, he brings his usual somewhat analytical mind to bear plus an interest in items that have not been featured before.<br /><br />Included in these new items are two Brahms Hungarian Dances plus Weber's Invitation to the Dance which is one of the earliest examples of Viennese waltz time within a stand-alone composition. Harnoncourt himself has a considerable Viennese pedigree having been brought up there, having played cello in the VPO in earlier days and having direct links back to Clemens Krauss and knowledge of the music within the context of real dancing.<br /><br />As a result we are treated to a serious attempt to recreate the music within its original context in terms of tempo etc. Everything is clearly laid out for us to hear and the orchestra have obviously been well rehearsed to deliver this. What is missing, it seems to me, is the sheer sense of 'joie de vivre' and this can be picked up by the lack of the smiles and glances which normally flicker around the orchestra on such occasions. There is also a noticeable absence of the cheering and the more vocal expressions of approval from the audience as the concert progresses. Even an item such as the Bauern-Polka with its vocal contributions from the orchestra fails to illicit these responses and instead it simply comes over as particularly well-drilled.<br /><br />There are several short bonuses in the form of films showing the journey of the Danube, the trick fountains of the Hellbrunn Palace and the Chinese chambers at the Schonbrunn Palace plus ballet danced to the music.<br /><br />The recording is well up to the usual high standards of the Brian Large team with clear imaging and sound presented in DD 5.0, DTS 5.0 and stereo. This is satisfyingly full-ranged.<br /><br />In summary therefore, a good concert but with a touch of the didactic about it. I personally would have preferred more sparkle and spontaneity such as we have heard from Karajan, Ozawa, Muti, Pretre and Barenboim to name but a few. Purchasers collecting the whole set will no doubt find this sufficiently interesting to add to their collection but for those wanting an example of these concerts I would suggest investigating others from the series in preference. This is, of course, just a personal opinion from one who has purchased many Viennese concerts plus others by Harnoncourt in the past. I think a fair rating would be 4 stars - good but not definitive.atisfyingly full-ranged.<br /><br />In summary therefore, a good concert but with a touch of the didactic about it.

B001P3SA94|5.0|I loved this movie, especially the portrayal of Etta James by Beyonce.  The movie was realistic, based on the climate at that time for artists of color, which truthfully protrayed the way entertainers of color were abused by the recording companies.  In the end, I had to give consideration and credence to Chess Records, because had he not taken the performers under his wing, some would have still been delivering ice, or working in the fields, and more likely than not, would never have come to stardom.  I really enjoyed.
B005MJ883K|5.0|This is a cool toy that is very addictive!  However, it can be frustrating, especially for young kids as it mostly has to do with rolling a metal ball around a plastic maze. The ball can fall off easily and be discouraging for some.

I won't be buying any more books by this author.
0805095535|5.0|'Writing begins in the body, it is the music of the body...' says Paul Auster towards the end of his current memoir 'Winter Journal'. And so 64 year old Auster sets out to write a meditation on bodily experience both physical and emotional. He describes ripping his cheek open in a department store as a child, boyhood fights and a horrific panic attack in his sixties. He tells us of the death of a boyhood friend struck by lightening in front of him and learning that his grandmother had killed his grandfather. He reminisces about the twenty plus apartments and houses in which he has lived. His description of his reaction to the death of his mother is painful and poignant. While lying sleepless in bed he often has painful memories of the child he paid to have aborted, who would now be forty-three years old and have probably given him grandchildren. He ends with telling us how a musicless dance performance broke his writer's block leading to his recognition that 'writing begins in the body'. All these memories are ordinary ones but in the hands of such a skilled writer they become extraordinary ones. A thoroughly enjoyable read for the thoughtful.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I guess some people like these newer retro-thrash outfits, but I find them all painfully boring. This is what thrash should be. These guys still have it, still make it. Great guitar sound. Chuck's vocals are special. It's difficult actually singing and being brutal at the same time yet he does this magnificently. Modern guitar players can't write solos for s...h....i....t. Alex makes them interesting. they should stand alone without the other music, and it does. I've been into metal since the year 1984. Yes, I'm an older dude, and I've listened to a bit of everything. This is how it's done.

B007BVOF8E|4.0|As with other LeCarre books I've seen made into movies, there is much lost in the translation.  In this case, LeCarre's main character George Smiley is by nature undemonstrative and secretive - both characteristics difficult to use to move the plot forward.  Oldman does an excellent job with the character, and as a LeCarre fan I loved the movie, but others in attendance had trouble understanding and following the plot.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|There's no orginality. The characters mirror the characters in the Twilight Saga. The author added explicit sex scenes which is why people are reading the book.
B00498TQV8|5.0|The best adjective for this movie is 'understated.'  The plot is simple which provides a clean background on which the characters can be drawn.  Excellent acting by the main characters.  A poignant view of a harsh lifestyle.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|I discovered Zep when I was just twelve, the first seconds of whole lotta love had me hooked and they've been my favorite band ever since. I have gone through phases of not listening to zep for months, and then breaking out their catalog and rediscovering why I love them so much.<br /><br />To me Zep had an air of mystery about them, while they could slay you with riff after game changing riff, most of which have shaped modern rock as we know it, but they could also take an acoustic song and make you feel as if you'd been betrayed by the sheer power of it.<br /><br />They touched on many different styles and never tried to play beyond their station, but always tried to do what they did best. They were always trying to be creative as they could and seemed to get better at it over time. While most groups are struggling to stay creative and even together for that matter after 3 albums and tons of tour dates, they were working on what would become a monumental song, and ultimately a legendary album, Stairway to Heaven. While it has been well over played over the year's, one can't deny the shear accomplishment involved in it's power, sound, and relatively even today, as most groups can't craft songs nearly half as good after years of trying as well as having 6 producers and song writers help them do it.<br /><br />Crafting songs is an art form that overly technical players often lose in perfection, jimmy page understood this and that made his leadership of the band instrumental in achieving what they did. A room of four excellent musicians does not make a great band.<br /><br />While some may say that this performance is not their best, I couldn't say, as I was only 4 when they broke up, but it is my favorite, but that may be because it's the one I've listened to most. I've listened to a lot of live albums of other bands, as well as bootleg led zep stuff, and this album is polished for a reason and that was to appeal to a wider audience than just the die hard fans. Many casual fans do not always like when a groups songs do not sound exactly like the album versions. I play guitar and while most musicians try to get the music as perfect as possible, most would give up perfection for making it feel real. Although they did try and polish this performance, culled from three nights at the garden, to include what they thought was best, you are still getting a live performance of one of the most powerful bands of all time., and even at their worst they are better than most.<br /><br />Having said that,  I think for most Zep fans, it's a bit of a let down.  I  love some of the effects and remastering, as it does give more of an ambiance of actually being there, but to revert to using  some of the video versions of songs, was really disapointing. More than likely the reason was that the masters were in better shape for remastering.  My big  dissapointtment is the fact that on No Quarter they went with was the video version, which completely sucks the life out of what I  think is quite frankly one of THE greatest solos of all time, but more than just  Jimmy's guitar, JPJ is just brilliant as it builds up, then with a  sense of anticipation,  the guitar starts laying into  something that seems to talk rather than sing or wail off the strings, and  Jimmy's first few passages seem almost ethereal. All of this lost in this version, and it is cut together rather badly even though most of the original is still there, its missing so  much. To some casual fans who haven't listened to this album a thousand times since they were 12 they wouldn't notice, but hardcore fans like me are so used to the way it should sound, it's a bit of a shock.<br /><br />I unfortunately didn't read all the reviews  before I ordered this, so it does mean I will have to repurchase the original version, or try and find the ones I seemed to have lost. Luckily I think I still haven't erased the original version I have ripped on a SD or USB drive.<br /><br />Music is so personal, Jimmy page knows this, which makes me wonder why in the world he would even do this. Still an awesome album though.l, Jimmy page knows this, which makes me wonder why in the world he would even do this. Still an awesome album though.

B0084IG7KC|3.0|Surprisingly grim, gray and bleak considering the target audience, this is as close to dystopian as PG-13 gets. An inordinate amount of time is invested in world building and scene setting here, which makes for some great, functional locales, but also relegates the plot to secondary status. Jennifer Lawrence is well-cast as the brooding, bow-weilding introvert Katniss, but the rest of the cast underperforms - especially Woody Harrelson, in a role he was seemingly perfect for, as her pathetic, booze-drenched advisor Haymitch. Readers with a fresh memory of the novels will get the most out of this interpretation, which assumes its audience knows most of the finer points of what's going on and summarily neglects any form of deeper investigation. It's gorgeous, though occasionally a bit too eccentric (some scenes in the capital look like they were ripped right out of a Final Fantasy cutscene) and non-fanatics will probably find it too narrow and fluffy.
B005OK722U|1.0|Worst one by far. Doesn't even begin to match up to the first two. Is the hidden meaning in this that Americans are tame? Probably. Starts off with a twist in abduction then fails... They don't even kill anyone. The girl gets taken away and bleh, nothing. Nothing ever. Not even a glimpse of what might have happened. As for the rest of the killing, torturing and maiming... it looked as though it was made for television. The whole thing just stinks. Netflix it and save your money.

B005LAII3A|5.0|When I found out they were making a re-make of Total Recall, I kind of cringed.  This felt like a classic case of the re-make being a bomb compared to the original.  Honestly, this film is the best film I have seen since the Star Trek reset that came out a couple years ago.  Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel are awesome. Even though Collin Farrel is good in this role, Arnold is the only thing about the original that is better than the current version.  Absolute must see.

B001UN1KVE|4.0|There are not many things I enjoy doing if I have stayed home sick.  If I call in its only because my body is doing a dress rehearsal for the day I die.  I usually drink orange juice to pack me full of vitamin C, medicine to prevent infection, and a Mel Brooks movie to repair my spirit.  Space Balls is one of the many Mel Brooks movies that always cheers me up.  From Blazing saddles, to Young Frankenstein the almost carelessness of the humor makes for a wonderfully enjoyable experience.  Like any good spoof the jokes are of course obvious, the delivery borders on old Saturday night live episodes, and there are a lot of over used stereo types.  If you never found Mad Magazine funny Mel Brooks might not be your type of humor, on the other hand if as a kid you never liked Mad magazine than you probably don't find a lot of comedies very funny.  This movie is wrong in every way it is so right.  After 30 views the lines are just a memorable as they are the first time.  Monthy Python it is not and it is proud of it.  Next time you get sick and need a cheap and easy laugh, put aside your need to be serious, and allow yourself the joy that is space balls.

B002JVWQSW|4.0|Husband an I are huge fans of the show.  On a recent visit to daughter in Seattle, she mentioned that the people she works with are always raving about the show.  She is a very busy mom with husband and three very active kiddos.  So purchased the first season as a gift.  She facebooked after receiving the dvd's, that she watched the whole thing twice, and laughed through all of it.  Was so pleased that the gift was so enjoyed.

B0038ZITIE|3.0|I saw Sam J. Jones in the movie TED recentlly. They kept referring to him as FLASH GORDON. I first thought it was a joke but then I looked on Amazon and he was, indeed, in FLASH GORDON. I had to watch the movie. Now in FLASH GORDON, you are in for a total jolt until you're in on the joke. It is high class glitter and camp and it looked so cheezy and cheap looking. I wondered why a studio would do a high budget - cheap film. The costumes look like the are made of tinfoil and glue on some of the characters. Yet, there is respected actor Max Von Sydow and the evil Ming the Merciless. Even Topol and Timothy Dalton have key roles.<br />After 30 minutes of camp, I got the joke. They were TRYING to make it look camp..a step back in time to the 1936 serial starrding Buster Crabbe. Special effects were limited in 1936, so this version continues with the joke. With that in mind, the silly story and hokey adventure are fun.<br />The flying Hawkmen reminded me of the WIZARD OF OZ's flying monkeys. There is no explanation as to why every alien on every planet speaks perfect English and why the atmosphere on every location is perfect for humans. OK, we can let the facts slide for a fun and silly film.<br />Add in soundtrack by the ever enjoyable QUEEN and you have a fun ride of a film. The main problem is the movie is about 1/2 hour too long. The novelty starts to wear off and the movie gets tedious. It's a great film for a laugh and a look back at one of the original Super Heroes.<br />One of the bonus features was the original first episode of the 1936 serial complete with wire clearly scene holding spacehips in place in the sky. I am sure this was high tech for 1936.<br />Again, FLASH GORDON is not a typical super hero film. It looks cheap and dated but if you can overlook those facts, you can have some fun.

0375869026|5.0|The new book, Wonder, is a fabulous book for kids ages 10-13. With it you get the perspectives of six different characters throughout this book of determination and adventure. This book is about a boy with a deformed face who struggles to fit in with the middle school crowd. Kids at around the preteen age would specifically enjoy reading this novel because of its setting and characters. For example, the main character, August, is just entering 5th grade, his first year of middle school. The other main characters are in August's new grade. Kids at that age could better understand and relate to the situations described in this book.  In the book, \\"Auggie\\", (August's nickname) has to go through the tough life of middle school. He is teased and struggles to make friends, but eventually finds great friends in Jack Will and Summer Dawson. What stood out to me in this book was the plot. R. J. Palacio's story structure is very clever, from beginning to end. The thing that I really liked was the message of this book: To not judge a person by their body, but by the content of their character. This book is very grabbing and entertaning, and I loved it.
B0089LT8Y6|3.0|i'm not going to use a barrage of jazzy words to berate one of my favorite bands. a lot of work and dedication has gone into making the album, which is respectable. i will make a few comments:<br /><br />1) there is nothing old-school about this album; it's as much an oddity as The Ritual<br />2) if i want to introduce someone to TestAmenT, this is not the album i would choose<br />3) when i feel like listening to TestAmenT, this is not the album i would choose<br />4) i find it difficult to turn up the volume with this album<br /><br />but in all honesty, if TestAmenT was to poop in a CD case, which they may have as well done, i would still pay retail and add it to my collection.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|My 7 year old Grandson has been watching Jurassic Park #I for some time.  When he found out II and III were available he asked me to rent them but I couldn't locate in our local rental store.  I decided to check Amazon and found the Trilogy.  He was so happy to have all three and can identify all the various types of dinosaurs in the movies.  Since he has had a long term illness that prevents him from doing some of the things kids like to do best, his study of dinosaurs and these movies have kept him entertained.  I enjoy watching them with him.  Thank you Amazon for making them available.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the hype, this book was a HUGE disappointment!! I should have just gone with my gut feelings (as well as the bad reviews) and stayed far away from this book, because now I feel as though my brain cells and time were wasted for no reason. The characters are insipid, poorly developed and juvenile. It was hard to stay interested in both the characters and the storyline (still looking for that actually!), and I literally had to force myself through this book in the hopes that there will be a leprechaun with a pot of gold waiting for me at the end. Sadly, no such luck! So a few words to the wise and mature-minded, don't even bother!

0765316994|5.0|Ensign Andrew Dahl has been assigned to the Intrepid, flagship of the Universal Union. He's thrilled, until he starts noticing strange things, like how everyone tries to avoid going on away missions and how on those away missions, someone always dies horribly - but always someone of lower rank. Never the Captain or his three top officers.<br /><br />This book is amazing. Scalzi is lovingly poking fun at classic sci-fi television, making Redshirts a light and funny read. It is full of characters who are easy to care about put in situations that may not be believable but are at least entertaining to read about. The three codas bring the story to an unsurprising but nonetheless wonderful conclusion. Highly recommended.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know what all of these negative reviewers are reading, but this is an excellent book series.  It is definitely not adolescent(as one reviewer suggested)or unbelievable.  So what if the main character is a billionaire?  I was hesitant to buy these books at first because of these reviews, but my friends encouraged me and I thought I'd give them a try.  I found them to be very entertaining and a great read.  As a mental health professional, I found the characters' development accurate and fascinating.  I recommend that you buy all three as each book flows into the next.  Since this has been on the bestseller list and the morning talk shows, I guess I'm not the only one who likes them.  Yes, it does contain erotica, however, that isn't the central part of the storyline.  I highly recommend this book series!  Set aside time to read because it is difficult to put down once you've started.
B007EW9ISM|3.0|If you have a sensitive nose this may not be for you. The rubber smell is unbearable. Currently, the rubber smell stays on my hands and I have to wash my hands right after I use it. It's an above average stylus and I'm hoping after a few months of \\"airing out\\" the smell will go away.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I will admit, I bought this book based on the number of stars in the Amazon reviews and some sampling of the reviews such as: \\"a 'trust me and read it' book!\\", May 16, 2012.<br />And although the author exhibits good insight into the human condition and relationships, the arc of the story plummeted at the end and the result was disappointing, unfulfiling conclusion, as if the author simply got tired of writing and just wanted to end it all. No exclamation points for me with this one; I will be more circumspect of the enthusiasm of Amazon reviewers in the future.
030758836X|2.0|I had waited with anticipation for this book to be released and when I finally had it to read I was totally disappointed.  It might be generational but the language<br />was a real turnoff.  If this is the way this young woman writes then it is a sad<br />commentary on our reading public that seems to accept this as best seller material.<br />I happened upon \\"The Playdate\\" by Louisa Millar and found it to be much more<br />suspenseful and written without foul language on every page.  Gone Girl was much too long.

B0073XV2W2|4.0|I really really loved Daemon and Freedom. The philosophical angle to the books with lots of tech wizardry was really mesmerizing. This book is more like a mix of little Chricton(prey) and lots of Ludlum(pick a  book). Like many before me have already stated, the possibilities of such a thing happening is all too realistic. But, somehow, I was left with a feeling that some elements have been over simplified like the power source and the ability of these machines to counter the force dynamics of firing when flying etc etc.,. I'm probably wrong.<br />Having said that, let me add that this book is immensely readable. But, its not a five star book for me.
B001IWV030|4.0|Laughed out loud several times.  Pretty darn funny.  Great actors and witty quips.  First time I've seen Truman Capote in a film.  Did well as the villain.<br /><br />Believable plot? Of course, not.  Hilarious? Yes.  PC humor? NO -- heaps of Asians-can't-speak-English jokes.  Great cast? Yes, an ensemble cast of great actors/actresses.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't know what can be said about this series that hasn't already been said.  It's simply one of the best of the year, or maybe the last several years.  There is no risk involved in buying these books.  They are worth whatever they cost.<br /><br />All of the characters are well written, totally fleshed out, with a deep understanding of their histories, motivations, hopes and fears.  They are all flawed.  They are all heroic, in their own ways.<br /><br />The universe invented for this series is dramatically different from what you've read before.  It is also easily believable.  From the start to the finish, it is easy to accept the premise.  The first book is, by far, the best, but without the second and third, the series wouldn't have the profoundly moving, and lasting, impact on the reader.<br /><br />There are many large themes in this series, all of which have applications to our own lives and concerns.  These books are unique, which is why there are so MANY ripoffs out there.  Don't bother with them.  This series is the original one, and the best.<br /><br />Absolutely worth buying.
034580404X|5.0|Wondering when the next series will be published of this magnitude! I have friends that borrowed my books as I finished, but couldn't wait for the last one and purchased because they couldn't wait to see what happened next!

1612183956|4.0|In \\"Pines,\\" Blake Crouch has created an intriguing tale of mystery that will keep readers guessing till the end.  Crouch created believable characters to people the mystifying town he creates in \\"Pines.\\" Though, the main character, Ethan Burke, at times seemed a little off his game as a secret service agent<br /><br />Waking on his back in a field on the edge of a town called Wayward Pines somewhere in Idaho, Ethan Burke, a secret service agent, has no memory as to who he is or where he is; only that he is surrounded by mountains and a beautiful blue sky.  Try to sit up he finds he is injured and dazed.  With no identification, money, or cell phone on his person Ethan treks into the town looking for answers.  As bits and pieces of Ethan's memory return, the peaceful idyllic appearing town of Wayward Pines is not what it appears to be on the surface.  For one thing he just cannot seem to get in touch with anyone on the outside of town beyond those scenic mountains.  Although the people living in the Victorian style houses about town seem friendly enough at first, Ethan begins to wonder about the strange looks he receives and why no one wants him to leave.<br /><br />Crouch has written a novel in which the words flow with a tempo that makes the reading easy and enjoyable.  Also, Crouch easily conveys a sense of suspense within the mystery of the goings on in Wayward Pines. This mystery, science fiction, thriller will keep you wanting answers and therefore keep the pages turning.<br />However, during the first 100 or so pages (the book I have is 329 pages) I thought I was reading the script from an old Twilight Zone episode I had seen on television as a youngster.  This is not to say the novel was disappointing.  Quite the opposite, Blake Crouch's plot had similarities up to that part in the plot.  As I continued to read the plot soon revealed itself to be quite different from that point on and Crouch proved inventive by conjuring up an interesting ending.<br /><br />Crouch is not on a plane with King, or Koontz, yet.  He does show potential for someday being on par with them.  In summation this novel may not appeal to everyone, but if one takes time to read all the reviews I am sure many will decide to read \\"Pines.\\"  I give it 4 Stars; the final twist near the end (50 pages or so) boosted it from a 3 Star.

0143120530|3.0|Like many reviewers I was thinking that this book a technique manual, but alas it was not. I doubt if the author chose the subtitle \\"The Art and Science of Remembering Everything\\", but it seems a little misleading. There were sections that dealt in technique, but most of it was what I would call interesting filler, such as case studies of people with perfect memories or some with no memory at all, savants, and all of the other topics that one could think of under the heading of \\"memory\\". A lot of the book deals with the author's journey to compete in the U.S. Memory Championship (Spoiler- he wins).  If you're looking for interesting facts to recite to friends at your next gathering then this is the book for you, but if you want a serious book on how to improve your memory there are others on Amazon to choose from. Again, if it wasn't for the misleading subtitle I would have given it four stars.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|My fascination with mechanical watches started recently, upon the arrival of the beautiful [[ASIN:B007EHOAS0 St&uuml;hrling Original 168S.33151 Delphi Chariot]]. Of course, since I'm not made of money, my interest has to be focused on the more affordable models out there -- no Rolex or Omega for me.<br /><br />I'm okay with that -- there seems to be a huge selection of affordable watches out there.  After the St&uuml;hrling (which feels to me like more of a dressy or out-on-the-town kind of watch), I started looking for another mechanical, one that would be a daily wearer with a low price tag.<br /><br />I kept landing here, looking at the SNK805K2.  I think it's very attractive, a far more minimalist approach to the face than I'm normally accustomed to, but I appreciate that.  It looks as if it's loosely based off of a WW2 military watch, specifically one that I found with a google search that had the same number layout (minutes on the outside), same shape of the hands, and the arrow pointing up at 12 o'clock.  The brushed steel case is beautiful, and I love the green.  The red tip on the second hand is a nice touch.<br /><br />Accuracy has been excellent so far, but I'll need to update the review later once I've had a chance to do a real test.  If you do find your accuracy way off, it is possible to adjust it from a screw under the winding rotor (a welcome, if scary, option) The luminescent markings have worked surprisingly well -- when I wake up in the morning, I can still tell the time in complete darkness, 8 hours after the watch's last access to light.  The size is good, my wrists being a little under 7 inches around.  It does feel small after having worn the St&uuml;hrling for a while, and even smaller once I got my [[ASIN:B007H4P1CY Invicta 10494BLB Pro Diver Automatic]]. Regardless, it fits my wrist nicely.<br /><br />I'll admit at first I was a little disappointed that there was no way to wind manually with the crown, but I got over it quickly since I've never found myself needing it.  If I really want to make sure it's going to keep running overnight or something, I can take it off and shake it a bit.  Also, I do like the watch band but it takes some getting used to (it's a bit scratchy at first) and if it gets wet, it stays wet for a while. And while I love the finish of the case, I can see how it might end up getting marked up pretty easily (it hasn't actually happened so I might be wrong, but it just seems that way).<br /><br />All in all, none of the negatives are enough to warrant any less than 5 stars for a watch that costs under $70 shipped.  I'm really happy with it.yself needing it.  If I really want to make sure it's going to keep running overnight or something, I can take it off and shake it a bit.

0062206281|5.0|I have been breathlessly awaiting Zafon's next offering and the only complaint I have is that it's only 250 pages!!! My goodness the man can write, within a paragraph you are transported to Barcelona and the world Zafon has created there. If you loved the first two books there is only more for you to love here. The story centers around the hillarious Fermin Romero de Torres (I have underlined some of his best and pithiest comments for future use!) and an antique edition of The Count of Monte Cristo. There is a prison, a prisoner (you will recognize the name...), secrets, betrayals and some mysteries are explained. I won't go into the details of the story, for obvious reasons, just know that what made the previous episodes of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books series so riveting, is well represented in the third installment. The only request I have is that the next installment be a nice 700 or so page offering..it's always so depressing when the books end!
0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves this book and we gave it to her very early so the concept of going potty was familiar when we started training.  It's simple and has a bit of humor which appeals to young ones and it reinforces the reward system of undies.

I think this book lends itself to great discussions  whether with a book group or with high school students, possibly those who claim they hate to read maybe...you can discuss social class, culture shock, cultural differences, religion, leadership, economics, technology, altruism, and so much more and of course the question \\"what would you do?\\"  It was a very fun read and difficult to put down.  I cannot wait for the movie.

Despite the fact Shin escaped, he is trying desperately to assimilate to a world and ways so unfamiliar while struggling to work through his haunting and difficult past.<br /><br />North Korea denies the fact labor camps exist but Shin is living proof they do exist as many others have proclaimed as well. North Korea's vehement lies and violation of human rights is appalling and sickening. I found myself angry and sickened by the barbarity and torment Shin and others are and have endured.<br /><br />This book is a must read out of respect to Shin and for awareness of violations of human rights. I am humbled by this book  - the next time I feel as if I am having a bad day I will remind myself of Shin and countless others past and present that were/are faced with more than any one person should ever have to endure.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I cant believe I actually paid money for this book. Read the first 2 so had to read the last, but it was pretty bad. EL could have eliminated this book totally and you would not have missed anything. Do not buy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addictive and fun.  Even after you beat all the boards you can do them again to try and get a perfect score :)
B004LWZW8S|5.0|I have recently added this movie to my collection. Sound 5 stars, Video 5 stars. The movie is worth getting on Blu-Ray as all the special effects scene look amazing on 1080P.
B003UXPVLM|5.0|This episode of LOTS was very suspenseful! When the mysterious confessor confessed the Seeker I actually felt sad. I didn't know if they where going to be able to break the magic that confessed him, but in the end it was great to see the seeker back to himself and the mysterious girl live a normal life.This show continues to captivate and amaze me!
B000L53D4O|5.0|Bought this for my 10month old son.... he LOVES it. He pushes it around everywhere! My only wish, that there was a lock on the wheels so that we could keep it from rolling, when he plays with the toys on the front. Not a big deal though. My son is now 1 year old and still pushs it around everywhere.
B003TH41H4|5.0|The first time I saw Legend of the Seeker I was channel surfing, and as soon I saw the show I was hooked(I watched the entire first season in only 4 days). LOTS is a must see for everyone! The show really keeps the viewer engaged, and you are constantly looking forward to what's going to happen next. The actors and scenery in LOTS are great and really make the show what it is.<br />I really hope that they come out with a 3rd season!
B007M45PMU|4.0|Intelligent lyrics with a great beats I can't say much more. I'm into brevity not a slight of the album
B003UXPU8Q|5.0|The episode showed how serious of a problem the keeper is. With the keeper bringing people back to life and forcing them to kill people, the Seeker will have his work cut out for him! With every enemy killed the keeper becomes stronger! This show continues to amaze me!
B00846REIS|5.0|This wa s an excellent follow up booke series after 50 Shades series. i cannot wait until the seond book comes out in the fall.I've already pre ordered it you should get your too!
B003UXRZIY|5.0|It was nice to finally see the seeker get some time to celebrate, but not for long. Right when the screeling from the underworld jumped through the window and attack the Seeker I knew it was going to be an Epic 2nd season! I absolutely love this show, I hope they end up making a 3rd season!
B0063IH60K|3.0|the game would be a lot more fun if all the adds would not. be popping up when you want to start a new game
B003THAC9U|5.0|A great finale for a great first season! The finale leaves you wondering what Quest the Seeker will go on next. I can't wait to start season 2!
B006RUJST6|5.0|What made me pick up this book was the slam poetry aspect of it. It also helped that the brilliant author Tiffany King has tweeted it and I took that as a recommendation coming from her. I'm a poet and I'm a lover of a great story. This book seemed like a promising combination of the two.<br /><br />There are many things I enjoyed about this book. Many things. One WAS the use of poetry. It wasn't just thrown in there for the sake of having a poet as a character. Hoover was able to weave poetry throughout the story, in the classroom, at the slams themselves, and into the lives of the characters. I feel this was a strong part of the book.<br /><br />Going into the book I knew there's be a romance, but I wasn't prepared for this particular one. There was so much tension and risk and emotion thrown every which way that I had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen. There were also many curve balls throw into the mix that helped surprise me and add to the intrigue of finishing the book.<br /><br />What else should a book have in it? Characters, that's what. One of my favorites was Eddie. She was always fun but could be there to take charge when needed. And the poem she reads at the slam....you'll just need to read the book to know about that one. Kel and Caulder are also great. Some of the things they do and say made me laugh. Sometimes it was an uncomfortable laugh due to the situation, but it was still those two (especially Kel) that made the situations work out better.<br /><br />Let me tell you a little bit about Will. I can see why women would fall in love with him. He is just a great guy all-round. I feel that the author was able to make him \\"sexy\\" and \\"swoon-worthy\\" (yes, that's right..I said that) without having him gleaming with sweat and panting in a girls window while she sleeps. He was a real young man. I think he's everything a mother could hope her daughter finds and exactly what that daughter would want to find. Ok, enough about the weird man-crush...?!?!?!<br /><br />This book really sucked me in during the last half or so. The emotions from then on, the information, and events that took place had me flipping page after page and almost out of breath. I HAD to keep going. I was in the car for a 30 minute drive and when the car stopped I didn't know how I got to the destination. That's how glued to the story I was, and I had read almost half the book.<br /><br />Let's put it together like this: Before writing this review I opened up its sequel Point of Retreat. I had to force myself to look away after the first chapter in order to  get this review out. I needed to keep going that much, but I also needed to get my thoughts out about this book<br /><br />One last thing I can't leave out of the review. Hoover began each chapter with a quote from the music of The Avett Brothers. Their music plays a big part in this book and in general they are great musicians to check out. If you don't know them, I recommend you check them out.crush...?!?!?!<br /><br />This book really sucked me in during the last half or so.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|ice age village is a great game for my six year old daughter to play. I like to play it too! The game has lots to do. it is great for car rides as well as other play times. Big hit!
B0086700CM|5.0|ADDICTIVE  PURELY ADDICTIVE.  AND i AM 70 YEARS OLD PLAYING THIS AWESOME GAME.  THE OLDIES AROUND ME JUST SHAKE THEIR HEADS.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got this book in hopes that it would be better than the first.  I was wrong!  I kept reading on, as train wrecks are hard to keep my eyes off of...<br /><br />But, if you like erotica, you might like this.  I think it just wasn't for me.
B008ENNXQI|4.0|We thought this was cute movie! Julia Roberts is wicked and fun in this adaption of the famous fairy tale - and wait for the ending!
B007S1RGUQ|5.0|As I was headed to sites that streaming radio does not work, I wanted to make sure I had some tunes that could ease the time. Driving across country with only the buzz of air or other car sounds only works for a couple of hours of contemplation. Then I want something I can listen to, sing with, and be energized by - and Bonnie is the one to do it.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Easy, fun read.  If you watch Castle on TV, it makes the read even more interesting. Sort of interacting with the TV series.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|what can I say? it herps the derp for golf games and I can't believe I am still writing this review. here's my impression of hector salamanca. DING DING DING DING!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love this book, I read it when traveling if I'm not too tired and I can't help but laugh out loud at least every other page. I've been rationing my reading time with it so that I can make it last longer but I know that I would finish it in a day if I let myself!
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a book very similar to Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James. And although the beginnings are so alike I was beginning to get frustrated, Sylvia Day dives into the character development (especially with Gideon) and captures interest. All in all, a wonderful and sexy read that leaves you waiting in anticipation for the next installment of the series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|always wanted this and my friend has it on her ipod and now I have it on my kindle and if the boys are fighting I give them this and theyer quite
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great video and I was really seeing results until I injured my foot (unrelated).  Looking forward to getting back into it and I'm going to get other videos from Jillian.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The book was not as good as the previous two books. It got a little boring at times. A little disappointed with how it ended.
B006KDOD68|1.0|The Moonstone is the first detective novel (not to be confused with Poe's first detective short story) and for that reason, it's interesting to read.  But that's really the only reason.  By today's standards, it's slow moving almost to the point of being boring, and the denouement wasn't (IMO) worth the effort.  Gotta say though, the price was right!
B007Y37TQY|5.0|This review actually applies to all the seasons - the men are handsome, the women are beautiful, the plots are riveting,  the acting is superb and the writers of the show are absolute genius!  I know all good series must come to an end; but, I hope this one has an exceptionally long history!!!!
159448385X|5.0|Just finished reading the book and can't put my feeling into words. Undoubtedly the most beautiful story I have ever read. Also the most heart wrenching. The injustice faced by people in some parts of the world is unspeakable! This book is a must-read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is advanced and I love it. I use it every day,if you don't know, just listen and get the thing
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game cuz it has extremely good graphics. And its not one of those games that take like 5 minutes to finish. It actually keeps you busy. You can keep on unlocking stuff instead of buying them with real money. I suggest this game to anyone who has a brain.
B004UCYVC2|5.0|I really like this memory card. I got it super fast and it works great! I have not gotten a ' Error ' or 'Cant read card' yet, and dont think I will. Im glad I looked to Amazon for it. Great service and product.<br />Thank you!
0141197307|5.0|I already owned this book, along with Through the Looking Glass, but I just had to get this wonderful edition after seeing the YouTube trailer for the book: (...). Go ahead and watch it. I'll wait :-)<br /><br />Awesome, right!? I'm a complete sucker for nice clothbound books, and I love contemporary art, so getting this really was a no-brainer.<br /><br />The illustrations are amazing and they compliment the story perfectly, transporting adults into an imaginary world that's rarely available to those over two feet tall. For a story that's been visually adapted time and again by Western illustrators and filmmakers, it's refreshing to have a completely re-imagined view of Alice's adventures by this wonderful Japanese artist. In fact, the one problem I had while reading the book was trying to forget the movie adaptations I'd seen (particularly the Disney one) and instead allow myself to imagine it with fresh eyes. It took a little while, but I love the new vision that Kusama took me on through that timeless rabbit hole.<br /><br />In regards to the story itself, I was so impressed with how cleaver and imaginative Carroll is. None of the movies really do the story justice. I'm pretty sure that Carroll must have at least been an amateur linguist because of all the ways he plays with the language. Actually, thanks to my former life as a linguistics major, I got so much more out of reading this than I probably would have otherwise. While this is undoubtedly a children's book, this is a story for all ages.<br /><br />Whether you're a kid or an adult, this is a fantastic edition of a classic story. Rarely does a book make me laugh out loud, but Alice's adventure in Wonderland did just that - page after page. I can't wait to share this with my (as of now, nonexistent) kids someday!
0670021652|3.0|When I read Eat, Pray, Love, I felt like it was really natural. Committed, on the other hand, felt forced, like the author was trying really hard to get that spontaneous element back but it just wasn't happening.<br /><br />She has some great, inspiring points, but they are very labored. For the reader, at least. Man, I had to work hard to find out what other cultures feel about marriage. I'm not saying she should spoon-feed us, but maybe make it a little more fun to travel along on her journey.<br /><br />Overall, worth the read, but not the greatest read.
0756407125|5.0|Book two picks up with the same excellent writing and engaging stories. There are a couple of sections where I think the author spends a little too much time on a storyline, but overall the book was very good and I am eager to read book 3, whenever it comes out!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it its tollaty awesome u just have 2 get do it now get the game its soooooo fun
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I don't normally read fantasy books, but this one came highly recommended and I'm glad I heeded the suggestion. The writing is exceptional and the story engaging, characters well developed and not all too-predictable as most usually are. Book one leaves you eager to start the second, which is also very good.
B008CP93S0|3.0|I'm a Jennifer Aniston fan, but the movies was just alright. I wasn't expecting it to be an academy award winner... and it wasn't!! It was, however, entertaining. I was also curious to see the chemistry between she and Justin Theroux... and I'll have to say... there were some sparks!
B008KRJWEK|1.0|works for two days then starts to load and then it crashes need to fix this game do not get until they fix it
B007RFBLDG|5.0|This is the wierdest, most satirical, most brilliant high school comedy ever penned, let alone produced.  And yes, high school was a sad, awkward hell for me, so it's not because I can't relate.  This is awkward funniness that had me squirming in my seat as much as gazing at the screen in jaw-dropped could-they-ratchet-that-up-any-further? amazement.  but they do.  again and again and again.  And the ending, considering the evolution of the film, is absolutely perfect.  I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />one more comment: the 70's soft rock... oh man.  do i ever remember these days.  if i only knew how innocent we were!<br /><br />oh... and i'm not an SNL fan.  i've never even sat through an episode.  Occasionally I catch a skit here and there, mostly by accident.  Never really caught on for me.  I like a lot of comedians who came through the halls of SNL, though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Ever since I downloaded this app, I had played this for hours. This app is highly recommended. It can be difficult at times, though.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|got a little addicted!! it was fun and just easy to play my daughter and I love playing it together. She is five and loves me to read her the directions and then she does the task to reach the goal!
B005O64VH8|5.0|Secret Garden has done it again!  This new album is excellent and does not carry the characteristic \\"sad\\" or \\"melancholy\\" feel of Secret Garden, but is happier and more uplifting.  One of Secret Garden's better albums!
0307352145|4.0|Very good book. I knew I wanted to hear more of what Susan Cain had to say after I watched her TED video. I'm better able to see introversion as a gift as a result of reading her book. I definitely got a kick out of hearing anecdotes about other introverts who often had similar tendencies to mine and I realized that in some ways I'm not as introverted as I'd thought I was. She raises more questions about introversion and sensitivity than she answers so I'd be interested to read more books on these subjects.
B008EQIA7W|2.0|loved the original clash of the titans - hated the remake. still, i had high hopes for this movie. special effects were good but the story dragged and was bland at best. very disappointed.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy is a must read for any woman! I would recommend this to anyone to read, you will not be disappointed! Be aware- its addicting and hard to put down!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything I need it to. It has a great design and is very simple to use. Straight to the point.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This is a great read of near-future science fiction, fully grounded in today's trends of computing, finance, and government. Be sure to follow up with the sequel--FreedomTM; the two really read as one complete story. It is as fun to talk about the ideas set forth in this book as to read them in it.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I love this opera and I am not at all disappointed in this copy!  It is clear, the color is great, and the sound is perfection.  I will order other Webber operas soon.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|My daughter liked this movie when she was younger and now I watch it with my granddaughter! Its a favorite in my house.
0385737955|5.0|The maze runner is another awesome dystopian trilogy about a potential future where minds can be controlled via implants and nothing is as it seems.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have been buying my music from amazon for many years now. This is so nice as it is all in one place and I can access all the places I want it. Simply awesome.
074322454X|4.0|I really love how Ambrose took the stories of these men in the 101st and brought them to life.  This was just a small sampling of the greatness of our veterans and men of WWII.<br /><br />I think he really personalized the war, but introducing the world to these heroes. They all deserved the recognition for their sacrifices.  I think that it was well written, informative and I appreciate the fact that it went beyond the basic X's and O's of war.<br /><br />He humanized it and brought in several little side stories to bring these people to life.  It made it more than just some dry history book.<br /><br />I am not the pickiest of readers, I just like a well informed, well written story.  He shied away from the dramatics but kept me on the edge of my seat as I turned from page to page.<br /><br />I think this is an absolute must read for all WWII buffs.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the game. Only sad because expansion has not been released for android. My sister has it and I am getting impatient!!!
0316044695|4.0|This book was both tragic and heroic all at the same time.  This book went way beyond the scope of the events that happened in that brief period in the mountains of Afghanistan.<br /><br />Lutrell takes us through the entire SEAL training program, which in and of itself is a story.  I knew they wen through \\"hell\\" to become SEALS. I just never fully understood the full scope of that.<br /><br />My only draw back, though I don't totally disagree with him, is his portrayal and discussion and continual references of the \\"liberal media\\" as he put it.  I just felt that at the times he discussed them and shared those views,they really just weren't the proper time and place.  I felt a bit distracted and that it took away from his story and is heroics a bit.<br /><br />I think this is a must read for anyone who is interested in the combat and the SEALs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an easy read. Great for an airplane trip or when you want to escape to a different reality.
B005V2S7FW|1.0|I have this on my computer and it works well.  Also works well on my iphone.  flop in my kindle fire.  Not sure why. Maybe cause it's not a mac product?
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first I was a little disappointed with the book.  I read it on vacation.  Give it a few chapters it gets better.  The ending was great.
0062124293|5.0|Well, maybe it's not for prudes or the humor-impaired, but barring those demographics, I think all people should read this book. We need a voice like Caitlin Moran's so badly in this culture: funny, fierce, honest, pissed off, hopeful. She blends memoir, humor, and polemic in an eminently readable way. Yes, the language is raw, the details graphic, but that's how life is, and what the topic demands. She stands up to sexism in our culture, especially the pornography industry (aka, \\"the roiling Sea of Bull****\\") in a powerful way, and makes you laugh out loud while doing so. No mean feat.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how u can combine noises. this app is sooooooooooo relaxing. I am so relaxed. love this app. better than white noise
0061537969|4.0|While I am not much of a novel reader, my wife insisted I read this book because of the interesting narration style (from a dog's perspective) and because it contained auto racing references.  So I picked this book up with some trepidation and jumped in.  In the end, it was a page turner and I really liked it a lot.  It read easily, and the story kept me hooked.  I really liked the narrative perspective coming from the dog's point of view - indeed Enzo definitely was quite engaging.  It took me only a short time to read the book, which is always a good reflection on my enjoyment.  The racing references were spot-on and added to the interesting nature of the book, whether one is a car enthusiast (guilty as charged!) or not.  And the perspective around what happens to dogs after they leave their canine lives is priceless....<br /><br />So what prevented me from giving this gem 5 out of 5 stars?  It was the tear-jerker aspect of this novel.  While I won't spoil the surprises for those of you who haven't read this yet, I will say that the book seemed designed to get even the most hard-hearted among us to cry, almost from the very beginning.  There are a lot sad situations and tragic scenarios in the book - plain and simple.  And this is clear from almost page 1.  I'm sure that's why my wife loved this book!<br /><br />So, my recommendation is read the book!  It is well written and enjoyable, despite the hard-luck sadness that drives the story.
B007M6P01O|2.0|Season 1 brilliant... a zombie slasher with depth.  My girlfriend and I were riveted in a 5 hour netflix marathon so much so we opted to pay for season 2 here. Well... after watching the horrible implosion of the show in the second season I wonder if the entire writing staff either quit for better jobs or just made so much money they were too busy partying to care about the show anymore and what they wrote.  Any brilliance was long, long gone.<br /><br />This season was full of stupid exchanges, manufactured drama, and completely drug out... an entire season at the farm?  In the end nothing redeeming and noting truly dramatic<br /><br />Just one example of the rediculous writing in this episode and the season for that matter...<br /><br />Rick and Shane... the dramatic climax of the whole season.  Ok they walk into the forest in open daylight, walk into the night almost instantly (obviously and very cheaply more dramatic) as Rick says they walk and walk, the whole stupid exchange happens and then the frickin kid shows up to see it.  Really?  He leaves the house full of people unnoticed and walks a long way according to Rick and just happens to find them and at the precise time to see Shane turn into a Zombie, save his dad, make a perfect shot at 150 ft, and become a man at the same time.  Okay bad cheesy writing and very lazy, but how about this.... even thoug Rick says they are essentially miles in the woods and this stupid kid finds them they turn and walk back and the house is a few hundred yards away. Competely pitifulwork here guys.  Then the gun shot and Daryl \\"a tracker\\" doesn't notice and just walks inside the house.  1000 zombies are a few hundred feet away in the woods and dad and kid dont hear ANYTHING to alert them until they are right next to them.  They turn and magically see the lights of the house start running in that exact direction with the zombie hoard behind them and in the next scene they \\"are cut off\\" and have to run the other way to the barn????  Did 1000 zombies alone not create enough drama that the writers had to put in this garbage??? Did the one writer go to lunch and not read that they were heading directly toward the house with an obvious clear shot and put this in?  How about burning zombies that have to be hit in the head to die...now they are afraid of fire and just stop coming?? Rick sets fire to a barn and goes into a hayloft?? Really he was never stupid and why now.... quite simply and yet again poor and lazy writing.<br /><br />I could go on and on... the rally point, the gas thing, no supplies, a fire at night, a car big enough for the group, Rick's speach... all pitiful displays of writing.<br /><br />Enough... like the Walking Dead writers I'm bored and ready to do something else tonight, but please please AMC stop this.  I really enjoyed season 1, it was brilliant, but we were forced to watch 13 painfully stupid episodes hoping for just a glimmer of what we all saw there and regardless of what anyone says it never materialized.  Simply in episode 113 or so of season 2 AMC finally found some budget for extras and had the zombie attack that should have hit the farm 8 episodes ago.<br /><br />I obviously care or I wouldn't have just wasted 30 minutes writing this, but if it is not fixed immediately in season 3 I will write this off as complete and utter crap and enjoy watching the brilliance of season 1 over and over to get my fix of what once was.... good luck
B007WFTFG6|4.0|This is a fantastic item. put it on a tablet for my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter<br />She watched me a couple of times, and then she was of to the races, and having a blast<br />at the same time learning also
B00722ZIBA|3.0|This album is okay, nothing spectacular, out of all the albums they have put out, this one is not the greatest.
B0089IGUP4|4.0|Although on their fourth studio album, The Gaslight Anthem, comprised of Alex Levine, Benny Horowitz, Alex Rosamilia and frontman Brian Fallon, release their debut effort on major label Mercury Records. 2010's [[ASIN:B003FK8V7G American Slang]], released on Side One Dummy, was critically acclaimed across the board. 2012's [[ASIN:B0089IGUP4 Handwritten]], which recently gave The Gaslight Album their first top five album (Billboard 200, #3 with 40,000 copies sold), is definitely a consistent and enjoyable follow-up.<br /><br />\\"45,\\" the first single, opens up the effort energetically.  Loud it may be, \\"45\\" never sounds overwrought or overproduced.  Fallon's lead vocals sit atop the production with ease, delivering a nuanced, commanding vocal.  The songwriting is solid and the play on \\"45\\" (as in an old school record), is a brilliant, lyrical touch.<br /><br />\\"Handwritten,\\" the title track is solid as well, opening with neutral vocal syllabic treatment (\\"Wo oh-oh,\\" etc.). The drum groove is superb, highlighted even more by the timbre of the drums within the production. The chordal guitar is biting, contributing greatly to the rock sound.  Perhaps less satisfying than \\"45,\\" \\"Handwritten\\" is nonetheless above average for sure.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes My Man\\" continues the consistency, featuring acoustic guitar to give off a more folksy-rock sound (welcome Bruce Springsteen comparisons now).  The drums are gargantuan, propelling the straight-quarter note feel of the verse.  The song structure is simple, but excellent, highlighted by the lyrics of the chorus: \\"And all my life I never had a chance/don't you think I knew about all your pretty girlfriends/but I waited for you, gave you time to decide/but you never saw it from anybody else's side.\\"<br /><br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\" is a show stopper, initiated by a cool electric guitar riff.  Driven by a four-on-the-floor beat and nuanced, pointed vocals by Fallon, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is easily the track to beat at this point.  Other highlights include bluesy-sounding guitar on the instrument break - nice `shedding' for sure.<br /><br />\\"Keepsake\\" is another `keepsake' for sure, incorporating a fine easygoing, lazy groove.  A variety of sounds/sound effects characterize this cut, including organ and synthetic effects.  Another well penned refrain sells well: \\"And now nobody move this sweeper/is where I put you down to lay so I can live with it/and in my heart, heart, heart, there are these waters/where I put you down to lay, whiled I learned to live with it.\\" The Gaslight Anthem are on `autopilot.'<br /><br />\\"Too Much Blood\\" confirms the last sentiment, beating out the superb \\"Mulholland Drive\\" for the album's best cut.  A gargantuan sound initiates the cut, assisted further by gritty opening ad libs by Fallon.  The bass and guitar sound incredibly aggressive here, yielding exceptional riffs throughout.  Incorporating another sound guitar solo as well as another solidly penned chorus, \\"Too Much Blood\\" just may be on repeat `too' many times.<br />\\"Howl\\" contrast the mid-tempo grind of \\"Too Much Blood\\" in favor of lightening-speed punk, though with much better intonation as far as vocals are concerned. At only 2:05, the brevity is a selling point.  Basic and simple, the verse/chorus/verse/chorus map works splendidly without `knocking any socks off.'<br /><br />\\"Biloxi Parish\\" joins the elite of Handwritten (\\"45,\\" \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" \\"Too Much Blood\\" and perhaps \\"Keepsake\\") as one of the best cuts.  The tempo is slower, the groove more grinding, and the guitar timbre adjectively is describe as `bluesy.' Fallon's vocals sit atop the production splendidly making \\"Biloxi\\" a cut with few improprieties.<br /><br />\\"Desire\\" contrasts \\"Biloxi\\" with a quicker tempo, which is predictable.  \\"Desire\\" is not bad, though the formula is `tried and true.' Not too shabby.<br /><br />\\"Mae\\" is a stronger cut, again resurrecting a four-on-the-floor groove and truly confirming Bruce Springsteen comparisons.  Vocally, Fallon sounds exceptional, particularly on the chorus: \\"I wanna see you tonight/would you come for a drive/you can lean into me/if you ain't been in love for a while...\\"<br /><br />Closing cut \\"National Anthem\\" is comparable to Springsteen's \\"Devils & Dust,\\" at least in the sound The Gaslight Anthem is aiming for. Opening with acoustic guitar with no percussion and eventually evolving (inclusion of strings), \\"National Anthem\\" is appropriately placed and another victory for the band.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0089IGUP4 Handwritten]] is a fine rock album.  In an age where rock doesn't always characterize the forefront of a pop-driven industry, it is nice to hear an effort the likes of Handwritten.

B007L3BMGA|4.0|Wasn't that interesting at the start but when Anastacia grew attention and began attracted towards Christian and showing her sexuality and inner thoughts of lust towards him, that's when the story starts to unfold and becomes so captivating as they recognise eachothers lust for one another. Literally written in an informal but in an open-minded, modern day sense but with the twist of Grey's old-fashioned mannerisms and the trivial and rivalry of eachothers linguistics and quite amusing and entertaining to any audience of any age. It is overall, a man and a womans fantasies becoming reality all in a one with tantalising rules and guidelines which makes this a must-read for anyone who enjoys an intimate read for their own pleasure or who genuinely loves erotism.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|As a resident and protagonist in another work of speculative fiction, I believe myself to be fairly qualified to judge Wool Omnibus.  My world, best described by it title [...], also exists as a world subtly different from yours.  Allow me to say at the outset that I enjoyed Wool very much.  Let me quickly add, however, that I am ecstatic that I don't live there.  Wool is a sad, shrunken place, a place without air or color and defined by the drudgery epitomized by constant stair climbing and descending.  In this world, Howey finds meaning, love, and tragedy.  Visit for a time, and be happy, as I am, that you live somewhere else.

B002QE3CTY|4.0|If I didn't have a job and other life obligations, I would have easily read this entire book in one day. (And boy, I wanted to.)<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Thomas awakens one day to find himself in a strange elevator, which takes him to a place called the Glade, a large open field surrounded by stone walls. The Glade is populated only by other young people, and none of them remember their lives before they arrived at the Glade the same way Thomas did, one boy each month. As disorienting as his situation is, Thomas tries to figure out exactly what is going on in the Glade, and finds that it is surrounded by a giant stone maze. Each night the walls in the maze move, and there is a group of people, the runners, who explore the maze each day to try and find an escape route. But it's not as easy as it sounds--at night the maze is patrolled by a strange race of deadly creatures called Grievers. One day, a girl unexpectedly arrives in the Glade. And the message she brings with her completely rocks the community the boys have worked to create and causes them to question exactly what they are living for.<br /><br />This is a tremendously creative, intriguing and affecting book. A little bit Lord of the Flies with some of the dystopian elements of the Hunger Games series thrown in, the story is a little confusing to grasp at the start (much as it is for Thomas) but as it unfolds you find yourself wondering what will happen next, and many of the details will surprise you. Some of the characters are a little two-dimensional, but I found myself totally immersed in their situation. I'm so glad that the YA genre has become just as enjoyable and gripping for adults.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Many twists and turns. Very well written. It is one of those \\"love him, hate her\\" stories, always fun.  Bought another book by this author after reading this one.
B00846REIS|3.0|I read a magazine article that recommended this book because, I'm almost ashamed to admit, Fifty Shades of Gray was a guilty pleasure read for me.  The reviews for this book were pretty good, so I decided to take a chance on this one.  Big mistake- do not pay $8 for this garbage!  While I admit the quality of writing was a little better than Fifty Shades, the plot line is virtually non-existent and everything the characters do and say is beyond all logic.  You cannot connect to these characters or even care what happens to them in the end because they don't even seem human.  Eva is conventionally independent, \\"I'm going to do it on my own without my parents' money,\\" ignoring the fact that she lives in an expensive downtown Manhatten apartment paid for by her parents, she's a debt-free college graduate, her parents' towncar & driver are dispatched to her whenever she wants and she basically doesn't have a care in the world, other than being a tragic victim of sexual abuse.  She's now embarking on a co-dependent, physically, emotionally and mentally abusive relationship with a multi-billionare who was also a victim of abuse, although we have no idea what happened to him, because thanks to the non-existing plot line, this book doesn't go anywhere.  Just curious, did anyone else think that he had remarkably poor taste with his \\"jeweled decanters\\" and home decorations?  I kept waiting for him to whip out the silk sheets.  Ick.  What was the deal with Eva wanting to match her clothes with people around her (her boss' tie and her blouse being the same color during a presentation, thinking it romantic that Gideon matched his pajama bottoms to her silk robes)?  I wanted to gag every time she described his hair too.  Books like this are horrible- making women romaticize adolescent, violent men.  Look!  He can change!  Just stick it out with him, it'll totally be worth it.  My mark of a good book is one that you can read over again and still care enough to continue, still be rooting for the characters.  I finished this book in 5 hours (mostly because I had to keep on re-reading portions because I kept thinking, \\"Wait, she said what?  Wait, that doesn't make sense.  Wait, no one would ever behave like that.  Wait, what?\\"), took a breather and then read it again.  Didn't care one bit.  Waste of money and time.

Caitlin Moran has given me the courage to shout, \\"I am a feminist!\\"  Now if only I could get my husband to read it...

B0083GCK5G|3.0|The first time I listened to the album, I was disappointed because the songs seemed to sound alike.  I listened again and was more pleased.  However, if you are expecting the sounds like Kokomo or Good Vibrations,you won't find it on this album.  But I had to remind myself that these guys are no longer in their 20's and it has been probably 40+ years.  They still have the same amazing harmony as they had back then, only the songs don't have the energy/fast tempo as in the past.  All in all, a good album to have to complete your collection.
B0013AUF2O|4.0|Awesome, he is still king of pop! I liked hearing some of the how or why the songs were made.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This was a great book, regardless of age! A must read and I can see myself getting the rest of the series in the near future.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is inspiring. It has begun to change my life in some very deep and profound ways. It's easy to read, easy to understand. I'm sure all readers will attempt a change in their lives just to test the theory. You'll have fun and you'll succeed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This novel was disappointing. I wasn't expecting it to only be an erotic novel, all it was is sex and whether or not she should stay with him. No storyline to this novel whatsoever, I will not be reading the next ones.
B006HC9AVU|4.0|My past experience with this opera has been somewhat mixed.  I usually come away feeling as if it is somewhat disjointed, although I love the music very much.  This particular production, however, sits very well with me.  From the opening, there is a visual metaphor of the film negative, and the feeling that the operatic action is being viewed inside a camera.  This interesting idea is leveraged by animations that show the characters actions and thoughts, and provide graphical referents that help tie the various loose strands of the operatic action together.<br /><br />As for the music, it is performed extremely well by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro alla Scala.  It is delightful, lively, and very complimentary to the vocal talents (which are exceptional) of the principal characters.  Albina Shagimuratova's Queen of the Night is just excellent, and Papageno (played by Alex Esposito) is a delight to watch.  And Genia Kuhmeier's (Pamina) performance of \\"Ach, ich fuhl's\\" is just wonderful.<br /><br />I can honestly say that this is the first production of this opera that I have enjoyed from beginning to end.  This was a wonderful addition to my collection, and I am glad I have this particular production. I enjoyed this production very much, and it will certainly be viewed on more than one occasion.  Recommended!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|After a long series of disappointing movies that were made into books, this movie did not disappoint. Everything is not like it was in the book, but I LOVED the movie when I saw it. I will definitely buy this when it comes out, but probably not unless there is an extremely good price. This is because UltraViolet Digital Copies are STILL NOT compatible with iTunes, and I will not pay the extra money to buy something I will not use.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|I had a very hard time putting this book down, almost the entire way through - even forgoing my own writing to be able to read it. As a geek, it was awesome. As a lover of intrigue, also awesome. There were a lot of characters, and some of them you met early on and then not again for quite some time. But it wasn't overly hard to keep track of everyone. I was a little worried when the first five or six chapters kept introducing more and more people, but the relationships between all of them became clear quickly.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book was that even the \\"bad guys\\" had depth and you ended up being able to see their side of things very well. The good guys aren't all good, the bad guys aren't all bad, which makes for a very challenging read. (In other words, the book will challenge who you're rooting for and what you want to happen, which will make you think. The book is very easy to read.) There were two things that happened that I didn't *want* to happen, though I understand why they did and the fact that I cared enough about these characters to have a strong opinion about these things not happening to them really spoke to me. I'm curious to see how those two things are dealt with in the next book in the series, which I plan on starting very soon.

0345803493|4.0|The second installment of the Fifty Shades trilogy isn't as good as the first, but still a delicious and dirty romp of a book.  Fifty is a bit more soft in this book.  Don't get me wrong - Fifty is still hot and sexy but his inner flaws start to unravel thus making him more understandable.  Get your riding crops out people.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fantastically awesome free game except it seems (the Kindle Fire version at least) needs to delete all of your progress with every update and the ads can get a tad annoying.
0345803485|5.0|I am just going to say that I LOVED this book.  It's a quick read and no, I didn't read it for the sex scenes, although they are impossible to avoid.  I love the fact that Ana's inner thoughts are put to paper and you can laugh along with her at some of the crazy stuff Fifty does.  Five stars - read it!
034580404X|2.0|I decided to write this review based on all three books instead of on an individual basis since the three books basically equal one big book. First off, I cannot believe how much people are going gaga over this trilogy. It boggles the mind for so many reasons. Kudos to the author for suceeding where so many others have failed, and for starting a frenzy over the erotic novel(as if that were a new concept). But that is pretty much where my praise ends. These books are so unbelievable(in a bad way) that it makes me wonder if people read good books anymore. I held out reading them because I had heard the bad reviews almost as many times as I've heard how much people simply LOVED them. But in the end I gave in, simply out of curiosity.<br /><br />Not even half-way through the first book, I realized the only way to describe it was a young adult version of erotica. The tone, the writing, the plot-everything screamed Young Adult.  That's not to say the books aren't graphic-they most certainly are. But there is no imagination or skill put into them. The characters are laughable and predictable and utterly FICTIONAL. Simple plot goes: Extreme billionare hunk Christian Grey, who happens to love sexually torturing women falls head over heels for a simple, utterly naive twenty-somthing woman, Anastasia Steele who knows apparently nothing about sex(her own body included). She naturally thinks herself very plain and not very attractive but he, again, naturally thinks her to be so remarkable and gorgeous, with a perfect body, perfect skin, blah blah blah. Her best friend is of course gorgeous in every way and she is in a constant state of envy. That's basically it for the first book. There's alot of filler pages and repetitive words like \\"Oh my\\" and \\"mercurial\\" that it becomes quite annoying quite quickly and that's through all three books.<br /><br />Book two is a little better and has some semblance of a plot but then book three is back to being unimaginative and utterly predictable. Literally, there is no way NO ONE couldn't possible predict nearly every turn of events in this series, down to the very end. There is no redeaming quality.<br /><br />If you like your books to have characters like Christian Grey, who at 26 years is apparently a billionaire who does whatever he wants, can fly a helicopter and speak fluent french perfectly and gets whatever he wants and has the most perfectly sculpted body and is sooo handsome it hurts-well then this type of book may be for you. And if you like your erotica to include unrealistic scenes where Christian can make Anastasia orgasm at the slightest touch or at the drop of a hat and leave her in a quivering, whimpery state-then again, you may enjoy these books. As for myself, I think I will go and re-read Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty trilogy to get this one out of my head...
0307341550|4.0|I decided to read this book after seeing so many people talking about Gillian Flynn novels.  So, I bought this book and read it in one day.  It's not that thick of a book, but full of twists and turns.  Upon cracking this book open, I must say that it began a little slowly, or maybe it just seemed that the story wasn't going anywhere at first (hence the four stars).  But, as I continued to read, I got sucked in.<br /><br />Camille, the main character, is so flawed with vices I don't have time to list them all!  Through the book, we see that she is not the only one from her small town that is flawed and twisted.  Murder, alcoholism, cutting and a host of other problems are included in this book.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|Very enjoyable story, especially with HM Jubilee. I've read it twice and loved it each time. One reads about HM's sense of humor, and I hope if she reads this she is equally amused.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last installment of the trilogy is still hot, but allows us to see Christian become a bit more loveable as he and Ana work through a host of issues.  Yes, I know many people think this series of books are awful as far as the relationship that Christian and Ana share, but as one reviewer stated something akin to it's so awful it's good!  If you read the other two, then do yourself a favor and read the last one too!  I already miss Fifty!  Laters Baby!
B001R0KH3W|5.0|At 58, the ageless Stevie Wonder can still put on a great performance. Watching this blu-ray with DTS-HD 5.1 is like watching it \\"live\\". Except for a few grainy images from a closeup camera, the video and audio were otherwise excellent. I will definitely play this DVD again and again.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game and the different ways that the tiles are placed each time. I have not mastered a fast finishing time, but I am working on it. This game is great if your eyes are good. Don't get fooled some tiles look the same after long periods of playing!!!! Overall I love it, love it ,love it!!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is very addicting!  You run out of energy, like in 28 minutes, but it gives me time to get my housework done, write a letter or play another game while waiting fornthe energy to refill.
0345803485|1.0|So I never really write reviews but I felt compelled to write a review for this \\"awesome\\" book. I had a better time reading Twilight (which I couldn't finish by the way since it too become so irritating to read) than I had reading this book. It started slow and the main female character Ana really irritates me; she's so naive and juvenile. The repetition in the book gets on my nerves. I'm sick of reading about her blush, bite her lip, or squirm. She also climaxes at the drop of a hat which is really really really unrealistic. I have never met a woman who can orgasm so often! She even climaxed while loosing her virginity... Seriously, I thought this book was written by some virgin teenager writing out her fantasy man and fantasy sex life. I wouldn't recommend this book for mature audiences as it seems far too childish for me. Even the male character, Grey, seems way too perfect and unrealistic. He's not only perfect, but sexy apparently, and he never works even though he's supposedly a billionaire? I'm not sure how that adds up? AND, he's only 26?? Hmm... I don't think I'll be able to finish this book, its way too annoying and childish. Its very Twilight-esk but worse in my opinion; at least twilight was better written. However, if you enjoy reading what seems to be a teenage love drama, this book is perfect for you. If you prefer to read better novels and better erotica, don't read this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun game and easy to play. it is very addictive and I find it hard to put down. Runs good on my kindle and ipod.
030758836X|1.0|Worst ending and makes you feel dirty for wasting so much time on a sick twisted book. I have read hundreds of books and this is my first rating bc I want ppl to really know how awful. Read the last chapter and you will be better off!!!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|great read. have to read all 3 books to see how it ends.it has a good story line to it, it is not just about sex.
0345803485|5.0|Miss James created the most mesmerizing, emotionally challenged and intriguing man in Christian Grey.  This book took me places my sexuality never would have dreamed trying.  But the psychosomatics of the characters is what keep my attention.  I have read some of the reviews, which have stated it was juvenile writing, and lacks a story line.  That is simply is not true.  This is a story about how neglect and abuse of a small child affected this man until she, Anastasia, fell into his office and broke the shield around him and showed him how good it felt to love deeply.  I read all three books and everyone of them are wonderful.  I did not want the story to end.  I do not know whether I will see the movie when it comes out, I just really don't know how they could capture it all in a movie and make it as good as the books!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This is absolutely a beautiful, beautiful CD.  There is good reason that the Beach Boys are still at work after this many years: they really know how to do it right.  I purchased several copies of this at their concert, and after hearing it, wished I'd purchased several more. (I was very glad to see that I could purchase more here.)  I love their nod to God, recognizing Him for some of the things that many of us enjoy so much.  All of the songs on this CD are very beautiful; my favorite is Daybreak Over the Ocean.  Every time I listen to this CD, I like the song selection even more.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies Marvel has put out. It's a classic good vs evil movie crossed with the story of the underdog rising to the challenge. Good morales for all ages (really small children might have nightmares about the crazy red-faced guy). Only complaint was that I couldn't find a way to stream it on any service (amazon, vudu, etc). Had to goto a Redbox to rent it in blu-ray (which was waaay cheaper anyway). The production companies really need to get their act together with the streaming. Other than that, AWESOME MOVIE!!
1594202710|5.0|I took this title off the reading list of the Chief of the Staff of the US Army.  It is worth your time to read for the following reasons:<br />1.  If you are not familiar with China history and their system of thought, it is a good primer.<br />2.  This book provides insight into the critical time of recent Chinese history:  Mao to Deng with Nixon.<br />3.  It explains the strategy of western countries, mostly the US, in the engagement with the rise of China back to power status.<br />As to the production, it was well read.  However, I do not recall if they had disk beginning and ending announcements.  If they did, good.  If they did, I wish they had.  It is annoying not to have these additions to the CD.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I liked this book as much as work I have read by Brandon Sanderson and Patrick Rothfuss, which is saying a lot. I found the story captivating, and had a really hard time putting it down. The main character is interesting, fully realized, likeable, and human. The supporting characters are also fully developed, having their own histories and motivations, which may or may not be in the best interest of the main character. The \\"story-told-to-a-scribe\\" frame has been used frequently, but is carried off very well here. Other reviewers have mentioned editing problems. Being a bit of a grammar cop, this usually really irritates me, but with this book I didn't care because I was so engrossed in the characters and the story. I devoured this book, and I can tell that it will be one that I read again and again. I am eagerly awaiting the next volume in the series.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|This film recovers much of the Latin American literary genre \\"Magical Realism\\"... Getting into a world where death, in addition to being seen as natural, illustrates that we need not be as painful as many of us have thought, but it is the way to a new form of evolution of the human being...
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I had heard of this due the movie coming out so I wanted to read the book first. This was such a good story. It was heartfelt, funny. I re-read it twice I just fell in love with the characters in this book.
1936594234|5.0|An excellent book, detailing the power everyone has within. This book is one that I will definitely read over and over. Very informative. I have already begun reading more of this author's works!
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This movie was the very best I've ever seen. It's also one that the family can watch. Hard to believe that the guy really accomplished what he did.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I found this movie very thought provoking and emotionally moving. The special effects, Directing and acting was outstanding. I would fully reccomend this movie to anyone who cherishes the love and bond that can form between a human and any kind of animal.
B007UXT6O6|4.0|It's been a month or more since I watched this movie, and it's really stuck with me like few other movies in recent memory have.  It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea, of course -- its pacing is slow and deliberate, and it doesn't have much in the way of a traditional plot.<br /><br />It merely follows the personal life (with brief glimpses of his professional life) of a man who's trying to juggle his work, his dysfunctional relationship with his sister, and his excessive, uh, lustful compulsions.  It felt like one of the most honest and topical movies I've seen in a long time.  We live in a culture that's obsessed with sex.  Now that computers and high-speed internet have become commonplace, the majority of adolescent and adult males consume pornography on a regular basis.  This movie, unlike just about every other movie that's come out of Hollywood over the past 3 decades, focuses on the dark reality of modern sex, and how compulsively seeking sexual gratification can lead to serious problems and even misery.  Fassbender and Mulligan both give excellent, emotional, memorable performances in the process.<br /><br />If any of the above sounds like something you'd be interested in, then I'd enthusiastically recommend this movie.  If you need a traditional plot structure or constant action to maintain your interest, then look elsewhere.
034580404X|5.0|I am so hooked on this book and plan to read all of them in the series.  I am an avid reader of James Patterson but now I am a E.L.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got the Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener to sharpen my kitchen knives and sewing scissors. As soon as I got it I used it on a kitchen knife and in less than a minute my favorite knife (we all have one) was back to its cutting glory. I started to go through the house and sharpen everything with a blade.<br />If you have shaky hands this isn't for you. The sharpener needs a good grip on it while sliding the blade. The carbide is handy for standard blades. Are handy for knives than have dulled a lot, and the ceramic is good for finishing or maintaining undamaged blades.<br />The diamond rod was what sealed the deal with me. I have a hard time keeping scissors razor sharp. Regular v pattern sharpeners don't work well enough, special scissor sharpeners don't get them sharp enough, but by using the diamond rod, I can get them razor sharp. It only took me a minute or two to get the hang of it.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|As a vegetarian and geriatric distance runner, I was delighted with this book by a renowned vegan ultra marathoner. His personal journey is told without limits - the same way he runs. The recipes I have tried thus far have been terrific.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as the first book, but it was still entertaining and kept the story alive. Such a quick and easy read, it's hard to say no.
B0046MVVOW|5.0|I just recently bought this 2 disk c.d. by Ke$ha and listen to it all the time. I wish I had bought it sooner! Rarely am I able to listen to cds all the way through, but with \\"Animal\\" and \\"Cannibal\\" I'm able to listen to them completely, without skipping! \\"Go insane go insane throw some glitter make it rain\\", and buy this cd! :) You won't regret it!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter is an amazing movie! In 3D it's even better! In my opinion it's a must have if you are into sci-fi or action/adventure!
1608871045|5.0|Had to leave it in the package because my husband is nosy and this is one of the first of MANY Christmas gifts. I got a chance to browse through this while I was at Barnes and Noble and I love the quality. I'm sure he will love it.
B004SBULWE|4.0|it does what it is suppose to do and it comes in handy when i need i would recommend and have to friends
0446547573|2.0|This book has a fair story but it's written in such a juvenile manner I can't even finish reading it. There's not anything in it that couldn't have been written by a 6th grader.<br />Sparks seems to have good ideas for plots but his execution is poor.<br />I'll never buy another one of his books and I feel ripped off by this one.<br />I'm not into Harlequin style books and this book made me feel like I was in \\"Harlequin hell\\".
0062082353|4.0|I enjoyed this person's take on his experience with war. I believe he is a special breed and this country is better off because of people like him. I will say that I will never look at a beach ball the same way after reading his account of that story. I have shared that with many friends.<br /><br />It does shed light on the feelings the soldiers had during war about their actions and the actions of their superiors. You will not read about that in the mainstream news.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|This movie is perfect on a rainy day. Very warm nostalgic entertainment; reminding me of movies I enjoyed very much as a kid, which are still movies I enjoy today.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very impressed with this app.  Easy to use.  The percentage key is great.  I'm going to see if I can get this on my droid.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|A good Avengers flick. Effective World War II background for the story: the villain was over the top, but of course this is based on a comic book. I liked the suspended animation twist -- don't know if that was part of the comic books or not. All I knew of Captain America before the movie came from a cartoon series back in the 1960's, which had the theme song, \\"When Captain America throws his mighty shield, all those who oppose his shield must yield...\\"
B008MEM24S|5.0|Lots of fun but you have to think as well! I do believe Phineas &amp; Ferb may have invented some of these!
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Nice looking watch, I like the automatic winding mechanism. It loses about 2 minutes a week. Face is easy to read day and night, as well as the date.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was like a run away train. It's unstoppable and you know it's going to jump the tracks but you can't look away. I could NOT put this book down!<br /><br />This one is my new favorite guilty pleasure. Why a guilty pleasure you ask? Well, I'll try to explain. This book reminded me of how, when you're in the checkout line at the grocery store, and you pick up a Star Magazine, you know the stories aren't true, but you want to read it anyway. This book is like that. The relationship between Abby and Travis is so volatile and unhealthy in so many ways but I couldn't stop reading it. I couldn't divert my eyes.<br /><br />Individually, they are unstable. Their childhoods, although very different, have left scars and impaired their ability to create meaningful relationships. Travis is a bit neanderthal, jealous and hot-tempered, extremely so. Abby's distant, hesitant and not truthful about her feelings. She creates a string which she pulls at will, pulling Travis closer and then leaving him without explaining why. The relationship is a roller coaster ride of emotional ups and downs. Together, not together, together again, not together again. So much draaaamaaa!<br /><br />The \\"action sequences\\", for lack of a better term, Travis's underground fights and Abby's experience with the underbelly of Las Vegas, make the story more interesting and breaks up the monotony of relationship angst and the boring parts of college life.<br /><br />My least favorite parts of this book involved the supporting characters. Abby's best friend, America, is just whiny and unlikable. Shep, Travis's roommate/cousin/best friend, seems unmanly and weak compared to Travis.<br /><br />This isn't my typical read but it was entertaining and addicting. I gave it 4 stars because I wouldn't hesitate to read it again. I'm not surprised that Warner Brothers has acquired the film rights. It will make a great movie!<br /><br />This book was provided for review by the publisher.
B000W93CHC|4.0|One gets a wonderful understanding of what life was about in the middle ages. There is a little too much of the perils of Pauline feeling as the characters go from one catastrophe to another.
B0086700CM|4.0|its so much fun it takes lot of fast thinking so it can confusing. Also sometimes when you try to jump it will turn or the over way around
0345803485|1.0|This book presents an adult subject written at a juvenile level, filled with trite and superficial prose.  Don't waste your time or money -- the writing is just awful.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is awesome it really has worked for me and my family I would suggest it to anybody I know.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|normally when you buy this from the store you get the air bubble pusher thing, a spray to help adjust the screen protector, and a lot more. all i got was the back and front protector and that's it. i could have just gone to best buy for the same price and they would have even out it on for me for the same price. very upset and probably returning for a refund.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is a got to have because it is a good and fun time waister . so fun and makes u deep thinking and is good for keeping ur brain smart over the summer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because it is so fun and addicting! it can keep me entertained forever. its difficult at first though!
9889979942|3.0|Based on the thumbnail image of the book's cover, even with the hot woman and the tasteful design, and knowing only it was some kind of photographic spread on China, I feared \\"coffee table book\\" - or worse, cheesy Chinese variety that would actually mar my coffee table, the sort you can find in the tourist bookshops with washed-out reproductions, incoherent English and sappy token displays of ethnic minorities dancing in their costumes.<br /><br />The actual book, once in my hands, is unlike any other book I've seen, including those in the photojournalism genre. It has a surprisingly small trim size of only 6 x 6 inches, but at 638 pages and over 2 inches thick and weighing almost 3 pounds, it's not a small book (and probably better suited to hardcover than its fragile paper binding). The weight is legitimated on the inside with the high-quality paper stock and what I'd guess approaches 1,000 high-resolution photo reproductions, capturing the author's two years of traveling to every province of China frequently under spartan and the roughest of conditions. Each province is prefaced with a map and a concisely written pitch, along with beautifully succinct, haiku-like captions for many of the photos, demonstrating that the author's skills as a photographer are matched by appropriate writing talent. The descriptions and the variety of photographic subjects - rural and urban landscapes, ordinary daily objects transfigured by the camera, and lots and lots of unforgettable people - seem to form a narrative that pulls one along the lengthy book, though most readers will probably prefer to dip into it at random than go through the whole thing at one shot. Regardless, it fulfills its evident purpose in being a comprehensive and enticing introduction to the country for people who haven't been to China, and equally interesting as well for those conversant with the country (I myself have lived in China for 13 years).<br /><br />Now for a more critical angle. The gold standard of \\"intrepid\\" or \\"hardcore\\" photojournalism books and one that will probably never be equaled is surely [[ASIN:8798170201 American Pictures: A Personal Journey Through the American Underclass]] by the Dane Jacob Holdt. Holdt arrived in the US in 1971 with $40 in his pocket and spent the next 5 years hitchhiking over 100,000 miles through 48 states and living with 350 families, taking 15,000 photos (selling his blood to buy film) and culling them down to 700 in his book, which are balanced by a substantial and moving narrative of his encounters with the many people he met, delving into their lives with a shocking empathy and intimacy (often sleeping with both women and men to dialogue at the deepest human level), and unflinchingly capturing with his lens the most horrific but sympathetic images of poverty and decrepitude.<br /><br />Personally, I would like to see the Chinese equivalent of Holdt's book. I suspect Tom Carter may even have witnessed some such darker scenarios or ruder encounters with people and made an understandable strategic decision not to include them, inasmuch as he seems to be positioning his book at the more \\"polite\\" end of the photojournalism spectrum, calibrated not to ruffle any feathers in China, where only the positive side of things tends to be presented. Thus he does not refer to himself in the first person but adopts the \\"objective\\" reportorial \\"the author,\\" and when he almost dies during extreme weather on the 5,600-meter Drolma-La pass if it weren't for \\"a Ngari pilgrim woman\\" who \\"appeared as my own private Tibetan goddess of mercy, literally carrying me the remainder of the spiritual circuit,\\" that's all we're told. I want more; I want to hear the dark side of travel and see the underbelly of the country, not just the picture-perfect promotional product. The author is certainly qualified to do this, and I invite him to consider these possibilities for another project.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I ordered this backpack, thinking it looked like what I would need for my Nikon D80 plus 70-300mm lens attached.  I intended to hike on the Outer Banks of the North Carolina coast to photograph their wild ponies.  This backpack is the most comfortable, most balanced, has plenty of pockets for camera stuff and personal stuff as well.  It is well worth the money considering the same type of backpack in well known brands, bring 79 dollars and more!  It is just as good, if not better!  Thank you Amazon for such a great product!
B00729Z6R4|5.0|New singer, new cd and the result is their best album. Very very good mixing of the  European and American HARD AOR style. This cd makes you travel back in time to the decade of the 80's and early 90's with a sound of those times. All the songs on the album we could put in some action movie of those decades (Cobra, Top Gun, Over the Top,Days of Thunder...). Guitars and melodic voice with a good production in the service of one of the best melodic Rock works I've heard lately. Recommended
1936891026|5.0|One of the best books to have in any writer's arsenal whether you're just starting out or been at it forever. Written in concise and no holds bared language tht no only informs and directs but will have you smiling.
0316044695|5.0|As much as this book broke my heart, I loved learning about the process it takes to become a Navy Seal and the absolute selflessness that they have.  The men of operation redwing will never be forgotten.  I am truly grateful for their sacrifices to defend my freedom.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I like Ane Brun, Adele and was told Kembra was good as well.  My sources were correct. I also like another Aussie, Andrew Bird.  Love good music which I get from Amazon
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was initially drawn in by this book and speed-reading until the end.  Unfortunately, the darkness of the book just took over at that point.  Amy as a character simply becomes too much for this reader.
B005KQVDH8|5.0|needs some parental review before exposing to the very young (language and scariness), but for older kids this is a classic, with lots of humor and scary parts, and eye-popping imaginative imagery.  Made before all of the super duper FX in movies these days, it still brings lots of entertainment and suspense into a well-made PG-13 type of movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Finally the story came to an end.<br />The end is a little weird because it comes back to the beginning and<br />now from the view of Christian Grey. I am not sure if I liked that so much.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|super fun never played something like this before fun for all ages! wishing could earn coins andnnot have tospend moneythough and wait timestake forever onsk.e animals. but very fun for free... graphics are amazing
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|the ending is both sad and sweet it just makes me cry when i read again and again.but i totally recomend every one to read this book if you havent. actually i recomend every one to read all the books if you have not and if you have dont eva stop reading these books eva.but any who i cant wait for the house of hades to come out im sooooooooooo... excited.;)
B0081L37Z0|1.0|If I could give this movie zero stars I would. I have never taken the time to write a movie review because I generally enjoy most movies. I decided because this movie was so bad, if I could spend 5 minutes writing a review to hopefully prevent someone from wasting 90 minutes of their life, like I did, it would be worth the time. Please don't waste your money. I rented this because I was a fan of the tv show. This is the worst remake of any tv show I have ever seen. If you enjoy throwing your money away, why don't you waste your money on the lottery or some scratch tickets instead of this movie. The odds of you winning money with your lottery tickets are about as good as you actually enjoying this movie...about 1,000,000 to 1.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|Not the type of movie that wins awards, but a great movie to watch.  I rented this movie and watched it twice back to back and then a third time in 24 hours.  The story is solid, and acting very good.  Effects don't look fake.  Just a fun action movie.
0345803507|1.0|So, after ploughing my way through the first two books, I thought I might as well go the whole hog and read this one. To he honest, I wish I had just googled the storyline and not wasted my money on this crap. There should be a picture of this book in the dictionary under the word \\"Repetitive\\" and/or the word \\"Boring\\". Every single chapter sees Christian and Ana arguing, then having sex, arguing, then having sex. Lather, rinse, repeat. I swear to god, did E.L. James even go back over her work and read it???? The book is full of the same phrases (oh my, holy crap, holy sh*t, you must eat, etc.), the same actions (Ana rolling her eyes, biting her lip) and I nearly wanted to punch that bloody Inner Goddess and her arch nemesis, Subconcious.<br /><br />At times I just couldn't take it anymore and had to skip chapters, and I NEVER skip chapters in books. Even if I don't like them, I will usually just stick it out, but this one was just so mindnumbingly dull I couldn't take it. I even read it one night to help myself fall asleep.<br /><br />Please don't waste your money on this. Goodness knows why it's so successful. I wouldn't have given it any stars but I can't publish this review without one! Grrr!
B008N1V11U|5.0|One word amazing. Awesome about 8-9 hours of gameplay. It does cost a lot but worth it. Over all a great app.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case is awesome. It takes awesome underwater pictures. It's really nice cause I can text in the pool, shower, and bath tub and not have to worry about my phone getting messed up. But only complaint I have is I ripped the back cover cause its kinda hard to take off, but I fixed it with some tape but other than that it really is completely safe to use I the water.
B008EQIK90|4.0|Saw this movie at the theatre and had to watch again.  Just as funny the second time, if not funnier.  Pick up on a lot more of the jokes.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I think Chris Brown's last album F.A.M.E. was a little bit better, but I still love this album just the same.  I have been listening to it for a month straight and I'm still not sick of it!
