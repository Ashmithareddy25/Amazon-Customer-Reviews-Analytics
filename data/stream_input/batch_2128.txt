1439130833|5.0|Okay. I got the book yesterday (2/11/12) and finished it today (2/13/13). I really found it inspiring and hopefully it will be instrumental for me in remembering the keys to asking for a change in my life as I am transitioning with different circumstances in life, like all of us. However it can be a successful move to the person needing them. I recommend reading it to all who need a change in life. You can't go wrong.
B007N5YY2K|1.0|The movie was so slow and most characters are so ridiculous. This extended preview doesn't represent the movie at all!
1594487154|5.0|Dan Pink blew me away with his first book, A Whole New Mind. In that book, he talked about how the ability to connect with other people is one highly valued skill that will never be automated or outsourced. I've been in professional sales since 1982 and this observation validated all the time and energy I've dedicated to being better at my craft - selling.<br /><br />Immediately after finishing A While New Mind, I sent Dan an email to not only thank him, but to share some additional insights about the profession of selling and how important those skills will be to the future of our economy.<br /><br />Little did I know that 7 years after writing A Whole New Mind, Dan would not only write a book about selling, but he would write it with even more insight than A Whole New Mind.<br /><br />I've read well over 100 books on the subject of sales and To Sell Is Human is the best one I've ever read. That's not to say many of those other books weren't good because most of them were. But, the profession of selling has dramatically changed over the last 10 years. The game has changed and we needed a new game plan. To Sell is Human provides that game plan and it's a good one.<br /><br />Dan is right. Instant access to information and social networking has put the buyer in charge. The buyer now knows as much or more than the seller. Unless the seller adapts to this new reality, they become obsolete. However, if the salesperson learns to adapt to this new reality the role of the seller can be more useful and important than ever before.<br /><br />Once again, thank you Dan Pink for helping us see things as they are and for giving us a road map to a brighter future.
1582701709|5.0|The book is the key, the CD is the lock and the Daily Teachings is the door. I found all of them to be intertwined and they evolve one from the other. I thank Mr. Steve Harvey, from his radio, and tv talk show for sharing this book. I feel so elated and sanctified! Blessings, blessings, blessing!:-]]
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|Hated it. Was this book written by a 6th grader? I wouldn't have even finished this if it weren't our book club selection
0062127241|3.0|Liked to hear about the Townsend memories; thought his writing was dry and relatively uninteresting (which is going some for a musician I like as well as him).  It was more of a treatise on who he is in his head than much on what actually happened.  Not crazy about it, but interesting.
B009B2VBWE|5.0|We are Diana Krall fans and although this is different then her past albums it's nostagically entertaining. Authentic retro arrangements take us into the 20's and 30's for a look into the music past. Fire it up and let your mind float back through time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just had a baby six months ago and was feeling awful about my weight.  I am still carrying the 20 lbs I gained, but up till this point, didn't have the energy, drive, or time to exercise.  On Monday (2/11/13), I decided, enough was enough.  I can devote 20 minutes to myself in order to get my body back in shape, my cholesterol and triglycerides down, and get my self esteem back.  Today is Thursday (2/14/13) and I've lost 4.6 lbs.  Happy Valentine's Day to me :)  Even if this is water weight, I have to start somewhere.  I'm sure this is not typical weight loss for less than a week, or maybe it is?  I would highly recommend this video!!!!!!!
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|I was very pleased with the product and with the speed of delivery.<br />I like the special editions from Amazon as digibook, Steelbook, and boxes.<br />I recommend to fellow film buffs.<br />Sorry I'm using google translator.<br />thank you
0395389496|5.0|This seems like a must buy for eery child.  Our kids are still a little young for it, but i think they will grow to love it.  Really pretty illustrations and lovely story.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|What can I say?  It's Drive Angry, and it's in 3D!  I loved it in theaters, I love it at home... This, along with Dredd 3D and Shoot 'Em Up, is among my favorites.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|It has a good difficulty progression, for a fun time. I recommend t h is game for those who like to play the good and the bad.
B005LAII80|5.0|I loved it in theaters, and I love it at home as well.  Dredd was FAN-FREAKIN-TASTIC, and the 3D still works at home.  I've already watched it several times since I got it.

B0074PNCRM|5.0|You know that this book is going to tug at the heart strings by reading the blurb, but this one obliterated me.  Hot tip: don't read on public transport if you don't want to blubber in front of total strangers.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|good story with lots of historical details -- story is somewhat predictable but is still entertaining -- acting is great and set detail is interesting
B001AITGWE|3.0|The plot is somewhat predictable -- and slow moving. If you relate to this movie showing an aerospace engineer descend into vilolence, recommed seeking immediate medical attention.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have bought several songs and received an album using this feature. I am pleased with the quality and variety available.
1451695195|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite books this year!  I was able to finish it in just a couple of days. The science, the love, and the miracle of it all.  I couldn't catch my breath at the end regarding Eben's sister.  Tears of joy - made me so happy!  Oh, wait.  I better not say more...except Get this Book!
B0076DELIG|4.0|The unsolved murder of a young woman discovered in a riot torn alley haunts Bosh. Twenty years later he reopens his investigation which leads to a first Gulf War R&R that gets out of hand and leads him to unravel a decades old conspiracy that will threaten to take his own life. If you love a good, action packed mystery, you will enjoy this read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When you read this book it changes you and the way you think and what you thought you knew. It makes you open your eyes and think more about how important life already is and has been, it is simply amazing. There is a warning I will give about being a certain age when you read this you will probably want to be in high school or older for reasons of drugs and alcohol ect, but otherwise it is amazing. Love always, Audry
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love, Love, Love Downton!! Season 2 is just as great as season 1! Definatelly a recommended show to watch, you won't be dissapointed!!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Easy to use. Easy to read.  Great graphics. Mutiple settings in multiple functions and a  trigger yet.  An incredible value.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game because I just love watching horses run and<br /> Move... It helps now that I don't have any horses right now.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I am not a fantasy book reader but loved this trilogy! The first and third were my personal favorite.<br />There is some violence and and I'm not super into that but I was able to put it past me.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I just got this headset as an upgrade from the X11, that was decent but lacked the fidelity, power and gizmos of the newer headsets.<br /><br />What I was looking from the new headset was:<br />* Wireless Headset<br />* Wireless chat<br />* 7.1 or 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound<br />* Programmable presets<br />* Price<br /><br />So several options came up.<br /><br />- Ear Force Tango<br />- PX 5<br />- XP400  (NOT completely wireless )<br />- XP500<br />- Astro A50 ( NOT completely wireless )<br /><br />Because of the wireless chat option on the Tango and others, I went for the Tangos because Amazon dropped the price to $199, and because I mainly play BO2 I wanted to test the footstep preset for this game.<br /><br />So far the headset is solid! no interference at all, even with the wireless router at a side, the sound is very, very good. You can hear the difference right when you turn on the XBOX with the start up sound.<br /><br />The Bass is incredible and the footstep preset in BO2 works! I boosted my kills in S&D because of these babies!<br /><br />The quality is perfect, very well assembled and the materials used are top of the line.<br /><br />The bluetooth feature is excellent, I can pair them with my nexus 7 to listen to my favorite music while gamming.<br /><br />The only downside I can find is the XBA adapter, I tried every single preset for chat, and I the mic volume is very low, I need to talk very loud in order to the XBA to catch the sound and transmit it to the XBOX controller. I say this is an issue with the XBA because I can hear myself perfectly in the headset. It seems there is a way to customize the mic response with the sound editor, but I haven't been able to play with that.<br /><br />If you have the cash, I would suggest to go for the Tangos instead of the newest models as this one has better materials and is very comfortable overall
B00A2YKD4M|5.0|I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loved it! Was in pretty good shape and a good deal.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I wouldn't have guessed that a show about some Brits set in the early 1900s would be a &#34;hit&#34; but boy was I wrong. I decided to check out this series after hearing so much about from friends and family, and I'm glad I did. The cast all wonderfully embrace their roles, you genuinely start rooting for the &#34;good&#34; characters and despising the manipulators. In my opinion this season is rather depressing, with the focus being on the Great War and its affect on both the men who fought it and the civilians back home coping with the losses. As expected Downton rises to the occasion to provide support for the wounded troops, but it is tough on everyone involved. I was fascinated by the look into the First World War, which gets very little attention compared to WWII, but it left me feeling very sorry for anyone who had to live through that time. Despite the tragedy, the show is superbly written and worth your time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 certainly  had some surprises.  Julian Fellowes has done a great job interweaving history and issues of the day.  I love watching how the fashions change, too.
B004SDEP38|2.0|this a viewer only. you need to buy  full version for word processing. Don't expect to edit with this program.
B0020TS5JC|4.0|I like this show.There is a lot of action . The story is pretty good and the acting is good.It is sci-fi and I do not usually like that but the movie made me reconsider viewing other sci-fi shows.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|This is all I need for editing, creating, and saving docs.  Has a good spreed sheet editor also. Works well with Verizon pantech.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Clever and entertaining. Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Lui have great on-screen chemistry. I can't wait each week for the next episode.
0060873027|4.0|I'm not sure why people have been giving this book such a low rating.  Yes, the scientific basis on which the whole \\"shrinking\\" thing is based, is very flimsy, but that's because not much as been researched or investigated on the topic.  Not many scientists spend their time and doctorates on researching the possibility of shrinking down to the micro level.  Why should they?  There's no reason to believe it's possible.  Therefore, there's no real scientific backing to base the ability to shrink things.  However, if you can overlook this, the story itself is very good.  You get a very vivid, up-close look at some of the creatures we know the least about.  I love insects and arachnids and feel I know quite a bit about them because I've done a lot of research on them, but I was thrilled to be learning new things with seemingly every chapter I read.  The bibliography on the creatures encountered in this book is very extensive, and it could be argued that in this area, it is VERY scientifically accurate.  So ignore the hype and give this book a try.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|not too much dialogue but some of the games are too easy! keep the games coming but some of them are confusing - specify please
B008NMT684|5.0|I have used this app to keep my 2-year old quiet in restaurants and even in church.  He LOVES it.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|First 4/5 of the book was outstanding. The last few chapters got very weird and I had to skim through it because it was so...weird. I really like the author's writing style and will keep reading his stories. :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great way to pass the time. The game is good for people of all ages. It also doesn't take ages for things to happen. For daily gifts, please add Evriel.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've never read the graphic novel, so every episode is a treat. No spoilers for me and I'm loving every minute of it. So well done. Great performances. Smitten with all the characters and the way they're developing. The demands of my imagination are met with the concept of a world dominated by, \\"The Walking Dead\\".
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting, drama, intrigue, characters you love to love and love to hate, visually pleasing, what more could you ask for!!!
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I Installed this in the white unibody macbook (2008 version). The product works just fine.  No complaints. . . .

B001ANSSDC|3.0|There was so much about football that it tended to bore me at times. I loved how the story ended, definitely his silver lining
B00846TRHY|5.0|If you can handle the details of the reality of Uganda, this is an excellent movie. I was aware of the horrors of Uganda, but to see someone go to lengths that Sam Childers did to help those children is amazing and touching. I cried alot through out this movie, but I also highly recommend it. Remember this is a true story and the details of it are not for the weak of heart.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|This Is A Very Fun Movie If You Have Enjoyed The Men In Black Series.Fun For All.I Enjoyed Watching This Movie.
B00338QENI|5.0|Rebecca Skloot did an amazing job interviewing and becoming part of the Lacks family in order to tell the story of their mother, Henrietta Lacks.  It's a story of highs and lows.  The highs are amazing contributions to science that Henrietta's &#34;HeLa&#34;  cells have allowed in the past 60 years - from vaccines to mapping the human genome.  The lows are the sadness of Henrietta's illness and death as well as the sociocultural impact on her children. A reader will be thankful to Henrietta for her cells and to Rebecca for her story.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|I think I misunderstood or the product was misrepresented. The sounds are just a very short repetition over and over again. More annoying rather than soothing.<br /><br />I think I wasted some good money.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I haven't seen the movie but have heard many different stories about it. I had heard that the storyline wasn't very good, but the dancing was incredible. I'm not a Channing Tatum fan, but when I saw the picture of Matthew Bomer, I was hooked. Then I heard that he did not have much screen time, so I decided not to see the movie. But I've still heard nothing bad about the dancing, so if that is what floats your boat, go for it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
080701429X|3.0|More of a personal account of the author's terrible experience as a victim of the Holocaust than a blueprint for living, this popular book is still worth reading.<br /><br />But if you are in a &#34;search for meaning&#34;, you won't find it here. To be fair, Frankl never sets out to answer the question, and in fact proposes that each individual must answer it on their own, for themselves.<br /><br />Frankl's position seems to be very similar to those of people like Albert Camus: that despite man's incessant search, there is no inherent meaning in life. Frankl differs in his response to this reality from people like Camus in that his solution to the meaninglessness of life is to create meaning on our own, based on our own interests and experiences. For Frankl this meant identifying with human suffering and helping others to find individual meaning. For me at least, it's hardly enough.<br /><br />Of course there are no easy answers, and that is precisely the point.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Could not put down.  My favorite Tom Clancy of all time......actually my favorite thriller of all time. Looks like I need to pay attention to Mark Greaney....and NO I do not know the authors.
B004VRL4BM|1.0|Disappointed.  Was not informed it was not for my region 1. It needs to be more clearly stated what regions these movies were for.  I will have to return it
B00622B3MY|5.0|The movie is very cute my kids love it. It worth the money. Download it. Great movie. I even love it.
B009YQJ322|4.0|I actually rented this film after a conflict of thoughts where I was unsure of the differences between this film and the 1995's film, [[ASIN:B004IDG97S Judge Dredd]] - plus, I am not all that crazy about the action/death scenes. After watching it, I found it to be quite real and okay but both films were reasonably good in their respects and totally unrelated. The major difference was that Urban never once removed his helmet and Stallone regrettably did. While Stallone did well in his portrayal of Dredd \\"back in the day,\\" Urban did a terrific job in that portrayal.<br /><br />What really gets on my nerve is the character Ma-Ma, as played by Lena Headey. She managed to take up a residence in my horrendous nightmares with her Slo-Mo drugs and ruthless, conscienceless acts. Such a scary woman, no doubt. However, to counteract that aspect, a cute Judge Anderson (embodied by Olivia Thirlby) - a psychic who feels the thoughts and emotions of others and using those abilities to save her and Dredd from any immediate danger. She began with such doubts and fears and ended up with gained strengths, clear focus, and willpower.<br /><br />Personally, it was a good \\"action\\" film with interesting characters.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|U just collect 8 pages while u hope u don't somehow bump into a non scary man with no face...oh an once you have successfully collected the pages..guess what u start all over from the beginning an do if all over again...from the VERY beginning...no stage two or different sceneries jus do it all over again...rip off I'm loaded for the price

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm an avid reader so I read many books. I think this book was by far one of the best I've read yet. It was hard to put it down.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent read!  The movie will not be able to compare too much to the book. I finished this book in two days! I can't wait to read other books by Suzanne Collins.
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|Great to hear new stuff from Ben Harper, and the deep south blues that Musselwhite brings to the table blends perfect with Ben's voice.  Great album!
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I liked this movie.  Good special effects.  I like to watch movies that show the original fairy tales as they were originally written, not the Disney version.  This movie is about the &#34;real&#34; Snow White story, not the Disney version.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am impatiently waiting for season 4. I do not have cable capabilities in my apt complex so loved that I was able to get this series on Amazon!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Although we just saw a movie with a very similar story, this was a page turner with characters who were well developed. I will look for more books by JoJo
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I have read Watership Down twice and so enjoy this wonderful adventure of a group of rabbits leaving the only place they have known because one of the rabbits has a premonition of a horrible event about to overtake their safe and comfortable warren.  Although an attempt is made to warn all of their fellow rabbits of the impending doom, very few join the group, which the story centers around, to embark on grand adventures and establish a new warren in a safer place.  This is a book for all ages and all time!
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|a bit excruciating to watch and listen to at times.  It feel to much like a peep show to be totally comfortable
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is definitely my favorite of the Kate Morton books - and that's saying a lot. It blends the past and present in an interesting and spellbinding way, and the twists and turns at the end were ones I could not have seen coming. It is a book that I am sure that I will revisit again, even now knowing the ending. Simply a great read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook is compelling and intensely real while still very informative· It is time to stop pretending like families are normal and that nothing is wrong with anyone· Quick's novel gives people an outlet to finally get real about mental illnesses·

B004LSO7IS|5.0|It was a beautiful film. The characters were well developed and the outdoor scenes were lovely.  Would appreciate more films like this one.
B0026KZ3T0|4.0|I enjoyed this film tremendously. A light hearted love story with just the right amount of humor added.<br />I recommend this film.

B006Z21ZGK|5.0|A great blu-ray, with stellar audio and video. Quick cuts are kept in check, making it very enjoyable. For hardcore fans, setlist is good for the first half as we get new songs.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Very enjoyable game. Very relaxing. I would highly recommend this game to everyone.Music good. Pictures great.. Easy and fun to work.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Love this movie.  Even though it's a Disney movie it's still a good adult or kid movie.  Great Story great acting.
1603425381|5.0|Love to crochet in the winter months and all the books were a welcome to my fireside projects<br />These borders are a great help in many of my projects
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is exceptional.  I am almost always pleased when I read something that validates how I feel but this surpassed my expectations.  It is very well researched and she is wonderfully articulate.  As I was reading, virtually everything I wondered about was addressed a little further on as though she knew my thoughts, which clearly echoed her own experiences.  More superlatives fail me.  I have recommended it everyone I know who reads.  Unfortunately, not many of my extrovert  friends do.
B00992CF6W|5.0|mine craft is AWSOME it is kind of educational game because you build things and you can fight monsters I don't care that it is seven $ I would buy it even it was 20$
B000V8A95C|5.0|This edition of the Wicked soundtrack is wonderful - i bought it about a week before seeing Wicked on Broadway for my first time (and it absolutely blew me away), and it was nice to hear the songs and get a feel for the musical numbers in the production. I recommend it to everybody who enjoys musical theatre, be it you've seen Wicked yet or not! You will find yourself strangely addicted to the songs and listening to the soundtrack repeatedly! :)
B001CDLATE|4.0|Maybe we need to see the negative sides of life because they are there and exist right? Perhaps people are a little blind and unaware of the reality of the world, but I would recommend the next film SAMSARA hands down. That one at least give hope in the end in humanity by ending on not such a dire and negatively depressing note. However, this film is beautiful and a feat in visual documentary and cinematography and should not be taken lightly. It is a film that is felt. A visual meditation of the utmost proportions.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Well I loved this app for yrs via I phone love it now on my s3 .... but on my kindle fire hd it would just give me false readings :) like when its really 25 here it said it was -3 all my saved cities were wrong I forced quit thinking that would help but nope uninstalled and now it tells me every time weather channel has stop won't even stay open so sad suck that's why I'm giving a 2 star rating for now till fixed
B00AFEY354|5.0|I love this movie. It is well directed, well put together... There are funny parts and sad parts, I cried and so did the people I have watched it with. I love this movie so much that I had to buy it for my play station so I could watch it right away because I didn't realize it wasn't out on DVD yet. I hope you all enjoy!
B00846F1YW|4.0|Mysteryville 2 is entertaining. Enjoyable for most. objects are not overly difficult to find and the occasional puzzles are simple enough. A good game for those who prefer mostly finding hidden objects. Not overly challenging but a good game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app. easy and fun and the graphics are awesome! for all ages of horse and animal lovers.
B00AJLHUAS|1.0|Odd. Odd that Mr. Ferry would make a lame sounding recording of such great music. Sure, I get it, he wanted it to sound like it was recorded in the Jazz Age in the 1920s. But people listened to music in the 1920s on Victrolas, we don't. It sounds awful on any sort of modern hi-fi.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i love it but i need more gems like 1000000000 so that i can buy the rest of it to buy all dragons and islands
1400064287|5.0|Very good book. Interesting in its genre. I do recommend especially for people who just like to enjoy reading random things
0765325950|5.0|A Memory of Light, the 14th volume of The Wheel of Time saga, is also the final tome of a capstone trilogy penned by Brandon Sanderson, who picked up the reins when Robert Jordan died in 2007. Sanderson picked up where Jordan left off, using notes and scenes that Jordan had described to his wife prior to his untimely demise. What Mr. Sanderson has managed to accomplish is nothing short of incredible.<br /><br />Jordan, a master at creating a layered world filled with real characters, had- to put it gently- a very long-winded way of telling this story. The main plot lines often got lost in secondary and tertiary stories and characters that garnered little regard or care from this reviewer. Story advancement became very fitful and slow after say the fifth book in the series, and it was bogged down by the sheer number of players and plot lines.<br /><br />Sanderson picked up the pieces in The Gathering Storm, and while one can tell that there is a different voice now, the story and characters remained very much true to Jordan's vision. Continued on through The Towers of Midnight and into this final, exquisite entry, Sanderson brings a wondrous, fulfilling and long-awaited conclusion to the saga, one 23 years in the making.<br /><br />Sanderson and Jordan have built a crescendo that matches anything I've read in this genre, including the Lord of the Rings. This volume likely contains as much action as the whole series prior; there seems to literally be action on every page. The pages are filled with both bitter-sweet and desperate moments, You ache for the characters, you cheer the demise of antagonists, you grieve for the fate of heroes. Your pulse quickens as the story reaches its climax, and when you flip the last page and read those final words, you can't help but sigh and reflect on the 23 year journey you took with these characters.<br /><br />I commend Mr. Sanderson and the late Mr. Jordan on their work and brilliant imaginations. This truly is the seminal high-fantasy master-work of our time, and it garners my highest recommendation.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Very good product at an excellent price. The Cd's are just great and the whole package is quite thin. I do recommend.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Well priced and well delivered.  Thank you very much.  Adding it to my classics video collection.  Bought the record too.
B00006JDU9|5.0|Oh well, Star Wars again. You have to have it if you're a Star Wars fan. It's fundamental to have the complete saga
B007THA4FI|3.0|Not a bad story but it doesn't keep my attention. Seems like it's rambling on about not a whole lot most of the time. I guess I had higher expectations.

B001EIOOV8|5.0|Casino tells the story of the mob's involvement in Vegas, the rise and fall and everything in between, through Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Casino is a magnificent gangster/crime film.<br /><br />The story in Casino is immersive and interesting; despite being 3 hours long, the film never feels like it drags on as it goes over many different events, from catching cheating gamblers to catching cheating wives. Although it does have some ultra-violent scenes (the clamps!), it generally relies on its authentic dialogue. The ending of the film is also great. The acting in this film is superb; Robert De Niro is amazing, Joe Pesci is brilliant, and Sharon Stone is magnificent; add on the rest of the supporting/minor roles that were also grade A, and you have an all-around excellent cast. The music in this film is also fitted perfectly, as with most of Scorsese films.<br /><br />I own the original Blu-ray of this film (not the 100th Universal Anniversary edition). It comes with one Blu-Ray disc, with the full length film and special features (including deleted scenes and special reports) packed in. The picture quality is definitely an upgrade from previous versions, although it's one par with other upgrades like \\"Taxi Driver\\" or \\"Blade Runner\\". Regardless, fans of the film should own the Blu-ray version of this classic.<br /><br />Overall, Casino is a brilliant crime drama with excellent performances. I highly recommend a purchase for everyone- fan of the genre or not.<br /><br />Casino has very strong violence and blood, some nudity and sex.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great game for people who love the first Temple Run and try to see when you trip over something and try to see if you can escape the monkey(or gorilla) :p

B005VPRF0M|3.0|Age states for a 7 year old, but the pieces are way to small. Very difficult for my 7 year old to manage.
B0090X4HES|5.0|This CD rocks. Kendrick Lamar is definitely the next big thing and I urge you to order it. I'm glad I did.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love his books.  Mitch Rapp is my kind of action hero.  OO7 has nothing on this guy.  If you like action and smart thinking then this is the book for you.  If you like Jack Reacher you will also like Mitch Rapp.  I can't get enough of these guys.  I read these books over and over they are so good and my memory is so short it's the best combination for total enjoyment.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|All I need is my faithful Kindle! Who needs a regular alarm clock! This app does it all! I can listen to my favorite music to wake up in the morning plus, I can adjust the snooze time. No alarm clock can do that! I highly recommend it! I even have my daughter hooked on this app.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I love this album.  The vocals are well driven and the instruments the perfect support for them.<br /><br />I tend to be more into the hard rock, but sometimes you need a little softer more relaxing music at times.  Florence + The Machine is one of those bands that smooth things over without making me bored.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I re-read this book after what must have been 15 years.  Parts of the book were still very vivid in my mind after all this time, but it was fantastic reading it again.  The characters are great, and the story flows well.<br /><br />Parts of the story are applicable to how certain groups think, act and work today.  More (and fair) communication is needed between the different groups.
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of The Dog In The  Night-Time by Mark Haddon is a coming of age tale written from the view point of a fifteen year old boy. What makes this novel especially interesting is that the main character, Christopher, is a high functioning autistic teen dealing with a scope of family and educational issues. This novel is a great addition to a secondary education curriculum because it reflects the specific issues that autistic children deal with. For example, the chapters are numbered according to the prime number series rather than the Aramaic (1,2,3,4...) number series. In the novel, Christopher receives special instruction and counseling from a team of specialists at his school. For Chris, who has several violent outbursts through out the novel, the inclusion into the general classroom is unacceptable. He feels much safer with people he already knows and any deviation from the norm, results in the complete loss of control. Chris is incredibly intelligent when dealing with spatial memory, mathematics and numbers. However, he has extreme difficulty identifying and understanding how others feel. The novel elaborates on this difficulty and explains the instruction that Christopher receives from his closest \\"friend\\", his counselor. Christopher's counselor uses flash cards with a range of \\"smiley faces\\" (smiles, frowns, crying. etc.), which Chris must interpret. This is a fairly accurate novel, when concerning inclusion and instruction, after all, a special education teacher who specializes in autism wrote it. Furthermore, this novel allows students to investigate the feelings and unique difficulties that are inherent in an autistic students everyday life. It allows them to reflect on the differences therein, but moreover, it allows students to see that individuals with autism are more alike than different. I plan to have my students create a visual diagram comparing/contrasting the educational and social difficulties and achievements of the main character.I also plan to have them write a letter to Chris's mother explaining how Chris feels. The essay will certainly be the most difficult; Christopher throughout the novel doesn't explain how he feels because he can't. However, there is ample evidence that he does have a depth of emotion and specific details that led the reader to an understanding of Christopher that is unthinkable at the start of the novel. In short, find it, buy it, read it, I guarantee that you'll love it.
B0090SI3ZW|4.0|There's a lot of Kung Fu movies out there from other countries of the world that<br />was never available to the Americas, but with the internet and technology they<br />are finding their way here.  Lots of fighting, lots of us again them scenarios<br />and lots of bad dubbing when available.  So when i saw this movie, i understood<br />its parody and its really pretty good with a good budget and nice costumes.<br />My oh My ...love Russell Crowe....the man has gain lots of weight but still<br />delivers on his acting..<br />Yes i like this movie, and is a keeper
B005P9SLES|5.0|Grew up in Hawai'i and remember the original Hawaii 5-0. This is an excellent reboot for the modern era. And Grace Park is hot too.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Toooo much sex.  It's like too much profanity in a movie after a while it just gets blah blah blah, I could barely get through it.  I know I'm in the minority, but come-on where is the power of using your imagination just a little in novels and I don't get how any strong, independent woman would go for any of this riduculous bondage bologna.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Didn't think I would enjoy this series, but was so wrøng.  Such a vivid depiction of life in that era.
B00000JGOJ|5.0|LOVE this film & it was a bargain deal, especially for a film out of production for years! Exactly as described, fast shipping.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I find myself constantly playing this game. It's very challenging and fun,plus its free. Definitely worth a try!!! You may want to buy a few gems though.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|The i5-3470 is a great CPU processor, is just 5% less powerful than the i5-3570k and for 40$ of price difference i don't have a doubt. Excellent purchase.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|This is absolutely the brightest flashlight I have ever owned.  It uses regular AA batteries which can be recharged.  I just wish it included a second battery pack so one set of batteries could be charging while the other is being used.  Very durable.  I have already dropped it one time and picked up back up and it still worked.
0307593525|5.0|This book is a tour-de-force of French cooking. I use it all the time and especially for recipes on special days - birthdays and anniversaries. French cooking involves rigorous techniques and this book has beautifully assembled them. If you follow the book faithfully, every dish comes out exquisitely and you feel proud presenting them. It is a fun, leisure read as well. Just watch out for the calories :)
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|We have thoroughly enjoyed every LEGO movie we've purchased just as much as we have the LEGO games.  While this one isn't out yet, the previews of it make it look OUTSTANDING.  If it's anything like the others, the kids will flip.<br /><br />I would have given this 5-out-of-5 stars, except that it's a BATMAN movie and comes with a CLARK KENT minifig.  Bruce Wayne is Batman...
B000P0J09M|5.0|definitely one of my favorite mob movies- robert de niro is amazingly good in this film, as is the rest of the stellar cast!

B004CS7R70|5.0|Got these for my Dad who suffers from Macular Degeneration. I didn't have sufficient reviews or info to be sure that these would work. However I had to try. He received them a few days ago and called me immediately very pleased.<br /><br />He said the adjusters were a little difficult for tender hands but that with a little patience he got them adjusted to suit him. We concluded that some difficult adjusting for him was well worth the fact that once adjusted these stayed adjusted.<br /><br />It is hard to relate just what an improvement in life these &#34;Eschenbach MaxTV Glasses&#34; have made in this mans life. He is elated as to how he can now enjoy TV so much more now. He can also see the TV in his bedroom and see things around the house much better if he wishes.<br /><br />NOTE: These have a limited field of view, that is side to side and up and down. Dad wanted me to make sure and advise against trying to stand or walk around with binocular glasses on. Although, knowing him, he may have tested that to some extent.<br /><br />Thank You Eschenbach for such a wonderful thing.

0838577016|5.0|The book was in mint condition, no issues whatsoever in that realm. I just didn't realize that I ordered the Fourth Ed instead of the Fifth Ed, which was my fault.
B005IFWXWU|4.0|I loved this man's acting, and now I love his music. Amazon has it for a great price, but if you look at a certain other famous electronic music vendor, you'll find that, for a slightly higher price, you can get a bonus track that isn't available here. Just sayin.'
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|A fabulous re-read. Good writing doesn't date and Daphne de Maurier is a master at the art of gripping the reader in a finely-worded tale.
B008Y5F7YW|5.0|The original Apocalypse Now was a phenomenal movie - this one took it even farther!  The French colonialists add another dimension to the background detail.  Also, Brando's role was more expansive in Redux!
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Loving this album the more I listen to it!  They are kind of like a chiller version of Animal Collective.  Check it out!
B002APU580|4.0|While I found it rather lengthy, I enjoyed every minute and felt the threads of romance being woven into the story. A classic for sure!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|There's a lot of different apps out there that do the same thing as this one, but this one does it well and reliably. A matter of personal preference, really.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i think that this game is awesome also it gives u second chance that is if you get like jewels or somethin but you should get it its free and it is sooooooooo FUN!!!!!!!!!
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie never lets you down with her music and she hasn't with this cd either!!  Wonderful music and new songs!!!  A variety to listen to!!
B008J344BQ|2.0|It just blanks out the dirty wordsand just sounds awful. They used to have cleaner songs to replace the ones with dirty words.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's perfect with reading plans for anyone. The app works good and the catch up feature is really nice if you get behind. I love this app.
B0000076MI|5.0|Ten Years After is best known for &#34;I'd Love to Change the World,&#34; a staple of FM Classic Rock. But at their core, they were a terrific blues rock quartet, ably led by guitarist and vocalist Alvin Lee. This is a sound that was big in both Europe and the US at the time, when a new appreciation for the cannon of electric blues and boogie was finding fresh expression from a variety of talented and dedicated artists. Recorded in Europe, this record has some great slow blues, such as &#34;Help Me,&#34; and rave-ups such as &#34;I'm Goin' Home&#34; (better than the version from Woodstock), and &#34;Choo-choo Mama.&#34; The quartet stretches out here, jamming ably with their straightforward and driving style, with a tight-but-loose rhythm section and tasty organ as well. A favorite record.
B00AATV046|5.0|This is a great timeless movie.  Cary Grant plays an angel who comes to answer a prayer by the Bishop, David Niven. The angel helps bring fun and joy to the Bishop's wife and the whole household.  It has a great deal of Christmas spirit without being heavy or preachy.  It is so much fun to watch all the people around Cary Grant come to life and be more alive and happier. Niven's prayer is finally answered, but not the way he expected. It is truly an enjoyeable and delightful picture.
B000002GHH|5.0|Rehearsed, recorded and mixed in just a few days, this stellar record represents a high point in John Hiatt's compelling songwriting, performed by his best ever backing band (and he's had some good ones), including Ry Cooder on guitar, Nick Lowe on bass, and Jim Keltner on drums. The material John is dealing with here is by turns humorous, sorrowful, and humble, as he documents struggles with sobriety, marital and financial difficulties, and the ups and downs of family life generally. The desolate and heartbreaking honesty of songs like &#34;Have a Little Faith in Me&#34; are tempered by more upbeat material such as &#34;Memphis in the Meantime,&#34; a commentary on life in Nashville, and &#34;Thing Called Love,&#34; (also a big hit for Bonnie Raitt). The fact that the record was put together so quickly (due to scheduling issues) means that it is not over-produced or over-thought, and this lets the strong material shine with minimal but very creative accompaniment, so ably rendered by the stellar players here, sounding every bit as good as the best work of The Rolling Stones, or early Faces. Jim Keltner lays down great grooves with the soulful Mr. Lowe on bass, and Ry Cooder gives the guitar both lean muscle and soaring slide. One of my favorite all-time records, great for a road trip. Highest recommendation.
0679722610|5.0|When I first started reading this, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. However, with the writing style, intrigue, action, and jaw dropping moments, Red Harvest kept me on my toes. Personville (a fictionalized Butte, Montana) is corrupt to its eyeballs, making this little mountain town less than ideal. I am going to enjoy the rest of Mr. Hammet's novels, I'm sure.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Amazingly interesting story just too odd to be made up.  Great pace and suprising turns along the way.  Highly recommended!
B001LRJH0K|4.0|All of you people whinning that this movie is to slow, not enough action, dull. Get a clue! In the real old west it was very rare that people went riding around shooting at each other. Everybody wants violence today. There is violence in this movie, but just enough, and not over done. Everything is period perfect, clothing, weapons and such. Even the glass in the windows isn't to todays standards. Historically correct. And Rene Zellweger is just fine here. And Viggo and Ed, true to form as tough, no nonsense lawmen. Historically correct. And Viggo's character is educated. He came from the eastern USA,  not that unusual. Even the dialogue was historically accurate. Excellent photography and beautiful scenery helps aswell. This is a pretty realistic western, ie Open Range, it's definitely NOT your standard John Wayne shoot em' up. Although there certainly is nothing wrong with them, pilgrim!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It is slow going because of the language. Difficult to read because it's language like 100 yrs ago. Weird. Haven't gotten very far and doubt I will finish.
B0008237BO|4.0|Any real fan of music must have a copy in their library, I wonder if Dick Clark had an original in his.  It is just to bad that we have to keep buying the same things over and over through time.  They just keep changing the format to how we listen.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the book but it was a little bit too technical for me which made it hard to continue reading. However, for those that like that type of thing I recommend it. Makes you want to go to Heaven.
B00846F1YW|5.0|HAVE to say first off that I  have played a few of these types of games..  and this is definitely the best so far... I am on level 16... have had NO problems with freezing up... (read the other reviews so I wanted to make sure I got past that &quot;level 13 problem&quot; before I wrote my review)....  it is a good way to fill free time..  plenty of variety..  and at times quite the challenge! Love the pinch and zoom function.. and the humor in the story is shall we say......&quot;special&quot; LOL.  Keep up the good work!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun, energetic, amazing, and totally awesome. This game is my favorit out of all of my games on my device this game is fun for kids and adults.
B0086700CM|1.0|Temple run is a classic and highly addicting and so is temple run 2 BUT the tilt does NOT work on either app so until this &quot;bug,&quot; is fixed kindle fire users I ask that you not use it. This may seem like a small problem but since in temple run 1 I can't tilt means I can't get pass the tutorial which cannot be shut off in settings . FIX THE PROBLEMS !
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The plot took too much time to develop.  Too much useless political posturing.  Action is good at the end of the movie.  I feel as if there is a lot left out and the book is better.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|This book not only answers the question posed by its title, it provides context for the development of the differences that exist.  I find that extra information to be very valuable.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Enjoyed. Quick read. Good for teens and adults. Looking forward to the other movies when they come out. Recommend reading. Kimmichelen
B00499LTLM|4.0|All BBC series' tend to be short, but Sherlock follows the three, one and a half hour episode formula, which is disappointing considering that it is such a great show. You feel like you're just starting to get acquainted with the characters, and then the series is over.<br /><br />Outside of that one complaint, there is really nothing else bad you can say about this series. It's easy to fall in love with London as the setting, while Sherlock is fantastically played by Cumberbatch. The character of Watson, meanwhile, gives us that window into Sherlock's world in a similar manner as the books. The storylines themselves are not just based on the stories of old, but contain several nearly identical moments, masterfully updated for the modern world.<br /><br />The production quality is very good, and the usage of on-screen writing to clue us into Sherlock's thought process is a very innovative and welcomed technique. The rapport between Sherlock and Watson isn't that good at the beginning, but it slowly begins to develop by the final episode, which is actually how things would be if these two just met like the way they did. The subtly mixed in comedy is also a great addition.<br /><br />This series will undoubtedly be compared to CBS' Elementary, but truthfully, this is the better of the two. That isn't a knock against the excellent Elementary, but a compliment to Sherlock.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I love the game and I would give it 5 stars otherwise but the only problem Solis about spending your money. 1. they add these illustrious names for the expencive ones and horrible names for the cheap ones. 2. the 40% more is 40% more than the first one being bought again and again until that price
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I am a sucker for a happy ending. Goodness should<br />always  overcome as it did in this story. Jamie stole my heart!
B009AMALGM|2.0|I have seen all the Paranormal Activity movies, and this movie isn't as good as the previous movies at all. The movie never scared me a tiny bit. I had a crush on the teen girl the entire time, and sadly that's as far as I would come to liking this movie. She so cute!<br /><br />What made the PA series was all the suspense and mystery. There not much of it in this one. Also, the demon, Toby, isn't as major part of the movie anymore. It seemed like he took a back seat, and letted others around him do more killings and it's pretty obvious.<br /><br />I really shouldn't had watched this movie. It's funny too, how I didn't even know it was coming out in the theaters, until one day, I saw a poster for it, while I was there for a different movie. There wasn't any marketing done for this movie. It could be because it wasn't that good. I remember seeing Paranormal Activity 3 commercials everyday until it finally showed in the theaters. They kept on showing the commercials afterwards too. But, this? This one didn't have anything, but a poster in theaters. Not a single commercial for it! Wow.<br /><br />Everyone that actually likes the PA series, should not see this one. They need to stay faraway from it because you will end up not liking the series anymore. Unless, you are just like me, and find the girl in the movie cute and just watch it for her alone. lol<br /><br />Okay, I warned you. Now make your choice.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|With so many terrible Sci-Fi movies and shows that get turned into big budget productions, it's a welcome surprise to have a really good movie made from a visionary and incredible story that was written one hundred years ago. Is John Carter the master piece of \\"film\\" or character development? No. It's a Sci-Fi Adventure! Lighten up! But it is an epic adventure and a heck of a lot of fun! It's what Sci-Fi should be, fantastic, almost believable (I'm willing to over look a few things now and then ;-) and it should make you think of things you've never thought of, take you places you'd would like to go again and introduce you to people you want to see more of. John Carter succeeds in all these things and more. If you don't have this movie yet, do yourself and sci-fi in general a favor and buy it right now. If you listen really carefully to the rustling wind in the cool Martian evening you just might hear it whispering \\"Barsoom, Barsoom - Take me back to Barsoom!\\"
B002ZG976U|5.0|I gave it a 5 star because I will watch it over and over.  I have watched good movies but most of them I will watch  only once.  I will watch anything with Cher in it, I've always liked her.  I didn't find it offensive in any way, just some good entertainment.
0385342063|4.0|I have enjoyed some of the author's other books but they were at times pretty ridiculous. \\"I've Got Your Number\\" tells of Poppy who picks up a phone out of a trash can. Instead of meeting someone on Face Book, she comes to know and in a way, works for Sam who lost his private assistant.<br />The story takes a few turns and keeps moving forward. When writing a story, one might ask what makes this story unique? The footnotes are a different take than any other story I have read or listend to. On the CD the footnotes are included in the conversation so they do not get lost as I have read in the other reviews. Also we learn so much about the story from the texts on the phone. Someday this will date the book, but right now it makes it current and intersting.<br /><br />Jean Ferratier<br />Author, Reading Symbolic Signs:<br />How To Connect the Dots of Your Spiritual Life
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the writing but the ending didn't stand up to to the story.....<br />It was unbelievable to me.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I am not a big fan of Hip Hop, especially the 'gangsta' style.  This album is funny, philosophical, and poetic.  The lyrics are wonderful and the sound is fulfilling.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This was an OK ending to the latest Batman trilogy, but it was a little long.  My wife was having trouble keeping engaged, and there were several places where the story was fairly obvious, with nothing that surprising.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is tremendous fun.  It takes some patience to follow the directions and get the ponies in order, but that's a great lesson for my little one.  Frustrating that there aren't more ways to get gems and hearts.  Overall great game for kids who enjoy My Little Pony.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|this is by far one of our fav track, all the songs are great, he's such a good singer, recommend, you'll not be dissapointed!
0439023521|3.0|At first I thought this book was so amazing and everyone who didnt like it was a loser, but as I thought more about this book i found more and more flaws that make this book confusing and unrealistic in so many ways. Dont get me wrong though the writing style is fantastic and to see this dystopian world was very interesting.<br /><br />Here are the flaws. First off there is no way that the whole continent thought it was sick but did nothing about it.Slavery went on for decades in the U.S but people tried to stop it from happening atleast because some people dont have to be taught that owning someone is wrong. Some how cinna is the only one in the whole entire population of the capitol who knows this is sick but he is a stylist for the the very thing he thinks is horrible? It gets better to he even said he would bet on katniss to win any way so i guess he condradicts himself making this character confusing and i really have no idea how to connect to this character like your supposed in good books because his actions and words do not speak the same thing. i dont know what his motives are or his personality.<br /><br />Second is that the author wrote a very mature premise for teenagers? There was a lot of potential in this book. I think Battle Royale and Divergent really captured that. So once again she basically tried to make healthy icecream and everyone loved it.....wtf.<br /><br />Third katniss is very selfish and mean. She could not have won unless other people helped her in every single scnario in the games.she wouldnt have gotten away from clove if it werent for th boy from district9. She wouldnt have killed glimmer if it werent for rue. she wouldve been dead if it werent for thresh. etc etc. Apparently she is a strong female role. Bitch do something yourself then you can be a strong female role.<br /><br />Fourth I really wanted to know more but i couldnt because she was so vague on her dystopian world i was confused when i kept reading the series. Koushan Takami (author of &#34;battle royale&#34;) and Veronica Roth (author of &#34;divergent&#34;) created their dystopian worlds in clear way so i didnt have to make up parts of the novel so it would make sense like the hunger games. For instance you only saw maybe half the people die in the book and i wanted to know what happened to half the other tributes.Or maybe the setting i wanted to know because North america doesnt really cut it. a map of panem would have been really helpful so i could know how big each district is or if the capitol is half the population or not because that would explain why nobody revolted earlier but that does bring up how in the world did they beat the capitol? there are so many question about this world but the book doesnt bring answers.<br /><br />So i conclude with this i thought it was okay not even good and i have so many questoins about this book i really want some answers or opinions about this.
B005GG0MIS|3.0|This book was interesting, and I learned some things I did not know.  But it seemed to repeat things more than once, and could have been edited to make it more readable.
0345803485|1.0|I remember reading this smut in Harlequin Romances back in the 80s. Just as stupid and pointless as &#34;they&#34; were back then. The only thing fascinating about this book is how dumbed down America is to think this is good literature.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Don't know why, but I never heard of this movie before last weekend.  Just happened to see it while searching through available Amazon Prime movie listing.  Some of Tommy Lee Jones' best work.  Highly recommended.

0756405890|5.0|The Kingkiller Chronicles is an original and refreshing fantasy series. The prose is exceptional, the story is compelling, the plot is driven well, and the main characters complex. Rothfuss's world is amazing, and I will buy any book this man writes from now on.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Have been reading this series for years, gets better every time I read it. Than you for the first 2 books in this series for free. Beats carrying  book around any day
B005OZE9SA|4.0|It only took me 10 minutes to get this thing going, right out of the box. I utilize an Aspire One (so, no CD drive), so I downloaded the driver from [...], plugged everything in, and... voila! I was hooked up and recording. The quality of the recording is fantastic and the unit has a suave design. My only issue is a small touch of latency during playback, but it isn't a huge deal and I am going to research some possible solutions to that.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Funny and a awsome ending<br /><br />I can't wait for the 6th book and I can't believe how popular It's been

B00B5SJEOO|4.0|Basil Poledouris's music for \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" is as sweeping and majestic as (those who have seen the film, or definitely should) remember it to be in Arnold Schwarzenegger's breakout 1982 cult adventure classic.  For telling your friends or loved ones, the late James Earl Jones starred as the film's antagonist, Doom, who personally kills young Conan's family (*cough* the voice of Darth Vader *cough*).<br /><br />The 1982 score, which is much more memorable than 300 composer Tyler Bates's 2011 soundtrack for the Conan reboot (meh), evokes the spirit of Robert E. Howard's Conan stories with effortless verve and musical magic.  The songs are notable in a \\"Princess Bride\\" kind of way, by way of sound recognition.  Once you hear any one of the 16 tracks from outside your time listening to it, you'll know from where it originated. My personal favorite would be \\"Prologue/Anvil of Crom\\", as this introductory overture to the cult classic encapsulates why Conan is such a great mythical, swords-and-sandals character (albeit the primitive outlook and misogynist attitudes of the original stories are notable and dated).<br /><br />The reason why is simple: Conan is a bad-ass Cimmerian whose strength, leadership and taste for battle is unrivaled in the pulp serial/swords-and-sandals genre.  After all, Robert E. Howard single-handledly created this genre from the ground up in his home state of Texas, during his short life.  While not his only literary creation (Solomon Kane, Red Sonja and Krull come to mind), Conan is certainly Howard's most iconic.<br /><br />In regards to the difference between the CD release of \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" and the new MP3 version here on Amazon, there are four extra MP3's available on the MP3 download than on the CD release.  The Track list for the CD: 12.  The Track list for the MP3 Download: 16.  The track choice for the MP3 download is much more enjoyable, which is worth noting.  For those CD fanatics, go ahead and get the CD.  Just know thatyou will miss out on four extra tracks and a smaller price tag.  The download is, at most, five to ten dollars more affordable than the CD, at $9.49.  The CD (depending on which online or physical store you purchase it from) is usually between 12 and 20 dollars, plus shipping and handling.<br /><br />To wrap things up, the score for \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" is majestic and musical magic.  It evokes the spirit of Robert E. Howard's Conan stories with effortless verve and passion.  Those who are nostalgic about past-time, 1980's adventure films or would just like to listen to a good old-fashioned adventure-fantasy score should look no further.<br /><br />GR
B000FCKGPC|3.0|this is a book to answer certain questions about some of the characters and it moves slowly at times because of that.<br />the characters become more interesting because of this however.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This game was very challenging. The graphics were more than expected. The only downside being that occasionally one of the items will be covered by the timer bar.or the.left bar with the clues.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I like the several screens format, that I can mix and match different camera makers on the same page, It is fast to setup and very convenient to use. I wanted to try it, because I was using another IPcam viewer and I could not find the camera I was setting up, so I tryed Tinycam free version, and in five minutes I has evrething I needed, then I ordered the pro version, for the price you can't as for more, because it has all the features of a very expensive progam except the for price.

B007NESBK2|4.0|I was impressed by the quality video and audio.  Some may not think the concert is not energetic as it could have been.  However, are they really Sade fans?  True fans know what to expect from Sade's class of music and entertainment, therefore accept her as she is, &#34;beautiful.&#34; My heart still goes --- bump-pa, bump, bump (sounds like &#34;love is found&#34; - track 5).  This DVD is a keeper.

B004LROUNG|4.0|A little slow in the middle good ending. I have read most of your books and enjoyed them all. Thank you for all the fun l had reading them.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great movie! Kept me guessing the whole way through to the end. Denzel didn't play his usual good guy role but was great!
0316056871|5.0|The book took a long time to get here. It was only coming from New Jersey so I wasn't sure why it took so long.
B000H1RFKU|3.0|Plenty of others have summarized the film before and said whether or not they liked it or not so I will dispense with that and focus strictly on the quality of the transfer of the film to Blu Ray.  It's a 5 star movie but the transfer quality rates only 3 stars.<br /><br />'Training Day' on BluRay was better than I expected once the disc was in. The Mbps rate ranged between the low teens and mid twenties at best. You would expect to see a lot of grain in this film, especially because there were so many dark scenes but the transfer wasn't bad and had good, warm color grading, natural skin tones and was free from artifacts, dirt or ghosting. However, I did see in one scene where the car turns right in front of some overhanging phone/electric lines some very real stair-stepping in the lines themselves. My gut feeling is that the transfer to blu ray was just that, a transfer without any serious remastering. This means that the Standard Def version wasn't bad either and I doubt you would see much difference from the upgrade to Blu Ray.<br /><br />The lack of an upgrade of the audio bolsters my thoughts on this. The audio is lossy Dolby Digital 5.1. You can get used to listening to lossy audio until you hear the difference between it and a  lossless version. Very disappointed in the audio, not because the levels were poor or the dialogue unintelligible, but because the panning and use of the discreet channels for foley fx would have been greatly enhanced if the audio had been a lossless one. However, most of the audio is strictly across the front stage. Great movie though and too bad it was not really remastered. There were unfinished deleted scenes and an alternate ending scene as well as trailers, commentary and music videos.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksrrect path with this type of review.<br />Thanks

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent reading. Displays courage and faith that there is hope and survival after heartbreaking loss. Thank you for this inspiring novel.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|really enjoyed that movie, it had been a while since I saw an horror movie as good as that. The movie feels like 'nothing much' goes on, until you get to a later part where the main guys stumble in a lurid, old basement. Then  you understand what they really got themselves into.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like is that overall, I would have liked the  'bad guy' to be more mystical than physical.<br /><br />There's so many bad, dull, hyped horrors, such as 'Final Destination' or 'Scream'. 'Rec' is a very good one.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Season one was captivating. The episodes kept you wanting more. I'm glad I got to watch them back to back because I was really eager to see what was going to happen next.
B001H1SW4M|3.0|I think the best horrors are stories that somehow, seem plausible. 'Saw' isn't one of these stories. It's one of these movies where it seems for things to have worked backward, i.e. you start writing the plot from the end, then you work your way backward, cleverly adjusting the story with  events that seem to have been 'fished out' to accommodate the ending. It's hard to explain. It's as if I write a book and to state my message, I write the story to accommodate the message, in a way that's 'clever' but with no real skill. 'Saw' feels just like that, artificious, clever. It's like hearing a very difficult piece of music that emotionally doesn't do anything for you: you'd say 'clever' but not 'WOW! That gives me the goosebumps!'. The ending is rather ridiculous. It's delivered in a way that makes you go 'Ok, that was clever, big deal', but it's a type of cleverness that says 'I did that so that you can't say it's a bad movie'. But there's no real atmosphere, it's just a 'clever' story that in the end I'd pass up. Movies like these don't really do much for me.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George RR Martin is a master at intrigue and politics. The setting is almost secondary to the characters, gamesmanship and ever vacillating alliances.  Tons of fun to read.
B000YHE9J2|1.0|yawn. After seeing movies like 'Rec', or even respectably good horrors like 'Exorcist III' , movies like 'Final Destination' feels so boring, so forgettable, so dull, you wonder why you are wasting your time. I hate half-assed movies like this one. For reasons I don't understand, they are hyped, as well as movies like 'Screams'. On IMBD this film has a rating of 6.7.  A good movie like 'Exorcist III' is rated at 6, yet the latter blows 'Final Destination' out of the water. I'll go back to sleep.
0399536108|1.0|Don't waist you time unless you like to read about people bragging about themselves. The author just bashed the \\"norm\\" of working and education even though we all have to make money I felt he is preachy and implying his way is the best way. He has a master degree even though it was apparently as waist of his time. Then why did you do it? Just didn't get it! Nothing new or inspiring...
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|It's hard to control the ball for missile command game. Needs to be much better control for me to operate this game.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I have other versions but eventually decided I wanted to hear this cast.  When this recording first came out, I wasn't sure that Sutherland's voice was right for the role.  But she is excellent, everyone is excellent.  It's a performance that's big, even punchy, but well in control.
B005HSL626|4.0|Great game for kids. Easy to play and gets challenging as more fruit and bombs are thrown up.  my 3yr enjoys it.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This is a surprisingly well made thriller.  Acting, direction, cinematography, editing, production values — all are top notch.  The Blu-ray looks and sounds great.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I discovered Hugh Howey when I bought my kindle and I have been voraciously reading his stuff ever since !!! Wool is a great story. Imaginative, exciting, fast paced and heart breaking. It really doesn't disappoint. If you love The Stand and The Passage then you will love this although it is unfair to compare them as Wool stands alone as an original. I have ordered two copies of this in paperback for my friends. Buy Wool !
B007XF4J70|5.0|The film looks good in its restoration for Blu-ray.  Not quite perfect, but very good, with better blacks, etc.  Seeing it again after many years, I was struck by the underlying seriousness of what is essentially a romantic movie.  Some old films seem slow to contemporary eyes, but this one moves well and is just exceedingly well done.  The cast is fabulous, of course.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I am in love with this movie! Adam Sandler is my favorite actor, so having his voice in this makes it 100x better! It is a cute movie for the whole family to see and I got a great deal on it! Thank you!!!
B008YAPRPG|3.0|There are some interesting aspects to this film, but viewing it in 2013, I was surprised that it seemed slow, given its reputation as a dynamic film.  Also, although Gene Hackman is decent in the film, he because a much better actor later.  Overall it was a bit of a letdown.  But it looks good on the Blu-ray.
B000CNFC76|5.0|I am writing on Cliff's behalf to tell you how very much he enjoyed this movie and was telling us all about it on the weekend.<br />He asked us to order it for him but on the QT Roma asked us to do the same.  I know when he gets it on the 14th, he will be so thrilled.  Millie
B00B5HQL50|4.0|I love the movie but it kept stopping to reload, towards the end of the film it stopped more frequently.  It could have been my internet connection.  The picture quality was good, it wasn't fuzzy/pixelated.  I would recommend purchasing this movie off from Amazon Instant Video.

B009AMAGXK|5.0|This Valentine's Day, it's imperative that you see Beautiful Creatures because you want to celebrate this holiday that's totally in favor of only women in the best way you can. This movie reminds us all that true love is out there and possible, and available for the price of a totally over-priced movie ticket. So as you celebrate the love you have for your significant other--which was only suggested to you by lingerie companies advertising Valentine's Day erotic wear--enjoy this brilliant movie of rad amore.<br /><br />The story is an original work, even though it was lifted right off the pages of the novel by the same, darn name. Beautiful Creatures involves the story of a girl for whom love is impossible, mainly because she's frigid and a feminist, but also because she's a Caster, and her family's full of DARK powers. As a total coincidence--which has nothing whatsoever to do with a plot twist or plot furtherance--her 16th birthday approaches, when she's got to choose either the Dark Side of the Force or the Light Side of the Force.<br /><br />Being a Generation-Y teen who was raised in the entitlement era of the Obama administration and liberal ideology, however, Lena shows everyone when she decides to reject both sides! Instead, being the typical teenager today (selfish and self-centered, without any respect for hard work, values or merit), she simply has sex with every single male in the town of Gatlin. Then, she petitions the federal government to pay for all her birth control, even though Sandra Fluke was there and probably would have given her access to Plan B...maybe! In celebration of her efforts, Lena is given an award by both NOW and Planned Parenthood, and she gets a high five from none other than Obama himself (who just happens to be on a tour of Kenya). This movie was so good that it gave me goosebumps as I howled away in ecstasy and delight.<br /><br />This Valentine's Day, celebrate this greatest holiday of amore and lust in the purest way possible: By seeing a movie like Beautiful Creatures in order to pretend that Valentine's Day is anything but simply a contrived holiday invented by companies in order to market greeting cards, chocolates, flowers and teddy bears, which women use to get presents from men in exchange for intercourse.By seeing a movie like Beautiful Creatures in order to pretend that Valentine's Day is anything but simply a contrived holiday invented by companies in order to market greeting cards, chocolates, flowers and teddy bears, which women use to get presents from men in exchange for intercourse.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I got this movie to see more of what its like.<br /><br />I love this movies, simply awesome.<br /><br />I cant say what I dislike about it because its too cool.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for it was one of the top best Anime movies of the year it came out
B005LAIHU4|5.0|Folks, don't think for a second that Romeo and Juliet or even that medieval times rip-off called Tristan and Isolde is a great romance tale!! Nothing except for poppycock made by none other than the great genius of romance (or GGOR) himself, Nicky Sparks, can be considered anything close to what TRUE romance really is!<br /><br />It follows then that Safe Haven is the greatest work of art depicting true romance since Lady and the Tramp (now available on VHS and laser disc)! When I saw this early in the morning today, on Valentine's Day, I clutched the hand of my lover with more passion, desperation and tenderness than I ever have before. The reason for this effusive outburst of affection on my part obviously had to do with the high caliber of acting from the two leads, Joshie Duhamel and Julianne Huff, both of whom should be awarded the extremely prestigious Blockbuster Entertainment Awards for 2013!<br /><br />The story is highly original and not sappy at all because this is a Nicky Sparks story, and we all know that Nicky Sparks is the most thought-provoking and ultra-serious author on Earth...ever. Huff plays a prostitute who has become fed up with love because all the men she dates just want her for sex, even though she just doesn't know why!! Joshie, though, is the handsome john who sees through all her hooking and sees her for what she really is: A kind-hearted sex worker with a heart of gold and a penchant for voting Democrat. A match made in Heaven shortly follows.<br />Since this is a highly original and brainy movie, the climax comes when it's discovered that Huff's in a pinch that only Joshie can save her from. It turns out that her p/i/m/p wants to get back from her the Carl Jr.'s coupon that she stole from him, and he'll stop at nothing to get that deal that will get him a free Coke, free burger and free fries (with the purchase of a 10-piece chicken bucket, of course)!!<br /><br />I won't give away any spoilers, but let's just say that Joshie ends up saving Huff from her mean old p/i/m/p by explaining to him that Burger King offers better meal deals anyway, and that, therefore, he didn't need or want the Carl Jr.'s coupon anywho! The day is saved, as the p/i/m/p (turns out to be an Obama voter) leaves, thereby proving that Joshie saved the day! As his reward, Joshie gets sweet, sweet intercourse from Huff, which lasts for exactly 15, maybe 16 seconds. While watching that tender, tender love scene of passion, I'm not ashamed to admit that I experienced a lust emission myself.<br /><br />In short, please celebrate Valentine's Day the right way by enriching all the chocolate companies, greeting card companies and flower shops (all three entities invented the contrived holiday, by the way) with your hard-earned money. Then, snuggle close to your lover and watch Safe Haven until you become hungry and need to go to Carl Jr.'s for some TLC.aving Huff from her mean old p/i/m/p by explaining to him that Burger King offers better meal deals anyway, and that, therefore, he didn't need or want the Carl Jr.'s coupon anywho!

I waited forever to see what would happen at the Sheraton and by page 350 I was still waiting. Why The Panther was even alive was a mystery - even his own men and council didn't agree w/him. I also got a little tired of Corey cracking wise every two minutes - and the story was just too repititious. I liked the beginning and thought it would be a great read - I gave it 3* because I didn't read the entire book and maybe it got better.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Great read. And very funny too. I totally enjoyed this book. But am a Ozzy fan. Worth the money you will spend.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|First off let me say, Rest In Piece Chris Kyle.  Best I have read in a longtime. It makes me proud to be an American.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|The first part of this book was good, but gets boring by the end. Sad that kids can be raised like that.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I don't agree 100% with every word of Moran's philosophy, but her candid, honest take on what womanhood REALLY feels like (and really means) is both spot-on and incredibly moving. This book made me laugh, cry, think, and feel truly proud to be a woman. If you've ever found yourself feeling inadequate as a woman, or felt that you aren't a &#34;real&#34; woman because you aren't thin enough or &#34;cute&#34; enough, or thought you weren't &#34;allowed&#34; to be a feminist because you like high heels and pricey handbags, this one's for you! We're ALL women, we ALL count, and we need to remember that we're all in this together! Hear us ROAR!!! ;)
B00499NHLC|5.0|Who ever thougt annoying could be so fun. The best Sherlock series I've seen to date.<br />And I've seen them all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book. Can't wait to read the other two. It was so exciting that I was sneaking paragraphs at work.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Along with ALL other John Hughes's movies, no film education is complete without Ferris. It's a classic my whole family enjoyed (2 kids, 14 & 10). Don't miss it!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I have enjoyed all five books so far. George R. R. Martin is now one of my favorite authors. Can't wait for the next book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Unexpected episodes that left me thinking even a few days after watching.  I do not think any drama series can contour more reaction from its viewers as this show does. Watch all 3 seasons!
1926778537|5.0|this artbook is wel done , lots of details and weapons details , great prototypes for death...<br />personally i like it
B004DM0UII|5.0|Love the look, love the stations, love the breakdown, love the categories!  Highly recommended.  Who needs satellite radio when you've got XiiaLive Pro?  Buy once and get rid of monthly subscriptions.
1781164266|5.0|as long as im a big fan for DS series i recommend al the fans to get this book which is contain a lot of great sketches and designs for this amazing game
B008KW43TE|5.0|This lived up to the hype.  Not the best album I've heard this year, but a solid first album with a lot of diversity.
B006RBZV82|5.0|Certainly doesn't disappoint!!!!!<br /><br />It is basically the same as all the underwater shows on the Discovery Channel. If you like those, you will love this!
1451695195|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!  Loved this book!  This well educated neurosurgeon learned that some things are treuly REAL even though they are not concrete, cannot be held in your hand, measured, weighed, or proven by research.  Never the less, there are things that are REAL that are beyond our knowledge or comprehension, but that doesn't make them less REAL.  The author examined this subject scientifically & was amazed at this personal experience that he shares with us in his book.  It was a good book.
B00821OX98|5.0|I absolutely love falling skies. Usually sci fi isn't my thing but this show won me over. Would definitely recommend!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Another Black Keys great music CD!  Black Keys is good music.  Oops, sometimes a little too good for me...I seem to get involved in listening to them, my foot gets too heavy on the accelerator & the policeman was not very understanding about the speed limit....LOL!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|An excellent novel.  So unsettling that I was in a state apprehension for the wellbeing of the victims throughout the reading.  What an amazing woman was &#34;Ma&#34; and what an extraordinary child was Jack.
B005KELQEU|3.0|It looks good and is easily used.Fits in your hand well. I would buy this item for any one who has a kindle
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have trouble putting it down once I start playing, luckily at some point a battery has to die so I can get a break.
B00A4FOWYQ|3.0|This album has an 80's Madonna - and dare I say - Lady Gaga influence written all over it.  While I'm not exactly bowled over - there are quite a few mediocre songs -  I do like it. Can't say I appreciate the album cover, though - it looks generic.<br /><br />I had no idea the album would be ALL pop. They completely abandoned their indie roots, which I had come to love. I'm not worried - all artists eventually return to their roots. For me, this is a not-bad-but could-have-been-better deal. It's okay.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book. I would have preferred the main characters to be 21+.Yes, I know we have mature teenagers. In as much, as a parent the emotions were so strong as to be frightening. Molestation of the innocent is too prevalent in our society and is escalating.
B001UGB1X8|1.0|I watched it expecting some exciting twist in the plot all the way till the end....just to be let down.  This is not a typical Tommy Lee Jones' movie.  This movie had an attractive star lineup, with a story situated in Lousiana's Bayou - all elements that make one to expect a quality movie.  But, not this one.<br /><br />This movie revolves around a sheriff who is in search of a serial killer that goes around killing young women in Lousiana.  There is no plot per se:  The sheriff just goes around beats up people to get clues.  Also, a civil war era general mysteriously appears to give sound advice to the sheriff from time to time.<br /><br />You are better off spending your time on some other B grade movie.
B000CNFC76|4.0|I recommend this movie as a thoughtful, touching success story. It's really well crafted and will make you feel great after watching it.
B006OW817C|5.0|Beethoven: Diabelli Variations is a 2012 harmonia mundi recording starring pianist Andreas Staier. Michael Landenburger has written the music notes. Truly a great performance and one could say that he is a modern day Yves Nat. Absolutely brilliant! Highly recommended indeed! 5/5.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nothing you expect but yet peeks your interest from beginning to end. I thoroughly enjoyed this intriguing love story and definitely recommend it.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This book was terrible. I read it all the way to the end, in order to give it the best chance I could but it is formulaic to the point of the entire story reading as a checklist for what the Author believes constitutes a story. There is no depth, nothing substantial for the reader to hold onto. There is nothing here that makes you suspend your disbelief even for moment, allowing you to go along with the story. Instead every new plot development feels as though you are being wrenched in the direction the Author wishes you to go and it is most abrasive.This is the first time I have read this Author and I shall not do so again. I urge you to save yourself the time, money and frustration. Skip this book and Author, they are not worth it.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|Got this app to help with my kindles camera and have some fun. I didn't expect all the photos I took and looked at were upside down. Don't get
B00ABO573A|4.0|Keep the Lights On is a very real story, told on a very real level. A genuine portrayal of a modern day relationship, dealing with issues that arise out of substance abuse and codependence, in an otherwise loving relationship.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this temple run is just as good as the first one. The graphics are definitely better as well.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|the Kitchen House is  an historical fiction that takes place during the slave period.  The story is intriguing and takes unexpected twists and turns and very realistic.  If you enjoy reading about this period, you will not want to miss reading this novel.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have zero complaints! such a great app. much better than even the stock calculator on my phone. thanks so.much!
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Life of Pi set me up with the question if I am a nonbeliever, I will definitely change my mind after reading it.  I thought there would be a prophetic ending and all I received was lots of unanswered questions.
B00846F1YW|4.0|this game works well with my tablet and is fun to play sometimes its slow to load but worth the wait
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I absolutly loved this book.  It did take a few pages to actually get into but once I did I was hooked.  I am a huge dog lover.  I have 3 rescues that are wonderful.  If you at all like dogs then this is a book for you.  I must warn you that you will need a box of tissues toward the end of the book.  A good friend of mine recommended this to me and I am sure glad she did.  This was a very good story and I really can't say enough good things about the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A very good guide to understanding the super rich and wealthy way of life. Old money and traditions die hard. However there are many changes and forces in life that cannot be controlled or even predicted by anyone. And that is a blessing albeit sometimes a mixed one.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was really good.  I have already read Gillian Flynn's two other novels and this one is very good as well.  It is a very fast read and kept my attention from beginning to end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book would recommend it to anyone who wants to read it in the future. Loved every minute of it
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome book! Loved it and could not put it down.  It is the first of the 3 Gillian Flynn books I have read and I really hope she comes out with a 4th soon.  I read this in just a few days and was hooked by page 1.  Lots of twists and turns in this book which make for a great thriller novel.  You will not be sorry you got this book!!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love it too cute!!! It keep you very busy..I need staff help but not sure about spending the money.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I had just finished Gone Girl and then needed another quick read.  I downloaded Dark Places and I am really happy I did.  I thought this was also another great Gillian Flynn novel.  Granted,, in my opinion not as good as Gone Girl but still in the same genre without leaving you feeling like you are reading the same book with different characters.  Read this one then get Sharp Objects. You will have them all read within a week and you will be glad you did.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The fifty shades of grey trilogy is the best series I have ever had the privilege of reading! I am obsessed with the beautifully sweet erotic series. I want more, many more books by E.L. James! She is a brilliant author. I love her use of description. She explains everything fluently and beautifully that captivates you in the first several pages of the very first book. This genius woman should be proud of herself. I cannot wait to read more from her!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Really thought this was a great book and in my opinion it read like a movie.  Along the same lines as the Fifty Shades series and the Crossfire Novels.  It was a very quick read but very good.
B001EC3JME|5.0|HI,<br /> THIS HOLDER WENT ON A MINI MAG FLASHLIGHT. THE FIT WAS GREAT, NICE AND TIGHT. THE BELT CLIP WAS A GREAT FIT ON THE BELT. THE PIVOT CLICKS INTO POSITION AND HOLDS THE FLASHLIGHT SECURELY, AIMING IT IN A MULTITUDE OF ANGLES. WELL WORTH THE PRICE FOR HANDS FREE LIGHTING.  RECOMMENDED.<br />NOT SURE HOW IT WILL DO WITH A LARGER FLASHLIGHT THOUGH.
B004J4WLPU|3.0|After reading Gone Girl I was excited to read another novel in the same genre.  This one however was a bit disappointing.  The book took a little longer to finish since there is little dialogue and more description on each page.  The over all story grabbed me in the beginning and kept me interested for about half of the book.  The second half was long and drawn out and I just felt like , &#34;please tell me who did it already.&#34;  I did not like the ending at all.  I thought it was too simplistic for a mystery novel and too easy.  I am don't think this one I will be recommending to a friend.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a fun game did not know what all the fuss was about with Angry Birds now I know.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I had just finished all three of Fifty Shades novels and then went on the Bared to You.  My opinion is that it did have a lot of similarites as Fifty Shades but written much better.  I think the writing seemed more grown up to me and a bit more believable.  I have not yet read the follow up, Reflected in You, but I am hoping that one is just as good.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|This is a slim book but very interesting as an exploration of the end of life by someone who is under no illusions that the end means anything more than the end.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Loved this book.  Very quick read due to the great story line.  Granted it may have been a little far fetched at times but that is what makes a great novel, right?  The story was intriguing and I read every line and read it fast so I could see what happened at the end.  I have recommended this book to many people and they have also loved this book.  Download it now!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Get it you will love this series. Some of the best acting I've seen in years.I CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON FOUR.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Lol that was a good book I enjoyed the part when the at' s shifted into the au's very suspenseful
B00ANW33CM|1.0|First of all, this game didn't download at all - I had to contact Amazon to find the place to try again to download it.  It was a VERY slow download on my Droid Global 2, even with a network connection.  Installation was also slow.  After it was finally installed, every time I attempted to open it, it went to black and froze.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Suzanne Collins had it going on with the first installment of the series, but seems to lose steam as the following two books progressed.  Not to spoil the book for readers, but suffice it to say that the author pushed through the climax in record time and left me feeling that a lot of interesting plot and character closure was left unfinished.  As I read the last page, I found myself wondering how the movie screen writers are going to deal with their project and potentially improve on a rather unsatisfying experience.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much and found myself trying to predict what was really going on--keep reading--it's really worth the denoument!
B000002KFJ|5.0|Number Six, six s.. you get the idea. Except this brilliant album comes with a creative and spiritual twist. I'm I going insane...should be in the Hall of Fame. Maybe not Ozzy. Well, the Band sure is!
B00A6D5GBE|2.0|66MB in size!  Even a full 3D game like Deer Hunter is less than half that at 30MB. Needs some more efficient coding and a look at graphic resolution sizing.
B00000DOYL|5.0|Awesome. It was wrapped like new. By far the best &#34;not as common Led Zeppelin albums&#34;. They just got better and better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great show, great actors, great story, you get to leave your life behind for a while (which is wonderful even if you have a great life) and get lost in Downton Abbey.  That is what a great story should do.  It does it every show.  Thank you to all involved in making this show possible.
B000002KDO|5.0|...and soon the WORLD will LOVE you sweet leaf. Of ya baby.  True words by masters in their own right.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|Hard to play on the Kindle Fire. Flippers not in a very good spot.  But it was free so what can you expect
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Like new. Awesome. They just keep getting better and better.  R.I.P. Rev! Self titled...enough said. Brilliant can't wait to their next album.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book. It is impossible to put down. It leaves you guessing and hoping through the whole book. It has a shocking ending as all the best book do. It is perfect for a book group discussion.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|This heavy master piece proves that Metal is alive and still kicking...KICKING ASS!!! Only four songs? Why yes. That's because they are EACH as long as an entire pop/rap CRAP ALBUM. So 'tallica &#62; 4 pop &#34;groups&#34;.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great book.  True love story.  Can't wait to see the movie.  I hope the actors can pull this book off.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Like new. Awesome. They just keep getting better and better.  R.I.P. Rev! It's brilliant. Can't wait to their next album.
0671646788|1.0|I had been under the impression this book was focused on entrepreneurs, and not only corporate individuals. Well if you were expecting another entrepreneurial advice book like I was, do not buy this. This is strictly focused on how to get ahead in the corporate rat race. If that is your profession though, I recommend it.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|Like new. Awesome. They just keep getting better and better.  R.I.P. Rev! It's brilliant. Can't wait to their next album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Theres so many twists in this book that it keeps you on the edge and you cant put it down.
B000002KET|5.0|Number five and still alive! Shoot, I lot more than just alive...alive and kicking ASS! R.I.P. Bill. Rock on Tony!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies, its entertaining, wholesome and funny. great for all ages. i highly recommend it.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|As a long time RT devotee, I'm going with other reviewers who've said this is his strongest work since Rumour and Sigh.  I think he's been drinking from the same well that saw Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt and Sinead O'Connor produce such terrific work in 2012.  Every track, acoustic or electric, crackles and sparks.  And \\"Another Small Thing in her Favour\\" has to be one of RT's most biting numbers ever, as well as being a look-back-in-anguish perspective that rivals the Kinks' \\"Property\\" (off [[ASIN:B0002PUH9W State of Confusion (Hybr) (Dig)]] ).
B008133MDK|5.0|As a Sherlock Holmes fan and having seen just about every iteration of the literary legend portrayed in film and on television I think that this is the best version yet. Bring on season 3 and beyond!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I am so in awe of Navy Seals and this man is definitely awe inspiring. He was a true soldier with a very difficult job yet he did it then came home to be a loving husband and father. This book is so gritty and honest.  I pray for his wife and children having just lost him. Praise God for men like Chris Kyle.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Now you know why the Black Keys won a Grammy!  This is an awesom rock album.  It is a must own.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|By far the best book I have read in a long time it's the first sparks book I have read and loved every word of it. Will recommend to EVERYONE!!
B00AHXDECG|4.0|I can play the whole album without skipping any songs...enough said! There aren't many albums being released these days with more than 3-4 good songs.  This album exceeded my expectations.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|The only season of Glee worth watching is the first. Good start to a show. The show was really good. Watch the the other seasons and you will see how bad this show sucks now. This isa very funny show. If you like Glee get this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love all the books. They have everything you need. Love, adventure, mystery, crime, kinkyness. Loved the story lines never got boring. I kinda fell for Mr. Grey.
B000Q66PXE|4.0|This was when HBO had good shows. Trying to make a comeback now. This series was very good. The First season was very good and deep. It had more action and the acting was very well done. Mostly a political show that showed how they did things. A lot of sex and violence and coarse language in both seasons. The second season was good but not all that. It fell off at times. Cleopatra and Mark Anthony story was lacking. Ending was not all that but still a very good series to watch.
092389165X|5.0|First read this when I was a kid, it had a serious impact on me in high school; really brought home the aftermath of the war.  My family lost nearly everything in the Colorado wildfires in 2012, I felt a strong need to find a replacement.  This book has straightforward, simple, lean written accounts from the people who experienced the bombing in Japan.  The image of the women walking down the road, their skin hanging of them like the folds of their kimonos, and imprinted with the patterns of the clothes they'd been wearing...indelible.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Each episode was really good, keeps you on the edge of your sit.  Cannot wait to watch season two, should be as good as first season.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|This is the best weather app that I know of on the market for Android. Now the only thing that is needed is a widget for the lockscreen.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great pace, character cast. I love that no one is safe here, no superheroes that save the day time after time. This show shows (yes, I meant to do it) that even zombie genre can be fun when done right.
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent read ... I couldn't put it down.  More elaborate than the movie.  A true treasure hunt of sorts.  Great.
B000I5SY9Q|4.0|This is a really insightful movie in which my interest was sparked by the reference to it in \\"Zeitgeist - The Movie\\". If I had known back when this came out what I know now, it would have meant that much more back then. This is a great movie to rekindle a love for.. A Classic!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was not realistic enough even for those that are into that kind of relationship. It was not good enough to bother with the sequels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I this game is fantastic and i recommended it for anyone and love when you get the different types of mystery
B00280LYIM|4.0|I thought this book was very interesting and I was hooked the whole way through I definitely recommend this book!

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Amazing!!!!!! Couldn't put tell book down finished it in a day a half. Highly recommend this book for people to read
B000059HB7|5.0|My wife asked me to look into getting this movie. The price was right, the delivery was nearly instantaneous, and the DVD performed well. Thank you Amazon for your help in this. Also, the story was cool.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is just the best game ever it has all kinds of blocks and etc.<br />and I love the updates buy it! now
B009JBZH54|5.0|Having never watched the newer batman movies and getting this set for a steal was all worth it.<br />This is the first blueray dvd set that I had purchased and WOW what a difference blueray makes!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The book ended very differently than I anticipated.  I enjoyed the adventure and was relieved to see it filled the gaps in book one.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is an awesome game! The graphics are fantastic and the concept of the game is amazing. It just takes some brain power and it will have you addicted. It is really worth the money to see how good your puzzle solving skills really are. Give it a try. You'll be happy you did.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|It has been & always will be my most Favorite game ever. I grew up playing it with my family & now I play it with my family.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is fun for the whole family to play it gets very challenging as level progress son gets frustrated but we love it!!!

B00846F1YW|5.0|Playing on kindle fire hd 7 inch. Flawless play. Sharp clear pictures to search. Great story line. Looking forward to more!!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I enjoyed this book, Ms. Flynn showed she is more then a T.V. reviewer. I don't know where she got the stuff she writes in this book, but I am glad I didn't grow up in her town or time
B0053O89JM|5.0|This last season of House was awesome!  Unexpected &#34;visitors&#34; & suspense, just what House has always offered.  I'm sad that the series has ended, but I have the whole series on dvd and I can revisit it whenever I want. 5 stars, 5 stars, 5 stars!!!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Fun to watch, i am addicted. Cannot wait for next season, bummed it costs to view season 5 wish it were free with prime.
B008476HBM|4.0|The book was ok.  It was just a little drawn out for me.  I doubt that I would read it again.
B0035YTG30|5.0|Great movie. Love AH. Sweet love story, honorable behavior, very old school. Wish there were more movies like this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks's words are both beautiful and astounding. I can't wait to see this movie with my man on Valentine's Day!
B003DCPGNS|4.0|Great movie. Love KH.  Sweet love story, a bit silly, very old school. Wish there were more movies like this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best effing game ever!!!!!!!!!!! i luv this game worth the money.. can't wait til it comes out with an update
B005HSL626|3.0|Good simple game, but just as all the fruit comes across the screen during Fruit Freenzy, my Kindle won't recognize my strokes.  So frustrating!!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great game to kill time just too many facebook updates other than that every fun game. Good job guys. That is all.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This game is so addictive, it has kept my wife up all hours of the night playing the stinking thing.  She loves it, but hates it, too.  After 25 years of marriage I wonder if this says more about our love life than I'm willing to admit.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I am not an iTunes fan so the hoops I had to jump thru to get my digital copy really put me off.<br /><br />The DVD is great; worth the money.  Just wish getting a digital copy was a more straight forward process.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I downloaded dolphin solely so i could watch flash videos on my KF HD. The browser is constantly freezing, or not responding. If im lucky enough that i dont have to power down the entire tablet, the audio feed from the browser continues despite the program being exited completely. REALLY annoying! I hope they fix these bugs. I only use it when I really want to watch a video.
0142418471|5.0|This is the story of Will Grayson. Well, actually it's the story of Will Grayson and the other Will Grayson. Though their names might be the same, the two teenage boys couldn't be more different. One Will Grayson abides by a philosophy of apathy and silence, a mere shadow to his flamboyantly gay and very large BFF, Tiny Cooper. The other Will Grayson is a closeted gay loner who lives in a fog of angst and depression. The boys meet in a chance encounter and as their worlds collide, their lives are forever changed.<br /><br />It may shock and appall you to know that I've never read a John Green book before. Oh the horror! And as a Green newbie, I couldn't be happier that Will Grayson, Will Grayson was my first. Co-written with David Levithan, Will Grayson, Will Grayson is a hilarious romp featuring love, teenage drama, Tiny Cooper and the most epically gay musical you'll ever encounter. After being completely blown away by Levithan's, Every Day, I had no doubt that this book would leave me reeling. It totally did. Written in alternating perspectives, each chapter explores the life of a Will Grayson. Eventually, we see that their lives converge in a strange twist of fate and just how this meeting irrevocably impacts each of the Will's lives for the better.<br /><br />What's most outstanding about this book, the brilliant concept aside, is the collaborative success of David and John's writing. Each in a distinctive voice uses their Will to narrate in a very believable and impactful way. John's WG is caught up in finding himself amidst being overshadowed by his very charismatic friend. He is the average teen whose motivations are steeped in typical teenage problems. In short, he's so easy to connect with because we've all been there and done that. Levithan's WG, on the other hand, is more of a broken soul. He struggles with depression and his self awareness makes him antagonistic, at best. As raw as this WG is, he's also blatantly honest and as a reader, you find yourself rooting for him to overcome all the crap that permeates his life. About the only thing both WG's share (prior to their meeting) is their struggle to find and understand first love. Because as much as Will Grayson, Will Grayson is about growing up and finding yourself, at its core, it's a novel about love --- finding love, falling in love, platonic love, familial love and self love. And that, my friends, is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />So, this book has gotten its share of accolades but it's also gotten a lot flack for the over-the-top cheesiness of the ending. Everything that happens culminates in the performance of the gayest musical of all time. No, really, I'm not exaggerating this part. It is the gayest musical of all time. Yes, it's cheesy. Yes, it's over the top but that's the point! It's supposed to be! I don't think the book's critical message could've been delivered in any other way. You'll still catch me shouting out, \\"I APPRECIATE YOU, TINY COOPER!\\" from time to time. It brought me to tears (happy ones, of course!). And Tiny Cooper. OMG, let me talk about Tiny Cooper for a second. How do I even begin to describe Tiny Cooper?<br /><br />\\"Tiny Cooper is not the world's gayest person and he is not the world's largest person, but I believe he may be the world's largest person who is really, really gay, and also the world's gayest person who is really, really large.\\"<br /><br />He is AH-MAZING. He's big, beautiful, he loves love and he's probably the best character ever written. Like EV-ER. The fact that he wants to use love, more specifically his very active love life via a musical, to make the world a better place, is just awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Tiny Cooper is the force to bring both WG's together. He's the main catalyst that incites radical changes in each of their perspectives. And with the problems that these two are facing, it takes a larger-than-life personality to do so. I'm just glad they picked a very fabulous one. In our increasingly acceptingsociety, there's still a sad shortage of strong and relatable GLBT characters so I have to applaud Levithan and Green for making Tiny Cooper and one of the WG's so amazing. This just adds fuel to the awesomeness that is this book. Will Grayson, Will Grayson overall is raw, honest and funny. It can be offensive at times, but that just lends to its charm and adds to the freshness of its edgy, yet beautiful message. For this reason, it may not be a book that everyone can enjoy but it's a book that everyone should read because you'll be thinking about it long after you've turned the last page. You can't pick which books make you happy, but you can pick happy books so save yourself the trouble and pick Will Grayson, Will Grayson.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Will Grayson, Will Grayson is an incredibly funny and insightful book that touches on issues to which everyone can relate, most notably love. The characters are relatable, the writing edgy and the concept fresh. And there's also Tiny Cooper! Tiny Cooper is reason enough to read this book. He's just awesome. Levithan and Green are a dream duo when it comes to creating an impactful reading experience that will stick with you long after you've put it down.society, there's still a sad shortage of strong and relatable GLBT characters so I have to applaud Levithan and Green for making Tiny Cooper and one of the WG's so amazing.

B00526ZKYS|4.0|Love this story. I caught my attention from beginning to end.<br />I made me wonder what could happen if something like this happens here.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Great movie! Very funny.  One of John Hughes' best. Also, gives a great perspective of Chicago in the 80's. Gen X favorite!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is an awesome boxset (BR), I recommend everyone to buy it... Este es un gran boxset (BR), Se lo recomiendo a todos para que lo compren.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great fun with this game. However, the coin regen rate could be ALOT faster. I often use up all 51 of my coins and have to put Coin Dozer down for several hours while I wait for more coins to regenerate in order to play. I'm not satisfied with a coin here and there regenerating - it's just too slow. Currently my coins regenerate every 30 seconds or so but I would love it if the regen time was cut in half. It's a fun pasttime but I'd like to be able to play for longer than five or ten minutes in a sitting. Despite that, I hate to put it down and will pick it right back up as soon as I have some coins to play with!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|This is an awesome boxset (BR), I recommend everyone to buy it... Este es un gran boxset (BR), Se lo recomiendo a todos para que lo compren.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing!! It usually takes me forever to read books, but it only took me a couple days to read this one. I'd be at school wanting to go home just to read it! Hopeless is definitely one of my favorite books and it is definitely a must-read!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is perfect. It has options that allow me to keep track of every activity for the whole family. It allows for all the variations for repeats that I need. I usually don't write reviews but this one is so worth the effort. I really love all the options available. Other aps who want to be like this one should take their lessons from here.

B003O86FMW|4.0|My wife would have rated it three stars. I give it four because I did enjoy the book. But rather than reveal the secrets a little at a time along the way, it held everything back and spilled the beans all at once at the end. Seemed a little rushed.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Really an interesting season, would recomend to people who like sience fiction, or time travel.  Very well written. Loveed it
B00846REIS|2.0|If your looking for a raunchy romance this book is for you. I didn't really like the story line and it really didn't have much of a plot. I'm not a big romance reader either though but I think this book is very overrated. 50 shades was written better.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Firefly is an incredible show that had such great potential for a multi-season program. But like always with Sci-fi, when they get something good, they toss it for something lousy. This was great from the first moment to the very last episode. It actually leaves one saddened for the premature loss of something that could have been better.<br /><br />It was awsome to see firefly reborn briefly with the new sci-fi show, Battlestar Galactica -- the scene of ships flying by when Rosslyn learns she has terminal breast cancer prior to going out to the Galactica -- they give a fairly clear bit of homage to firefly with the firefly looking like it was heading in for a landing.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see any of Firefly's future incarnations, and one would hope future movies straight to disk.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can't remember the last time I've been this caught up in a book. Fascinating themes touching on the nature of humanity, the uses of technology, the limits of leadership and individual sacrifice. Intriguing plot twists, character development and plenty of moral dilemmas. Science fiction, with a dash of horror.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It's about time we had an answer to X-files!!!!! This show is intriguing. It's an awesome display of theoretical science!! Keeps your brain working. I personally love it!!!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I heard of this band thanks to \\"Kill Your Heroes\\" being released on Nintendo Video, actually. I decided to take a look at them and found that I love them! I just had to buy the CD, and I'm glad I did.<br />Definitely needed to take a second look at nearly every song on this album, including Sail. I recognized Sail so I guess I heard it in the past, but never really took to it. After a while I found I liked it just as much as the others. Not enjoying people complaining that the rest of the album sounds different from that one song. The lead singer said in an interview, supposedly, that they considered \\"Sail\\" one of their weirder songs and never expected it to get that popular. They weren't trying to fool anyone.<br />Each track is the kind of song that has so many good parts that I'll rarely find myself skipping tracks. I really enjoyed Knights of Shame as a song that has a little bit of everything. The songs I immediately loved were Kill Your Heroes, Jump on my Shoulders, Wake Up and All I Need. The rest followed suit. Burn it Down was one that I really disliked at first, but now hold as one of my favorites. Go figure. The only song, truly, that I'm having a hard time loving is Soul Wars (for some reason). All of the others are fantastic and I have nothing but good things to say.<br /><br />Cannot wait for their next album!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The beginning is slow so I didn't know what all the hype about this book was about. Trust me once you reach 80 pages in you can't put it down. It keeps you guessing and guessing til the very end of the book. One of the best books of all time.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|If yoy enjoy JRPGs at their finest, this game is totally for you. It's easy to find yourself sinking hours of your time grinding to get your kob levels or character levels up. The dialogue may be a little childish and unforthcoming, but the game overall is solid.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This author takes you into the world she creates in a way that has you walking beside the characters. Wonderful reading time!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This version comes with the Christmas proposal special. Great show. Love that I can watch over and over again on my schedule!
B007LB2B3K|4.0|Very happy with this album. Great crossover of genres. Definitely seeking out their previous efforts. Radio tracks are only the beginning, many other great songs on this disk.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love the show, love the DVD. Recomend to have all seasons to watch on nessecersary stay in-door winter days. Also good to watch over and over on your own schedule and time.
B003MS7V8G|3.0|This was in the genre of the classic art house foreign film - South American sensuality with a charm and sweetness that masks the cliche plots.  Penelope is the fantastic but the entire cast is sincere in their efforts.  Not a film you would give an award to but good for an enjoyable, romantic evening!
0525953728|3.0|More about the author than about the acctual events, somwehat self-serving.  Certainlydidn't reveal any &#34;secrets&#34;.Prettyquickread and somewhat repetitious. That's it
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love evernote on windows, the web, my kindle and my phone. It is a super useful tool and I have been a premium User since 2010.
034580404X|4.0|Very repetitious and really unbelievable.  However, as a sexual fantasy, it is a fun read and only shocking to the sexually naive.You need an open mind to enjoy. It's really porno, but fun.
B005KIQ1C8|5.0|My grandson (6) loved this Christmas present.  It took him just a couple of hours to build the whole thing.  He is quite the Lego expert.  He is happy so I am happy.
0545265355|4.0|Once you accept the original premice, very attention holding,  Easy read.  Shocking in some of the concepts.  Very easy and quick read.
145210655X|5.0|I got a kick out of reading this. Many of the things single parents with a small boy deal with are in this book, with Darth Vader as the single parent and using quotes from the Star Wars movies as part of the punch lines.<br /><br />If you are a Star Wars fan, it is definitely worth reading.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Still tring to figure out how to use it.  Had some difficulty getting a new password when I forgot the old one, but up and running now.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a bit of a weird book.  Maybe I should say story.  I was not sure I liked the way it switched back and forth between the characters.  I did enjoy the read.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Really like it.  Can hold it upright or stand it on its side to read or use any other apps I have on it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed this story and was not ready for this ending.  I wish the author had gone a bit further.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A real thriller with a real surprise ending. Who knew jo was a figment?  Alex was the perfect hero. I was on edge through the whole masterpiece.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Okay, not great. Corny and poorly written in some places. Don't think I'm going to read the next two. K
B005LAII80|5.0|If it weren't for the classics like Die Hard, I'd say this is the best action movie I've ever seen. Its perfectly cast, acted and definitely a labor of love with respect for the source material. Not a single action scene is thrown in needlessly; whenever someone's head is blown off it furthers the plot directly in some way. This movie knows its audience and caters to it without pandering. Anderson and Dredd have an excellent dynamic and Lena Headey excels as a villian as always.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Good interesting book.  Didn't want to put it down until the end.  Recommend everyone to read these series.  To bad this is the last book
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about this series is exemplary - the acting, the location, the clothes, and the story line. Can't wait for Season 4.
B00957T6X6|4.0|Liked the series can't wait for the next one. Hopefully it will come out sooner than later. I can't wait.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Ed Sheeran is a great singer and really nails the songs on this album.  He is a very diverse singer and his songs range from Folk, acoustic, hip-hop, to grime.  My favorite song is Drunk, mostly because of the music video with the cat.  Many of his songs are very sad or down-trodden.  This CD was a great buy.
0545265355|5.0|love it,hated when i finished last page, Katniss is the new superhero, fiction at its best,read it if you haven't
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I chose this rating because the songs and Rod's singing style appeals to me. I have loved him since I was 16 (back in the 70's! so I&#34;m old lol) and my husband has started really loving him too esp. since we saw him in concert in 2012! If you don't like Rod's raspy voice, you wouldn't be here so I'm sure you will love this CD as much as we do:) My husband even put a copy in the car for us to listen the other day (it's Feb now!) because he enjoyed it so much:)
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|With this film Daniel Craig takes full ownsership of the Bond character. A simply superb movie all the way around.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|besides the physics being unreliable; the gameplay lags; ads are in the way; more ads pop up when playing; some levels are extremely easy to the point where you can't not get three stars; and some levels are impossible to get three stars on even when you destroy everything with only one bird.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|It's working as soon as set up right out of box, no yet try advance setting. But was doing really good on DUST with many kills, need to try on other games to see how it work.<br /><br />Only little issue was the aim/look around, it's like other peoples says, was little lag but guess was due to not doing the advance setting yet.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I ordered aelectronic for my Kindle  Fifty Shade of Grey I was charged $60.99 the price was $8.99 I have not recived it my Kindle would not pick it up.  The price you charged is for the book, I have not recived the book.  You have got my money on hold, I am not very happy I ordered a book for my Kindle you have go my money on hold were is the book.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This quickly became my daughters movie of choice!  Now it is McQueen everything.  She is almost 3 so we watch it almost everyday.  Thank goodness it is one of those movies that never gets old :)  We often pick it for family movie night.
0439023521|5.0|Got caught up in this book but thought it would be a teens choice.  It's full of excitement with a new theme that is both edgy and at times gory, seems like it could come true in the future!  Can't wait for the next one
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It works.  It does what you want for the most part, but it freezes sometimes.  And pictures and videos can take awhile to upload even when you have wifi
1594135851|5.0|Loved the excitement in this book.  Got caught up with the first one and it continues...............  Can;t wait for the next one and then the movies to come!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's Kindle for your smartphone!  How can you go wrong?  Easy to use and lots of books and more available.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I haven't gotten through the whole game yet but, it seems to be very colorful on my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; and it holds my attention.  I will probably purchase other games from Nevosoft in the future.  This game was a freebie and just wanted to download something on my new Kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it.  Rented season 1 &2.  Sorry about the way it ended but have heard British actors get killed off easily.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Husband loved it.
0345803485|1.0|Well, I was curious, so I bought it.  It's a very good story line even without the sexual parts.  But, I won't be reading any more of them.
B00867GJYK|4.0|finally!! i was wondering why nemo wasn't out on blu ray!<br /><br />only disappointment is though, this doesn't contain partysaurus rex toy story toons!<br />my son was looking forward to seeing it again....
159413586X|5.0|Hate to see this series end but, hear there will be a movie.  I think it woudl make a good TV series.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game.  The change from pigs to monkeys is great!  I've had so much fun playing this.  I'm going to recommend it to my friends.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|This app would not load on my kindle fire, I am very upset with this product and would definately want my money back!! Do not waste your money and time on this very poor game!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Fastest computer i Have built so far. (of 3 over the years)<br />came with heatsink and fan + thermal paste already on the heatsink.<br />My first APU build, and no worries so far... about 3weeks in now.
B0026PA05M|5.0|I waited for this album to go down in price forever. I have been listening and loving everything they put out since the beginning. I bought Mz. Hyde when it first came out and waited patiently until this one went down in price. When it finally, I snatched it up so fast.
B005J4ASDG|5.0|I had no idea that when I purchased this album that it is a live performance.  This is by far Howard Shore's greatest compositions.  You can feel the emotion and excitement of every movement and compare it straight to the movies.  Every movement is perfectly conducted.  I just cannot say anything negative about this piece of work.  I would highly recommend this to any LOTR fan!!!
0812992784|5.0|There's not much of a review required for such a well respected author but I do encourage this for a good read. The book cover is stunning and it's juustt the right size for reading on the subway or travel. It's smart, it's interesting...read it.
B009GEFXLC|3.0|When Castle first aired, it was fresh, funny, and fanciful (a novelist who brought his writer's imagination to the case). I would have rated it 4 or 5 stars then. It is still an enjoyable and entertaining show, but there is less emphasis on the writer's skills, less interaction with his daughter and mother (which was truly fun to watch), the writing is not always fresh at this point--something any television show has to struggle with after several seasons. The way the murders are solved is a bit predictable--the first suspects are never the killer. However, we keep watching because there is still a good deal of character development for the ensemble cast; there are still surprising plot twists and continuing story lines, and in the end we really like the actors and the characters they play.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|My wife and I started watching from season 1 about 3-4 weeks ago, and we have made it all the way through 6 season. This show is very funny and now we can't wait for it to come on tv.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Had I not seen the Alien series first I might have liked this a bit better. The God dude breaking off into little pieces spreading out into the earth seemed to much like Scientology to me. I guess after a while you get jaded, good special effects but I've seen better. It was OK just glad I didn't pay theater prices to see it.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|Chose this rating because it is one of my all time favorite movies. I like everything about the movie, makes me want to go out and chase tornadoes right now. Would recommend this movie to everyone.
B00ARAO720|4.0|Jacob Gorgon Levett has to many darn names. That a side it was a good movie. Fast paced, a bit over the top to be believable  but a good flick.
B0076L9W9Q|1.0|Terrible, just terrible. There is nothing more I can say about this group except that they are a waste of space in any sort of media outlet. I don't even understand why I am wasting my time writing this review. I'm out.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Flight was a great movie.  No problem viewing it on amazon.  I love that you have new releases available right away.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton fans will be happy to read this book.  I love Kate's writing.  She weaves stories together from the past to the present in such a way that it is seamless and easy to follow.  My friends and I love her books and share them between us.  If anyone asks about a new book to read I tell them to read anything by Kate Morton and they will love it and they do.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game for exercising the mind in a low key way.  It makes you think and simultaneously clears your thoughts.  I find this game to be a great way to relax.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|My first Baldacci book was Absolute Power.  I raced through the book until I finished it.  It was the same with The Innocent.  I could not wait to see what happened next but then the book was over and I was not ready for it to be.  I look forward to the next Baldacci book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game makes you think, especially if you try to complete the task in the minimum number of moves.  If you get stuck, hints are available, which is a nice feature.  I find this to be a relaxing way to exercise the mind in a low key manner.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I spend hours on Pinterest each week.  I am so inspired by the posts and have used many of them.  I have spent a few weekends having Pinterest project weekends where I go from one to another.  I will say that most of them have worked out and only a couple did not.  I love the recipes - we have been part of a supper club for almost 20 years and I find so many new recipe ideas that I have made each month.  We recently bought a lake house and I have gotten lots of ideas for decorating the interior.<br /><br />I am also a jewelry maker and have found many ideas to make or remake jewelry for family and friends.<br /><br />At first I spent more time surfing the website than doing projects.  Now I spend about equal time pinning and making the projects.  I look forward to sitting down each evening and seeing what people I follow have pinned and then head off to Popular to see what is new.
1933865474|5.0|I am an artist and a big reason I bought this was to learn better how to draw comic book vixens. This book has helped tremendously. Bruce Timm obviously has a Masterful understanding of the female form and every page is ripe with character. I have quickly became a huge fan of his work and I would highly suggest this book for anyone who likes his work at all.
B007R0WHMK|2.0|When I saw the original reviews it appeared about rivalry between perfume makers in 17th century Paris. Instead it is abut a serial killer with no sense of reality.
B00846F1YW|3.0|The app was fun but the bar the timer was on was in the way of some of the objects you needed to find. It is also hard to get some of the objects.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've loved this book. It was my first attempt to read a book before seeing the movie. I hope the movie lives up to the book!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I saw parts of &#34;live in London&#34; on a local PBS TV station.  I had to have it.  The music is soothing, thought provoking, and has a touch of blues.  I would highly recommend this cd to everyone.
B0076DELIG|1.0|The bl<br /><br />Another good mystery by Michael Connelly<br />I Have yet to find a book by him that I didn't enjoy.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a great oldie but it's still a goody. His point of veiws are stupid but so funny. It's worth the watch you'll never forget it and will want to own it.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|I love this app. I'm so happy Twitch made an app. I can watch all my SC2 and LoL and other stuff in bed now. It's awesome
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love it can't wait for the movies it had me mesmerized from the beginning..I guess you could love someone and not know it till after
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I wish it wasn't so expensive, but it's totally worth it. I even already have this game on DS but I bring around my tablet way more often than my DS nowadays. This game works perfectly too, I haven't had any weird crashes or anything, which is a lot to be said for mobile apps these days.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|the story is the best I've seen in a long time. it keeps ypu on your toes and always guessing whats next
B000YIGNKE|5.0|The 1995 version starring Amanda Root has long been one of my favorite Austen movies. In that context, it's a bit of shock to watch this newer version because the casting is so different and, for the most part, inferior. That is, except for the two lead roles. Penry-Jones puts in an excellent performance throughout. But Sally Hawkin's performance is just breathtaking; she carries the whole movie to something much better than what we have a right to expect from these production values. Indeed, this is one of those rare instances in film when an actress gives a performance so riveting that it's hard to see how she or anyone else could have improved upon it. Bravo.<br /><br />In looking over these reviews, I see there are two camps on the screenplay and its departure from the original novel. I personally think we're better off encouraging screewriters to liven up the orignal material, at least to a certain extent. This version certainly does that to great advantage, and I like the different emphasis put on Penry-Jones dillemma with the Musgrove girl. A truly excellent film!
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Harvey is a classic stage play that was put on film.  I wish there were more movies like this available in theaters now.  Obtained it for my grandchildren to view to show that movies actually can have a plot and be funny without gratuitous violence, car chases and sex.
B0036SUQWA|5.0|This is such a fun movie. I have seen it 4 times and just watched it again last night. For people who like Coen Brothers type comedy this is brilliant. It investigates the psychic research being done in the army. This is a great cast. The movie improves upon the book by overlaying a plot a streamlining the characters and pushing up the humor level.<br />Watch the special features interviews with the real people the movie is based on. You can also find books that were written by them on Amazon.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I'll watch anything with Maggie Smith, but this is an amazing and charming performance. However, Pauline Collins and Billy Connolly steal every scene they are in! Set in a retirement home for British musicians, this sweet, funny, touching film has something for everyone. The characters are charming and engaging, but the script does not make them buffoons or treat them as stupid children. You will fall in love with each of these three-dimensional people.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|The detailed reviews here helped me decide to pick this up. I just wanted to add a review based on pure emotion. I had expected something as difficult and challenging as say Miles Davis' Dark Magus. Without a Net, while complex is not that. It is, to my ear, sublime. I've loved Wayne Shorter since I was a kid and this is right up there with his best work. I've been listening to it over and over and just can't stop smiling. Without a Net proves to me that jazz, like Wayne Shorter, is very much alive. This is without a doubt, the best new release that I've heard this year.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Too much dialogue great graphics and just the right amount of difficulty·Color was also pretty cool and the intensity of the subject matter kept my interest.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great love isn't found easily sometimes you have to get away from what's holding you down to get away and find it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and will see it often.  I never or seldom buy a movie that I have not already seen.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am hooked on this show, can't stop watching it. It is absolutely amazing, right up there with the ranks of American Horror Story!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This movie is one that I have seen on TV and wanted it for my collection. I think that older people would like this movie more than younger  people.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|i've other versions of Persuation editions and this is by far my favorite casting. i never loose touch with these characters.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I really love this movie.  It is one that I will watch over and over.  I hope that anybody who loves kids and music would buy this movie.
0800141660|5.0|i've seen several sense & sensibility editions and this is by far my favorite casting. i never loose touch with these old characters of jane austin's. thanks!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|There has been only two movies that Ms. Bulllock has appeared in that I hated.  She died in one movie which I hated.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|great humor and historical references this movie is an underdog redemption tale. with frances o'connor who is charming and demure. she is just the top of a list of character actors you will enjoy. thanks!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is super scary in an understated way.  It just does not jump out at you, bul, you feel it creep into your bones.  I will probably never read it again.  I am glad I read it.
B00005JM02|5.0|be careful showing this movie to really small children as the first scene when nemo's mother is killed is VERY scary to them. otherwise you will enjoy this movie for years to come. it is a delight.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Great - Excellent casting and smart stories re-imagined from the original.  I can't stop watching.  This is a must watch.
B008ER9QKG|3.0|Having only seen the simulcasts (some twice) and Walkure live, this is a review about the opera and the video content not the actual DVD set.<br /><br />I've experienced a lot of Rings, one could even call me a ring fanatic. I own 4 complete cycles on DVD, and 2 other audio recordings as well as other media exposure including a few Wagner bios, many of his writings, etc. And all comparison and academic-izing (which I love so dearly) aside - I loved this Ring. Face value this Ring was fun, pure and simple. Putting the academic-izing and comparisons back into the equation this Ring is good, it hits all the important nails well enough, and gives some wonderful acting and pretty good singing, but it's not by any means the best. That being said I believe that Wagner's Ring is a work we are blessed enough to have the ability to view over and over again in many different ways and each time pull something new out of. And in that light this is, hands down the best introduction to the Ring cycle out there. The characters are laid out simply, motives are clear, the action follows well from scene to scene, there's not much set to get wrapped up in and for the most part its sung pretty well. After experiencing this ring I believe viewers will be much better prepared to get into other Rings as well which show more complex character development/intriguing story telling and really awesome musicianship. Not that viewers are dumb, it's just that the ring is big, and very very complex, this show cleared a few things up for me as I watched it.<br /><br />I'm going to be a bit brisk with the singing because I do not think it is hugely remarkable. If you are looking for a recording of amazing singing you have to look back 30-40 (or more years), with rare exceptions (not numerable enough to fill out a cast) we just don't make Wagnarian singers any more. Acting wise though I felt that many of people were in some cases better suited to the rolls than those of the previous generation and give some very transparent and exciting acting performances.  Musically the singers are world class (though that phrase doesn't carry the weight it used to) no doubt, though many of them do feel ill suited in places to the rolls. Deborah Voigt gives a stirring acting Brunhilde though her voice is a bit past it's prime she plays it well. Bryn Terfel has a light voice, I've often felt too light for Wagner, and it's true here as well. Often in the theater I could not even hear him, however that is not a problem on the DVDs, and the lighter voice he takes to Wotan gives him a remarkable edge that you have to go back 60-70 years to hear again and that I found very exciting. Jay Hunter Morris was an excellent Siegfried and I would make similar comments about him as I did of Bryn. Stephanie Blyth is absolutely incredible - rousing and remarkable, as well as Hans Peter Konig and Eric Owens. One of my favorite characters in the Ring is Hagen and HPK really does him justice.<br /><br />The set took a lot of flack when it came out, people said it was stupid and complained bitterly about the noise it made, a problem in the theater though not on the DVDs. Personally I found it underwhelming, though not particularly gripe worthy. The set has some absolutely amazing visual moments but time wise 95% of it it sits there as a very expensive and dull backdrop. The direction is simple, in some cases overly simple, but as I stated before, that's in some ways what I liked about this production - it gives a very easy introduction to what is a very very complicated story - as any story which takes 15 hours to tell must inherently be. I do take offense at the gaul that LePage and Gelb had standing by this production claiming it to be a huge bold step forward and simply discounting dissenters as ignorant to art apparently def to the actual complaints people had. To set my pen to this informal record book: there is nothing new here save for the mechanics of the set itself, the minimalist sets were done every year from as far back as the 1920s until the late 50s, the postmodern things has been done before and the characters are just too simple to be regarded as ground breaking in any way, they just don't embody enough of anything to push any boundaries.<br /><br />Of true note, and this I must say, is the absolutely amazing conducting by James Levine. He has been conducting Wagner for many (40?) years now and he has one of the most well honed and oiled orchestras at his finger tips and he the sounds the produce are nothing short of miraculous. This recording is a starker and more stripped down musically and flourish wise than his previous recordings (thinking of the 90s DVD) and it's amazing, it shows the master at his peak, when he has looked back on a lifetime of art has taken out everything superfluous from his previous art and distilled it down to everything essential and done that perfectly. I was absolutely transfixed both in the theater and at the simulcasts at his miraculous creation. The Japanese call the aura around such things \\"sabi\\" and this has it in spades. Aguste Rodin commented similarly of the end of life work of Rembrant and he himself echoed such ideals in his final masterpiece: the portrait of Balzac.<br /><br />So maybe this deserves 4 stars, maybe I'm being too hard on this production. I'll stick with three simply because in the grand scheme of things I find this production average, and I hope the viewer goes out and watches more - finds one that deserves 5 stars (I know which one that is for me, but it's different for everyone), but stop here first. I know it's an expensive DVD set, and they all are, but you have a lifetime to enjoy the Ring and in the end 100$ a year isn't very much. Enjoy this one for a while and after you've sat with it for a while find a new one. And if you're only going to watch one ring, and you're not a particularly experienced opera goer, this is the one for you.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is one that once you start watching, you cannot stop. Not only are you automatically drawn in by the main character, Charlie, but you can't help but compare yourself him and make yourself connect. It makes you think about yourself and your own life experiences. Not only has Charlie been through a lot, but he suffers from it every day. The movie makes you want to smile, laugh, cry, and everything in between. I don't believe I have ever seen a movie like this one before now and it definitely will not be the last time.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|This movie is a must see for teens and parents alike.  It may seem like another teen romantic comedy/drama but it is a gentle reminder of the pressures that we place on our children when they are developing impressions of themselves.  Well done coming from the mother of a teen under pressure!
B000BT97AO|5.0|I admit, I am biased as I am a fan of both Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean.  That being said, I believe its greater merits are its thought provoking symbolisms, the beautiful graphic quality of the visual design of the movie and its simple and elegant narrative.  Its a beautiful movie that never fails to get my creative juices flowing whenever I watch it.  Enjoy!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love Lep's World 2 a lot!!! I just downloaded it at 12:58 and I'm already on the third stage. If you love adventure games with fun graphics and music, this game is for you.

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game reminds me so much of super Mario bros. It's so addicting and fun!! I hope there's tons of levels
B005J2UM9S|4.0|I really liked this movie until the last 5 minutes. The scares were a *little* expected - it had a very Blair Witch-y feel to it (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) - but overall it was really entertaining. It was really kinda creepy, and I actually found myself rooting for the characters, which I normally don't do in horror movies. I thought the performances were well done, especially that of Sean Rogerson.  ***SPOILER ALERT*** I just hate the old satanic cult trope. It's SO done to death; I really wish horror movie makers would just stop using it. This movie would have been so much better without it. The whole thing was like a really well executed balance beam routine, but they didn't stick the landing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excellent graphics and great control with the birds make Angry Birds both challenging and fun. I promise you will lose track of time.
0547884591|4.0|This is a solid book. It includes tips to take a beginner cook into the starting realms of professionalism in a skill-driven level of brevity (about 4 hour learning lessons). However, it contains training skills to keep you occupied for many additional hours. Overall this book includes general tasting skills, general cooking skills, and assorted recipes to train specific skill sets for making health-conscious semi-professional meals at home.<br /><br />The material is provided in a great balance between cooking healthy and providing restaurant level taste. Starting with the coconut cauliflower mash provides for a great base of health conscious substitution ideas- i.e. reduction of carbohydrates such as rice for cauliflower. While appreciating the health skills needed for home dietary needs, this book lacks a bit of the usual salt you might expect from many other cooking books. The recipes included will not have the same restaurant taste as might be expected by some recipe collectors. This is due to focusing on a balanced overall diet. For clarity, this is not the book for you if you are seeking a restaurant level taste from places Paula Deen would endorse or if you expect your food to be dipped into the Dead Sea before eating it.<br /><br />Also (potentially from the side of being overly-critical and reducing this overall rating to a 4 star rating), this book might not offer enough all around recipe ideas for a fully balanced professional chef. The book does not include or provide much information about cooking seafood. Professional chefs can really separate themselves from the common kitchen cook with their skilled preparation of seafood. This element seems to not be included or purposefully excluded from the book (potentially due to complexities in preparing different types of seafood or maybe due to access to fresh ingredients) However, some limited examples would have been a good choice to include. Encouraging and training the proper preparation of seafood and fish would have continued to support the healthy Ferriss balanced diet presentation to professional chef training. Hopefully he can continue this specific idea into an additional recipe addendum or additional series for the 4-hour book.  In the end the 5th hour material of seafood preparation would have earned this one a fifth star.<br /><br />There are certainly many good ideas and skills contained that will start an average kitchen aspirant to learn a level of skills possessed by a neophyte restaurant chef. This book is a great way to right away get chef beginner skills started at home. This book is recommended for those who want to learn these skills within a diet and health focused framework strategy.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was truly an awesome book! You really feel like Adam is a buddy of yours as you go through his life with him. This book will change the way you view your life and relationships by showing you the true secret of life : Live it to the fullest, own it, and leave everything on the table. Like the author, I was praying for it to end differently, but Adam's sacrifice was the final brush stroke of the masterpiece that is his life. Rest easy, brother.
B0093LINVK|1.0|I thought I will never say this, Mac is a bargain compared to DIY PC.<br />By the time you add missing parts and Operating System, the price exceeds that of a mac Mini which has i5 processor,  Thunderbolt, Firewire 800, four USB 3.0 ports and stylish aluminum case. Stay away from this overpriced plastic junk.
B006TTC57C|5.0|A delightful animated family film.  I am looking forward to a sequel. It has excellent animation and an endearing story.
B005OUHOLY|5.0|The greatest obstacle that prevents us from both learning effectively and from the enjoyment of performing is all the self-talk that distracts from the moment.  The message is simple, but applying it isn't easy. The tools to accomplish this are discussed in detail.  This is the foundation for all of the other great resources Kenny Werner has to offer to support us in getting the most out of our musical journeys.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|I saw the show Off-Broadway in '85 and was appauled that they changed the ending to the '87 film.  Turns out test audiences HATED the end so they had to re-do it.  Fortunately, they kept the footage in their vault!  If you don't know the stage show, it ends... ummm... darkly.  AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER TO SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.
B0063IH60K|5.0|No surprises here. You'll get a typical solitaire game. Haven't had any problems. You can change your options- background, deck, etc.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am a list maker and new to Kindle Fire but this is one of the apps that I go to almost daily. I am slowly converting my list of phone numbers and listing in separate lists according to the group of people that I associate them with.<br /><br />I have lists for each store that I shop for groceries; I prefer certain items from certain stores.  Great way to check my household/personal needs before going to a particular store. This easy to find list is really helpful.<br /><br />I have a list of all my preferred music stations on Comcast.  I have a wine list of wines that we enjoyed and want to buy again.<br />I have a list of books I want to read.<br /><br />Great place to keep a running grocery list of what you are running out of.
0316044695|5.0|the book was brand new and what I had expected it to be  it is a very good book to read
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The movie was to slow didnt have much plot.  showed the hole he was wallowing but very little how he got there. He was not likeable in the beginning. Should have shown the high to the low then his freedom. His likeability at the end was not very believeable.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|loved it if your board this is the game to play so much more fun than temple run so fun
B008S6B41C|5.0|Got it this morning, was interested in the Quad mix disc. Already have the DVD Audio disc. I was blown away, much better separation then my dvd-a disc. Anyone that gives this box set anything below a 4 star is probably listening to it on a boom box. You need a good quality surround system to really get the most from these disc's. Any Audiophile will be happy. I have Yamaha components, 7.2 receiver, DVD-A ,SACD player, Polk Audio speakers and dual Yamaha subs. Bye for now time to rock out
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Its a good light. I have 2 of them and keep one in my truck. best thing about it is it runs on aa batteries. Very bright.
B00BESIKWM|4.0|The girl playing Heather looked just like the game. The writer for these movies and games must use some heavy acid. FREAKY creatures depicted realistically. Ending made it clear there'd be a sequel.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|If I could give this movie NO stars I would.  It was just a horrible movie.  Did not make sense.  No action.  0 stars
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Science fiction/adventure/fantasy at its best. Hugh managed to create characters that are easy to identify with and care about, all staged in a post-apocalyptic world where the population have moved into silos to avoid a poisoned planet, or this is what we believe. The heroine goes from working in mechanical, the very bowels of the silo, more than 100 levels below ground, to being raised to sheriff, the very top of the food chain, and then betrayed. She is left with one option, to go through the cleansing. No one ever returns from this. She goes to her doom .... the story continues. Well worth a read. An inventive and riveting read. Truly enjoyed it and look forward to additions to the story in the future. Hugh, you've written a winner.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I actually liked this movie.  It was okay but not a 3 to me.  WAY better than the original.  Was better than the reviews I received.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved it so much. There is action going on every second. I already have the next book. I would recommend this to people of all ages
B00589BMF0|5.0|of  course  this  is the ultimate movie  -  the only reason I rented it was because I could not find my DVD
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|This was agift for our Son who wanted a good recording of Beethovens piano Sonatas. He told us he was very pleased.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I thought this was an entertaining movie.  I love Sylvester.  The other stars during that era were good too.  3 stars
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My brother and his wife shared Season 1 with my husband and I, when we were visiting them.  We were hooked!  Have enjoyed Season 2 very much and are enjoying Season 3 as it airs on PBS. What is fascinating about Downton Abbey is the interaction of the servants with the &#34;upper class,&#34; and their challenges and opinions of both regarding the same events.  Although the people are characters from the past, the problems they address are timeless and hence fascinating.  In spite of the fact that we got ahead in the story by watching Season 3 as it airs, Season 2 clarified the events in Season 3 and is enjoyable to watch even out of sequence!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|this was a GREAT movie.  I was entertained throughout.  everything correlated with the other movies.  I watched it several times within the period that I rented it.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Why pay hundreds for a Monster cable when you can get the exact same fidelity in this cable?  I have bought quite a few of these because they're cheap and extremely functional.<br /><br />Again, why spend hundreds when you can spend a few bucks on this?  In the end, it's a digital signal anyhow...
B007H7XJD4|3.0|I thought this was a good movie  -  Very entertaining.  Henry (from Tudors?) was good and so was Mickey Rourke.  Mickey was supposed to be good.  3 stars
B007B6VOG0|5.0|The first time I saw this group, they were featured on Saturday Night Live -- and I was hooked. Then they showed up and kicked *** on the Grammys. I just love their energy, enthusiasm AND talent. Excellent.
B0088WGBC8|5.0|THIS was an outstanding movie.  It had everything:  comedy, action, thrills, and it moved me.  5 stars for denzel in directing and acting and the other star  -  names escapes me right now.
B0049VZ222|5.0|A friend turned me onto the show I was a little hesitant to pay for it but once I did it was definately worth it. Great show.
B00005JNS0|5.0|A very &#34;G&#34; rated movie, super fast cars, great story line and a happy ending. Seriously, I love this movie. Wait, I mean, my three year old loves this movie.... =)
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Well worth every penny. I purchased this season after buying season 1. I was hooked and couldnt stop watching and am now just waiting for the new episodes.
0887081770|4.0|The size, listed in the product description area, is definitely worth noting!! I bought it for my preschooler since our larger version of this book finally bit the dust but it wasn't as good, in my opinion, as the traditional book. Certain pages unfold and they can be tricky to get back into their proper place. I wish we had just gone with a normal copy!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show I had to buy all three seasons so I can catch up and be current. I would recommend to anyone.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My kiddo doesn't get to play with this as much as he'd like but, when is able to convince me to place my Kindle in his precarious hands, he goes straight to this app. It is VERY easy to figure out and has a ton of different abilities. We'd buy it again in a heartbeat!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really great game. I love how u make money while the game is off. Definitely a good one to check out if u like time management games!
B00932AA5G|5.0|wow, this had been sitting in my watchlist for months.  Probably due to subtitles.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Great film...  bet we will be seeing an english remak in the near future
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Really recommend this book to kids that are between the ages of eight and early teens because it is a funny book I've read but it felt like he was trying take it longer and stalling if i<br />wasn't for that it would be five
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book pulled me in immediately and it spoke to my weakest points.  \\"Don't look back, you aren't going that way\\"  Life is too short to take today for granted. Lovely story
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was the best carnival game ever lot's of hidden games or items. the story mystery was a good story and so sad at the end i can't wait for the sequel
1616960922|5.0|Excellent book. Brandon Sanderson is my favorite author. His mistborn series is amazing<br />Ellantris-which this book follows- is so good, you want to call the author and beg for the continuation.
B001N3GUIE|4.0|1956G: All the elements of a great scifi flick - unexplained beaming weapons with cool colors (tech), no real look at the monster (suspense), hot chick (scantly clad), decent plot (find hot chick on a distant planet 100M miles from Earth that only took a year to reach - ~11.5Kmph), and good sound effects (unknown space sounds). Loved it. MFJLabs 4x
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run two is so cool I could play it all day awesome<br />game I think that everyone should play it.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|If you like history and detective stories, then this is the book for you. I heard the author, Paul French on the Diane Rheem show, and immediately bought the book. I like the way French tells the story and I like his historical scholarship. I also had to find who done it, which he would not reveal on the radio show.<br /><br />I really am impressed with the character of the father of the murdered girl. He was not a nice man, he was not well liked, but man was he tough, in an unconventional way.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|All in all it's pretty fun as far as games of this type go. Enjoyable enough for all ages regardless of playing style or preference.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book by a true American bandanas I recommend it to any and all<br />A definite must read for anyone
B00AF6B22E|1.0|As a pilot, I find the way the main character is depicted in this movie simply offensive!<br /><br />This story is complete fiction, and has nothing to do with reality!<br /><br />An even slightly intoxicated pilot would not be able to fly or function in the cockpit,<br />no matter if that's a small or a big airplane, and it would not be possible to hide an<br />intoxication or an addiction to alcohol or other substances from other flight personal.<br /><br />I like Denzel Washington as an actor, and I am surprised that he accepted to play<br />in such a badly researched movie.<br /><br />It was painful for me to watch this movie, because it depicts the opposite of how pilots in real life would act -- e.g. act responsibly.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|So I'm a 16 year old who had to pick a book for my book report for school. I chose this book because it was free on my kindle and it sounded pretty interesting. I hate books like no joke haha but this is the first book I actually liked. I read this book in 3 days! My eyes burn like a mother but it was worth it. Anyways, read this book!
B008MG1E4A|2.0|After all the hype and drama surrounding this book, I thought it would be very good read.  Everyone seemed to rate it very highly.  However, it was a letdown to me.  I couldn't get past all the descriptions of weapons, military maneuvers, and tactical thinking.  It was way beyond my scope.  I have concluded it must be a MAN'S book.  After reading about all of his accomplishments, his training, and different missions - it seemed such a waste to spend only one chapter on the actual death of bin Laden.  I realize it was intended to be simply a factual book and tried to keep that in mind as I dozed off repeatedly trying to read it.  I was unhappy with the book.
B00631VJIC|5.0|This CD is the best.  If you're an SOA fan you probably already own it.  I would recommend this to anyone.

B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I thought it relied too much on the emphasis of extremely crude humor to be funny. Sorry story line, really bland, dragged on, thought it would be funnier than it was. Followed the structure of Family Guy too close. Could have been better.

B00B4Z5J92|4.0|I laughed, I cried, I threw all of my digital equipment out the window! Seriously, this is a very well done documentary if you are a fan of Nirvana, Dave Grohl, Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac, or any other of the many bands that recorded albums at Sound City. There is also a lot of reminiscing about &#34;the good ole' days&#34; when you needed a lot of patience and a lot of money to record an album in a studio like Sound City. It is said in the film that Pro Tools killed Sound City and that is a shame but there is also a more anti-digital theme in the film that I while don't think that digital music tools should replace everything dear and analog, I also don't believe that digital is the devil. Digital has enabled a lot of bedroom producers, after-hours musicians, and engineers to make decent sounding demos and even full albums at their own pace and in their own place. Apartment dwellers can have a hard time acoustically treating anything so the digital realm has been a godsend by democratizing music making.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A very moving story of the human condition, a feast for the eyes, AND a great soundtrack.<br />Highly recommended! See this pic!
B005Z271Y6|5.0|The mood her voice sets can only be described as heartfelt and captivating.  This live performance allows her voice to shine even brighter than on her studio recordings.  If you like the studio versions, you'll love the live stuff.  The band is subtle and tight as well.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i love this game my mom has this game on her phone i play it all the time 2 thumbs up lol
B000PMLFRA|5.0|my daughter was thrilled to get this.  couldn't seem to find before.  just what she had hoped for for the holidays.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved every minute of it.  Watched it on my Kindle Fire HD.  Excellent picture and sound quality.  I was amazed!
B0015DROBO|5.0|It took me a while to &#34;get into&#34; the book, and is not the typical genre I read, but it really drew me in-couldn't put it down.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is a great product, came in just fine packaged right and safe. You are safe to order this product.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved both seasons of American horror story. Great actors in this season. . Can't wait til next season 3. It left me on the egde of my seat for the whole because you never knew what was coming next.
0425252868|5.0|I bought this book for my husband. I usually read time travel, romance, and apocalyptic books. I read the cover and it sounded interesting. I've always loved non-fiction-especially history concentrating on time travel during the Civil War. After all, this is a New York Times Best Seller, so I decided to give it a try, thinking I would read the first chapter then fall asleep. With 371 pages also filled with many, many pictures (never printed before), I was captured with the plot immediately.  No way could I stop reading this book. It intertwines the lives of enemies- Germans and the Americans-especially two men. It took the author eight years of research to write this book. His impeccable details proves his acclaimed research. It does not glorify war, in fact, almost the opposite. It shows how the fighter pilots REALLY felt. The vivid details, love, heartbreak, families torn apart, some killed, but most of all it gives a very clear picture of World War 11. I thought my history was pretty good-little did I realize, I knew nothing! I thought everyone knew what Hitler was doing with the concentration camps! It tells of how hearts change in war, sometimes for the worst, but also sometimes for the best. I cannot say enough about this book to give it the justice and proclamation it deserves. I've always wanted to visit camps in Germany, with many other major landmarks. I envy the author of his knowledge. This book just heightened my personal desires. Maybe someday I will be able to visit the places in Gemany- with this book forever burned into my mind. Highly recommended to everyone.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Thease are great for work. They are comfortable but I wish the cord were longer. It seems to be a common length but an extra foot or 2 would be nice.
B003VANOFY|5.0|this is an awesome headset. The sound quality is amazing and you can wear this for hours on end without any discomfort. Easy setup and great battery life
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|I tried to create several books and could not get them to store the data<br />I stopped when I got frustrated, but will try again, especially if I can get some help.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Since 2 Pac died, there hasn't really been any rap/hip hop music with substance. For the past decade, hip-hop has just been about booty calls and nice cars. Macklemore brings meaning back to rap
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wanted to learn how to play this.  I have young grandchildren I think will enjoy it.  I would like to know how you &#34;earn&#34; gems.  I'd like to buy my horse a &#34;buddy&#34;.....The graphics are good and not to difficult to operate.<br /><br />Opportunities to learn how you would care for a horse are great!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I only got half way through this book so I don't know how it ended.  I would have preferred a &#34;story&#34; as to a Q&A History.  What I did read was more on the political side of a zombie war than the zombies themselves.  I'm a zombie lover but this was just not my style of book!
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is such an usual read, just like the first book and I am enjoying it immensely.  Will read more of Lee Child's books, for sure.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very well written and enjoyable story. The author's description of antebellum life seems authentic and her characterizations believable.  Well done.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I thought this was going to be awesome. Instead it was awful.  What a waste of my time and money.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I ordered this for my dad as a Xmas gift. Fast shipping and arrived undamaged.  My only gripe is, the folks watched the whole season in one weekend lol.
B0011ZRU7E|5.0|Wow....it's just a nice alum to listen to. I never get tired of it ..it's  good in. the car ...good at home...even mom likes it at 86....lol........peace out
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I used to watch this show up until the 3rd season then just stopped watching....looks like I have some catching up to do lol!  This was a xmas gift for the fam and they loved it and everything worked!  Good deal
B00B2V66VS|4.0|With this sequel, Imangi Studios polished what made the original good and created a game that's a lot of fun to play. The hours will just fade away with one.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought this movie was weak along with the books. My gf however thinks different since she paid to watch it treating on my account.
B007C94XG4|5.0|I bought this for my 7 year old son for his  Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD and he simply LOVES IT !!!<br />The clarity and sound are absolutely awesome.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Greatest show eveeeeeeeeeeer! Season 2 was meh and damn them for straying from the books while s1 was darn near spot on. Anyways I know I'll be buying season 2 anyways when it comes out. Can't wait for season 3
B00A1AF4DM|3.0|This book begins with nano robots and suddenly we are focussed on little people adventures.  Very dangerous and deadly adventures forced upon them by the villain of the story.  The robots do come back into the picture at a later time.  If you are grossed out easily this is probably not for you - at least if preparing bug dinner, being bug dinner gross you out.  It was a good story - not great.  The little people dropped like flies as they travelled until only two were left.  I did not expect them to start getting done in so soon.  My biggest complaint is the ending was not really satisfying to me and I don't think it was really satisfying to any of the characters.  That's the main reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 4.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this product but if there tons have a Rio theme they should change it more often. Like the stuff is always thesame it should change more often.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|What a great book!  I would now love to see the movie.  I wish to know the outcome of Pay & his father's relationship.
0374533571|5.0|Silver Linings is a wonder as a first novel.  It is a great story and a great read.  It makes you cry and makes you laugh.  Compared to the book the movie is heavy and changes things that did not need to be changed.  A major example, and I don't believe what I am about to relate will adversely impact either reader or movie goer, is this: In the movie they turned the dance contest into a a contest of professional ballroom dancers with Pat and Tiffany doing several different dance steps to several different musical numbers.  In the book, the contest is put on by Tiffany's therapy group and is called, \\"Dancing for Depression\\", a title, that Hollywood probably felt was politically incorrect but that added to the comedic quality of the book.  It is a contest among group members and supporters not professional dancers. In the book Tiffany and Pat do a modern dance number to the music of Bonnie Tyler's, Total Eclipse of The Heart. The song and the lyrics fit both characters perfectly- why Hollywood changed this scene is beyond my comprehension. There are other unneeded changes that are just as egregious but I will yield to the temptation of disclosing them.  In short, it is a wonderful book and the movie will be a major disappointment for most readers of the book.<br />There is nothing wrong with the movie as a stand alone vehicle. All the performances are either good or excellent. It has been classified as comedy and that it is not nor does it, in my view, compare favorably to the book.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I ordered this for my husband. He missed the first season when it first came out and was excited to be able to watch it with no commercials
B005LAII80|1.0|I pre oredered this blu-ray because I was eager to watch it. The blu-ray disc did not work in my player ( I have not tried others) so I had to watch the movie on my computer using the digital code.
0345529057|5.0|This is, without question, my absolute favorite fantasy series to date. The setting is incredibly deep and rich, with a sense of mountains of history always hovering in the background. The PoV characters are all very well-realized and fleshed out with individual personalities and believable motivations - I'd even go so far as to say a fair few of the supporting characters have more depth to them than primary characters in other series (Wheel of Time, I'm looking at you).<br /><br />FEAST is a bit slower than the preceding books, mostly setting things up to happen later on, but if you can power through it DANCE (the fifth novel in the series, not included in this set) is much more enjoyable, IMO. The first three books are almost more alternate history than fantasy, and while the two after that do include a fair bit more magic and mystery they never lose the series' foundation of political intrigue and intrapersonal conflict. An excellent series to recommend to someone who doesn't generally like fantasy, IMO.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|The love of Karate flicks gets my adrenalin going and being a part of the martial arts world I loved it even more. Lucy Liu you go on girl!!!!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Excellent show, and about damn time we see a well-done medieval period piece on TV again. The fact it's set in my favorite fantasy series to date is just gravy.
0060557818|3.0|This was an odd little book. Richard Mayhew is cast into a secret fantastical world beneath London after he stops to help an injured girl on the street. He encounters rat-speakers, a fierce bodyguard, and numerous other strange beings in his pursuit of the girl named Door. Trying to reclaim his former life, he is caught up in Door's quest and the mystery surrounding the death of her family as they flee enemies with an ever-changing agenda. I enjoyed this book, but I felt like I never quite knew what was going on. It lacked tension until the end but was otherwise enjoyable to read.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|The sad story of how a Belgium King conquered the Congo using Africans as slaves.  King Leopold carried out a reign of terror against the people of that land, many of them peaceful.  He hid his brutality from Europeans as he stripped the country first of its rubber and then it's other mineral wealth. He used his wealth primarily to enrich himself and did little for the Belgian citizens.  His barbarity was ultimately discovered. The only value if there was any, was that the dense impenetrable jungle was opened to the world.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Very happy with this item. Works perfectly! Bought a 2nd one for my mom!  Takes your talk time from 7 hours to 21 hours.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even more amazing than the first book. Couldn't put it down with constant thrill at each turn of the page.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott's story is very inspiring and really shows the power of the mind in what is no doubt an extreme sport. Though I no longer am attempting to be a vegan I do try to incorporate as much quality plant food in my diet as possible and Scott shares his tried and true recipes which is a whole separate gold mine. For someone who performs at the level he does to share not only how they eat but his own personal recipes is more than generous.<br /><br />I was really impressed by Scott's genuine sense of decency and simply his humanity. This is no cocky athlete although he has certainly earned the rite to be. I found his mental outlook to be so surprising and inspiring that I think it's a good read for anyone. Our culture worships the often over confident athlete but there is as much or more power in a more humble approach as Scott personifies.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I'm a hair stylist, and appointments are everything. This really works for me. I downloaded this app on a friends nexus 7 and she love's it. On more appointment book for us. Thanks
B001O9BB3G|5.0|I know this is a review for the book, which I absolutely loved.  I just wished they could have added more details from the book to the movie.  I would suggest reading the book first because there is a lot more detail.  The book sucks you in and the author Shamam Sarif did an excellent job at writing this story that takes place in South Africa in the 1950's and the issues people hand to contend with, such as segregation and the treatment of women.  I love the book and I absolutely love the movie!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Beautifully-interwoven story about human experience.  Writer/director finds humor and hope amid tragedy, simplicity amid chaos and sheds light on another culture without trivializing or romanticizing it.  I loved the pace of this film, no jarring cuts or inconclusive character development.  And if none of this strikes a chord with you, the stellar actor list alone should make you want to check it out!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome show. Five star. Love it. Highly recommend Downton Abbey.Need to watch season one and season two. You will be hooked.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is by far the best strategy game that I have ever played on my kindle.  and its free. well worth your time and effort.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|This show will BLAST you in the ass...  It will CRUNCH you in the butt!  The show is THAT good!!!  Watch just a few episodes... Just a few, and I promise you your ass will feel like it was blasted hardcore.  Watch the whole season, and you may not be able to sit down for a week!  The show is THAT good!!
B00846F1YW|4.0|The game is pretty fun--kinda like an ISpy for adults. The only issue I really had was that it's more repetitive than it is challenging. I think for the next game it would help to add some variety to the puzzles. Also, it's jabs at dyslexic were a real LOL.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Seem to play this one when I want to relax and take 10. It can be challenging to better oneself for time.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A great insight to the making of many favorite albums.  A must see for musicians and music lovers.  This movie shows the true artistry of so many great albums.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Don't know what I expected, but didn't quite expect what it is. Must be fore little kids. Pass if you are a grown-up.
B000VPPMXO|5.0|The lighthouse is a great idea. Unfortunately it does not work for my Roomba 564. The owner's manual explains that it is compatible for models 570 and higher. Sooo back to the seller it goes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|yay. it was good and fun. all types of games to enjoy. have fun with it. old school. good good
1608871517|5.0|I just love this book, and I can tell that Mr. Bush loved working with Michael. There was a great respect for each other.Michael drove Mr. Bush crazy with his little riddles about how he wanted some of his clothes created. I have many books on MJ and this is one of my favorites. He was even asked to prepare Mj for his funeral. God Bless You Mr. Bush!! Thank You for caring for such a beautiful person. RIP MJ.
B008602KQI|5.0|Amazing DVD for cheap! Also comes with ultraviolet copy and has a digital copy to take where ever! And there's also an amazing surprise that comes with your purchase!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another excellent Harry Bosch novel. If you're a fan of this series by Connelly, you'll recognize the usual setup and conclusion and won't be disappointed.
B001V7UXG2|3.0|Bought this one due to the rave reviews here on Amazon.<br /><br />Over all its very good but somewhat VERY DRY humor. If you like English comedies (\\"like keeping up appearances\\" or \\"Are you being served\\") you may like this just be forewarned that this is a slow paced affair (far slower then the two shows I mentioned even). Also be aware that this show demands a LOT of your attention, no doing something else why it is running or you will miss half the story line.<br /><br />While I personally do enjoy the show I don't think it is quite the amazing thing the other reviewers here seem to think.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Freakin addicting that's for sure. super fun game and keeps you trying to beat your high score time and time again.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love this series. Great show and the characters are interesting. I recommend this show as it is a little different.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book was a thriller. There was something new and exciting in each chapter. Definitely a page turner! I'm obsessed!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game will make you pull your hair out and go back for more.<br />love it.<br />. . . . .
B008SVS3FC|5.0|John Hiatt gets better with age.  Give it up is what someone likely sang to him at some point in his career.  Great tunes from a great master.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel saves a lot of lives, but can he save himself? His road to self-destruction has been a long one and it looks to be coming to a head. Can he find redemption before it's too late? I won't give anything away, but this is a powerful performance by Denzel Washington and definitely worth a viewing.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|The master...what more can you say....really?  Van Morrison needs to be discovered by a new generation. So, Grandma, Grandpa..do your share.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin does an excellent job getting the reader to know Lincoln up close and personal. I couldn't put it down
B00846F1YW|5.0|The visuals are well done,  but like pretty much all of these search games, it gets repetitive. The puzzles are very easy. Playing on a KF and currently on chapter 17.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I love this tv show! My friends have been borrowing it to watch to. I will continue to purchase the seasons as they are released.
0486650677|5.0|It is a great introduction for engineering students. These topics are often teached in a shortened form and they often unclear for many students. So I have to recommend ths book for everyone who waht really  understand the problem and who need something that is close to thinking of engineers.
1419705849|5.0|All his other ones are in hard back and so we just ordered this one for that purpose. He really loves these books, they are a quick read and entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was exciting and very informative. I can't begin to wonder what it would be like for me. I don't think I could have left.
B0047VSW30|4.0|There are some scenes that are not for young audiences but I liked the movie.  It if fairly accurate however some things have been changed in an effort to be more entertaining.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I chose this rating because I really enjoyed the movie, it made me cry since I love dogs .  I like the way that things were told from the boy and dogs perspective.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I knit and love the ability to open my pdf patterns and mark them up to keep track of where I am or which parts of the pattern need special attention.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app because it allows me to listen to a cat purring while I read.  The new \\"mix sounds\\" feature is wonderful, too.  Last night, my husband and I listened to a combination of \\"purring cat\\" and \\"shower\\".  We think the \\"shower\\" sound sounds more like rain, so we imagined a purring cat snug in the window sill watching the rain outside.  It was very soothing.<br /><br />While the sound mixing is a good start, the feature I would love to have in the next update is the ability to mix sounds so that certain sounds play for certain time intervals.  For example, perhaps the mix would start as purring cat/shower.  After ten minutes, the shower would fade out, and the forest sound would fade in.  After two minutes, the car sound would fade in and out over a period of 20 seconds.  After another 15 minutes, the forest would fade out, and the shower would fade back in...<br /><br />Essentially, the feature I describe would give the user the ability to create \\"songs\\" by having the different sounds fade in and out and mix for differing lengths of time.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Just 4 of 5 stars because you need to add the  wireless amazon page to the app, everything else is fine
030746363X|5.0|Very entertaining and informative.  I tried the slow carb diet detailed in the book and lost 20 pounds of fat in a month.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Mockingjay<br /><br />Nothing new...  repeat of the other books..  bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla ,bla, bla, bla
B005JABSB6|4.0|Work really well with a nice auto off feature if left on by mistake. Only small annoyance was when you looked away from the TV they would shut off and than turn back on when you looked back at the screen. Had no issues with headaches etc with these and they feel comfortable when wearing and are lightweight. Had to charge initially when I got them but only took an hour or so,.<br /><br />The picture was a much better 3D experience than expected.<br /><br />Not a fan of the 65 price but in line with other models. Would highly recommend.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|The plot has so many twists and turns that sometimes it's hard to remember or even figure out who the good guys and bad guys are.<br /><br />However, there were several times during the first season where I found myself saying \\"wow, I didnt see that coming.\\" So, I'm watching season 2
B0001MIQHQ|3.0|First off,I have to admit that I absolutely adore this movie. Classic 80's Sci-Fi, it's off the chart with it's medicore side bit actors and all. A must have for the classic rainy day movie collection. I give the movie itself 5 stars.<br /><br />As fort the rest...I ordered this movie from Movie Mars and have been very happy with the customer service. At first I was dismayed because it took about 1.5 weeks for the order to even be shipped, but after it was sent out the movie was at my house within few days. Then I realized that I had ordered the 'wrong region'. Apparently there is some small print on the ordering sheet about buying a PAL or NTCS version that I must have skipped. However once I contacted Movie Mars. the customer service was amazing. They offered quick response times and friendly clear return instructions, as well as a refund. Very happy with this company's customer service, just wish the ordering was a little more clear.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Really good app, I personally wish it updated the  weather more often. But it is fairly accurate, or as accurate as the weather can get. I enjoy it's user friendly format and am sure you will too! I recommend it to anyone who likes to plan ahead for the weather.
B004RUF022|5.0|Marie-Claire is one of the greatest living artists on the pipe organ today. This collection of all of Bach's organ works is, I believe, her third time to record Bach since the 1960s. Every recording is well-done, and to anyone who is a fan of the pipe organ, the Baroque period, or Bach in general, this is a very reasonably priced collection that is essential to one's collection.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I absolutely loved this book.  This book stirs up a storm of emotions for the reader that you become and understand Pat Peoples.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I just love all the nevosoft hidden object games. They're basically all the same just different story lines that keep you going. I did get very frustrated with the dragon picture. Took me several tries and had to put it down and walk away. But I made it through the whole game!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|We really loved this movie, really well done a great one for music lovers. Great footage and interviews. Check it out!
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I can see why this won the Grammy. Quality from top to bottom. Worth the 2.99 I paid for it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Author is at her best when painting the inner life of her subjects, and in particular how trying to be the cool girl is a path to submission to your own marital abuse.  Also quite intriguing in portraying the results of parents making a living by exploiting their child.  Gets overheated as the plot progresses to the point of scaring the reader away from characters they want to like.
1594744769|5.0|This book was really cool.It was a fun and quick read.The pictures added a really nice aspect to it and I  enjoyed the experience.
B007THA4FI|1.0|What universal contempt this book holds for all of its characters portrayed in various shades of dumb, pathetic, meek, self-destructive, pretentious, selfish, dishonest, depraved, loathed and loathing.  I'm simply baffled with by the heartless misanthropy that animates this author's attempt a portrait of provincial life when that same author delighted so many young readers in fantasy.  The adults in this novel are shallow Muggles at best, when they are not depraved monsters, and the children, damaged and doomed.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I love her characters and her development of them.  Also, I think when an author has a realistic ending of a story it is very satisfying to the reader.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I like the idea of having an extra charging cable for my Kindle.  I keep this one at the office.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and easy, u need to use real money in order to speed things up but other than that is cool.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game but buggy and gets annoying with the pop up ads for other games. Also wish that some of the tasks didn't take so long to complete.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I am trying to get the 3-stars on each level but just can't get there. Glad i got one of those pen-like tools to use with the kindle. My fingers are too big to aim!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daugther love this app plus she learn how to take care of a horse, it is like to have a ral horse to care of
B00A757EFW|1.0|Maybe if the kindle had the joy stick i used to use when playing on the machines it would be more fun. Already removed
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is asome i loved it it's fun and cool. I Love love love love love love love love
B0063IH60K|2.0|Didn't know ads were on this app. no wonder it was free! To get no ads, it costs 2.99. I think this should be posted so you know before you download
B003YFIUW8|5.0|the story kept me wanting more...wanting to find out what would happen to them.  Would they escape? would things ever be normal for them?
0790731002|4.0|This movie was fantastic from start to finish. Two thumbs up for the third installment of the series. I highly recommend this film for the whole family.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is a fun game.  Too much dialogue. Have not played mysteryville one. I might look for it. I enjoy this type of game.
B006OEPITO|3.0|This book was required for school and in all actuality once you dive in, you'll want to continue until you finish.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Light and fun.  Not a bad little flick for a boring Thursday night.  Don't set too high of expectations and you'll be fine.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I have been playing this game for a few weeks now on my iPad Mini, and it is GREAT! It will keep you entertained for hours and hours, and will easily get frustrating after awhile. You basically have three chances to destroy all the tanks and little guys on the screen with rocks. Sometimes you'll get bonus tries and get gold rocks and other things to throw at them. There are mini games too, one where you have to survive with at least one diamond (instead of rocks) to clear it, and then another where you only get one rock to throw. There's also a little area where you can go to type stuff to King Oddball himself.<br /><br />I love the artwork, it's fun to play, and I love the quirky messages like \\"Rather Good\\" and \\"Epic Win\\" that the King ends with after you win a level. Would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone!
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Blah blah, sexy girl, blah blah, fighting robots, blah blah, cliche action lines, blah blah, talking robots, blah blah blah.
B00785P2QC|4.0|awesome game.  but just wish it gave more I vestment points. great way to kill some time through out the day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game I think everyone should get this you can buy people and you take the tour around the world!!!
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|...because I feel like I'm robbing the developer of their excellent work. A lot of the time I'm finding I don't like the FAotD, but this is definitely not one of those times.<br /><br />You must guide our interpid sleepwalking hero, Moonboy, to his bed. Doing this requires some thinking if you want to collect all the stars and moons available on each level while avoiding disaster.<br /><br />Lots of charm and polish. (I especially like how the world moves/tilts in parallax view as you tilt your device. It's small touches like that make me wish some developers would put as much soul into their apps.) There are a couple of options for those, &#34;oops!,&#34; moments. (Love how you can rewind back some to fix mistakes.) Looks great on my Motorola Xoom tablet.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I heard Steve Harvey talk about this book on his show and purchased it. I just retired from the military with three tours to Iraqi and things were not going the way that I needed them to AT ALL. After starting to read this book I had a new outlook on things. It is a very uplifting book. I read a couple of pages daily.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|The best of S/F where sience fiction has potential to become reality.<br />Recomended fo anyone thinking of human evolution or is just C Clarke fan.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Obviously one you have to be in the mood for but I was surprised how well I liked this feature. I like Seth Macfarlane's work on Family Guy but didn't know how that would come across on a movie- would it be too drawn out? Would it be tiring after a while? Not at all! Very funny ridiculous, again I believe you do have to be in the right mood like you do for most of his work so it doesn't become obnoxious but our family enjoyed it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i recommend this to all adults. as each episode ends you can't wait for the next one to begin. kudos
0449000729|5.0|This order was fulfilled by Amazon and I'm very pleased that it arrived as promised. The packaging was as expected and there were no problems with the book. Thank you!
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|He has such a unique voice for such a young man!  I see him going far, maybe like George Strait has someday.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Great game, very beautiful and worth the money. I would always recommend this game to anyone looking to bring some beauty into their lives
B004GYY714|5.0|I listen to all kinds of radio stations with this app!  I have it on my computer, my cell, my roku...endless radio listening!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wonderful story!!!! Wish it did not have to end!!! It would make a awesome movie!!! Ready to read the 2 nd book & I hear that there will be a third!!:))
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is pretty cool. Next best thing to a real horse.  I'm sure my granddaughter will love this.  I'm far from being a kid but still love it.  The only problem I see is things slow down and seem like it might freeze but it never does.
B0096PYUE2|2.0|need kindle flash player and this is no substitute. Cant use what is useless; knidle needs to work with adobe
B009E9R1IM|4.0|The thing that isn't great...just to get it out there....the sound isn't the best.  The BBC Sessions album has a better sound.  That said, I have Celebration Day on CD, Blu-ray video, and now....vinyl.  The vinyl sounds the best...this isn't one of the those, &#34;I'm telling myself that it's better&#34; to justify the cost of the vinyl version..it IS better on vinyl..the music sound more alive than the digital audio versions.  The package itself is very nice...although it's no different that what you get in the other versions of Celebration Day.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|As a fan of the the latest BBC version of Sherlock, I was at first not interested to give this show a try. After all, many times British shows remade by Americans aren't half as good as the originals. However, Elementary is the exception. Making Watson female actually works very well, as portrayed by the nicely understated Lucy Lui. I did notice though that the producers toned down Sherlock's rudeness in this version. He is a lot less ascorbic than Benedict Cumberbatch.
B000002JEV|5.0|Fantastic album.  The music is classic Led Zeppelin.  The mastering of the audio is excellent...no muffling of the dynamic range.  The instruments and vocals all come through very clearly...this sounds better then Celebration Day.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Fantastic historical fiction, extremely well researched and written.  Character development was superb and plot exceptional. Would recommend it highly. Would not recommend the made-for-tv movie based on the novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game its fun to play and I also like that u could get free coins to open new games
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|I first heard of Vintage Trouble while I was at a Who concert in Philly in December. Well, they so struck me, I seeked out this album soon after....and it has become one of my favorites. Plainly put: THIS BAND ABSOLUTELY KICKS ASS.<br /><br />Buy this album. You will not be disappointed.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Great music on this album.  I have all of Josh's music.  These songs are very upbeat and catchy.  If you like Josh Groban then get this album.
B00B52F278|5.0|Does anyone know the arrival date of the series (when it comes out on dvd...) I love this series to death but don't want to order it yet if it's going to take more than 3 months for it to come out on dvd.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Never disappointed when Men In Black is concerned. I was surprised when it came out and could not wait to watch it. Any serious Sci-Fi buff would like this movie...
0634022296|5.0|Great chord songbook that seems to have most if not all the Beatles work. Great smaller size book. Highly recommend.
044024367X|5.0|This book was very good it was hard for me to put down. The Jack Reacher Novels are like a good mystery hard to let go till it is solved.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I enjoy doing puzzles so I use this app to unwind from a stressful job.  You can make the puzzles easy or hard.  I have not used any other puzzle app so I cannot compare it with others.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This such a great series.  Which the next season was out already, can't wait.  My husband & watched this series and we both liked it very much.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game.  i liked the fact there was a hint button in case you get stuck.  creative story line &amp; cool graphics.  can't wait for #2!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Macic Puzzles is great fun.  It has a wide variety of puzzles . Everyone should be able to find something of interest.  Some reviewers have stated problems in being able to rotate pieces.  I have not had to rotate a single piece. Each puzzle piece is already in the proper rotation.  This game works properly on my Kindle Fire.  Lots of fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My husband ordered this novel for his iPad and I was out of books at the time. I usually don't read what he does but I was desparate.  This is a really bizarre novel but in a good way.  At first I didn't think it would be so exciting, and was prepared to muddle through but then the story really got me.  I won't say much more because to discuss it further might spoil the roller coaster ride.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Our family never saw this when it was out and couldn't understand all of the hysteria about the show but now we are full time addicts and are trying to ration the shows so that it lasts longer! JJ Abrahms best work.
1475143389|5.0|Finally after 40 years of bodybuilding I have found a book that makes perfect sence of it all. Bigger Leaner Stronger makes it easy to understand. Mike explaines in everyday terms what and when to eat to bulkup, maintain or cut. When and how to workout using the correct amount of reps and sets for every muscle. Just read it and your on your way to acheiving your goals as a bodybuilder. It's a great book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So much fun, couldn't put it away, stayed up all night playing it, I have a ton more of games like these on my kindle now
B004J64QR4|5.0|I love this play! It is amazing! Amazing actors! Love the singing! Been singing it since I watched it! Seriously thinking about buying the soundtrack!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I Love all of these mystery, crime thriller games, they keep me so hooked, I could play them all day, this one for sure is one of my faves!
0684857820|4.0|This was a great read, regardless of gender or personal history.  I greatly admired Ms. Sebold's courage and commitment to ensuring that the perpetrator answered for his deplorable actions.  I would have given the book five stars except for the fact that it seemed to me that after Lila's rape, the author was in a hurry to finish the book:  Ms. Sebold's subsequent story seemed chopped, as if she was not interested in sharing much more; perhaps she wasn't.  In addition, although not required for the story, I would have appreciated knowing the status of Gregory Madison:  Is he still in prison, does she fear for her safety upon his release, etc..  All in all, though, I am glad that I read the book.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Lots of Drama and very good photography!<br />However, I could tell what was coming.<br />I cannot state any better, Keep doing your best and in writing good fiction !
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the greatest game ( games). the time flies when I play this app. great for passing the time. I highly recommend. it downloaded super fast too....
B001AITGWE|5.0|you do not get 20 more words!<br />It kept me at the chair's Edge!<br />It was wonderful to the end!<br />Excellent
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the Downton series, although I hate paying $1.99 to catch up the episodes I missed. I think 99cents would be better.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game is well paced has a good difficult curve and is actually fun.  Unique enough that it doesn't just feel like another clone
B0086700CM|3.0|Haven't quite figured out how this got ordered on the kindle but anyway it is ok but hadn't planned on purchasing i t.
B0030B1WBM|5.0|This movie couldn't have been done this well if it were not for Carey!  Wonderful christmas classic, put a little light in your hearts - even the scrooge would smile
B0049J0CTM|1.0|I did not like this movie. Then again, I'm a grown man. My 3 year old lost intrest. A couple scenes scared him. Also a bit long for us.
B002LBKDYE|5.0|actually my diabetes doctor suggested that i buy this dvd, i was kind of grossed out at first, but have watch it a number of times
0765325950|5.0|I have read this series over a period of about 7 years. I grew to know the characters within the book as if they were my friends. It is sad to see it end even though some may say it should have ended many books ago. There were hard spots to get through near the middle of the series, but believe me when I say its worth the work.<br /><br />The final book ends it all in astounding fashion. I read and imagined in my head the Last Battle unfold as told through Sanderson's riveting writing. I saw comrades I had grown to enjoy cut down right in front of my eyes. I actually felt a pang of sadness when these events happened.<br /><br />A book has not given me an emotional connection like this in a long time. No other book series has this much character development and world building than the Wheel of Time series. To read from book 1 to 14 is a journey that can only be completed by persons that have a drive to see things through to the end. I know many that started it and gave up around book 5. Yes it gets tiresome, but as it nears the end the pace quickens and events all begin to point towards the Last Battle.<br /><br />A Memory of Light will always be remembered by me as one of the best epic tales ever written.
B009MO5960|5.0|i am collecting all of these movies<br />and this was the last one so far..<br />the movie was great and came in great shape
1616550414|4.0|I liked this book alot but it did not go into extreme detail about what I though was the zelda history. While it experatly shows sketchs of most of the charitors, it does explain the time line and some of the past games in the sequence of the timelines. The best part was the time lines and it did explain that quite well, but a great deal of the book is sketches, so think about it before buying it unless that is what you were looking for. Also their are a whole lot of spolers if you havn't played skyward sword. Just saying.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I liked this book because it has a lot of adventure and mythology and it has a lot of humor and it is a really good book,I think you would like it too. At the end there is a book review and it had a really good beginning.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I thought at first I was not going to like this book.It was hard to understand and I considered not reading. But, I was drawn in and was surprised at the course it took ...the ending was a surprise and the author left a hint of their future that allows you to draw your own conclusions.
B005J2V74C|3.0|...for a reality show type of movie.  I think it was sort of scary  in a Blair Witch Project way.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's great to watch the show just a day after it airs. Amazon has great quality and allows for those of us who don't have cable (or if you missed it) to watch the episode for 2 bucks.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is, simply, hilarious. If you don't understand sarcasm this is maybe not the book for you. I lol'd my way through the entire book.  More please!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the option of purchasing the TV pack so that the episodes were waiting for me the minute they released. I also got to see the entire rest of the season a few weeks early as a perk (along with the minimal discount). The convenience is worth it.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|What else can I say - it was ok. Certainly not in the Oscar category in my opinion.  Chris Bell
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie is awesome. I initially saw it in the theaters as a reason to get out of the house, but we were cracking up 5 minutes in and didn't stop the entire movie. We rented it from Amazon again when we had company over and laughed even more. Obviously not for kids :)
B007SGM084|1.0|It's a good book for its gender but it's just very poorly written. If you are the kind of person that really enjoys a good book this is not for you.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It's great to watch the show just a day after it airs. Amazon has great quality and allows for those of us who don't have cable (or if you missed it) to watch the episode for 2 bucks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it looks so realistic!!!!this is a great. you should get this game. the only bad part is the advertisements. they pop up pretty often.
B000YHG72E|4.0|This movie, while being newer than the standards, is an instant classic in our house. It's hilarious and endearing at the same time. So clever and enjoyable.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|This movie is no where near as good as the original but is fun to kill some time if you like sword and sorcery stories.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Crashed after three minutes on my kindle fire. it uninstalled,but still shows up on the device and I cant reinstall. way to go<br /><br />EDIT: After my Kindle was turned off and on a couple of times it allowed me to install the game. It was worth the trouble. The game is pretty addictive. It still doesn't get four stars, because to get the most out of the game you'll need to sync up your Facebook with it. I serendipitously discovered that signing out of Facebook made my park disappear. I logged back in, my park was there as-was, but I had 10 gems I didn't have before. This is great if you didn't have any to begin with (like me), but I'm wondering if your gems will disappear if you actually had some bought. Wouldn't want to chance it.
B009369Z8A|1.0|A friend recommended this and said it was incredible and one of the best he's seen. This movie was so freakin' bad I could not make it to the end. Completely uninteresting and extremely poor acting. I've seen better in most made for TV movies or even the Dukes of Hazzard! What the hell was this director even thinking!!?? I'm still angry about renting it on Netflix and wasting the time. I suspect my friend was drinking moonshine at the time of viewing.
B0091VOCAS|5.0|This is a magical film and is both beautiful and charming. A great date movie or Valentine's Day movie if you want to make some romance at home.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Written well enough to be entertaining and has plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested.  Good solid read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love that I can get some stress out and play a quick fun game. Waiting at the school for my kids,or sitting in a parking lot to pass some time lol...
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This album is one that reaks of emotion. Every song takes you to a place in a relationship, whether is be the beginning, end or before it has really even started.  Love they Say and Closer have become two tracks I can't keep off and playlist...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The application of scientific analysis by a trained physician to the spiritual experience was facinating. As an engineer I found this  enlightening.
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|THANKS IT JUST HERE TODAY AND IT WAS FOR A GIFT FOR GOOD FRIEND OF MY'S I WILL ORDER SOME MORE SOON
B004Q7CIFI|2.0|Good book probably deserves more than two stars, and the reason I only gave it two stars was, drum roll please, EVERYONE knows there was a second shooter on the grassy knoll in Dallas. OSWALD WAS A PATSY.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Great album , in fact best in years. Great work musically especially with the bass and drums. Much edgier then Snakes and Arrows. Can't miss if you are a Rush fan.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I find with the 50 shades books you kind of waiting for something significant to happen but it never quite gets there.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the game itself.  Play Solitaire on my desktop.  On my Kindle, I would like to have an option where you can place the cards on the top row (the Aces) as they are in the portrait mode for the landscape mode.  Not a big thing, but I like them on the top all the time.<br /><br />I am with the other folks, the pop up ads are annoying.  Especially those like match.com that it looks like you HAVE to click on the ad or shut down the system to get rid of the thing.  It took a bit of messing around to figure out to touch under the ad to get rid of it.  That is aggravating to the user and probably will turn a lot of people off to using these free game aps.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Worth reading and very well written,  Alot of characters to follow so you have to stay awake.  Would be good if JK wrote another adult book.
B004TI5N38|5.0|kept me enthralled the whole story, loved the characters, I have learned I can't go wrong with a Baldacci read.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Not well written.<br />An easy read though.  You feel you have to read the next book for something to happen.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Got it as a gift for my husband for Christmas.  If you are a Led Zeppelin fan you will love this!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Not well written, a basic read.  Felt like the author got lazy half way through and in a rush to just finish writing the last book.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I've skimmed through the comments and it seems really good. so I installed it. Honestly it's very slow. I've never really played the game since it freezes so much.
145470246X|5.0|Köszönöm, a könyv nagyon szép.Sok jól használható mintát tartalmaz! A szállítás gyors volt! Megbízható eladó,ajánlom másnak is bizalommal vásároljon tőle.
B0000CC5CS|5.0|This is a great bargain moive as what advertised. It's also a classical action movie. The scenes of the movie may have violence and destruction contents, but it's should make action lovers feel excited. Thanks Amazon for offering such a great movie to us.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So far lots of fun for filling those few minutes waiting on something else.  Kind of adictive though, so be careful if you have a deadline!
B007JMW46U|5.0|I have read a few of these stories before in other hardback collections. It is nice to have them all together and on Kindle so that I can alter the text. I am older and my vision poorer than when I last read them. Also nice to have the illustrations. Love that sort of thing in books and in the older Sherlock Holmes movies of the Seventies. Love the stories and the atmosphere of the time they bring to my mind. Unrealistic maybe? Maybe. Still perfect.
144233620X|2.0|I must admit that I am only halfway through this book but am so disappointed that I had to come here and vent.  I read Love, Anthony, Genova's third book and loved it.  When I commented at how much I enjoyed this book, others told me to read Still Alice, Genova's first book which was better.  Rather than read it, though, I decided to listen to it when I found the audio version at the library and began it yesterday. Much to my surpriswe the author read the book which I found interesting.  But more than interesting I found her delivery most annoying.  To begin with her voice is rather flat and then she has a most irritating hab it of mispronouncing words like shouldn't, wouldn't and couldn't and reads them as should should ent, etc..  It is most annoying and I would think she would have been corrected as this was discovered but.....Also the book is too technical about Alzheimer's and I understand this as the author herself is highly educated in the field of neuroscience.  But I would bet most of her reade4rs are not.<br /><br />For the reasons above I have decided to switch to reading the book instead.  And perhaps when I have finished, I will come back and rerate this book and nchange my review.  Let's hope so.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A different type of book - not like one I've read before. Dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe this family! Kept me reading though because I just had to find out how they could wrap up this story!
B003K1EYM6|1.0|The &#34;Apple&#34; iPad camera connection kit for the iPad included 1. a connector that would NOT fit an SD card (the slot is not wide enough), 2. no instruction booklet, 3. the two items were dirty, scratched and obviously previously used, and 4. the box was also dirty. The images on the SD card connector do not match those on the kit I purchased from Apple. There is no Apple icon on the box. The UPC label matches that on a legitimate kit purchased from Apple in most respects although it's missing one symbol.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was tragic but amazing at the same time. I just wish I knew what happened to everyone else in the epilogue
B007TKT2SK|5.0|If you cook or do wood working you need this. No more trying to find a common denominator or converting to decimal. Just enter the first fraction, select the function, enter the second fraction, and hit enter.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|i have not been able to launch it yet, i don't see any of category to select for that opinion
B007EC27QM|5.0|It's a calculator what more can I say. But this one looks good and is very intuitive. It's perfect for most simple math problems and ideal for totaling grocery bills and balancing that check book. I've tried several other calculators that look like someone wrote them at 3 AM after doing too much caffeine. This one is very professional
0375842209|5.0|Wow. This book hits you like a punch to the guts. It's the kind of book you're afraid to keep reading, but do so anyway. Nazi Germany is probably the single most disconcerting historical period to write in. Even after reading and watching a whole ton of material on it, I still have no grasp of how things happened the way they did. It boggles my mind.<br /><br />At it's core, it's a story about relationships, and all of Liesel's relationships are touching in one way or another. I don't want to give too much away, but I teared up on a couple of occasions. But don't go thinking the story is all dark. There are some uplifting moments to complement the darkness.<br /><br />All in all, this is a wonderful story of the human spirit.
0307277453|4.0|Very well presented, and really kept my attention.  Anyone who doubts that &#34;evolution&#34; exists should spend some time with this book.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|No matter how many times you see this movie - it is still on of the best action, collaborative movies that you will see - until the next Avengers movie (hopefully)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The instructions for some of the minipuzzles could be better written. Had to go to the cheat just to figure out what the puzzle was asking for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is the best game I have never played a great game it is the most popular game
B00B7Y0206|4.0|If you are familiar with you tube from using it on other devices then you will have no problem using it on the kindle.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of pi an inspirational story that shows the courage and trust of humans and the fiercest of animals.  Shevana
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The App is ok. Facebook is just becoming a little tedious. Maybe because of the people that feel the need to post every second of their life's they ultimately are wasting by posting to begin with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Long story short I been wanting to read the bible for years,I simply never had the time for it.this is an amazing app, it has plans from 3 days to 366 days and reminds you. Relating to things from worry to stress to dating to suicide to integrity. Very thankful for this app. Most plans are 7 days, manageable and believable, short enough with enough meat to connect you with hope and God. If your going through a hard time finding hope for yourself, this is it. Thank you.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good App. Does what you expect. I like that you can monitor many locations. A must for all my device users if you have any outdoor or travel plans.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I have it on my iphone and I love to play it. ITS EVEN better on my kindle, the graphics are awesome.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Omg this book is AMAZING!!!!! Love the mom in the book. This is a pretty dark book but great I love it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am sooooo looking forward to the next episode! Left us wanting more. I sure hope to see Daryl back!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Erotic story with stomach clenching passages. So, who doesn't dream of a rich, and<br /> o gorgeous sexy lover. This author is very good at this description stuff.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game, it is better than the first temple run. I have it on my kindle fire and my phone.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Extremely well-written and captivating story. I have recommended it to many friends.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This was a very interesting read. However, instead of so much back story, I wish Dr. Alexander would have discussed more about what he saw and learned on the other side. The &#34;afterlife&#34; part of this book was extremely lacking and after all, that is why I purchased the book.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This &#34;duo&#34; is one of the greatest rock &#34;bands&#34; of all time.  It amazes me the sound that is generated from just 2 guys.  Old school blues and they don't pretend to be something they're not.  And the love they have for their music shows through each and every song on this album (are they still called albums?!).  The Black Keys never cease to amaze me...this might be their best one yet.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This &#34;game&#34; does absolutely nothing to entertain, inform, tickle the imagination.  It's an absolute total waste.  No one should even look at this.
1401207529|5.0|We never got this book even tho it said we did. yet we waited forever in a half for it. it was an amazing book tho i loved it yet i wouldnnt buy it from this shipper again tho
B005K17RU0|4.0|It has worked for me every time. Seem to be right on  when I go to it and gives me the information I need.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|I love the author's play of words. Still in the process of reading it, I want to enjoy every page so I am taking my time with this one.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Very helpful at times. Nice to know its there if you need it. I didn't buy the upgraded version so there has been a couple of words it didn't have.
098555780X|5.0|This is a great instruction manual. Lots of attractive patterns and easy to follow instructions with pictures.  I've been deemed as &#34; best Uncle ever&#34; by my great nieces.  I recommend to anyone who wants to do more than standard cobra weave.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|This was both enjoyable and a bit depressing as I have an older dog and it made me think about mortality.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A very well written book. I thoroughly enjoyed the read. I plan to read more books by Grisham. Grisham keeps the reader engrossed!
B000JFDBXO|5.0|This is probably my favorite X-Men movies. Every actor was at their finest, it was well filmed, and the action was intense without being over-bearing. I think it is unfortunate that they didn't make a fourth one right away, especially considering the closing cliff-hangers. However, having said that each actor was at their finest, it was Ian McKellan who stole the show for me. No one else could have given us a Magneto like he did, proving what a talented actor he is. He is intimidating, yet we sympathize with him, and though he might seem at times like a villain, I cannot help but root for him. Patrick Stewart as his counterpart plays his role with almost equal talent, and Hugh Jackman does a great job as Wolverine. Great movie!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the rope is awesome. Especially with the new lantern level. You'll love on nom the cute monster you give candy. Look out for hidden pictures. Om nom makes them fir u. Look at the badges you get.and look at New videos
B00004ST9Q|4.0|It arrived promptly and without any deficits to it.  It has many songs that remember being performed by Whitney Houston.
B007HJ91HU|3.0|Horrible remake! First off classics are made to be left alone this just goes to show you Hollywood has no idea how to make a good movie anymore. I mean visuals don't make a moviehowever special effects is there to take the movie on a journey with good story line not be the storyline because storyline was rushed just to sell another picture.Case in point the girl with the dragon tattoo I mean come on guys really. Noomi rapace made that movie better than an international movie should have been.  Daniel Craig was good as well as rooney but it just to me lost something in the cast that made the movie. Julianne huff is very pleasent on the eyes but the movie was crap compared predecessor. Ms huff will have a good carreer I think though.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|It arrived promptly and without any deficits to it.<br />Great movie!!!  I will probably watch it over and over again for years to come.
B004MPJZ1O|5.0|One of the greastest subjectified women movies ever made. Now I'm not saying that raps is anything that should be laughed at but it was a novelty peice for its time
1449415881|5.0|This calendar arrived before Christmas; it was a Christmas present for my husband.  He loves it!!!  It brightens his mornings!!!
B009329Y30|4.0|Was hoping for more story but other than that good show. Not your typical chick flick but it does resemble the note book however but was still enjoyable none the less.
B000001ABD|5.0|The CD arrived promptly and without any deficits to it.<br />It has some great songs!  It has all the songs that you remember Stevie Wonder performing.
B004MPESSY|4.0|Well done remake for a change but still doesn't replace the original. Sarah has a fantastic body and can act really well under adversaty. I like the remake but I needed more from the story itself like protaganists be more aggressive in there approach not some guy with a mental problem stealing more camera time than the rest.
B00006JSS8|5.0|The CD arrived promptly and without any deficits to it.<br />It has some great songs!  It has some great songs by Stevie Wonder.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Descent file explorer but I'm not a genious so the setup is alittle over my headas far being tech conious but was still usable.
B000002VMD|5.0|The CD arrived promptly and without any deficits to it.<br />The CD is awesome!!!  It showcases Whitney Houston's powerful and beautiful voice.
B0058W74UY|1.0|This app is borely done. Takes up to much space and is a lot more heavy on storage than windows media player
B000002VSN|5.0|The CD arrived promptly and without any deficits to it.<br />The CD is great!!!  I has all my favorite songs Whitney performed.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|Baseball has been my favorite passtime since I was little. So to watch the movie from a gm perspective was a treat to know the other side that was previously unheard of.
B000UDNBQW|3.0|Not really my taste, but well written. Had interesting insight to life on that island and nice comparisons to great expectations
B007BVOF8E|5.0|It has been a long time since I have seen such a good british/english spy thiller that was this good with an all star cast that rocks you to the core from the jump.
B0024396WE|5.0|Excellent movie! Received quickly and boxed securely for delivery. The movie is riveting from start to finish and the music so delicate, yet haunting. Roman Polanski has set the bar to another height. He is always directed great movies in the past century. \\"The Pianist\\" is a great movie and will be an enduring one.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Use this app a lot however not design to sync with the kindle hopefully they will get it right in the near future use this app for school as well as other activities like d&d transfer non Usb which I like and hey its free
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Wow. I read the first one and<br /> I was  hooked. I loved it. 5 stars! Yay. I can't wait for the third book
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|A must have for viewing pdf files or video files that are in pdf form. Love using it when I get my statements from my bank or to download a job application. To put it lightly it makes my day alittle easier with a pdf viewer on hand.
B00821OX98|5.0|Best show out there. Just wish it was full seasons and not short summer time seasons.Ist syfy family drama all rolled into one. The cast isnt a bunch of perfect models there real looking and acting everyday people.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I really enjoyed this set I recommend this to everyone because it has everything you could want in a story that spans through a family line along with there enemies to tell a compelling drama. My only regret is the next book is not included in the set but still can be found on site.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Russell Crowe is absolutely wonderful in this love story set in Provence.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Russell Crowe, wine, watching movies set in France or sweet love stories.
B007Z9RAX4|5.0|The latest incarnation of an mma star becoming a movie star and doesn't disappoint from the start . Fast paced action with enough dialogue to keep you interested but I found it didn't have enough to separate itself from the bourne & hanna throwbacks. Still enjoyed it would love to see more from her in the near future.thank you
B00009XITP|5.0|Great movie. Amanda Bynes is just adorable.  I watch it with my teenage daughters often.  I recommend it to anyone who loves chick flicks or Amanda Bynes.
B007URCTOG|3.0|Deffinitly a chick flick. Disbite channing tatum being very believeable as a husband who losses his wife to amnesia who then makes her fall for him again just seams like another run of the mill love story.was  I don't think the female lead Rachel mcadams did a convincing job as well as she could have done. Therefore three stars seams suffice. Thank you still a good moviebut not great.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We are totally addicted to this series.  We had to buy the third season to watch them without waiting for the next episode to come on tv.  There is much heart ache and sadness and the ending is totally disappointing.
B00AAQ7JNA|2.0|I just received this blue ray and is so sad that the sound is so terrible that doesn't give you any excitement at all to see it. I have the blue ray of her previous tour and is totally a different experience. I'm so disappointed that I did read the reviews before. At first I thought that the one I received was damage until I start reading. An artist at that level should get involved in details so important like that.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I think they could have easily cut this movie by about 1/2 hour and made some drastic changes to the story line.  I mean, come on, the bad guy is going to exact his revenge on Batman by making Gotham suffer for months and then right when he is going to destroy Gotham is thwarted by some last minute BS.<br /><br />I understand that this is sort of the story of Batman, long drawn out plots, but this takes the cake.<br /><br />I enjoyed the 2nd movie the best, the first one was pretty good, but this one sucked and sucked and sucked and then sucked some more (I needed four 'sucks' to emphasize the fact that this movie seemingly never ends).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't get enough of this program series!!Downtown Abbey!!Its such a clear picture and the set up on Kindle Fire is excellent!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I Loved the book! Unbelievable and sinister twists and turns!  The author did an amazing job at keeping the reader guessing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good old fun game, easy to play and master. Suitable for all ages,would recommend. Highly addictive. Plays well on kindle
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Ok so I have finished the third book and all I can say is wow. I loved the story but hated how the apartheid of the book was turning out. It was intense but not at all the way I had hoped. I was thoroughly impressed with the writing around the Wall and the war that raged there.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|This wasn't the best version of Jane Eyre I've ever seen. If I didn't already know the story line, I would have been hard pressed to keep up with what was happening. The storytelling style was disjointed at best. I wish I had rented this before I put my money where my mouth was for this one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I downloaded the second series of Downton Abbey on my Kindle HD to watch while traveling.  Once home, I discovered it was easy to hook up my Kindle to my TV and watch at home!  Purchased the Kindle HD and the video on Amazon.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|The premise is funny but the acting is just a B+. The main reason the rating was low for me was the crudeness. Amanda Price says several crude phrases that made me cringe instead of laugh and there were several other not-so-great things in this movie that it could've done without (and the story would have been better for it).<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to many if any of my friends.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I love the Celtic Woman.  I listen to their music all the time and watch their dvds.  I plan on seeing them this summer in Boise
B001SGEUNI|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands from today's area in music. Most of the music today sucks except for very few bands like godsmack korn and a few more. I'm 23 and I'm a huge 80's Heavy Metal and hard Rock fan!!!! I love how this band is not only hard rock but can be metal at times to and they don't sound like alot of the stupid s*** we listen to today. Today in my opinion music has poured down the drain and most people don't have the talent like the people think they do. I love lizzy Hale's voice she has the most beautiful voice and has played in concert with some really cool people like slash. Her Brother Arejay is crazy on the drums.  Everybody else is really good too. I recently bought there new album on Vinyl and I would really be happy if they pressed this album on vinyl as well. The sound of a record is amazing I think my favorite song \\"I GET OFF\\" will sound even more amazing. If your just checking this band out just buy the cd you won't be disappointed and checkout the new one.  Greg
B00AWE9TCE|5.0|Lego Chima is the best Lego product ever!<br /><br />Are you looking for a great Lego set?<br />Well, you should get Lego Chima!  It is about animals like the wolf, tiger, eagle, raven, monkey, rhino, bear and crocodile.  Some of them are enemies and some of them are friends.<br /><br />Lego Chima is awesome.  One reason I love Lego Chima is that the animal tribes are animals that drank chi water and then were transformed into animals/human form.<br /><br />Another reason I love Lego Chima is chi. Chi is a power source that gives the tribes special powers.<br /><br />Another reason I love Lego Chima is the Speedorzs.  You pull the ripcord on the Speedorzs, and then you put them down on a flat surface and they go flying!<br /><br />One more awesome thing about Lego Chima is the great beasts.  The great beasts are animals that didn't drink the chi water so they stayed the same.  There is only one great beast for each type of animal.<br /><br />The final reason I love Lego Chima is that there is a TV show about Lego Chima!<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a great Lego product with a related TV show, you should get Lego Chima!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I wish I had never loaded it on my Kindle and I plan to remove it as soon as I can figure out how to do so.  Sorry.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you like building things, this game is made for you.  Minecraft is so awesome.  It cost thirty dollars on the computer, but there are other versions.  The best thing about Minecraft is you can create anything you want.<br /><br />  One reason Minecraft is so awesome is because it has so many mods. Mods are settings that can be changed.  There are survival mods, creative mods and adventure mods, and there are others you can download.  Also, you can blow things up with T.N.T.  I once built a T.N.T. tower and blew it up, it was very exciting!<br /><br />  Another reason why Minecraft is so awesome is that it supports so many electronic devices.  It can be played on P.C.'s, or Macs.  There is also an Android version, I-Pod, and I-Pad.<br /><br />  With Minecraft you can build many objects with bricks.  For example you can build villages, houses, dugouts, forts and so many other things.  Bricks can be many colors including red, green, purple, blue and so on.<br /><br />  As you can see, Minecraft is fantastic! I have the computer version which I love.  If you like constructing anything you should definitely get at least one version of this game.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like this video and the workout- they present a good challenge and make me feel like i'm getting a good exercise in. But, you're supposed to do the same workout for 10 days in a row and never changing it up? Ever heard of muscle memory?! It gets boring. I've recently revamped my exercise regimen and i'm doing this every other day so as not to bore myself or let my body get used to it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Very chill ;<br /><br />Now i need more words to finish the review<br />ok review is now finished , well ok now it is

B0052UZIFA|4.0|OK the game is great just google it but I made this to inform you that it never gets updated like the play store version.<br />So if u have access to the play store get it there.
B009CGCQPU|5.0|excelent movie... if you are a romantic at heart. will definately watch it again and recomend it to friends and family
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Share my opinion....it's this greatest. I must keep typing to validate this review. It's awesome and great and super and sweet
B004K58GSO|5.0|great movie, I love john wayne's movies he is and was a great actor, would definately recomend this movie to friends and family
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Lots of twists, suspense, interesting characters. A page turner.<br />Recommend it for its compelling but unusual story. Not likable characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My favorite character is Maggie Smith but I could watch this show over and over!  This show not only has a castle that is marvelous but its characters are fascinating and<br />each show makes you want to see the next one. Come on Season 4!!!!!
B00AZ3KPZC|5.0|This movie is a classic that my children love to watch over and over.  I definitely would recommend this for all ages
B00B2G2RG6|1.0|Lacks character depth and relies too much on shock value. For a series to be successful<br />it has to have more than this one provides.
B00846F1YW|1.0|I suppose its too much to ask for...that the items I am searching for be on the screen.. not behind the menue bar.... and you have to spend five minutes tapping in the same spot to get it..... or that you can tap on the object directly and it will give to a pentalty and take away time for tapping randomly..yeah....I'm  pretty sure I'm tapping on the right thing. I understand a few glitches.. but when the object isn't on the screen its pretty pathetic for a hidden objects game ..
B007KOMTUI|2.0|In 5 it lacks everything that made it magical in the beginning.  The characters are ho-hum<br />and the story does not draw me to the next show.  It is boring!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I was surprised to see a vulnerable 007.  However, it was a wonderful movie; beautifully filmed, stunning.<br />Highly recommended!  Prepare to be surprised.
B00797MB0O|2.0|Story of a pathetic woman who at the end of the movie is still pathetic. Moves slowly and is not funny or touching.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game keeps me awake during my long shift of monitoring bleeps and blips. Highly entertaining and fast paced which is good for keeping the mind sharp when doing work like mine.
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|As dark as promised, this one doesn't shy away from explicit scenes. Very morbid. That said, it's brave, well written and keeps you reading. Flynn definitely honed her style in Gone Girl, but this is a strong and entertaining novel nonetheless.
B000PVAFT0|2.0|Wow.  LAME.<br /><br />I'd like to be cute and quote some of the genuine stinker one-liners from this script but this movie doesn't deserve that much effort going into a review.<br /><br />Bottom line: the footage is great, but no better than, say, \\"Nature,\\" or \\"Nova\\" or \\"National Geographic\\" or a BBC nature show.  What absolutely RUINS this film is the narration and Hollywood B-movie sound effects.  I am about 20 minutes in of passive watching but I'm not going to finish it.  And it's not like a BBC David Attenborough film is all that high brow.  Those films also have sound tracks full of emotional cues and also use pretty absurd sound effects (Hollywood alien movie noises when showing jelly fish, for example) but at least the narration isn't so dumb.  And David Attenborough's speaking voice makes everything sound at least a bit more intelligent.  But honestly, no one could deliver the lines from Imax Deep Sea in an intelligent way.  This is just a dumb movie.  Don't waste your time.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|this book was so beguiling, I didn't expect much but I was so charmed by this book and the main character's journey that I could not put it down.  I could relate to Harold's disappointment in himself and the life he had led, or more accurately, the life he had not led.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great little app that show you information about your device.  It shows you the percentage of battery you have on your device and how much Music playback,video playback, internet browsing, and talktime you get with the amount of battery you have.
0765325950|4.0|\\"A Memory of Light\\" concludes the fourteen volume saga \\"The Wheel of Time\\" as it attempts to address the numerous characters introduced over the years at \\"The Last Battle\\" with the Dark One.  Throughout the series, dozens of characters have been developed and is the reason the storyline has become overwhelmed.  One could argue there were originally three protagonists with some secondary support characters, which probably should have been the focus the entire time.  Rest assured, the final novel addresses as many individuals as possible, from the original three to Rand's three wives, Mat's wife, Perrin's wife, Lan, select Aes Sedai, the Forsaken, Olver, and stable boy #2.<br /><br />Some things do not change, such as Egwene's arrogant opinion of others and everyone bullying the other.  While Mat doesn't appear for the first 250 pages, I found he has the strongest presence during the latter half.  Perrin doesn't entertain me much, overall I've found him to be pretty bland.  Rand focuses on the task at hand battling the Dark One, limiting his diversity.<br /><br />A couple items bothered me.  First everyone is consistently tired, Egwene and her sa'angreal, always drawing more and more despite their exhaustion, Lan fighting tired, Elayne fighting tired, and Avendia fighting tired.  Spies everywhere for the Shadow.  While the surprise Sharan army with no history to suddenly appear was a poor plot device, I'm relieved they weren't introduced earlier as they'd have consumed another four books traveling down the road, characters being captured and escaping, Perrin lamenting over Faile, and so forth.  The amazing battles drag out sometimes, and don't expect everyone to die in a heroic moment.  Quick and meaningless deaths will happen, more than likely a character or couple readers' hope will survive won't have a happy ending.  There could have been a small \\"where are they now\\" chapter chronicling the survivors, however I'll think a happy ending myself.<br /><br />The enormous assortment of major and minor characters leaves one desperate for a thorough glossary.  It is inexcusable not having the Aes Sedai and their respective Ajah colors and hierarchy, all the characters in this specific novel without spoilers, and the Foresaken addressed by the glossary.  Eventually I search the internet using keywords \\"wheel of time\\", \\"glossary\\", and \\"characters\\" to find the answers on a reliable website.<br /><br />Overall I think Mr. Sanderson did an acceptable job with the material he probably had available though there are character inconsistencies as he didn't create them and develop them in his mind over the decades.  He provided the fans closure regardless if it is up to their standards or not, the dead cannot write so accept his material or not.  Mr. Jordan could not have finished the novel anyway in one final book given his propensity of garment descriptions and braid tugging.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel to any fan of either author or the series.<br /><br />Thank you.s assortment of major and minor characters leaves one desperate for a thorough glossary.

B0043UB0EI|4.0|If you like sex and violence or one of the two you will enjoy this show.  Its a lot of fun to watch.  The blood splatter cracks me up because they intensify it which makes in look over the top.  Good show.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL does everything a good comedy should; i.e., it reveals a great deal about life, death, love, and happiness without ever seeming preachy or pretentious, remaining, on the surface, simply a light, entertaining film. TBEMH involves seven very different yet equally discontented British people who, all for different reasons, travel to a \\"resort\\" hotel in Jaipur, India. The hotel does not turn out to be all that was advertised, and therein lies much of the comedy. Owner/manager \\"Sonny\\" (Dev Patel) is eager to make his establishment work, and the way his stereotypically Indian bombastic hyperbole contrasts with the Brits' stereotypically staid understatement is, well, noteworthy. Although the film has one or two \\"lol\\" moments, much of the humor is of a quieter variety that is shaped by this contrasting dialogue.<br /><br />Outstanding cinematography, with some really exquisite Indian scenery. Great acting by all, and Judi Dench gives an especially memorable performance as Evelyn Greenslade. While there is not a lot of really intense, dramatic action, nor is there a dull moment. Wonderful ending: The characters all undergo some often small  yet always substantial changes, and so should anyone who watches this film.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What a wonderful voice Adele has.  She is so great that I would rate her good for anything of hers that I will get.  She is one of the most amazing voices that I have heard from a female singer in a long time.  Hope she continues.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As a fan of the comics I had high expectations for the show. It was going to be impossible to simply take the comic and make it into a television series to make it work. But they've done it. They have successfully taken everything that was at the core of the comics — all that made it good and right — and translated it into a television series. They have changed what should be (and had to be) changed and left all else alone. They have successfully communicated all that was awesome and horrifying about the idea into another media.<br /><br />This show is NOT just about &#34;zombies.&#34; It is about the human condition. It is a heart wrenching, gut twisting journey of emotion. You will most likely see yourself in a different light after watching it... understand yourself more... and find that you do, in fact, believe in a right and wrong that originates outside of circumstance, society, or even &#34;free will.&#34;<br /><br />If you've not watched &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; try to do so.

1469220660|4.0|This is my first review of any book but I felt compelled to counteract some of the downright outrageous slander of this book. First off, it is understandable why there are those who find it extremely comparable to the 'Fifty Shades' trilogy. However, the sequel definitely puts that to rest. There is a difference between Gideon and Christian and it is ridiculous to compare the two. Also, Eva and Ana are polar opposites. Eva has a different past and is definitely not as inexperienced as Ana. For those who love a heart-melting love story that just might bring you to the brink of tears conjoined with drama that will have you yellig to the book as if the characters can hear you, this is the book for you.<br />A piece of advice - read it separate from Fifty Shades because it stands on its own. Try not to compare the two and you will allow yourself to experience the greatness of the book.<br />- RE

There are so many things going on you cannot afford to miss one single minute or you can get severely lost. I strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the real deal in zombie movies or the horror genre all together.  The Walking Dead is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish and you will find yourself rooting for the underdogs every time.

In any case, like another review stated, I found it very fair and balanced. And I have to admit, I was also especially interested in this account, after having had a personal encounter with Shirley Maclaine, once while working at the Jules Stein Eye Institute in the UCLA medical complex.  This was back in the 80's, and I was looking forward to meeting the famous actress, since I held a great deal of respect for her spiritual pursuits. But as it turns out, I ended up being quite disappointed.  Because from the moment Ms. Maclaine entered the waiting area, she started shouting out personal demands, such as the waiting room furniture needing to be rearranged for her, and other personal demands, that were clearly not part of the services rendered by our staff.  At any rate, it became clear to me, and all the other staff, that she was a highly irrational person, clearly seeing herself as \\"superior in evolution\\" to every person in that room....which for me, goes against even the basic precepts of spirituality.  I will never forget how Ms. Maclaine displayed not one ounce of grace or respect towards anyone around her (and for me, this *is* the most basic trait of *true* spiritual evolution). And how her behavior was more demeaning to herself than anyone else.<br /><br />In any case, after that encounter, I realized that the universe was teaching me a very important lesson about the appearances that people want to publicize about themselves, and that we can't always believe them....that we always need to go deeper to see the truth. And it also made me see, that people like Ms. Maclaine, who consider themselves to be \\"superior, spiritual\\" beings....have clearly been channeling too many, very delusional energies through their bodies. (So much so that, in my opinion, it has probably fragmented her mind, beyond all repair now.) In any case, for these reasons and Ms. Parker's own personal reasons, I highly congratulate her for traversing the obstacle of her mother in this lifetime!d Ms. Parker's own personal reasons, I highly congratulate her for traversing the obstacle of her mother in this lifetime!
B0063M22QO|1.0|It is difficult to use. When finished with the first game, the background freezes and I couldn't figure out how to go to another option without getting out of the product.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|fantastic game,  loads of fun.  this game went on for hours and it was so worth it.  I highly recommend it.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Fairly decent game, liked the puzzles.  The find it puzzles are numerous, could do with a few more of the other types. The conversations were a bit silly but you can skip through them.  Overall not bad at all.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I Bought This For my Wife.  She listens to it Every Day First night she went to sleep withit playing
B0014KFV6I|5.0|One thing that bothered me was the fact that when I downloaded the album to I Tunes, the album art did not come too.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love that this story is so much about this two couple and their lives.  I can't  wait for the final book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Awesome I love how it play but sometimes it will crash that's why I give it a four star instead of a five.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Even-thought I believe this is a very good love story  for teenagers, I really enjoyed it . The story in this book  is very real real.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I replaced the thermal compound on my CPU, my mother's CPU, and I'm going to get my Xbox 360 done right after I acquire the correct screwdriver set - I should even have enough to get some local neighborhood computers done. For a small fee, I'll probably earn my money back and buy another tube.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I love every song on this CD.  What beautiful voices! I would recommend this CD for anyone who appreciates beautiful music and singing.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was fun but not for little kids but it was fun and the story was good I'm finding I like Alawar Ent too.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|So far so good. hidden objects with some good puzzles and just hard enough to keep you on your toes guessing where to go next.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|I had to miss this in theaters at Christmas because of a sick mother.  It will be even more special to sit and watch this movie with her now.  I've been in love with Barbra  my whole life (and I'm a Republican) so of course I'm gonna get the DVD.  This movie should have come out on Mother's Day and it would have made $100 million.  I think \\"Parental Guidance\\" stole some of the \\"Guilt Trip\\" audience.  Anyway buy this DVD.  Barbra has been a huge star for 50 years and will still be a huge star 50 years from now.  She will always have an audience.  The extras on the Blu-ray look great.  Can't wait to see it.  \\"It's so nice to have you back where you belong\\".
B007ZYABW6|5.0|I'm in the publishing industry as an author and editor. I've written books and articles in the as-told-to style. I am nearly 100% positive that The Long Walk is non-fiction.<br />How do I know this?<br />I know what it takes to do an as-told-to account. It is unlikely for anyone to be able to dream up a full-length book and recite all the details accurately in a series of interviews with a professional writer unless it actually happened.<br />Writing a novel takes planning, copious written notes and editing. You don't get it right the first time.<br />Yes, I know the BBC alleged to have found evidence years later that Rawicz made up this epic story of flight through arctic tundra, desert and the most formidable range of mountains in the world. But where is the evidence? Why didn't they come forward long ago, before the death of Rawicz, so he could respond? Here's what I think: The BBC, like other media outlets, has an agenda, and a big part of that agenda is to protect the traditional image of Winston Churchill, who is blamed by Rawicz along with Franklin D. Roosevelt for allowing Rawicz' native land to fall under Communist control.<br />A critic opined that the description in the book of a yetti proves the story bogus. As a writer, I take the opposite position: I say it proves it true. No sensible writer would inject into his allegedly-true story something as certain to draw skepticism as an anecdote about a yetti...unless it actually happened.<br />If this story were untrue, some of the doctors and nurses in the hospital where Rawicz claimed to have sought medical help in India would have come forward a long time ago and debunked the story. None of them did, ergo, the story is true.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|As a college student I don't have all the time in the world to find different scriptures that relate to certain life struggles. I can choose a plan and read on my way to class now! It's easy to use and helps me keep up with God's word.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|I've bought & returned three different copies from 3 different sources. All three had the same problem - excessive surface noise on every disk. On some of the quieter passages it actually drowns out the music. One was bought at a music store & we checked all 4 copies they had in stock & all were the same. I had hoped to be able to put my Mobile Fidelity set away because of how valuable they are becoming but I guess I'm just going to have to be extra careful with them because nothing sounds better & when all is said & done it's the sound that matters. Funny thing though. Since there is no MFSL pressing of Past Masters I bought a stand alone remasterd version of the album that is the same as the one in the box. A world of difference - it sounds crisp & clean with absolutly zero surface noise. I also bough a stand alone copy of Magical Mystery tour since the MFSL version didn't have the booklet. Once again perfect. So I guess there are good versions out there, I just haven't seen one. I sure hope they have better quality control with the mono version when it comes out since that's the one I'm really looking forward to.
B000002URV|5.0|I love all kinds of music, and I especially love gregorian chants!  Not all people will like this, but I do.
0062101897|5.0|This is the ultimate book for HP movie fans.  It's very detailed with good pictures and behinds the scenes descriptions of everything from how-they-did-it to wardrobe to special effects.  Well worth the money for any fan.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It wasn't a cut and dry story, however it did end as expected. Little twists kept things interesting, fun story.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was amazing like a Nicholas sparks movie. I think it would be a good movie. Read it if u want a good love story

B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|I love that this book is concise.  I have been reading and typing in the code examples and doing the exercises.  It has been difficult at times but do-able.  I am impressed at how well concepts are explained.  I took 2 classes in Fortran twenty years ago, but I have not programmed for the past 20 years.  I would not suggest this book for someone who is totally new to programming.  As long as you have had some experience with coding, hopefully have a knowledgable friend to ask if you get stuck, and are willing to puzzle through the difficult parts, it is do-able.  And it is such a cool book!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is a great &#34;in your PJs&#34; movie. Super silly and not too graphic. There's definitely some LOL moments.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I received the item yesterday and it doesn't even work. Not worth paying and waiting for something that isn't going to work when you get it.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I love this movie. It's such a great comedy! I bought this for my bf as a surprise for his bday and have been quoting it since then &#34;THE FILES ARE IN THE COMPUTER!&#34; LOL
B001NHNG64|3.0|I chose only three stars because the subject seem dated from today’s prospective.  This is my least favorite of the series so far because, it is a little hard to get over an old story line.  I still recommend the book as a part of the series.

B000093BDX|4.0|And some junk too.  I couldn't think of any other hits I wanted to hear of theirs that weren't on here.  But it is a LONG cd. And the spare tracks are ones not from radio.  There's  a few I never even heard if.  I love this cd a lot, but have the skip button handy.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|this is a must see before Avengers, and great for the whole family. Would highly recommend this movie to all.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fabulously enjoyable game with lots of different themes from all over the world; however, I think that the characters are too expensive so if I was going to improve the game, I would make the characters cheaper so it would be easier to get them.<br /><br />Overall a very good game and I absolutely love it.<br /><br />Yours faithfully,<br /><br />Miss C Woodhead
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|The only problem with this series is that I stay up way to late watching it cause I have to see what happens next.
B008OOYALE|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!!Add dialga707 got super rare forestfire Dragon but not really good though.one adult Dragon too really cool good game
B004HY3BTC|5.0|This is almost as good as the original although this is good too. Number Five has changed his name to Johnny Five the two main charotars from the original are gone replaced by one of the supporting stars from the original and others but its still a good movie which you should get.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another great read! Took my time reading this one as its on my son's Kindle and I borrowed it for free and have to wait to get the last one to read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|There are so many anti bully programs but this is the best.  There will always be Julian's and as this book reinforces my theory that the parents need to change before bullying stops.
B002RI9UBS|3.0|Food for thought.<br />Very detailed. Perhaps too much so, as I tended to skip over paragraphs to get to the next bit.<br />But it is thought provoking as you can literally see life through his eyes and learn new perspectives.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It is a game that will get you upset, but in agood way.  It is a addicting game that makes you want to keep playing.
B003HKN52A|5.0|Actually my wife is the fan and was blown away by the content on the disc.<br />She did not expect such a wonder coverage of the kings' tour.<br />Recommended for viewing by all the fans and those that do no follow the King, could be converted.<br />Therefore that is the reason for her rating. 5 Stars thank you.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Somehow this was just as good or better  than the first book, I haven't decided. Highly addictive and a worthwhile read.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay was so different from what I imagined it would be like. I went through so many emotions reading this book just like with the previous two novels in the Hunger Games trilogy. But I have to say that while reading some of the last few chapters of this one...I was left with a feeling of wanting more. I wouldn't say it was rushed. Maybe I didn't want it to end. Maybe I was reading too fast. I don't know how to explain it. It all probably needs to sink in.<br /><br />Anyway, yes, I loved it. Mockingjay had some really amazing moments. And of course, there were a lot of dark, sad, scary moments that shocked me and almost made me cry. I could go on and on, but I'm still a bit shocked. So, I will say that the ending was bittersweet. And I got a bit teary-eyed. It was an unexpected and fascinating end to an awesome series.
B005COO1X6|5.0|As with his other writings Stephen King is one of my favorite authors--the only problem with Mile 81 is that it ends just as I really got into it--should be developed into a longer writing.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Highly recomended. Why is a written review required to submit a review on amaxon? Very lame and annoying  .  One
B004HD61KE|5.0|The Devil Colony has lots of action and a lot of mysteries which eventually get solved. I recommend it as an entertaining read.
B007HACDLK|4.0|It's everything you've come to expect from a Mitch Rapp  book. Well written, fast pace with all your favorite Characters.  Stan Hurley could fill a several books by himself but Rapp is the bees knees. The ultimate spook and ruthless killer.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had my doubts about these books, but the more I read them, the better they got.<br />I would recommend them to anyone who likes a good love story.<br />Christian Grey is definetly one knowledgeable guy.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|This app is great!  I love the jazz selection.  It plays very well on my Kindle with clear sound.  No problems.  I haven't heard anything that I don't like, even with the large selection available. This has been so nice to have and I'm so glad I found it.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|Such an amazing move, great cast...<br /><br />Was sceptical about the movie, didn't think that it would do the play (or book) justice, but never been happier to be wrong, went with the whole family (my parents and sisters, and all of us had only good things to say...<br /><br />make sure you have a tissue or kleenex, even my old man was crying (which never happens)
B0098VXDDS|5.0|Just what I expected from Vengeance.  Excitement, suspense, bloodshed.  They do a great job with the show and can't wait for this seasons episodes.
034580404X|3.0|This series of book is not worthy of the hype. This series goes off of shock value rather than actual plot.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|Although there was no problem streaming the movie the quality of the movie was below par.  Do not rent or buy.  It is not worth it regardless of her popularity in the theaters now.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Once in a while a movie comes along that touches you in ways that you didn't think possible. I just finished watching The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I am in a state of awe by how much this movie moved me. This story is so beautifully written, and was tugging on my heart strings for each and every character of this movie. This movie is now one of my all time favorites. I really wish I would of read the book first.
B00A77II0U|5.0|One of the best HO games I've played.  Just enough challenge to be fun...not too easy; not too hard.  Great graphics.
1416589473|3.0|While not a literary masterpiece in any sense of the term, this was a short but enjoyable excursion into the world of Tyria. As a standalone fantasy novel, I'm afraid it would fall rather flat, but as an excursion into the gaming world of Guild Wars it was a fun read. I would have given it four stars (I reserve 5 for the reads I find truly amazing), but there were several gaffs and issues with the novel that merit a lower score.<br /><br />The first of these is Dougal, the main character, suddenly changing his mind about actually going on the adventure. There is an attempt to explain his change of heart, but it seemed quick and unrealistic or contrived. The other issues are just mix-ups in the name of the cities were certain events take place in the novel itself, and minor character/plot inconsistencies. The characters are also rather flat, but still manage to be endearing and enjoyable. After all, they served as an introduction to the varying races of Guild Wars 2 and didn't really require much personal development. As happens so often with authors writing a novel set in an existing IP, however, a significant portion comes across as an effort to prove how knowledgeable they are with said IP. This is especially evident during descriptions of Divinity's Reach and Lion's Arch, the latter's destruction being mentioned in detail on more than one occasion, both of which not really adding to anything you could see on your own in-game anyway.<br /><br />Still, as a simple \\"band-of-adventurers\\" novel based in a video game world, it was an enjoyable read. The back story, tie-ins, and material that fills in the gaps between the original game and Guild Wars 2 was equally enjoyable. I would certainly recommend this novel, so long as expectations are tempered appropriately.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|This book is well-written and much more interesting than I would have originally thought. Brooks has a way of bringing you into the reality of a zombie apocalypse.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|i really enjoy this show. it is intelligent without being condescending. all the characters are great for what they bring to the show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever. Never stop playing it. Love it. Cool items, hoverboards, characters, upgrades, and offers. Best coin prices. AWESOME!!!!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|great show. lots of character growth. no favorites played. the writers are unconcerned about who they kill off and i think that is a great angle.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|The book was ok it kept me somewhat entertained but was nothing like the movie that we all know and love

Even though the story is heartbreaking, it has its moments of great friendships, strong family connection & sweep you off your feet young LOVE! Holder in this story has maturity above his years. Most young LOVES, Will never have that selfless love. The author made WONDERFUL LOVE Story out of a horrible life story. Will be reading other books by this author.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good, twisted love story. You will have  a hard time putting this book down. Lots  of twists and turns that will keep you guessing.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was able to capture all of the emotions that the book did when I read it as a teenager. It does a wonderful job of including the important moments of the book while being selective enough not to make the movie drag on for three hours. It was exactly what a film version of a book should be. The casting was excellent and you can tell that the author played a large part in the film. I'm glad they took their time with it--it was well worth the wait.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I rented this and watched it on my Kindle Fire. I give the movie two thumbs up. It was very funny. I would definately watch it again.
1616550414|5.0|When this book was announced for a US release I was very excited. When it arrived in the mail I was just blown away. An excellent book that details the history of the Legend Of Zelda series. Plenty of content throughout the years with interesting tidbits as well. From beginning to end it's informative and a nostalgia trip. Whether you want to see the official timeline or are interested in concept art, international boxart and names, whatever, this book has it covered. What a great way to extend the celebration of 25 years of Zelda. At the current price this is a steal. I highly recommend this book to any fan of Zelda or video games in general.

B009VMN3RA|3.0|Child abuse in any form should be punishable with the most stringent of sanctions and the children should be mandatorily given mental help to guide them through the painful process and aftermath.<br />There is no dispute as to how heinous such a crime can be - the mental/ verbal/ physical abuse of a youngster .  I am not well-versed in the healing process that is necessary for the victim to be able to resign themselves to the past without letting it condemn their present and future existence.  But, of one thing I am certain:  publishing a book about it can hardly be considered a cure-all or even a bandage for the pain that was endured.<br />So it is with some sense of confusion that I look at the published tomes by Hollywood's children and struggle to understand what sense of appeasement can be derived by revealing to the world the sins of omission committed by their parents.<br />Cheryl Crawford started the ball rolling in MOMMIE DEAREST.  It became a media sensation that was quickly reduced to a camp film classic and finally was doubted and somewhat refuted as to its accuracy by the author herself.<br />Next came BD Hyman and MY MOTHER'S KEEPER.  Joan Crawford's rival, Bette Davis, was in for it when Bette's only child wrote a scathing tell-all.  Immediately dismissed by sundry folks (including Bette's ex-husband Gary Merrill who published a message in many journals saying \\"She Did It For The Money\\"), the only gratification that might have come to either Ms. Hyman or Crawford had to be monetary (Christina Crawford reaped profits from not only the book but the subsequent movie and a 25th anniversary edition of the tome).<br />Sachi Parker is a polite, well-bred woman who writes in a classy way.  Her descriptions of Japan or New Zealand are of particular interest and there are many times that a reader might wish that she had written a prosaic travel log as opposed to an expose about her parents. Her honest retelling of scenes from her life - cold, stark, brutal - could be used as a lesson to many an adolescent.  Her remarkably abilities to weather a storm and survive - even at the tender age of 17 - makes her an endearing heroine and a self-contained person - ironically, something her mother has long fought for in this world.<br />But when she leaves the details of growing up in LA and Japan (and her time spent in boarding schools), the story grows too dark and immediately falls apart as it becomes questionable.<br />There is not much doubt that her mother, actress Shirley MacLaine, was an absentee parent.  No one can possibly stay on top of her game for over 50 years and manage to be perfect in all areas - performer, activist, mother.  No, there is no excuse for her lack of parental concern or maternal care for her only child just as Ms. Parker's father - Steve Parker - had no excuse for the tasteless, bad examples he continually displayed while he was caring for Sachi.  Page after page of tawdry examples made me want to scream at the Parker parents and saying, \\"What is wrong with you?\\" Both Ms. MacLaine and Mr. Parker were worldly people who managed to provide, quite well, for themselves so how could they be so lax in the raising of a child?<br />But in retelling the story from her point of view, Sachi Parker seems to wrap her memories with more mysteries than answers.  Plane tickets mysteriously disappearing and then reappearing (the same with retainers); love letters found between step-mothers and fianc&eacute;s (almost out of a soap opera) - all are noted but none are explored or, ultimately, explained to the reader.<br />Ms. Parker sounds like a lovely person who suffered cruel knocks in her early days but retelling some of the tales about both her mother and father do not lead the reader, or ultimately herself, into any clear idea as to why these happened or how they can be prevented for future victims. Further, as harrowing as her tale is, the vagaries outweigh the probabilities and she ends up discrediting herself. One feels sorry for the woman but her troubles are those that should be taken care of in private - not as a public hanging of her own mother.  Any good deeds she wants to do should be done to help others who are being abused and writing about a 70+ year old lady is hardly going to help anyone.s sorry for the woman but her troubles are those that should be taken care of in private - not as a public hanging of her own mother.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book In my opinion is a really good book and I think that It really Inspires kids who might be somewhat like August and also for kids who are not. This is the best book I have read so far and good job to the writer!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I kept hearing about Wool but had no clue what it was about or if the author was any good. The series is excellent and the author is a very good writer.<br /><br />Very fast but measured pace as it reads like short stories that are interconnected, but is a nicely done novel. I have had a hard time putting my Kindle down.<br /><br />I haven't finished the series yet, but already know this is on my list of top science-fiction stories.<br /><br />** Edit: I've finished the series and give it high marks for a great sci-fi series and interesting take on human psychology. It's definitely worth reading each book -- and I look forward to the upcoming movie. Great job, Mr Howey.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I love playing the game and sometimes on I find myself playing for hours. A great game to play and test your skills.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|It was a really good representation of the show, I thought very highly of this season. Most definitely worth the purchase!
B0091X4HQA|5.0|I don't usually like talky movies with little action, but I thought that the story and acting were great in this.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Really great Batman movie especially for the price/ value. Superhero fans will be extremely pleased and not have many objections
B005IQ39AY|3.0|There were some bugs that caused the game to end after I've cleared all the bubbles without moving on to the next level.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Will make you change the way you live life. Perfect for sports and non-sports lovers alike. Please take the chance on this movie.
B004J00KJ8|5.0|I never tire of this movie. It's a great movie to have on while you're cooking.  No matter how many times I have watched this movie, I never ever tire of it.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I love love love gilmore girls. Possibly my second favorite tv show ever. Really great season too so don;t hesitate to buy it!
B008L1DNGI|4.0|If you've played this game at any point in the last fifteen-odd years it's been out, you already know what to expect. It's a charming and enjoyable puzzle game, where you use a limited series of actions per puzzle to guide one or more mice to safety. It eases you into gameplay smoothly, and the difficulty ramps up nicely.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|The greatest himym season ever. Everyone will enjoy this, even those that don't usually like the show. Includes the Ducky Tie episode!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very enjoyable game for my kindle fire hd. Enjoy the graphics and challenges but the game will take time because I refuse to spend money on items. But that is just me. You decide if it is worth your hard earned cash. But from someone who has looked for quality horse games for years this is fun.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Spoiler alert! This movie is not about an airplane crash, although one takes place early on in the film. Flight is about the extraordinary pilot who, despite being very drunk, performs a crash landing that saves nearly all onboard. I found the character as written to be real--I have known \\"functioning alcoholics\\", and nothing here seems exagerrated. Denzel Washington plays this guy perfectly. The story explores the character's flight from truth--his failure as a husband and father, his failure to acknowledge his addiction, his failure to live with any sense of integrity. Stories about alcoholism and addiction are hard to watch, especially if the character has great talent. This one approaches classic Greek tragedy. Is Washington's pilot a hero? Yes, but, without giving any more of the plot away, his heroism has nothing to do with flying an airplane. Flight is Zemeckis' most adult film to date, a film about grownups to be viewed by grownups. When you consider his body of work (Roger Rabbit, Back to the Future, Romancing the Stone, Forest Gump, Contact, Cast Away...all good, some great), this film is a pretty significant departure. I think it is also the best thing he has done.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wonderful  characters in a small Oxfordshire Township and village, centered around the local postmistress.  Had to keep watching as I grew fond of the various people.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|This is probably the biggest disappointment I've had with a huge budget sci-fi/action film.  They do practically nothing to build the characters' personalities, and then the rest of the movie is them running and fighting.  It's well shot, the acting isn't horrible, the faces/bodies are beautiful, and the special effects are spectacular.  But because I didn't feel attached any of these characters, I was bored after the first ten minutes.  It felt like a chore to finish it, but was hoping it would get better.  I love sci-fi and action films as much as the next person, but please provide some decent character development!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've completed season 1 and have started into season 2.<br /><br />Downton Abbey is consistently enjoyable.  Each episode seems to be as good as the previous one.<br /><br />By the way, check out the CBS show on the real Downton Abbey on Youtube.com.  Fascinating.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put this down. It moved quickly, was an easy read and held my interest.  It's a real \\"feel good\\" book.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This movie has some great stars.  The story is about some British retirees who can't afford to retire at home.<br />They start an adventure when they decide to retire to India.  Makes you smile.<br />It also makes a great point about happiness being a choice.
B0091QS88K|5.0|My six year old really likes this game.  Makes the little ones have to think a little bit with the recipes.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Ho Hum. Grisham has done alot better. The Racketeer's story falls short of Grisham's best but it is entertaining. Try it, you may like it.
B009G78EE2|4.0|I bought the album for just for the song that is popular right now, but found that I liked the whole album.  Poetic and fun at the same time.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Search for Sugarman is an incredible true story. It is a great example of truth being stranger than fiction. Inspirational for sure.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This is an awesome app for on the go projects or for work can't wait for more updates. I use this app daily never lets me down.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|Classic movie...I can watch this over and over and never get tired!  I love Amazon's Instant Movies...much better selection than Netflix.
B00886XQO0|3.0|Lets start with the packaging. When someone spends $300 on a unnecessary item it is best to try and impress them early. The packaging that this headset comes in is unimpressive. It is thrown into a cheap cardboard box with a COD: BO2 logo on the side. This is very disappointing since the previous years version got a fairly cool hard plastic pelican box looking case to transport in. Overall I am super unimpressed as with the packaging and look of this product especially considering the downgrade from last year.<br /><br />  Next is the sound. I find the sound to be good-to-very good. Again not $300 good but good none the less. To give you some context I am mostly comparing the sound of this headset to the first gen. around ear Bose headphones that I used before purchasing this headset. I really liked the sound from those headphones and in some cases like the Bose headphones more. The turtle beach headset can get really loud which is a good thing but i find that a lot of times the other sounds the game is trying to send to the player are drowned out in the excessive bass that is produced by this headset. Even in the \\"footsteps\\" preset which is supposed to magnify the sound of surrounding footsteps I found myself immersed and lost in the sound from grenades and planes dropping bombs. The sound quality is good though, but again not super impressive.<br /><br />  Now onto the presets and \\"features\\" I have read other reviews and agree with them on the usefulness of the features of this headset. Yes turtle beach has a long list of extras that this headset can do, but rarely if ever did I use the other presets. I found myself picking the main preset for the chat sounds, and the main preset for the game sounds, all of the other extras are not nice and don't really add functionality to the headset. The Bluetooth pairing works great, but for $300 it had better work. I also found that often times my transmitting station wouldn't activate the Dolby sound to my headphones unlessI got up and pressed the button on the transmitter, that is really annoying.<br /><br />  Finally the price/value. As I have said before this item is not a necessity and I realize that. I just don't see the value for the price. This review would have taken on a whole different tone if I had paid $180 or even $225. That is where I feel the price would justify the product, but not $300. Especially with the lack luster effort put in to impress the consumer. Yes the headset is nice and cool but it just not worth the cost.
0761119752|5.0|My grandsons love this book.  My son told me that they really love to have this read to them at bedtime.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It.  Keeps you thinking but so relaxing!!! I love playing this game. It keeps your brain very active and alive.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because it keeps you ocupide. it is great for little kids and my nieces and nephews playbit all the time when they come over
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Zooey Deschanel is adorable as the woman who does't believe in love until she finds it, and Joseph Gordon-Leavitt takes you right back to those lovestruck, lovesick days we've all had. Great music (especially the scene with Hall and Oates &#34;You Make My Dreams Come True) and a flashback approach that underlines the ups and downs of a relationship.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is just FUN!  It is the type of game that all ages can play from easy to hard.
B005HEPL8K|5.0|I'm a fan of ST:TNG, and of Star Trek in general, but navigating through DVD menus is a hassle when all I really wanna do is just watch the show.  Amazon presents the series very well.
B00197X1UO|5.0|Stand-alone album review here. The only reason to weigh this against Loveless would be if it came after, and one wanted to know if they remained inspired, but it did not come after.  I am not going to say it's better or worse. It was a different point in MBV's musical evolution. So here it goes:<br /><br />Unlike most of the other bands of that time and similar genre, MBV did not seem to be trying too hard to be different or avant garde. Many guitar/noise/etc. rock bands from the 80's come off as pretentious and gimmicky to me. Sonic Youth is one example of this. If you don't like Sonic Youth, that's okay. You might like this album.<br /><br />On the note of liking this album, one might not like it right away. It took me quite a while, actually. If you go into it in the mindset of relating it to other 80's noise rock, or to Loveless from '91, you might miss what's going on in it. It might also be easier to understand it if you play music, but I can't say, as my perspective has changed from that for a long time. The point I am getting at is this:<br /><br />This album is full of great (often subdued) melodies. They also have a great dynamic in many songs of building tension and releasing it. The lyrics are pretty good. They are often generic enough to allow you to place your own sentiments with them. I feel like MBV has always excelled at making the music listening experience intimate for each individual.<br /><br />If you don't completely hate this album, keep it around. One day, as it has for many of us, it might dawn on you what is special about this album. You can tell how much music means to MBV/Kevin Shields. They may have put out a few rushed EPs from when their record label was getting impatient waiting for Loveless, but MBV would never make a full-length album that fails to be special and genuine.<br /><br />I believe this, Loveless, and the new album m b v, are all some of the best albums ever made. Not just because I love them, but because they're all great pieces that were made for the right reasons.
