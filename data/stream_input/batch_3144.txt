B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Really fun game app! I wish it was easier to get more lives or unlock next phases. I wish the cap on lives was higher than just 5. But I can't stop playing it!!!
B000022TSH|5.0|Excellent crime noire with jack Nicholson at his best. This is a DVD fav! Everyone should have  Two jakes also is worth the watch
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I love this movie! I've watched it many times over the years and it is always a good time. It was such a nice surprise to see it on Amazon Prime. It's a weird, funny Tim Burton directed film starring a very young Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. Catherine O'Hara is really wonderful and  Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice is so very good! My kids loved it when we saw it years ago. It's one of those movies you will go back to again and again.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I can't believe the ending...I see a lot is going to happen to Sansa,  Jon Snow and, Tyrion...can't wait to read the next book
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I'm having.  Great time! Building my kingdom is a great way to waist time....I really like selling stuff at the sea port and in the markets
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is a great the graphics are bad to the bone. best one yet. Deer Hunter is one of a kind.
B00AXVHHTI|5.0|Great show, but I can't figure out how the British call Americans rude. These ppl are rude even when they're trying to be nice.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|This is an easy game for anyone to pick up and it's quite addictive. It's my favorite game to introduce friends to the board game scene.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super game. Fun with a friend.I'm always satisfied with almost every thing I buy.and never a problem with returns. Amazon prime is way cool.saved do much money.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love it, it's a fun game I've been playing for along time and it's a grate game for kids to your little girl or girls will like it too try it and you'll see.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is no better show. Keeps me in suspense and on the edge of my seat. They are not shy in killing off main characters.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is the tragic tale of Charlie Gordon, a retarded man who longs and tries so hard to be smart, who becomes an off-the-scale-genius, and who slides back down to longing to be smart again. I love seeing that the second time around, at least, his “friends” in his beloved bakery look out for him instead of laughing at him and abusing him. Thank goodness author Daniel Keyes let his wonderful character find at least this small happiness at the end of his quest to learn who he is and how he fits in to a flawed society. I think I’ve read and sobbed through this brilliant book at least ten times. To my mind, it still scores ten on a scale of one to five.
B0047VSW30|4.0|A completely enjoyable movie that transported me back to a period of ancient history I knew nothing about.  It follows the life of a Greek philosopher, astronomer and mathematican named Hypatia played extremely well by Rachel Weisz.  The story takes place in the city of Alexandria in Egypt and has a great deal to do with the emergence of Christianity and the Christians persecution of the pagan religions.  From what I’ve read by people who know more than I do about the 4th century A.D., the movie is a bit heavy handed when it comes to the Christians, who appear more like modern day Taliban, and it seems the Library of Alexandria and lighthouse were already destroyed.  As I was ignorant of those facts, I found Hypatia’s story interesting and the depiction of Alexandria quite fascinating.  I don't know if the director of the film had an agenda to put down Christianity and don't care if he did.  If he was making the point that fundamentalist religions, both Muslim and Christian, have a bad habit of treating women like second class citizens and persecuting them when they threaten the supremacy of men, it's a point well worth making.
1594202273|4.0|A fresh and thorough reminder for those non-baby boomers (or those of us on the cusp) of the awesome power and responsibility innate to nuclear weapons.  Readers should digest the facts, science and history of these developments for comparision to modern global nuclear issues.
B00CUG8GAS|2.0|I tried and tried to like this book but found it boring.  The descriptions were sophomoric seeming like an attempt to make thorough use of a thesaurus without giving a feel for what was really going on.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert surprised me with this novel.  It was rich with detail, again about the wandering women, seeking more than the life and role that she was born too.  The theme was a bit Jane Austenesque which is always delightful to discover.  Her research of Botanicals, lifestyle, travel, social moray's of the period and the history surrounding the story played out beautifully to support the plot.  I think we can expect the unexpected from the author judging from this novel.  I found some of the sexually explicit scenes stood out as a bit gratuitous and if the novelist had decided to write an erotic novel from stem to stern, then okay....yet I'm not sure it developed the main characters motivation enough to include such a departure in description from the rest of the book.  Will I be turning to those pages later on to &#34;review&#34;?Not really.  They just made me uncomfortable.  From Captain Cook, to Kew Gardens, to trans continental journeys, sailing ships and love.  Good plain fun.  I have to say she is obviously brilliant and it plays out a little in the prose, in that we know the author may very well be the protagonist herself.  There's a little bit of her ego in this novel, which from Ms Gilbert is to be expected.  Still I found it brilliant, irreverent, adventurous.  I've already recommended it to friends.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Good price fast delivery.  Bought it for the grand kids they really love the original Monsters Inc and were looking forwar to the sequel.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tans' latest was well worth waiting 8 years for.  If a journey is what you are looking for, you will receive just that.  From the courtesan houses of Shanghai at the turn of the century, to San Francisco, to far outposts in China, it's all here.  The story is rich in the differences and the similarities between women of different cultures and mixed cultures.  A real tome that tips its' hat to todays' globalism from the women who broken that ground for us.  Rich with physical and emotional detail the characters illicit sympathy, camaraderie and amazement at how they move through life's trials toward what is, yes, a bit of an expected - yet welcome conclusion.  No one tells the mother-daughter story than Ms. Tan illustrating the misunderstanding, love and ultimate devotion that we all experience.  This one should certainly be made into a film.  I love an historical novel at all times, though this was the best of times.  Highly recommended by this avid reader.
B00CHVJODE|5.0|Good price and fast delivery.  Very interesting story line.  The kids seemed to enjoy it and also my wife and I found it to be very interesting, it was one of those movies that took a long time to be released to the public I was waiting for it for quite a while.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game.... works great on kindle fire hd. Good graphics. You do not have to have facebook to play but it makes it easier!
B00G32OER4|1.0|??? Poor excuse for a scary movie. Based on true story? So what, still not scared. Oh acting ok, special effects minimal, plot?  Lean.  If you want scary \\"The Exorcist\\".
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game. It's fun and addictive.  I wish I got more lives during play before I have to pay money. I like the challenge.
1881273156|5.0|Nice book with great insigts and solid advice on how to lead a great marriage and life with that special lady in our lives as men of God. Unfortunately my pastor called it a &#34;Chick Book&#34; in other words he deems it only for women. His name is Senior Pastor and Dr. James MacDonald, of Harvest Bible Chapel, Rowling Meadows, Illinois.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Best read I have had in a long time. Glad to find a new author.
B003DNN0L2|4.0|My kids love the songs in this movie (okay, they are adult kids - but they STILL love it).  Very entertaining.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I usually don't play these type games...but it was awesome from the beginning.  I'm going to be a fan of this game for some time to come.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|No customer support help for questions asked. You have to figure it all out yourself. Or hope another player knows what to tell you to help you. A lot if tech issues are cropping up in all the games according to the player feed back I've read. So many people upset with zynga and zynga is refusing to respond to anyone.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|A great story that is felt- not told- through the music. Brilliantly written, with great use of character representation by instruments.
0992251656|5.0|good quality game pieces with clear instructions, looking forward to adding this to the game night rotation, Get a s***, get a job, keep flyin
0061992860|5.0|Good information contained withing these pages, not too complicated or too overly simplified, and compact enough to keep in a backpack or rucksack to take with you... y'know, just in case.
B00ADYYY50|3.0|Loved &#34;Rolling Papers&#34; but, unfortunately this album was just not nearly as good. There isn't one track that sticks with you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. It was an easy, fun read. It keeps you hooked from start to finish. Enjoy!
B0064W639K|5.0|Fantastic story, interesting characters and art, and good writing. Classic graphic novel well worth your time. I would highly recommend it.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Based on true events. This tells what war is about. Excellent story about brotherhood in the military and war. Highly recommended.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a masterfully written saga of everyday like!  Should be a required read for all Juniors and Seniors in High School with a good dose of deep discussion.
B00GHJ1S2M|2.0|This album is not Terrible in any way, but it is the least exciting out of all of her so far! I really have loved all the ones prior. This is the problem, amazon mp3 (which is SO much better than iTunes) has it for 5 dollars... and there are 4 or 5 songs that are really worth having, so it is better to have the album for the few extra cents than get them all separately...
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an interesting sequel to the &#34;Hunger Games.&#34; It is a breathtaking novel! It totally left me speechless by the time I finished it. I surely recommend it to anyone.
B00E3I3KDE|5.0|Great Music, and so nice to get it all on one set, She is great and I hope we get more from her soon!
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great movie,great acting and the story is so moving, sad and inspirational. I really didn't know anything about this movie other than it was about a plane crash and pilot.
B00BN2NQFU|5.0|What an awesome Film, It is definitely for the Artistic mind! Love it Love it Love it! If this does not make you happy and motivate you than I dont know what to do with you!?
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game so much !!!!!!!  It's so fun!!!  The only thing I do not like is how you can not search friends but any other then that I love the game
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a wonderful series. Suzanne Collins continues to engage her readers with quality fiction. I am anxious to see how the movie stacks up to this second book in the series.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|cool game but get's hard as you progress download this game if you like smashin bots. rad game get it
B003XVYLDU|4.0|An interesting story...in places! Slightly disjointed, which I suppose is intentional. Not light reading. Requires serious concentration. I would read more by this author.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It's the worst book ever :p. Are you guys on drugs or alcoholics or in farting contests or something.<br />:-(
B0000TZ7EA|1.0|Doesn't work on USA players not happy I liked to have watched my movie u need to say for what country's or seats it works for in the CD players.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|Nice simple cover that protects the screen and tablet when not in use. This is a soft cover, so I'm sure if I dropped it, the unit may be damaged, but what I wanted was something that would protect my Kindle Fire HDX while I transported it here and there. This does the trip and I'm satisfied.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|I finally found the original film in BLACK and WHITE the way it was meant to be seen. Don't mess with a classic.
1401940676|5.0|I have read/listened to a number of NDE's, but this one is by far the best. Her experience was far greater than any person I have read about. Her open mindedness regarding the religious aspect was also very refreshing. I will listen to this again.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Loved this game much better playing it on my kindle. It plays a lot faster. Just wish you could get more storage space. When you upgrade its only 10 extra items to store.
0736092269|5.0|Incredible detail for every muscle group and exercise imaginable. The photos are very graphical and explain every muscle affected by a weight lifting exercise.
0316055433|4.0|Love this long and gripping novel. Unfortunately my copy (hardcover, purchased from amazon, Little Brown publisher) was defective and when I reached p. 746, it suddenly stopped and repeated about 20 earlier pages. Major bummer as I was just eagerly approaching the promising conclusion.<br /><br />Wondering how many other defective copies are in circulation? Whether publisher or amazon is going to do anything about them?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought it on Sunday, arrived Monday.  Took about 5 minutes to set up.  Too easy to use.  Works exactly as advertised.  Just bought  a second one for another room in the house.<br />Quick Update.  I decided to try \\"Tab Casting\\" Amazon Prime through a tab in Google Chrome with my laptop.  Worked like a champ, you just need to play via flash and not Silver Light.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Very powerful, and very compact.  Built in micro USB cable is a huge advantage (though it easily accepts any USB cable for charging.  Happily recharges my Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD several times on a single charge, while also keeping my related devices (Parrot Zik headphones, Jawbone Icon headset, etc.) topped off.  I also like that the battery is very close in size to my phone, so it is very comfortable to hold both (stacked), permitting me to comfortably watch videos or surf the web while my phone is being recharged.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire is one of those books that has so much emotion, detail, and keeps you glued. Suzanne Collins definitely got every thing that will keep you on edge, and her creativity is extraordinary. I was a little unsure If I was going to be an author, but Suzanne persuaded me to pursue this dream. I hope one day, you will see my book written, and I will day that Suzanne has helped me in this fantasy.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.<br />If you are a fan of anything Joss Whedon has ever done<br />or a Nathan Fillion fan<br /><br />this is a MUST see
B00FAIPDAE|3.0|I chose this rating because at first the game was fun, then as I start playing it even more i fidn that upgrades on buildings are already a day even only upgrading to level 2, which is too long for just want to do a quick check every now and then.
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|I like most of the songs, but some are very repetitive in lyrics and too long.  This album is OK with a few good songs.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Incredibly large story, both in physical size and story depth.  Great characters, good twists.  Downloading the next in series immediately.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I wish you could have more lives with out paying for them! I think it would make the game more entertaining and more people would play.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Although maybe not as curious as &#34;Blink&#34;, &#34;David & Goliath&#34; is certainly a thought provoking trip into some new territory. The very mention of dyslexia as an advantage was reason enough to buy for me. I would definitely follow up with some of his citations as this presents a more whole and academic argument, in my opinion. Overall, another insightful and ambitious book to add to his body of work.
B004UID2LC|5.0|99% of videos can be downloaded, just a few not (due to restrictions on youtube). but you can download videos o or just the mp3 version (only music of the video), thats perfect for school performances, etc.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. It's addictive. Can't stop playing. Good to keep the kids busy too and keep the old noodle pumping.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|These are good headphones and, for the price, very good.  But I would hardly rave about them, as many of the other reviews have.  They're a little clunky, and they could have been designed better.  Overall, though, I give them a thumbs-up.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am so glad Amazon had these for me to view since I missed all 3 seasons.  Love to curl up on the couch and watch a few shows at a time.  Love the show.
B0085KGHI6|2.0|Received I cd and 1 dvd which I assume should be used together,<br />Assume the briefness of cd was supposed to be made up by dvd.<br />It was an impromptu jam session and not worth the price.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I love listening to Amy Winehouse.  There is something about the quality of her singing and the expressive way she delivers a song that evokes the 1940 singers, but with a thoroughly modern tilt.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Read this in the bookstore, and liked it so much I actually purchased it.  (Which isn't how these things normally happen in real life.  My years of using that excuse are now totally justified).  Beyond that, I can't do more justice to the review than has already been done by the leading helpful review by TChris titled Powerful, intelligent, and surprising October 1, 2013.  http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JLN4U3N04S1S/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAXFDLM&nodeID=133140011&store=digital-text
B000JLPMPS|5.0|This is probably the best western of the past 40 years.  Dark and vicious, and that's the good guy, the sheriff.  Also has moments of humor as the characters comment on the task of killing a cowboy who cut up a prostitute.  Gene Hackman as the take no prisoners sheriff is masterful at making the laughing sheriff seem full of malice.  Eastwood at the end is both good and evil in the extreme as he exits the town.  A truly great film.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It's a good little game. You don't have to spend a dime, unless you have no patience and don't like to wait for your experience to go up
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I started this book within one hour after finishing the first book in the series.  This book continues page turning quickly.  I loved it, but found myself getting upset with Eva, but she she changes pace at the end.  Great read if you like the first one in series.  Starting next book soon.  You won't be disappointed.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like using ebay, and it makes buying easy.  There are loads, of things to hunt and seek.  My latest purchases, were easy, and I am looking forward to using the items I bought.
B00DMKFN34|3.0|the only movie my g-boys didnt sit through awed... they paused a few times to eat and or to play... that tells me something...
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I don't do a whole lot on Facebook, because, of the problems, of keeping things safe, so I do just simple notes, that keeps me up, with the ones I know.  I hope, the future, there will better standards, for keeping one's writings, safe.......
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I am a longtime vet of the pc and 360 versions of the game.  This version most resembles the 360 version.  Either way, it is a steal at $5.  Terraria would be a steal at $500 honestly.  The amount of gameplay packed inside is astounding!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Ordered it. Arrived quickly. Have spent hours trying to get it to work. It should be plug and play. Everything else in my network is plug and play, just might have to add a password. I can't get the Chromecast to work. Waste of $35.  Update: My co-worker tried it on his network and it worked fine. So, I sold it to him.  I still like Google for searching, but doubt I will buy any more of their products.
0345803485|5.0|Good book.  Be ready for surprises and things you are not used to reading.  Definitely x rated.  Read all three.  Shipped quickly, no damage.
B00FEFOKAM|2.0|I don't have this exact set but I do have the dual set they put out awhile ago. Let me tell you. If you want to hear Sinatra at his best this is not it. Go get the Capitol collection or hisReprise years.  Sinatra is at his best when he sings by himself with his handpicked arrangers.  Just saying......
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The new cable works good with my Kindle Fire and it is charging up now with no problems.  Thank you.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|As a fan of Eggers, I have mixed feelings on this text.  There are things about it that are great, and there are things about it that I find not so great.  Strangely, I feel as though the goods and the bads sort of contradict one another, and the end result is a really great book whose existence is a mirror of the big issues that are addressed and then stumbles over itself with the way they are presented.<br /><br />First, I really dislike the length of the book.  It is incredibly long, and this results in a clunky execution.  I also disliked some of the plot points that were contrived and really could be guessed in the first twenty-five pages.  Some of the elements of the book that also remain unsatisfying is the constant cataloging of information that the audience is constantly bombarded with for pages, when really the elementary idea of the book could have been quite clear the first time, or the first two times, or any of the times really.<br /><br />And don't we expect more of Eggers?<br /><br />Here is where my review is contradictory, though.  I propose that these gimmicky, strung out, boring, numerical, and way-too-long elements are exactly what he had in mind when building the data-overloaded, too-much-information, and contrived relationships of this book.  It is too long because big data is too much.  There are so many numbers because the astronomical amount of data in the world is just increasing and unmanageable.  The plot and elements of what happens are contrived because we have become contrived and ineffective in our relationships, and isn't the experience with a text as intimate as it gets?<br /><br />When you reach the last 20 pages of book two, and everything happens that you were expecting to happen, and then Eggers plots in some insanely tacky elemental closure to the piece, the realization comes that the length, corny plot twists, and reams of fabricated data all serve to blatantly point out where we are headed in society, education, war, politics, and even the most mundane of moral and ethical expectations of one another.  This book succeeds in doing this incredibly well, and some of the statements he makes in one sentence tend to outweigh the last hundred pages of prose you just read...<br /><br />Unfortunately, while I see it as a great book that succeeds in everything it was attempting to accomplish, I just didn't like it because I felt that it was almost hitting me over the head...  And I expect more of Eggers in many ways.  If he could have done the same in less than fifty thousand words, I would have been very impressed.s, and even the most mundane of moral and ethical expectations of one another.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A mystery inside a puzzle wrapped in an enigma. This game is visually beautiful and fascinating. For anyone that likes brain teasers, mysteries and a touch of the gothic. I am not really into gaming, but I think that this game would appeal to more experienced gamers and people who aren't,t regular game players.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I thought I had read every entry of her blog. Turns out, I hadn't. This is basically a compilation of the best blog entries she's ever posted. So freakin hilarious.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I am so happy there is a YouTube app because  for a while there wasn't one through Amazon for kindle. .it has been working well for me so far. Some of the tabs and other features like custom video playlists are not available. But I'm still happy ! The video quality is good and the videos run smoothly
B008EL25LE|5.0|Great game!<br />The app itself does what it is supposed to! Works very well on my Samsung Galaxy II<br />Thanks Amazon for &#34;Free App Everyday !!!
B00319KS7C|4.0|Good work by Matt. Great story about how, what seemed like a person looking to live the American dream, gets derailed. By what you may ask, what else greed and the need to win at all costs. Sad but true. Really a true story.

B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Wanted to play this really bad so I downloaded it and everything was going on until I went to play my first game it loaded up until I got to the play screen it said it was waiting on the players which I could see but then it would kick me out of the game saying I took too long to play.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I have been using this headset for gaming for almost a month now and I am overall very happy. It does start to feel a little uncomfortable after long periods of time but that is to be expected on some scale. Great sound quality and excellent battery life. Well worth it to me.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|Too bloody, too vicious. If one likes to see skin human bodies thrown from a skyscraper, or what a bomb and bullets do to a body in slow motion, maybe this movie is for you.  The carnage was horribly realistic.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|This author truly understands the middle aged male.  It is an honest portrayal of an experience.  This is my second book by Jonathan Tropper.  I plan to continue to read all his books.  Shared them with my husband who really likes Mr. Tropper's writing as well.  We both however would like to see a continuation of the Book of Joe.
B0030MTQNW|3.0|Good movie for historic interest.  A bit on the cheesy-side for some of the acting and dramatic music.  Thinking that's just a sign of the times in which it was created.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a new reader at 62.  Two years ago I bought a Kindle and the ease of it has opened up a whole new world for me.  I've never been much of a reader but kept up with current events, magazine articles, etc.  After trying many different genres of literature I keep coming back to science fiction stories.  I usually read the reviews first on Amazon before I decide to purchase a book.  Nobody I know has read this book, but this book was highly recommended by readers on Amazon and it intrigued me to want to read it too.  Wool Omnibus started off a little different because I wasn't sure of what was going on.  It wasn't long before I was wrapped up in the mystery and found more time to read this great story.  I enjoyed the way Mr. Howey put words together and made me able to see who the people are and what is going on.  There was no mystery to the details and the story flowed along nicely.  I loved the way the chapter would end that prompted me to think about it until the next time I picked up my Kindle.  Thank you Mr. Howey for writing such a brilliant story!  I've bought Shift and look forward to starting that one today.  I plan to promote this novel to people that I know who love reading this type of story.
B001BANK32|5.0|I read this book because of Dr sleep.  Now I'm ready to start the new adventure of Danny and see the shining has in store.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I loved the Wizard of OZ from the first time I saw it. This did it justice. It was very entertaining.<br />James Franco was brilliant as usual, The women did great jobs also.
B006588YUE|4.0|This cooler worked just fine for a LGA2011 processor. Like other reviews the chip is bigger than the contact on the cooler. The plastic piece that protects the thermal compound came loose in shipping and some of the compound smeared which I believe is bad packaging on Intel's part. The fan makes little noise and the heatsink seems to do a decent job at cooling the chip.<br /><br />Pros<br />Cheap<br />Not noisy<br />Easy to install<br />Cools decently<br />Nice little blue light when the computer is on.<br /><br />Cons<br />Plastic peice to keep thermal compound safe came loose<br />Not a lot of pictures of the product on the page
B0094LT5ZM|5.0|I love guys with powers. They are so sexy. This movie has a good plot with the Five founding families having powers and one being exiled long age. Then a member of that long ago exiled family &#34;returning to exact revenge&#34;. Despite the fact that he and the people that he is exacting his revenge upon are so far removed from the time of the original exile.<br /><br />However, they somehow make it valid because of the fact that they bring their fathers into the mix. It doesn't hurt that these guys are pretty hot and I do so love Taylor Kitsh from Friday Night Lights. I could watch him in anything.
B006O5Y75Y|5.0|This has to definitely be the best entry in the series.  Even surpassing the original with Charlton Heston. It's well thought out, intelligent and makes one really care for the feelings of the Apes. Highly recommended!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Great take on the zombie flick especially since there are a billion and one out there now. I love the Walking Dead even though I am not a big zombie fan. These things have to have a decent storyline to follow. This one did and of course many of us women will watch anything they put Brad in...
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|About what you'd expect.  An attempt to throw the great Directors of the day and less than fully evolved plot, and even less interesting story line.  As if they tried to repackage ET. Worth a view.
0316056898|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I don't read many books, but this one I brought with me everywhere and read it within a few days. Tina Fey is a great author and you should buy this!
B0064NTZJO|3.0|A decent movie, to some degree a repetitious plot makes it easy to figure out the ending. While this was a decent flick, I did not particularly care for the 'shadows' vs. the viewing the live action, despite the artistic intent.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|The latest update brought a surge of new problems, such as:<br /><br />-Can no longer like, dislike, or reply to video comments in YouTube.<br />-Can no longer watch videos with captions within the app unless you download another specific video playing app. I can easily watch videos with captions using MX Player, but there's no way to skip the dialog box in TubeMate. The only workarounds are a.) Delete the captions or b.) Play the video outside of TubeMate. This is extremely jarring.<br /><br />I hope these issues are fixed soon, otherwise I'll have to find a new app.
B006O5Y09C|5.0|Despite my feelings about the Director, whose work I used to enjoy, this movie is really a work of art. The way it moves easily between time periods, the compelling feelings of those involved and how it gets expressed.  Truly worth viewing...outstanding!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|We got it quick. It was a gift for our grandson and he loved it! Everything's fine on this end.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Excelente regalo. El producto es tal y como se describe. Muy rápido los tiempos de entrega. No hay quejas. Lo recomiendo.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Son loved it. We don't get the show on our cable network. He loves the idea of watching it on my Kindle Fire.
1452105111|5.0|The quality was better than expected. I like how you can customize the garland and reuse if needed. This comes with a light blue string.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I'm learning but so far I like it. I hope buying coins is an option not an have to. Thanks
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Affleck is Good as DD, Plot better than average. I like it. Affleck is DD as Jane is the Punisher in my thinking.
B003TH2G4Y|5.0|Love, love, love this show! Liked this show so much that I had to read the books it was based on. The books are So much better and I can understand being upset with the series if you had read the books first. I'm glad that I watched the show first because I just can't imagine better people for the main characters, other than Darken Rahl, his book character is so different than the show's version. Also it really helped to imagine the magic and landscapes described in the book by watching the show first. After reading the Sword of Truth series I'm now re-watching all the episodes and enjoying the show all over again.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|If you don't purchase a large amount of chips your chances of winning is slim to none.  Even if you do it seems during sales and happy hours you rarely win.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It's not that I hate the game itself I really love Candy Crush and was thrilled to download it for my Kindle Fire. However, as soon as I downloaded it I began having problems with my kindle freezing up whether I was playing the game or not. It got to the point to where I had to remove the game and haven't had a problem since. I'm not sure if this is a common problem or if it's just my device but I would gladly give the game 5 stars if the problem is solved.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|One of those movies where you kept waiting for it to get better, but before you knew it, the credits were rolling.  Hard to believe these big names got roped into doing this.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Simply beautiful. The duality of Anne will stay with me always. Her humanity and optimism in such dire consequences reflect what should be within us all.
B002PLALCO|5.0|This is clearly one of the biggest highlights of Pink's career. She looks and sounds fabulous on this DVD. It would be a bargain at twice the price!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Bought this at the same time as the Plantronics to protect the headset and to provide backup power.  Allows me to throw the headset in my bag without worrying about damaging it.
143911000X|5.0|I got this for my brother and i havent really seen the show (how i met your mother) but i started reading it a bit and it actually has some advice mixed in with humor. Plus im a big fan of Neil Patrick Harris
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the best fantasy book I've ever read, more than Lord of the Rings, I can't wait to read the next book
1439152802|5.0|The ending was a total surprise - I did not see that coming.  This book is an easy read - it keeps your attention.  I didn't want to put it down.
B00EK3EFEA|5.0|A fabulous second album - though a departure from the first.  The first now strikes me as a young artist paying artful homage to her roots, with this second one being more of an emergence of her own voice.  I still listen to the first, but am also listening frequently to this second one.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I love it! This is  her best CD yet, every song is amazing, it's really, really, a CD worth buying!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Yo you might like this it's fast an it's easy but sometimes I get ......awesome!!!!! I played the first but I always wanted I.to 2 one to come
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|An easy and captivating read. Typical Grisham. Kind of anticipated the ending. A little too pat, could have used a few more twists and turns. Still worth the time to read though. If someone were to ask me, I would say; &#34;good, not great.&#34;
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great game. I love it!!!!  I play it over and over. I've had other mahjong games but this one is the best!!
B0091THRCU|4.0|Protects the phone and is also set up so the phone can be removed easily.  Wish it held more cards.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|From time to time you have good apps and then there are great apps. Weather ex is in between right now. I like all the options it offers and widgets, I recommend this app.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|We really like this game.<br />Lots of fun for the entire family! Great graphics, different things to do like the scratch game &amp; visiting other islands. Fun to see what others have done.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|Tim Burton is a wonderful comic director! A comic-horror film that is family-oriented with many laughs and a few scares! Definitely watchable by the whole family.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|The Signature of All Things is a gripping read.  Though fiction, it has a feeling of the non-fictional.  Alma is such a believable historical figure.  Her story totally explains the existence of books of beautiful botanic drawings and horticultural societies and people who care about Linnaeus.  And it’s so refreshing to read about someone obsessed with mosses instead of tulips or orchids. The research Gilbert must have done on botanical history, evolution, trade, Tahiti etc., is humbling.  I learned so much and thoroughly enjoyed the entire story.  I loved that Alma was large and ugly and smart.  It made her more interesting than being petite, lovely, and smart.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a great game it's entertaining and it fun the only thing is that some other packages in the game need money.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Did not like this book. Have no idea how it's been on the best sellers list for so long. Crazy characters....good book agent
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun, love the graphics...highly recommend. Wish there was another way to get coins and stars. Also would have loved if there were helpful hints or instructions. Again I do enjoy the game.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Very well written horror-mystery with many surprises. Keeps you interested till the very end. This book will not let you down.
0786891416|3.0|I expected a hardback copy of the book, not a paperback because my boyfriend is not too keen on paperback editions of books by authors he likes, and this is for his birthday on December 12, 2013, so I just hope he doesn't dislike it very much.  I would've loved to have presented him with Richard Castle's first book as a hardcover, but I guess that's just my bad luck.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Great writing; I would have given it 5 stars, but the story line was a little too predictable.  Still a can't put it down book.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I confess: I read this book on my Kindle — my eighth Kindle, no less! — and of course I bought the book from Amazon.com. As I have practically every other book I’ve read over the past eight or ten years. And I have to admit that I’ve bought lots of other stuff from the company over the years, including some really expensive items. Not so much because of the low prices, though I hardly object to them, as because of One-Click ordering, Amazon Prime, and the exceptionally good customer service<br /><br />So, why do I carry with me like a massive weight on my shoulders a festering hatred for the company and for the pile-driving founder who has built it into the behemoth it is today?<br /><br />Read Brad Stone’s revealing book, The Everything Store, and you’ll understand perfectly why that weight on my shoulders is so heavy.<br /><br />Take Amazon’s employees, for example. Not only does Jeff Bezos have a long history of verbal abuse directed at his employees — including senior executives who work closely with him — but he treats as a matter of principle denying them such modest benefits as free snacks and full reimbursement for using public transportation that are common in so many other large companies. In other words, he’s a skinflint. Bezos uses the excuse that he’s saving money to be able to offer customers the lowest possible prices. Somehow, though, his personal wealth keeps climbing. It’s now at $27 billion, according to Forbes. You’d think maybe he could afford to show a little appreciation for the people working for him.<br /><br />Then there are the suppliers. You know about book publishers, of course. You’ve probably seen your own neighborhood bookstore go out of business in recent years. Amazon wasn’t the sole cause, but it’s right up there at the top of the list. But it’s not just book publishers that Bezos treats with contempt. Stone includes an eye-opening account of the troubled relationship between Amazon and the prestigious German knife manufacturer, Wusthof. In order to gain access to Amazon’s seemingly unlimited customer base, the German firm is forced to run the risk that it will be put out of business by Amazon’s ugly habit of promoting cut-price suppliers of its own products. Why? Apparently because Jeff Bezos acts as though his libertarian creed requires him to defy not just any government-imposed limitations but rules or customs adopted by anyone else at all.<br /><br />No doubt Jeff Bezos loves his wife and kids and is affectionate toward furry little animals as well. Maybe his close friends even like him. But both his reputation and Brad Stone’s deeply researched account suggest that he is a thoroughly despicable CEO.<br /><br />Brad Stone follows the leading technology companies for Bloomberg Businessweek.

B0041D843M|5.0|I was confinced.  started vegan diet after reading this book. I only eat one meal with animal ingredients every week.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I have loved all the Pendergast books, some more so than others of course, but this one stood out.  The previous volume seemed to try to turn Pendergast into a more action-oriented figure a la James Bond, but in &#34;White Fire&#34; he returns to his original, quirky Sherlockian roots.  In fact, this is underlined with a mock &#34;undiscovered&#34; Conan Doyle story embedded in the novel, and Pendergast uses it and some more of his Tibetan memory journey tricks to reveal the story within the story.<br /><br />There is an historic mystery pursued  by Pendergast's prot&eacute;g&eacute; (?) Corrie Swanson, the headstrong young woman from the wrong side of the tracks who is now studying criminology.  Her self-centered rashness perfectly captures her youthfulness, even as it irritates the reader; she is all fire while Pendergast is cool and almost always collected.  The town that draws them is a former mining town turned ski mecca for the ultra-rich and celebrity crowd, intentionally painted as a Gomorrah headed for a fall.  When a serial murderer/arsonist strikes, the overstretched police chief enlists help from Pendergast.  He does his usual thing and his investigation, along with the first storm of the winter, helps bring past and present together in an explosive and thoroughly entertaining story as only Messrs. Preston and Child can deliver.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I like Bond films. This one has a dual plot. The 50th anniversary of Bond films. M's last Bond film.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works well, but if you don't use Netflix it doesn't have much use.  If you have a recent game console, or a media center PC this won't be very useful unless you travel and sit in your room a lot.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I was really looking for something that wasn't dependent on the Wi-Fi.....since I don't have WiFi at home.  This was okay otherwise.
1401917232|5.0|It is a GREAT book.  Well, worth the wait.  I love that he's so funny and honest.  Very, Very good.  I hope there's more in his future.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Of course we are all addicted to our social media.  This makes it easier on me....I don't have to wear my reading glasses to see everything on my Kindle Fire HD.  and it's way more convenient than my laptop.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Blake Crouch is a terrorist!  This book arouses as much terror as one can stand.  From the beginning of the book to the end it is a nightmare inducing story that never eases up.  The plot is ingenious, the characters are compelling, and the action is about as extreme as can be believable.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I play this all the time.  I am so addicted but there are worse things...I guess.  I love Mahjong and this will keep me busy when I fly.
B006PERRMY|1.0|This movie sought out to teach a lesson on the value of time---  It's true, time is valuable, and I want the 1 hour and 50 minutes back that I wasted on this horrible movie!!!
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Such a cute movie....of course I expected that from DreaWorks Entertainment.  I got this for my granddaughter and can't wait to see if she likes it too.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It's vintage Grisham, but the story line lagged every now and then.  I enjoyed reading about the main characters I read about many years ago.
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|I had seen Monsters Inc....and love this one too!  This is destined to become a family classic.  Can't wait to see Jordan's reaction to this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I downloaded it it took FOREVER it just restarded. if it works I think it is a pretty rad game for my kindle fire.it takes too mush space but wat de hey
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|well it,s little tricky to setup somethings lose there connections but once you get good connection it works very well But there are a lot of things you can not stream, so it is far from perfect but if you read the online information there is only few apps and not all WiFi is easily to setup<br /> some of the things it does is hard to figure out , but overall not too bad  I think it could be better
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the book.  I read it in just a few days.  It leaves you wanting more, so that makes it a good book for me.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Castle Ville Legends is just as much fun and addictive as the Facebook version. A lot of Familiar charters with new stories. I was very happy to see a Kindle Fire edition. I hope to see other Facebook favorites on the Kindle Fire soon.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|It's enjoyable and once you get the hang of it, you can get good at it.  They give you a lot of games before you get to the part where you'd have to spend money.  I play daily, just for relaxation, but I think it's also good to keep your mind alert and focus on something.<br />I also like that if you get stuck on one game, you can always go on to the next and come back later . I often do this and when I do, I usually can get it the 2nd time.  I did find one game that is not solvable.  It's pretty obvious but one out of all those hundreds isn't bad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app it is what I spend most of free time on. This the real one there is another app and it always crashes this is the real one. This is the best app ever  I can look up pics for homework
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great little product for a very reasonable price!  I usually watch Netflix on my PS3, but I don't like listening to the drive spin all the time and I'm always thinking about how I'm wearing down my PS3 just to watch Netflix, so this was an ideal solution!  Was simple to set up from my Galaxy Note 2 (point Chrome browser to setup site and \\"Request Desktop Site\\") and it took about 3 minutes total.<br /><br />There are some things I would change about the Netflix Android app (like automatic progression to the next show in a season) but as for the Chromecast, the device itself is great!  Would be nice to be able to turn it on and off from the Chromecast app to save the small amount of power it uses as well as wear on the device, but overall I felt at the price this is definitely a 5-star value!<br /><br />Now if only Google would hurry up and release the finished SDK to developers we'd be able to see what this little device is really capable of!
0070511136|5.0|This book came into my life at a time when I was struggling with marketing.  It was recommended highly to me by a fellow marketer, I purchased it based upon his recommendation, and have never regretted it for a moment.  Very practical advice, makes the mystical tasks often associated with sales seem so natural and logical!  If you are in sales at all, YOU NEED THIS BOOK!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as I wanted to project videos from my computer to my TV!  Sound and Video work great!  Simple set up.
B00594XOZU|2.0|KIK Always acts up when I go too log in it loads &amp; says something like it took too long  don't get it why doesn't it work please fix Kik I need too use it
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Love the accuracy of flight and weapons performance. Hope they add more planes to the inventory. Do they have a world war two game?<br />Great game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very fun and addicting.  very frustrating and exciting.  get very aggravated when things do not go well.  spend a lot of time trying to win.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I was expecting a lot more with the hype. The ending was kind of predictable and the reading didn't get good until about the last 50 pages. I did, however, really enjoy the epilogue. Even though it's only a couple of pages, it added an interesting perspective.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I enjoyed myself but I'm afraid it's one of those games that if I don't constantly play everything dies on me. :(<br />But I'll see how it goes when it's my turn to drive eight hours yah we do it like the truck drivers. lol
B00GIZO674|5.0|I love this  game soooooo much I used to play it on my computer now I can play it on my kindle get it
0205313426|5.0|Invaluable to anybody who writes, whether for pleasure, work or for a living.  I have worn out several copies and recommend this as a gift to any student going off to college, or even in high school.  The lessons on this book come in useful again and again.
0141394811|5.0|Arrived sooner than expected. I'm very happy about that. The book itself is very good. My only complaint is that there are no chapters. Clearly the author's fault.
B00555X8OA|3.0|It was too repetitive.  It contained alot of insight into people but could have been said with less text.  I would recommend it to selective people.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book reminds me of a piece of rope composed of three strands.  It begins with what appear to be three unrelated stories, but of course the reader knows they have to be related.  One story, and perhaps the most important one, focuses on a middle-aged woman named Cecilia who discovers an old envelope sealed with aging tape among her husband's tax records in the attic.  It is addressed to her, but it is supposed to be opened only in case of his death.<br /><br />A second story is told from the point of view of an elderly woman named Rachel.  Her daughter was murdered many years ago at the age of 17 and Rachel is convinced she knows who did it, but the police say there is no evidence to support her belief.  Rachel has a son who is married and his son is the joy of her life.  She learns that her son, daughter-in-law and grandson will be moving from Australia to New York for the daughter-in-law's job.  Rachel is distraught over this move.<br /><br />The third story is told by Tess who along with her husband Will and her cousin and best friend Felicity, run a graphics design business in Sydney.  Will and Felicity tell Tess that they have fallen in love but have not had sex.  Tess takes their young son and moves to her mother's house in Melbourne.<br /><br />In the beginning, I found it difficult to keep the names and stories straight and it seemed a bit slow, but once the lives of the three women became intertwined, it was no longer difficult to keep the women straight. I found it very difficult to put the book down after that, especially after I learned the husband's secret.<br /><br />I thought the characters were well developed and their daily lives were well portrayed.<br /><br />I haven't decided what I think about the ending and don't want to say more, as it would spoil it for others.  I don't think it needed the epilogue, but I've read several other reviews that liked it a lot.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a very good book.  She has a great depth of understanding of human nature.  Much enjoyed by me and my swimming pool group.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great note taking and organizing application  great for everyone's usage  Great for permenantly storing data pictures, etc.,,,,,try it you'll like it
B003L77G10|5.0|The chemistry among the characters is electric.  The plots continue to be interesting.  I hope this series goes on for at least ten years!
B001BANK32|4.0|A classic. Took me years to actually to getting around reading it. I love the movie, but it does not compare to real psychological fear the book in stills in you.
B0019BI1FA|5.0|Oscar Wilde was a genius.  From the almost slapstick humor in The Importance of Being Earnest to the macabre Picture of Dorian Gray, he keeps the tale moving.  Thank you, English Lit, for introducing me to a classic that manages to be current!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really enjoy the game play and the colorful graphics. The game play is easy to catch on to. Love it!!
B00BC5I6Q2|1.0|Just awful.  I know that it's based on a British series but what you'll notice if you watch is that it's a dash of West Wing, a bit of Newsroom and a small helping of All The President's Men.<br /><br />But sadly, it does none of these very well.<br /><br />Be ready not to connect to any of the characters.  Be ready to hear them all speak in the same tone of voice.  Be ready to notice that this isn't about &#34;Inside the Beltway&#34; at all.  It's a glorified soap opera with unlikeable characters----not very well acted as well.<br /><br />Watch something else.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I wanted to read this book before i seen it at the movies. Great lesson for children when you want them to learn this subject. Just a little confusing at first.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I found &#34;Argo&#34; to be well-directed and acted, satisfying in a technical sense but oddly flat emotionally. Perhaps what is missing is a clear sense of the totalitarian ruthlessness of the Ayatollah Khomeni regime and the extent of the danger threatening the escapes should they be caught. Were the producers concerned lest they &#34;offend&#34; certain parties? Whatever the case, even with the outcome known in advance &#34;Argo&#34; should have delivered more suspense.
B002QP145C|5.0|Well done.  Brutal fighting against insane odds. NFound cover pictures strange as they appear to be US soldiers from late WWIi.
B0007939NO|5.0|It's a classic. The storyline is interesting, and it's in color. A great musical and must have for your collection.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|Although I found this book fascinating and disturbing, I wanted more from the story. I know I can create the ending, but  I  wanted more  fascination. I would recommend this book for mature children, teens and adults. Good for book groups that like short reads.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addictive!  Glad that it finally came to Kindle.  I love the game but I keep losing my lives. Hope they have an update soon.
B007CF7L9O|5.0|It is simple, this buddy is big, very big... What made it an instant favorite for my 2y old boy.<br />Kudos to Papo for another amazing figurine.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it's very addictive but it's a great game.All of my friends are playing, my hubby as well and this game as well was free.
1478925000|1.0|Nothing against the seller! This is the worst of the King and Maxwell series, seems to be cobbled together for market purposes only with no sign of the gripping racy interesting, though sometimes improbable plots of previous books in this series. Save your money and forget this uninspiring boring book which really killed King and Maxwell for me.
B00127RAJY|1.0|Wow, not sure how this received so many 5 star reviews! The techniques she uses are NOT good for the knees and back! I have tried just about every workout dvd there is and am a big runner, but I have NEVER had knee pain until I did this BEGINNER section. The butt kicks and reverse squats as cardio and other moves in other sections are so bad for the knees.<br /><br />I had pain climbing stairs for almost a week after doing the beginner workout ONCE!<br /><br />To be fair, I did read reviews about knee pain, but I figured they must be inexperienced or overweight. I weigh 130 after having had a baby 8 mos ago and saw this recommended on several baby/pregnancy sites which is pretty scary since abs and back muscles are not able to support you doing these twisting and jumping moves. I can go out and run 5 miles with no problem and do any of my other workout DVDs but this one gives me knee and back pain.<br /><br />I tried the other levels too and it doesn't get better. This one's going in the trash. I'll stick with Personal Training with Jackie [[ASIN:B002L6HDAQ Personal Training Jackie Power Circuit]] and the Firm instead.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This was a good and challenging game I think that you can get a good idea of how to get and play the game I think that you will like to have my little pony games.
B005COO1X6|2.0|While there is only so much you can put into a short story, Stephen King has done much better with his early short stories (especially those written under a pseudonym).  I always end up enjoying a King story but this one just felt flat and a bit recycled.  Nothing new for me here and not as much of the character development that makes his long novels so compelling and hard to put down.  Nope - just can't recommend this one.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Didn't do what we had hoped (and been led to believe) it would do, sent it back. Love the Roku
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|Bride Bella - Just a beautiful image of Bella to treasure always. The dress is lovely and the doll so well presented as a keepsake.
0694003611|5.0|Fabulous, excellent, every baby and toddler should have their own copy. Ours will go into the memory box as we read it so much.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|Plan to watch soon, can't wait.  This completes the set for us.  I will share it too, as friends also liked it.
B003EVWDR0|1.0|Boring, derivative, and generic in every way. From the fake-looking CGI to the fact that this movie is just a Pocahontas ripoff with blue cat people, this movie thoroughly bored me from beginning to end. Also, the villains are as generic as the story; mean military guys who are evil for the sake of being evil. The movie is atrociously dull and amazingly overrated.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|We love this show.  I have shared with a lot of friends and they enjoyed it also! Sent it out as a gift too.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book was good and weird. I enjoyed the book but wasn't at all pleased with the ending. Is there going to be a sequel? There were so many unanswered questions. I loved the storyline. The characters could've been developed a bit more. All in all it was worth the buy. I want more though. I would really like to know about some of the characters and their previous adventures and what happens to one in particular that disappears.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Alrighty, let me describe this game in 3 words. BEST. GAME. EVER. I just love this game! I'm a tomboy, but I love this game. Just, just plz, plz don't judge me. So I love my little pony. So I love LPS. That doesn't mean you get to laugh at me. I love minecraft. I love Sonic. I love Big Bang Theory. I can still like LPS and My Little Pony. But I still like this game!
0060849827|5.0|Best book ever out of all the books I have purchased on survival. I have bought multiple to put in kids 72 hr kits and for the vehicles. A must have book. Definite buy.
B005ZI306S|4.0|Good story for children to realize that lucky charms or superstitions can be a little silly sometimes. You can also find back luck if you are looking for it. Always good to go the other way and find the lucky side of life.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Kids and Me love this video. I didn't even have to ask who wanted to watch it. They all we Ready with Popcorn and Drinks. Great Movie.
B006PKV2QU|5.0|Cute story. My grandchildren enjoyed it. Sometimes I wonder what's in my shoe. Any child would find it amusing and worth listening to.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is the simplest of cases I've read in a Grisham novel and yet compelling. Nice to reconnect with Jake Brigance and the other residents of Ford County. Grisham provides a tight story line that I kept wondering how will Jake ever get out of this. Any good story makes me sent to know more. Maybe there is another Ford County story waiting to be told.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good movie, Denzel Washington is a great actor. See Training Day Great pilots still have flaws but I would rather have a great pilot in the cockpit than a perfect mediocre pilot
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I have been a Green Lantern fan ever since I was a little boy!! All of us neighborhood kids use to run around pretending we were superheroes, did not care if they were DC or Marvel characters, we just loved playing!!!!  On of the most popular characters that we use to fight over on who gets to play that role was....Yup....you guessed it, Hal Jordan, THE Green Lantern!!!!  One of my buddies made a green lantern ring and we use to wear it whenever we played, good times back when we were all young and innocent!!!  When they said a movie of Green Lantern was being made, I was so excited and then I found out that Ryan Reynolds was the main character, I just couldn't wait!!  A friend of mine said he saw it the day it came out and said it was &#34;Just OK&#34;!!  What the hell did that mean???  I never go by what critics say, why should I, we are all different people with different taste, I loved this movie and that is why I bought it on Bluray!!!!  I watch it whenever I can and both of my boys like it too!!!  I like the story, could have been a little bit more interesting but it was good, I like the computer graphics, and Hal, and carol were great!!!  Good actors and actress and they worked well together!!!  Bluray quality was fantastic and would recommend this movie anytime of the year to anybody!!!!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Allows me to know I won't run out of battery life on my headset!  It's also a good protective case!
B002YVAT72|5.0|I bought this record player around three years ago and I have had no problems. I initially was going to rip a few of my albums, but I think I only ever got around to three of them. If I remember right the included software will only let you rip to a Max of 192kbs, so you might want to use Audacity.  I have the unit in my living room hooked up to a set of computer speakers and I use it for my everyday stereo. The sound is great. The only thing is I bought the player for around $60 new, so you might want to wait for it to come down in price.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have a love hate relationship with Facebook.  Love to keep posted on people, but hate the derogatory posts on our president.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|Smart and concise read from a smart team at 37 Signals. Not a one-size fits all solution, but a must-read for future thinking about running business and engaging employees.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|This book is great for out of shape people (like myself.) It had way more easier versions of exercises that help you work up to the actual exercises than anything else I've looked at. And he explains why those rudimentary versions must be practiced before the harder ones. Super inspiring too talking about strength that can be used in real life versus just in the gym.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|The author seems not to have an outline of the real story.  No real investigations. You want to read the how then the story stops and you start reading a new section. Only after about 50% of the book do you really starting to get into it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Just couldn't get into it...no matter how many times I picked it back up, I just put it back down...looked good but not for me.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Amazing CD! Every song is different and highly unique- a must buy! I have been playing it on repeat for days!
B007SGM084|5.0|What a great book to go &#34;viral&#34;, easy read (once you get past the bodice ripper content). So glad I have the omnibus!
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|So after over a hundred listens (easy) I would like to post my review.  Necessary pre-emptive disclaimers: I am a long time Trivium fan and have been since I first saw &#34;Pull Harder&#34; on late night cable tv metal music on demand in 2005.  This Friday night will be my 7th show and am excited to finally see them since the 2009 Into the Mouth of Hell We Tour with Chimaira (during the Rob Arnold years)!!!<br /><br />Track 1 - Brave this Storm 4/5<br />This track rips.  The message is clear and lyrics strong, reminiscent of In Waves, but then you hear a small David Draiman influence with Matt's cadence and everyone throws their arms up and declares &#34;Heresy!!&#34;.  If this track doesn't grab you by the balls during the post-chorus bridge pre-solo (????) then you may want to skip to track 4 when it starts to sound like the Ascendancy that you thought Trivium had forgotten about.<br /><br />Track 2 - Vengeance Falls 3/5<br />Totally average.  Corey has no amazing work here, rhythm sections shows a bit with some different off-beat breaks, but what really makes me want to rate this track higher is Matt's vocal developments.  It's obvious here.  You can hear a bit in the Ascendancy-style bridge (again but welcomed).<br /><br />Track 3 - Strife 4/5<br />So Strife comes along after hearing it a hundred times before the album even came out, and I've really grown to like it.  Paolo shreds on that verse baseline and then Matt with his Draiman voice delivers a lyric that I don't think he could've without a little push from something different i.e. Draiman.  Throw in the staple Trivium Hey-Hey's and I'm sold.<br /><br />Track 4 - No Way to Heal 5/5<br />Personal favorite.  This is peak metal production right now, for anyone who isn't familiar.  Matt harkens back to Ascendancy with some Crusade hooks and Travis-style drumming from Nick Augusto (shocked yet).  Enter Corey shredding a solo then the Matt/Corey duet and then you're fed a healthy chorus?!?!?<br /><br />Track 5 -To Believe 4/5<br />This is new territory for Trivium.  Matt's starting a new singing style entirely.  Nick pushes this track along with a great rhythm.  Corey's pretty much staying tamed, but I think it's the great presence Paolo brings to the rhythms in this band.  What do you think?<br /><br />Track 6 - At the End of This War 5/5<br />Second best track on this disc, hands down.  Vocals similar to Matt's sound he found during Shogun but dare I say it more AWESOME.  Corey can barely contain himself during these riffs, and the main chorus is worth repeating a dozen times when you hear some great rhythms from Paolo and Nick.<br /><br />Track 7 - Through Blood and Dirt and Bone 5/5<br />So you thought Trivium had changed so much by now that you gave up, right?  This is your redemption.  The game changer.  This is like Baby Shogun Pt. 1 (The B-Sides).  Dramatic, enthralling, worth listening to repeatedly.  Arguably the best track on this disc and it's totally underrated.<br /><br />Track 8 - Villainy Thrives 3/5<br />You know, Trivium is the type of band who likes to try something new every time.  Usually around track 8, relative to the length of the album of course.  The lyrics are strong, but it sounds like the Crusade-style anthem they love to make sure you remember you're listening to Trivium, even though you might think otherwise?<br /><br />Track 9 - Incineration: The Broken World 6/5<br />Best Trivium song ever.  This is Matt, Corey, Nick and Paolo embracing new territory that I think (dare I say it again) they may not have discovered without David Draiman.  The production here is top notch, again.  He may have only had some influence on Matt's singing, but when I think of the best sounds Draiman has produced, this sounds like his work and it sounds great with Trivium playing the parts.  I have been singing this song everywhere I go for about 2 weeks now and nearly have it nailed.  If there's a track you'll be wanting to hum, it's this one.<br /><br />Track 10- Wake (The End is Nigh) 5/5<br />More new vocal territory for Matt, right from the baritone notes.  How do you think he sounds?  I think it's good, especially when you hear the floating Corey harmonies with the Paolo finger picks underneath, then that haunting Trivium sound they capitalize on.  I think this track also has a lot of production input from Draiman.  It's complex, and a little different for the Trivium sound, but that's the beauty and the curse - they always want to try a new sound but lose that sound we all love at the same time?!?!?<br /><br />Track 11 - No Hope for the Human Race, As I Am Exploding, Skulls (We Are 138)  5/5<br />These tracks really should have been standard release.  I hope it's not a marketing ploy and they really couldn't fit the other 3 songs on the first batch of cd's (witchcraft I say) then everyone should be enjoying these, they are among the best Trivium tracks!  It's about time we got some Trivium doing some great covers!
B000001DWG|5.0|I always loved mother love bone. It's a blast from the past! Sound quality is good. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This game is great,graphics are great sound is great and cars are great. But there is one problem, in the game to start you buy one car and there is a &quot;section&quot; of races for that car which takes a while to complete, if you want the full game experience you have to buy every car which takes a long time. There is one other problem but it's not that bad; you can only customize the color  of the car, no mods or hoods or anything to make it look good. But over all this game is GREAT and I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good challenging race game
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I chose three stars because this book wasn't my style of reading but I really like the story. When characters effect me emotionally and I get excited or sad about something then it's good. I wouldn't  recommend this book to the faint hearted or sexually awkward. Overall fast read and finished within a day.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I bought the book because I love watching the Bones series. The book follows the Dr. Brennan as she tries to solve a series of murders that takes her to Alaska. It's an enjoyable read and funny, too.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised.  Not a lot of apps yet, but projecting laptop content to my big screen is well worth the $35.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is my favorite show. I started watching it since the beginning. I purchased Season 4 to have on my iPad when we traveled to Europe. It was nice to have a familiar show to watch and not have to read subtitles.
B000CRKW9A|5.0|Saw this a long time ago but the video store has been long closed and I could only find this at Amazon.  The movie is very real, powerful and disturbing and, of course, Jennifer Jason Leigh is fantastic as always.
1476758581|5.0|This is for the Book & Audiobook:<br />I love this book. It's a different take on the Secret.<br />I cannot say enough good things about this author. She has changed my life. I still have miles to go, but every day I strive to do better, and BELIEVE. Two weeks after the SECRET, I found my home on the water, which I could afford! I wanted to go to Hawaii, then won a trip to the Hawaiian Islands! I just got my KITE BLUE Mini Cooper. I have the man of my dreams and our relationship is all I ever wanted and more! We travel everywhere now. I am not making this up.<br />THANK YOU RHONDA! I have loved all your books! Keep them coming!<br />LIFE IS SO GOOD.<br />I believe in the Magic of the Universe.<br />THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU !<br />P.S. Thank you for more music by Jo Blankenburg. I love him too!
B0046ECJBY|5.0|A statesman's views of an emerging giant, China, the second largest economy in the world, and coping with the challenges of participating in global civilisation.  Henry Kissinger shares his understanding of China from his elevated interaction  with leaders over the years in the world of diplomacy.  He presents China in historical perspective emerging from the medieval empire called the middle kingdom or the centre of the earth, to a modern nation with internal and external challenges of growth and change.  A must read for anyone interested in history.  Kissinger writes with an excitement mostly found in novels and with an intellectual elegance of a professor who has seen world affairs first hand.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I really like these types of games. However I sort of cheated on the last two levels and I wish I hadn't.  I will keep the app and wait for more rooms and maybe not cheat this time
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Any movie that lasts over 2 hours that keeps me in my seat is a winner! The director also did the movie &#34;Moulin Rouge&#34; whose style I love, and the costumes, choreography and music were outstanding.  DiiCaprio was a genius with his rendition of Gatsby. A wonderful rendtion of the novel.  My 19 year old daughter watched with me and now wants to read the book.
B00DI75SWM|1.0|I have a kindle fire so I can't save I find this very frustrating please allow it just to save to your device instead of having to make it your wallpaper :)
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My almost 3 year old son loves the Dr. Panda apps - some are better than others and this is one of his favorites. He needs no help navigating the app after I showed him how some of the features worked. Not particularly educational but fun and interactive.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is a GREAT cast and a GREAT production... this is the ultimate haunted house story!<br />I strongly suggest you don't miss it!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|3 year old loves Dr.Panda. Not tremendously educational but has a puzzle and some item matching. Easy for 2 or 3 year old to use.
B00G70K1HY|5.0|After X-Men: The Last Stand, I kind of fell out of love with the X-movies. Then X-men: First Class got me excited again, but I had completely lost interest with the modern storyline. X2 is the best of the originals, but it still has it's hokey moments and general kid-friendliness. Xmen 1 is decent, but not my favorite. I never really loved an X-men movie until first class.<br /><br />So when they announced The Wolverine, I didn't get too excited. But then I heard that they wanted to do it in Japan, Mangold was a good director, but I still didn't really feel the motivation. And then I read that Mangold said he had an extended and R-rated version of his movie. That had me curious. The trailer for the movie didn't sell me at all, but I'm a cinephile, so I figured I'll wait and see the unrated version, although I assumed it would be indistinguishably different.<br /><br />Having just watched The Wolverine, I can say this is the best X-men film yet. Better than X2 and better than First Class (both of which I really dug)<br /><br />The movie feels adult. I can't stress enough how much I mean that as a compliment. There is no goofiness, no terrible one liners, winks at the audience about other X-men or Marvel references. This is an honest to it's story and focused on it. Wolverine's claws maim people and he smokes and swears. And with the unrated edition, one might think this would be video game levels of violence. Amazingly not the case. It's unhinged but reserved at the same time. Restraint was shown and yet nothing feels held back.<br /><br />Not since Nolan's Bat films have I really felt a superhero movie that was mature. This didn't feel like a superhero movie, it felt like an action film abotu a guy with claws. And it's so much better for it.<br /><br />With The Avengers, Batman vs Superman, and X-men Days of Future Past, we aren't afforded opportunities to tell focused superhero stories anymore. Here we got actual character development, and a story that was smallerbut all the better for it. Last time I appreciated a smaller film like this was Thor.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is the best X-men film, but you wouldn't know it. It stands on it's own as a very mature film. I hope future superhero films take a page out of Mangold's book. And now I'm not at all disappointed there will be another one. (But there are other X-men needing films)
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun but frustrating. I recommend having A LOT of friends who play or you'll be waiting ages for additional lives. Can only play a few minutes before using up all of them.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|its easy fun relaxing. will recommend it to anyone. the battle is so instresting, it just an easy way to relax and have fun
B00985E3UG|4.0|Great read, full of information we don't hear about. I learned a great deal from this book. Great sources also!
B00G32OER4|5.0|I love the work of that the Warrens have done, and also on Paranormal State with Ryan Buell's cases. This was a class act all the way around scare you to death, movie. The stories being true make them more gripping and make you think about the choices you make and living right. Believing in god, a higher power, another existance for those that doubt......Love, Love,.Loved this movie and will for sure be getting for my collection. I was never fond of dolls as a little girl, they still give me the creeps!!!!  Plus it makes you think about what you get at yard sales and thrift stores when you could be bringing something that should be locked up, into your home. Get this movie you will not be sorry, and the actors are some of my fav's. Great from beginning to end!!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The book is difficult at first and then it is sooo Stephen King! On the edge of my seat and love the characters.
B00004U8P9|4.0|It's Rocky horror Picture show. Who wouldn'y like it. There were many special features and extras that makes it kworthwhile.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun game to test your skill.  Sometimes a little frustrating, but fun!  Try it you will be hooked, too!  Good luck.
1592407889|1.0|Having enjoyed Shirley MacLaine as an actress, I was looking forward to reading this book. I was well aware, through the title, that it may not reflect too positively on her...but I was quite unprepared for the shock of it.  It was quite a sordid and difficult read. Ms. Parker accuses her mother of embellishing the truth, I do believe though, that Ms. Parker does plenty of the same.  What an amazingly dysfunctional family!!!  Aside from her parents, Ms. Parker appears to be totally self absorbed and lacking her own moral compass.  She exploits her parents dirty laundry in this book to earn money for herself.  The apple really didn't fall far from the tree....did it Ms. Parker!!!!
B00AW8UK0K|2.0|The way this book was written made it boring and repetitive. The author was passionate about the subject but I feel that the message was lost.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|A young lawyer thinks he can use the momentum from a career-changing case to carry him through a new challenge: one of the town’s wealthiest—some would argue the wealthiest resident—writes a holographic will that cuts out his entire family and leaves 90 percent of his estate to his maid and then commits suicide.  In the suicide note the man names the lawyer the one responsible for making sure the holographic will gets fulfilled to the last letter, and all of a sudden the young lawyer starts to wonder whether this case will break his fortitude.  John Grisham brings back the main character from his first novel, A Time to Kill, for his latest book, Sycamore Row.<br /><br />In 1988 Clanton, Mississippi, Jake Brigance continues to practice law.  Three years have passed since he won the phenomenal verdict of an acquittal for a black man who killed his daughter’s rapists.  When that case ended Jake rode a tidal wave of moral support and felt the certainty that the verdict would dramatically change his fortune.  He’d survived threats from the KKK and losing his home to arson, but surely everything would get better.<br /><br />In reality Jake still struggles to pay his bills.  Police still patrol his street every night to guard him and his family from any additional threats.  And he’s still waiting for that one big case that will elevate his financial status for good.<br /><br />So when he receives a letter in the mail from Seth Hubbard, he feels like he has his chance.  Seth mails the letter the day before committing suicide.  Tired of dealing with his aggressive lung cancer, he has decided to end it all and he wants Jake fulfill his last wishes by taking on the role of lawyer for the estate.  With the most sincere of intentions, Jake accepts the task.<br /><br />Clanton, however, is a small town, and news travels fast about the will.  Seth Hubbard’s children return to town to wail and cry about the loss of their father (the fact that they hated the man notwithstanding,) and the maid who will ultimately benefit from the will suddenly finds herself surrounded by family and friends.  Seth also leaves five percent of his estate to his brother, but no one knows where Ancil Hubbard is.<br /><br />Jake must deal with it all—the greedy, self-centered children, the task of finding Ancil, and trying to convince Lettie, Seth’s former maid, to trust him.  When other hotshot lawyers swoop into town to take their own “piece of the pie,” things only get more complicated.<br /><br />Veteran author John Grisham once again has penned a novel that marches along at a brisk pace, but this book may leave readers underwhelmed.  Frequent over-usage of terms (particularly the one about pie) and some redundancies will make readers want to skip ahead a few paragraphs.  Because so many parties want to get their shot at Seth Hubbard’s fortune, almost a dozen lawyers end up in court at one point making the presiding judge—and the readers watching the whole scene—huff in consternation.<br /><br />Several minor characters keep asking themselves and each other one big question: why did Seth Hubbard leave so much money to a maid he’d only employed for three years?  The answer does not necessarily come as a surprise to anyone, especially once Ancil’s whereabouts are determined.  Grisham’s revelations stay true to 1988 Mississippi, but for once the discussions along racial lines sound a little too pat and rehearsed.  Jake Brigance, too, comes across as somewhat one-dimensional.  He stays his course, and despite the enormous fee he will earn if he successfully completes his task he doesn’t really let money propel him forward.  Many of Grisham’s protagonists have exhibited shades of gray, thereby coming across as real and likable and making readers cheer them on.  Jake Brigance falls short in this regard.<br /><br />Still, die-hard Grisham fans may like this one.  It may not necessarily be worth the full purchase, but for those of you wanting a speedy read and a lot of legal talk in Grisham’s signature style do make it a point to borrow Sycamore Row from the library.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm in love with this game. I really can't stop playing. All I think about during class is playing this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that this is a skillful game and has a lot of action. I'm not saying that you have to have a lot of skill to play but I just think it is fun to play and see if you can get a really high score. I would definitely recommend this to my friends to play so you should to. Play this game it is just really fun to play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game grabs you and holds on...it is a good thing you only get 5 lives at a time or you could waste a LOT of time!
B00E66QPCG|5.0|A good strategy with specifics. Very useful each trade! The technical lndicators are good, but the number values for exits are the best part.
B00C1040TO|5.0|Thanks Amazon and dev, this is my new best friend, every musician needs this. Pro interface and useful features- clearly written by musicians for musicians. Samsung Galaxy SII
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great sound, great fit. The bad news is they are no longer marketed and for the ones remaining the price has gone through the roof and increasing every day.
1596680199|5.0|Mom loved it! Lots of fun new ideas to keep her busy when she cant sleep! She's been busy making lots of fun things!
B004I744AS|5.0|It's always very reliable and informational. It doesn't  mal functioning  so to speak, and its very cool how it offers extras at the opening screen.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Excellent !!! Their best album so far,all of them are great but I like this one the best,strait ahead rocker and I like every song on the album.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app would not load on my kindle. Took 20 minutes to download and then would not load. Seems like it would be fun.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|After a few issues all is well in my kingdom!! Amazon support is amazing and so helpful. I was disappointed when I got my kindle fire for Christmas and could not play castle ville. I recommend this game to anyone. The graphics are great. Great fun.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|love this movie. i'm a fan of the originals and this one did it justice. army of darkness is a classic! this has become one of my new favorites or the new breed of horror movies
B000KIPT30|4.0|It has great sound.  I hooked it up to my Bose headphones and It sounds very clear.  For some reason, my Bravia Sony TV audio out did not have a volume control.  So, I hooked the amp to the TV and headphone to the amp.  Works like a charm.  I hate the wireless headphones and batteries. So, this fits the bill.  Only con - no off/on switch.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|such a great album. i love their last few releases, and this one holds true to the quality you would expect. if you like them, you won't be disappointed.
B00E9HML1Q|2.0|I own all box editions of LOTR and compared to them Hobbit one is made rather poorly. Figurine cannot match LOTR ones, box filling is cheapish (plastic cover is stuck to styrofoam with transparent tape...). You cannot but regret the space the oversized box will take.<br /><br />Not worth the money.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|it took me a few times of watching this movie to really like it, but it's pretty good. not my favorite tarrantino movie, but it has an excellent cast and excellent acting.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This book reads like the first draft of an Emo young adult novel. The only things its missing is for someone to fall in love with a vampire. The characters are one dimensional and stereotypical, the phrasing is repetitive, and the story line seems disorganized and poorly thought out. I am a big supporter of the independent author movement, but this book needs a lot of work. It does not get better in any of the later volumes either. The only reason it gets two stars is the strength of the concept.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A good, basic book about Nikola Tesla.  For someone who knows little of this genius, this can serve as a wonderful introduction.  For anyone who has studied this man's life and work, this will not likely provide very much new information.  Still, the author is to be commended for the effort.  It is a national disgrace that Tesla is still virtually unknown to Americans.  He literally made the twentieth century possible.
B008JFUN50|4.0|“Elysium” the luxurious living environment created in Space for the very rich and famous. There is no entry to this eco-system for the rest of the people on Earth who are considered to be poor. It is controlled by a President, Patel and a power hungry Defense Secretary, Jessica. This eco-system has a clean environment devoid of any diseases and the capability to cure any kind of human disorder within seconds in a specialized medical bed call ‘Med Bay’ accessible only for the citizens of Elysium - the main reason why all the people on the devastated earth want an access to Elysium. Jessica prevents illegal entries into Elysium through her dangerous ally on Earth, Kruger.<br />Max de Costa, who works in a company called Armadyne, headed and owned by John Carlyle, which supplies arms and critical software to Elysium, once, accidentally gets exposed to radiation and is sacked, for he shall die in 5 days. Max wants to go to Elysium and get treated since he wants to live with his childhood girl friend Frey, but will be denied access. He approaches his old friend and arms smuggler Spider, who agrees to send Max to Elysium, provided, he gets the valuable software that controls the entire Elysium and Armadyne embedded in a chip stored in the brain of John Carlyle. Max agrees for the trade off, without knowing the underlying danger.<br />At the same time, Jessica enters into a secret business deal with John, to create a software that could make her, the President of Elysium. John creates the same and stores it in his chip with an encryption that can be copied only to a similar chip but kills the person to whom it is downloaded in, for a reboot. Spider installs a similar chip into Max’s brain and downloads the software into Max’s, while John dies in the process. Knowing this, Jessica entrusts Kruger, to bring Max to Elysium and take control of the software, that could officially make her the President. Kruger, along with Max, Frey and her leukemia affected daughter, land in Elysium. Kruger suddenly turns against Jessica and kills her for an old time revenge and in the process tries to take control of Elysium, having coming to know of the deadly secret in Max’s brain.<br />Ultimately, Max overpowers Kruger physically, and allows Spider to reboot the entire software of Elysium, that grants its citizenship and access to Med Bay, to the entire population on Earth, sacrificing himself to the good cause. The movie comes to an emotional end when Max dies after the re-boot but saves the entire world.<br /><br />A movie that creates a kind of fear and doubts who watches it, as to what the future has in store for them, if they do not have enough money to get access to the technology that can give them a decent living. Who said money cannot buy anything? At least, it might be required to keep our children alive.<br />An excellent story, production and direction by Neill Blomkamp with a great cinematography, visual treat of possible futuristic machines, great sets, supplemented with star performance by Matt Damon (Max), Alice Braga (Frey), Sherlto Copley (Kruger) and sexy Jodie Foster (Jessica).
B000FC2L1E|4.0|the continuing saga of Diana Gabaldon's series takes you back in time and puts you directly in the story. Great fun.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King got this one right, there was no confusion about what he was writing, I used to follow his book all the time, and then his writing changed, so I stopped reading his works. This one is well written
0316228532|2.0|I was sad that this book was so negative.  Life can't always be an adventure or have a happy ending but this book is just depressing.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Very logically written.  This book was one of the most clearly written insofar as the deductions of the characters that I have ever read.  I was not able to guess Ted and that was very diverting.  Carrie seriously needed a spanking, but the human nature of what she did and how she behaved was very. Revealing of her nature.  Pendergast was at his finest and most human in the story and I can t remember feeling this good about him as a character
1419705644|5.0|My nephew is a HUGE adventure time fan and loved books so I thought this was perfect for him. The detail in the book is amazing and perfect for his birthday gift!

031623480X|4.0|Dr. David Perlmutter is an MD neurologist and fellow of the American College of Nutrition who has written prolifically: he knows a thing or two about the brain and nutrition.  As such, I was very excited to read his book Grain Brain and learn more about the connection between our obsession with carbohydrates and our brain health.  Personally, I know that I always have a foggy head after eating a carb heavy meal, and I wanted to know more about what is happening on a neurological level.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter begins by explaining the human body’s need for fat as fuel for the brain and how our fat phobic culture has actually created a situation where rates of heart disease, dementia, and diabetes have continued to increase despite the best efforts of our physicians, the FDA, and the government’s insistence that lowering cholesterol is one of the healthiest things we can do for ourselves and our society.  Many studies including the Framingham study (The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; Boston University, 2013)– the basis for most of our current heart disease prevention recommendations – have shown a connection between low cholesterol and premature death as well as dementia (David Perlmutter, 2013, pp. 34-35).  This shows us the importance of fats for brain function, but what about carbohydrates?<br /><br />Carbohydrates have only recently become the main players in our diet in recent history.  Prior to this, carbohydrates came in the form of roots, vegetables, seasonal fruits and berries, and small amounts of grain.  Loaves of bread were time consuming to make, Twinkies and soda were non-existent, and if you have read about a sugaring off in a Little House book, you know that candy and sugar were only consumed on special occasions if at all.  These days, in our western culture, one has access to all the blood sugar spiking carbohydrates they desire.  This leads to wide swings in insulin and blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and eventually diabetes.  The risk of Alzheimer’s disease doubles after the diagnosis of type II diabetes (David Perlmutter, 2013, pp. 86-87).  This link between diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease has led some neuroscientists to rename Alzheimers “Type 3 diabetes”.<br /><br />The next focus of the book centers on gluten and the havoc it can create in the brain.  In some patients with leaky gut, gluten is absorbed into the blood stream where it crosses the blood brain barrier and exerts an opiate-like effect on the brain – essentially drugging them.  It has also been well documented that children with learning and behavioral disorders have a much higher incidence of gastrointestinal disorders than the general population.  Dr. Perlmutter goes to far as to suggest that everyone should avoid gluten simply due to its effect on brain function, “[t]he removal of gluten form the diet and the adoption of a grain-brain-free way of life is often the surest ticket to relief for these brain ailments [common behavioral and psychological disorders] that plague millions, and this simple ‘prescription’ can often trump drug therapy.” (David Perlmutter, 2013, p. 150)  Anyone familiar with seizure disorders will recognize that a ketogenic (fat burning) diet has been used to control seizure activity in children and adults for decades.  The book goes on to showcase several cases studies where this prescription has worked to stabilize and remove the symptoms of depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.<br /><br />At the end of his book, Dr. Pearlmutter gives a great 4 week plan for helping the reader adjust to a new healthier lifestyle the removes inflammatory foods and adds in water and exercise.  Additionally, he gives a list of recommended supplements for brain health and laboratory testing that should be done prior to making your changes and after completing the four week plan.  Looking at the plan it is a bit reminiscent of the Atkins diet, but this plan does not bring you down to the lows of 20 grams of carbs per day, nor does it advocate eating deep fried meat wrapped cheese as individuals I know who were on the Atkins diet in the early 2000s were common to brag about eating.<br /><br />One caveat I have about this book, is the focus on the promotion of ketosis.  Yes, ketones are a product of the breakdown of fats, and the levels of ketones should be monitored - when ketosis occurs at high levels, it can be damaging to the kidneys and create unwanted side effects.  In the case of diabetic ketoacidosis, ketosis can also be life-threatening.  If you decide to experiment with the diet promoted by Grain Brain or any other low carbohydrate program, you should be aware of and watch for the side effects of ketosis: headache, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, and constipation (The Mayo Clinic, 2011).  Before making any large changes in your diet or exercise level, it is important to consult with your doctor, have a screening physical exam, and have basic blood work run to rule out any underlying conditions that may be worsened by your efforts to improve your health.<br /><br />Read and comment  at [...]<br /><br />Works Cited<br />David Perlmutter, M.

B009PNQUXO|3.0|this is a good software but time to time I need to delete manually the washed videos, this are holded and memory in my table until it is out of memory
B00GLK4OBO|4.0|With a 32 page booklet, I would have hoped for a track listing with linking narrative, with a few notes by Zimmer.  Instead we have two pages devoted to an editorial by Peter Asher, eight pages of un-captioned stills from the film, two pages of musicians credits, two pages of music credits, and 16 pages of mostly captioned photos from the sessions.  There is a track listing glued to the rear exterior, which will fit into the case after careful removal.  I simply see the packaging as lacking a total concept of a film/music account.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun!!!  Enjoy playing.  Can be maddening when stuck on a level, but very fun and addicting..  love playing it on my kindle, instead of my computer.  Lots of my friends play so easy to get lives.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The most poignant and powerful book on leadership I have ever read. Here was a man who was unafraid, and in fact embraced, what is sometimes called \\"healthy conflict\\". He literally appointed his political rivals to his cabinet. He encouraged dissenting opinions....some of which were passionately so...in the worst period of any country...civil war. Yet what was so remarkable, is after everyone had their say, he had the incredible courage to sometimes change his mind and agree with a different view, or respectfully thanked those around him and proceeded with what he believed was the right thing to do. This is a man who evolved from willing to support a constitutional amendment to preserve slavery in those states that already had it as a part of their economy and culture to preserve the Union, to the leader who penned the Emancipation Proclamation in his own hand. This book is not about the Civil War...or its cause...slavery...it is most of all about extraordinary and instinctive leadership that is in all too short supply today. No politician or company president should be allowed in position without reading this book.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Good flim, the concept  of a middle age superhero and how they deal with life in general is very interesting.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|If there is a book that is perhaps too powerful...this may be it. For those who may think Chris Kyle was a SEAL and sniper do him a great disservice and would miss the power in this story. Yes, Chris was an intense warrior and exceptional at his chosen craft, but the real story is told in the stories and remembering's of those family and friend who knew him best. Read that section of the book most carefully and one will be reminded of what once made this country great...and can again some day. He embodied so many of the qualities that make great friends...great. So perhaps from his story each of us can be a little bit better neighbor and friend...
B007VDN1PA|2.0|Hard to feed film and hard to take slides out of unit. Instructions could be better and unit lacks chip to transfer images to computer.
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|Funny funny funny  I was surprised I really liked this movie.  Laugh out loud and thought Aniston and Sudeikis did a great job and I keep wondering why she takes these movie roles.  Here I think she fits. There are some raunchy parts to the movie but I expected that.  I love the RV scenes in the movie and I think both actors playing the kids were good.  I think this is like a Griswold movie, updated to 2013.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Awesome! I love this game on facebook and zynga, so glad they made it for kindle fire HD! Now if they would only make a farmville  one I would be super happy!!
B00E00P5JC|4.0|My daughter and I saw this int he theater together. I laughed more through the beginning parts than she, but she loves watching it now at home. It's for kids, but there are enough funny moments to keep the adults happy.
B00FHB7398|1.0|Never would download. Still got charged for it. After four hours still showed as downloading. Very dissapointing. Wish i could get my money back.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|Great sound love her style of music mix between hip hop some soul and orchestra I guess would be the best way to put it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is fun and kinda addictive so if u like games like that then this game an it is time consuming so watch you clocks when playing this game
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|Fun movie, and great follow up to Monsters Inc. Although I was not really impressed with the 3D, I was very happy with the story.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Have been a huge fan of terraria on Xbox. I have been waiting months for It to come out on kindle. Now that terraria is finally portable it is one of my top two favorite games. It is two times better that minecraft pocket edition. It has many fun bosses to fight and it is impossible to win! There is no end! If you are an adventure battle mining type game guy- girl then you will like this alot.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Good action movie. I have heard people say they were not really impressed with this movie, but I really enjoyed it. The special effects were awesome, and it was just a great old fashion action flick. Good stuff!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the second book of the hunger games! It was great and awesome and even better than the first book!!
B005I64U5C|5.0|The first time I watched Green Lantern I was not impressed, but since then I have seen it 3 or 4 times and it has really grown on me. The special effects I really enjoy and the 3D is amazing. Plus my wife loves Ryan Reynolds so we have to watch this a LOT in my house.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About time! I love this game! I've waited so long for this to be available on the Kindle Fire. It was worth the wait.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie, and was so happy when they made this for 3D tv vs the crappy 3d green (or blue)and red glasses. This is just a fun movie that I can watch a few times a year and just really enjoy.
B0042816YK|3.0|I am a big fan of Julia Roberts but I must say this movie is average at best. The story is good and Julia's performance is great but the movie is not as great as I thought.
B008YUHQ3M|5.0|Loved the books loved the movies, wish they were all in 3D it does not add much but in a magical movie it adds just that little added flare. Series was so well written and then transitioned to movies so well.<br />If they remade the series in 3D I would be such a sucker and buy them all over again! I bought them in DVD, then again in blu-ray, so why not again in 3D
B002VCR03A|5.0|Big fan of Kristin Cashore books, am now on my third. Transports you to another world with believable, engaging characters and great pace. Highly recommend.
B008UZ7MUI|5.0|Loved the books loved the movies, wish they were all in 3D it does not add much but in a magical movie it adds just that little added flare.

B006MPKE9O|4.0|Beautiful language, intriguing characters, wonderfully imaginative and a beautiful story of love and life in Barcelona. What's not to like?
B00395ZYVS|5.0|As an adoptive mother for a child from India myself, this story touched my heart and gave me a new perspective from my child's point of view.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I am a Volbeat fan and the selection on this album are very interesting with a good driving sound. Shows some imagination in its selections and lyrics
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|This is a more mature, spiritually awakened TEN, The more I listen to it the more I like it. The 1st 5 or 6 songs give me that old PJ feeling I haven't felt since TEN. The western songs kind of through me off at first but they're growing on me. If you're a PJ fan you'll appreciate this album
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A great game.  Fun to play.  It takes time to learn how some of the more difficult levels work.  The little ones like playing it.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Set the alarm and it was so quiet that I slept through it.  I was not pleased with it at all.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Pathetic movie. Can't believe investors really spend so much money to put out something which is hard to believe. Can not suspend disbelief that much. How these two main characters are the ONLY ones to survive a major plane crash? etc. etc.<br />Brad pit should never have signed up to do this movie full of disgusting horror. I usually give movies reasonable reviews but this one does not deserve a pass - was a total waste of time and money. Don't bother- spare yourself and your friend and watch ANYTHING else.
0812550706|5.0|The book was great from beginning to end. If you love sci-fi, you'll like this book. Similar to the movie except even better because it has way more detail. Would highly recommend to all age groups.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Like the watch very much! We actually ended up asking a DMV officer to make a paracord watch strap for it.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Great actors. Henry Cavill did very well, in my opinion, playing Superman and I can't wait to watch the next one.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am retired and enjoy playing this game on my tablet, it's also a game that my grand daughter enjoys very much.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Food is good for the soul..... but hill climb racing is great for the soul mmmmmmmmm............yes yes yeast yes yes yes yes ...
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Fantastic and riveting story which takes you back and forth between two eras. It is a complex drama brought to life by the superb direction. Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs are a<br />masterpiece. I had seen the broadway version of it a long time ago and this movie just brought back my memories of it. A must buy for those who love musicals.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy playing this game a lot. It's challenging, but not frustrating. I would like to see more levels. I see it says coming soon, but how soon?
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Nonstop action, great CG, and good enough story line.  Honestly this movie ain't Citizen Kane but it is a great movie to watch.  Nothing too deep, just great action sequences.  Here's to hoping for a sequel.
B0015AARJI|5.0|good very good i used it almost everyday great buy very cheap too, recommend getting it thank you for the ps3 controller
B008M87GJK|4.0|BBC is my fall back to National Public Radio.  I like to hear about what is happening in the United States from the perspective of those who do not live here.  It is engaging and has fantastic interviews.  Between NPR and BBC I can get at the truth of what is happening that is found no where else.  They have not yet succumbed to sound bites and entertainment television and I hope they never do.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|It works. It is mechanical and the back is clear so you can see the workings.  I have bought a number of Seikos over the years, and prefer the automatics.
0977476073|4.0|Bought as a gift and the person loved it.  The person wanted to understand why Hitler did what he did.  I hope he found out by reading this book.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Absolutely Great!  Saw it on Channel-13 and bought the Blue-Ray because I had to see it again. Hitchcock swings back and forth between the believable and unbelievable and really gives you something to look at all the way through.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I was gagging during the first few chapters when Clary still kept mooning over Jace and his perfect hair. I skimmed through those paragraphs and concentrated on the other aspects of the story. We finally met Sebastian who is a worthy antagonist and I was so relieved that the author finally revealed that Clary & Jace aren't related at all. But of course, Clary just had to kiss Sebastian too, which is also disturbing. UGH. Anyways, Clary is not the main reason I've been reading this series, since the other characters in the book made it more interesting than her. I'm glad that Jocelyn is finally awake and Luke finally had the courage to tell her how he felt. I definitely loved the last chapters of this book and how fast- paced it was with the shadowhunter-downworlder-demon battles. I also loved how Valentine was handled, talk about sweet justice. I'm going to read the next one to see if Sebastian survived.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Just had no depth like the first Superman.  On and on with fight too fast to see and too much!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Just started playing and I haven't come across a anything that's too much of a hassle yet there is some in app purchasing but it's not outrageous and so far I've not had to buy anything to continue playing the game but as with all these games that could be an issue later but it's been smooth sailing so far.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Dumb, just dumb!  There was no real point to any of it and difficult to understand when the plot developed.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this game so far!! Still waiting to buy land, and when you run out of crowns I wish you could buy them with yours coins!
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|Perhaps if I hadn't already seen Olympus has Fallen it may have been better but it was almost exactly the same but a little less believable.
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|This show is so well written and acted.  It is side splitting funny.  If you haven't seen this show start from the beginning and watch all of the episodes.
B00CXLQG0M|4.0|Bought it for my niece for Christmas. She usually gets jealous whenever us guys in the family play nerf tag in the house and she feels left out. Now? She's deadlier than Annie Oakley at a shooting range.
B00B2QA646|2.0|Purchased because my Aunt was visiting us to recover from surgery and really wanted to see this movie.  Couldn't find it for rent anywhere so I purchased.  We couldn't get past the middle of this movie, it was strange and difficult to make sense out of.  I may try it again when I've got nothing else to do, but I would that you wait until this title is free to watch somewhere before giving it a go.  Otherwise, Amazon's instant video service works extremely well and we have used it often to rent or purchase a missed episode of a favorite show.  I recommend Amazon's service, but not this movie!
B007PVHANM|4.0|Great movie to add to a music DVD collection lots of footage and facts I didn't know about Marley before
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|one of the best that you need in your kindle. there are a lot of missions and a lot of characters.  take this for fun
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have the Kindle edition of this book.  A good thing, because I was able to retrieve it and read it a second time just a few weeks ago.  I do love the way Stephen King writes!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I will not have any spoilers in this review.<br /><br />Only warning: I am a fanatic fan of A Song of Ice and Fire series, a new convert to the world of fantasy fiction and mad about George RR Martin's language, writing voice, characters, story telling, dialogue, and most of all, genius imagination.<br /><br />This is the 3rd book in the series and I have read the first 2 and loved both. I don't care what people say about books 4 & 5. I can't wait to devour them. I would be happy to stay lost in Westeros forever!<br /><br />And I swear it by the old gods and the new ;), I have decided this is the BEST - single BEST - book I've read in my life and I've read a lot of books. Every character POV makes you see the world in a new lens, it's never black or white. It's never what you think, it's impossible to guess (and I'm good at guessing!!) and every page and every character is a gate into a new world.<br /><br />Most of all, I love LOVE the language, the words that Martin creates, here are some of my favorites:<br />Blood of my blood.<br />Smallclothes.<br />Make water.<br />My sun and stars, my moon and stars.<br />A mummer’s farce.<br />Khaleesi.<br />Like nipples on a breastplate.<br />What in seven hells.<br />My blood riders<br />Halfman, imp, dwarf.<br />The seven take  you/him.<br />Winter is coming.<br />Gods be good.<br /><br />You know what's funny? I am new to the world of fantasy fiction and a big fan of The Lord of the Rings stories, but this is where my pulse quickens. With Martin's story telling. With his incredible characters, his stunning prose, and his shocking twists and turns. They are deep too. This is not on-the-surface kind of action that bores me to tears. This is a world within a world and it intrigues you, it challenges you, and it saddens you too. Because it's good. It is really really THAT good.<br /><br />A Song of Ice and Fire has changed my experience and relationship with books and fiction, and here I thought I had a pretty good one to begin with. Read them. They're worth all 8000 or so pages! Off to book 4 for me. Hope you enjoyed my ranting ;)!gin with. Read them. They're worth all 8000 or so pages! Off to book 4 for me. Hope you enjoyed my ranting ;)!
B00992CF6W|5.0|0.8.0 will probably be out around the end of November, this was stated by tomasco so we will be getting minecarts soon
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it. it is so fun to play I play it all day and I play it all night long I love it....................ha ha ha its fun
B0069GRIHW|5.0|You get two cd's,one which the public received, and #2 which has the band members talking about the songs between takes. As a former musician I enjoyed the banter between band members that lead to the final takes that makes this the best songs The Doors ever released. The songs are fantastic, and you get the feeling you were in the studio with them and part of the all too short history of this amazing band.
B00BATG18K|1.0|I loved Amy Tan's previous novels, and was so excited when her new one came out! To be honest, I am on page 100, and I am wondering if I will get any further...boring! Contrived! Repetitive....it  has been an effort to get this far...I am so disappointed! I know that several women in my book club feel the same way...and when there are so many other books on my reading list, I I have to admit it is tempting to just end it here!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Martin has succeeded in maintaining the energy of the first novel in this series, and he has successfully added new narrators to take over the threads for the narrators we have lost. My favorite character continues to be Tyrion Lannister, whose answer to Stannis Baratheon's attack on King's Landing reveals his ingenuity. Martin's careful handling of this character reveals, too, that Tyrion is fully aware of the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />Martin is teetering on an edge, however. The danger of having multiple narrators is that the story may bog down under the weight of so many storylines. The author veers dangerously in this direction by having so many chapters end without having had a significant turning point. The constant vulgarity of some of the minor characters is getting a little tedious as well. On the whole, though, Martin has increased the breadth of his story and gotten his characters involved in some very interesting dilemmas.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|I am a huge fan of these games and when I downloaded this one I was surprised by the differences. Instead of getting bored waiting right away I got to complete several quests and go up a few levels. The only thing that would break my heart is if it freezes and forces me to download the game and lose all my info like The Tribez... My worst nightmare. Lol.<br /><br />And my worst nightmare came true. The game is frozen on an update screen and the update doesn't exist so I can't play the game since it won't allow me to play without the nonexistent update. Grrrrr. These are the worst possible games for this to happen with, I now have no desire to replay up to level 16. :-(
0441013597|5.0|One of the greatest books--not just SF books--of all time. This book has everything--a great story, sympathetic and complex characters, an incredibly realized landscape, and an underlying philosophy that changes your view of the world. The contrast between a human and an animal, which Paul Atreides learns in the very first chapter, is not just a guiding theme in the book but a lesson about humanity. And that's only a small piece of what this book holds for the careful reader.
0345803485|5.0|Hot Hot Hot! This is just the spice to fix your appetite for erotic romance! I'd recommend purchasing all three to read one after the other!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I finally got around to this book and am so glad I did.  I love getting the outsiders view of the weirdness of America.  The characters are diverse and original and deep.  Plus, Neil Gaiman is just a brilliant writer - he sucks you in and takes you for a ride.
B00571F26Y|2.0|While Davis certainly put a lot of research into this book, it seemed like he started with a hypothesis and did all his research to prove that theory - rather than seeing where the research would lead on its own. While wheat can certainly cause serious issues, and while people with celiac disease or diabetes certainly need to avoid wheat products, it is not the enemy for every single person. Some of us thrive by including wheat in our diets.<br /><br />It's like saying: if you cross the street, you may get hit by a car; therefore you should never cross the street unless you want to commit suicide. Yes, some of his claims are that ludicrous.<br /><br />Also, it seemed like many of his studies were based on people who consumed far too many starchy calories anyway - it's no wonder they profited from avoiding wheat, because naturally it would lower their caloric intake and force them to eat something better than over-processed &#34;junk&#34; food! However, look at someone who already eats something like a Mediterranean-style diet, and is happy with their weight and health... there's no reason for that person to avoid wheat products.<br /><br />I read this for an assignment, not for fun, and while I try to be very open-minded and love researching nutrition... I would never recommend this book to anyone other than someone with celiac disease. And that's only because I don't know other better resources to recommend.
B0093X805W|5.0|This classic book still works for kids today.  In fact, there are only a couple of things (the price of the candy bar and the size/shape of the TV) that reveal the age of the book.  My 4th grade son, who is not a super book fan, really enjoyed it and picked it for his book club.  He had seen the movie a few years previously, so I was afraid it might spoil the story, but it did not.  If anything, it made him more excited to keep reading as he remembered bits and pieces and wanted to read them.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I chose this rating because of the outstanding writing style and craft. Its  unique point of view and elaborate use figurative language make for an unforgettable read. Classic is written all over it.
B00CIR97UW|5.0|This is a new gem of Simon Singh. A pleasant and thorough investigation about how it has become the Simpsons series. Highly recommended.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Love the convergence of the three stories, and did not expect it to end how it did. Easy and quick read where I couldn't put it down.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I am enjoying the game. Everything seems to work well but earning crowns is a bit of a problem. Over all though I like it. I have already stayed up way to late playing it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love games like this and it's a cute version and fun for all ages. I would Definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book that I have read by this author.  It moved along easily and had many twists that were well hidden.  I enjoyed this book and will look forward to reading more from this author.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Best game I have this on my Xbox 360 and this is not a scam the people who say it's a scam its fake. ITS REAL PEOPLE.NOT A SCAM.Just like minecraft too. So I would bye this app it's awesome BYYYYYYYYYYYYY
B00112HZEA|5.0|I have to say writing several reviews in a row of Schleich barn animal figures gets boring, because every one of them is such a high quality - heavier weight than most toy animal figures, and with super detail. This Holstein Calf is no exception.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|What is there to say? This is one of the greatest films to ever be made in the history of movies.
B005ERYEGU|5.0|Simple to read and understand. Things I think about or know intuitively but may not put into practice because they are not in the front of my mind. This book helps bring them to the front of my mind so I can put them into practice deliberately. These are not \\"pie-in-the-sky\\" types of concepts they're very basic, but very powerful when implemented.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Gift for the daughter who loves this movie and soundtrack.  She is very happy with this gift from her mom.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Because I can't find any other books or series that's as good as the Fever series!<br />It answered all of the aching questions that were built up throughout the series and I absolutely loved the focus on Mac and Barrons. :]
0307887960|5.0|This diet plan was introduced to me by a co-worker and it really does give one the tools to be successful at loosing the unhealthy weight.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was a good mystery. I read it waiting to find out why the main character had done what he did with all his money! Great read!!!!
B00E9A656K|5.0|The best online racing game out there in my eyes!! Just wish we would get more than 1 coin each time we level up?!?!?! That's my only complaint about the game
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fantastic! I literally unpacked this and in less than 30 minutes it was up and running and I was casting from Netflix. So much better than everyone squeezing around the laptop to watch things! Can't speak to casting from other sites and services, but I'm just looking to stream Netflix for now and it does this perfectly and easily!
B008RTE066|5.0|This box set, Folks. This is one of my most favorite Beatles items I own. This is what it comes with:<br />Magical Mystery Tour Ticket: Weakest part of the box set,but still a nice addition<br />Book: Very resourceful and helpful in learning about the production of the Magical Mystery Tour movie<br />DVD/Blu Ray: Contains the movie. Great movie<br />EPs- This is why I wanted it. The replicas are awesome and a good listen. Here are the songs:<br />Magical Mystery Tour: Catchy song that sticks in your brain.<br />Flying: Most people hate this song, but personally its a relaxing instrumental<br />I am the Walrus: My favorite song in this. Doesn't need an explanation of why it's good.<br />Your Mother Should Know: Probally my least favorite, but still it's a catchy song<br />The Fool on the Hill: Good song with interesting lyrics describing... well a fool<br />Blue Jay Way: One of my favorite Harrison songs. His voice is soothing and the lyrics are easy to remember.<br /><br />You gotta buy this piece. It's amazing!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great device. I have two. One at work and one at home. Its great for reviewing you tube videos on your iOS device first before pushing to the TV. you can even review while there is one playing. I think it's great that once you start playing a Netflix movie that it doesn't drain your mobile device. It seems to find the stream directly from the Chromecast device and even if I turn off my iPad, the movie continues on so don't worry about it draining your battery. Waiting for it to do more things like share the screen of the mobile device but they seem to be adding more and more. Setup was very simple using an app from the app store. I like it as it's nice to allow everyone to see you tube on the TV rather than crowding around you and the ability to control it from the mobile device is nice.
B000002GFC|5.0|Cream is one of classic rocks best group. If you love classic rock from a classic group then you will love this CD!
159562015X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and using the tools to get to know more about myself. It's a unique approach to personality types.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Rock at its best!! If you are a big Who fan, then this is the Cd for you! They simply Rock!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Amazing keyboard mod, the only downside is it does not include Pinyin or Traditional Chinese in their language list... yet.
B001CNFZEK|5.0|I have always loved Santana throughout the years and if you love them too, then you will simply love this Cd!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I've only had this game for a day, but am totally loving it! I need a few neighbors so please add me. My id is FAVNULV
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I cant install this on my app device. I have a Kindle Fire first edition. It sounds like a cool premise but nay nay
B00DM0YE9S|2.0|I didn't fall asleep, but this movie was a little slow.  I like Ed Harris and that's what kept me watching.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|What a great way to organize email!  Now if only I could have custom tabs that would really be awesome.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like this alarm clock. Its simple to use and you can pick your own wake up tone from your music collection. Basic but good.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really cool and kinda addictive but not really but again this is from a kid but my opinions are true so consider this before you go buying this all Willy nilly and takin up space in your device for nothing and guys yes it's true candy crush is on kindle fire I've been waiting in this for one whole year bye!!!!:)
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Keeps you on the edge just waiting for what will happen next.  I have not watched the series on tv so not sure how it compares with the books.
B0007OASII|5.0|Thank you it was shipped fast and it arrived here fast as well, I love your gift wrapping so you win a cookie so I applaud you with a job well done. (I'm trying to pretend to be elegant not my personality at all.) anyway I'm gonna make so she almost can't open her gift  it will be fun to see them try to open there gift for 10 minutes HAHAHA!
0061714402|5.0|Metalica may not have evolved into one of the world's most recognisable heavy metal acts, if not for this guy.
B0054JELS4|5.0|Totally my favorite show, I had bought season 9 separate but what a deal this was, only wish I had looked before I bought that one.
1451620829|5.0|As one of the original members of the worlds most famous masked men, Peter Criss (drummer of KISS) tells how his street wise upbringing in Brooklyn, New York paved the way for his eventual success in one of the biggest Rock band's the world has ever seen.  I couldn't put this book down.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|started off a little slow, but became more gripping by the chapter. a very sad reflection on the cruelties that humans can impose on each other. definitely a recommended reading
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is one of my favorites.  You can see the images in your mind.  Every time you read it your arena takes shape.
B00G9QLP9Y|5.0|Very fast, accurate, detailed maps.  Easy to use... just put in an address and then click on &#34;Find Location&#34;.  Can zoom in or out with simple hand swipes.  Suggestion: I wish this app would allow maps to be saved on my android tablet for future use so it could be prepared in advance and then used when travelling even when WIFI isn't subsequently available.  Nevertheless, this is already a great app for anyone who travels a lot and can find WIFI hot spots while roaming around.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really love this game, I started playing it on Facebook and was so glad that it came to the kindle. My only  dilemma is that when I try to connect to Facebook it tell me that k can't connect to the kingdom right now try later please  can someone tell me why we can't connect to Facebook.
B002UEW31I|5.0|A classic movie.  Brad Pitt is terrific and Christoph Waltz is absolutely brilliant.  Tarantino's legendary attention to detail, and the superb script and acting make this a movie you want to return to again and again.  Recommended!
B00A80SHFM|2.0|The quality of the CD itself seems fine, but the CD wasn't what I wanted.  The key, apparently, is that it's &#34;highlights from&#34; the soundtrack.  This means that it does NOT have all the songs, including some that, in my opinion, are pretty important, such as &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing?&#34; and &#34;Lovely Ladies.&#34;  This is partially my fault for not looking more carefully, but I do wish it had been clearer that this was just a partial soundtrack.  Had I known that it was missing several songs, I would have paid the higher price for the complete soundtrack.  Now, though, I'm stuck with this, because situations like this apparently aren't covered by Amazon's return policy.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Jeremy Renner is terrific but this installment of the Bourne series for some reason is not as engaging as the previous three.  This is not a movie I might want to watch again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this on a whim, not really sure what it was.  I love that it makes me think.  Oddly enough, my six year old has gotten hooked on it, and I have noticed that the more she plays it, and the higher she gets in levels, the better her critical thinking skills are getting.  She's learning more to anticipate moves and problem solve.  I see her competitive drive sneaking in where she is trying harder and harder to have a &#34;perfect&#34; game.  Very simple concept, but a great brain teaser!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Because I cannot download the app, therefore I cannot give a rating of more than this. How do I get help.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Love this movie and have watched it a couple times over.  Trials of growing up and wanting to be different.
0920668372|5.0|I have 18months old son.<br />I bought it for him. But before he could read or understand, that book had become mine....<br />This should be parents to read as well as their children.<br /><br />I cried every time I read it..<br />It's a wonderful book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicting.  Thanks for releasing it on the Kindle.  Plays seemlessly and easy on the platform.  Fun game. Thanks King.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The movie was better. I didn't know the book would be written like it is. It's like a bunch of short stories from differant people. Not a big fan.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like the casting from my PC. Unfortunately I have an ipad so not much I can do with it. It needs a remote control
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Only dislike is there`s no way to get Glu coins I n any quantity through the fan  itself. There should be a way to earn coin without having to get cheats or spending real cash to get virtual!
0321525655|4.0|&#34;DEATH BY POWERPOINT&#34; YES!!!! If there is one pet peeve that bothers me most, it's sitting in a presentation with slides full of words and more words. If your presentation did not catch me in the beginning, I'm most likely zoned out by the time you make it to the 3rd slide. Reynolds gives ideas and examples on how to make simple slides with meaning. I think 2 of the most valuable points that I found in this book were how to use pictures effectively in slides, and remembering the 3 parts of a presentation: The slides, your notes, and audience take a way material.<br /><br />I personally found this book to be tough read but is definitely ideal for public speaking/ communication courses.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Great series if you like government and the law.  For some reason when this ran on TV I didn't watch it.  But now with the DVD series I've watched it several times and have not tired of it yet.  A good book is never dull or boring so are good TV series.
1576754227|5.0|I put the &#34;PRO&#34; in procrastinate. This book has given me a different look on how to take on each day by dealing with the most dreaded tasks first. With a mix of time management ideas, this short read is ideal for the person who doesn't want the long drawn out method to self-help. One of the most valuable points that I found in this book was the ABCDE method. A- Most critical tasks that have to be completed. B- task that should be done but don't have consequences as critical as A tasks. C- tasks that have no consequences at all (i.e. paying your bills during lunch). D- Tasks that can be delegated to someone else. E-Tasks that can be eliminated from the list. I will say that after reading this book, I felt motivated when I walked into the office the next day.<br /><br />If you are looking for an addition to your library that you can use to quickly refer to when needed, I suggest obtaining a copy for yourself. I also suggest that you do not read straight through without fully grasping the information in each chapter. Take Notes! I did!
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|Very enjoyable  not hard or easy. I really love puzzle games so this was right up my alley. Helped to pass the time.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|One of the best movies of the Century so far.  I can't wait for the sequels.  I really love the combo and have utilized all three versions. Hopefully, one day, UltraViolet and its menage á Flixter and Vudu will work out to be a remarkable, affordable place to store movies on the Cloud.  This box has great artwork and design, and it's hard to beat those.  I wish all BDs were this generous.<br /><br />Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara...if you haven't seen this yet, WHAT are you waiting for?
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Handy and extremely neat clock app. So simple to view and use even a caveman can operate it! Very nice,well designed and functional.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Top 5 shows of all time:<br />1.  Breaking Bad<br />2.  Sopranos<br />3.  Mad Men<br />4.  Downton Abbey<br />5.  Six Feet Under
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|Great game but it's held back by the pay to play system. The only way to unlock weapons and armor is either countless hours of playing or real world money.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|The app looks smooth and appealing. The problem comes in when you try to add content. I tried for weeks to access Feedly but, when google reader shut down Feedly crashed from the added traffic and made this app useless.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game has a great story, beautiful graphics for this type of game, and with no adds this game has a very strong performance. I can't wait to see more games like this released by Amazon for the fire.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|Grand daughter loves Sophia and family.  She has a box full of other little Disney characters.  This is going to be part of her Christmas present.  I already know it will be a hit.  Not a day goes by her other Disney characters don't come out of their box to encourage her imaginary play.  She has other Sophias in the box.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I'm all about the comic book movies and this did not disappoint. Much better than 1995 film with Stallone. If you love comic book action films, you should watch this
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The most beautiful book that I have read since Night.  It's  beauty lies in its simply story of risking to love and its care for words.
0553573403|2.0|It's fine I honestly just can't get into it.  I'm around 3/4s of the way through and I just can't seem to force myself to care about any of the characters.  Which is especially odd for me because I normally love flawed characters (I absolutely adore Hamlet) and I love the fact that his female characters are given as much depth as the males, an almost impossible find in a lot of fantasy novels.  I am honestly not even sure why I don't like the novels, I love Tolkien and I do enjoy epic fantasy but there's just something about it that I can't put my finger on exactly.  Maybe it's how often you switch characters around, especially with how deep they are, it is hard to get to know any one character fully and if you don't know them you can't care about them.  And when I say care about I do not mean like, I do not have to like a person but I do have to care about what happens to them.  I need to feel something in regards to the character it can be despise, love, like, or even confusion but never indifference.  I need your help, if I have gotten this far and it hasn't pulled me in should I keep reading it?
0345803485|5.0|Steamy! Didn't want to put it down and couldn't wait to read the next book! I suggest you order all three at one time!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|The absolute most perfect and user friendly radio app hands down. Far exceeded expectations after downloading. Highly recommended ahead of any other
B008LODRT8|5.0|I was so sad that this was the last book. You get into the characters that you don't want the story to end.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|I've just started reading comic and this is the best storyline I've read in a very long time. I can't believe I passed up on comics before
0345803493|5.0|I really enjoyed the E.L. James trilogy of Fifty Shades.  It was very difficult to put down.  I suggest buying all three at one time so you don't have to wait for the next book to arrive.
B0049A9BSY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it's SEX IN THE CITY!  I believe I'll love anything having to do with this show and these actors.<br />I really enjoyed the special features especially the Behind-the-Scenes!<br /><br />I'll be waiting for Sex in the City lll ;-)
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|Awesome music! Very upbeat and fun.  Most of this music is useful for ballroom dancing. Caro has a delightful voice and great way of phrasing the lyrics.
B00DI75SWM|1.0|The icons at the top of the generator are way too small. Basically that's the main issue I have with it. The variety of icons are great, but I decided to delete the program because of the inability to size the icons as large as the fonts.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|THIS I  THE BEST GAME EVER GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND THE STORY TO IT IS GENIUS.<br />READ THIS REVIEW TO BECOME A OWNER OF THIS GAME
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Why can't I update to the new fb? There isa tab where you can update status feelings and it's not on my FB..
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This is a great selection form one of the most popular entertainers of the 90's. Each song is Garth Brooks at his best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When r u guys gonna make pet rescue saga available for the kindle fire????? I am so excited that u finally made candy crush saga available.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book finally answers why the low-carb diets work-- and why you feel so much better when you cut the carbs-- it's the high gluten content hidden in the carbs!  My wife and I have been on it for ten days and feel amazing.  Excess weight is disappearing.  The recommended supplements are cheap at Walmart.  You have to read this book and try it!
0399536108|4.0|I first checked out this book from the library, but after getting about half way through it, I realized that I wanted it for my own library. Yes, there are a million and one, &#34;Make your life what you want of it&#34; books, but I think this one does a nice job challenging what society might have you think you want and what you really want and need to establish what you yourself determine success is. Plus, the &#34;Change The World&#34; part isn't something you often see in other books - nice to see a book that realizes that part of our happiness lies in helping others.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|Great mystery but not the traditional kind.  The more I read the more I wanted to read.  It is a very interesting style and held my attention through out.
006202406X|2.0|Absolute let down to a series that I eagerly awaited. Like many other reviews, books 1 and 2 had their weaker points, but book 3? Wow. I wish I had just stopped at book 2 so then I could at least have imagined something better then what was presented. The characters didn't fit with who they were in the previous two books, the writing wasn't great and things dragged on. So disappointed. Can't understand what happened to Ms. Roth with this one...
B001V9LPY4|5.0|Please please please get this movie to Blu-ray, Ive been waiting a long time too! Its my favorite animated movie. Very entertaining.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I thought the Cinamatography was great, the movie had very interesting costume design, and Jennifer Lawrence is awesome.  I can't wait to see the sequal.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have read this trilogy at least 20 times in the past week. A good mix of everything, but having a special touch, I recommend this book to everyone
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|This may be the best screen adaptation ever of a Shakespearian play. The dialog is clear and the acting is on point.
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|I really had low expectations about another superman movie. All the Marvel movies and the latest in updated Batman's set the bar not to mention the Star Trek set.<br /><br />I think they did a nice job of giving more back story and the bonus features really help. I was a big time comic book fan back in the late 60's and through to the mid 70's. Much more of a Marvel Super hero fan.<br /><br />After 26+ years as an Analytical Chemist (needless to say), if there is anything in a SciFi that seems unsound scientifically, I spend the whole rest of the movie calculating out how that could be possible. Too many of those in a move and I'm done.<br /><br />Yea, I know all SciFi nuts do the same thing.<br /><br />I really don't want to give anything away in this review, so all I'm going to say is, I bought the movie and watched it twice back to back then again the next day with the kids.<br /><br />I think the \\"movie going experience\\" just bumped up the bar again. Marvel's going to have to work on there story line more and not just put more and more flying Iron Man suits on the screen.<br /><br />Iron Man was my Super hero as a kid, but Iron III tried it's best to kill it for me. It lost out big time to Star Trek II. I think \\"Man of Steel\\" jumped a full pace out front to me.<br /><br />Great job, More please..........
B00114RKT8|5.0|Great collaboration -including acting, script, production, historicity & even theologically accurate!  A must see for champions of freedom and justice!
B0068THAGY|5.0|I really loved this movie. It's nothing like a Super Man, Bat Man, Star Trek, Iron Man, Thor........that I fall out the door in a frenzy to go see .It has a real believable story line. It's not a ET phone home movie ether (that caused a gag reflex half way through). It is full of kid actors, but meant somewhat more for the adults.<br /><br />No Spoiler here, so I say a great story line SciFi ( time period is \\"kids get out of the house and go do something type movie\\"). For Adults that had grown up in the 70's and 80's, I get the feeling you can more relate. Maybe it just me,
B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|As reviewer 320Flyer pointed out, this is a great little machine for running XBMC via OpenElec.  I actually followed his lead and bought the same 2GB DDR3 memory & Belkin notebook power cord and paired that up with a 16GB USB stick that I had + I purchased the &#34;New Edition HP OEM Windows Media Center MCE PC Remote Control with infrared receiver right here on Amazon.  I have the Harmony One universal remote control so I really only needed the IR receiver but the remote came in handy as I used the IR &#34;learn&#34; function within the Harmony software for a couple of the buttons.  So for about $220 I have a great little HTCP as OpenElec runs right off the 16GB USB stick and I have a 2TB external HD connected via one of the available USB ports where I keep all my media.  Everything is working good so far, full bluray ISO rips play smoothly (although I noticed that you need to have &#34;hardware acceleration&#34; enabled within XBMC, otherwise bluray HD movies stutter) I am even able to put the NUC to &#34;sleep&#34; and wake it up via my harmony remote so there is virtually zero &#34;boot&#34; up time when I select XBMC as an &#34;activity&#34; on my remote.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Yes I Loved it... I was a 70's Marvel comic fan with Iron Man as my favorite comic hero. The movie lets each hero and villain have equal show time and works each-ones super power or talents to make the team work and believable.<br />Overall quality of the cgi was great that let you focus on the story line and not flaws in the technology of filming.<br /><br />Lots of fun and action, great job.<br /><br />Only compliant is, I think we need longer Stan Lee scenes.
0525478817|5.0|I can only say that this book has entered and will not likely exit my top-ten list.  I read it in a day because I couldn't put it down, so adept is the characterization of these lovely people, and so moving the story.
1400069289|4.0|Very good book with insight on what drives our daily doings. It can take a lot of work to change habits but very worth the effort to develop great ones.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|This game is loads of fun for people who love hidden object games with a mystery, story line twist. I was a fan of Mystery Man, but Mirrors of Albion is far more engaging. I love the characters and graphics!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This app won't stop downloading on my Kindle Fire. It downloads then downloads then again and keeps doing it. I just want it removed at this point. So frustrating. I deleted it from Amazon's page and from the kindle.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Far too many stupid plot points. I get that this is fiction, but the aliens are idiots. They couldn't create the technology they did, cross vast distances and still be that stupid.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Very sleek case.  Fits nicely into my pockets.  Looks great, nice colors.  If you don't need a  bunch of protection for your IPhone this is a great case.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is my first book of Ms. Tartt's and I can wrap this up with one word; Wow.  Excellent writing!  Philosophical, moderately morose, yet uplifting of spirit and heart, and circling inevitably back to love and the relationships with others that sustain us throughout our lives.  A sheer work of art!  Bravo Ms. Tartt!!  I'm off to check out your other books.....
0316204366|5.0|This is a very inspiring book!  While the stories are compelling and instructive, I was almost as intrigued to learn that Malcolm Gladwell, who lives in NYC, is a Mennonite-- a religion I ordinarily associate with the country.  Confessing to being religious is the last coming-out for a liberal, and acknowledging membership in a smaller, less fashionable sect seems very brave to me.  (I am a member of a smaller, less fashionable sect too).
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I cannot say enough about this show. The lead actors all deserve emmys. The writers are brilliant and the acting superb
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is sooo goood! It my be complicated, but the puzzles are very complicated. I just finished chapter one, and i rate this 1,000,000,000 ducks outta 10.DGFGRJDDFGRWJPDCPANDOTHERS.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|My measly words cannot describe the excellence of this show... There was not one dull episode. From the first episode to the finale... spot on.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|A fun game for anyone snd easy enough not to get frustrated.  Waiting for things to h a ppen builds patience.  Wish the helpful hints were a bit more helpful. forcing the use of gems at the outset is not a nice feature..
B00EKR61FM|4.0|Can't go wrong with this box set. It has every extra feature they ever did and some new ones. The packaging is cool too, and it comes with digital codes. I'm only concerned the way its packaged may scratch the discs.
B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Right on target...! From the opening track right on through to the last track. This album is no let down
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I'm so sad it's over. I could watch 10 more seasons of this show. A great display of excellent TV without the use of excessive gore, nudity or cursing. Sure there was a little of each but it added to the show, never took away or was too distracting.

B000FC12C8|4.0|As a classic investment book this one is pretty good at l a young out the basics.  At times a bit redundant but it makes up for that by having some entertainment value.  A lot of good information and illustrative examples.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|Keeps crashing my Kindle fire as the game will freeze up and then I will have to do a hard revolt. otherwise a fun game. please improve it and I will be back.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|Love this CD. Love beth. She is an amazing singer adn this cd hits on all her capabilities. Great vendor!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I’m always thrilled to see another new Pendergast novel. WHITE FIRE delivers a complex plot that twists several mysteries together for entertaining reading. Without a doubt, Preston and Child are my favorite writing team and Pendergast is my favorite fictional character. With each book I know I’ll get intelligent writing, vivid descriptions that immerse the reader in each scene, and stellar dialogue from Special Agent Pendergast. I loved this book! Was it my favorite in the series? No, that honor goes to Fever Dream, but I do think I’ll go back and read it again as I have most all of the Pendergast novels.<br /><br />Also, of all the secondary characters in the series, Corrie Swanson is my favorite. She gets to shine in this novel (although sometimes I wanted to scream at the decisions she made). Loved the ending and can’t wait for the next in the series.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game. Graphics are great when I'm not in the woods this is the game I play. Had this on my tablet now playing on my kindle

B00DXPC1U6|4.0|Is it one of the best seasons of Dexter? Oh, heck no. But is it really as bad as everyone is making it out to be? NO. I just think most people today only want to see movies/TV shows with lots of action and thrills, with as little dialogue as possible. Which is a shame. It's as if people only have the mental energy to 'see' and not 'think'. Yes, this season was a chatty one, and in my honest opinion, I felt it was refreshing and eye opening. I mean, we have 7 seasons of lots of entertaining kills and suspense, so what is wrong with 1 season of Dexter battling with his emotions (cont.) but actually TALKING about it? I loved how they dove into the psychology behind Dexter and Debra and their relationship. I was hooked until the very end, and in the back of my mind, I couldn't believe how poorly people responded to this season. Can I understand why people hated the series finale? Yeah, I can.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />I was actually okay with the execution of Dexter's and Debra's goodbye. I bawled my eyes out. I can't recall the last time I cried so hard. Honestly, as much as I hated that Debra died, I found it fitting, because of LaGuerta's death. Now, I know deep inside Debra was a good person, and she didn't deserve to die. But... neither did LaGuerta. So, it was unfortunate but... it balanced it out, in my honest opinion. PLUS, it is one of the tragic, but expected, consequences of being a serial killer and having those you love close to you. I could also dive into Dexter's and Debra's actions, and lack thereof, and their consequences but that would take forever. For example, had Debra never mentioned anything about Hannah... or had Dexter just went ahead and killed The Brain Surgeon... Blah, blah, blah. You get the picture. That's life. You do something or don't do something, ANYTHING can happen.<br /><br />I was okay with Dexter driving his boat into the hurricane. I was expecting him to die, and I was honestly hoping for that to happen. He had went through so much emotional, mental and physical turmoil. Plus, a lot of good people died, all being tied somehow to Dexter. So, it made sense for him to die, or least to stay far away, so that nothing bad would follow him, because eventually Hannah and Harrison would receive the same fatal fate as Debra's. (More on that in a bit.)<br /><br />My issues with the series finale is that they didn't really close anything up with the rest of the beloved characters. They were just sort of left hanging in the air with no real conclusion or resolution. It was like, &#34;Ok, well, that sucks for them.&#34; and then onward to this and that. I feel the characters deserve more respect than that. A more concrete finality. I mean, yeah, Debra just died and they're thinking Dexter is dead, too. ...but that's it. Moving on, apparently. I wanted to know: What will be in their future? In that time period, what do they let go of? What do they hold onto? What are they gonna do? Or at least try to do? Even the slightest indication would have been better than nothing.<br /><br />Also, we learn that Dexter survived the hurricane. Ok, fine. Sure. Whatever. So he ends up being a lumberjack in Oregon. I'm on the fence about it, actually. It feels really random, in my honest opinion. They couldn't have thought of Dexter doing anything else? But... I do understand Dexter wanting to be in isolation and staying as far away as possible from those he cared about. It was a sad, tragic ending for him. Well, everyone basically. Honestly, though, I think he should have just died in the hurricane. He should have died and be with Debra in the ocean. But that's just me.<br /><br />I know, it's a crappy review but... it's wicked late and I'm wicked tired and I'm just writing what stuck out the most for me. I do think it was a great season, not the best, and that the series finale definitely needed more work. I just think people are really upset because, well, it's the final episode. There is no turning back. They can't do another season and fix their mistakes. It's done. But... looking at the entire series as a whole, looking at it big picture wise, it is a spectacular show and I gladly own every single season with pride. I LOVE this show. So sad to see it go... :(
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very lovely graphics, engaging games, fun for all ages.  Money is slow to come by, as is energy, but it's worth the download.
0375869026|5.0|I have read it twice and cried each time--rich layers of humor, love, pathos, and joy.  I like the different perspectives given by Auggie, Via, Jack, Justin, and Miranda.  I recommend it for students 5th grade through 8th grade.

0316286869|3.0|I just have a hard time believing that Kevyn created these looks with such simple steps. Truly he is a master and will always be thought of as one of the best makeup artist of all times. But it just seems to me that some steps were left out to create the master pieces in this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed the mystery of the journey of the story told. I did not figure it out before the end. I read fast. I like a book that grips me and makes me slow down my reading pace so I catch every word. I did buy this as an ebook. And am glad I did as I will re-read it.

B0006AAS5G|2.0|Like everything else in life, it usually makes sense to pay for quality.  I bought this watch because it looked good and overall, Invicta seems to have pretty high ratings on Amazon.  The good news is that I didn't pay a lot for this watch.  The bad news is that I got what I paid for.<br /><br />Within 30 days of owning the watch, a small chip broke off from the crystal face.  It wasn't that noticable, as it was on the very edge and was only maybe 1/8&#34; inch in length.  But it didn't bode well for the longevity of this device.  Which eventually came true.<br /><br />6 months after getting the watch, I was watching a football game on my sofa.  My team threw and interception, and in anger I slammed my hand down on couch cushion.  My watch went flying.  I apparently snapped the retaining rod that held the watch band to the watch face.  I tried to get it back into place, but no luck.  So I went to Invicta website for warranty assistance.  The instructions were to box it up and send it to them, along with $28 for shipping and handling.  This was about 40% of the cost of the watch, but whatever.  In addition to the band issue, I asked them to address the chipped face.<br /><br />After waiting about 3 weeks to hear from them, I received and email indicating that the watch repair could proceed if I authorized a $21 charge to address the crystal face.  At this point, I would be in for basically what I paid for the watch just to get it repaired.  I passed.  &#34;Don't throw good money after bad&#34; was something my grandfather taught me.  So I told them to just fix the snapped retaining rod.  I then got an email returned saying that they would begin the repair and that it could take up to 3 months to get the watch returned.  3 MONTHS.  So basically, if you have ANY warranty issue with an Invicta, you will chew up 25% of your warranty period just getting the repair done.<br /><br />So sometime in early 2014 I should get my watch back, at which point I will have less than 60 days of warranty remaining.  I don't expect this thing to last much longer than that based on my experience, and when it has the next issue, it will be going into the donation bin for Goodwill.<br /><br />You get what you pay for.  If you are interested in a high-value, low cost watch that looks good, stick to Seiko.  I've owned my Seiko self-winding watch for over 12 years, and only had a single issue to replace the capacitor after a decade.  Otherwise, it has operated flawlessly.  Should have stuck with what I knew.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Not too bad a game but could be improved upon, passess the time and quite addictive game so will recommend it.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Definitely a quick and funny read. I was a little hesitant to read this since there was a ton of hype about this book, but I honestly couldn't put it down. I'm not a big reader, but with non-fiction and especially something as humorous as this, it was fun to read.
B006OV7RQ4|4.0|Martha Marcy May Marlene is a film that is about a cult's effect upon a young victim's psychology when she escapes from the farm one morning.Earlier we had a vision of young Americana:two men hammer a fence,a goat nearby,women hang washing,a small child toddles about.Martha(Elizabeth Olsen)is like all the other young women are all damaged, drawn in by the blessed out benignity of the group's welcome,run by Patrick(John Hawkes),the charismatic, sociopathic,Manson-like head who binds all the females through the initiation ritual of drugged-out rape.Each female housemate is groomed by a fellow female into thinking this a transformative experience. Martha has her identity reworked by Patrick as a `Marcy May',and he sings her a song he's written for her in the group. Part pervert and part prophet, Patrick and the farm's other male residents take sexual advantage of women recruited from the streets to join their ranks as very second-class citizens.<br /><br />Retrieved from this limbo by her sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson), Martha explains her absence by saying that she'd been betrayed by &#34;a guy,&#34; readily authoring a substitute narrative of victimization.The family's beliefs are vague but decidedly anticapitalist; they share clothes, grow their own food, have group sex and group sing-alongs--and commit home invasions when they need money(sometimes with shocking violence).Due to the similarities between the time-share and the farm's rural locations, the film is sometimes purposefully unclear as to where she is and if she's Martha or Marcy May from scene to scene.The film presents her life at the commune in a series of flashbacks, triggered by events in the present,we almost never know where she is or who she is:her state of mind merges with the confused tone of the film.Martha maybe an unreliable narrator,she says &#34;you can't tell memory from dream&#34;.<br /><br />In the commune where lines are crossed in the name of goodness,where one person manipulates everyone for their own ends. Acts of violence are disguised as acts of generosity.The manipulation into normality of seizmic acts is made more eerie by the soothing calmness of the atmosphere.Martha herself colludes in drugging another girl for rape.The film asks what it means to belong.Martha is alienated from her own family,her sister Lucy's(Sarah Paulson)brittle aspirations and Ted's(Hugh Dancy) increasing irritations,after Martha accuses him of being a shallow materialist,Martha rants the anti-bourgois cliches she's been inculcated with.Her rejection of conventionality caused her to go into the cult.<br /><br />Martha's silence about her trauma suggests awkward fragility,but makes any development impossible in the present.Her paranoia is from her fear of the old family coming after her,watching and waiting to reel her back.She is like a wild animal, hunted,trapped,by her senses, by each sound.Olsen is perfect as Martha and John Hawkes reprises the menace of Winter's Bone. Moments of ambiguity and confusion transmit anxiety in a leisurely, understated manner that is more affecting than any extended monologue or horror shock.Durkin's film is like a waking dream,the hallucinatory unravelling of a wounded psyche,shifting uneasily between genres,with no resolution or ending,using subtlety rather than explanation.This is no redemption fable.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game. It has everything you want in a bingo game although I never buy games. The only minus is the bad bingo feature which often goes off if the number is near the bingo sign. It is the only game I play which finishes if you bad bingo, nevertheless I have given it five stars as very enjoyable.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I felt a bit conflicted while beginning this book. I initially felt that the book was portraying a teen girl blaming others for her suicide and she was getting revenge post-suicide on the peers who contributed to her emotional turmoil. Even though this may be a realistic portrayal of those who feel so oppressed and hopeless that they feel they have no other option than to end their life, I was worried for any youth/adults who may be facing similiar struggles and read this book. I was concerned that this story may encourage the concept: \\"You'll be sorry\\". However, as the book progressed, the point was made that Hannah had options - she could have talked to people that would have helped her through this time, she could have alerted people to the bullying she was facing. Hannah confessed that she was giving up and she took ownership of her choice, although circumstances were the \\"perfect storm\\" for her to feel that she did not have other options. Hannah is portrayed as a youth who exhibited the classic risk factors of self-harm/suicide but who is pretty much invisible to most people in her everyday life so nobody notices. When someone is considering suicide, they literally need someone to save their life and when that person goes unnoticed, it is a tragedy. This is an important lesson to us all. We can never assume that someone else will ask important questions, that someone else will pick up on alarming symptoms, that someone else will take an interest, we must each take action ourselves and be responsible for our instincts and gut feelings. I know Thirteen Reasons Why is just a book but there are plenty of youth out there right now who are living similiar experiences and feeling hopeless. I think Jay Asher portrayed realistic situations that our youth unfortunately face and he opens the reader's eyes to this and the burden on us all to not look the other way. This is an important story.<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br />\\"You don't know what goes on in anyone's life but your own. And when you mess with one part of a person's life, you're not messing with just that part. Unfortunately, you can't be that precise and selective. When you mess with one part of a person's life, you're messing with their entire life. Everything. . . affects everything.\\"<br /><br />Note: I listened to the audiobook which was wonderful. Thirteen Reasons Why is a story of a boy Clay who is listening to cassette tapes Hannah made explaining why she was choosing to commit suicide (but he is listening to them after her death). The audio features separate voices for Hannah and Clay so I felt that I was listening to the cassettes right along with Clay. It was moving and powerful. Their voices were full of emotion. While I have not read the book off the page, I would highly recommend the audio version if it is available to you.but your own.

B000FC13Y0|5.0|&#34;Young Tristran Thorn will do anything to win the cold heart of beautiful Victoria—even fetch her the star they watch fall from the night sky. But to do so, he must enter the unexplored lands on the other side of the ancient wall that gives their tiny village its name. Beyond that old stone wall, Tristran learns, lies Faerie—where nothing, not even a fallen star, is what he imagined.&#34;<br /><br />To date, this is my favorite book written by Neil Gaiman. It's a lovely story of how a boy's journey changes what he thought his heart desired. I just love Gaiman's storytelling. His stories are the fairy tales of this generation.<br /><br />My favorite quotes:<br />“You have to believe. Otherwise, it will never happen.”<br /><br />“He stared up at the stars and it seemed to him then that they were dancers, stately and graceful, performing a dance almost infinite in its complexity. He imagined he could see the very faces of the stars; pale, they were, and smiling gently, as if they had spent so much time above the world, watching the scrambling and the joy and the pain of the people below them, that they could not help being amused every time another little human believed itself the center of its world, as each of us does.”<br /><br />“Have been unavoidably detained by the world. Expect us when you see us.”
B005L38QK2|5.0|I've been playing Diablo3 for over a year.  That's a LOT of clicking.  The moues is extremely sturdy and has so far withstood the abuse I've been dishing out.<br /><br />Pros:  Sturdy construction, easy install, good feel.<br /><br />Cons:  Sometimes the additional side buttons get in the way and are accidentally clicked.  If you have these buttons bound to a key, it can be annoying.<br /><br />Overall, this is a gaming mouse that's meant for gaming - and it fulfills that duty beautifully.

B004132HZS|5.0|This series is fantastic. The DVD's are nice too. I love that it has the original pilot on there. You should take a look at it.
0345529057|1.0|These books sucked! I can't believe they became a series. They are so dark and boring filled with detailed description that are so pointless.
1616550414|5.0|I love this books. The art work is fabulous. I love how it tells the story of Zelda. It covers every Zelda game currently out. It even branches into the different time lines. It really is a lovely coffee table book for any  Zelda fan.
B00338QENI|4.0|I think Deborah would be pleased! Hopefully, the remaining Lacks children are able to reap some benefit of such a colossal contribution to science.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|best bingo to play you will love it alot. love love love.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The ending was so unexpected, but so raw. It made me emotional, and I love when a book is able to do that. This is a great piece of work.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|So far, I only have Batman, Superman, and Green Lantern. Batman is HANDS DOWN my favorite! His detailing is excellent and his paint is incredible! This is a piece that EVERY Batman fan MUST HAVE. I am floored by its beauty. I HIGHLY recommend this statue to any DC collector!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love games like this but hate &quot;asking&quot; friends for stuff. Now I can play on my Kindle Fire and not worry about that!
B008KHG2K2|4.0|The detail and paint on this piece are STELLAR! His belt is sculpted so well that it actually looks removable! Unfortunately, I can't get past the anime-Asian sculpt to Supe's face. Superman IS NOT ASIAN. He is everything AMERICAN that is NOT ASIAN.  Everything about this figure blows me away- except his face sculpt. I plan on completing this collection because it is phenomenal. I also have Batman and Green Lantern, and am very impressed by the quality and price point of these collectibles. It just saddens my heart that the primary character in this collection is SO OUT OF CHARACTER. For those looking to collect all of these statues (or even some of these): I HIGHLY recommend Kotobukiya's ArtFX Superman. For Supe's fans that ONLY planned on buying this ONE piece: I think you can find something better suited to the character elsewhere.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I love this movie because it is about standing up for yourself and about childhood crushes. It is much more than a vampire movie. It can be dark at times, but overall it is a favorite of mine.
B004QO9ZVG|5.0|Henning Mankell in The Troubled Man writing goes beyond a crime story, instead we follow Kurt as he progresses toward barely coping with the day to day where the memory is only enabled through his oft thinking and puzzling through in solving a case. We follow his thinking, his confusions, his friendships where he so infrequently fails to realise how respected and loved he is, as a man and a father. As a reader I feel privileged when I read a work so creative and follow the story one step behind always!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie cracks me up everytime I watch it. It is a favorite to keep on the DVD rack. Watch at least once.
B00F9040HU|4.0|very nice distracting and fun game.<br />If we would read the discription -  then reviews - then think - then decide - then - there are NO surprises.<br />I know these games must take a great deal of time and brain power for the designer / surely a few pennys leaves no room for fussy remarks.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is a great game  I like the fact that you play others live. I do wish you didnt need the tokens to keep playing
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Lots of levels and you don't have to spend money to play. Helps are free as well. Levels are challenging enough to keep me interested.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|It was a great book am getting all the other ones. It always kept me on my feet. I defentally recommend it
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this game is harder then some of the others but I've enjoyed. caution, time sill slip by before you know it.
B00E6G23TA|5.0|At the time I purchased this, only three 3-Star reviews were posted, quibbling with Chailly's approach, finding it too strident, etc.  I almost passed on it, but am glad I did not. Brahms' symphonic works have been a listening mainstay for me over 30 years, and my collection includes several recordings.  I found this recording a worthy addition.<br /><br />The haunting & lyrical themes of the 1st Symphony shine through the restoration of the original second movement. This alone, in my opinion, a revelation worth adding this recording to any Brahms lover's collection.<br /><br />I would also add that the Chailly's fidelity to the original instructions of the composer pared away what one published review I consulted termed &#34;unintended pathos and excessive Germanic gravitas,&#34; revealing a more evocative and beautiful rendering of this wonderful music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favorite game...I play it several times a day.  Sure there are levels that seem pretty impossible to pass and that can get a little boring sometimes. But you eventually do and then you feel fantastic!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Yes I MMMobear give this game five stars and &quot;the MMMobear stamp of approval&quot;<br /><br />Beautiful graphics and no bugs as far as I can see. Thx for an awesome app
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|LOVE this game. But after level 35 you have to pay in order to continue to play...I thought it was FREE! It's a great game but should be completely free!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like it and it is very easy to use. I especially like the audio version of the bible. Thank you.
034580709X|5.0|After reading 5 of the later novels in the Harry Hole series, I found this one comparable to all of the others and wish that it had been available when I started reading this series. It's a rather strange experience to read the first in the series after all of the others have dissected his character in great detail.
0307120007|5.0|One of my daughter's all-time favorite baby books.  It, along with &#34;Where's Spot&#34; and &#34;Goodnight Moon&#34; are a favorite gift to welcome new babies into our lives and into the lives of friends!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|At last, the greatest 2d rpg is finally on mobile devices! This game was awesome on consoles, this game was even better on the pc. But now, i can take my adventure where ever i go! &quot;Yes!&quot; This game is just like the version on pc, except for 1 or 2 items. It is definitely better then the Minecraft pocket edition, because it actually has all the stuff. Besides that this game is awesome and you have to play it. It is well worth the cost and it should actually be more expensive.<br /><br />There are 90 mobs! 90!<br />There are 100 something weapons!<br />And tons of... well everything you want from an rpg.<br /><br />I really recomend this game to eveyone! EVERYONE!<br />thx for reading!  ;)
B004SRNH10|1.0|Won't download.  Get error message.  Worthless app.  Needed it for a game I bought.  No answer from Adobe re problem.  Disappointed in Adobe.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved every second! Very well written! Beautiful and fun and chilling and intense. I almost threw up. I cried more than I care to admit. Made me love my husband more.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I loved the original game on face book. This one is much more user friendly and fun. Enjoying it very much
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love it! I love Katniss! I loved the ending. I finished this book months ago and every now and then I still pull it out and reread the epilogue just because it's SO AMAZING! Love it!
B003Y5H59C|5.0|I've seen this movie since I was in high school and i just loved it. The actors themselves are wonderful. Love it!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The most depressing, heart-breaking book I have ever read. Without totally spoiling everything, just know that this book makes Hunger Games read more like a Disney fairy tale - with singing woodland creatures and all. I wish I would have stopped reading 3/4 the way through and just invented an ending that I would have actually enjoyed. I have no idea what Veronica Roth was thinking. Maybe it had to be this way or something... whatever you have to tell yourself so that you can sleep at night. For whatever reason, you've lost a fan.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Yahoo mail does not work as smoothly as Outlook. They need the arrows for &#34;next&#34; and &#34;previous&#34; to make it easier to navigate.
B003WKLOTQ|5.0|Love it, it is so precious watching these babies from different parts of the world, there are many differences and but in the end they are really alike. I even enjoy watching it over and over, I don't do this with many videos. Love, love, love it!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like to play this game because so many of my family members and friends play also. It's always fun to beat someone's score on a level.
B006G2124E|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It's a historical fiction that allows readers to see a different view of history - through the help's eyes. It is well-written with many twists and turns along the way.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't know what to say but this is the best streaming device so far. I wish they make it to stream more than Youtube and Netflix though. But for the price, you can't go wrong.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the best TV shows I have ever watched. Be prepared to spend days on end watching this! It's a great series that is able to pull real life events into a fictional story, making every episode have many cliff-hanger moments.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Every time I go on it says either &quot;youtube has stopped&quot; or &quot;youtube is not responding. It's a good app if you like to watch videos. But it says it's free but every time accidentally hit the download button it's says I have to pay 1.99 for but I don't wanna pay that neither do a lot of other people.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This is my favorite author of all time.  The first two books were absolutely amazing, but this one was very easy to put down and forget about for a couple weeks.  The transitions were jarring and a little annoying, and after a while I gave up trying to keep track of the bloodlines because I didn't feel particularly attached to anyone in the story.  It took me about 6 months to finish this book, where the other two I read in the span of a few days.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I was curious who was curious who was the Nobel Prize and what kind of literature she wrote. I discover a gentle writing, daily life narrations, just that: LIFE. Nothing special except the sweetness of her feelings revealed in each story which contrasts with the passion of our Latin American writers.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Didn't Will Smith already make this movie?  I really didn't like this movie and wish I hadn't let my husband convince me to watch it.  I'd have rather pulled I am Legend out of my collection and watched that.
0143124404|2.0|Afraid that I have to agree with the review in Bookforum shown above.  Very little that is original or well-supported, and the analysis, such as it is, is sloppy.  Diamond can spin a nice tale and (as one other review commented) uses some nice illustrations, but this book is hardly thought-provoking, which was at least true of some earlier efforts.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I am in love with this album.  There isn't a song on here I don't like and I really think it lived up to and beyond the hype.  Katy did an excellent job.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Everyone knows this is very famous and popular. Good for a gift for someone never seen it yet. Must see movie in the lifetime.
B00GHJ6BJW|2.0|This album just wasn't for me, I just couldn't get into it.  Too bad because I really liked the last one, it was great for tuning out from the world while I was running.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good story. Will hold you in suspense and it is very well written. I would recommend this book to any gender.
1439152810|4.0|The book did not read as easily as some books I've read lately. The story got long and dragged out after a while and I knew how it would end before I finished the book. When a book goes back and forth from one time period to another, and I am not a fan of that style of writing.
030746363X|5.0|Not finished with the text but have enjoyed what I read and found it helpful for me. At least thus far.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row by John Grisham is a well crafted, powerful story.  Twenty-five years after publication of A Time to Kill, the book that catapulted him to the top of the Best Seller lists, Grisham has brought back attorney Jake Brigance, once more involved in an extremely complicated case.  Why in the world would a successful business man hang himself and leave his wealth to his maid, cutting his children entirely out of his will?
B006OOHYIC|5.0|After completing Quell, I turned right away to its sequel, Quell Reflect. I am pleased that the wonderful graphics and calming music are much like that of the original game. However, Quell Reflect adds new game elements and challenges to delight new players and old alike. New dangers await, including poison drops and movable spikes. My favorite new feature is the ability on some levels to play with multiple raindrops. It adds new dimension to the game, and I cannot wait to play it again..
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book really grabs your attention!  It has its funny moments and its sad ones.  You never know what is going to transpire next.
0385351399|3.0|When Mae lands a coveted job at the Circle, the world's largest internet company, she is over the moon. The campus, staffed with thousands of believers in the company philosophy of global transparency, appears to be a utopian paradise and she is determined to rise through the ranks.<br /><br />Dave Eggers always gives the reader something new and surprising, and this is no exception. However, the writing style in this novel lacks his usual bite and mordant humour. This may very well be intentional. The main character of Mae is merely a cipher and the people who work at the Circle - brilliant, one and all - have a creepy Stepford feel to them. Although the campus is vast and its glass structures magnificent, there is a definite air of claustrophobia that makes for uncomfortable reading, as if the reader has entered the realm of an ominous, inescapable cult.<br /><br />Mae &#34;drinks the Kool-Aid&#34; much to the gratification of her colleagues and her bosses but to the displeasure of others beyond the campus. Her ex-boyfriend - another cipher - is the lone representative of the many millions who would oppose the totalitarian tendencies of such an organisation and the inexorable loss of personal privacy that they espouse. As an admirer of Dave Eggers' work, I have mixed feelings about this book. It's imaginative, it's frightening and it's no doubt prophetic. But it could have been so much better. A good one for book groups, I suspect, but for me it needed much more of the Eggers 'edge'.
B009AY04A8|3.0|The hidden pictures are a challelnge, but the dialog between segments is rather long and boring.  Fun but not fantastic.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I love that fact that Paul continues to be on a creative bend. I enjoy most of the songs on this CD.
B007T7MIR0|4.0|This is a pretty user-friendly office viewing app.  I haven't paid for the upgrade to allow me to make changes to office documents because I don't need that feature but I am sure it would function just as well as the free features taht allow me to view Office Documents.  This has really made the difference with the usability of my tablet.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This is is simple...best movie of 2013.  And if you've seen it, you own it.  If you haven't seen it, ya need to do so.  Sure some of the facts are wrong.  Some of the language harsh.  Guess what?  That's America for you.  Enjoy!  Then buy the soundtrack.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game. At first I didn't, but it ended up getting really fun and addicting. Great game over all.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Fantastic soundtrack!  Supported the movie 100% and while listening to it you will remember certain scenes that will make you say, &#34;Damn that was some movie.&#34; For me it was the movie of 2013.  Long live Django (and the D is silent MF)
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I got it in perfect conditions, and the music is pretty enjoyable! I was totally expecting my CD to arrive on this conditions.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|A must see for EVERYONE!  This movie shows the last Michael Jackson concert rehearsal and makes you feel like you're there.  Pro - you remember how unbelievably talented he (and no other) was.  Con - you are saddened when reality hits that MJ's passing was shortly after the film.  We love you Michael.
B0030T1NAO|1.0|i cant play season 2 and 3 as it says &#34;mismatch between disc and player region codes&#34;. such a waste of money

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Opened up a new are of study for me I was somewhat unaware of policy situation of the time in which the Jesus of Nazareth lived.
6304711905|5.0|I love this movie so much that I can't count how many times I've seen it.  If you like a good western.  If you like a priceless catch phrase.  If you like good vs bad.  This is the movie for you every time.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I love this movie. It is my favourite movie. It is the best movie. Every time I watch it, I  die of laughter. The first time, though, I about passed out it was so funny.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|Who doesn't love The Beatles!  Great grouping of their hits!  Whether you're at home, on the beach or on the road - great listening!
B0011X9S3K|5.0|Yes, the sound is dated... These recordings were made in the78 rpm era, with limited sound range, with a non-too obtrusive “frying pan” background noise, but the musicianship, the understanding between the players and the sheer honesty of their performance makes them unique. I own the Amadeus, the Vegh, the Italiano, Emerson and even the Hollywood quartet performances which in their own way are special. I have to admit that the Busch quartet are not as technically perfect  as some of the ones mentioned above, but they are in my opinion the best, because no matter how many times you listen to them, they sound “fresh” and leave you with the feeling of listening to these Beethoven  masterpieces for the first time.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|An old movie but Tom Hanks is fabulous in it.  Shelley Long is a perfect partner in this.  Definitely a must see!
B000VOC90Y|1.0|Buyer beware!  The backpack started coming apart at the seams after 9 months. The backpack supposedly has a 3 year warranty but this is worthless if the customer service department will not respond to a customer's repeated forms of contact.  Buy another brand.
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|Loved the story but hard to keep the characters straight. Keep the cast of characters in front of you.  Plot development draws the reader in, many twists and turns.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The characters are not all &#34;perfect&#34; people.  You cannot guess the ending.  It is just a very  good story with a plausible,but surpising ending.
B008JFURKG|5.0|There are very few sequels I’ve seen that can hold a candle to the original films.  Most of these follow-up movies are lacking in some area, whether it’s story or script, or even a miscasting of the characters.  But RED 2 does not fall anywhere into this category of part-two-hell.  Instead, this sequel takes the franchise to another level.  The result is a highly entertaining film full of laughs and rapid-fire action. <br /><br />I enjoyed the first RED a lot, as did my whole family.  We liked how the humor was mixed skillfully with the action, which in turn made us laugh and even cringe in certain places.  But RED 2 gives this and so much more.  I can honestly say this is one of the few films that actually transcends its predecessor.<br /><br />RED 2 is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  But two primary components make this movie a huge hit:  the story and the acting.  The plot is very interesting and is filled with twists and turns.  But even so, my youngest (who is 10) did not have a problem following what was happening.  The storyline is great and intricate, but it does not overwhelm the audience in the least.<br /><br />The acting is also a huge plus for this film.  Bruce Willis returns as the main hero, Frank Moses.  And with him, as before, are John Malkovich, the enchanting Helen Mirren, and Mary-Louise Parker.  But we are also treated to newcomers like Anthony Hopkins, Catharine Zeta-Jones and  Byung-hun Lee.  This star-studded ensemble blends perfectly onscreen, giving a cast that any filmmaker would sell his soul to work with.<br /><br />RED 2 is a massive win for me and I hope director Dean Parisot considers making a third film; I would definitely give it a look.  I recommend giving this one a shot, especially if you haven’t seen the first RED.  I suggest getting both and making a night of them.  RED is available now, while RED 2 will be released next week in a variety of formats.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really enjoy this one. So far I have had no problems. Better than mystery manor so far, keeps me interested and play it every day.
0399162097|2.0|I read other reviews, and I read the book jacket. I kept waiting for a deeply profound event to happen but I guess I just didn't get this book. Rosemary, her unusual sister Fern, her fugitive brother and scientist patents all round out an original and what could/should be highly entertaining family. Perhaps it was the jumbled timeline and story structure that I disliked most, but something made me really have to work to finish this book. (I hate to leave any book unfinished.) In my opinion, time is better spent watching the documentary film Project Nim than reading this novel.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The characters in this book will steal your heart. Each scene was so well written., it was as if you were right in the story. These images will remain in my memory for a long time.
B0090SI582|4.0|What an awesome, action-packed film!<br />Best part is it ties into the existing X-Men films but really is in a league of its own.<br />Makes me love Wolverine more than I do already too, and that says a lot since he has always been my favorite X-Men character.<br />The movie was very well-made, well-cast and well-written. Kind of predictable story-line but that was alright by me. The action made it work.<br />This is definitely up on my favorites for action movies now.<br /><br />4.5/5
B00ADQPB50|4.0|my friend order this for her friend off my account but it came in good timing idk about how it plays because it wasnt for me but boxed looked nice and everything
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So very happy to find this game today and get it on my kindle fire. It's working just fine and hopefully will continue to do so. Avid fan of the game on Facebook  and sure that will be the case here as well. Please keep it simple and inexpensive and you'll have much success. Thank you<br />Sandra
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful actors, beautifully filmed and a good story! Love streaming this whenever it is convenient. Plus easier to hear when you can watch the film from your lap on your iPad.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|Fast delivery. Great movie! My family and i can watch this movie over and over again. Glad they have it in blu-ray. Makes it very clear and realistic looking when watching on our tv screen.
B00ECUX7HC|4.0|These folks can play, sing and definitely entertain.  I'm trying to make it to one of their live performances and can't imagine what a blast it will be!  Yes Susan Tedeschi reminds you of Bonnie Raitt and Derek Trucks may be the second coming of Stevie Ray Vaughn.

B0077ATSSQ|4.0|It takes a very special kind of child actor to carry a heavy dramatic film like EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE.  While Thomas Horn presents an often petulant, quirky Oskar, nonetheless this preteen has exceptional screen presence as a grieving youth on a search to somehow connect with his father (Tom Hanks, who appears throughout the film in flashbacks), who died in one of the Twin Towers during 9/11.  It quickly becomes readily apparent that Oskar had a very close relationship with Thomas, his father, and that Thomas would challenge his son via word games and father/son excursions in Manhattan to broaden the youth's horizons.  The vacuum in Oskar's life is literally unbearable, a vacuum Oskar's mother (Sandra Bullock), to her chagrin, can't ease, and it is only when Oskar finds a mysterious key in a blue vase in his parents' closet that draws him out of his malaise to search New York to find out what door the key unlocks--and perhaps find a message from Thomas.  It appears to be an impossible task, and Oskar grows increasingly frustrated, but there is ultimately a less-than-satisfying payoff.<br /><br />Again, Thomas Horn is an exceptional talent; the pain and anguish his character is experiencing throughout this film is powerful and unflinching.  Bullock and Hanks turn in solid performances--especially Bullock as the film begins to conclude.  But what a second tier of characters!  Max von Sydow is terrific as a mute tenant of Oskar's grandmother who accompanies the boy during his search.  The veteran actor doesn't have a single line, yet the performance he conveys via his facial expressions is astounding.  John Goodman just keeps getting better and better, and here he doesn't disappoint as the doorman of the building where Oskar lives.  And Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are extremely believable as an estranged couple--the first people Oskar visits as he begins his search.  The secret of the key less than satisfies, and the message under the swing seat firmly tweaks suspension of disbelief, but when it comes to a powerful drama that will take your breath away (Thomas's phone messages the morning of 9/11 are stunning examples) and have you wiping away tears, EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE is without peer.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.weaks suspension of disbelief, but when it comes to a powerful drama that will take your breath away (Thomas's phone messages the morning of 9/11 are stunning examples) and have you wiping away tears, EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE is without peer.<br />--D.

B0085TKAW6|5.0|Winter of the World,the sequel to Fall of Giants, is an excellent novel.  I enjoyed it even more than Fall of Giants and enjoyed the move to the next generation in all the original characters from the first novel.  The historical perspective of the rise of Facism and the movement to another World War is excellent, as are the characters development and growth during the war.<br /><br />I would recommend this novel to all Ken Follett fans, fans of historical fiction as well as any fans of great stories.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|I am a 60 year old child.  This is a movie for all ages.  Makes me feel bad about anatomy class.  But I feel as if I make up for it every time I watch this adorably sweet movie.

Geezzzz<br /><br />Skip it, and skip the newer Russell Crowe version too.<br /><br />INSTEAD:  Watch the version starring Patrick Bergen, which was very good [it came out the same year as Costner's] or the 'ole 'Errol Flynn' version with it's sword-fight in shadow sequence - great filmmaking.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Amazing storyline, all ties in. I could not put this book down at all. Would read till literally my eyes would close. If you like zombies, this could be as close to a realistic zombie Apocalypse novel could be. I could not ask for more, if you are honestly debating reading this book do it, you will not be disappointed. Max Brooks was a genius.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|The film is dated, but the story is timeless.  Ruth Gordon was the perfect choice for Maude, and Bud Cort as the 'wiser than his years', rebellious, young adult conveyed the anti-establishment sentiment of the times.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|too early to fully rank but so far it is a 4 it may go to a 5 but tooo early
B00E193TM2|5.0|This album grew on me and then became what I expected out of FFDP, def a good purchase, you can listen to it on repeat all day and night.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Growing up my husband and I loved this movie and now my 7 year old daughter does too.  Glad I made the purchase.
0802473156|4.0|Everyone should read this, even to just understand that people feel loved and appreciated in different ways. There are many editions available (i.e. for singles, kids, etc.), so check out the one that applies to you. This book is focused toward married couples.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I got a nice printer upgrade for under $15.00 it was easy to install and my printer processes jobs faster now. You can also order HP's official one, same specs for a few hundred bucks. They shipped it out to me right away.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I remembered this movie and its magic from quite some time ago.  I bought the movie to share with my grandchildren.. ages 10-16.  I would not recommend it for under age 7.  It isn't violent as an adult would describe it , but could upset a younger child.  A lot of &#34;adult&#34; humor !!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Thus game is off the chain well the next update they need to but flat world so it would be even better
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great and is affordable. Just have to wait for Google to add compatibility for more software/providers, but it wont be long now. Wife likes to put picture slideshows up on TV when family visits - flawless.
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|Quick solve. Entertaining animation and puzzles but annoying end puzzles and mini games. Instructions to play are very easy to figure out.

B00EZQJX76|4.0|Pollyanna is a &#34;feel good book&#34; it inspires an inner joy that lasts and lasts.  Its like eating a delicious dessert and not feeling guilty over the calories.  I beleive there are many people like that around in fact they; are everywhere  and its a good feeling.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I joined a crossfit gym and was introduced to the Paleo or Primitive diet.  I read the Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf and this book. I decided to give it 30 days and WOW the weight began to effortlessly melt away.  I have dropped almost 28lbs in 3 months and feel great!  I am  a 50 year old man who feels like he rolled the clock back 20 years.  I no longer eat aleve for joint pain and recently stopped taking Prevacid for acid reflux after using it for the last ten years.<br />It is a little radical but the benefits are well worth it.  I am still maneuvering social gathering and holidays.<br />Give this book a chance - the only thing you have to lose is the weight.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I really liked this book but I hoped it would go on a little more. I am definitely going to read the other books
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|this game is entertaining but seems to be a lot like any other game app, you cant just play the game it requires you to involve facebook or buying points.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I always considered Pres. Lincoln to be one of the most important Presidents of the United States, but now, after reading this book, realized how miraculous his service was in bringing about the critical change for our nation.  His sublime influence over his administration, and many that could have derailed the ending of slavery and the division of the nation, was a gift to all generations that followed.  This novel is essential reading for all who want greater insight into one of the greatest Presidents of the United States.  (A Soldier serving the Union)
B008ALAHA4|5.0|It does its job! I love having it so I can keep my old charger at the office with this on it and my new charger with my retina on me at all times.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I have read a number of middling and poor reviews of this book. But it's a great read. Interesting, creative, thoughtful. It's essentially a morality tale about how public social media is eating away at our ability to live private, unobserved lives. It also talks a fair bit about the winner take all position of Google-like and Facebook-like sites reaching into every aspect of our lives. It's good to ponder. Eggers is a wonderful literary writer, who writes clearly and elegantly.<br /><br />I happened to love Hologram for the King and it was a more compelling read but I would certainly put this in my  Top 10 for the year.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Better than anything M Night Shalyman has done in quite a while but still deeply flawed. It had the potential of being a great movie but fell short and it appears to be the result of over editing and perhaps too much was left out by the editing staff. Who knows?
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is a wonderful movie that brings to life the sense of loss and sorrow that so many New Yorkers have about the morning of September 11th.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it. Just waiting for more apps and content that supports the device. The chrome plugin to cast a tap is probably the most used aspect of this device for me.
0792160347|5.0|Really loved this movie, Richard Gere is an awesome actor, the movie was really, really good!  He is quite the looker in this movie!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A fun read from a different type of perspective concerning the individual experiences that may happen during a zombie outbreak. Very little like the movie, so make sure you read this too!
B00ET2ODU8|3.0|In the early `70's, the tawdry adult film industry discovered a new star.  Linda Lovelace (Amanda Seyfried) whose real name was Boreman had what was at the time, an unusual gift for fellatio.  This film attempts to provide some context as to how she became an icon of the porn industry.  To some degree the story comes from her own biography, \\"Ordeal.\\"<br /><br />Linda was a somewhat naïve teenager growing up in a strict religious family.  Her mother, Dorothy (an unrecognizable and excellent Sharon Stone) was particularly tough on Linda.  Perhaps that was due to the fact that Linda already had a baby which was put up for adoption.  While the film mentions the child, it is quickly glossed over.  Linda meets an older man who owns a cheapo disco club.  Chuck Traynor (played with remarkable sleaze by Peter Sarsgaard) has eyes for Linda and slowly builds up their relationship to the point that she trusts him with everything.  Next thing you know, they're married.<br /><br />Chuck has a number of low life connections including those involved in the porn industry.  At that time, much of it was controlled by the mob.  He convinces Linda that auditioning for an adult film would lead to legitimate acting gigs.  After a few head bobbing lessons from Chuck, he films her abilities and shows the film to a director (Hank Azaria) and producer/mobster (Chris Noth).  She's in.  They make the film \\"Deep Throat.\\"  By the standards of the time, the film was top shelf stuff.  With a decent budget, a modestly interesting script, some humor and of course Linda's deep throat, the film begins to draw in mainstream audiences.<br /><br />Chuck, by now is squandering money he doesn't have.  He's coked up most of the time and even rents out Linda to a handful of business men for their enjoyment.  This is disgusting stuff to be sure.  The film presents Linda as just a victim in all of this.  And certainly, based on her mother's warnings (\\"Just do what your husband wants you to do.\\") and Chuck's temper, is honest in some degree.  But Linda says that this is the only film she made and she only was in \\"the business\\" for 17 months.  I'm not sure that's true and I know there was more than one film she appeared in.<br /><br />The film can be shocking at times, but most of the explicit scenes aren't.  There are plenty of bare breasts but otherwise not much beyond suggestion.  The acting is very good, but the film left me cold.<br /><br />The Blu ray version comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The film has a bit of softness to it which certainly isn't offensive and actually seems appropriate for the era.  There is also a fair amount of grain in the picture but again, no big deal.  The disc comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The surround feature comes in primarily during the several party scenes and nights at the clubs.  Otherwise, this is a mostly dialog driven movie and comes in clear and concise.  There is only one extra called \\"Behind Lovelace\\" which is a 13 minute piece consisting of the cast and crew commenting on Linda.  Yawn...mper, is honest in some degree.  But Linda says that this is the only film she made and she only was in \\"the business\\" for 17 months.  I'm not sure that's true and I know there was more than one film she appeared in.<br /><br />The film can be shocking at times, but most of the explicit scenes aren't.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great book, I just can't stop reading it!<br />I love the series and hope Veronica will write more books<br />So go and read the book
0316055433|5.0|Reading This novel on the kindle did not seem as long as many reviewers complain about.  The characters were well developed, making me envision the casting for the inevitable movie version. The plot twists and turns, and while some portions are predictable, others are unexpected.  I could not wait to find time to sneak in another chapter!  The end is a bit sad from a thought-provoking sense, with Ms. Tartt writing what many people are afraid of actually admitting.
B006LSZECO|5.0|As an avid suspense and thriller reader, this book met my expectations.  Not a story that I knew what would happen next.  I got involved with characters and had mixed feelings about what I thought of them at the end.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Even though I have a android this app works perfectly with any tablet that it is used on.  I sometimes go between my Acer, Kindle e-reader, and my husbands Nextbook reading books and on all of the products it works superb.  I just love it!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Best book I have read in 2013.  Cannot believe I waited so long to buy this book!  The reader gets absorbed in the story and characters, hard to put book down.  Ending took me by surprise, then, think about a parents love for their child and the depth of love and sacrifices they make on a moral level.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a beautiful game to play on kindle fire HDX.  The game is amusing and fairly easy to play.  It is a long term game unless you purchase loads of tokens to rapidly advance thru game.  If you work with what you have you can take your time and come back later to advance without additional tokens.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|I recently purchased the Kindle Fire HD 2nd Generation (2013) for my daughter for Christmas.  I was hoping to use this app in her Free Time to allow her to watch videos that were loaded into the &#34;Movies&#34; directory.  The app works great when I'm in regular mode on the Kindle, but as soon as I go into Free Time, it says there are no files (can't see them).<br /><br />From previous reviews it looks like it used to work, so I'm guessing the Free Time software on the Kindle has changed.
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|This book, like most of the world's influential personal  development and business books, focuses on how best to approach life and your career. Should be mandatory at all high schools and Universities. Harry. Sydney Australia

B00F9040HU|5.0|I really like playtrix games. They are challenging without being competitive. Having some history to follow along is also interesting.
B004W4N55C|3.0|Whether you play guitar now or are just starting your journey, this is a great tool - metronome, tuner, chord library, and access to an enormous tab library (that syncs with your UltimateGuitar.com account).  I still prefer my Snark, so I haven't used the tuner feature, but the other stuff is worth the fee.  With caveats.<br /><br />Once upon a time, I would have given this app five stars and say it was worth the money.  Whether running Froyo or Jellybean, this app does work on all Android phone I've tried (though with occasional force closes and sync sometimes just doesn't), but it has no tablet support - the tools worked on my ICS tablet but JB killed the ability to use the few functions that were usable.  I didn't take a star off for the no tablet support, but I wish the developer had been forthright about it.<br /><br />I did knock two stars off for this app not having been updated in forever.  I might not have if the app was cheaper, but with that price tag, you're expecting at least an update or two.  (This app has stayed the same since I was still running a Galaxy SI.)  I don't mean feature updates, either.  I mean updates so that the app will run smoothly on newer Android versions.  With each new OS update, this app glitches more, and if the developer doesn't want to update the app, then either the app should be pulled or it should be listed as being best on certain systems.<br /><br />You do get an enormous selection of tabs, but what you're really paying for is the app interface of a free service.  The same tabs are available on the [free] website, and while it will sync up (sometimes) your favourites from the app and the website, sometimes the favourites you've saved on the app will mysteriously disappear.  (I now work exclusively off the website to save tabs I like.)<br /><br />All in all, it's a three-star app only due to the glitches and no updates.  The standard price, especially compared to comparable apps, is too high to justify glitches and no updates to fix those glitches.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Who doesn't want to have an aquarium without all the cleaning and feeding .So fun! Try this game  and just relax.
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|PROS:<br />+ Versatile setup options<br />+ Decent Sound & Voice<br />+ Comfortable for medium to smaller heads<br />+ Battery Life<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Mini USB (should go Micro for charging)<br />- Headset seems small and might be tight on larger heads.<br />- Not completely wireless for PS4.<br /><br />With the launch of the PS4, I was going to have my console in my computer room. With my new setup I wanted to find a headset that I could connect to both my PS4 and Macbook Pro at the same time and with the ability to switch between the two w/o having to unplug/re-plug wires. Another requirement was that I needed to be able to chat on either device (also, w/o having to swap out each time). The Turtle Beach PX4s fit the bill almost perfectly and I don't think there is another set that can do what I ask.<br /><br />SETUP<br /><br />Sound -<br />PS4 to PX4 via Optical.<br />MacBook Pro to PX4 via 3.5mm.<br />PX4 USB Power to outlet.<br /><br />Voice -<br />PS4 voice via chat cable to DualShock 4 (I knew about this going in since I did my RESEARCH, and it does not bother me).<br />MacBook Pro via Bluetooth<br /><br />Setup Notes - Optical is the primary source on the PX4 receiver. Since there is no physical switch, if the Optical source is on (in my case the PS4) then it will default to that. In order for me to get sound via the MacBook I have to put the PS4 in Standby or powered off (which is what I would do anyways).<br /><br />Sound Quality - I'm not an &#34;audiophile&#34; or sound snob, so I can only give you my opinion. They sound good, on par with other headsets I've owned or tried recently (i.e. Astro A30s, Sennheiser RS160, and Razer Kraken 7.1). The surround seems to work nicely, nothing sounds washed out, and I get a good immersed feeling in games. I also use these to watch shows and movies at night and have no complaints from that aspect as well.<br /><br />Voice Quality - Whether it was via the DualShock 4 or Bluetooth, I did not get any complaints about my voice quality.<br /><br />Comfort - These are comfortable for me, but I would like to point out that they don't seem very big. Usually on headsets I only adjust the bad 3 or 4 notches and still usually have more room to work with. With the PX4s my adjustments seem to be close to max size which means people with bigger heads might not find them very comfortable.<br /><br />Overall - I am very pleased with the PX4s. I don't know if they are worth $150, but at the same time I don't feel bad about paying that much since it fills all my needs perfectly. I find them comfortable, good sounding, and best of all, love the versatility to be able to hooked up to multiple devices.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|A fun game that gets you hooked! I love to spend time on it and explore, getting more in depth with this game.

1442362537|5.0|King is back to nearly top form and creates a novel worthy of his finest early work. The Shining is his best work and enough of that classic &#34;shine&#34; shows through Dr. Sleep to make this his best work in decades.<br /> I listened to the audio version and Will Patton is, as usual, the best dramatic reader in the business. I've purchased other audio novels just on the basis of his audio acting skills. I give 5 stars to Will Patton's reading and 4.5 to King's writing.<br /><br />The MP3 format of this recording is perfect for listening to a long novel like this without the problem of shuffling discs on a long drive. There are only two.
B00005RIKI|5.0|this album is one of their best.<br />I really don't think lynyrd skynyrd<br />puts out a bad album in my opinion
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Visually stunning, great acting, music is wonderful and follows the original Broadway operetta very well. Amazing job all around.  Excellent!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|This Pulse tracker is working just fabulous for me. It is absolutely beneficial to me in helping me monitor my health. The sleep and heart rate monitors give me and my doctor current and historical information which I think is just great. My son led me to this unit and I have not been disappointed. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to monitor their physical activities.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|This product serves no purpose at all. I am not even sure now what I got it for? It doesn't do anything
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I've been a listener of AccuRadio for years on my computers. When I discovered that it was finally an app, I immediately installed it on my cell phone, two Android tablets, and my Kindle tablets. With the vast array of genres, I defy anyone to not find something to enjoy listening to.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Did not install at all and this cost to much I think for us to be notified of a storm. Come on we should have a free E.R. app. for this. It is to importanat
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|I suspect this writer will improve with time, but this is definitely an early work. Still, the story is fun and carries things quite far.
B00EI2Y4MQ|3.0|This is ok, but if you own and we all do own a cell phone or tablet then you already have the upper hand on a much better one
0312330855|4.0|Not much to say about this warm and charming book, 500 pages, because it was exactly the PBS series, which I saw before I read the book.  Starts with his bus ride, and ends with Helen sitting on a stone wall, writing down TB testing.  The writer for the TV series just lifted whole and entire from this book,  Very little got left out, which is good, because the book is enchanting and rather uplifting, in a gentle way.  Highly recommended.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great songs,sound and great price. Not only all that but you earn as you buy. I earned one song of my choice for buying this cd. and the song you pick automatically just downloads to any device you want it too. OH first install this MP3 on your device. I installed it on my Android phone
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love this movie! Acting, singing, story-line - all of it is just plain feel good!<br />You will love it too!
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|This is a great cd. I am not a miley fan but her music is great and it beats out the fact that I like her or not
B002BXGI14|5.0|This was one of my favorite seasons Im glad Id got to own all the seasons and watch them back to back.I love Mark Harmon hes a great actor.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app, you can find all kind of radio programs and stations that you never knew existed or ever bother to listen to.<br />Great for finding talk radio programs, I use it in my PC and the TV (using Boxee and Roku)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm hopelessly addicted to this game. Once you start playing it, you need to have a buddy stop you before running up a balance on your credit card!
B009IU6BIS|5.0|I can never get enough of this movie. I love it every time I watch it with my daughter. Great movie.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I kinda like the first game better , but this one is nice in so many way too. It's fun and great for any age
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm only 12, but this book is great-it tells us about human cruelness and greed.<br />I understood a lot with this book.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Mostly watchable. I liked it.  My 12 year old really liked it. The special effects are great. The pacing is strange, there are hoes in the setup, and I had trouble suspending my disbelief; I was always thinking about the fact that he's will Smith's son. There are times I ask if I should see a lim in a theater, or just wait 'til it's out on Netflix (or Amazon :-)). This one is a perfect candidate for the latter.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Overall, good character development.  The action scenes were OK - That's never been big interest for me with Superman - but only 4/5 because it was a bit choppy- it would have been better if they had focused via chronologically on his childhood and its struggles.  Quite consistent with the main character of Superman.
B00C1040TO|5.0|this app eliminates most if the tools I have lying around my house that I use to pay music. I pay piano, acoustic and electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums and it's amazing. The metronome is extremely helpful and the running spot in. Thank you!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautifully written, characters so well defined you fall in love with them, I had a well deserved cry at the end.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I probably use google every day, can find anything I need right there, having the app on my phone makes it a lot easier
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|What a fun story that brings one back to Ireland!  I loved the quirky characters and the endearing plot - was a nice little book to pass the time.  I would read other books by this author.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love Sci-Fi and Star Trek is cool Sci-Fi. Can't wait to see the next movie. I love the way they started over but still lincs with the past.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good page turner and interesting plot - a great read while commuting to work.  Will read other works by this author.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Excellent brain stimulation in gradually more complex puzzles. As arrangements become more complex, additional tiles require more specific recognition of less obvious differences.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|So so.  An ok watch.  Free would be perfect.  I would wait for this streamed instead of paying for.  You have been warned :)
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|My mom loves this movie. She only had it on VHS.  Her VHS player stopped working and since they are becoming obsolete, we are replacing her VHSs with DVDs. She is very happy.
B00FXRTWQ8|1.0|Huge letdown!  Game freezes on Kindle Fire when you try to buy new tank. They know this and refuse to fix it. Hundreds have complained, yet no response. Never again when I buy from them!

B003JTHWJQ|3.0|Richard Dawkins probably and generally presents the clearest, most relevant prose arguments as to why religion should NOT receive all the hushed respect and government approved (and culture approved!) financial support it has gathered over all time.<br /><br />This book may be his seminal attempt to put organized (and disorganized) supernatural belief systems to rest once and for all, but he lets his love for and fascination with &#34;memes&#34; get him and his reader totally bogged down with his vocabulary and professorial argumentative style and substance.<br /><br />I want more meat and less garnish, more informative arguments which I have not explored nor thought of and less of his obvious attempts to foresee and forestall the oppositions' &#34;Ah,hah!&#34; moments.<br /><br />Please, just stick to serving a wonderful, albeit simple meal which I can savor and digest so that it all comes out in the end as the pure feces it is.<br /><br />Thank you, Richard, for what you do best.  Please try to do more of it.  My  filtering process is taking longer than my reading process in this book.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Very well done story and the plot was very intriguing.  Made you think of both sides of the addiction problems.  Also very exciting flight filming.  Also, didn't hurt that the star was Denzel Washington.

B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It's funny if you like these kind of games, like creating cities and things likd that, however this one can be a little slow sometimes
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game does have lovely colorful cute graphics, euhoinious music and really sweet and playful concept as a puzzle game. But (ah yes , I hate this &#34;but&#34;) here comes the bitter part, if you don't want to spend some money to do some in game purchase, things will get ugly in several ways. First, at level 35, you need to finish three extra puzzles to unlock the next chapter. To make this worse, after you finished one puzzle, you will have to wait 24 hours then the next puzzle will come to available. Second, even you are patient enough to invest some time, here is another tricky part, the candies might be changed and relocated by the program during the game! Whenever the program claims &#34;there is no more possible move&#34;, all your puzzles (or your candies) will immidiately be replaced or relocated by the game AKA your opponent at its own convenience. So think about that, you already figure out your strategy to clear all the puzzles then after you already use up some of your moves, kaboom! Everything changes and you have either spend some money for some &#34;booster&#34; or buy yourself some more &#34; moves&#34; to finish the game or else. And the game will continue to give you some useless candy to guarantee your faliar until you spend hours after hours for one single chapter. Eventually you have reach the threshold of time accumulation  in that one single chapter, they will let you pass. Since I did experience some of the senarios the computer suddenly keeped sending me very useful candies to solve my puzzle like too good to be true.<br />Honestly, I would rather spend some$$$ to buy a fair play game at the very beginning. This &#34; free then force you to pay&#34; is so called &#34;blackmail&#34;.

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|terrible movie, couldn't understand the words and what they were saying. Worst movie ever that either of these actors were in. Shut it off 1/4 through.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham's books have always rated highly with me. Sycamoire Row is outstanding; a hard-to-put down story with surprising but believable turns along the way. Superb!
0385333846|5.0|I bought this for my bf as a christmas light book read and he loves it he laughes out loud till this day...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. It is very addicting, it has different challenges that you must complete before you can move on to a different room.
0066620996|5.0|easy read and it is very helpful as many great stories about great leaders transform the companies and brought them to a new level of competition
B00FXEL00W|4.0|A refreshing love story that was well written. Enjoyed the story being told in both characters point of view. Somewhat predictable ending, but overall pleased with the purchase.
B008MM9630|4.0|I like it, I like that you don't have to depend on nonlinear access and don't have to depend on other people sending me stuff to complete missions. The only downfall would be the crystals or diamonds that you have to get to buy certain things.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is awesome... my Mom had this app forever and she would not let me play... Well guess what. It I  free, you must have it!!!
B00EUS9IBU|4.0|Good album overall. A few songs didn't grab me, but all the good songs make up for that. McCartney has still got it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think this game is awesome because it is the same as Mario but the person is different and  bombs and coins are different.
B00001ODGR|5.0|great concert with many hits! I love this dvd, because it has the original band, other then John, of course.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Great story.<br />Awesome ending never expected<br />Great acting by all<br />One of my favorite movies of all time<br />Highly recomend it
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|There are old favorites and new gems here. Dylan never disappoints. Another classic collection of musical Americana from the Great  American Troubadour. He turns his travels and memories and ideas into timeless melodies and poetry that will live forever. May he stay forever young.
0316074314|2.0|I love long books and I am a longtime fan of Victorian novels, so I thought this would be right up my alley. It turned not to be the case at all.  What I care about is a good story with lifelike characters.  Unfortunately, those are exactly the two points where Ms. Catton's book is weakest.<br /><br />Admirers of the book tend to be taken with its structure.  For example, the New York Times review says \\"[I]t's not even a novel in the normal sense, but rather a mass confabulation that evaporates in front of us, an astrological divination waning like the moon, the first section 360 pages long (or are those degrees?), the last a mere sliver.\\"  My feet are too firmly planted on the ground, I guess, because I felt it added nothing at all to the story that the parts got shorter and shorter as the novel went on, and I could see little that the astrological references had to do with the plot.<br /><br />This tale of the various residents, visitors and newcomers to a New Zealand gold-rush town in the 1860s is told in jumbled time fragments, with the last page taking us to the events immediately before the book's opening scene.  I normally enjoy non-linear storytelling, but I found it a lot less enjoyable in this case because the characters were so flat and there was so much jumping around just for the sake of jumping, or at least I could see no other good reason for it.  Worse yet, the author would suddenly lay out vast swaths of exposition, which to me, is a failure of storytelling.<br /><br />The author is certainly clever in a Victorian sort of way.  Her character names, for example; like Carver for a man with a large facial scar, Devlin for a clergyman, Mannering for a boor.  She follows the Victorian style of giving a pr&eacute;cis of each chapter's events at the top of each chapter.  That was occasionally entertaining, but as the chapters became shorter and shorter, the pr&eacute;cis became, instead, more exposition.<br /><br />I could see occasional glimmers of a brilliant novel. If only Catton were more skilled in characterization and dropped some of the structural gimmickry in favor of telling the story through the characters, rather than so much omniscient narrator exposition, this could have been a story with broad appeal.  As it is, though, I think it will have a far more narrow appeal.If only Catton were more skilled in characterization and dropped some of the structural gimmickry in favor of telling the story through the characters, rather than so much omniscient narrator exposition, this could have been a story with broad appeal.

B00BAXFECK|3.0|The first half of this book was somewhat interesting. No doubt about it, Donna Tartt is a fine wordsmith - a storyteller, but this book was filled with unlikeable characters. There was nothing to grab that really held my interest. By 2/3's in, I didn't care what happened to Theo - a despicable human being. And when Boris shows back up, I started to read every third page - just enough to move me to the end of the book. Great disappointment. It doesn't matter how big a talent you are, if the subject matter and the characters are bad - the story is also bad.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|No special effects,  no popular actors/actresses (although to me, Brendon Coyle / Downrton Abbey is one of my favorite characters) .This is a wonderful period film. Wonderful storyline, casting is beautifully done ... just a genuinely good story.  And a rather superficial thing . . . loved the clothes and the carriages
1568363931|5.0|I'm a college student at a university which has pretty bad and expensive food for lunches. Between this book and the author's website, it is a fantastic resource for easy, quick and delicious meals. I even end up eating leftovers or stock food for dinner from this cookbook. It also shows how to layout lunch boxes, and how to keep things healthy.<br /><br />I plan on using this book far after finishing university. I hope to get some more books to supplement the recipes. But this book is a fantastic starting point in ENGLISH. Most other books of this caliber are in Japanese.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|The interface is good, the physics are good, the feel is good, but the action at the corner pockets makes it easier to sink balls than real billiards. Other users' comments about game interruptions are spot-on, which is the only reason I don't give this five stars.<br /><br />Miniclip should make a 9-ball version!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Very good app to get and send yahoo.mail<br />Like it a lot for speed. Easy to delete old<br />mail items.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love my Kindle and I loved this book, can't wait to see it on the big screen! I would highly recommend this book!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This is a great book I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery awesome great fantastic and amazing book
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Provocative and engaging film about family relationships, love and compassion with superior performances by Matt McConaughey and child actors Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland.  McConaughy plays a scruffy, down-on-his-luck, aggrieved outlaw who charms and captivates the children to help him survive.  His disquieting, almost sinister yet ambrosial portrayal of a multi-faceted outcast is brilliant; he is transformed as a human being by his interactions with the children as much as they are transformed by him.  The plot isn't perfect but you will be astonished and captivated by the performances.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so cute and fun! everyone of all ages can become addicted in a good way :) its challenging so even adults wont get bored!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best thing I have bought in a long while.  Very easy to install the program on your computer.  We just open the program we want to watch, click on the desktop and there it is.  Awesome for the money.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|My kid really, really got an education of MJ with this one. DVD and CD! FABBB!!! Now this is real music!
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Great Movie with a great plot and twist. Liam Neeson is an excellent actor. Rarely is he in a bad movie. This is no exception.<br />I love a movie you can simply not figure out until the last moment it's revealed to you. Twists and Turns throughout the movie. a GREAT roll a coaster ride. I have watched this movie several times.
B000FA675C|2.0|Brown is a good writer and knows how to develop an interesting story.<br /><br />I thought his scholarship was shoddy and prejudicial. He takes what he wants from history and ignores the most consistent.<br /><br />I not only read the book but studied it to present a paper about it. He took a lot of liberties against Christ and Christianity to make up his story. I have no respect for a person who attacks a major portion of society for the sake of making a buck.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great Movie. Bought this for my wife as a chick flick. Found myself watching it several times.<br />Movie has s few gross scenes that could have been left out.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Excellent story lines and performances by all the cast.  Riveting.  Can hardly wait for the next episodes.  Julianne is a great actresses and perfect for the part.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|An Excellent sequel to the first. Non stop laughter throughout the entire movie, start to finish.. John Malkovich is my favorite actor. John is an one of the finest actors with the ability to flawlessly perform any roll he is placed in. John Carries the humor throughout the film. The other do contribute to the laughs and plot. But non come close to Malkovich.
B0035JNTA6|2.0|If you are extremely bored and saw all the silly movie, then you can watch this. I was doing other things and skipped through many parts.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|Stupid. This has to be the most mindless, ridiculous movie I have ever seen. How did this ever get produced. Think fines should be imposed on writers and producers for trying to sell this garbage to anyone.
B000001F7R|5.0|This is their first full album.  They released an EP on their own that is excellent also.  This album gives you a very good idea where Def Leppard came from musically and gives you a glimpse of what was to come!  I love this album, primarily because it's a group of guys determined to succeed, hungry for that success, and their tenacious drive to kick ass!  This album just seethes with the belief that if you work hard enough, rock hard enough, and don't let anything or anybody tell you different, you will become what you envision.  I could go through the songs and write about everything that makes them worthy of a good listen.  The album speaks for itself.  It rocks you right into the Masterpiece &#34;High and Dry&#34;, and I means rocks you there.  If you like Def Leppard even a little bit, this may just lead you into a new appreciation of a hard working  group of guys accomplished from the beginning.  I love this album!
B004KPQK2S|3.0|Worth watching, entertaining. A movie the whole family can sit down and watch, without worrying about language and adult scenes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting I really enjoy this game LOVE the fact it is free and I love that there are so many levels and that you keep adding to it
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Great read I'm about half way through. It's already changed my personal philosophy on running a company and seeking metrics to analyze my company's effectiveness. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to learn about running a startup business or to sharpen their business savvy in general.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|the super hero movies are fun but the body count in this one was very high . the chris reaves movies were more entertaining . i had commented on this movie the day it was released ,and was promptly bullied for my comment here at amazon . so i removed my comment . so person said i had never read a comic book before and that i was stupid . that's not true i read tons of comic books when i was young in the 60's . and you never saw sky high body counts in comics back then , property damage yes but 40 or 50 innocent folks in kansas . never in a million years .
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved this game so much. It makes you feel like a real detective. You get tons of clues that help you through to end up with an awesome, surprise, ending! So buy this one, it's so worth it, and you won't regret it.<br />Taya
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Good camera to record videos I like the fact that you can take a picture and instantly share it via Facebook instagram n so fort
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I really enjoyed these short stories about Harry Bosch. I read everything I can find regarding Michael Connelly best character. I wish he would write more short stories or a novella.
B003F3NDWG|1.0|The Castle series is fantastic- the cast ensemble has that chemistry that makes you want to keep watching more episodes. It's entertaining, the plot is always interesting, the characters are believable. It's one of those series that is right up there with Frasier, MASH, Cheers......
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Addictive :) Good graphics and elaborate story line! I would recommend  this game!!! :) You should give it a try, I think you'll enjoy it as well!!! ;)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|How dare you write such a touching book! The audacity to gently explain death without preaching. The boldness to be real in a book of fiction. The temerity to allow people a way to navigate feelings profound and private.<br /><br />Thank you, Joh Green. DFTBA
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This my third reading of this book.  What can I  say, it is the best  of its type.  You will never get tired of reading it, especially if you have some experience in the Far East and some interest in Japanese History.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I am a great fan of Pendergrast.  Love to hear more about<br />his life and assorted characters.  These two can reallywrite<br />a great story.
B0093LINVK|5.0|the ubuntu install was tricky just set bios to legacy<br />the intel ssd i install workes great and i loaded it up with 16 gigs of ram, great for internet surfing and occasional fap marathon.<br />the setup of the computer was really easy all you need is a small screw driver to screw in the ssd into the slot and to screw down ram took less then 3 minutes over all.
0385350864|5.0|I enjoyed it enormously. As much as the other two previous books. It is very touching, funny and just sounds very true to me. If you need a book to cheer you up and make you laugh out loud, this is the one.
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child is my favorite author and I love Jack Reacher books.  Child cannot write these novels fast enough for me!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it is the best game u could ever play it is great for little boys or girls it is easy and fun
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|It's a very good app, generally this apps only exists for root users, but AppMoster has advantages over other similar apps
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Works as advertised. Has good build quality and is easy to use. I  have used this cutter in the past and it is still great.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Absolutey entertaining. Another terrific read by Grisham. I couldn't put it down and as usual, fell in love with all the characters!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|best season yet. lots of surprises. more zombie action. yay. i love this show. even went to georgia to try to meet the cast.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|Doesn't work with Google Drive. Still has old documentation for Google docs. Everytime I linked the app with my drive, it froze.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie all the best characters together in one movie. Finally they cast the Hulk right which made the movie for me excited to see what happens in the next one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I think this game is a lot of fun in fact I think its better than Solitaire! Its great to play because it has the undo button and you can use hints.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched all seasons of Downton Abbey so far and am looking forward to the next one.  Very entertaining.  Beautiful sets.<br />Great actors.
B00E9HML1Q|3.0|I really was expecting more. The figurine is not up to par with what was packed with the Lord of The Rings. Looks cheaper and less detailed. The added scenes are not really relevant or long.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is fast easy to open and close. Bright. I use it often. When I need it, right there next to me.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Excellent of Susan Boyle, a pleasure to have a new CD as fyi package as had two the plastic cases were cracked...
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|One of the best Superman movies yet. Finally an explanation for where and how he got here. Cant wait for the next movie.
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|This charger will charge 1 device fairly quickly compared to other car chargers.  If you have two devices plugged in, the charging time is exponentially decreased.  If you have a device that has GPS enabled and are using Google Maps or Waze Nav software, this charger does not have enough power to charge the device.  The device will decrease in battery level slowly when GPS Nav software is enabled.<br /><br />Is this device worth $10.00 plus tax?????.....I would say that most car chargers are made poorly and are only worth at the very most $5.00.  This device is honestly worth about $6.00<br /><br />If the charger can charge two devices simultaneously with GPS turned on for both devices, then it would be worth the $10.<br /><br />FYI....I VERY RARELY write reviews.....
0762451319|5.0|For $9...it's totally worth it. You get a lot of stuff though they are like, mini items. But the necklace kicks ass
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great series and book. Well written and grabs you and keeps you interested. I couldn't put it down until it was finished
B001J6IKOC|5.0|Awesome series about a great bunch of Marines. The war may have been a mistake but the Marines did their jobs and won it by kicking Saddam's rear end.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Even better second book. The author does a great job of continuing to develop the characters and building upon the first book. It's an easy and fast read
1401941893|5.0|This was a great story about Miranda Kerr. Like my teens my daughter has been down in the dumps as well over her looks. This has motivated her to see that no matter what you look like someone else will always still have flaws. The read was interesting to find out how she made it in the business. But I thought it was more of a motivation book, My teen read it as well a liked her stories as well as her poems in the back of the book. Overall it was a fast read well written and I do like that it is about treasuring yourself. Great to have someone speak positive about themselves.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this game, much more than Temple Run. I feel there's more to it, and it truly keeps.me interested.
B000I9WWHW|5.0|to me this is the best Robin Williams ever made it is the perfect love story if you like the Notebook story you will love this story I never read the book but I don't want to after seeing this movie
B00F880BWG|5.0|Great show! Love the story line and its so great that you have no idea who is next to die.
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|I can't get enough of these action movies with these great action stars. This was funny and fun to watch.
B007XC9BSK|5.0|That's what my 2 year old thinks of Mack. He love displaying his micro drifters in this thing.<br />Also, makes it easy to count to see if he's missing one, so we can quickly decide when to check his little brother's mouth if one IS missing.
B0032SQCQI|2.0|This movie should have stayed a Twilight Zone episode. This was all over the place and not fun to watch. Now I know why it was not in Theatre's very long.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Nicely done Stephen. Enjoyed the read and found the book about as good as the original. Not quite as good, but close.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Finally Sailor Moon made it into action figure form took her long enough am i right? Well hands down it was well worth the wait to finally have her as an action figure. Everything about this figure is down right amazing. From the multiple faces to the two different moon sticks and too boot she even comes worth her lovable cat luna. I'd recommend this figure to each and every sailor moon fan out there this is a must buy.
B000063JZQ|4.0|Roman Polanski's MACBETH, a movie that really doesn't seem to fit as a great Shakespearean tragedy but rather as a grab for power in a den of criminals. If it hadn't been for the large army & the inclusion of the English as a party of interest you would never know that this involved a king & a kingdom.<br /><br />The lords are mainly ignorant & subject to their perceived lusts. Macbeth himself appears as a weak fool that latches onto augury as an excuse to perform his evil deeds. Having then done even one his mind breaks as he piles misjudgment on misjudgment on further augury. His wife, again a person of weak character & mental fortitude, basically piles shame on her husband's weakness only to snap suddenly and disappear into madness.<br /><br />There's no hero here, no divine justice or claim to honor. A bad man seeks & obtains that which he is unfit for. He is brought down by his enemies banding together as one would expect. The language is that of Shakespeare but the characters speaking them do not seem to be. A good king is destroyed by an evil & ambitious man who is destroyed by the good king's people in defense of their homes & selves. Still, there are some great lines such as \\"by the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.\\" The storyline is Shakespearean but the movie doesn't convey it well.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that the only characters in this story that get what they want are the witches. They wanted Duncan gone & whiz-bang, he is removed without them lifting a finger. I give it 3.5 Amazon stars for Polanski's direction & the wonderful dark images used throughout. Macbeth is not Hamlet but it is an OK told tale in this case. For those interested in battle scenes the personal combat at the end is striking!
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|It was bad acting and not believable ... The whole plot was a little dumb, and not worth your $5
B005JABU82|4.0|fairly awesome model. highly detailed and almost as good as perfect grade (even though it says perfect grade on the inner part of the box it is not perfect grade).<br /><br />CONS:<br />1)it falls apart fairly easy. I didn't find this to much of a problem, though, because I used cement glue on the parts that won't hold.<br />2) it is very fragile, I recommend using a tiny pair of pliers for removing the pieces from the brackets. I didn't do this and broke the crown piece to it.<br />3) the extra hands for holding the weapons, be extremely careful with them. in addition to the brackets, there are additional things hold the hand in place. use tweezers to remove it carefully<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) very high detailed<br />2) challenge but extremely fun to build.<br />3) Moving parts<br />4) Worth the price<br /><br />in all I say this is a good value. I would highly recommend it for fans of the series who love to build.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Have only played a short time but so far it's fun and moving right along. It remains to be seen if it will continue to move along without having to spend a bunch of money or not.
0062127241|5.0|This is not just a rock tell all by someone who wants not just to be a hero but to reveal his darker side. Excellent language, it did not exceed my expectation only because I knew Pete Townshend was capable of something this good.
B00A8307BG|2.0|Robin Trower amazed me with many songs from performances from albums such as Bridge of sighs, In city dreams and The King Biscuit Flower Hour best of Live!! I can see where a couple songs minus the vocals would make fine instrumentals released as a single from Roots and Branches. I had hoped to be amazed but Roots and Branches fall sharply short of the aforesaid albums.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Interesting story that moves briskly to keep one's interest; extremely well scripted; director kept the audience guessing as to the ending; expected Foster to do more in her role; it was a fun mystery.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Very delightful classic.  It draws you in so that you really want to know what is coming next.  Refreshing to read something not full of regrettable language.
0790731940|4.0|Fast movie action movie with lots of twists and turns.  Foster did a great job in her role.  She was surrounded by top flight male leads who also did a great job.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Well written and engrossing!  Looking forward to reading the 2nd book.  However most utopian/dystopian stories end tragically.  I'll be interested to see what new twists are introduced.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I have to love this for I am a die hard Led Zeppelin fan.  Jimmy  Page is my guitar God.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book told an interesting story and had a resolution at the end. A bit slow in some parts, but good overall.
0060922583|5.0|Excellent read.  However, it's a deep read and you must have high reading comprehension to understand the information.  Scientific point of view of the reality of what we are and what we are doing here.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Lots of fun for the whole family. I didn't get to play with it because it was shipped as a Christmas gift for a 9 year old boy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game keeps you on your toes and some levels you really have to think to find the right strategy to get through.  I really enjoy this game and and find the challenges fun.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It work great on my kindle fire. It does not glitches either. It is fun and a good game to kill time playing
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is the best with the descriptive mature language John Green provides for us readers. A poetic meaningful lines in a lot of this. I was so glad to give an Oral Book Report on The Fault In Our Stars. It wasn't one of you're &#34;Look I'm dying of cancer feel bad for me.&#34; No this was different. This was a tragic love story that you would've gotten. Every different emotions in it. These characters in here aren't any less human then we are they're all the same. Were all just people. Gods helping me trying to figure out what were all about since were one in the same. Same joy some pain. So I cried I laughed I was angry and that what makes John Green an Excellent writer. Best book I've read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It has a great plot. Brilliant story of love staying alive a dystopian community. If you loved this u have to read the divergent series. And the giver series.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I love this game. I stay glued to it pretty much all day long ever since it came out for kindle fire. Totally recommend this to all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay the Hunger Games series finale is a sad and captivating story. Making use of her talent and character Katniss is the perfect rebel to take down the Capitol. You should read this book.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|The fighting, movement, upgrade system and graphics are all up to standard for a fire HD game however there are a few kinks that need smoothing before I am able to give a better review. The movements of the characters are fine as is but could be allot better there are glitch frames where you can be nowhere near your enemy and still get hit or vice versa no reason I should be able to jab my opponent from across the room that's just wrong lol, however it won't let me Facebook connect and my biggest issue is the wait time after your power core has run dry. I'll clarify that my issue is not the actual amount of time, but mostly the fact that I cannot see how long it will take before I have all of my power core full again it would be better if could say ok it will be full in 2 hours go do something else come back and fight my next handful of matches that is all
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Wow! I decided to read this book for a history project at school but I never thought I'd get this into it! Wonderful story, it was so sad. And happy, too, I guess, and definitely nothing like anything I've read before. Amazing writing, love the classic style.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love this game because of the graphics and I love how you can own many robots. Although I think that they should add more energy. The graphics are SICK. I love this game.

B00EL6ACOI|5.0|The film Blackfish delivers a compelling and thought provoking display, revealing a darker depth of Seaworld to the general public who view the film. A good amount of people can admit to having memories of going to Seaworld at one point in time, either with their parents or their children. The movie reveals the shadowy truth of captivity, lingering out of sight, beneath the veneer of family entertainment and Seaword propaganda. It fist highlights this detail in the very beginning of the film by juxtaposing a recorded 911 emergency call, a call given for the death of a senior trainer at the hands of a whale, with scenes of a sea world public act and a commercial. The juxtaposition serves to underscore the grim divide between reality and sugarcoated fiction created by propaganda and public perception. From the greatest details such as the deaths and incidents of injury to the smallest, with the bottom half of the K in Blackfish shaped like a dorsal fin, the film is a superb example of a documentary film making. The bulk of the films testimonials come from former Seaworld trainers, while their recordings, photos, video clippings and diagrams are mostly from public record. The film and special features cover a host of issues created due to orca captivity. Issues from psychological trauma, encephalitis caused by mosquito bites and a significant decline in the quality of life the orcas experience. It covers many other issues as well, but the overall bottom line is the detrimental effects of keeping orcas confined to a liquid cage over time leads to a constant state of torture. The argument of the film boils down to a single fact, orcas are intelligent beings capable of complex emotions and social groups. As a film it is excellent, as a social statement about the injustice of captivity of intelligent animals it is equally excellent. As an avid film watcher and a fan of documentaries, I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in seeing the other side of Seaworld or curious to add a new documentary film to their collection. I also have absolutely no reservations whatsoever about giving this film a five star rating. If my long winded review still hasn't convinced you that it's an exceptional film, my advice is to watch the film and make up your own mind.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This is a very upbeat tune has a happy go feeling in my opinion the best song of the year . Has a retro 80s Eurythmics feel , David bowie yet with unique  todays Lady Gaga talent . This song is played in NFL touchdown themes . Very popular tune .
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Not as good as the game where you can visit neighbors but it is pretty good.  Actually better than some of the games out there.

0316219266|5.0|I found Brad Stone's book very readable and interesting. Some have questioned the accuracy of certain details and certain dates but I think these faults (if they exist) are more than offset by Stone's writing skills. Over and over through the story of Amazon I was struck by two aspects of Jeff Bezos. The first is that he is an amazing man with unbelievable energy and drive - he never seems to feel that enough is enough - Amazon must expand even further and dominate even more businesses. There is no limit. The second is that he also seems to be a flat person emotionally. Many have commented about his strange laugh and he seems to smile a lot. But there doesn't seem to be anything engaging about his personal thoughts or feelings. And he does not hesitate to be brutal with employees. I feel sorry for those who work under him - their hours are long and the criticism always just hovering and ready for striking.  There are many well-known people I would love to sit with over a glass or two of wine and discuss life and the universe we live in. But not with Jeff - I think he would probably dominate the conversation and just go on about his latest business triumph.
031623480X|2.0|These doctors are so funny! They can’t agree on how to interpret a huge amount of data current available, ready to be analyzed through the most modern statistical tools, and some of them want to convince you to do something based on what our ancestors allegedly did thousands of years ago (in this case, stick to a diet comprising 75% fat). I will not waste my time writing that the author fails to substantiate a lot of his claims. I will just highlight two passages.<br />The first on page 229: “Fasting is an excellent way to set the foundation and speed up your body’s shift to burning fat for fuel and producing biochemicals that have astonishing pro-health effects.”<br />The second on page 235: “Don’t eat erratically. Eat on a regular schedule. This will keep your appetite hormones in check. If you delay a meal too long, you will throw your hormones out of whack and trigger the nervous system, which can later impact your sleep.”<br />I rest my case.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan’s book is a compelling read. While it offers nothing new in its interpretations of the gospels, the book’s absorbing focus on the historical context is original and important. Aslan’s agenda is straightforward - a synthesis of historical information. The surprising result for me is that the religious and political history evoke a world and people who have more in common with Monty Python’s “Life of Brian” than the pieties you hear in Sunday sermons.
0767836324|5.0|If you've never seen it, this is a charming retelling of the Peter Pan story with a twist. Peter, played wonderfully by Robin Williams, is an adult and he doesn't remember that he's Peter Pan. Captain Hook played by Dustin Hoffman is deliciously and comically evil. This film has been a  family favorite since it came out in 1991, and it's wonderful to now own it and watch it again with my children, who are now adults, but still remember it most fondly.
B0000DI86O|3.0|Routine performance.  Giordano's opera deserves a more involved performance by Domingo and Sintrow. Zancanaro was fine as Gerard except that his voice does not have the &#34;heft&#34; for the part.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|This is a classic and I watch it every few years. Mostly I enjoy the music. Each time I watch it the scenarios seem less amusing and more sinister, and I am alarmed at the resemblance between early Nazi Germany and our modern culture. Was this what the artists had in mind? If so, they did a good job. The counterpointing of music and dance in the cabaret and the character's lives is excellent. Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey are superb.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|An outstanding film vision of Superman, and by far the best we have seen on the screen, big or small.  FAR better than the Christopher Reeves films -go back and watch them, even the first one.<br /><br />A smart and solid script coupled with very good acting.  The usual Superman tropes are there, handled in fresh ways to keep the jaded fans interested.  This film is not without its problems, but what film is?<br /><br />I would rate this between 4 and 5-stars, but opted for the higher rating to counter some of the low star spam and the bizarre comments.  I don't think that some of those people saw the same film...
B00632HWOG|3.0|I like it but I don't like having to scroll side-to-side just to read a message.  I was hoping for something more like what I get connecting to Yahoo mail on my PC.
B00C1S945G|4.0|Season 1 of TNG is pretty clunky.  In Season 2, one of the all-time great tv series starts to look a lot more familiar.  You get a lot more character development, Wesley Crusher's boy-wonder character is used in better and more realistic ways and minimized, Geordi and Worf, the actors who play them, begin to up their game and become more like real people.  Patrick Stewart (Picard) and Brent Spiner (Data) really find the essence of their characters here with the writers leaving PIcard's grumpy-old-man traits from season 1 behind in favor of the poet-archaeologist-diplomat that we all know and love.  &#34;Measure of a Man&#34; is the season highlight; it should have won a writing Emmy or acting Emmy or both.  It's a perfect hour of television.  There are hits and misses resulting from 1) rushed scripts due to a writers' strike and 2) the unsuccessful attempt to work Dr. Pulaski, an unlikeable character, into the cast, something that was rectified by writing the character out after a single season.  TNG doesn't really get going and start firing on all cylinders until Season 3, but there's a lot to love here and anyone interested in Trek should watch all of TNG in order, not go skipping around.  The HD/Remastered version is gorgeous.  Stunning quality.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|One of my favorite movies in our Blu-ray collection (186 and counting). There's an option to watch this in Saturday Movie Matinee style, that shows a cartoon and plays big band music prior to the movie starting. And what a great movie it is! By far the best Robin Hood movie ever made. Buy this Blu-ray and you'll be in like Flynn.
B00358ESI4|5.0|this is a really good movie.  it is like shakespearean modern military introspection.  equal to private ryan.  compare code talkers.
0375836675|3.0|This was a choice for our book club, otherwise I would not have read it. It is a book for young adults and shows the promise of Marcus Zusak's later book, the Book Thief, but he is not quite there. I didn't like the plot at all. Mysterious notes show up and the main character has to carry out the deeds? Then everything turns out okay due to his intervention? Sorry, but this just wasn't my kind of story. Other people in the club did like the book.
0385366450|3.0|pretty bland and totally predictable.....was hard to stay with the premise of the book, of course she was going to get the entire amount dictated in the will.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|This thing is way overpriced for what it does. That said, I always need to know things are going to work, always, so bit the bullet. It worked fine loaded with the Nikon EN-EL15 (regular battery for D800). My intent was to use this with the Wasabi EN-EL18 replacement for extra juice for the D800 using different carrier). Mixed results with that battery, but worked fine with the EN-EL18. And the Wasabi battery worked fine in the D4, so problem solved, and it has more power than the EN-EL18. The grip adds a lot of weight and size to the D800, but provided the extra power I was wanting for cold conditions. I didn't get the light to try out the extra frame performance, but will when I can.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The real question is why would you not love this? Except that I don't understand why someone doesn't beat Sheldon, Really. He drives the whole bunch of them crazy. Maybe that is why I love it.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|They worked as intended. One should buy a little case to put them in so that you can lose both at the same time.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|We'll written, fluid plot line.  Looking forward to reading the remainder of the series.  A very welcomed change to the traditional image of the vampire.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved that I couldn't guess how it would end. I loved the ending. In short I loved this book.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Well, I didn't realize that this is a super short story. No wonder it was so cheap! Great read ... but I wish it had been a book!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The first chapter does not tell the true story of the book believe me.  If sex is your thing then it is a good book for you.  Even then it is pretty sick.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|If it had been a bit longer I would have given it 5 stars, but the season was too short.
0770437400|3.0|This is a left coast/northeastern liberal'a view of a zombie war. The author clearly never grew up in a community with a lot of hunters, such as much of the South. Which might be why he ignores that entire region. The result would be much of the South would've been cleansed of the zombies in the world he creates, as would many, many other areas with strong hunting communities. The author lets his political views impede the telling of his story at points, and shows an ignorance and blindness on other subjects, other accidental or deliberate, to make the points he wants to make.<br /><br />Where it works is the personal tales. But while the movie's fast zombies have caused protests from purists, they actually offer an explanation as to why hunting communities could be overwhelmed, and work better from a logic standpoint.<br /><br />It's still a fun read, but go in knowing that this is a political book, not a zombie story.
B0038ZITIE|4.0|Fast shipping and great movie. Excellent soundtrack to compliment cheesiness and &#34;hot as I'll get out for the time Sam Jones&#34;. Not to be confused with Kim Cattrall's character from &#34;Sex and the City&#34;.
159102594X|1.0|I had been considering this trilogy for quite a while.  I am very glad I waited until I found them at a second-hand sale for $2 each.  I certainly would not have wanted to spend any more.<br /><br />This novel is part of the current trend towards gritty, hard-boiled fantasy.  In this case, it means you get a disjointed story where morally questionable characters complain about their painful torture wounds while inflicting torture on helpless victims for endless pages, and clumsy, hapless characters have a couple of fights in the filth and mud against dirty thugs with boils and running sores, and the heroes get cut falling over their own weapons, and everyone is either a completely amoral, despicable swine or a hapless oaf scrabbling to survive like a vagrant.<br /><br />I've read many reviews that claim this book has extremely detailed and vivid characters.  I beg to differ.  Taking a stock stereotype or a cardboard cutout and throwing on a variety of unwholesome or pathetic traits is NOT how to make a vivid, realistic character.<br /><br />Pretty much everything that makes heroic fantasy \\"heroic\\" and \\"fantastic\\" is done away with. There's no nobility, no heroism, no sense of wonder or magic.  The land this is set in is very drab and colorless.  There is no feel for the kind of culture this story takes place in.  It's just a generic, semi-magical medieval or renaissance European-derived place that adds nothing whatsoever to the story.  It's the literary version of a false-front movie set.  You do not feel like this land really existed before you opened the book.<br /><br />The author sees little point in using descriptive language, unless, of course, he is describing deaths or torture; This is his forte.  Then he gets pretty overblown.  We get scanty description of how the characters look and dress and what their world looks like, but we are shown in loving detail how a torturer chops a man's fingers into little slices that roll across a table.<br /><br />There is no real story at all.  The narrative is divided between the wanderings of a hobo/barbarian, the intrigues of a crippled, bitter torturer and the training of a decadent guards officer who is scheduled to enter a great fencing match.  The story goes like this: Chapter 1, hobo/barbarian fights low-lives in the mud and slush and gets injured when he falls on his knife and fumbles around in the wilderness.  Chapter 2, Crippled torturer complains about his agonizing pain and then tortures someone. Chapter 3, Guards officer practices fencing then gets drunk.  Repeat sequence until there are enough chapters to call it a book.<br /><br />The writing style is drab and poor.  Its awkward and repetitive use of certain phrases is painfully obvious.  I have read fan-fiction online that is much better than this.  Abercrombie tells us more than shows us about his characters.  If I was an editor, I would not have bothered with this book past the first page.<br /><br />My big question is this:  What exactly is the point of \\"gritty, hard-boiled fantasy\\" like this?  Fantasy is supposed to be a trip to mythic worlds with larger than life heroes and exotic settings.  Why bother to read something set in a sketchy, barely imagined grim depressing world with drab, unlikeable characters?  I have nothing against reading stories about \\"bad guys\\" but at least give them a fully described world. If you really want to read a book about shady characters in unglamorous settings why not read something set in the real world with a fully realized setting?  Or try a series like Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd & The Gray Mouser.  Leiber managed to convey a rugged, gritty setting while at the same time preserving a sense of wonder and magic AND a vivid, intriguing colorfully described world.<br /><br />With barely-there, unrealized backgrounds and little or no true fantasy elements, books like Abercrombie's are nothing more than showcases for violence, squalor and depravity with nothing extraneous like plot, characters or setting to get in the way.<br /><br />To sum up; If you like \\"fantasy\\" books where not much happens except lovingly described torture scenes and a few clumsy brawls against pathetic guys with boils and open sores; if you like those books to be set in totally generic colorless medieval pseudo-Europes; if you like your characters to be morally repugnant or hapless, if you hate colorful descriptive passages, then by all means pick up \\"The Blade Itself\\".  Other readers should look elsewhere or if you are curious, try to get them at a Goodwill or yard sale like I did.  They are not worth more than a buck or two.  I am not sure if I will bother to read the other two books.  I hear they get better, but I am not sure it's really worth it when there are so many better books to read.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very misleading.  They get you with the Google name, price, and 3-easy-step setup.  Easy? - I'm above-average in solving my pc problems, and spent too much time reading their massive online troubleshooter regarding the problems with my Verizon FIOS router (pretty common router for Google's product designers to screw-up this \\"handshaking\\" of hardware).  I sure got fooled! - don't be their next fool.  If Google wants ChromeCast to succeed, wait a few years for them to work the bugs out, and keep checking user reviews.  For now, you'd have to agonize over all the bugs yourself.<br /><br />After removing it from my TV to prepare it for return . . . my TV (4 years old) no longer picks up channels.  I had the TV auto-reprogram its channels, and all I'm seeing is snow on the screen.  Judge for yourself, product review readers.  I rarely write reviews, but sure hope this helps some of you.  10% of the reviews are 1-star, which for me is pretty bad.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is like Harry Potter and the Gods of Olympus. It's a growing-up story about a boy who discovers his origins and the dangers that come with it. Adults can enjoy it as well, a lot of it smacks of Neil Gaiman's &#34;American Gods.&#34;
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wasn't sure about the title at first - but enjoyed the book after all - again with good twists & turns of the plot.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the more addictive games I've played. love the bright colors!  Wish there was an option yo choose friends to gift lives on Kindle.
B003XURDAY|4.0|I watched this when it first came out and haven't seen it since. Rutger Hauer is quite the Hitler Youth and I found myself quite attracted to him. But I have daddy issues so we won't go there.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|This book is on a list of 1001 books to read before you die. One more complete. This is a classic horror novel. If you don't like horror novels, skip it. I had a hard time getting started but it got my interested and I am glad to have read it and not just to check it off the list
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is pretty cool. The only thing that I feel that could make it easier to play, is that it could be easier to regain your energy faster.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|This game is just all around a blast. It's easy at first, but progressively gets harder, and the boss battles are pretty intense if you dont have the right weapon. I have beaten the game a few times already and can say each time it was a blast.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. People are friendly but when I friend them they accept in my facenook but they don't get put on friends list in game? Can anyone help me?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is often quite cliche to say that you cannot put a book (kindle app?) down, but it is true for this title. The writer makes one feel part of the games. I read it to see if I would allow my 11 year old to read it. Now I can't wait for her to finish it to see what she thinks.
B004S3X9ZS|5.0|I love this record. It was recommended by my boyfriend Josh Homme on the Nerdist podcast. I love Josh Homme and would let him lead me into musical battle. He's my Braveheart. I plan on getting their other records because Josh Homme has a wonderful face to sit upon. Did I say that outloud?
B00280LYIC|5.0|I think this is a great book for kids around the age of ten. This book includes a lot of greek mythology that your kids learn while reading, it has action your kid would love, and act of friendship. You should get this book for your kid and get the series too
B002LL167W|5.0|The DVD product arrived on time and in perfect condition. However, I cannot play the DVD because it is of a different Region. That was my ordering oversight. MS

B00632HWOG|1.0|I hate the new yahoo mail SO MUCH.  Not only is the design crappy, it crashes on me a lot.  Unfortunately I have had my email address for over 10 years and I have a lot of things attached to it, so I am kind of stuck.

B00ELVVAG2|5.0|This is one of the best surround discs I've ever heard!  EVER.  It's absolutely stellar. 24/192 DTS-MA 5.1 as well as 24/192 5.1 and/or both in stereo as well. I've owned the DVD-A as well as the SACD, and I thought they were both great, but this is so much clearer!  I would give this more STARS if I could! If HFPA continues to release mixes like this, they'll have a great format!! Cannot recommend this disc enough!
B00DNDR29I|5.0|I enjoyed her last record. She can do no wrong in my book. If you enjoyed &#34;The Archandroid&#34; you won't be disappointed, although the radio station stuff might be a little off-putting. Could have streamlined this record a bit. But she's quirky and I like it.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Time Killer is a very compelling read.  I thought the timeline was too short.  There were many directions the detectives didn't have time to explore.  The result leaves them reacting instead of investigating.  While I generally prefer the investigating, the speed itself leads to a helplessness that aids in creating the sense of urgency.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Although this show has dragged on a couple seasons to long, I still love it.  Early seasons are better (same as most long running series) and I enjoy catching the reruns or just netflixing a few favorite episodes for a pleasant diversion. Season 9 has been funny and I can't wait for the moment Ted meets the mom.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love it! I was so happy to find this set. I can't wait for Season 4 to come out!
B00DMKFN34|4.0|The comments about this version's packaging is correct.  The outer box is missing for a normal Disney special edition.  An oversight by Amazon?  I think if you want the full packaging, then buy elsewhere.  As for the digital copy, it is through digitalcopyplus.com and the pop-up takes you to iTunes to download.  It seemed to work fine.  Overall a great movie for families with kids who are Cars fans.
0385537131|1.0|This book is more about lame characters drinking coffee every other moment and white guilt than contesting a will.  I was hoping for more.  Wait Jake just went to the coffee shop and Dell poured him some coffee and a refill… after he woke and made some coffee at 5AM.  The ending was a total let down.  It is a perfect script for a movie on Lifetime network though.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I loved the first movie and love this one as well. Decided I love Benedict Cumberbatch because of this and spend time trying to say his name correctly to eager single women. His mouth is weird but he has a nice voice. Chris Pine, on the other hand, can pet my cat.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this black-and-white classic...<br /><br />The Elephant Man (1980) stars John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, and John Gielgud.  This movie, directed by David Lynch, was filmed in black-and-white, unusual for a movie made in 1980.  However, black-and-white was THE way to film this.  From a psychological standpoint, black-and-white fits the story so well.  This movie is about Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed human oddity who lived in late nineteenth century England, and what he went through during his life.  I don't want to give away too much, you'll have to watch it for yourself.  The acting is great, especially by John Hurt, who plays the lead role.  A younger Anthony Hopkins also gives a great performance as Merrick's doctor.  This movie has great cinematography throughout.  The musical score is good as well and is used sparingly throughout the movie.  This movie was nominated for 8 Academy Awards, but didn't win any.<br /><br />I consider this movie a masterpiece.  See it.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This show  has it all - action, drama, intrigue, romance, a little sci-fi.  I am dying for season 3 to be released. And considering getting HBO so I can watch the show live rather than waiting.<br /><br />Definitely R rated - not for the kids
B0093X805W|5.0|It was one of the best books ever. I think about it every day. It was amazing. I love it.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|Free download and free coins from Amazon.  Spent a few minutes with it, following the directions.  What is the object of this game?  My attention span was short on this one.  Guess I could spend a little more time getting to know it.  Just not today.  Will have to think about it.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|I got this movie because I remember it from my childhood.  Enjoyed watching it again, hoping my kids will one day enjoy it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Does exactly what I need, with lots of options to meet my needs.  I have a dozen alarms set for various days, and never have to reset my clock.  I never even use my regular alarm clock anymore.  And I love the alarm option of random song by artist.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Its pretty much a good game. Its very fun,it also has an ok graphic to. but one mastake is that it goes back to the home page every time I play it!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What can I say about Angry Birds that hasn't been said a million times?  Highly addicting and super fun. Down with the green piggies!
B009LGO88E|5.0|Works like a charm even on my EU 3DS XL. As expected there are no compatibility issues. I find it really useful in the games that support it, and it makes the 3DS feel better in my hands
B000L3CHC0|1.0|very thick for its size which some reason looks bigger in the pictures but in real life this watch is tiny, to a point that it almost looks like a ladies watch. Also the quality of the band wasn't up to par. it felt light and cheaply made which made me think the one I bought was a fake.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Creative original ideas.<br />Lot's of action, twists and turns.<br />Reader can see that Katnis is talented, dedicated and determined, but fallible, and doesn't always understand events correctly.
0062107313|3.0|I enjoyed the basic story, and the overarching structure was certainly indicative of Amy Tan. In the end, however, I was somewhat disappointed. This novel is missing the rich symbolism, deep characters, and vivid imagery that made her earlier novels so wonderfully captivating. Some parts seem rough and disjointed, while others meander about without adding any substance to the tale.<br /><br />While I don't necessarily regret the purchase of this book, I would hesitate to recommend it to a friend. Even Saving Fish from Drowning was better written.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Great mystery and escape to another place and time!  The characterization is excellent--the people seem very real, ones that you know and don't want to leave.
030758836X|4.0|I was super stoked to find Gone Girl at a used bookstore.  Talk about a page turner. There were times when I literally couldn't put this book down.  Broken into three parts, the first part seems like a standard whodunit mystery, but the second part slams you hard and makes you rethink everything you just read.  Like another reviewer stated the third part is not the most satisfying conclusion to this tale, it seems like the author had this great plot and no really good idea how to resolve it.  Even though the ending wasn't what I had hoped for (I don't even know what I did hope for!) this book is a must-read.<br /><br />The author's voice is smart and acerbically funny.  The main characters, Nick and his wife Amy are both pretty hateable but it's a true testament to the author that you want to keep reading despite being appalled at both of them.<br /><br />ETA: A lot of foul language - I know this turns off many people so beware.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't have cable, this fills the gap and is so convenient with netflix and the utube I have tried.  Fabulous with netflix.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Simply amazing stuff! I enjoyed all 15 hours of content (3 hour movie, 3 hour movie with directors/writers commentary/9 hours of supplemental material). A must-have for any fan of Tolkien, Jackson, or these amazing movies. Am hoping that with &#34;The Hobbit: There and Back Again&#34; scheduled for a Summer 2014 release, that the next extended release will come this spring, rather than next November.<br /><br />One point I will make is that the format of the supplemental materials in these extended releases are different than was that case with LotR. There is only the one commentary track (instead of four). There is no included map to the discs (arguably unnecessary). The supplemental materials themselves are more cohesive than I what I recall from LotR (single &#34;Play All&#34; functions capture everything). I'm also slightly disappointed that the disc cases are of an inconsistent design compared with the Blu-Ray extended releases of LotR. But perhaps that's also intentional... at one moment during the director's commentary, there is a portion where a drop-in was clearly added mentioning a future 6-movie Hobbit+LotR release, which would include yet additional content not released as part of the separate extended releases of the individual films. So... we shall see what the future holds!
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Entertaining for those that like SciFi. movies.  This one is set in the cowboy days, which is a switch from the others.  It is better than OK for me, not too silly/goofy to watch to the very end. If I could, I would have given it a 3 1/2 stars.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I read It decades ago, and was enthralled with the book. Having just re-read The Shining, which was a wild ride, I decided  to tackle  It again. So glad I did, the book was delicious and I had nightmares afterwards. Having been a loser in school, the bullying was real to me. King seems to understand the life of a social outcast.  Yeah, it is very long, but I never even considered putting it down. Lay down your grown up concepts of reality and jion the fun.
B0049P1VHS|1.0|Best show on TV Period .<br />Ordered season's one and two . My favorite show<br />So surprised after checking reviews for a while , no one commenting on the picture quality of both seasons one & two on dvd . They are absolute Horrid .<br />How is that even possible .<br />I recently ordered ( Netflix ) season 3 and there is a Mass improvement on picture quality .<br />Avoid seasons 1 & 2 on dvd for now unless your getting them on blu ray .

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth by Reza Aslan<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is about the history of Jesus of Nazareth not the story of the Christ.  The book is based on the two known hard facts about Jesus of Nazareth: first is that Jesus was a Jew who led a popular movement and second that Rome crucified him for doing so.  Dr. Aslan, a religious scholar builds his narrative around the aforementioned facts within what is known of that tumultuous time period and region of the world.  What is uncovered is a Jesus that is accessed by historical means.  This interesting 336-page book includes fifteen chapters broken out in three parts: 1. A Different Sort of Sacrifice, 2. Zeal for Your House, and 3. God Made Flesh.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. A well-written, accessible book. An astute and practical approach to the book that matches his target audience of the general public.  Dr. Aslan does not belabor his points; he makes his points succinct and clear within the historical framework of the culture of that time period.<br />2. I find religion to be one of the most interesting topics.  The author takes great care in being fair and treating the topic with utmost respect but is not afraid to show discrepancies and weaknesses in scripture as it relates to what we know of the time period and culture in which these alleged events took place.  I consider this to be one of the biggest strengths of this book.  Acknowledging our shortcomings of knowledge and making inferences based on the best historical information we have.<br />3. Dr. Aslan is a religious scholar and has great command of the topic.  This book provides lengthy notes for anyone interested in further research.<br />4. Don't underestimate a good Chronology, very helpful reference.<br />5. Excellent balance of scripture, historical references and enough skepticism that lead to reasonable inferences.<br />6. I like how the author gets to the heart of the matter and doesn't belabor the point.  Many books of this ilk go off tangents and lose the general target audience by boring them with minute unnecessary details. \\"In first-century Palestine, simply saying the words `This is the messiah,' aloud and in public, can be a criminal offense, punishable by crucifixion.\\"  And that's precisely what gives the book a good flow and makes the reading experience a good one.<br />7. The Fourth Philosophy movement and what sets them apart from the other three major philosophies of that time.<br />8. Prefect Pontius Pilate in proper historical perspective.  \\"The gospels present Pilate as a righteous yet weak-willed man so overcome with doubt about putting Jesus of Nazareth to death that he does everything in his power to save his life, finally washing his hands of the entire episode when the Jews demand his blood. That is pure fiction.\\"<br />9. Interesting history of uprisings and the movements behind it.  \\"The Sicarii were zealots fueled by an apocalyptic worldview and a fervent devotion to establishing God's rule on earth. They were fanatical in their opposition to the Roman occupation, though they reserved their vengeance for those Jews, particularly among the wealthy priestly aristocracy, who submitted to Roman rule.\\"<br />10. Dr. Aslan states his case clearly and builds from there. \\"But look closely at Jesus's words and actions at the Temple in Jerusalem--the episode that undoubtedly precipitated his arrest and execution--and this one fact becomes difficult to deny: Jesus was crucified by Rome because his messianic aspirations threatened the occupation of Palestine, and his zealotry endangered the Temple authorities.\\"<br />11. Setting the story of John the Baptist straight. \\"Alas, the gospel account is not to be believed. As deliciously scandalous as the story of John's execution may be, it is riddled with errors and historical inaccuracies.\\"<br />12. Interesting insights into the development of Jesus's movement.  \\"Jesus was a peasant. He spoke like a peasant. He taught in Aramaic,the common tongue. His authority was not that of the bookish scholars and the priestly aristocracy. Their authority came from their solemn lucubration and their intimate connection to the Temple. Jesus's authority came directly from God.\\"<br />13. The magical world of those tumultuous times. \\"Simply put, Jesus's status as an exorcist and miracle worker may seem unusual, even absurd, to modern skeptics, but it did not deviate greatly from the standard expectation of exorcists and miracle workers in first-century Palestine.\\"<br />14. The central theme of Jesus's message, \\"Of this there can be no doubt: the central theme and unifying message of Jesus's brief three-year ministry was the promise of the Kingdom of God.\\" \\"Jesus recognized that the new world order he envisioned was so radical, so dangerous, so revolutionary, that Rome's only conceivable response to it would be to arrest and execute them all for sedition. He therefore consciously chose to veil the Kingdom of God in abstruse and enigmatic parables that are nearly impossible to understand.\\" Great stuff.<br />15. The main obstacles facing the early church, \\"The problem for the early church is that Jesus did not fit any of the messianic paradigms offered in the Hebrew Bible, nor did he fulfill a single requirement expected of the messiah. Jesus spoke about the end of days, but it did not come to pass, not even after the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and defiled God's Temple. He promised that God would liberate the Jews from bondage, but God did no such thing. He vowed that the twelve tribes of Israel would be reconstituted and the nation restored; instead, the Romans expropriated the Promised Land, slaughtered its inhabitants, and exiled the survivors. The Kingdom of God that Jesus predicted never arrived; the new world order he described never took shape. According to the standards of the Jewish cult and the Hebrew Scriptures, Jesus was as successful in his messianic aspirations as any of the other would-be messiahs.\\"<br />16. The significance of the Temple.  \\"The Temple is the chief civic and religious institution of the Jews. It is the sole source of the Jewish cult and the principal symbol of Rome's hegemony over Judea. Even the slightest threat to the Temple would instantly arouse the attention of the priestly and Roman authorities.\\"<br />17. The role of punishment. \\"Simply put, crucifixion was more than a capital punishment for Rome; it was a public reminder of what happens when one challenges the empire. That is why it was reserved solely for the most extreme political crimes: treason, rebellion, sedition, banditry.\\"<br />18. The reality of the resurrection. \\"The fact remains that the resurrection is not a historical event. It may have had historical ripples, but the event itself falls outside the scope of history and into the realm of faith.\\"<br />19. A good job of describing those behind defining Christianity, \\"The discord between the two groups resulted in the emergence of two distinct and competing camps of Christian interpretation in the decades after the crucifixion: one championed by Jesus's brother, James; the other promoted by the former Pharisee, Paul.\\"<br />20. The major role that Paul played. \\"For it was Paul who solved the disciples' dilemma of reconciling Jesus's shameful death on the cross with the messianic expectations of the Jews, by simply discarding those expectations and transforming Jesus into a completely new creature, one that seems almost wholly of his own making: Christ.\\"<br />21. \\"James the Just\\" plays a major role and thankfully so. \\"James was more than just Jesus's brother. He was, as the historical evidence attests, the undisputed leader of the movement Jesus had left behind.\\" His philosophy, \\"James goes so far as to suggest that one cannot truly be a follower of Jesus if one does not actively favor the poor.\\"<br />22. Extensive notes and formal bibliography.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. More visual material would have been helpful.  Theauthor provides a sketch of the Temple of Jerusalem and that was very helpful more visual aid of that sort would only have added value to the book.<br />2. An appendix that summarizes the approach by the four gospels would also added value.<br />3. From time to time the author states what biblical scholars have consensus on.  Once again, it would benefit the layperson to know what the scholarly biblical consensus is on the main issues the author presents in the book.  This could have been done in the form of an appendix to keep from affecting the flow of the narrative. It would be interesting to see where Dr. Aslan's views differ or agree with regards to his fellow scholars.<br />4. Avid readers of this genre will not find much new or surprising in this book.  The best marketing the book received was that supposedly ill-fated interview from Fox.<br /><br />In summary, this was a surprisingly interesting and fast-paced book.  For the record, I'm a non-believer in all supernatural agents and in particular one that endorses slavery.  The one thing I do share with Dr. Aslan is my admiration of philosophy that inspires good.  In particular, I have regained a newfound admiration for Jesus's brother \\"James the Just\\" his emphasis of helping the poor resonates.  Dr. Aslan should be commended for providing readers with a succinct, well-researched and enlightening book that will satisfy believers and well people like me.  There is nothing really earth-shattering new here but what's here is well-researched and done so succinctly.

B0059XTTW8|5.0|I am a great fan of John le Carre's cold war spy novles, and I have read his \\"TTSP\\" twice (or was it three times?). I have also seen the BBC's multipart adaptation for TV (1979), starring Alec Guinness as the Brit spy master George Smiley, in its entirety at least 3 times. In this film version, I found actor Gary Oldman's portrayal of Smiley to be superb (as, apparently, did le Carre himself, judging by comments that Le Carre himself made about Oldman's portrayal). There are some (more or less) significant discrepancies in plot between this version and le Carre's novel (as well as the BBC's adaptation -- which followed the novel very closely but which lasts 3 times longer than this recent film adaptation starring Gary Oldman). Some differences between this new adaptation and le Carre's novel: in the novel, Czechoslovakia doesn't play into it. Instead, the Brit spy Prudeaux goes to meet the defector in Budapest, Hungary. In the novel, the Soviets (ie, Karla) are more subtle in covering their bases when they realize that one of their trade delegates intends to reveal the identity of their mole (in this newest film version, the Soviets brutally murder signalsman Tufty Thessinger and disembowel the husband of a traitorous woman trade delegate in a bathtub -- in the novel, neither killing ever happen - the novel [and the BBC's TV version, which followed the book very, very closely], the long arm of Soviet espionage is more subtle and, for that reason, more frighteningly insidious -- this insidious quality of Karla's methods is even more  well displayed in the BBC's multipart TV version of the second novel in le Carre's Smiley-Karla saga, entitled \\"Smiley's People\\"). All that being said, I really, really liked this new version of TTSP. There are very nice touches in this film (eg, after the aging Control's death from natural causes in hospital, Smiley [who by this time had been forced into retirement from the British intelligence services] goes with his loyal intelligence-operator/helpmate Peter Guillam to inspect Control's flat. Some files are found sitting in a cardboard box on a table. There's an old label on on the side of the box. The label reveals that originally, what came in that box was a phonographic turntable. A quick Internet search reveals that the make and model of that turntable roughly corresponds to the time at which the events in this film are taking place. And in the very first scene in the film, which involves Control, he is listening to a phonographic record. The film is full of nice little touches like that. There are some things in the way this film handles le Carre's narrative that I don't particularly like (eg, in this new film version, le Carre's character Toby Esterhase, who is by birth a Hungarian and who is ethnically a Magyar, is somewhat ambiguously recast as \\"Toby Esterhouse\\" [albeit, for some reason, Internet sources such as IMdB and others continue to spell this character's name as the name is spelled in le Carre's novel -- nevertheless, in this new film version, the pronunciation you hear spoken by the characters is very much Anglicized, unlike in the BBC's versions of TTSP and Smiley's People); for me, Esterhase has always been one of the more interesting characters in the Smiley-Karla narrative (I hear echoes of Esterhase's voice in certain words spoken by characters in the current Showtime Network TV drama, \\"Homeland\\" -- a drama that I've noticed has borrowed a few things from le Carre's Smiley-Karla narrative), but in this new film version, he is characterized in a very different way with virtually no backstory (of course, to get all of these elements into the movie would make the movie 6 hours long). Another thing is the way this new film portrayed Smiley's wife, Ann -- a relationship which is really very important to le Carre's narrative. In this film, Ann is almost invisible except as a kind of \\"tart-icon\\" (I'm thinking in particular of how she is portrayed during the MI5 Christmas party). But again, if you want to make a 2-hour film version of TTKS, you're going to have to leave a lot of le Carre's narrative sitting on the cutting room floor. (On the other hand, I found the way this new film portrayed the character of Connie Sachs interesting. Before Connie was forced into retirement prematurely, she was an intelligence analyst who was affectionately referred to by colleagues as \\"Mother Russia\\" because of her encyclopedic knowledge of Soviet political-espionage arcana. In le Carre's novel, Connie is a really interesting character. Her portrayal in the BBC (6-hour) version is arguably the \\"reference standard,\\" but this new film's portrayal is really interesting, and it would be hard to say what it is about the characterization in the 6-hour version that is absent in this new adaptation.)<br /><br />Despite all these \\"problems\\" (mostly involving what the director of such a film version is going to include and what he or she is going to omit),  I really, really like this new version -- I really like Gary Goldman as Smiley. I really do. I think he's great as Smiley. I'd like to see more of him as Smiley. There's a quietness to his Smiley that kind lends a sense of the inevitable in what goes on. (That quietness is never more eloquent than when, after Smile's orchestrated the capture of the mole and the mole has been thoroughly interrogated by the inquisitors and Smiley is speaking with him for one last time, the mole tells Smiley in the most sincere, plaintive voice that he became a Soviet agent in order to make a difference, to be \\"important\\" - the little glance that Smiley then gives the mole is truly eloquent --  I doubt any actor could have delivered that glance better than Oldman did -- and in my view, it was thoroughly le Carresque.<br /><br />Underlying the tension in this movie is a quiet sense of pathos that gives this film a richness that I don't see in any other political/espionage and that seems to me to be very much in accord with the feel ofle Carre's cold war novels (and which is also permeates his novel \\"Little Drummer Girl,\\" which is a really extraordinary novel about political terrorism published in 1983).<br /><br />If you know le Carre's novels, I think you'll find this film adaptation interesting (and you just may love it).

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a fast reading book because of the interest and discriptions of Dr. Alexander.  I can see how this experience would be life altering.  I really enjoying the experience he shared with readers.  Thank you.
0802473156|5.0|Love this book! It really made a great improvement to my relationship and would defiantly recommend reading it, even if you just want to improve yourself.
B00471TLZS|4.0|Good, old school scary flick.  I was terrified by this movie as a kid.  It was fun to revisit the thrills.
B000LE16VW|5.0|It was so good. I cried at the end. It was multifaceted. It was a love story, a mystery and a comedy. Whoopi Goldberg was very funny.
0688010377|5.0|Read this as a child and liked it alot. Reread it as an adult and still like it alot. Ms. Stewarts writing skills improved over the years and this one was early. Still a good story!
B007I2BYX0|5.0|This is a short release, but if you like &#34;Light Me Up&#34; then it really is a must own.  &#34;Hit Me Like a Man&#34; is more of the same and I mean that in the best possible way.  There are a few different directions explored in the abbreviated set, but the core Taylor Momsen experience is pretty much the same.  And therefore I'll repeat my only criticism of their full length release.  This music needs some guitar solo action!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is cute so far. My only complaint is I hate buying extras for games every time I w ant to do more. I am fine for a few things. Just not every time I want something. But other then that it's a cute game.
1423136802|5.0|My seven year old is reading this series. Since it was his first completed novel all by himself like a big boy--I purchased the whole set for him. Great way to keep the memories of his first big books.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|Son was so excited to get this! He never knew Lego made Back to Future stuff. I knocked one star off because the front says Back to the Future, but we ended up with the Back to the Future Part 2 car. I wanted to start with I, then II, then part III of the cars. Oh well. It's still pretty cool. Who knows, it might even be a collectors edition someday.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|As with the preceding books of the trilogy, I found the story filled with satisfying twists and turns through Scalzi's compelling and well conceived science-fiction universe.  The author strikes the perfect balance between detailed and breezy, and between humorous and intense.  The characters, some new faces included, feel genuinely human, and connect the reader to some of the more alien elements of such a far flung world. You will not find too much delving into the depths of philosophy, but rather just enough to make you think a bit, and to provide a sense of wonder all the while enjoying a high-adventure paced story that reads quite quickly.
B001FB5634|4.0|Love Viggo and his soft spoken voice. The ending was so very sad but that is all I will say. The horror of the lives the survivors are forced to live and what some will resort to keep themselves alive.
B0001GL3K4|1.0|Purchased this and it had a lot of scratches on it.  Movie would play right.  Just throw it away and went and bought a new one.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Somewhere I saw this listed as a book for children.  It doesn't seem that way to me.  Very well written story of a grown man revisiting the area near where he grew up and where, when he was seven, he had a most frightening adventure at the end of the lane.  Part myth,  part an exploration on memory, part what it means to look back on your childhood.  Absolutely lovely.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My daughters loves Legos and minecraft. Have both in one box totally surprised her and she loves it. Very detailed.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This series is a great for any family.  It is nice to have a show that doesn't require that you have to wait to watch with pre-teens.  This show some great struggles that we are then able to take away and discuss as a family.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Worst book I have ever read. I have never read the third book of a trilogy that was more disjointed that this. It honestly felt as if Veronica Roth didn't write this book. The style was completely different than the other books. They finally get to the outside world and it was SO BORING! It just never took off. And then,,,, I won't say it, but the worst ending ever. I can't discourage readers enough but to say &#34;don't even waste your valuable time on this book!&#34;. Veronica- you really should be ashamed to attach your name to this and to take our money for this book. Your editor should be ashamed. And you really let this fan down. What a huge disappointment.
1451627289|5.0|A good read. I love Mr. King and his stories! I was 9 years old when Kennedy was murdered. My mom was a huge Kennedy fan and cried for weeks after. I remember how horribly this affected everyone, even us kids and our day to day lives. This book is about a subject that many of us old folks are quite familiar with, and this is an interesting fictional spin on the subject. I recommend it as a good read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another page turner from Mr. Grisham. Thoroughly enjoyable. Can't wait for his next novel to be published. Hurry up John.
B005PK56TA|5.0|It was so spooky and weird and kept you on the edge of your chair.  Looking forward to Season 2.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It is not the product I want to comment about but the nice lady that helped me so much to obtain both of these items I had a gift card and it lacked a little being enough so she managed to work it out so I had enough I'm sorry I don't remember her name but she was the nicest lady I have ever dealt with.
0316055433|1.0|No payoff.  Enticing setups lead to let downs.  Painstaking details amount to nothing.  Disappointing after good reviews made me want to like it.
B00FY2UFRM|3.0|Where's the $4.99 rental option?? same with a lot of movies like Flight, The Wolverine, Red 2 etc.<br />Already disappointed they keep raising the rental prices from $3.99 to $5.99.

B00EUGYM04|5.0|I'm the kind of music fan that pays close attention to the bands I like.  I always remember which songs are released as singles, whether they become major hits or not.  Every time a band puts out a &#34;greatest hits&#34; album or a &#34;best of&#34; album, they ALWAYS end up leaving off some key songs.  I'm not saying that EVERY single has to make the cut, but at least get all of the successful hits!  Nope, they always leave off 1 or 2 major hits just to anger you enough to go out and buy one more thing to round out your collection.  After all, most of these compilation albums are put together by the record company, the band rarely has much involvement.  Not in this case, though!  Seether did the incredibly obvious thing to do, which also happens to be something very rarely done... THEY PUT EVERY SINGLE ON HERE!&#34;  I've been listening to these guys since a couple weeks before their first album was released, and I can tell you that they didn't miss anything here.  The first album (Disclaimer) is represented with Fine Again, Driven Under, and Gasoline.  The version of Broken on here is not the original album version; it's the more popular re-recording that they did with Amy Lee from Evanescence.  Then the second album (Karma & Effect) is represented with Remedy, Truth, and The Gift.  From the third album (Finding Beauty In Negative Spaces) we have Fake It, Rise Above This, Breakdown, and the cover of Careless Whisper which was released on later pressings.  Finally, the band's fourth and most recent album is represented with Country Song, Tonight, Here And Now, and No Resolution.  These are all fantastic songs (although I was never crazy about Careless Whisper), and I think this will make all you casual Seether fans very happy!  However, don't be scared to check out the band's individual albums, which are all very solid.  After all, some really great songs like Sympathetic and Fur Cue never made it to the radio.<br /><br />However, things don't end there.  We get a whole other disc containing B-sides and other rare songs from the band.  This is cool for devoted Seether fans like myself, but it would make more sense to release this seperately.  Obviously this was packaged together to ensure sales from both casual AND diehard fans of the group.  (This was probably the record label's idea.)  Oh well, at least the price is cheap!  This disc begins with a cover of Seether, a song originally recorded by Veruca Salt and most likely the inspiration for the band's name.  It sounds pretty good, but it seems a little mellow and I was thinking the band was really gonna rock out with it.  Then there's Safe To Say I've Had Enough and Weak, which I believe are both newly recorded songs.  Out Of My Way and Hang On were recorded for movie soundtracks, but I don't understand why they put these on here since they were included on Disclaimer II.  We also have Let Me Go from the Remedy single, and No Shelter from the NCIS soundtrack.  The rest of the songs are demos from various points in the band's career.  All of this stuff is pretty good if you're a fan of everything else from Seether, it's just nice to have some lost gems.<br /><br />This will make a great Christmas gift if you know a big Seether fan out there, or anyone who likes modern mainstream rock.  Let's give a round of applause to Seether for putting together a collection of popular songs that is solid and complete!whole other disc containing B-sides and other rare songs from the band.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|I like the book. I thought the plot was a bit too fast and twisting, The ending was a tough way to end the trilogy, but this was a tough times trilogy.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This is very good collection if you don't already own these movies seperately because it is a good deal I have read other reviews of the quality but for the age of the movies beside rocky balboa they are pretty good on blu ray. It does have some grainyness to the picture but that's how the film always has been and there's no way to fix that but sound and quality are great for a collection at this good of a price.I recomend it. Yo Adrian!
B00448SE4S|5.0|This movie is very underrated. When I was still living at home post-college, my brother and I were both given flyers to see this movie for free. We both thought, hey, free movie! From the opening 8-bit Universal Studios credits to the end of the movie, we had a blast.<br /><br />Michael Cera isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I think he's a funny actor. There isn't a weak link in the cast. Aubrey Plaza, Anna Kendrick, and Kieran Culkin all shine in supporting roles. Edgar Wright, the director, has an obvious passion for popular culture, and he inserts clever references with reckless abandon throughout the movie. The soundtrack is also a treat!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I gave it a five star rating because it deserves it. While I was not happy with some of the twists and turns it was well written and had a well thought out plot. I would recommend to any one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good read keeps your interest recommend to young adults and adults as is very violent. Can't wait for the movie
B00FFERTUK|5.0|Nickelback has been subject to much criticism and jokes, and I'm sure that's mostly because of how incredibly popular they became.  A lot of people wouldn't like to admit it, but Nickelback is a very talented rock band.  They're kinda like an '80s hair band in the sense that half their songs are about sex and partying, while the other half are ballads and love songs.  If you think about it, they have the spirit of classic rock and roll as much as any other band has, and they deliver incredible live shows with all the pyrotechnics and guitar/drum solos you can shake a fist at.  This hits collection seems long overdue, because every album they put out has so many hits and singles on it that it would be impossible to squeeze everything on one CD now that they've been in the mainstream for 13 years!  However, I'm impressed that they didn't get cheap and gave us a collection with a whopping 19 tracks!  There are no new songs, remixes, or basement demos on here.  That stuff is just a cash grab so the diehard fans will buy it too, but this is directed straight to casual fans.  There's nothing new on here for me, but I respect that this was put together the way a \\"best of\\" collection truly should be.<br /><br />All of the band's biggest hits seem to be here, and then some!  We have How You Remind Me which threw the band into mainstream success, and all of the similar sounding hits that came after like Someday, Photograph, and Savin' Me.  There's also the mid-tempo ballads that get everyone at the concerts singing along like Rockstar, Gotta Be Somebody, and When We Stand Together.  The group's heavier side is represented with Burn It To The Ground, Something In Your Mouth, and Never Again.  All of the ladies' favorites are here like Far Away, If Everyone Cared, Lullaby, and If Today Was Your Last Day.  The collection is rounded out with other staples like Too Bad, Feelin' Way Too Damn Good, Figured You Out, Animals, and This Afternoon.  That's a pretty thorough set!  So what's missing?  Well, the earliest songs on this set are from their 2001 album, Silver Side Up, so you won't find anything before that.  I was a little bummed to see that Leader Of Men and Breathe didn't make the cut, which were the first songs I ever heard by them back in early 2000.  They also chose not to include Bottoms Up or Trying Not To Love You, which are both from their most recent album (Here and Now) and they probably didn't want to hurt the sales of that record.  There's also a short list of less popular singles that didn't make it on here like See You At The Show, I'd Come For You, and Never Gonna Be Alone.  I don't think we expected those to make it on here though, there's too many other big hits.<br /><br />All things considered, this is a pretty well put together compilation, especially for only being one disc.  It's too bad that Nickelback's list of singles seems to be saturated with ballads, but I guess that's what got them where they are.  Maybe less people would be so harsh on them if they were exposed to the side of Nickelback that rocks out.  Check out songs like Burn It To The Ground, Because Of You, Side Of A Bullet, This Means War, and Animals.  Well, this should make a nice holiday gift if you know someone who loves all those radio hits and wants to have them in one place!  Here's looking forward to Volume 2!'s missing?

B008JFUO72|5.0|This was my all time favorite movie of the year and by far my favorite Iron Man movie so far.  We have seen Tony go from playboy jerk billionaire to Super Hero Invincible Iron Man to simply being a hard working and brilliant human being in three amazing movies.  After the Avengers kicked serious super aliens out of New York City, Tony returns home to settle down with Pepper and live a nice, quiet life... until panic attacks, obsessive behaviors, and fears threaten to overwhelm him. Tony creates a plethora of Iron Man suits (all of which we get to see in the amazing final ending).  A terrorist/super villain/madman threatens the world/the US President/Tony/Iron Patriot (aka War Machine).  His best buddy Happy (remember his now obsolete 'security guard'?) nearly dies, his house is destroyed, Jarvis nearly 'dies', Tony nearly dies, Pepper nearly dies, well...you get the picture.  Tony becomes a human again.  A real human of flesh and blood.  And as he puts it in the end &#34;I AM IRON MAN&#34;  A definite 5 star movie for me...  I am so shocked that the third movie was by FAR my favorite of the three!  If you were sick of Tony's self-centered egotistical womanizing and partying behaviors in the first movie, there is light at the end of the tunnel as Tony finally figures out what is really important in life.

B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|Let me start by saying that I was a big fan of Alice In Chains' last album, &#34;Black Gives Way To Blue.&#34;  It was their first album without the amazing Layne Staley, and even though I was unsure of them continuing to use the same band name, I was glad that the other 3 members were working together again and I was thoroughly satisfied with the results.  I mention that because I don't want you to think I'm immediately denying this album any stars simply because Layne isn't singing on it.  This album doesn't stray far from the familiar AIC sound, in fact it's still very much the same kind of thing they were doing back in 2009.  I loved BGWTB, it was my favorite album of that year!  So why was I so unimpressed with this?  It's hard to say, but I think the main reason is that I just didn't find most of the songs to be all that interesting.  &#34;Hollow&#34; was the first track that I heard, and while it does all the things the band is known for, there's not a real memorable hook that really gets you locked in.  &#34;Pretty Done&#34; has a cool, haunting melody but it just sort of repeats over and over.  &#34;Stone&#34; is more of the same.  By the time we get to &#34;Voices,&#34; it's a welcome breath of fresh air simply for being acoustic.  I like this song, but I don't love it, which is pretty much how I feel about the album overall.  The rest of the songs are the same sludgy grooves that the album started out with.  Don't get me wrong, AIC is great at that kind of thing (&#34;Grind,&#34; &#34;Sludge Factory&#34;) but despite repeated listenings I didn't find anything memorable about most of these songs.  I noticed that the newest member, William DuVall, isn't really the band's new singer.  He's really a backup singer/guitarist while Jerry Cantrell has taken on lead vocals and guitar.  This is good because it still sounds similar to the classic AIC songs, but it lacks the variety that having both Jerry AND Layne brought to the table.  William still has his own moments on here but they seem few and far between.  Also, I rarely ever complain about this sort of thing, but this album seems to drag a bit.  It's only 12 songs but the total running time is almost 70 minutes, which seems even longer without any songs that punch you in the face with awesomeness.  I'm not even comparing this album to classic AIC albums like &#34;Dirt,&#34; but this didn't even seem to pack the same kinda bunch as their last album.  There's nothing on here as good as &#34;Check My Brain,&#34; &#34;Your Decision,&#34; or &#34;Private Hell.&#34;  It's still AIC, so I enjoy some of it, but the album as a whole just seems underwhelming.  Maybe it'll grow on me more over time, I don't know.ents on here but they seem few and far between.  Also, I rarely ever complain about this sort of thing, but this album seems to drag a bit.

B003B02OOG|4.0|i bought this one since I had read all of John Grisham's novels (except the baseball themed books--which didn't sound like thrillers) and was looking to read some more until the next novel came out.  I normally don't like short stories much.  My reasoning is that if I really like the story line and start to like the characters, I tend to get bummed out when the story ends abruptly after what seems like a short introduction.  This one has mostly really good stories.  I think part of the reason I didn't mind the short approach with these characters lies in the general nature of most of Grisham's characters.  They are almost all dysfunctional--some a little and many wildly so.  It makes for great entertainment, but I don;t fall in love with most of them easily--even most of the heros.  They are quirky and full of strange ideals, but the author paints them so well that you just can't help but get sucked into their stories.  I would say this book is high on the list of books available from John Grisham (the top being classics like The Firm, The Pelican brief and the worst being The Painted House--no mystery at all but a strained study in metaphors).  Some of the stories in this one are worth reading again after the details get a little foggy with time.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|very slow response when touching the numbers.  also with ads.  the ads could be what slows it down but the only way to get rid of them is to purchase the ap.  if I wanted to pay for it I would just buy a normal calculator.

B00GH4R95C|4.0|Though too much emphasis was placed on special effects, I liked the quicker way Superman was shown to fly. The way he killed General Zor though was questionable: if both men are invulnerable on planet Earth how can Superman break his neck and kill him? The overall story was compelling. The happy ending with Superman as Clark Kent joining The Daily Planet was fitting.

B00571F26Y|4.0|Well, a gluten free diet appeals to me. The book seems well researched and after two weeks on no gluten, not sure if I note any difference. But I do agree less wheat is better for you. The even make gluten free beer now. I do not consider this a diet book. It is more of a lifestyle change. Like going veggie.
0930289234|5.0|this reprint is not as high quality as the original series, but the story is timeless. I still love it as much as I did when I had to wait for the next installment. I love to study all the little brilliant details of the gorgeously drawn frames and the text is a compelling page turner. I love to have it around because soon my kids will start reading it, and I rather they have this copy to spill their cokes on than my original prints.

B00G32OMF8|1.0|The entire &#34;Before&#34; series is very polarizing.  You either love the movies or hate them (e.g.  at the time of this review there were 35 five-star reviews and 21 one-star reviews).  If you enjoy hearing the conversations of two lovers for long periods of time, you'll love these movies.  For some, seeing the flirtation, deep thoughts,  and up/downs between the lovers can be entertaining.  There aren't many side stories (if any) in these movies.  There aren't many characters (usually only two).  There are scenes where dialogue happens continuously for what seems like 20 minutes.<br /><br />I didn't want to watch &#34;Before Midnight&#34;, having seen the first movie.  However, my wife enjoyed the first two movies and I watched to support her.  This movie had some new characters and the relationship between the two main characters has evolved significantly since the first movie.  Some of the scenery in the movie was beautiful.<br /><br />Despite my low rating, I know many people love these movies and I totally respect that.  Although these movies weren't for me, that doesn't mean they suck.  I admire them for being different and showing how a relationship evolves over time.
0810993139|4.0|I have read every Wimpy Kid, and this is the 3rd-to-worst book of the series. The book is great, but compared to the others, it fails in comparison. I'm an 11 year old who loves reading, and I have read many great books, 39 Clues, School of Fear, Goosebumps, A Series of Unfortunate Events, and so on. Diary of a Wimpy Kid ranks 3, preceded by School of Fear. Looking back at it, this book is boring, but laughable.<br /><br /> Gregory Heffely is a wimpy kid stuck in middle school. He has a half-friend named Rowley Jefferson. Greg knows that he will be a big-shot one day, but you can't really prove yourself as a C student who gets in trouble. He's always trying wacky ideas that he thinks will boost his popularity level, and impress his crush: Holly Hills. Explore Greg's thoughts on everything, from video games to Mrs. Norton.<br /><br />If you love Diary of a Wimpy Kid, try out Big Nate.
B00AB2DNBU|5.0|All I can say is this is my favorite edition of this classic film to date, and there have been dozens. But this SteelBook has plenty of extras for the Evil Dead fan. And hey its the Evil Dead!
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|Fantastic wireless headset.  I read someone's review saying that it's too light....  That's the entire point.  It's not supposed to weigh you head down, it's supposed to be comfortable, and it is.
B00ESF285S|5.0|Love this book! Special for graduates!! Can't beat Dr Seuss!! I love this for graduates - it is a fun gift with some wise quotes!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I have played games that kick me off all the time. This is the first game to not kick me off.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Brand new. Has a longer a wire than regular US Gamecube controllers, and the sleek white color makes it awesomer
B00ESNE696|5.0|Its a compelling storyline, the acting is excellent and it is interesting in that something new is always happening to surprise you.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am just starting to understand and use the game so I don't want to give it the full 5 star rating.  It is fun and it is confusing at the same time and it is also mind boggling.  I do enjoy it though.  I tend to lose lives real quick though.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|Interesting, but very difficult to keep up with the characters and story line. I regularly read fantasy fiction, but this was alittle out there.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Good season 2. Can be watched as separate stories. No too much of smooching girly stuff. Highly recommend to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Christian and Ana both from opposite economic, familial, and sexual orientations become aroused by what the other has to offer. No limits to the magnetism evolving relationship. Leaves you feeling aroused to keep reading more.
