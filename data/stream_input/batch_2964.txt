B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a Great game to play with the family and pass the time. Strategic yet it comes down to luck!
0307277453|5.0|Fascinating new information, well written, interesting facts on every page along with a sense of humor make this a must read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The best bingo game I have found that I can sit and play all day long .Love the pics and the fee bingo  chips.keys and everything else it gives
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've done a lot of research and have a lot of friends who are olympic weight lifting coaches - Michael's book has some of the best information in it which agrees with them all, and goes into more depth.  Michael has great results to show, but he is also a down to earth person who maintains contact with his readers. An all around knowledgeable and friendly guy, and Bigger Leaner Stronger is his masterpiece. I would recommend this book and his others to any one new or experienced in body building, weight lifting or weight loss.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has everything u would ever want!  I play it all the time!!!!!!!! And plus its free! A free game and its awesome!!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It was an exellent experience very entertaining as well as good graphics the system worked well all in all amazon did a good job with their instant video options.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like it a lot. Me and my grandmother both have it. We LOVE it. She plays mine and I play hers, but I think you should not have the winning game cause it ruins the fun! #ilovegames
B0074YVW1G|4.0|I have had to learn (the long, hard way) how to function in a work area 'dominated' by extroverts. I just wish I'd read this book 15 years ago. BZ.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|My husband and daughter are sci-fi fanatics which I how I was convinced to watch Thor. The end of the movie made more sense to me than the beginning set up. Just not my style.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|The second season takes you on a ride into this hectic world of Walter White and his transformation.  Great story line!!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Though some crude humor, the show is witty and entertaining. I like that the show is always bringing the unexpected.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|You had great people and a great story but it could not even compare to the original and the changes did not work
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is awesome!!!!!!! it is so much fun... I love playing it... best game ever... I play it all day sometimes
B003M70O5O|5.0|Love the action and drama.  I really feel like I know these characters and have learned to love and hate them.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved it. It was a GREAT book, with lots of action. I have recomended the Percy Jackson series's to almost everyone I know. If you have not read this book, READ IT.<br />The plot to this book is so perfect. This book provides action, friendship, and lots, LOTS more. If you are a Percabeth kinda person, you're not gonna want to miss out. There's tons of thrilling parts with original characters in dangerous situations. Annabeth's got a dangerous mission on her hands, Percy and Jason have the Roman Camp too avoid, and Hazel's got a little brother to save. With all that action, there's bound to be an interesting part meant for you.<br />Overall, this book is GREAT. If you're a fan of the seven, or the seven plus one (Percy, Annabeth, Hazel, Frank, Leo, Piper, and Jason, plus a personal fave, Nico di Angelo), then you're bound to go head over heels for this increadable book.<br />Cannot wait for the House of Hades!!! :)
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I am an average gamer and mostly casual user as a college student. For my first computer build, this CPU was the perfect choice. I can do whatever I want to with this, and with 1866 8GB RAM it has run flawlessly. No games I have played (Warcraft 3, LoL, Counter Strike, Bioshock) have given me a spick of an issue. I am also running dual monitors. Wait for a sale and buy this thing!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I am also reading, at the same time, Rescuing Ambition.  The books seem to be in conflict with one another but I really do appreciate the encouragement that Sheryl brings to women.  I  vacillate between being ambitious and leaning in while trying to accomplish a purpose and live as a Christian in the workplace.  I am not done with either book, but I do recommend this book as an informed perspective on the workplace but it should be balanced by other view points.
B001TM14VC|5.0|This is a good movie with pieces of humor,aerial action at a fast pace you'll love it.  Idid. Tom Cruise is great
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|It was OK but no real connection to the characters. The story line was good but I feel I needed more knowledge of who the characters are within.  I don't like an extremely detailed book but not enough in this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is the best book I read in quite awhile. Extremely well-written. This story is unusual with very unexpected plot developments and interesting characters.  I couldn't put it down.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very well written. Although the beginning seemed a bit disjointed, it soon became clear that all the families would have a common bond. You begin to feel for every single character & realize when a tragedy strikes, it impacts more people than imaginable. You examine your own character as how you might handle such circumstances.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|I was disappointed in this app, but honestly playing movie media on my phone has been a PITA. I have a Google Nexus S phone so it is/was widely used and a &#34;smartphone&#34;.<br /><br />I downloaded the app and tested probably 5-6 videos in wmp, mp4, avi, The best I got was video and no audio. The files work fine on my pc so is likely some issue with a codes or something. Either way I couldnt get anything to play with both audio and video.<br /><br />In consolation I did try on 3 other media players and got similar results, so I cannot conclude entirely that this app is crap.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|We all know what happens, just not how. We all know they are real people fighting to protect their country & all of us. Looking them up to put a face to a name was both the best & worst decision. It made it all too real. Great book if you like memoirs, history, war stories. Warning: horrible book if you are sensitive- chapter 8 will hit you hard & it doesn't let up
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This was a great album. I was very pleased. It's the same style as their last one so if you liked that you will like this.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I liked reading about the evolution of wheat and how modified it is nowadays.  I have a friend who lost 60 pounds from excluding wheat from her diet.  I tried the diet too but lost nothing. Then I took a food allergy test that showed that I wasn't even mildly allergic to wheat but was sensitive to whey and eggs.  Dr. Davis suggests eating as much cheese and eggs as you want without even warning you that you could be allergic to these things.  He seems to believe that almost everyone is allergic or sensitive to wheat and that wheat alone is the main culprit behind the problem of obesity in our country.  Obviously, in my case, this is not true.  Still, it was good to get educated about food and health even though little of it pertained to me personally.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This real music. Justin Timberlake is awesome. His musically ability is greater than a lot if the newer artist out. I can't wait for part 2 to come out
B006O5Y75Y|5.0|Excellent quality image. I liked to see this movie. May I'll repeat this movie. I recommend this movie. Thank you.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I can't wait for season three to become available on Prime. My entire family is addicted. We now watch real time on USA Network
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|UPDATE-<br /><br />Decided to update my impression of the figure now that i'm over my excitement i saw some flaws =/ the paint on her left boot had no smear but it was like they added a little too much white over the white causing it to look like an over painted finger nail but it didn't go past the area where it needed to be painted but it did look like a little too much was added, also I saw a very tiny and almost unnoticeable paint chip on her left pigtail .-. now that i see it.. I can't stop knowing it's there >.&lt; it's so small yet annoying like a tiny spec of gray dust you can't remove T-T.. The figure overall is great but quality was lacking =/ so upset that I now see these flaws :I it'll be hard for most of us to sell them in these conditions especially in the future .-., If you're buying it please be careful with them because honestly if your like me you'll flip over things being ehhhhh even if it's so tiny X.x<br /><br />OLD-<br /><br />I loved this and so did my cousin when she saw it with me ^-^ I can't tell you how happy I am to own this figure :3 it came perfect with no missing pieces, no paint mistakes, no loose or falling off pieces :D it sticks all right and hasn't fallen apart :P I'm so happy with it and I can't tell you how pleased I am that it came safely =) guess amazon heard the complaints and took precaution with future figures :D
B002POMLHY|5.0|one of the best breaking benjamin albums, composed very well. The heavy guitar brings breaking benjamin back into the rock scene
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This Angry Birds game is the best game we have so far (better than Angry Birds Space, Bad Piggies, Star Wars, Seasons, and Golden Egg Guide) except that there<br /><br />is only 2 sessions (with 2 parts each: Join the Pork Side and the birds' team) and a reward chapter (for getting this many points with this character, this<br /><br />many with that) and a coming soon session. I (and my brother) am (are) going to do Join the Pork side tonight, so I CAN'T WAIT!!!!! And if you're concerned<br /><br /> with in-app purchases, then just tell the one playing that they may only buy one permanent bird of their choice (permanent means there is no limit on how many<br /><br />they use) and one permanent pig. Plus you can get some \\"sling credits\\" for free for completing 5 levels, completing 25, getting this many points, etc. so you<br /><br />get some money off!!!!<br /><br />Why are you looking at this review???...BUY THE APP NOW AND PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />P.S. This will be the best game yet once the coming soon session comes out!!! :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was completely amazing, even if it did make me think about my mortality and cry. Absolutely, amazingly, beautifully incredible.
B00403CLKK|5.0|I looked up her music when I saw her on Dancing with the Stars. I have watched this dvd 5 or 6 times and I love it more every time. the best part is the song \\"The angel\\". it makes me cry, it is so beautiful. what a gorgeous voice and a gorgeous woman.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|a must have for any Ariana Grande fan<br />her debut album is an excellent start<br /><br />music flows very well and has a great easy listening quality to it,<br />only one song doesn't fit in my opinion, (Popular Song), but is still a song to listen to nonetheless
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a great time playing. Wish there were more levels. The game was challenging enough to keep you playing. But not too  hard to make you give up. The floors were at the right skill level.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love despicable me: minion rush because you get to go to different places and you can get different costumes
B005MLOKXA|5.0|After each session I was eager for the next.  The story line was strong, the characters well developed and the acting great.  An excellent series and I look for more like this.
B008N1V11U|1.0|When I go into the app. It says user not owned or some non sense like that. Ok recommend that you do not waste your money on this garbage.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Another gripping, hard to put down Reacher yarn. Excellent as usual - exactly as expected, Reacher fans won't be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|:)<br />It's super fun and there's lots of things to do in the game; I just wish everything didn't cost so many coins.  But that's how they make money!
055358202X|3.0|After completing this book I've now read enough descriptions of - and activities with - nipples to last a lifetime. That goes for awkward descriptions of female sexuality, too.<br /><br />Reading this book is like playing one of those old PC adventure games. Walk up to random character, random character shares a bunch of useless information. Move on to next townsfolk (or should I say smallfolk in their smallclothes). More useless info to skim over.<br /><br />The book is fine. It is part of a seven-part series, so I don't expect it to cover all the bases. Looking forward to the next one, but I'm not going to set my expectations too high.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Easy to see the tiles and easy to maneuver. Puzzles are challenging. I would like to see the number of shuffles reduced to just one or two.
0812550706|5.0|This was a gift to somebody else who requested it.  The person said he liked it and that anything by this author is good.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I love this CD!!!  I'm planning on replacing my lost cd's due to recent divorce.  Pink Floyd is the way to go on a rainy afternoon...
140006922X|5.0|I love this book.  All kinds of historical information about the time of Jesus Christ....things one cannot get from the New Testament.  Mr. Aslan hit the nail on the head!  Easy to read and very interesting.  Haven't quite finished it yet but expect to be done this weekend!
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|JUST loaded this app very easy to use and find video without a hard search. The play back is fast I enjoy it with my Kindle fire HD. Thanks
0143038095|4.0|I actually saw the movie before I read the book.  This doesn't happen very often but I liked the movie better than I liked the book.  I would recommend it though...Amy Tan is a wonderful novelist.
B0037A4ILC|3.0|This was an interesting film about the ascent of Mt. Eiger by two mountain climbing teams: The Austrians and Germans. Both care more about the ascent than about politics that take place just before the full onslaught of World War II.<br />Overall, it was okay and nothing special.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|I have loved this movie when I frist saw it, but I am one of Cary Grant's BBIGGEST FANS!!!! Anything he's in I either have it or will soon get it! I have loved him since I was a kid! Anything with him in it I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The story is a terrible, horrible plight for Jun Do or anyone else living there.  The horrors and the despair and the innate fear is all spelled out in this book but there was also some twisted humor - the Texas trip, the propaganda, the Dear Leader's infatuation with the Rower.  Extraordinary read, I  know why it got a Pulitzer, couldn't put it down, highly recommended.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I love it. I had to get it and watch it again. Can't wait til his second one comes out!
B00005B1W5|5.0|Saw bits and pieces of this video on the local PBS station years ago.  I've always liked the music of Yanni so I just figured I'd like this video, and I was right.  Great Stuff!!  Even better locations!!
B005PK1G76|5.0|Save your money and buy this stroller organizer! It is just as nice and functional as the Britax, only a ton cheaper!
B000002KXV|5.0|I love this album...every song on it is a winner.  The man is a genius with his lyrics and music.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I understand that Disney is a strictly for profit company.  I was neither surprised nor dismayed by the coercive tactics employed to garner purchases.  I was, however, repulsed by the intentional programming designed to cheat players.  The fact that the treasure chests and special seeds rip players off more often than not strikes me as sick and twisted - especially since this is supposed to be a game for children.  Disney has sunk exceedingly low, imo.
B0091W4PRC|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever saw.  So refreshing to see a movie without all the violence, sex and filthy language.  Actors did a superb job.
B000SX9IXO|5.0|The anxious vocals belie the complex tapestry of instruments, just as the lyrics (apparently about the &#34;old days&#34; but really about the 60s) echo the worries that lay just beneath the surface of Woodstock and the Summer of Love, and which showed up as the Tate murders and Altamont.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I don't receive gifts from friends.and I can't join them when there online.I'm going to remove this app from device.I have complained 4 times about these problems no reply or a way to fix's it. not a happy customer.I am on level 30 so it is a disappointment that it was not solved.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Very compelling.  Kept our interest. Different spin on a zombie movie. Many surprises you were not expecting  Not my usual type of movie
B00ECUARO8|5.0|A combination mystery/drama, Mud wins your heart. Beyond the drama, it is an exploration of the relationships between fathers and sons. Well worth the watch.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I've had my 7506 SONYs for 13 years now. They're efficient (My ipod has enough power for them), comfortable, and they don't fatigue my ears. HOWEVER, if you're going to use the headphones for producing/mixing music or video  please be aware that these headphones are not neutral, THEY ARE BRIGHT - meaning they add a lot of high end (treble/presence) to everything and if you don't adjust your mix accordingly you'll end up with very dark mixes (not enough treble/highs).  You'll have to play your mixes on lots of different sets of speakers to make sure your mix sounds good (you should do this anyway) or compare the sound of your mix against other CDs through these headphones (if you're only using these headphones) to make sure your mix sounds as bright as the others.<br />  Don' let the brightness scare you though. You'll be spending a LOT more to get a set of (sufficiently powered) neutral \\"reference\\" headphones to mix with if you go another route.  Just be aware of the brightness. These are a bargain and they're a real industry standard for good reason (they aren't a mixing standard, however).<br />  Another issue some folks nitpick about is that over time the vinyl on the ear cups may disintegrate or flake off. This doesn't affect performance or comfort, but you can replace them or re-cover them if needed (mine show some wear but i've never noticed or been fussed about this).
1476727651|5.0|My wife is a Stephen King fanatic when it comes to a new novel. Twenty five years and I don't know<br />how many  books by this man I have purchased for her but she loves to read them and I admire anyone that loves to read.<br />Amazon has everything I can imagine online so I looked it up and to no surprise they had the book as it was just released.<br />Thank you Amazon I may be your number 1 fan!<br />  Ron Lingerfelt
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is so cool. I never get bored reading this book that is how cool it is I love it and you would to
B0036FYO12|5.0|Enjoyed it when it first came out; enjoyed it just as much today. Dated with the technology but a great suspense triller.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|Good advice on streamlining your purpose.  I would recommend this book to nonprofits as well. Wish there had been more nonprofits represented
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Smart, suspenseful with just the right blend of human drama. Chris Nothing is always fun to watch and Juliana Margulies is understated in her role, which is always refreshing. Terrific cast!
B00C5R8364|4.0|Very hard to put down. Appears to be plausible  makes me want to sample other books by the same author
0823015017|5.0|This book has good techniques and are easy to fallow the instructions. I like the the color she use in her projects.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|easy to use and easy to navigate. no information on how score is achieved. only reviewing because it nags to do so. if that continues after this review I will edit and dock stars.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Best superhero movie of 2013, Robert Downey Jr. at his best, animation never this well done, action and suspense, what else could you expect from the Iron Man?
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|the show moves quickly, and the characters are quirky enough to keep your interest.  If you enjoy a lawyer show that moves along...it is a good one.
B009M7G1PU|5.0|50 Shades is pale compared to this. The language is naughty. I was sure what Lawrence's idea of off color would've been a bit more innocent, but NO. The situation including the 1/10th of 1% vs the 99% and surviving marriage (or not) within that system seem timeless. Loved it. Hope they live happily ever after.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great DVD Jack the Giant Slayer, it was great and great quality.  This also was a gift and received it on time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this free version!!! Nice options. Ads are not too intrusive. Tried other free versions and this is the best.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|love the show. spent the weekend watching an AHS seasons 1 and 2 marathon. my husband swears they are going to connect the three seasons together somehow. I don't know how that is possible but would be a nice twist
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|First rate acting by all. Great story lines and characters with lots of twist.  I would recommend this show to those who enjoy quality tv.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I have only had this alarm app for a short time but it has already become the best ala I have ever had and it is a very useful clock.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Brilliant, smart, great acting, intrigue and really interesting choices in music and camera work.  I am still enjoying this no formula/ formula show.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|Now don't get me wrong the game's great for kindle users, especially kids. But after playing it for a while myself, I found it got old pretty quick. My kids find it great and funny so if you have kids I would say get this for them. It is worth the dollar you pay for it.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|You will enjoy this series if you watch it for fun and not for \\"historical accuracy.\\"  After all, this was a series on Showtime, not PBS or something.  I watch it as if it was just any \\"fictional\\" period drama.  I watched this on amazon prime streaming so I can't comment on disc quality.<br />I only wish Natalie Dormer WASN'T cast as the role of Anne Boleyn.  She played a major role in the first two seasons...good acting but...her face and facial expressions are annoying and incredibly irritating...especially that duck pursed lip she makes.  Irritating esp if you're watching this in marathon.  I had to skip several episodes to the part where they finally chopped Boleyn's head off.<br />But thank god for Henry Cavill as Charles Brandon!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|In my review of this book it was okay but the other two were the best. This one was a little rushed and a little less detailed than the others. Otherwise it was pretty good at the end. This is to Suzanne Collins you should write the epilogue and make it a book about Katniss's and Peeta's kids. That would be an interesting book have them some how bring back the games or make a new kind of game
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I love the X-Men series, and  Hugh jackman is an amazing actor. I have started collecting all of the X-men series, and I only have one more to go.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game because you can make the city of your dreams. The only problem in this game is the energy.
B003WE9TU8|2.0|The book starts of with a bang. From this point onwards it starts to go down hill as if on a slide in playground. The further you go into the book it becomes more of the same with a different scene with the same story. I thought it would improve; but it did not.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|most realistic animals, and I can play it with my great-grandchildren. Family friendly, it is also easy to understand. I'm a newby at computers so need easy. It keeps my ggkids  interest as well as my own so hits a gambit of age groups.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This one gets you thinking.  It's rewarding to finally<br />figure out all the clues. I Cant think of any improvements
1608199096|5.0|Scrumptious recipes that stay true to the heart of Italian regional cuisine.  QUALITY of ingredients crucial.  Finished recipes on resplendent display.  Deliciously delightful!  Rarely, in recent memory have I found a Rabbit recipe that harkens to my childhood.<br />Thank You.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Ok this game is absolutely awesome BUT I got this for free since I have been waiting for this game to be free because the developers of World of Goo has done this countless of times.  Several of my friends have World of Goo thanks to the game being free out of the blue. So if I were you, just be patience and wait for the developers to announce that this game is free someday. You should google their twitter page and follow their twitter because I am sure they will advertise whenever world of goo is free again in the future.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy the game. It is addictive. So far it has been nothing but straight hidden items games but with 2 block games. It would be so much better if there were many more puzzle games or being able to move through the pictures to other rooms like a lot of the other games. I also enjoy when thy speak the storyline instead of just having to read them. Other than that its an ok games.
B0061S0A64|5.0|got this gem for free and its pretty awesome! I would wait for this game to be free again before you download it, so if this cost money then just wait! I am sure it will be free again soon.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far it's a pretty fun game. I like the puzzles they have on there. I wish would give you what you need to banish stuff
B00846WWVM|4.0|Well its a fun and cute game! But is it worth buying? Probably not because there are millions of other games that are free but I got this for free, so if i were you, i would just wait for this game to be free again!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman writes incredible modern fables.  This one made me think about identity and reality...  who we think we are and what we think we know of the real world.  Is there a price paid on behalf of each of our lives?  And are we worthy of it?
B004TTZHBK|1.0|I was forced to choose the 1 star because the reviews section does not allow users to choose ZERO stars because that is the honest truth about this app since this app does not deserve even 1 star but zero stars instead!<br /><br />The reason why I downloaded this app was because it was free. I have a message board bookmarked that I check everyday and this message board is a place for people to post information about free stuff such as free apps or whatever that is free. So after I saw that this Jamie's 20 Minute Meals was free instead of the overpriced $7-$8 because the free app offer was only for 18 hours I think. Anyways, I am glad I downloaded this because now I can write a review about how poorly overpriced and broken this app truly is.<br /><br />First: every single \\"20 minute\\" meal that is available in this app can be found online for FREE! I was truly hoping there would be some exclusive recipes that cannot be found online but I was wrong and I don't think others will noticed that since they may not even google the recipe.<br /><br />Second: this app is broken on quite a few devices. I tried to see if this would work on the newest and oldest kindle fire and it does NOT work. It just keeps freezing or locking up which forces me to hold down the power button to wait 30 seconds to finally turn off before powering it back on again. I finally got it to work on my cell phone that is two years old but it doesn't work on the newest kindle fire? Whomever did the quality assurance testing on this app clearly didn't do their job.<br /><br />Third: I used to be a quality assurance tester for several products such as apps and video games for 4 plus years but I retired from that job a few years ago and I have to say that this app was NOT tested. Whichever company that was in charge of this app did NOT hire a few quality assurance testers to test this app on multiple devices and most of all to make sure it works properly. I found at least 6 bugs/glitches that were VERY easily to do again and did not require more than 2 steps to reproduce the issue again, I don't want to spend the next 5 minutes explaining all the glitches/bugs I have found because it's just not worth my time due to this poorly made app.<br /><br />Fourth: The price of this app is absolutely a total scam since this app is advertised to work on many devices and the app also claimed to have exclusive recipes but that is all a bunch of PR marketing lies just to convince casual audience to buy this app without realizing that they are about to regret this purchased. There are THOUSANDS of other FREE apps that offer hundreds of thousands of amazing recipes, you are MUCH better off by downloading the free apps that have more recipes than this ridiculous $7-$8 app.<br /><br />I really wish I could type down some of the positive things that I found from this app but I am honestly telling you that there isn't one good thing about this app that is worth the $7-$8 and I know this from experience since I have downloaded over 100+ apps. Over 50 of them were priced between 99 cents up to $9.99 BUT I got them for free because whenever a new app is released, the company behind the app will allow the app to be free for one day either a few weeks after the release or several months later because it is a good way to get people to spread the word about the app they just downloaded for free because the people they tell to download the app will end up having to pay for it cause the free offer will expire within 12-24 hours, depending on the company. The rest of the 50 apps I got were free 100% and never charged at all.<br /><br />Do please do yourself a favor and SKIP this app because you are MUCH better off keeping the $7-$8 bucks.  As a matter of fact, you can use that money to buy seven or eight 99 cents app that offer WAY more than this poorly broken scam app.ly to do again and did not require more than 2 steps to reproduce the issue again, I don't want to spend the next 5 minutes explaining all the glitches/bugs I have found because it's just not worth my time due to this poorly made app.<br /><br />Fourth: The price of this app is absolutely a total scam since this app is advertised to work on many devices and the app also claimed to have exclusive recipes but that is all a bunch of PR marketing lies just to convince casual audience to buy this app without realizing that they are about to regret this purchased. There are THOUSANDS of other FREE apps that offer hundreds of thousands of amazing recipes, you are MUCH better off by downloading the free apps that have more recipes than this ridiculous $7-$8 app.<br /><br />I really wish I could type down some of the positive things that I found from this app but I am honestly telling you that there isn't one good thing about this app that is worth the $7-$8 and I know this from experience since I have downloaded over 100+ apps. Over 50 of them were priced between 99 cents up to $9.99 BUT I got them for free because whenever a new app is released, the company behind the app will allow the app to be free for one day either a few weeks after the release or several months later because it is a good way to get people to spread the word about the app they just downloaded for free because the people they tell to download the app will end up having to pay for it cause the free offer will expire within 12-24 hours, depending on the company. The rest of the 50 apps I got were free 100% and never charged at all.<br /><br />Do please do yourself a favor and SKIP this app because you are MUCH better off keeping the $7-$8 bucks.  As a matter of fact, you can use that money to buy seven or eight 99 cents app that offer WAY more than this poorly broken scam app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is my most favorite program, and I am not usually a tv program lover.  I cannot get enough of watching this.  The time period, costuming, set design and everything is all very interesting to me and of course, all of the actors superb.  I cannot wait for season 4.
B00AEBB9CS|5.0|If you are looking for that ULTIMATE milkshake to satisfy your life, then you must absolutely buy this! If you are one of those people that buys milkshakes at mcdonalds or some other garbage fast food place, then you need to be put in a basket and sold off at some auction marketplace. Now keep in mind, some may say that the 5 dollar Milkshake that John Travolta had in the 90s was better but that was a LONG time ago and right now there is a MUCH BETTER milkshake.  Please do yourself a favor and buy this milkshake ASAP. I promise you will be talking about this milkshake for DECADES and you will be telling your kids about the best milkshake you have ever had. So what are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this? BUY THIS MILKSHAKE AND DRINK IT UP!
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|The sound track was really bad. It was way to load during the various demolition scenes and to low during speaking scenes IF you you didn't try adjusting sound.<br />It was a fair story and I enjoyed the the live actors.
B004SKHJF2|2.0|its not too bad, at least its free but I stopped using this because Spotify is the way to go these days. So instead of downloading this Shazam, do yourself a favor and just download Spotify.
0446556750|5.0|Connelly teaches about court and legal procedure as he takes us on an absorbing ride. In this novel the two half brothers, Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller, are brought together in a gingerly way, as are their daughters, promising a closer relationship in future books. I hope that will be true.  I must have missed the first books that showed how Mickey Haller separated from two wives, or perhaps those situations were fait accompli from the beginning.  It is amusing that both ex-wives remain in his life, and the second, Lorna, even works for him.  The trial of Jason Jessup, the ex-con up for retrial, is a compendium of politics, strategy, and suspense.  Kudos to Connelly for a riveting tale.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|got it for free, used it for 4 mins, never used it again lol the only reason why i downloaded this in the first place was because it was free at the time.
B00D7OMNXS|3.0|Got the blu-ray and as with many recent films like Pacific Rim the advancements in CGI continue to amaze, things are nice and gritty in their realism matched nicely by the picture quality of the blu-ray. Robert Downey Jr. shines again as the snarky Tony Stark suffering from a form of PTSD after the events of the Avengers. He butts heads w/ the Mandarin, a sort of OBL shadowy terrorist.  The intro of A.I.M from the Marvel universe was also an interesting touch.  That said I've thought the Iron Man series has been kind of uneven; maybe due to no-one being able to effectively compete for screen time with Downey Jr. So the plots often come across as empty w/ no real conflict or character development.  Ah well, I do wish I would have picked it up for nearer $11 like the other ones dropped to than a full price new release.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Nothing out there is quite as spectacular as this Planet Earth series.  I teach 4th grade and we watch an episode in my class every once in a while and my students just LOVE it! It allows us to experience parts of our amazing world we wouldn't be able to see without this series.  It also will get you thinking about how what humans do everyday without thinking twice about it affects our world and the other species that live in it! Definitely worth the time and money!
B009HEMW4W|3.0|Not quite the show I had hoped for, like the cast had lost their &#34;zing&#34;, for lack of a better term.

1451695195|4.0|A neurosurgeon undergoes a unique NDE because of a very rare condition: the premise of all this are pretty good and results in the most unusual NDE I've heard of (for better or worse).<br /><br />The writing is good and the various subjects are tackled with maturity. Religion, science, etc, everything is dealt with in intelligent ways. The author doesn't force extremes and it all seems fairly honest and genuine.<br /><br />There have been some attacks on how Alexander lied about his condition, how he said his brain was utterly off during the coma and how that wasn't true. Well, in the book itself, he explains very clearly that his neocortex was out but he never says his entire brain was out. He's a neurosurgeon, he knows a bit about the brain and he explains it very well in the book. So there is no controversy there. (In short, you can't have hallucinations or any consciousness if your neocortex is out and only your \\"primal\\" brain is functional.)<br /><br />I confess the book didn't have the effect on me that Life After Life had, a long time ago, but that's probably for two reasons: first, it's only one testimony; second, it's so unusual. Granted, Alexander \\"died harder\\" than others who may only have approached the afterlife, but still. Alexander underwent almost none of the usual NDE phases: out of body experience, life review, etc. Granted again, his entire experience seems to be placed past all of these, as he had no memory of having been on earth at all during these experiences.<br /><br />So what's beyond mortal life? Well, basically three realms: one that isn't nice at all, one that is much nicer, and the Core. The first is like being a worm in the dirt with lots of organic entities going around; the second is close to what we imagine to be Heaven, and the third is a heart of darkness that is love. I have never heard of God/Love being described as darkness, so that's quite a first there.<br /><br />What of the title, though? Is there proof of Heaven in this book? Yes. But I'm afraid it's only proof to the author himself, as we can only take his word for it. He makes a point to differentiate his experiences (\\"ultra real\\") from his slight dementia after coming back from the coma and explains how different these are. I'll gladly believe him, but that's as far as it goes when it comes to proof.<br /><br />It's always frustrating to hear that someone met God and comes back with so little to say about it. I understand the sheer impossibility of the task - \\"words fail me, nothing can describe this, etc\\" - but one is left wanting.<br /><br />There are some pages devoted to Alexander's personal life and his relationship to feeling loved in the universe, based on the discovery that his natural parents gave him up for adoption and later rejected his request to meet them. It's rather touching and does not intrude on the rest of the book, although it may make some readers feel that his experience is some sort of induced wishful thinking and whatnot. On the other hand, it may very well be a wound that helps highlight the truth. Be that as it may, Proof of Heaven is a good book and its potential shortcomings are perhaps only due to the author's honesty. What do I mean?<br /><br />What I mean is that the book is short and focused. I've read others with the same claim, and 90% of them were full of unrelated material and even more Ned Flanderism when it came to religion, which I found highly displeasing even though I'm definitely not against Christianity. Alexander doesn't speak all that much about meeting God because he knows anything he may write about the encounter will miss the mark, so he does what he can, and, arguably, it isn't much, but at least he doesn't try to bloat it up for convenience's sake.<br /><br />I understand that \\"Glimpse of Heaven\\" wasn't as attractive a title than the current title, but this would be more accurate. I'd recommend this book if you're into NDE's, of course, and if you're ready for a little bit of frustration. That said, I can only hope Mr. Alexander will continue his work in the NDE research as he has a privileged position that few, if anyone, have.

B00FEHXCIG|5.0|All three are awsome and can be watched over and over again and still never a dull moment. Simply a masterful piece of ongoing work.  I'm so happy to have been so fortunate to have met Mr. Robert Downey Jr. after he had played Chaplin. In addition to have the very best in the industry to be part of my lifetime.<br />George Santiago
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love this game. I played it on my friends iPod and it was very fun and humorous. The only thing is that you can't blow for the plane but in the settings on the game you can turn it off. Another thing is that it's a lot harder on the kindle than it is on the iPod, th  toaster one is really hard and so is the vomitting guy, also the toaster one is really touchy.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Effects were superb, some guys get all the fun. I love syfi flicks,  I urge you to enjoy this one too.

The Starch solution is well researched and scientifically documented that if Dr. Mcdougall is offered an hour of interview in prime time news television, he would save millions of lives, and Trillions of our healthcare costs.<br /><br />Read it and follow it for a 3 months and find out for yourself.

0345803493|5.0|The book was used but it was in very good condition.  This is a great bargain for the money !
B00E0SX118|4.0|The film is a very clever and funny look at family interactions but mainly looks at the father daughter relationship and her coming of age.  There are many inside jokes based on Cro-Magon/Neanderthal interactions with an upbeat take on the topic.  There is a sub plot regarding discovery and experimentation which works for me.  The animation is gorgeous
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Easy and fun game, and it's nice playing against live opponents. It can be tricky to get your shot perfect from time to time, and there is an occasional pause during game play, but nothing too bad.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really only bought this book based off a recommendation of a friend. I was whole-heartedly delighted after reading this book. It is a truly heart warming tale of love and tragedy.

B000I0XLYO|5.0|This is one of those stupidly funny movies. There is not a serious moment throughout the entire film. I think everyone should be able to laugh.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I purchased this book not knowing exactly what this book was about. Although at times I did enjoy it I found it very depressing.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I had fun reading this series. Starting with Uglies, I wasn't sure if I'd get into the storyline. Very extreme idea of people going from 'ugly' to 'pretty' via plastic surgeries that also apparently make you vapid and carefree. Certainly feels applicable to our society's obsession with appearance and celebrity lifestyle nowadays.<br /><br />Anyway - ended up not being able to put it down. Very fascinating to read about this 'world' that Scott Westerfeld has created. I couldn't wait to read Pretties. Definitely recommend as a fun, easy read.
B0093X805W|5.0|I think anyone can read it and end up loving it. It is quite joyful and exciting storyline.<br />- EMMA JONES
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This is a really fun and addictive game.  I like how they give you challenges and jobs for each kind of pirate.  This is a game that I play every day.
B002QBS9KE|4.0|I've had the Plantronics voyager bluetooth set for many years. I was happy that Amazon sold replacement ear buds without having to pay a lot of money.<br />I would highly suggest buying a replacement set for hygiene purposes.<br />Also, the gel piece on mine eventually tore around the base and made putting it on very difficult and un-comfortable.<br /><br />It is a very little price to extend the life of your bluetooth device.<br />OEM equipment. They are identical to what your Plantronics Voyager came with. Just make sure you are getting the right ear buds for your device!

Great depth throughout the entire video. exceptional color great effects. A movie you would not expect to be so well made. If you love 3d buy this title.
1401917232|5.0|Gary teaches many lessons in this book and with a sense of humor on the side. There are many books out there with the same message but it is our choice to pick and read which one resonates with us and whose words will make a difference in our lives.  We may think we are all on different paths but the truth is we are all heading in the same direction, it is just that we have made different choices on how we are going to get there.  Gary has shared many lessons in his newest title that gave me a whole new perspective at looking at life.  If you have been reading and reading looking for answers and feeling like you have been reading the same old story over and over; I would highly suggest reading Gary's new book, LOVE Has Forgotten No One as it really hasn't left anyone behind.  Love is the answer to life and Gary offers a few more perspectives so that you may actually see and believe this fact.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I really enjoyed every page of this book. This was a very difficult time, much poverty and sadness for the many orphaned children. this was so well written I felt their hopelness with every turn of the page. Would highly recommend.
0393325172|5.0|Not only fascinating , but the first of a 21 book series, documenting the British Admiralty during the Napoleonic wars. The movie is a pale image of the book
B00004TDTO|5.0|What else is there to say?  I saw this movie when I was 15 and have been enthralled and terrified of sharks ever since.  To me, it's not summer unless I watch this movie and I only had it as a VHS.  The bonus copy is interesting, it tells the back story of how the movie was made (however, it does take away some of the &#34;magic&#34;).  A must for all DVD libraries!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Lame, lame lame. I probably shouldn't compare the film to the book from which the title was borrowed, but I will. The storyline is just far too different and extremely weak. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.  Please skip it.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I really liked this book. Brandon sanderson has been my favorite author since the summer of 2012, when I went to Italy. I didn't have a good book to read, so my mom ended up downloading the mistaken trilogy on her kindle fire. Anyways, I love all Brandon Sanderson's books, and I hope all of you will too.

0446310786|5.0|I read this book many years ago and now my Granddaughter is reading it in a school assignment..so a reread was in store
0393312836|5.0|One of the most fascinating dystopian novels on the par with George Orwell's \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />  Although the superficial perusal may reveal simply a complex plot involving evel-ish protagonist -- \\"Little Alex,\\" a somewhat deeper look at the author and social issues involved at the time of the novel's writing will reveal a complex lace of multiple subplots and ideas.<br /><br />  Something to consider: for a long time Anthony Burgess was a member of Her Majesty's Secret Service. Despite long assignments to Far East and Middle Eastern countries, Anthony Burgess' specialty was Eastern Europe and Slavic languages. Hence the language of the \\"hood\\" in this novel: \\"Nadzet\\" -- translated as \\"teen.\\" (e.g. triNADZAT' \\" = 13; chetirNADZAT'= 14, etc...). Why do the major characters speak this lingo? Well the simple answer is that they are teenagers themselves. Hence the angst, aggressiveness, unbridled sexuality, the ugly behaviour, etc...<br /><br />  Something else to consider: why pepper the novel with Slavonic root-words? Why not use Arabic, French, or German? Possible answer: To those \\"in the know,\\" it may have looked as if there may have been a small but real chance that good old England may go Red (Philby, Burgess (different and unrelated Guy Burgess), and McLean have just defected [not in that order, of course]; the students and the unions are taking over the streets; Soviets are going into space and are arming every anti-colonial movement possible; etc, etc, etc.) As a specialist on Eastern Europe, Burgess had deep knowledge of miserable life behind the Iron Curtain, which he masterfully recreated in and transposed upon Great Britain in the \\"Clockwork.\\"<br /><br />  Trivia 1: it is rumored that while posted in Egypt, Burgess had a nervous breakdown. This led to his resignation from working for the Crown and the beginning of his literary career (this was brought up in several media interviews with the author later in his writing career).<br /><br />  Trivia 2: the original printing of the book differed greatly between the US and the UK versions as the American Version lacked the final chapter of the book! It is unclear why,  but the readers in the U.S. had to wait until 1972 to read the book in full.<br /><br />  Trivia 3: the superb film adaption of the plot by Stanley Kubrick  (the one that stars young Malcolm McDowell in the title role) was based on the American and NOT UK version, therefore it (the movie) lacks an absolutely key point of the book obvious to the reader in the last chapter of the original \\"Clockwork Orange.\\"<br /><br />Trivia 4: No connection was ever made between Guy Burgess (the Secret Service man who defected to the USSR) and Anthony Burgess (Secret Service man who had a nervous breakdown and then wrote this book). As far as I know not even the most paranoid counterintel John Bull has ever raised that question. Hm... Now that I see it written down,,, I wonder...<br /><br />  Overall, this is one of my most favourite books ever!
B005721Y7Y|5.0|This movie is a must-see and it is full of surprises. American Beauty does not fall short in any way!
0425238091|5.0|In my humble opinion, H.O.G. is not a \\"modern classic\\" - it is a MODERN ICON. Every doctor absolutely must read it. If you are even thinking of medicine (or surgery) as a career, it must be read at least three times: once in your medical school; the second time in your residency; and then finally when you are done with your fellowship, married (then divorced), have a kid (or two) that you never get to see, and a student loan that is twice the size of your mortgage-plus-alimony-plus-child support and a revolving thought in your head that keeps nagging \\"How the hell did I get into this cr@p?\\" ... yep, that's when you read it for the third time. Then get drunk and realize how stupid you were that you didn't figure it all out after Samuel Shem (that's H.O.G.'s author) spelled it out for you when you read it way back in medical school...<br />  An absolute gem.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Yes, I know this borrowed so heavily from the original Wrath of Khan that it can be considered a prequel and much talk has already been provided regarding that issue, as well as various summaries and opinions.  I will forego that and write regarding only the quality of the disc on Blu Ray.  I have not watched the 3D version yet so this review focuses only upon the 2D version watched on a new Panasonic ZT series 65\\" monitor.<br /><br />VIDEO.....<br />  You couldn't have had a film such as this without the extensive use of CGI and other special effects.  That said, the various effects do not cheapen the image with poor production like you might see in those 'Sharkanodo vs DinoCroc'  sci fi films you watch on the Sci Fi channel.  All special effects are done very well in my opinion and add to the story line.  A huge problem with special effects laden films is that often the film becomes about the FX and not the characters or story line.  Not so with Star Trek into Darkness.  The encode to Blu Ray provides a very clean image with excellent contrast and color resolution.  The majority of the color grading is fairly cool to the viewer but tends to warm up with close ups.  At no point did I see any distracting or noticeable artifacts or dirt in the imaging and details, even in the shadow areas, are easily discernible.  Mbps rate appeared to average in the low thirties and while some dismiss the Mbps rate as being unimportant, I find that the higher it is, the better the imaging.  While you may or may not like the film as I did, the video transfer to Blu Ray is quite excellent.<br /><br />AUDIO.....<br />  Was very pleased that both a 5.1 and 7.1 mix was offered and a lossless audio codec was used.  I watched the film using the 7.1 audio for my 7.1 home theater setup.  There is so much going on in this film's audio mix that the dialogue and foley fx battle for your attention.  This doesn't mean that you have to adjust your remote's volume control once set as both dialogue and foley audio are properly balanced, it's just that during the many action scenes the surround audio fully envelopes you and creates one of those 'You are there' moments.  There is a great amount of discreet directionality to all 6 of the surrounds and panning from front to rear and rear to front is frequent.  Never the less, the dialogue center channel has most of the heavy lifting as it does in every movie and it does so just fine.  The LFE sub channel will earn its stripes as it will be in constant use.  I would suggest that viewers be careful regarding their sub channel as I often find friends who have it set far too high.  The sub should not be noticeable as a discreet channel as low end bass is non-directional.  The mix of audio was simply excellent in 7.1 and I can safely come to the conclusion is that if you have a 5.1 system, as most do, then you will find the directionality of the audio to be one of the best in your collection.  The lossless audio really deserves 5 stars;<br /><br />EXTRAS.....<br />  There are a number of extras on the Blu Ray regarding many aspects of what it took to make this film.  However, I did not have the time as yet to watch them so I will not comment upon the quality of these usually short docs.  However, there are also several 'previews' of other films that come up when you put the blu ray in.  This annoys the heck out of me as it forces you to  pay for nothing more than advertising which takes up valuable disc space causing for even more compression to be placed upon the film you are buying.  Who wants to pay for an ad?  I just want to pay for a film, in this case, Star Trek.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the Blu Ray disc and I do hope  that this review has been of some help to you regarding your purchase.  If so, hopefully, my other reviews will as well.<br />Thanks for readingand foley audio are properly balanced, it's just that during the many action scenes the surround audio fully envelopes you and creates one of those 'You are there' moments.

B0090EHVMC|5.0|The kids loved the movie!<br />But as adults I have to say that we really enjoyed it. It was funny, silly, all the things we love about dr. Seuss.<br />I'm not a tree higher but the movie also showed a good lesson on the environment.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Enjoyed the read.  The author described the characters so well that I could visualize them as I read.  I was happy with ending.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played, I enjoyed playing!  I was stuck! Could not look away!  Highly recommended!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Really really good - and almost believable.<br />Watched all the season 1 episodes within 2 days.  First rate acting from great stars.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a really fun app. All different sounds that you can combine the way you like. When I first got it, I spent an hour just trying out all the different combinations
B007BVOEPI|3.0|That's it - so far a little boring - it's rare that I don't get into something.  I've actually not enthusiastic to see the next video.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read! Once you start you can't stop reading. Best book I read all year. It was great revisiting Dan Torrance again
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Must see TV...Great show and Great Cast and visiting actors...a Must See!! what else can one say it is Great
B005HSGB6W|5.0|Anthony Burgess's novel, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", is a book of literary merit because it gives an argument that has yet to be solved by any person--the choice of moral choice. By this I mean is it better to be bad, but like it, or to be forced to be good. This argument is a popular choice in many books nowadays. It is included in the \\"Matched\\" trilogy, \\"Anthem\\", and the \\"Divergent\\" Trilogy. However, unlike these books, \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" gives this argument that involves frequent uses of what the main character, Alex, states as \\"ultra-violence\\". Alex is a fifteen-year old delinquent that travels a long way morally by the end of the book. Anthony also comments on the adolescent population using frequent demonstrations. By using \\"nadsat\\", Anthony Burgess's Russian-influenced version of English, he comments on the teenage slang frequent in his time period (and currently still going on now). He also comments on the fact that violence is childish due to the fact that once Alex grows up, he decides to settle down. Throughout the book there are vivid descriptions of assault and rape, given and received, by Alex. For the first half of the novel Alex is the one dishing it out but after the Ludovico treatment, is received by Alex. Due to this imagery I would have to give it a rating of \\"R\\" mainly because of the violent content. But when looking back, I did enjoy the novel, and feel it is a great book of literary merit, which is why I give it a five-out-of-five rating. And I wouldn't change a thing in Burgess's novel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Out of the three books, I must say that this one was my favorite.  All of the craziness ended.  Now everyone is fifty shades of happy.
0765334798|2.0|\\"Redshirts\\" assumes that you know (and quite possibly love) \\"Star-Trek\\".  The title of the novel is the first clue, however if you are like me and never watched anything \\"Star-Trek\\", it could be easily overlooked.  The story is short - which is a good thing considering characterization and interesting plotlines are devoid within the novel - followed by three codas that follow some of the secondary characters.<br /><br />In the future, the Intrepid is the flagship of the line.  However there are a multitude of problems with the ship, most notably its mortality rate, especially among new members on \\"away teams\\".  Andrew Dahl, who is newly assigned to the ship, begins to explore this interesting fact with some friends and Jenkins, a man who skulks within the walls of the ship.  The result is a convoluted mess that sends science fiction tropes (time travel, voodoo science, and bad uniforms) intertwining with laughably poor plot threads.<br /><br />Although Scalzi was actively parodying SF movies, books, and shows, there is also a sense that he wanted to cover more within this novel.  Throughout the text there are passages of solipsism and divulges in theology that questions what it means to be \\"real;\\" however since these questions never really go anywhere, they do not add to the novel.  And if something doesn't really add to the overall novel, than what is the point of having it in the first place?<br /><br />While the main narrative within \\"Redshirts\\" is only 231 pages, that page count is extremely bloated when one figures how much could have been removed from the story without depriving the audience of crucial details.  By my estimate, at least a third of the narrative could have been removed from the text. The plotting is straightforward despite Scalzi's efforts to complicate things through metafictional elements.  Similarly, the characterization is one dimensional and boring.  Scalzi tries to cover his behind by giving a reason why the characters seem like cardboard cutouts with no real sense of backstory, but it does not work in his favor.  Trying to read a novel with characters you are unemotionally invested in is hard work.  I wanted to like Andrew Dahl and friends, but there were never any reason to do so.<br /><br />As far as the humor is concerned, I must be barren of all things comical, because I read through this novel without laughing and only briefly cracking a smile.  The dialog that was meant to be clever and witty comes across as awkward and unnatural.  And the conflicts that were supposed to make the reader laugh only made me question Scalzi's own humor.<br /><br />I will say that once the principle story is finished, there are two interesting codas.  There are supposed to be three, but one was more inline with the main story, which unfortunately meant it was uninteresting.  The second and third codas are much more successful than anything else within this novel.  They are emotional and delightful to read, making it all the more jarring considering they came after the main narrative.  They end the book on a high note, but since the first three quarters of the book was so disastrous, they cannot redeem the novel.<br /><br />Two Starscutouts with no real sense of backstory, but it does not work in his favor.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|It's not a traditional way to tell a story but it works. By using a series of interviews with people involved in the zombie war, the origins, the fighting and the ultimate defeat of the zombie threat unfolds. The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because the zombies can apparently walk across the bottom of the ocean and cross continents. Of course you have to suspend disbelief somewhat to enter the zombie world but I like to assume that zombies would still be subject to the laws of physics. At the bottom of the ocean the pressure would crush any living thing except one specially adapted to life at that depth. It's never explained how they could do that and I felt that was an idea that simply couldn't hold water.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this app because  it was my dream to have a horse since I was a little girl but it came true on a app :)
B00FEHXISA|4.0|It even has fireworks!<br /><br />This was a great conclusion to the trilogy after a fine first film and a shaky second film.  If you ever have an Iron Man party, though, you can get everyone psyched up with the first one and serve dinner, play volleyball or take a walk during the second one and then cuddle up on the sofa (cuz yeah it's kind of a geek date movie) for the third one.<br /><br />Stick around for the scene after the credits that has become standard for Iron Man films.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|This is a great read. I want to read more of this kind of book. Spill some more words on pages for us to read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book to my daughter and we both had a great time with it.<br />Very moving.<br />Very recommended!!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Well only reason downloaded was to get auras in the gAme epic. I played this game till level 10 and never got them.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|A captivating read you won't want to put down. One day it'll be a movie... And it will be great.
1936891026|2.0|It's ok that you have never seen a painting from Hitler but it doesn't mean that he didn't paint. He didn't become a painter because he was rejected twice by the school in Vienna. I only read a part of the preview and found this error.
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|Easy to pick cards with positive joyful words, these words are a good way to start the day. Thank you.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show is very well written and the cast is hilarious. I'm amazed at how they've kept it interesting, without reaching too far, for 8 seasons.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I have been losing sleep just to catch up on episodes. Lol! I can't wait to see what happens next!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Very well written, if a bit predictable. But this has the beginnings of a great series. Read it, now. :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Different from other games I've played. My daughter and I loved it.  She is 7 but was able to figure out things on her own.
0307949486|5.0|Parts of it were horrible to read, but I loved it. The rape scene and the torture scene were difficult to read, especially as my memory works way better than my imagination. I saw the American version of the movie first and so, was able to remember the very graphic way it was filmed as I was reading, instead of relying on my own imagination, which is not nearly as sadistically creative as the director of the movie. But all this made it a really gripping book to read. Larsson was a great crime/horror author, imagine what he could have written if he was still with us today.
B00E03ULJS|2.0|As EDM rides into a mainstream genre, you will see lots of artists try to catch fame by riding that wave. Sadly, this is just another generic EDM album, with little difference than other albums.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. The DVD works fine not issues. I enjoy a good Christian movie with good story lines and people.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I just finished  reading this trilogy for the second time, it truly doesn't get old. You could read it over an over and Suzanne Collins would still have you on the edge of your seat.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This is a classic. I think we've all seen this movie at least once.  It's the kind of movie that puts you in the mood to take a day off.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Sorry I downloaded this one.  Wish I knew how to eliminate it from my Kindle.  It brought me no pleasure at all.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Waiting on 4 now.  Love this season. Wish there was more to see.  Characters are great and emotionally wonderful.  Love it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Surprisingly interesting read.  I originally thought it would be a sappy sad diversion of the overly romantic overload of fast reads on the market. But.  It was well written and the story ad some teeth to it.  It held my attention throughout with we'll drawn substantive characters
B00F2362IE|1.0|Bought this game for my kid. He loves TMNT and was super excited to play. Problem is, he can't play it. When we open the game we just get a black loading screen that never goes away. The few times it worked it was a good game. The problem is it hardly ever works. Fix the load screen thing and I'll gladly change to five stars.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book makes you think...and understand what it is that makes us human. It's a very touching recounting of a year that those of us who have luckily never experienced such a year need to read. Thank you, Piper.
0596805888|5.0|Bought for my husband as a birthday gift--he loved it! He is a technical, geeky kind of person who always asks complicated questions. This book satisfies his scientific curiosity about cooking and saves me from cooking-related questions that I have no answer to.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|People do your damn research before buying and complaining on a game review. How did you expect action and hardcore gameplay from this bundle? These games aren't meant to be fast and explosive. These are a different genre of games. More so games as art. I applaud the developers for making these type of games. Mellow and relaxing, they deliver soothing and pleasant gameplay for older gamers that can appreciate a fresh breath of design. I'm 37, I've been playing since pong. I play pc, xbox 360, ps3 and ps vita. I look forward to more stylish games like this that connect with your mind and thoughts rather than twitch frantic frenzied call of duty recycled, repetitive garbage. 5 stars for this bundle. Ground breaking. That is all. Enjoy.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|This movie taught me one thing: a horrible soundtrack can absolutely ruin the feel of a movie. In this case, the hip-hop soundtrack was inappropriate. It did not fit the period and I found it really distructing.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Judge Jury executioner-what else but the Judge.  A trap for the Judge, impossible odds Dsedd wins barely.  Bad gal Loses
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Loved this movie! It was incredibly funny and smart. Emma stone's acting is a huge treat, and the plot is surprising and fresh. Highly recommended!
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|Eleanor lives in a terrible home in poverty and escapes her situation with her boyfriend,  Park.  You feel really sorry for Eleanor and want her to get away from her horrible stepfather and live the life she deserves.  Story is a little emotional to read and not really sure that the topics are young adult.
B005544TRQ|5.0|this is a very good series.  can't wait to start season two<br />We recommend it to all of our friends
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Jojo Moyes did a fabulous job of portraying the challenges when a person's life is completely turned upside down due to a devastating accident.  The impact takes a toll not only on the individual but also on everyone surrounding him.  I highly recommend this book.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent writing and cast. First rate television show. I started watching The Good Wife here on Amazon.  Now, I am caught up to begin watching the new season on regular tv. This show is worth watching.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book had multiple issues for our book club to discuss. Interesting characters and varying family dynamics helped me give it 4 stars.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is a great app! It is amazing how you can do 1,000s of styles on 1 person :) it's really fun to just pretend for them to be costumers or ask someone to make you with the hair things! I REALLY recommend this app! GOOD LUCKK!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Even if I wasn't a Stephen King fan I'd love this book!  And, if you haven't read The Shining (make sure you do!), you won't be lost reading this one first.<br /><br />The characters develop at a perfect pace, enough humor and current info to bring you into their lives and happenings.  Lots of supernatural and OMG moments, enough twists to keep you guessing, realistic locations.<br /><br />If you're a first time reader for this author - this book will make you want to read more of his works.  If you're like me and wondered &#34;what ever happened to...?&#34; grab this book!
B001I9B9I4|5.0|I like the movie because it shows parents that children grow up to be adults and they can't hold on to them. They need to let go.
0439023513|5.0|Great read!  If you love dypstopian society books, like [[ASIN:B00F3ETIOC Wayward: The Olympus Arc (Kindle Edition)]], you'll love this trilogy.  You really connect with the characters and their struggles.  You'll be sad it's over at the end.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! One of the most touching books I have ever read.<br />Magnificent heart wrenching I cried.
0545586178|5.0|Great book!  I recommend reading the whole trilogy.  I love dystopian world building like in [[ASIN:B00F3ETIOC Wayward: The Olympus Arc (Kindle Edition)]].  You will really connect with the characters and their struggles.  Definitely worth the time to read.
0385528787|4.0|I was a bit disappointed by this. It didn't quite have the punch of Oryx and Crake or In The Year of The Flood.  Some of the suspense and brilliant build-up the other books had is missing. I really wanted to know what happened to all of these people I fell in love with. I wanted it to all wrap up.  I wanted more of the dangers and activity with the MaddAddam group to be clarified and that was skimmed over. I was intrigued by Zeb's story and Adam.... but it took so long to unfold, without the dramatic flair from the other two books.  It was ok. I still liked it, because the story was good, but something was missing.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The 10th doctor is probably STILL my favorite.  This was an amazing 3 seasons of time & space travel adventure.  I've gone through all of the 9th, 10th & 11th doctors adventures 3 or 4 times and could watch them all again.  Best TV out there!  5 STARS!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|season 2 is a wild ride. be ready to hang on to your hat. you too, Chicken Lady. Yes, a great and complex tale.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Super fun and imaginative.  Kids of all ages enjoy these short clips. Very funny and endearing little shows. I would definitely recommend this show.
B005K17RU0|5.0|WeatherBug puts too many cookies on your computer and makes it crash.  I recommend this instead for a more accurate weather report.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have had this on other products such as my smart phone and touch pad and it is very entertaining. Still have a lot of levels to go through  I love those little  birds and pigs.
B006YRVY2G|5.0|When I purchased the sountrack to the 2nd series of bbc Sherlock, I was a little skeptical of the condition of the CD. But when it arrived, I was very pleased to discover it was quite untouched. The outside of the case had no damage or material injuries, and the disc was smooth and flawless. I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone who enjoys good product quality!
B001EHDQFO|5.0|Feeling stuck and overwhelmed with your life and not sure how to move forward? This book will help you to look at struggles you face and suggest ways to take small steps in the right direction. It also had me asking questions of myself to help open myself up more creatively (something I have always struggled with). This book can help ANYONE with ANY type of problem. I loved this book and would suggest it to everyone!
B004132HZS|5.0|I purchased the first series of bbc Sherlock and the condition of the DVD is incredible! It's like new, no scratches on the disc and the outside is lightly used. I would (and will) definitely recommend this seller if you are looking for 5-star service!!!
B0012DP8A6|4.0|It's difficult to say why I like this movie, but I really do.  It's innocent, and not really scary at all.  The musical interludes are kitschy but well done.  Steve Martin is wonderful as the sadistic dentist.  It's not my usual fare, but I like it.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Zombies.  You either love 'em, hate 'em, or just don't get 'em!  If you're a lover of Zombies, you'll enjoy this fun ride.  The pace stays crazy throughout.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I loved this book, but I'm not writing a review when it's already been well covered. Buy this book and the book after, and you'll be eagerly awaiting the 3rd one too.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|At first a little difficult to get into as all of the characters are introduced but it moves pretty fast once you get into it.  Who knows all of the possibilities that this wonderful life had to offer?
B001NKI60W|5.0|No, the vocals aren't very good, but they don't bug me all that much. These characters sell their songs well, the acting is great, and the story is just one big dance party!! This movie is so incredibly FUN, that I can't help watching it over and over again. I absolutely love it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|A+++ Show is great! Can't stop watching ;) story lines, talented cast, definitely NOT predictable court room drama. Would recommend!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Disney has done it again! Randy Newman's music is catchy, I love the characters, I love the message, and the movie is beautifully done as a whole. I admit I get a bit bored in the very middle...they stay frogs a little too long for me, right around the hillbilly scene I'm ready to fast forward to the climax, but I DO really love this film. My niece also loves watching it with me! Some crazy people are concerned about the voodoo scenes being too scary I'm sure, but I would disagree, and my princess and rainbow loving 3 year old niece has never had a problem with it. These songs stay with me for days, and there was a period of time when I was watching this movie at least once a day with my little girl! It'll never beat out &#34;Tangled&#34;, I'm sure, but this could be her 2nd favorite movie, and it's definitely one of my top 10 disney favorites.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|if not as they say does not help because you dont get the real game on the kindle fire please check
B00127RAJY|4.0|this one always gets my heart pumping! I only do level one because two and three are pretty hard on my knees, and I would have to adjust some of the moves. However, I really like the program Jillian has put together, and it always leaves me feeling accomplished once I've finished. I love that it is so short!
B00AALX5SI|4.0|I did not give this movie 5 stars because there really isn't a plot.  However it did have a lot of backstage scenes that I found very interesting. I found it entertaining throughout.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|The book was shallow, the writing redundant, there was no real action. Also not very believable, and couldn't like any of the characters. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If you liked season one and two, this one won't disappoint you.  It keeps you wanting more and more.  Just excellent.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I really did not think I would like this show, but I am hooked.  Not only with the characters, but the history that happens, such as the telelphone, electric lights, etc.,
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Along with need for speed most wanted game it's one of the most clear HD racing game it's one of the most awesome game created.  I give  this game 5.
B00AEFYS8G|5.0|Yes its slow...but this is one of the best westerns I have ever seen. My favorite is Unforgiven but this may be a close (very close) second.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Attempts to auto correct words even when I spell them correctly. The biggest issue is that it will assume words you use more often are the intended word you want to use *now*.<br /><br />E.g., I will type \\"doesn't\\" and it will be auto corrected to \\"didn't\\"... I am not sure if that is because I use \\"didn't\\" more? It is a pain to repeatedly go back and correct. Don't get me started on using nouns.<br /><br />You type, not swype, a noun and it will auto correct. I will make an effort to NOT swype because I know the word will not be there but this stupid app thinks it knows better and will auto correct. You do this multiple times until it 'learns'. More often than not the word it replaces makes absolutely no sense in the sentence.. really disappointed. Not to mention the time required to give this app time to 'learn' and it still is awful.<br /><br />Lastly, why does this app love FIR? Why can't it use FOR correctly...
B004BSFC46|5.0|Great toys for curious kids.  Interesting sounds and vibrant colors help stir their imagination.  Very good product for the price.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Awesome. I can't wait to get to Season 3. The turn in the events is always unpredictable and I love it!
B004MYFV0O|5.0|This book helped me a lot and its very fun.<br />It's a very good choice and I recommend<br />The author likes to joke around in this book so it makes reading fun.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard has such a beautiful and strong soul...I really admire the way she approaches life and all the overwhelming challenges she has faced...this book is an incredible account of her experience and I'm so happy that she has found her way home with her family where she belongs :)

B00F91RYL8|3.0|We hesitated to download since the reviews were so low, but I can say that our family found ourselves intensely glued to the screen with many times at the edge of the couch! I liked the &#34;Patient Zero&#34; concept behind the Zombie epidemic, didn't care for the relationship/family aspect of Brad Pitt's family in the movie as it wasn't believable.  (But, then again, look what happened to J.Aniston when you match up your then husband with Jolie in a movie! I'd pick a non-descript actress as well.) the ending was abrupt but overall was a fair rainy day watch.
B004MPESSY|4.0|This movie is the new standard for revenge flicks! If you crave depravity and gore, this is your movie, the original was good but this version makes it look like a Disney movie. LOVED it, am buying it and making my friends watch it.... Maybe with some fishing hooks hahahaha
B00498YZH8|2.0|This movie is not one that will make you feel good. A 17 yr. old girl taking care of the family, her mother isn't &#34;right&#34;, her dad is missing and their shack of a house is ready to be taken away. Much more to see, but once was enough for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game was good but at the beginning it was slow but it was still fun to  play anyways<br />.
B008RKIACK|5.0|Brought back memories.  I hope Hollywood remakes this cult classic.  Great story, great theme song at the end too.  Very cool film from back in the day.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Great show! Super fun! Loved all the chsracters. Music was original. Wished they hadn't canceled it!!! Want it back!! Please!
B000H4TX9I|5.0|at this point Firefly has become enough of a &#34;cult classic&#34; not much more needs to be said. if your in the mood for a sifi show with a bit of everything this is it
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I love the continuing saga from The Fall Of Giants. The story has variations, nerve and is exciting from first to last pave!<br />Reccomend !
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Guess I didn't know the movie was about zombies...I thought it was kinda dumb and didn't give Brad Pitt much to work with.

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Excellent as always!!  Wish they had all the board built though. Beat it now waiting for more boards to play.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Doesn't open and crashes all the time. Not worth the $3.99. I've had many free games that worked perfectly. This is cheap.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|A little long, but a great, exciting story.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat and it's impossible to guess the ending.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A riveting story. It makes you proud to be American!!! It makes you want to be a SEAL.Loved it!!! GO NAVY!!!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Wish I had watched it before attending Comic Con, then I would have known what everyone was talking about and would have made it a point to attend the Marvel panel.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Not too scary, just the right amount of horror, grossness and action. Good movie for a chilly Saturday night to be tucked up under your honey for protection.  I would watch it again.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Absolutely one of the best games ever.lot's of fun easy to play.but hard to beat.very entertaining.a must have for any gamer.excellent!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My son needed this for college stuff, had no problems loading it and uses it<br />without a problem. Hope that helps.
B00728DYRO|5.0|I like this book because I think that it is a great introduction to the series and it is able to valence out the action and adventure feeling with the mystical feeling.
B00E00RB5I|3.0|Classic Earth Wind and Fire.<br />This is how you stand the test of time from vocals to the band. Simply Amazing
B001HBYHFA|5.0|If you have not seen this sy-fy movie, better watch right now. Star Wars or Star Trek fan, this beats both shows. Yes you heard that right, this show has those movies beat hands down, The short lived t.v. series, was all fan base driven. Look at it this way, when is the last time you have heard a tv show that was cancelled after the pilot(picked up by another station(you lost out Fox). Made into a Major motion picture.<br />  I also guarantee you you will go and by the box dvd of Serenity the tv show. Great acting and no aliens and it is like the wild west in the outer planets.  Nathan Fillion and Adam Badwin are 2 names in the crew go rent this to find out the rest.<br />  One of Joss Wedens best films and tv series.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Quality acting, great story lines, more Will/ Alicia needed. Looking forward to the upcoming season. How can Alicia leave Lockhart/Gardner????
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great show that has captured and held the attention of both me and my husband. There are many nights we have to force ourselves not to watch another episode!
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Very good movie, it is one of my favorites, they did take creative licensing with the movie from the comics, but still highly recommended.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This has to be my favorite Marvel movie they have made so far, very nice job in picking the new actor to play the Hulk. The interactions between the Avengers was very well done on how hey come together as a team. This movie makes me excited for future Marvel movies. If you haven't seen this yet then I recommend that you at least give it a try.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is so fun I think it will be good for kids like 3 to how ever old you are
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Not only is it easy, but it's addicting. More addicting than hammering the court room wall with a gaffel. I recommend it to any one who likes cut the rope, and Pudding.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|You can not beat a free game this fun. I have been playing this game for awhile now on facebook and was happy to see it on amazon as a free game for my tablet.I have spent many hours on this game and I just love it.the farther you get in the game the funner it becomes. If I have anything to say bad about this game is that on my tablet even though it has a very large screen I can not chose the little extras button on here like I can on facebook which makes it harder to get really high scores. Over all a great game and you can't beat the price of free.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It will make you laugh, cry and everything in between. It is so amazing to hear and feel what someone with cancer feels.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Would recommend. Held my interest, however the writing style is a little infuriating. I would just get into what a character was going and then had to jump to a different one.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Very different in plot and in tone from thebNetflix movie. Still an excellent book if you are interested in criminal justice issues.
0670026638|5.0|There are many layers to this wonderfully structured book.  It is informative and entertaining at the same time.  A lot to think about.  I liked all the characters and the way the book was structured.  Ms. Ozeki is one of the few non-scientists authors that writes about quantum mechanics without becoming ridiculous and misusing the subject.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Thanks to AutoRip I can listen to this before the actual disc arrives.<br /><br />The new Vapor Trails remix sounds really good, it feels like I'm listening to all-new music. It's like a power washer was applied, forcing out all the static and noise dirt. They must have included pieces or takes that were previously on the cutting room floor, there is now stuff in the songs I hadn't heard/noticed before. Example is a little guitar solo after the bass solo part in Ceiling Unlimited.<br /><br />Vocal tracks are totally different in some cases, like in Peaceable Kingdom.  They had to have re-recorded some of this.<br /><br />After listening to the \\"good\\" one I'll have to listen to the old one to see if I can pick out some of this that was hidden by the noise, but there is definitely more stuff that wasn't in the old mix. Feels like it is 20% different, as if the original release was the demo for the real thing.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I like Coming from Reality better, but this album has some great tracks.  Here is a man who understands the contradictions of modern life and the difficulties the common people face in a world infused with the influence of money.  So glad I discovered him through &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Its a good read<br />Its to the point<br />Its got useful hard earned practical business knowledge.<br />As a user of CDBaby I am admirer for Dereks work.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|So awesome that this won the 2013 Oscar for best documentary.  What a story - of an artist who didn't make it in the U.S. in the early 1970s, through underground channels became a superstar in South Africa (without his knowledge), fueling the anti-apartheid movement, was thought to be dead, was found &#34;alive and kicking&#34; in 1998, was brought to So. Africa for 6 sold-out concerts with adoring fans, and is now receiving way overdue recognition in the U.S. for his contribution to our music and societal culture.  He lives in the same house in downtown Detroit as he did 40 years ago and actually returned to construction work when his career never took off.  I hope he has retired from manual labor by now and is receiving the monetary rewards for his wonderful music that he richly deserves.  Bless him.  I bought the two CDs (&#34;Cold Fact&#34; and &#34;Coming from Reality&#34;) and the DVD to support him.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|Excellent...fabulous story & the music WOWI can't watch it enough. I wake up singing the music! Buy it you will love it!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Love this album.  This guy has an anti-establishment message that resonates 40 years after the music was written.  He deserves a wider audience and hopefully is getting it.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I rate this the highest score possible because of all the game apps I have tried, this one has the greatest enjoyment factor for me.  To me, the thought and creativity that I must engage in to succeed to different levels keeps me enthused.  The ways I have to &#34;design&#34; the paths for the sugar to take can be in a virtually infinite array, and no two tries at any level are ever exactly the same.  The game also works flawlessly.  One final feature that I really appreciate is the simple, but enticing jazz theme music... it gives playing the game a really nice feel.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|great show would recommend to others love the series makes it easier to keep up with the show would recommend
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I wasn't able to watch the shows when they were originally aired but am just thrilled to have been able to watch them on my Kindle.  I am looking forward to season 3.  The story lines and the characters are wonderful!
B00003INJ6|5.0|I enjoy different genres of music and have heard much of Deep Purple, but never purchased them until now. I bought the album for the song &#34;Hush,&#34; after attending a Black Crowes show where they ended with a cover of the song, but I also found the entire album to be brilliant. I bought this and Machine Head and it is amazing how much of their sound changed in the years between these two albums. I like Machine Head, but Shades of Deep Purple I feel is much better. I've already turned some friends onto this album and plan in the future to purchase some more of their albums.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a fun activity that requires attention to detail but not timed. It is different from card games and a nice diversion - the games don't take too long.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|The memory cards seems to lock into place making it a bit harder to get out but also makes it more reliable to keep them in so they don't fall out...nicely built.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My original cable was damaged and the replacement was sent immediately so there was no disruption to my charging and using my Kindle.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is fun and challenging. The 5x5 is fairly easy and the 10x10 is much harder. Nice free app of the day.
B001DUKHXQ|3.0|The picture disc is cool and all, but I'd have been willing to spend another $10 to at least get a jacket to put it in.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Excellent start! I really can't wait to see where they go with this! I love Clark Gregg and his character, and am SO GLAD they brought him back!
B00DHPN7G4|4.0|Delivered as promised. Helps with &#34;panic knifing&#34; which is why I purchased them. You do have to be careful when removing as the instructions describe. IF the instructions were easier to read, i.e. all in English, I would have given 5 stars.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I don't really have any words to describe this book... But I have to use 5 more words... So... Hi!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The updated version always crashes, was not able to use this app at all. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still crashes.
B00E9P957Q|3.0|While this set sounds great and is comparatively a good deal (especially for someone like me who only recently got into Rush and had not picked up any albums post-Presto), it does not \\"faithfully reproduce original artwork.\\"  Every album comes in a cardboard sleeve with front and back artwork and nothing else.  A larger booklet comes with the set that has lyrics reprinted for every album and...nothing else.  No artwork, liner notes, credits, thank yous, etc.  While the average person might not care about that, one of my favorite parts about actually purchasing a physical copy of an album is taking in all of that information.  It is a bargain when you consider the price of this averages out to about 5 bucks per album but if I had to do it over, I would probably just bargain shop and get each album individually for a few bucks more.  On the plus side, I have heard that these are sonically better than the originals (which I admittedly have not heard) and the inclusion of the remixed Vapor Trails is a very welcome addition.  If only the description was more forthcoming, I believe any Rush fan could make a educated decision about whether they should purchase this.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I heart Park.  I totally do.  And I'm 40.<br /><br />Seriously, it's hard to explain in words how much I enjoyed this book.  I didn't want the tale of Eleanor & Park to end & it stuck in my head & heart for quite some time after reading.  Actually, I listened to the audio version on a road trip.  It was perfect, minus blinking through tears to see the road a few times.  I'm sure I'd equally love the book but the narration was fantastic, especially Park (&  his imitation of his mom).  I especially loved the \\"Gaaaawd!\\"s & the \\"Jezzzzus\\" - I was so that teen.<br /><br />When the audiobook was complete, I had the next book ready to go on my playlist but I couldn't listen to it.  I wasn't ready to move on.  I sat in silence for the rest of my 2 hour drive just thinking about Eleanor & Park.  I actually wish I had had some Smiths or Joy Division as background to my thoughts.<br /><br />This is one of the most beautiful, sweet, & totally engrossing books I've read in a while.  I can't let go of Eleanor & Park.  You just can't loosen yourself from a Vulcan handhold.<br /><br />A must read.  5 stars.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is great. I like to keep my mind busy especially when I relax and this game definitly does that!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A perfect calculator that is easy to use and has a very clean design, needs no improvement. I like the color scheme.
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|This film is so far removed from the book that I could not even finish watching. Yes, I am \\"the book is always better crowd\\", but I can typically look past that and enjoy the film. This was not the case with this film. Basically, only the names are the same. Glad I only rented it!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|One of the best reacher books he just gets better with age.  Hard to put down once you start reading.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|At first I thought it was multiple stories but loved the way it all tied in. Great great story. I couldn't put it down read in one day!!!
B00A285OOW|4.0|I read the story of King Henry Tudor and Queen Elizabeth while watching &#34;The White Queen&#34; mini series. In &#34;The White Queen&#34; Lord Stanley tells Lady Margaret that Henry will have to walk past 5 coffins (King Edward, Edwards two songs, Richard (Edwards brother) and Richard's son) to gain the throne. And that's exactly what Henry did. Henry's own trechery never allows him to trust his wife, a York princess making for a miserable marriage/life.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|once I started watching the series I couldn't stop until I had watched all three seasons!  I hope they don't stop there!  I hope there is a forth season!  If so I can't wait to watch the rest!  I would recommend Downton Abbey to everyone. Lots of drama, suspense and love!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I was a serious student, but somehow missed Jane Austen. After reading some wannabe Austen books I decided to try the real thing and I was hooked.
B000002G26|5.0|I love this CD. I had one a long time ago, and I was very glad I could find a replacement. The music takes me back to a happy time in life. Good pricing, and fast shipping.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|2013 has been the year of Haim. From dominating the summer festival circuit to performing for prime ministers and gaining rabid fans the world over--these three sisters from California have done all of this without an official LP to their name. Now that it's finally here, it's both what I had hoped for as well as refreshingly surprising. To say that their music contains a whole host of influences is an understatement, yet the sisters ground their many influences in their sweet perfect harmonies and bouncy feel good attitude floating throughout the entire album.<br /><br />The Haim sisters come from a family of accomplished musicians which makes sense as their technical skill and ability to craft songs is borderline genius. The flitting nuances and subtleties come not just from musicians who love music and can sing and play, but those who have deeply lived and breathed music their entire lives as well as exposed to an incredible range of music from birth. Thus the music has an organic and effortless appeal despite the many disparate tones which belies the tremendous talent it takes to create an album like this. Musically, this album really surprised me as it manages to both be almost immediately accessible as well as satisfying with real weight.<br /><br />The first three tracks off the album make for a 1-2-3 punch of frankly some of the best pop music of 2013. \\"Forever\\" is my favorite out of the three currently, but ask me in another month or two and it might well be \\"The Wire\\" or \\"Falling.\\" \\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\" has a nice r&b influence, and while upbeat is one of the more serious and emotional tracks on the album. \\"Days Are Gone\\" is a really fun meld of electronic and folk with a strange little almost chirping synth sound in parts and also sees the appearance of Alana with lead vocal duties. Danielle has the majority of lead vocals on the album, but Alana and Este each take turns stepping up to mike. \\"My Song 5\\" is another showstopper with a wicked deep grunge industrial feel paired with a bass line that pops in and out making for a very odd yet memorable moment. \\"Let Me Go\\" is a continuation of the darker feel to the latter half of the album and really shows just how much depth these girls have.<br /><br />If I had just one minor criticism of this album, it's that sometimes the Haim sisters are too professional and polished for their own good. Produced by Ariel Rechtshaid (Vampire Weekend, Alex Clare, We Are Scientists) this album would have benefited from the vocals instead of the always the music conveying the angrier emotions. Imperfections are what make us human, and a few broken notes or a raw breakdown thrown in some songs would have made it a bit more relatable. Their live wild/hippie/rockstar personas don't quite match up with the very tight and technically sound song writing and instrumentals, and I think they need to work on a way to better mesh their personalities into their music. You can be wild and carefree while still being an un-apologetically serious musician.<br /><br />If you asked me to outright define Haim's sound, the best I could do is throw a bunch words out there and hope a few stick. I'm not sure I've ever heard such an effortless amalgamation of influences turned into one compelling and consistent feel. I realize I'm gushing about this album, but Haim is here to stay and their obvious passion paired with their breadth of knowledge and talent makes them the type of artists that I'm sure I'll still be hearing new albums from 30 years from now. I don't want to detract from the amount of blood, sweat and tears these girls have spent working for this moment---but they have a magic that can't be taught or bought. This music is a piece of their soul. Adventurous, Daring, Bubbly and so very SoCal. And they're only just beginning. Highly recommend.unge industrial feel paired with a bass line that pops in and out making for a very odd yet memorable moment. \\"Let Me Go\\" is a continuation of the darker feel to the latter half of the album and really shows just how much depth these girls have.<br /><br />If I had just one minor criticism of this album, it's that sometimes the Haim sisters are too professional and polished for their own good.

B009AMANBA|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I enjoy historical dramas e.g. Barry Lyndon by Kubrick, and other movies based on historical figures e.g. Citizen Kane, Patton etc.  But I just found Lincoln to be too slowly paced and too much emphasis on passing the 13th Amendment rather than on the Civil War.<br /><br />Of course, it is a well made film with fine acting.
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|Two things first: the majority of songs on this album don't come anywhere close to the radio friendliness of \\"Royals\\" and this album is most certainly a grower instead of an immediate sugar rush. Best advice--find these songs on YouTube or elsewhere and really listen before you decide whether or not buying the entire album is for you. You will be disappointed if you're expecting 10 songs similar to \\"Royals\\", but if you keep an open mind then I think you can really experience something special.<br /><br />Much has been made of New Zealand's 16 year old Ella Yelich-O'Connor's skyrocket ascension into the top of the charts--but when it comes right down to it--all I'm concerned about is whether she delivers. And I think she does--not in the way I was expecting, but in a way that makes me incredibly excited about her future and solidifies her as more than a one trick pony in my book. Lyrically Ella is both wise beyond her years as well as still a teenager, constantly walking a tricky balance of keen life observations mixed with insecurity and idealism.<br /><br />This album is extremely cohesive both thematically and musically, relying on minimal electronic pulses and a bass line that that grounds the entire album but never takes the forefront. This enables Ella to basically do whatever she feels like with the melody and use her own voice in layers and loops to become another instrument. Ella stays comfortably in her hypnotic lower register for the most part and paired with the stark and aloof beats makes this album sound different from every mainstream young pop starlet.<br /><br />But unfortunately, it means a few songs towards the middle all sound similar by lacking either a buildup or any special sound to really differentiate them. The album is essentially front and back loaded though with \\"Tennis Court\\", \\"Royals\\", \\"White Teeth Teens\\", and \\"A World Alone\\" being the must have tracks. The middle contains some growers like \\"Team\\", but the rest will have you pressing the skip button unless you just so happen to really connect to the lyrics.<br /><br />That said, Ella's fearlessness in creating an album that is just so out there is commendable and pays off when she gets everything lined up perfectly. The fact that she was discovered when she was 12 by a major label actually makes me appreciate even more just how hard she must have had to fight to write her own songs (which she does) and craft an album that is all her. Her best moments scream volumes of what she's capable of in the future, and I know that I'll be along for the ride.<br /><br />Ella doesn't sound that similar to any of these artists but I bet if you enjoy artists like Charli XCX, London Grammar, BANKS, Earl Sweatshirt (in attitude), Fiona Apple, Ruby Frost, or even Bipolar Sunshine that you'll at least enjoy the standout tracks here. Think lovechild between Lana Del Rey and Kanye.skip button unless you just so happen to really connect to the lyrics.<br /><br />That said, Ella's fearlessness in creating an album that is just so out there is commendable and pays off when she gets everything lined up perfectly.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun game very addictive. Hard to get extras though. Of course the in game currency is not worth buying in my book. But 4 stars for the fun.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I bought this movie a while ago for her birthday and she has watched it several times over the last year.  I am not usually into the movies that she watches, but this movie was an interesting story (based on a true story) about two different times (when Julia was younger and modern day Julie) and Julie's commitment to cook her way through Julia Child's cook book.
B00ECLTYOG|1.0|Worst of the Hangover's. No clue what they were thinking when they did this one. It had no funny moments in it. A waste of money to watch.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I have not used the software or USB hook up as this is not what I bought it for, I may update my review if I ever do use those features. However I did use it in conjunction with my Sony Receiver and it was amazing! Quiet operation, easy to setup, packaged very well and sounds just incredible. My only complaint, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, is that the RCA cables are attached to the unit and pretty short. I would have liked just RCA jacks so that I may hook up my own quality and length cables. So if this unit was going to be say more than 2 feet from the receiver you may want to consider an extension cable. Overall I am very happy and would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality fully automatic turntable in the $80 to $150 price range.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a fascinating look at time travel, and in depth at both the assassination of JFK and the early 60s in Texas.  It is brilliant at how thoroughly detailed King has crafted once again is mesmerizing.  As always, a brilliantly crafted story.
1400052181|5.0|I'm only half way through this book and I'm enthralled.  It's an amazing story; very well written.  It was recommended to me by several people, all of whom raved about it.  One of those you can' t put down.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I really like this game very addictive but fun. It's a very fast pace game, I know you will like as much as do.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|I bought this product about a year ago, using it in conjunction with an MP3 player in my car. It boosted the signal just enough to get the music to an enjoyable level, however in the last month it started cutting in and out in rhythmic intervals. I switched the wires and it was good, but recently it would buzz for most of the songs. That's when I came to the conclusion that this thing is probably dead. I know it has to be the amp because the MP3 player is fine when plugged in by itself, just not as loud. I'd say 1 year is a good run especially considering it's been in my car through a cold winter and hot summer, but then again I'd expect anything as basic as this which just performs one function to stand at least 3 years.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I think the graffics aren't that great but for a free game it'll do. I'm also not to fond of the energy level in this game. I don't think we should have one.
078881172X|5.0|You have no idea how happy I am that i was able to find this VHS and IT was IN MINT CONDITION! my daughter whom i s3 LOVES this movie and I thought a VHS would be better than a DVD because a VHS can lats for years! WONDERFUL SELLER THANK YOU!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is great!! I just could not stop reading it and was sad when it was over<br /><br />Great book.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted. it's a nice slim collection of all 8 movies, I honestly haven't watched them all yet but the ones I have have been perfect quality.
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|The dice appear to be driven off a pre-seeded prng, since you can undo multiple rolls and then get exactly the same rolls again. That isn't technically buggy and they can legitimately claim to get a flat distribution over time, but it means players can cheat and therefore so can the computer.<br /><br />Secondly, the AI is defective. It's even worse than one I would write! That really REALLY needs fixing. Badly. It seems to have a lookahead of zero and a penchant for stacking everything on the last space. Either write a better AI (herustics, not fixed moves) or let it write its own (genetic algorithms).
1476733953|1.0|I started to read this book based on all of the reviews and the amount of reviews this book has.  I couldn't even get through half of this book and I usually never stop reading a book until the end.  The story was so boring and I found myself staring at the same page for awhile.  I read a lot of books and I couldn't get myself to finish this book.  I'm quite surprised with all of the positive reviews.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Watch out. After you watch this season, you're hooked and the only cure is season 2, then seaosn 3 and so on....
B007JCP8FE|5.0|This is one of their best albums yet! Right off the start, they hit you with the fast paced song &#34;Adrenaline&#34; and you just know the album is going to be great! My 2 favorite songs right now are &#34;For My Sake&#34; and &#34;My Name&#34;. While &#34;I'll Follow You&#34; is a close third. You can't miss with this album. If you like Shinedown, you will LOVE this album!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Great graphics and action. Almost like playing classic arcade machines in the good ole days. Hope they continue to publish more of these classic games for all kinds of people to enjoy.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|An absolute monster of a movie to end the trilogy. Nolan and his crew definitely brought the batman character back to life with the 3 movies. Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Kinda addicting, lots of fun with the minion Dave and all of his costumes. Fun for everyone, although its too hard to get tokens.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|It still brings me to tears, but what really surprised me was that it brought my 6 year old grandson to tears. He was so touched by the movie.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game! I've always had a &quot;thing &quot; for numbers, and this game was created for me. Granted the pictures are a little lame, it's still a great game.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great logic puzzles!<br />.<br />Use logic to fill in the grids.  Choose your difficulty level by picking the grid size.<br />I can't seem to put it down once I get started - I love it!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|The songs are pretty and the music is beautiful.  Can't go wrong if you enjoy beautiful ballads and a actual singer that you can understand what they are singing.
B00B5QGPZC|5.0|If you have not heard David Garrett, buy this immediately--you'll love it.  He mixes Classical with Contemporary in his own unique style.  Every track is A-1
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed this game--very engaging and entertaining. If you like puzzles and mysteries,you will enjoy it. Looking forward to more levels.
B00499NHLC|5.0|There is &#34;One&#34; inescapable and inexcusable flaw in this new series... they only made three. (season one)<br /><br />This is pretty much what Arthur would have come up with - if he had been born a century and a half later.<br />Sherlock is as obnoxious, tedious, fastidious as ever.<br />Watson is forever trying to keep up.<br />The criminals are all up to the task.<br />The police are as bewildered as always.<br />The brother is still the brother.<br /><br />It all works well... credibly updated to today's headlines, with today's technology.<br /><br />The CBS Sherlock &#34;Elementary&#34; suffers from &#34;one&#34; inescapable and inexcusable flaw... They made more than one.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Well I like kik it's fun and entertaining but....I logged out and now when I try to log back into it it says that the login progress is to slow. EVERYTIME! Down anyone know how to help??
B00F875N98|3.0|If you're a die hard KOL fan like me, the album is a must.  Don't expect much.  Supersoaker is a great song but overall, the album just won't meet your expectations.  Songwriting is what went so wrong with this release.  That great sound that you know and love is still there but the lyrics will make you shake your head at times.  Just plain weak in that category.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Loved the storyline. Loved Ellis & the childhood lesson he learned about love, the law, loss & trust. Which emulated Muds life of love & loss & trusting somebody for a cause. Mathew Mchonahey great at anything from a suit to ragged jeans & a lucky shirt. A smartellic but well grounded. He can't play a bad part. Always loved him.Hope to see more of Neckbone & Ellis.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Could not put it down<br />Great read!  A very touching story.  Beautifully written.  Sad that the story is over.  Now I have to find a new book
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|Be prepared to be inspired and to cry. The Australian author of this book based it upon his father's own experience as one of Weary Dunlop's 1000 prisoners of war. He was able to verify his work with him right up to the day of finishing writing this novel; the same day his father died at age 98. A moving book which contrasts the good and bad in the human spirit.
B00AOMR2S2|3.0|It's the songs of the movie but not from the movie. Nice, but lacks the connection with the scenes that we liked the most.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I've been watching TGW since it started.  It keeps getting better and better each season and each episode - love it
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|It would have been nicer if the story was written with more emotion. It read like a dry journal article.
B004GYY714|5.0|Radio is my favorite of all media.  So when Tunein Radio came around with the ability to still make me feel &#34;plugged into&#34; the two markets where I split most of my time, through my favorite radio stations in those markets, I was hooked.  Also, the quality of transmission to date has been clear and consistent with limited buffering.  My experience has been very positive to date.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|There is a part in there that chilled my bones when it showed how the prisoner got sent to the gulag without knowing where he was going but was suddenly hinted to watch his every move.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Baz Luhrman made the enduring Gatsby story into a spectacle, and you can't separate this movie from Luhrman's genius for visual and musical extravagance. DeCaprio played Robert Redford really well . . . uh, no, I mean he played Gatsby okay. Carey Mulligan was outstanding as Daisy. Worth watching on Amazon, but it was best on the big screen, where it probably won't ever be again.
B00B999E12|5.0|SAW IN THEATRE 4 TIMES...BOUGHT THE DVD, PLUS THE FILM CD...AND HAVE IT \\"ON DEMAND\\" A MOVING FILM TO SAY THE LEAST...THANKS TO AMAZON.COM FOR PROVIDING...
0765325950|3.0|First off, I've enjoyed the series.  For the most part, it was well written.  There were some things I disagreed with (*cough* JR's sexist treatment of women *cough*)(*cough the striking resemblance to LOTR - there's even a pit of DOOM *cough*), but for the most part it's an interesting ride.<br /><br />I've also enjoyed Sanderson's mistborn series.<br /><br />Harriet had...a difficult choice.  I think she did the best with what she had.  Sanderson is not a perfect fill for RJ's shoes but then, who would be?<br /><br />But.  (SPOILERS)<br /><br />I feel the same way about the final three books, especially this one, that I felt about the movie A.I.  The transition from RJ to BS is...jarring.<br /><br />I also learned all sorts of added Things Not To Do When You're Writing A Novel, such as don't build up one of the one-of-us-normals-who-came-to-prominence-and-showed-you-don't-have-to-be-destined-to-be-amazing characters over numerous books as being the character that will stick around for centuries to come only to kill her for an \\"eh\\" pithy plot twist moment that falls flat. Or foreshadow throughout the Entire. Frickin'. Series. that a character's fate is to die, only to save him at the last moment through trickery (while, of course, killing off the character outlined above) with little to no explanation as to WHY and in a way that is confusing and trails off to...nothing.<br /><br />The author in me is itching to write a fanfic alternate to this final book to fix these and other issues.  As grand a series as WoT should go out with a resounding bang, not a whimper.  And while there were some moments of interesting night flowers (to use a term from the books), the finale was....eh.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This version keeps me entertained for hours!<br />I recently got Minecraft for Xbox 360 and I like it better than this.<br />But still a good game!
B00CTGVKGQ|5.0|LOVE this EP!!!  Lorde is one of my new favorite singers.<br /><br />really bummed that love club and bravado did not make the full length album, but at least i have them on this WIKED ep!!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Love it. Interesting to watch. Not a lawyer, so not sure how realistic it is but still very entertaining.  See for yourself.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Ditto with a big smile!!! Loved every word & wished it not to end.  Alas!!! Will be waiting for more!!!
B00594XOZU|2.0|I've had Kik for a while. For some odd reason it won't let me log in now! I've tried shutting down my kindle, deleting the app, and pretty Mich every thing else. I know my password is correct because I can log in on my iPhone and iPad. It was a good app before, but now it's basically useless.
B009LDD5E0|4.0|This season is a bit of a departure from 1 thru 3 because many regulars becomes more guest starring roles, but I still abosolutely loved this season. The new characters take time to grow on you, but there's potential there. As for the oldies, watching Rachel, Kurt and Santana in New York is my dream version of glee. Here's hoping season 5 is more NYC focused. Despite that though, I DO enjoy seeing characters in Ohio like Blaine, Tina and Sam get more defined stories that help you get to know them as people. Finn really starts coming into his own in this season too, becoming more of a teacher figure. It's heartbreaking to know that won't come to a close happily because of Cory's death, but I have total faith he won't be forgotten in the future. So over all, I really loved this season and in my opinion, it's an improvement over a lot of season 3, especially the second half. Favorite episodes include The Break Up, Dynamic Duets, Swan Song, I Do, Naked, Shooting Star and Wonder-ful. This is great, classic glee in many instances. Check it out.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is super addicting. Not only do I love it, but both of the kids love it as well!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|It's so good it doesn't even feel like you're reading a pdf file. It's so readable it feels like a word doc.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This is a worthy finale to the Iron Man movies.  It effectively shows the growth of Tony without giving up anything in action or the irreverent attitude that has made these movies.  This is really the best of the 3 movies, and that says a lot.  This is a great movie for anyone.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|the search is very user friendly and the program works well. at first i was skeptic but then I got to like it a lot.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|My wife and I stumbled across this show late one night on FX. We got so hooked by the first episode we watched the next 4. (It was a  marathon airing.)<br /><br />The next day we purchased the series to watch it in it's entirety.<br /><br />The characters and story line are great.<br /><br />I also like that each &#34;American Horror Story&#34; season is something new. Asylum's story line is started and finished in one season.<br /><br />If you like creepy and dark, check this out.
B000SEFCD8|4.0|There is a great deal of wisdom in this book, it's not a 'do this to get your pooch to do that' guide for basic obedience but it makes clear how humans by nature tend to communicate and how dogs do and, where there is a gap, how to bridge it more effectively to help your dog understand what you need from him or her. And it really helps achieve greater obedience.<br /><br />Case in point, how do you call your dog to come?  She writes, think like a dog and get the dog to chase you to come. Call out 'come' over your shoulder in a playful voice as you move away in the direction you want the dog to come - i.e. toward you.<br /><br />Crazy? No. It worked under heart-stopping circumstances.<br /><br />After having my new stray adoptee a week, he escaped an old cedar fence in the backyard and ran off in search of rabbits. He crossed several streets as I pursued him puffing and screaming 'Come, Anchovy, come!\\" When I finally got near him, he was halfway up a cement stairway one block from a busy, four-lane street beyond which beckoned a huge public park (larger than Central Park in NYC). He stood poised to run away and I stopped, turned away against all my instincts and chirped \\"Come Anchovy\\" in a high pitched voice and starting jogging away from him.<br /><br />He raced to catch me, tail wagging, body wiggling, wondering what it was I was going to show him. A HUGE RELIEF. Then I hugged him under his tummy up, not over his back, a primate thing dogs tolerate, and I rubbed his chest, a dog thing primates don't think to do that they love.<br /><br />There were many more insights of practical use than that, but that tip alone may've saved my dog's life. It certainly reinforced that coming to me is a good, fun thing even when unexplored worlds are just a scamper away. I\\"ll be re-reading this from time to time to remind myself of more dog wisdom. I highly recommend this whether you've had dogs for years or are about to adopt your first. (There are lots of great training manuals out there, too.)<br /><br />All that said, I didn't love the depth to which she goes into primate behavior, it could've been summarized as key points without the loving detail from her doctoral thesis days IMO, however, having a better understanding of inborn human/dog differences, has made a big difference to me. I have made faster, more meaningful progress with a newly-adopted, former stray dog thanks to what I learned here.ut there, too.)<br /><br />All that said, I didn't love the depth to which she goes into primate behavior, it could've been summarized as key points without the loving detail from her doctoral thesis days IMO, however, having a better understanding of inborn human/dog differences, has made a big difference to me.

B003U6BE8I|4.0|I chose to watch this for my 9 year olds, but it was much better than I thought it would be!  Alot of well known actors in it, and it was filled with action - good movie!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story will have you in tears, both the good kind and the bad kind. I couldn't put this book down. I'm sad it is over, but this is one story that will stick with me forever.
B00640Z0RI|5.0|Captures the nightmarish, pyschedelic experience of the Viet Nam war. It is an unblinking look at the folly and the beauty of this conflict.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I really like this game and it was free!  Can't beat that.  Plays very fast and well.  I like that you can do single player against the computer.
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|This is a great album!  I was excited to hear that Alan Jackson had done a Bluegrass Album.  I love his slowed-down version of Blue Moon of Kentucky.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you enjoy a great fun exciting game of bingo then bingo blitz is for you. Lots of action and fun bingo rooms.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great movie, full of suspense and excitement. I have issues with the original idea and how these zombies can detect disease so fast, but the movie I liked and is well made
B00F35BV64|3.0|I didn't quite buy the characters. They were all just a little bit off. I don't mean they had to match the originals exactly. But since that's what they basically tried to do, none of them really pulled it off. Not a bad effort though. It was still an entertaining film.
B008Y212PI|5.0|love this game!  this type of game is new to me.  I was not going to buy because I did not think I would understand it.  it is very easy and I'm glad I purchased
B009RX8MQ0|4.0|This is definitely a soap opera that just happens to be shown at night. It isn't much different than say, Days of Our Lives, but I enjoy it's overdramatic moments just for the laugh factor. The guy who plays Nolan is especially awful, but acting ability doesn't seem to be a requirement on many t.v. shows, does it? (I mean, he whisper/growls his lines just like John Black on \\"Days\\"). Season one was definitely better than season two, but there are enough fun things going on that I still plan to watch season three. (I DO hope they get some new/better writers, however). For me, the best things about \\"Revenge\\" are Victoria's snotty speeches and the hot guys on the show. (As for Declan, he's a cute little guy who looks like he's still in junior high, and his girlfriend Charlotte is bigger than he is! That is the show's only mistake with the male casting, I think). If you enjoy a good, if melodramatic storyline full of secret plots, murder, illegitimate children, corporate espionage, comas, false identities, surprise relatives, political backstabbing, and of course, REVENGE then this is the show for you!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Good visual effects, childish dialogue and character development, underdeveloped plot. The movie starts interestingly but then quickly looses steam as one silly sequence follows another. A pity for Brad Pitt, he can surely do better than that.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Crazy, Stupid Love is one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies I have ever seen! I have watched it over and over (and I don't normally do that). I told my sisters about it, and we all watched it together, laughing our heads off and relating to the whole thing. (And of course we all murmured a collective \\"OOooooo\\" when Ryan Gosling took off his shirt!) The dialogue is just clever without trying to be too cute or hip, and both Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling put in a stellar performance. If I had one tiny complaint, it would be that there is a bit too much of the \\"babysitter\\" plot going on. Perhaps the people who gave this movie negative reviews don't enjoy witty dialogue, fast pacing, sexy abs, and the characters being put in hilariously awkward situations? Maybe they should take their grumpy selves somewhere quiet and read some Nietzsche.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Just started with easy sets but fine it fun.  Makes you think.  Granddaughters will love it.  Wish the highlights could be different colors.
B00991TCOG|4.0|I heard this artist on pandora radio when i was studying one night.  She is very talented.  I really enjoy the CD and so does my mom!
B005K17RU0|5.0|If you are planning a little walk around the lake or a cookout for 40 people check with accuweather first. When my 80 year old mother decided to tackle her bucket list by taking the two mile, very hilly, walk around the lake at my house we should have checked accuwether. It was a lovely morning when  we left. But as so often happens when you live near the ocean,  a breeze kicked up, clouds rolled in, and well it's a good thing she could laugh about it because yikes we got soaked!!  Now I've learned my lesson and before makeing outdoor plans I hit the accuweather app first. After all I'm certain I could not have squeazed fourty people into our little house lol. Thank You AccuWeather.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Item as described, this is a must have cd collection, grab it before its gone and you cant ever get your hands on one!!!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Super good season, a little disappointed in the ending but that's television for ya! Recommend this to everyone! Hope you enjoy it!
0380018179|4.0|It's good
B008Y212PI|4.0|Really makes you think on some of the puzzles. Cool scenes. Might have to get more games from this developer.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book gets the wheels turning on how you can take control of your life by having some faith in the universe. I liked it!
B008Y212PI|3.0|I enjoy playing this game, but it feels like it was designed in 2010.  If logic puzzles entertain you, you'll like this game.  The graphics aren't bad enough to keep me from playing.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|fun, easy..I like it. It works like a game should. I would recommend it to others.....I like their other games as well.
B00594XOZU|2.0|An error message keeps popping up every time I try to log in &amp;&amp; I would love for it ti be fixed because there is nothing wrong with my kindle or internet connection '
B009A9EPLM|4.0|I totally enjoy the music of John Williams.  The music from the movie brought back scenes of the film.  I love playing it every so often.  May I put in a plug for MovieMars who shipped it.  They are a great company to deal with and will continue to use them.  Thank you.
B00632HWOG|5.0|YAHOO! Mail is my 1st choice in internet mail service.<br />My previous e-mail addresses with cable companies changed as I changed services.  Decided to have one e-mail address that wouldn't change and YAHOO! Mail fit the bill.
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|This was a great purchase and was excited about the physical purchase and the online version.  But,...sorry, there was a glitch.  I tried making a download version to my IPhone and wasn't able to make that link.  I liked that I purchased the online version with Amazon.  This was a first time purchase of a movie that I could stream on my laptop.  I would like a permanent copy to my library for my &#34;Media Center&#34;.  I am still igornant about possibly downloading to that option.  Until then, I will enjoy interfacing with Amazon.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|After Sectors 1-3 I was wishing there would be a Sector 4, especially with Rush's new found respect. When I head these albums would be remastered for digital I new the wish was coming true. However, it got better...the box set is not only a remastering of the Atlantic era but also would include Vapor Trails Remixed. Awesome! And I mean it. Fist of all, Presto and Roll the Bones needed remastering badly as you could not shuffle your Rush collection with these two. They sounded very thin and quiet. The good news is the remastering did not take away from what is good from these two albums but brought up the volume and definition. Worth the $39 just for that. The VT Remix is more than just a bonus, it is like having a new Rush album. You can read all the glowing reviews on Amazon already but for me the songs are finally given their proper mix and clarity. The album is just amazing and meaningful for the significance it holds to Rush's history. Now true justice has been done and a larger audience can rediscover this hidden gem. Oh yeah, Counterparts is a masterpiece too (for the modern Rush era).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I is the best game ever you can do a lot of stuff in it mind is the unscientific j
B00F3YHMUE|5.0|Sting is not one but several very talented people all wrapped in one. This is about as far removed from Sting's Police days as its possible to get but it is nevertheless a beautiful jazzy themed suite of songs about Sting's origins in Tyneside in the UK when great ships were still being made there and the world was a much simpler and happier place. If you've ever loved this man's work, you will love this!
B007DIQC90|5.0|This CD is of folky type music.  When it first came out, I knew and liked about 2 songs on it.  Since then, my 18 month old fell in LOVE with one of the songs so we got her this cd to play in her room on repeat.  Since we listen to it all day every day, whenever we are in her room over about a week, you realize that you hear all the songs and you start to recognize them.  This is when we began to realize that the WHOLE cd was our favorite.  I also like that there is no curse words in it that we can hear.  So I don't have to worry about her picking up on those words.  I would recommend this to anyone of ALL ages!!!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|The item was shipped very fast.  I ordered this for a friend and she is very happy with the product.  It was exactly as described and in new condition.
1449437524|5.0|The Oatmeal has a way with words. His stories are beautiful and his art is always delightful. This is a small book but I don't regret purchasing it at all. You likely won't either.<br /><br />Every peek into his world helps to brighten my own.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A wonderful book that everyone can take something from. I have a eBook version in addition to my hardcopy. I can't recommend it highly enough and have given it to many people over the years.
B009R659L8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and did not want to put it down. Mary Higgins Clark has always been one of my favorite authors.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|An Interesting speculative fiction about people living their lives in a computer simulation of the world, because the real world is a distopian hell hole. There is a contest hidden in the code of the world simulation that bestows fame, immense fortune, and ultimate control of the simulation. Everyone is hunting for the starting point of the contest, studying the smallest details of the life of the simulation's creator for clues.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like being able to change the look of the horses. a lot of fun playing with the horses. I'm 26 and love this game.
020530902X|5.0|I read this book and its packed with powerful information for beginning writers like myself. I would highly<br />recommend this book to my friends.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed readig it, as I always do with the series, but I found it was too long and inconclusive. Cannot wait for the next installment, though. The plot definitely thickens.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|complete waste of time..Useless book . i don't recommend it to any one. I am just trying to save your time :D
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was creative and very heartwarming.  I plan to read more of  this author's writing.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Lots of fun and some were pretty challenging.  I really like the part where you can double touch to help me know which tiles I can hit or not.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Once again, King keeps me reading long after I should have gone to sleep.  He takes us to see Danny Torrance in adulthood and shows us how how his life is.  He shows us the the 'shine' is something that 'people' are very willing and able to kill for........Unbelievably good and very realistic in the alcoholic stages.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|I use this movie for College Writing course.  It is a great way for students to learn analysis skills and critical &#34;reading&#34; skills.
B003BKZW7C|5.0|I had to buy this on Kindle because my paperback was falling apart.<br />King merges the past and the present in a way that keeps you reading and loving his world.  You can almost smell the summer in the Barrens.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|quite a good movie. had lots of action and kept you in the movie thru out. I am waiting for more to come out .
B005GQ5IA0|4.0|I found it very different to the Hollywood version.  Thank goodness!  I enjoyed learning how he thought and how he filled his days.  Of his learning.........
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Really enjoyed the bonus features!! The Marvel short film was great, as for the movie itself... Its Ironman! Not gonna win any awards, but an amazing movie nonetheless.
B00321GTJU|5.0|I just love watching the planet earth series, they have a large variety of plants, animals, and other fascinating places, always worth watching.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|This is one of my Boyfriends favorite movies! An oldie but a goodie!! And it is in HD!! Great Movie!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Being a Star Trek fan, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. Although it did seem to make some &#34;historical&#34; changes that makes the movies and the series that &#34;chronologically&#34; came after it not make sense in a few minor details.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use facebook on my laptop and I enjoy it on my kindle fire. I would recommend this app for anyone who uses facebook.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app very easy to use. My kids can even use it without any problems. I haven't had any problems with this app and it's been almost a year since I downloaded calculator plus.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Don't miss this sequel to the Shining.  Little Danny Torrance is all grown up.  Stephen King has been touted as the best Horror writer.  He is much more than that.  Get ready to fall in love with his good characters, hate the bad ones and be very sad when the book ends...it is one that I did not want to end.  Very well done and I highly recommend!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game play it very day, keeps you thinking as the games change the more you play the game, would recommend it so much fun
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing has revolutionized the way we watch TV. Though my computer can be directly connected to the TV, this allows me to use my computer while we watch Netflix. We use my Nexus 7 and our iPhones to control it and it functions incredibly well. It will be even better as they add functionality. We don't even have cable TV because this is all we need.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would not recommend this to children under 16 years of age.  It is very violent.  On the other hand, the storyline is infectious.  I catch myself holding my breath through most of the show.  Definitely worth it.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|My Kindle has stopped working. It won't take a charge; I have tried 2 different chargers. The chargers work on my husband's Kindle, so I know they aren't the problem. At first the Battery Doctor seemed to help, but after using it only 3 times it didn't do any good. My Kindle is only 20 months old, and I feel very frustrated. It was a birthday gift from my family in February, 2012. I really miss it and don't know what to do with it.
1781162646|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book. Not spooky. A good, solid, incredibly entertaining work of fiction. A 60-ish man looking back on the summer of his 21st year. A coming of age book about a kid, as told by his wiser, older self. A book about characters you come to know and care about about. A book that makes you smile... and cry. 5 friggin' stars.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|I didn't get to use this app because my Kindle won't take or hold a charge. I don't know what is wrong with it.
B00E9P959O|5.0|When this album came out originally I remember liking the songs but actually feeling fatigued listening to them because they were just so muddy. I realized just how bad the mix was during their next concert - the songs sounded so much better live.<br /><br />Well with the new remix the mud is gone! In just the first track \\"one Little Victory\\"  I've already heard a bass line completely obscured before.<br /><br />But the biggest treat is Geddy's vocals. They are SO MUCH clearer now that they don't have to compete with guitar, bass, and drums turned up to 11.<br /><br />This is definitely worth the re-buy. It's like getting a whole new Rush CD.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is lots of fun. At times it runs a little slow sometimes. Just wish you could get more coins without buying them.
B00DJZR4A2|2.0|I am a huge Elton John fan and have almost every one of his releases, and I really wanted this one to be good. The advance info on this was that it was more like his older, live stuff, with just a piano, bass and drums. (kind of like his live 11-17-70 album) This was nothing like that and I cannot think of a single track that stuck in my head. I have even waited a while to write this up, because most of the time, the second play of a record warms me up to it, but not this time.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book does a good job at examining introversion generally, particularly in it's value / stigma in U.S. culture. I consider myself to be introverted, but I supposed not &#34;pathologically&#34; introverted? I felt a lot of this book was targeted more towards readers who experience extreme introversion (and those that have loved-ones who experience life in this way.) While I didn't particularly identify with this, nor identify with the social stigmas and challenges associated with this, I was able to examine myself and better understand how I feel about my own introverted tendencies. More than anything else, this book opened my eyes to the ways U.S. culture values extroversion over introversion, and how I perceive myself in that context.
0385349947|1.0|I truly wanted to believe that I was going to learn something about the corporate world and women and their ambitions but it was just redundant, retelling of gender inequity issues from long ago that she tries to modernize, and just a bunch of nonsense.  I just can't believe that this book got the hype that it did and that Sheryl actually wrote this...she must have had some major input from her ghost writer(s). The statements made were just too elementary, too sappy and way too superficial.
B007NZQU72|3.0|I consider myself to be a person who is sensitive to stimulation in my environment. I can't say I felt that much of this book applied to me. Perhaps I'm not sensitive ENOUGH? &#34;Highly Sensitive Person&#34; seems to me to be a description of a &#34;syndrome&#34; rather than something that is clearly identifiable and definable. There's definitely some interesting stuff in this book that I could relate to, but not enough here for me to feel I fit into a singular definition such as this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy enough to progress through the game but challenging enough to still be fun. Makes for a win - win game.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|One of THE best vampire movies ever!  Loved it!  In the top 100 list of Horror Movies!  I highly recommend it:)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is truly stunning. Witty, and sad at the same time, this coming of age novel should be read by teens all over the globe.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|For a free game it's apt of fun and there's not much of a need to spend real money on it. My kids love . It
B008Y212PI|5.0|Wonderful game very addictive .can't wait to start new levels  highly recommend very relaxing after long day. great detail love  the puzzle pictures
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a huge Stephen King fan, I admit it. Can't wait to get my hands on anything and everything he writes. And, as I expected, I enjoyed the crap out of this book.  Great ending, great beginning, great middle too.  Get it.  Read it.  Enjoy.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I began to lose my hearing some years ago. My deepest pain comes from the lack of fidelity when I listen to music.<br /><br />I'll leave all the technical explanations to the previous and soon to be released reviews about the remix. I like VT, but never considered the mix that much since I had always had a hard time with hearing. However I've found that I can distinguish a difference between this mix and the original.<br /><br />It's a wonderful remix and think it's worth the extra effort to buy and listen to.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The first 250 pages of this book were quiet confusing. Took way too long to get into. About 150 pages left is when I was interested in the book. Took too long!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it! It's not necessary, but it wouldn't hurt to read The Shining before opening this. Thu  is another book I had a hard time putting down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked this book because this is when the rebellion starts and I think katniss is really more grown-up in this book.
B00E9P959O|5.0|This was always one of my Favs from RUSH, along with Caress and Grace, the obscure enchant me. So when they talked about not liking the mix of Vapor Trails I didn't understand, I am not a casual RUSH fan, I love em. But I am not a sound aficionado, so the feeling of this record is what moved me, the words written are beautiful, and they didn't change. I can hear the difference, and they did great job re-mixing it, I love it more now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has everything I like in horse games! It is on  of the best games I have ever played and my five year old little sister LOVES this game.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I am one of those people who has always thought the material on Vapor Trails was excellent it was just plagued by some horrible production work and boy does this remix prove my point!<br /><br />What David Bottrill has done with this album is nothing short of genius.<br />He has brought to life an album which was previously just a wall of sonic noise.<br /><br />Be warned though, this remix brings us many changes to the songs we all know well. Bottrill took all the original tracks and brought out the best in each one. Everything was in the original recordings, but because of how it was mixed before a lot of what we're hearing now was buried.<br /><br />From the guitar solos in OLV and Ceiling Unlimited to using different vocal tracks as the main focus Bottrill truly takes the best of each song while still keeping all the original arrangements.<br /><br />Vapor Trails Remixed is wonderful. If you love the album but hate the original muddy mess do yourself a favor and buy this now! You wont regret it!
B008Y212PI|5.0|What a fun game! This is the first I have heard of this type of game and I know it will not be my last since I am enjoying this one so much.
B000IZ8SD8|3.0|but still fun to watch.  I didn't feel sorry that I watched it, and it mostly held my attention.  OK to pass the time.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I can easily say Shadow of the Colossus is one of my favorite games of all time.  The gameplay revolves around 16 \\"boss battles.\\"  There are no random enemy encounters.  You get a real sense of isolation as your character named Wander and his trusty horse Agro venture off into deserted lands to capture colossus essence.  This game serves as a prequel to Ico, as you will see elements from each game wrapped into one another.<br /><br />Ico is also an amazing game. It's similar in art style and direction.  The puzzles are complex enough without being overly difficult to solve.  The bond between your character and Yorda is amazing considering Ico rarely speaks and Yorda's foriegn language is not translated.<br /><br />I'm being vague on purpose as I don't want to ruin these games, which makes writing a \\"review\\" hard.  These games have inspired countless others since their inception (read their respective wikipedia pages).  I can't recommend these enough.  A must own.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Comparied to all other Vince Flynn books this one is tied with all the rest for the best.  An excellent read that starts on page 1.
B001E75QH0|3.0|a good price to stroll down memory lane. I was never a huge Indiana Jones fan, but for the price it was nice revisiting these stories.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Didn't think this was for me but as other reviewers have said this game is very fun and addictive.  Would highly recommend.  Thanks Amazon awesome faotd
B00ECUARO8|5.0|All and all this was a great film. the story was solid, well-told, and nicely directed. My husband whom is overly critical of films enjoyed it as well.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  I wish I had waited til it was available free through my Amazon Prime though.  I would have saved some money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love love love! Only took a day to read because I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading the next . One
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I watch this movie year-round, it is one of my all-time favorites. I actually bought it for my brothers birthday and received it in 2 days because of Amazon Prime, so that was a plus.
B002ZTIIXK|4.0|love her
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  At first it was hard to keep all the characters straight because the first few chapters introduced a number of people whose lives would cross by the end of the book.  I made a reference card and that helped me keep track of them.  I hated for the book to end.
1557427283|4.0|Okay book.
B000WXVJ6Y|5.0|Gwen Stefani comes around the curve of pop music again with a different added flair this time, a rap hip-hoppish sorta dimension. My favorite song off it, Yummy, is amazing with a lot of conversation and a sonic blaring beat with phone noises, a bit similar to Whatcha Waiting For, her best song off L.A.M.B. WInd It Up keeps your attention and it has an excellent sound to it. It's funny too. Orange County Girl is explicit and nice, as is don't get it twisted. Overall, INCREDIBLE!!!!!
B00E9P959O|5.0|So, one reviewer stated that the first VT release was a \\"wall of...noise\\"; that's exactly how I have been describing it to myself since it's debut.  Over the years I've tried to listen to it but couldn't; there was just too much muddiness for me to enjoy it.  I was so disappointed with the mixing that I really never listened to any song more than twice (with the exception of Vapor Trails and Earthshine).  I knew there was classic RUSH behind that wall of sound, but just couldn't make out the individual parts well enough to enjoy the music.  This remix changes all of that.<br /><br />While I don't have the CD in my hands as of yet, I did start listening to the mp3 version you get with this purchase and I can say I'm starting to enjoy it much more.  I'm so glad they released this version as, for me, the first release is a sore spot in an otherwise astounding body of work. While I can't hold this album up to the standards of Moving Pictures, 2112, or even the new Clockwork Angels, I can now look at it next to the other albums without cringing.  So far, from the few songs I've heard, I can tell that VT will finally get more real estate in my playlists.<br /><br />My star rating does not reflect my true feelings for this album, but an overall feeling for RUSH.  The album is more in the 3.8 star range for me, but in my heart of hearts, I could never give RUSH anything lower than the 5 stars for the joy they've brought me throughout my life thus far.  Their music just resonates with my inner harmonies and dischords.  So while VT never really sat well with me musically, it's still a product of my favorite band.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have loved watching all seasons of Downtown Abbey, despite jumping on the bandwagon later than most have.  It has made us a fan of British productions and seems to have a purity to the art that is acting and cinematography. We plan to go back and watch many more British Masterpiece Theatre productions
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great ap has lots of different verisons of the Bible. Saves your place from where it was last read. Can get to a book, or verse easily. Easy to use.  Have had it for over 6 months, it works great everytime I use it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've always adored Stephen King's books, and this one made me anxiously rushing through the pages as well. The Shinning stands apart all his novels, so as Doctor Sleep.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Does a great job! I love you and have different color for different activites. Easy to use overall, I did try a few others and this one is easy to use.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wonderful story. Nothing like what I thought it would be was surprised how much I liked it. Recommend reading it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It took me forever to start watching Downton Abbey despite being highly recommended by friends and colleagues. I was blown away by the clever and sophisticated writing, as well as the superb acting by the whole cast. Among the best series I've watched so far.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I find the characters very engaging.  I feel as if I am finding out what is going on with people I know when I watch this show.  The actors are wonderful and the story is absorbing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game spending lots of brain power keeping me entertained.Would recommend to anyone..a great thinking game... love looking for the next clue
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I very much enjoyed this serious,<br />We have now finished the series and miss the lives we got so<br />interested it!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A great read. Beautifully developed characters  Couldn't put it down .  Highly recommend to those who enjoy the beauty and power of words to sculpt characters that are engaging, believeable and unforgetable.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm forced to write a review before I can move on to reading my next book. Such a waste of time!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Starts off simple enough but quickly progresses to images that are more difficult to decipher. Really fun to play with a group when you get stuck.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|couldn't stop laughing at this and can't wait to see Despicable Me II!  Recommended for all ages and everyone!  Loved it.
B001LF3YQK|2.0|I have a few things from skip hop which I really like, so I ordered the wipe dispenser too. I find it very big and bulky, much worse than to carry your pack of wipes in the diaper bag, so no advantage there. Then, I sometimes find it open in the diaper bag (the red dot slides easily when you  try to get something from the bag), which results in dried out wipes. Then, when you want to use it outside of the bag it's not as easy to get the wipes out with one hand as it should be, but that might be a general wipe dispenser problem...
B00340LM8C|4.0|A great story line, well written.  Actors of course are fabulous especially in an era that can't rely on CG.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What will I read now?!! This series was amazing. I can't wait for the movie and wonder how they will portray this on screen.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Really great books. I haven't finished the  entire set but so far I love it. Would definitely recommend these books.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Love it! Whatever mood you are in good or bad side! Gotta love it! Can't wait for what comes next!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have a nexus 10 and casting YouTube from it works great!  However, the Chrome browser on my nexus doesn't support casting.  That's kind of disappointing.  You'd think if they advertise &#34;can cast from Chrome&#34;, they'd cover all their bases... I am looking forward to the Chrome upgrade for tablets
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book very much and I'm going to continue reading the series until I have read them all.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Nothing good here: no humor, story, acting, twists in the plot... Just some zombies. Not even the music or scenery save the movie. Worst Brad Pitt move I can recall.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I love any type of hidden object games. This is one of the better ones that I have come across. It pays to check out some of the ones that other people have bought.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! I use it daily to help me relax and unwind after a long day. Give it a try and see for yourself it's free after all.
B005JR4K28|5.0|Ok,  I'm not saying that its perfect, but i still love this show and the characters.<br /><br />the  plot is sometimes a bit weak and confusing, like the writers couldn't figure out how to get from point A to point B, but they got to point B anyways.<br /><br />But Jess is the ultimate girl next door, and they all have such good chemistry together, i can believe that the guys have been friends for a long time in tv land.
B00F35BV64|4.0|This is one of the best  ST movies I have seen. The writers bring a lot of the past story lines together. The one major fault ( or maybe it was intentional) is that they &#34;borrow&#34; a lot of ideas from other movies. to the point that it is a spoof.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I have an acquaintance who also hiked this trail, writing in a moleskin book and drawing beautiful line<br />illustrations. Not that it was much better - as she never published, nor tried to do so.  BUT it gave me<br />a benchmark from which to look at this memoir - or novel based upon memories.<br /><br />Having also lost my Mother recently, lived and hiked in No CA, gave me reference points. I am not in<br />my 20's - but read hoping to find the feeling I got in &#34;Into the Wild'. I didn't, sadly....pushing myself through passages<br />and feeling some were written having narrative re-written.<br /><br />What profound feelings did she have?  And when along the way?  Did mountain vistas open her mind/heart?<br />She had a lot of healing to do - and seemed to have sabotaged herself (boots??????????) by such lack of preparation.<br />And when noted - and her feet, body was ravaged, why not contact Paul to, at least, get new boots, proper weight in<br />backpack?<br /><br />I believe we all push ourselves physically when it's important to heal outselves mentally/emotionally. This book is a good example. I took it to the northern woods of Michigan - where it's raw and unpopulated, to read - when I was scattering my own Mother's ashes.<br />So clearly I wanted to feel a kinship in the 'wild' of my experience.<br /><br />Ah, the fierceness and belief in oneself when young!  Saw that more than anything in this book. Read carefully, and will go back to see what I've missed. But perhaps I wanted it to be so much more - and feel it could have been.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Better than I thought it would be total surprise ,lots of action all the way till the end . Would love to watch again
B001NLKT60|5.0|Kept me enthralled the entire time. Didn't want it to end. STARTING THE THIRD ONE NOW!!  Review to follow soon.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was one of the most entertaining books I have read in a long time.  Although not a true story, the orphan train actually existed and the author did a lot of research so that the story is very believable.  I was very sad to finish it because I felt that I knew the characters and loved them.
B00008G7UJ|1.0|I ordered this for my 9th grade English class. As a Shakespeare fan, I was shocked at how crude the first scene was. Completely inappropriate for me to show 14 year olds. This one of the Bard's most beautiful plays and this movie ruins it. I couldn't watch any more of it and will be getting rid of it as quickly as possible. I wish I could return it, but it is obviously opened already. I only gave it one star because I was required to give it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The book for the most part was great. Loved almost every moment.....except the end. I wish she had ended on a more prevalent poignant note but she didn't. Sad the series is over!
B000VYX8PE|1.0|I hate it. My mom got me it for school and I hate it. I'd give it no stars once o ever if I could
0140177396|4.0|This was a great story. Although it is an older book, it seems almost timeless. I read this for school, and it far exceeded my expectations. I loved the relationship between George and Lennie; it was almost like they were siblings instead of friends. While I was initially happy that the book was short, I actually wish that it was longer so John Steinbeck could have developed these two great characters more. However, the few pages that we do get still do a great job of showing the challenges that they faced. The rest of the characters were just as interesting and I could have read more about them as well. The story was also very interesting. While it might seem a little generic, the characters make it very original. Above all, this was a great book and I highly recommend it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|On my second go around, and still need the hint button once in a while. Lots of different locations, different kinds of puzzles, and HO games. Can't wait for the next one!
B008JEJKKU|4.0|Shoes is very good, very practical, very cheap, I like very much, but a little big, I hope can visit again next time
B006LSZECO|3.0|It would have been best to punish Amy. It was a good read but the ending killed it fir me.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|i would recomend this app to any one who wants to build their own library.very easy to use,and user friendly
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Loved the book, it isn't Brandon Sanderson's best work, but even still i loved it, and Brandon Sandersons \\"not best work\\" is still far better than many other fantasy authors out there. He made a high bar for himself, but that isn't a reason to over judge all his other books.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|Install the app played it once and now it doesn't want to open.  Tried several different times and days to see if it would open. No luck.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Entertaining and characters with believable reactions.  An easy read for vacation and not to heavy.  Very enjoyable and pleasant.  Thanks
B008Y212PI|4.0|Good game, but need to leave a review to be able to unlock the bonus game.  This is my required review.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|this movie was great the protrayel by all the cast was just steller except for amy adams i tought she could of done better The non linear story line worked in this film The movie had very good attention to detial and had coverd everything it needed to cover by the films end most movies have major plot holes this had very little ones that could be forgivin. The movie was fun and enjoyable.  Now some people might not agree with everthing thats done in this movie. But i do think this movie was realistic exactly how the classic superman was the diffrence is now we live at diffrent times so this move might be grittier to older audiences. This Superman was the classic superman that me and my brothers admired as children. This movie was amazing and is the second best movie ive ever seen in my life
B000005AYL|3.0|I already knew and owned the cd version of the recording, so I did not feel compelled to read the reviews. However, as others have mentioned, the record is simply in a sleeve with a sticker. No record jacket with a spine that action can be seen when filed amongst other LP. Also, not the same track listing as provided. There are missing tracks and a radio edit.  Fair enough the music is fantastic and sounds great on vinyl, further more the price is low, but this listing is very misleading and does not give folks the opportunity to know what they are actually getting ahead of time..
B004YXE438|5.0|These puzzles should keep your brain in good condition.  You can start out slow and work your way up to more challenging puzzles which is what experts say should help you with dementia.  I think this is a win-win, you can have fun and hopefully protect yourself from some aging problems. The puzzles are all different and they are nice pictures.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Wonderful, heart wrenching book.. An extraordinary story of a remarkable woman, who, through no fault of her own, found herself herded off to be given away to anyone who would take her. Highly recommend.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well hey I love the game a lot<br /><br />Pros<br />Fun<br />You can play with your friends<br /><br />Cons<br />Kills battery fast<br />Updates are slow
B007MB5OCE|5.0|An amazing story! Hilarious to the bone. Can't wait to read the author's next book!<br />I guess we will be hearing more from this writer
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A nice distraction. It makes me laugh and there are no annoying life's for this game. That's what I like to do get on spend some time and pick up again later.
0425263908|3.0|The book was just okay.  Characters were interesting, story was interesting, but not a book that I couldn't wait to get bck to read.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book - but I almost wish that McGuire would have explored the characters more and extended it into a series rather than just a &#34;same story from a different point of view&#34;.  Great story regardless!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is awesome. You have to try it. One of the best games I have gotten as a free app of the day.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I freaking love this CD and I can't stop listening to it. I am hoping the next single will be One Phone Call.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|This is a Baz Luhrman movie so you can't go into it expecting anything to be normal.  His movies are always over the top, ex. Moulin Rouge.  So, by that standard, this lives up to expectations.  It has the grandness, the glitter, the music, the costumes.  Visually, it's a stunning movie.  Possibly that's why this movie fails in some respects.  The actors simply can't live up to the grand scale of the rest of the movie.  Dicaprio does make a fine Gatsby.  He gets the desperation and the ruthlessness perfectly.  And his good looks, while not a match for Redford, make him all the more irresistible.  Carey Mulligan looks the part of Daisy but can't quite pull off the careless little rich girl.  For one thing, she seems much too young and she doesn't have the hardness that Daisy must ultimately possess.  And, honestly, there just didn't seem to be any chemistry between the two stars.  The attraction seemed more superficial than obsessive and overpowering.  The biggest miss, character wise, was Tobey Maquire as Nick Carraway.  It just felt like he was reading someone else's story rather than telling his own.  The beginning of the movie felt completely awkward with his character, almost embarrassingly so.  From the time that Gatsby and Daisy meet, the movie does improve and rolls along pretty well for a while.  I guess I'm telling my age by saying that Robert Redford and Mia Farrow were the best Gatsby and Daisy ever but I don't care.  This one has a lot more flash than the older version but no real fire.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was great to see what happened to little Danny Torrance. It's hard not to wonder what would become of some characters. Danny was one if them.  Having enjoyed the Shining many years ago, it was great to hear from some of those characters and to meet new ones. I was pleased at how Dan turned out despite his problems.  I will never look at a big lumbering RV again the same way. Bravo, Mr. King.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it! My son couldn't get enough of it! It really kept his brain working.  I enjoyed it, too.
0385537670|5.0|Bought this book for myself, but once my daughter seen it she stole it. Now I don't hear no tv going in her room. I had to go check on her a couple of times to see if she was all right. She was fine; she was so engrossed in the book she didn't even know I was standing there.
B00846REIS|5.0|The characters are alive, the story exciting, this book is way better than 50 shades. Can't wait to read the 4th book in the series.
B008Y212PI|5.0|this app gets you thinking .it is so fun. if you like a challenge get this game. the puzzles are easy enough to keep you going but hard enough to catch your attention
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have 2 young children, and I work part-time ... yet I managed to finish this book in just a few days.  It's THAT good.  This is so much more than a sequel explaining what happened to Danny after The Overlook - it really is it's own book with it's own story and characters, including Danny, who basically is a new character now that he is an adult.  This is Stephen King as his best - the suspense starts building from the very start, and just before the halfway point, you realize you can't possibly put this book down until you finish it.
B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is great for connecting with both other Skype users and, for a very low annual fee, with persons via regular telephone numbers. Since it can use wireless Internet (as opposed to phone minutes or 3G/4G...), it can save phone minutes and hence money. And, video calls are cool too.
140006922X|5.0|Although it is almost unanimously agreed that, with the possible exception of Luke-Acts, the gospels were not written by the people for whom they are named.  An explanation of that statement alone, is enough I fear, to send a few people I know over the edge. If you are a Christian looking for a book about Jesus is God, Don't waist your time or money. If you hate all Muslims on the face of the earth, The author is a Muslim, Don't waist your time or money. If however, you have an open, balanced, ( and most important ) stable mind, are not easily threatened by difference, change or thinking outside the box, Read the book.  Zealot has completely changed the way I view Jesus of Nazareth forever. It is an extremely deep, thought provoking, soul searching book. Dr Aslan did an outstanding job. Five stars for two decades worth of research and effort.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Like rare old wine King continues to get better as the years roll along.  While The Shining was never one of my all-time King favorites it set the stage for a book I will definitely read again.  Danny and the rest of the characters in Dr. Sleep are so well crafted that we are naturally drawn to them.  I was constantly concerned about the possibility that one of these people would not make it.  King has never shied away from offing some of the people we come to know and love in his books.  I won't spoil it by saying whether everyone makes it out ok or not but I can say that King stays true with throwing a few good curves that no one was expecting.  After riding the high of Dr. Sleep for a week I now have to deal with the inevitable Between-King-books-blues.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|This is the first Ken Follet book I have read and I loved it.  He captures the mood and atmosphere of the pre - First World War Great Britain (and Europe) such to the degree that you are a living bystander to the momentous events that led to the first great conflagration of the world at global war.  The characters are richly defined and the reader is driven to the next in Follet's Trilogy!
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman's books are always just so magical.<br />As soon as I begin reading one of his books I am automatically transformed and transported<br />to where ever it is he wants to take me.<br />He is one of the authors I ALWAYS recommend to my friends!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|grout is soooo funny, and the 'experiments' are delved from age old 'as you thinketh' teachings, but still TRUE.  referred it to others.
B008Y212PI|5.0|great game with lots of chances to goof or to choose correctly.  will try others in the same family.  enjoy this game.
0452289963|5.0|Love this book, would recommend it!  I like that I can start any place in the book and begin reading, it's not necessarily one I'd read front to back.  It causes one to &#34;think&#34; outside the box, to delve into the inner self, to observe life from a different perspective.  Well written!
1401917232|5.0|Love Has Forgotten No One: The Answer to Life by Gary R. Renard is a book channeled from Ascended Masters Arten and Pursah. This book explains A Course in Miracles in a way that is easy to understand. One of the main lessons in this book is about true forgiveness as explained by the Ascended Masters and Gary in this book. The other lesson that is taught is that we are not separate from God. That we are separate from God is a perception of the ego.<br /><br />This is the first book by Gary Renard that I have read and I feel there is a lot of wisdom within. I really liked Love Has Forgotten No One and will defiantly read it again. The wisdom that can be found in this book is inspiring.  I loved the part where we are shown that we are perfect love and were never separate from God.<br /><br />Overall, I felt this book was well written and inspiring. I would recommend it to those who want to learn about A Course In Miracles. I will defiantly read this book again.<br /><br />I acknowledge that I received this book free of charge from Hay House in exchange for my unbiased review.

B009LQKHIO|3.0|Jill Sanders' FINDIN PRIDE is an excellent romance with characters who invoke sympathy with the reader.<br />Megan Kimble arrives in Pride, OR to attend her brother's funeral and claim her inheritance, but she discovers a world she has never encountered.<br />It is sad when one sees a good story flawed by grammatical errors too numerous to ignore. This title badly needs editing to make what is otherwise smooth prose not stop the reader in midcourse.<br />Good story, good read.<br />Nash Black, author of CARDS OF DEATH
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|5 Stars for the performance. The picture quality is not the best, but it was never meant to be high definition widescreen, etc. They don't make bands like this anymore. That being said Kings Of Leon are the closest I've seen. I'm not comparing their music, but the mentality. Kings Of Leon would have fit in perfectly with the 90's bands. Again, not the music. But, in terms of not selling out and being genuine. They also both had drug problems. They clearly didn't make music soley for fame, money, and girls.
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I loved everything about it. My favorite part, is the dialogue between the Mandarin and Tony. This movie really showed how Tony could get by without relying on high-tech gadgets and gizmos. I simply loved it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great American historical fiction about orphans in our country.  The story is about a current teenager in the foster care system and about a 90 year old that was an orphan when she was a child.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I have been a science fiction fan since I was small and there are certain sci-fi books and movies that are on my roster of all-time favorites (Matrix, Terminator movies, 2001, A Space Odyssey, Minority Report, Avatar, Doctor Who (I'm a Brit), Neil Gaiman, Asimov books, some Heinlein, Ender's Game are a few that come to mind) and Oblivion has joined the list.<br /><br />In my view, it's a highly aesthetic film with a good story and good acting. To me a movie like Oblivion is what movie making is about: good plot with a story you can't guess (not sure what the critics' comments about being derivative were about, I have read and seen plenty of sci-fi, and the story had me surprised), good CGI and effects, great, original accompanying music, good acting and some amazing, breathtaking scenes; like the protagonists' home in the sky and their swimming pool suspended amongst the clouds; the sweeping vistas of a post-apocalyptic earth (with a tip of the Empire State building showing) and flight scenes between Manhattan streets-turned ravines.<br /><br />Tom Cruise did a great job, he was believable and charismatic at the same time. The other actors, less well-known to me by name other than Morgan Freeman, acted their parts well and believably. Thanks to the Oblivion team for bringing a truly great science fiction movie to the screen.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I've always loved this type of logic game. My only complaint is that it could be a tad harder. Totally fun.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a heart warming story, that grabs the reader and sucks you in.  Wouldn't have missed this book for anything.  It's happy, sad, unfair, and a realm of emotions to take you to different places.  The ending is wonderful and completes the story.  What moral lessons to teach us as seen from a dogs perspective.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Crying now....*sigh. Amazing from beginning to end.  I could not put this book down.  Such an original metaphor for the continuity of the soul and perseverance through hard times.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This was a very suspenseful book with romance, mystery and gripping read.  I had trouble putting it down.  It gave an early look into Paris during war times and life's unfairness.  Would recommend this book to book clubs or anyone who would like a gripping story.
B000VDDWDS|4.0|Master and Commander is a marvelous film. It is extremely beautiful and in its slavish attention to the detail of life on an early nineteenth century British Navy vessel it is one of the most immersive movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Captain Aubrey and his crew aboard the H.M.S. Surprise as they attempt to track and destroy an enemy vessel, the superior French boat the Archeron.<br /><br />It is epic, but also intensely personal. For the entirety of the film we see only the events from the viewpoint of the members of the Surprise's crew. Director Peter Weir essentially enlists the audience in Britain's Navy for the two hour runtime. We are there with them for every moment, and like them, we cannot leave. The film feels almost documentary-like both for its intimate approach and for the amount of detail in day to day workings on the ship.<br /><br />There isn't any character development to speak of, but none is needed. We are seeing a \\"slice of life\\" so we don't need to see Aubrey overcome his near-compulsive oath to duty, nor any other such character revelations.<br /><br />The story is simple, but this movie is written more like a theatrical play where the spotlight is fully on the actors and their characters rather than piling melodramatic events to create an epic.<br /><br />Being confined to just one boat, and with not much more story than a long game of cat and mouse, however, can leave the film feeling slow at times. There were also a few scenes where the jump between scenes was rather awkward, making me feel like I missed something between the two, exactly like when you watch a movie edited for time on television.<br /><br />For an epic that doesn't try to blow it all out on spectacle and intense moments, but stays very realistic throughout and delivers very human characters, look no further than Master and Commander.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book grabs you from the first chapter.  The storyline keeps you guessing, and your heart goes out to the parents, how their lives were changed by this event.  Ending is quite a surprise, but keeps you coming back for more.  Not a book to be missed.

I live in Thailand and I see every day what that &#34;I'll see you in the next life&#34; does to folks thinking

B0071XO8RA|1.0|This was the worst book I ever read!!!  Don't go there.  What a waste of my time, don't know why it got good reviews!
0756404746|5.0|As a long time reader of fantasy books, this is one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It's a good middle ground between younger fantasy books (I.e. Eragon) but it lacks the overly detailed characteristics of a Tolkien tale (as an example.) I have, and will, continue to suggest this book and all that follow it to anyone who asks.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Copy from Netgalley.com<br /><br />Me Before You by Jojo Moyes<br /><br />What an amazing book! I could give this 100 stars! Books like this are why I love reading.  I could not put this book down! Louisa or Lou was so interesting, kind-hearted and a real person. Wil was full of complexities and even though at times he was a real jerk you could not help but fall in love with him and root for him.<br /><br />I loved how Lou transformed throughout the novel and how her and Wil's lives seemed to switch places-of sorts.  They were opposites but perfectly matched.<br /><br />Lou's family was also entertaining. The author really captured the little family quirks and she described the perfect family for Lou. I especially loved to see how her relationship with Treena evolved.<br /><br />Lou seemed to bring out the best in everyone, she even made Ms. & Mr. Traynor more likeable, there were no bad guys vs good guys, just very different people joined by one person-Wil.<br /><br />To me a fantastic book is one that you can't put down, the pages are numberless because you are a part of the story, and the characters are real-or your convinced they are.  I couldn't wait to see how it all ended but I was sad when it did.<br /><br />Moyes took a very delicate matter and gave it a name and a cast of characters to humanize the issue.  Incredibly well written and as the Brits say-brilliant!!
B009JZSFUY|5.0|I am a Trekkie and really love the TNG movies.  I especially love this one because of the personal conflict Picard must face in doing the greater good or getting revenge on the Borg.  It is a totally great watch!!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Reading each of the main characters I could see them acting out the way they did to situations that came up.  They came to live as Jill fashioned them with her words-I cheered the characters on as they emerged to develop.  Most of us go back home, but few get a chance to start over.  The abused xxxwere given a voice and the knight in shining armour dud show up! Hooray- love wins against overwhelming odds. Look forward to reading the next book about Pride.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Its good for those who watches  you tube and  Netflix.  I want to see my photos but I can not. I think its difficult or I don't know how to. But its not  even addressed any where if it could. wast of money looks like.Not for Apple users.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|The price was great and it fits my iphone snug.  I didn't use the screen protector but it was an added bonus.  It's not worth paying more than $5 or $6 for a case.

B00144VBBS|4.0|I know this two cd collection is called \\"35 BIGGEST Hits\\",but I still feel that there should have been some more songs,that needed to be included on this collection.Songs such as \\"Santa,I'm Right Here\\",\\"Tired\\",\\"When Love Fades\\",\\"High Matience Woman\\",\\"Crash Here Tonight\\" and \\"Love Me If You Can\\",needed to be on here.I also thought the new song,\\"She's A Hottie\\",was kinda crappy as well.But on the positive side,theres still alot of great songs on here,so thats why I am giving it a four out of five.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander, a renowned academic neurosurgeon, spent five decades years honing his scientific worldview.  His autobiographical book Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife (2012), describes his bacterial meningitis-induced coma in 2008, and the resulting transcendental Near-Death Experiences (NDE).  Prior to his NDE, he had a very scientific mindset, understood how the brain worked, and therefore thought the human mind was defined by, and existed within, the ~3 pounds of cranial matter between the ears.  He gave little credence to patients who reported NDE's, and wrote-them off as part of the brain's amazing ability to heal and process disparate bits of data.<br /><br />\\"During my coma my brain wasn't working improperly-- it wasn't working at all. I now believe that this might have been what was responsible for the depth and intensity of the near-death experience (NDE) that I myself underwent during it. Many of the NDEs reported happen when a person's heart has shut down for a while. In those cases, the neocortex is temporarily inactivated, but generally not too damaged, provided that the flow of oxygenated blood is restored through cardiopulmonary resuscitation or reactivation of cardiac function within four minutes or so. But in my case, the neocortex was out of the picture. I was encountering the reality of a world of consciousness that existed completely free of the limitations of my physical brain.\\"  (Kindle Loc. 159-164)<br /><br />After a week in deep coma and multiple excursions into a powerful alternate reality, he permanently changed his way of perceiving the world.  Dr. Alexander was stunned from the hyper-reality of his experience, which many had reported in their NDEs.  After awakening from a week-long coma, he spent the next few years recovering as well as journaling his experience, and researching everything related to the NDE's and the brain.  Of all the various passages in the book, the one I liked the best was his synopsis of the primary message he received.<br /><br />\\"It came in three parts, and to take one more shot at putting it into words (because of course it was initially delivered wordlessly), it would run something like this:<br />You are loved and cherished.<br />You have nothing to fear.<br />There is nothing you can do wrong.<br />If I had to boil this entire message down to one sentence, it would run this way:<br />You are loved.<br />And if I had to boil it down further, to just one word, it would (of course) be, simply: Love.\\"<br />(Loc. 976-982)<br /><br />The type of love that Dr. Alexander is referring to here is pure unconditional Divine Love.  The type of Love referred to in all the scared scriptures of the world, and that we are all asked to emulate.  He wonderfully phrases it as the \\"Reality of all realities\\" (Loc. 985).<br /><br />Returning to this state of Love is not a journey, but a remembering.  Dr. Alexander compares it to Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz always having the ability to return home - but we just forget how to do it.  He eloquently describes how the left-side of the brain appears to filter-out or block our access to memories of Divine Love.  (Loc. 1001)  He further calls us to action to awaken to our true nature while still incarnate.  \\"It is my belief that we are now facing a crucial time in our existence. We need to recover more of that larger knowledge while living here on earth, while our brains (including its left-side analytical parts) are fully functioning.\\" (Loc. 1003-1005).  In the same manner as many sacred scriptures, Dr. Alexander describes how man's separation from God's Love is the basis of all pain and suffering.<br /><br />\\"The (false) suspicion that we can somehow be separated from God is the root of every form of anxiety in the universe, and the cure for it-- which I received partially within the Gateway and completely within the Core -- was the knowledge that nothing can tear us from God, ever.\\"  (Loc. 1050-1052)<br /><br />There are many very quotable elements to be found in Proof of Heaven, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading and thinking about.  Having read a number of NDE descriptions and books, and having one myself, I realize that each is very individualized, as is all of our personal spiritual curriculums.  This very powerful NDE was clearly part of Dr. Alexander's curriculum, which has now led him to become a teacher of the deeper truths that we are all trying to remember.  [[ASIN:1883360269 A Course In Miracles]] speaks very clearly to this, and it is part of the reason why we have no ability to judge another's Journey to peace and awakening.  This journey was clearly part of Dr. Alexander's.  \\"The curriculum is highly individualized, and all aspects are under the Holy Spirit's particular care and guidance.  Ask and He will answer.  The responsibility is His, and He alone is fit to assume it.  To do so is His function.  To refer the questions to Him is yours.\\" (M-29.2.6-10)<br /><br />Thank You, Dr. Alexander, for being willing to be our teacher.re are many very quotable elements to be found in Proof of Heaven, which I thoroughly enjoyed reading and thinking about.

Logitech seems to be unable to speed up their wireless devices sufficient to make them reliable.  I'm a software developer and those devices caused me to be unable to double-click to select a word in a line of code (T650), unable to click-and-drag an object reliably across the screen, it would drop the item somewhere along the line, causing all kinds of mayhem like files to drop in the wrong folder, etc.<br /><br />I decided that I should just go ahead and use a wired device.  Due to my frustration with Logitech devices over the last 12-14 months I decided I'd buy another brand.  The Anker 8000 \\"Gaming Mouse\\" caught my eye due to its price and ratings.  It's got some very nice features even though they're marketed as 'gaming' oriented they're useable during working hours too ;-).
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Different, but good movie. Interesting story line with good acting. If you are looking for a movie that keeps you engrossed, then I recommend this one. Has some subtle comedy mixed in with good drama.
B005544TRQ|4.0|This was recommended to me by a friend.<br />Quite entertaining and funny at a time<br />I'd recommend it to others
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Very neat story line, and of course, good acting. Perhaps the best part of this movie is the twists and turns that keep you guessing. Watch this for a new perspective in futuristic movies.
0345803485|5.0|It was sort of hard to get through the book at first, but I hung in there and was able to see the story line of the series becoming a love story, mystery and all around excellent read.  There were some sex scenes that were a bit difficult to get through but it really was worth it to go on to the next 2 books.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Good actors save the story line in my opinion. This is a fun movie to watch with the whole family, assuming you have teenagers or older.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|We both had so much fun watching this.  Reminded me of oceans 11 which i also loved.  Loved the humor and magic of this show
B001TXWJ4M|4.0|Very enjoyable; the writers definitely keep you guessing as the story line is not what I would call typical. We just got into this as the season finale is close to airing, so we are enjoying it without commercials. Warning if you have not seen this before; it is very addicting. Season 2 is very different from what we expected.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I enjoyed the insight of pliers experience.  She saw the flaws of our system and saw her role in it.

B000024KRO|4.0|This album deserves more respect. The band carries on and continues to thrive with Morse on guitar. An eclectic mix of songs and its a pleasant listening experience. Something for everybody, good music from a great band. I can still go back and play this album all the way through its so good.
B002SHD9E2|4.0|Although I felt the quality of this movie was not great the content is and the music of course is timeless.  I just felt that in most of the black and white sequences it was very grainy and foggy looking, it helped when color came into it, but still the colors were semi muted I wanted it to pop like the stage show.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|worked for me. Cleaned. everything up I needed.Fixed my memory. for my kindle fire. I think it's worth getting.Trust me.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved this movie from start to finish and the quality was exceptional crisp, sharp almost looked like 3-D in parts, colors were amazing.  Cannot wait for Avengers 2 next year hope it lives up to this original in all aspects with content and stars.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|Well, I stayed with it. A bit verbose at times, I skipped over those long winded portions as the point was made and didn't need to be drawn out.  Guess I'm an impatient reader.  Stories should capture our attention within the first chapter or two but not half way through the book. Anyhow, that's my opinion.  The story line is timely, making me think about tween and teen issues for this modern day.  This story offers me the chance to open up dialogue with our tween as to help bring to light the dangers of fast moving technology as well as the over abundance of information being broadcast to us from every media format. Anyway, I would not recommend this book for my book club. Too sad, too real...too much of what I want to avoid when I think of reading a book for relaxation. The news has enough negativity that I suppose I read to escape it as to find goodness somewhere, that happy ending. Won't find that here but that might be what you are looking for. All the best to the author.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|Not as action-packed as the previous three but wonderfully broadening and deepening of a complex and fascinating world! Skim the bits that interest you less if you must.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is okay. I like how the objects are not always in the same place each time you try one of the scenes.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great writing. Bullet-fast reading. I didn't have it figured out until close to the end. Bosch is my favorite character of all time.
B001R6AW18|5.0|So much fun to watch.  Watch King Kong step on the natives.  This is an oldie but goodie.  We are replacing an old VHS
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|action-packed,funny in some parts, what else can you ask for in a movie? this movie will keep you very entertained till the very end.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|For anyone who has lost someone, this movie can bring comfort.  We find it to be some of the best Hollywood has produced in a long time.  It is not out dated or full of smut.  We need more moves with a real message other than sex and murder.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I enjoy this show, I think it could use a bit of deeper plots to explore, but I am only on episode 2!
B004NS710C|5.0|The thrill ride from the beginning.  Very well acted and produced.  In this film the real story really feels real.  Has a good finish and message.
B00622B3MY|4.0|Great film, but too much violence for your young audience. My kid is just 4 years old. No need to show murders, shootings, torture in a kids movie.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Ok special effects, not a great storyline. Lots of potential that just fell flat. Anytime a movie never shows the stars face... Falls in the weird category.
B00FF5SXB8|5.0|And I'm hoping this series lasts as long as Buffy. Interesting new characters, good transition from the last movie, and thoroughly enjoyable. Truth is that this is opposite NCIS which will always win its time slot with me, but I'm hoping that watching Amazon downloads will help this series survive.
0679731725|4.0|A butler who has not travelled much but concentrated on high standards in his work, is in charge of the country house where a Fascist sympathiser lives. This is just prior to the Second World War and the upper class in Britain were largely sympathetic to Fascists because they were not Communists.<br />A new housekeeper arrives and takes charge of her staff. At the same time the butler's father, formerly a butler himself but now 'of a certain age' joins the household as an under-butler. A major international conference is to be held at the Hall, and all must go smoothly.<br /><br />We see interspersed that after the war matters have changed. An American has bought the Hall, the butler is encouraged to borrow the car and take some time to travel, but he is ashamed to speak of his former employer who had once seemed so definite and well-informed. And the housekeeper, alas, has not married the butler which had once seemed a distinct possibility, but has gone to be a wife and mother elsewhere.<br /><br />As this is written from the butler's perspective the language can seem stilted and there are many references to the top butlers of the day, which is all that this man has to fall back on as he has no personal life.  The world changes around him but he finds it hard to change himself. The portrayal of this character is excellently done and the reader is rewarded with an insight into life at this time.<br /><br />The work was filmed with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, and Christopher Reeve. I enjoy the film very much and it depicts the hard work and attitudes of the times.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm not sure why so many people didn't like it, I thought it was great.  If you are a Jack Reacher fan you owe it to yourself to give it a try.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A relaxing and enjoyable game. I love this type of game and was happy to discover it as a fod. Will be playing it a lot in the years to come.
B005USZYDU|2.0|from hjs teen years into how he operated as an adult lawyer and had carried over his style  to that point
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|Great music to keep one working on a project ... mostly uplifting, but also some soothing parts ... very unusual violin sounds ... highly recommend it ...
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Can't connect to other people that are playing.  Please check on this and fix problem please. Also we have had to start the game over a couple of times.
B002SHD9E2|3.0|This is OK but if you see the play this seems weak.  The singing is not as strong, but it is not bad.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game is similar to other crosspic games but with nicer pictures. Mainly posting this review to get bonus pictures without having to like on Facebook.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|I have used this item for almost a year at this point and I would review it as just OK.  The only benefit to this item is that you can attach it to your stroller etc for easy access.  Not the best options for sticking in your diaper bag because the red sliding button opens when you are pushing into a pocket.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview - by Brandt Legg<br />What a tragic yet fascinating story. Nathan's Brother Dustin is safely locked away in a mental institution. He suffers from strange dreams and visions that he calls `outviews'.  Nathan suffers from these visions as well and fears he will be next if he reveals them.<br />I love books with such an immense impact, I couldn't put it down. This father dies and Nathan (Nate) believes he is to blame, but as more tragedy unfolds Nate begins to realise there is more to his world than he realised.<br />Then his world gets worse...<br />Absolutely brilliant story I read it in just a couple of days! Wowed!
B00B3Q7K58|5.0|Used Amazon Prime to catch up for free.  You can tell a lot of money went into making this show.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Very great movie and highly recommend it to everyone. Keeps you wondering and in disbelief throughout the movie. The twist at the end will blow your mind!
B00FEJHPRI|4.0|We are huge fans of the Marvel movies in general and hadn't heard awesome things about this installation of Iron Man. We actually loved it. The first is my favorite because of the character development and this movie gets back there. You get more Tony in it, which I enjoy more than the nonstop action. Great interweaving of this, the Agents of SHIELD tv show, Avengers movie, etc. They've done a great job of being consistent with the story lines and characters in that regard.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|I thought this movie was perfectly cast.  Both Witherspoon and Phoenix brought superb acting (and surprisingly good singing) to the  drama.  Well done.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Really enjoy the concept of taking a TV show about a writer and actually having somebody ghost write a novel. Makes for an excellent tie in.<br /><br />I am typically a fan of murder-mystery novels and this was no exception.<br /><br />If you like the show I would recommend reading this book. If you like murder-mystery novels, I suggest watching the first season of Castle and then reading this book. I think having a bit of a back story as to why the characters are the way they are may be helpful. Definitely do not have to watch the show to enjoy the novel though.
B000M341RI|5.0|May be one of my all time favorite comedies. Following this pack of unemployed gents thru their trials of needing work is none stop fun. Their decision to be a blue collar Chip and Dale team when they feel all else has failed is priceless!! Watch/buy this movie, you will not be disappointed!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game! It's simple yet challenging as the tasks speed up, and the characters are so cute & funny! I also love the video that goes along with it! I highly recommend it! :D
B000002I55|5.0|This album demands your attention.  If you listen to this as background music while you clean your room, it will drive you nuts.  If you really tune in though, it's fascinating.  I love following the little streams of melodic lines that pop up and disappear.  I feel like this album is teaching me how to listen.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Reading this book will make you wonder.  It never occurred to me to question Pi's story as he relates it. Yet it seems perfectly rational that the interviewers do not believe him.  You have to admire Pi's resourcefulness, and his honest portrayal of the brutality, hopelessness, and raw beauty of a life lived in a small boat rocked by the sea and the elements is breathtaking.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Thankfully I haven't had anyone in my family diagnosed with Alzheimers, but if I had I'm not sure I could have read this book. It was pretty intense. The author did a great job of giving us a glimpse into the life of an early onset Alzheimers patient. There were a few scenes that were so sad, I found it difficult to read. My only criticism is all the medical terminology. I ended up skimming through those parts.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so addictive..lots of fun..love it. Wish there were many more GAMES to choose and download. I've been playing for the past two hours and haven't been able to finish my house work.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really enjoyed the book. It was mentioned as a book for our Evening Book. I am leading the discussion and can hardly wait. It started out slow but I tend to be impatient. After I got into it, I was fascinated. Great character development.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book is a bit of a disappointment. It left A LOT of things in the wind. I'm very sad this is the last book!!
B000PKX2KA|3.0|It connects easy but some programs don't like to play nice and you have to go in and change what port there reading from. After that ordeal it works like a dream
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|First of all I love period pieces and was looking for a new one when someone told me about this one!<br />It was love at first sight! They get you hooked right away and leave you wanting more at the end of each episode!<br />It has everything! It is Scandalous, sexy, witty, pretentious at times but most of the time the family is very sensitive to the needs of others (their Staff) and others.<br />It's wonderful!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|Movie was very well done. if you are into the future type movie it's great. i would watch it again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once again a great read by a master author. I was swept away in that familiar Stephen King whirlwind, all cares forgotten.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book.  I loved everything about it and read it all in one sitting.<br /><br />We had a very extensive library.  Dean Koontz covered a couple of shelves with all his books, but we moved and donated all our books, so I had to start replenishing my new Kindle library with my favorites.  Watchers was the first<br />MUST have book.<br /><br />Penny
B00ECLU346|1.0|I'd rather watch my 3 year old make funny faces, what a junky film this was.<br />It doesn't even deserve the 20 words that are needed to describe it.<br />simply put, don't even spend .50c or your time watching this film.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|I purchased this for school.  Serves it's purpose.  I had very interesting results from the quiz; I may even go back and read it.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|This is one of the best movie series ever.  Good family fun.  My kids love it and it's not annoying like other movies.
0061726834|5.0|Great book if you are interested in Hunger Games and Divergent series. If you buy this, your better off buying the whole series.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Like that I can color code my notes. Date is easy to find as well for each note. Overall very useful.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the first to watch it before it was so popular.<br />Could watch again and again and have.  Wonderful!  Can't wait for the next season.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Great Western with a hint of SciFi ....a strange mix but very, very well done!<br />Daniel Craig is a great action hero, regardless of whether he is James Bond or a Cowboy in the Wild West.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Hennessyech oh Hip OH go inv by mmb to :) hi in yup uhh B-) :/ no hi uhh ho :) hi on HI in hip OH go on ho
B002ZG981E|4.0|Kind of like a strange dream version of the Matrix. A lot of twists and turns but very thought provoking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app it's so much fun to play and it's addictive I really like this app you should so play this
B008VNIA32|4.0|The DVD and Show was very nice but one ordering this DVD should realized that the time line for this Opera seems to be set  in a more modern time.  You will not see Brunhilde in her suit of armor. The warriors are more in their Matrix overcoat outfits.  Odin in his glasses with one lens tinted was not very convincing for me and did not draw me into the world of the Norse Gods.  IMHO<br />The show and sound quality were very nice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it keeps me on my toes . I love that it challenges my hand eye coordination and that I can challenge my friends
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Gave it to my niece who hasn't reported to me yet. It just looks fantastic and I'll know if it did its magic when the kid pulls herself up to full height and starts reciting. Come on, it's Alice. It would have to have arrived broken to not be loaded with socially redeeming value!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I've seen all the Star Trek series and movies, this crew of actors is by far the best.  Funny, action packed, I like the new twists on themes from the originals,,,,, hope they make many more..
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|Everything about the movie is genuine. It's not an over the top CGI action bonanza. Ron Howard is one of my favorite directors and he delivers here. The movie is actually more of a character piece so be aware of that going in. The actor who plays Nikki Lauda gives a uniquely interesting performance, a real fire cracker to watch in every scene. Howard was brilliant to cast Hemsworth also as the bad boy racer who smiles and charms his way in most scenes as the real character did in life. The race scenes got my adrenaline going too, the sound of the engines roaring was amazing. This is real drama. Well done, Ron! You should've hauled in Oscars for Cinderella Man by the way...
B007SGM084|4.0|A interesting look at how childhood neglect can shape ones sexual orientation. Amazing what total trust and devotion can do to change it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Marvel has brought it all together with this cast. Action, adventure and fun. Super heroes still bring out the kid in me. Thanks.
1596438274|4.0|My aunt worked on the Manhattan project. She said she had no idea what she was working on until the information was declassified. Sad to say I didn't even know what the Manhattan project was when she told me. I'd never even heard of it and the only scientists associated with the project whose names I knew were Bohr, Einstein, and Fermi. Consequently I found \\"Feynman\\" enlightening.<br /><br />I think it was a brilliant idea for the authors to put Feynman's story in the graphic novel form as this genre has a huge following with the younger generation. Graphic novels about people who made huge changes in the way we approach science today will tantalize them to delve deeper into the subject. I know it has done this for me. I am not a scientist but I like to push my levels of understanding, I plan to read more on Feynman and check out his lectures. If \\"Feynman\\" had this effect on me, I can only image how it will inspire the many curious kids out there who easily grasp the science in this book. They will be tantalized into moving on to sources with much more detailed scientific information.<br /><br />Since graphic novels appeal to children I want to mention that \\"Feynman\\" includes how enjoyed spending time in \\"Gentlemen's Clubs\\" and how he went to court for one place that ran into legal troubles. In this we learn that Feynman was not a hypocrite who acted one way in private but hiding when the public eye might turn sour. If you have younger children with voracious reading appetites as we do, you will want to be prepared to explain or prepare the kids for what they will encounter. Feynman had no problem going to these types of clubs and also nude beaches, but you may; so you'll have to address the subject from your point of view because the kids will see nude or partially nude women. It is tastefully done and not gratuitous in anyway, but if you are not ready for your kids to see this yet or want to express your take on these establishments before they read the book, please be informed.<br /><br />Regarding the graphics: A++<br />Dialogue/text: B+ (sometimes the connections were a little loose, and in need of some transitional dialogue/picures
B00F91G5BS|3.0|Overall good movie. All action, all the time throughout the entire film. Only caveat, I'm not a huge fan of the Z's.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Every device I own that can have Kindle on it, has it. I love reading on tablets, phones, and dedicated Kindles. So much easier to carry around then a set of books...
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Have been a Trekkie all my life. New cast, new special effects, action great! Only caveat, didn't like re-living an old story.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|George C. Scott is superb in portraying General Patton --- it is obvious that he spent many long hours studying Gen. Patton.  This is my favorite movie of my generation and the best historical drama of WW2 that I've seen.  The movie starts with Patton (2 star gen) taking over the allied African campaign from a failed British general.  It progresses through his career from there, invasion of Sicily, slapping of a GI coward, Patton as a decoy, commander of the 3rd Army, rescue of the men pinned down a Bastone, on up to his death caused by an automobile accident (questionable).  Great WW2 flick, Great Bio of Gen Patton's WW2 years, Superb acting, Superb movie is all respects.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Makes for a nice additional story to the original Wizard of Oz. James Franco and all the cast were believable.
B00DMEQP2S|5.0|I must say I've been a huge fan of MGMT ever since I listened to Congratulations, before that i was only familiar with their hits of TTP, EF and Kids but theyre so much deeper than that and the other tracks of Oracular proved it. A lot of people are quick to bash this album having only listened to it once and never really understanding or getting the music at all, the typical \\"oh we hate MGMT cause they dont make hits anymore\\" type. Anyway, this album took a couple of listens but i can say its amazingly done and incredibly out there, the most rewarding pieces of music i've heard all year. It always takes me sometime to understand but standout tracks like Alien Days, Cool Song No2 and Mystery Disease all did it for me right away. Im still on the fence with Astro-Mancy but its growing on me like the whole album did from start to finish. To those bashing with one star and having one sentence reviews you could have at least gave it another chance or listen but i understand why people would be quick to hate. Sometimes musics and things in general are better when theyre not understood the first time, thats why there are plenty of things which are popular that werent when they were initially released. If youre a fan of Congratulations you will probably like this album, if youre hear for the hits off of Oracular Spectacular dont even bother listening and stay in the past, this is MGMT.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I had yet to see this movie though many had told me about it. I bought it and enjoyed every minute of it. It is definitely appropriate for children and adults alike. It has a bit of adventure and a cute side romance.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the book... Can not wait for the next book to come out.... These books keep you on your toes
B0081336FO|5.0|I binged both seasons in practically one sitting--couldn't stop.  It was great.  Cumberbatch is so engaging you can't stop watching him.  My only complaint was the character of Moriarty: the role was written, directed and played just a wee bit too chewy for my taste.  I was distracted by the nearly clownish elements where that character should have been pure menace.  I won't fault the actor for this as he did a great job, but I wish the role had been rendered more villainous and evil in general.<br /><br />HUGE shout out to the amazing Lara Pulver as 'Irene Adler'.  Her performance alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Overall, it's genius and I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys great writing, acting and fun, interesting storylines.  You will be engaged and you will fall under Sherlock's spell.  Can't wait to see Season 3!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|SKIP TO PROS and CONS if you dont care about comparing it to other mice!<br /><br />I am an experienced gammer with  a lot of play time under my belt. I play everything from Sandbox games to FPS's, to DOTA type of games. I have had all sorts of gaming mice to compare this too. I had a mionix 5000, razer deathadder, MadCatz R.A.T 7  and now this Anker. So its been about 4 days so far that I have been using this. In all honesty it is not as good as the Mionix (which if I had the money I would go with again), but it is better than the others I have mentioned. I would strongly suggest this mouse for anyone that even wants a better than average mouse. The plug and play feature is extremely nice, since my Razer DeathAdder required drivers for it to even work for more than 5 seconds. (WARNING DEATHADDER 2013 is prone to becoming bricked after firmware). Not to say it wasn't a good mouse. Any way comparatively speaking this mouse is the best one I have owned since the Mionix 5000. It seems more durable than others, drivers seems solid and buttons feel secure. It has a higher arch than most mice, so not for clawers, and it is a little on the thin side for width. Overall, I have BEAR Claws for hands and this mouse fits my palm grip style of play. Just my pinky hangs off to the side sometimes(nothing a simple mouse pad wont fix).<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Fits bigger hands and comfortable ergonomic design<br />- Glide padding on bottom makes it smooth on any surface<br />- Cool features in software (DPI Switching, Profile Switching, Macro's and Button Assingments)<br />- Braided cable<br />- Weights that can be added(NOTE: Only adds about an extra 8 grams so not a huge difference but enough)<br />- Scroll wheel feels secure and not uncomfortably located(Not towards the front)<br />- Extremely Good price for this level of a gaming mouse<br />- Very responsive<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Still would like to have had a little more room to the right of the mouse so my pinky fingure doesnt drag<br />- Doesn't have a direct download link in manual for drivers and software(Still easy to find on ankers website)<br />- Would have like a little bit longer of a braided cable(Pretty sure it was a 4ft cable, but thats what they make usb extensions for!)<br />- Wish that when you change the color that it would do so for the entire mouse not just the anker logo that my hand covers(Don't care enough myself to really complain about this, but some people do).<br />- Feels somewhat like cheep plastice on the sides(but again not really carring)<br /><br />Get his mouse if you are on a tight budget, or if you dont feel like you can justify $80 for a Mionix. NOTE: Razer NAGA 3200 DPI for $75-80 or this for $45-50 with 8000 DPI Max(mostly just made up marketing numbers like contrast ratios). Take the time to think about what mouse you want because it is something you need to feel comfortable with.<br /><br />(UPDATE)<br />Its been about a month since I got this item. So far still in excellent shape. Still all the same thoughts from when I first got it. I still think its an excellent mouse and feel that its better than most mice. Especially better than the ones that cost twice as much as this one with \\"Name\\" branding.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Looking foreword to the next season.  A very easy to watch relaxing show that will make you laugh and sometimes cry.

B00F2J2LRE|5.0|I have always been more of a Madonna fan and found myself to like the occasional Cher song. However, she blew me away with this record. There is hardly any filler and most songs sound like they could be singles. Hope she gets some recognition for her efforts
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Easy to control, fun to play, handy for magic fans.  Deck building is limited but does not hinder my enjoyment of this app.  Solid MTG software entry.
B00E9P959O|5.0|The new Rush Vapor Trails remixed album is 100% better than the original. The original one had great songs that were terribly mastered. It was exhausting to listen to, and the CD felt like it took FOREVER to get over with. I only listened to it once or twice. The remixed & remastered album feels like a new album, everything is clear, the instruments have room to breathe, and the brilliance of the songs shines through.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Raining, pancakes, no where to go , PJ day, in love and thinking of going back to bed. There is nothing Jack can do that I don't love. This album (I'm old) is soft and romantic. The man can do no wrong.

B000SEGSB8|5.0|[[ASIN:0143037757 Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945]]<br />All the following are my personal opinions and reactions: This is the best book I have read in my life. (I have read many books, but no history books since I took history classes.) It is written in most places like a fast-paced novel; with the end of one section establishing the next. Its strongest feature is not the history itself, but the psychology; the explanation of what happened in terms of people's emotions and feelings. Most of the motivations for the Cold War involved Europe, and most of the history of Europe during this period involved the Cold War. This book is essential for those non-historians who wish to understand the Cold War; how it originated, why it was sustained, and why it ended.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Nothing too fancy. If you are just looking for a straight forward chess game, this will do just fine. Only complaint is the computer does not submit defeat when its king gets cornered. Ends the game with a stalemate.
B007XNAOS0|5.0|When a band starts to evolve in such a way that they seem to no longer resemble their past output, there is always a risk of experiencing a disconnect as a listener. On the flip side, some artists have to grow in such a way to feel creative and relevant. I try to understand both viewpoints. As a listener, the best example I can think of of feeling left behind by a band I once championed would be Metallica. To this day, I cannot hear a song from the infamous Black album and not feel that I was never the intended audience. In short, fame was sought and achieved and in return, high school cheerleaders nationwide had \\"Enter Sandman\\" to craft a routine around. With \\"Yellow & Green\\", some of the same complaints were uttered. Even upon first listen, I was feeling confused and disappointed that yet another band was leaving behind a slew of top shelf material for possible attention elsewhere. After what feels like a thousand listens since then, I can assure you that I was completely wrong.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Baroness has softened the surface level approach on this double album. For the most part, gone are the barrage of stampeding riffs and mammoth driving percussive rhythms. While the opening track \\"Take My Bones Away\\" starts things off in expected fashion, songs like \\"Little Things\\" opt for more air and my favorite track \\"Cocanium\\" gets more psychedelic and haunting. Move on to \\"Back Where I Belong\\" and you begin to see that where Baroness has stripped some of the heavier tinges, there is expert craftsmanship to these songs. As there is an ebb and flow from song to song where things morph between light, dark, heavy, moody and so on, there is no denying that time and effort went into making these songs meaningful on multiple levels.<br /><br />I will admit that there is a small and dwindling part of myself that wonders if a time will come where Baroness is no longer recognizable. The more you experience these two discs, the more you realize that the evolution from \\"Blue Record\\" makes perfect sense. Still, the difference is also noticeable. For now, you can be certain that if you love Baroness' earlier output, \\"Yellow & Green\\" will occupy significant playing time in your stereo. It really is an accomplishment of rarefied air.from \\"Blue Record\\" makes perfect sense. Still, the difference is also noticeable.

B001QKSWOE|5.0|I have read this book twice so far and both times I have enjoyed it. I like the mystical part. It is a nice way to temporarily escape the hum drum of every day living. You always know Stephanie is going to get herself in and out of trouble, few cars will get blown up, and that Ranger always has her back.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My family enjoyed this series together. The actors were very well suited to their parts. A clean show, enjoyable for all ages.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Found the characters hard to keep track of. Author jumped back and forth in time too much. Really enjoyed the last 40/50 pages though. Khaled Hosseini is an awesome writer. I am going to start reading the book again to clarify things in my own mind.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|I have a love hate relationship with the new Star Trek movies. Being a huge fan of the original Star Trek movies, I can tell that this movie is a rewrite of Star Trek: The Wrath of Kahn. This is why I only give it 3 stars. Whoever wrote the script should have come up with something more original instead of &#34;borrowing&#34; from Roddenberry's original idea.Using an updated version of the original tv musical score at the end of the movie does not influence my opinion that this movie was a rip-off of the original ST: TWOK movie. Role reversals and hop scotching enemies from Kahn to Marcus to Kahn was just silly.<br /><br />In spite of being a rip-off, this movie has plenty of content to stand apart from the original. The only way this was accomplished, was having the Leonard Nemoy cameo as Spock to remind viewers that this is a different timeline from the original movies. Kirk's actions and punishment in the beginning of the movie were mind blowing, but set the stage for the rest of the movie. The introduction of the Dreadnought class of starship was incredibly cool, as they never existed in the originals. Wished there had been more about it, and that Scotty had brought some of the specs of that ship to the relaunched Enterprise at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Other than that, the rest of the movie is a rip-off of the original. Spock becomes the hero instead of Kirk?!?! Marcus was more of an enemy than Kahn?!?! Glorifying an actor's sexual preference seems to be hollywood's agenda nowadays, but irregardless, this rewrite isn't as good as the original even with this preferential treatment.<br /><br /> I think in the sequel to this movie the writers need to stop borrowing from the originals, and be a little more creative. If you cannot come up with something more original, stop writing.

0143119680|5.0|I pick up this heavy Trade Paperback, which no one in their right mind would want in an MMPB, unless as with The Joy of Cooking edition in the mid-70's you make it into two volumes, and begin to read.<br />Rare book library<br />Oxford<br />Blackwell's<br />Alchemy<br />late 16th Century England<br />Historian<br />early printed books<br />16th C. manuscripts<br />languages of 16th C. Europe<br />Occitan<br />Wiccan<br />Witch<br />erm, when's she going to run out of things linked to these that catch my interest?<br /><br />When in the SCA, my persona was from Tudor/Elizabethan England. I speak English and French, understand a fair bit of Latin, Old French, not so much Langue d'Oc, but recognize it. I worked in a rare book research library centered around that scientist, philiosopher, courtier, writer, and so forth, Francis Bacon, which did business with Blackwell's on a regular basis--long before BookCaf&eacute;s were common. I happen to be Wiccan, and am always interested in how the spirituality and mechanics of magic of witches is portrayed/explained. IRL, not all Witches are Wiccan, and vice versa.<br /><br />I swear, every chapter there was some new thread of a conmmon interest to draw me deeper into the book. For me, it was the world-building that grabbed me more than the characters at first--not that the characters were slouches, either. Usually it is characters of interest and sympathy that keep me in a book, but this time, I wasn't paying as much attention to character development as I usually do. I can't remember the last time I spent so much time marveling at \\"the scenery\\" in a novel.<br /><br />When we get to genetic data in the novel, I find that 23andMe has just finished working on my sample, so that tied me into that pattern as well. It just didn't stop, even though I was not deluged with musical tugs of memory.<br /><br />The answer is that Dr. Harkness never did seem to run out of things that would grab my interest. I admit that some of the meetings between Diana and Matthew reminded me of Gaudy Night by Dorothy Sayers, but heck, it's set at Oxford, there's boating down the Isis, a woman scholar pursued by an older male scholar of good family...right?<br /><br />I tried to slow down so that the Shadow of Night, the next volume, could arrive before I had withdrawal fits. Have you ever noticed that you have certain hulking hefty tomes, and you wonder how you're ever going to get through it before a year can pass, but around 3/4 of the way through, you realize you don't *want* the book to end, heavy on your wrists though it might be?<br /><br />This was one of them.<br /><br />Whether Dr. Harkness has read any of Mary Luke's works on Tudor women, I do not know. I did, as the library brought them in, and read her non-fiction on Jane Grey, Mary Tudor, and Elizabeth Tudor, as well as her two novels, one about Queen Katherine Parr, and The Nonesuch Lure. The Ivy Crown, about Katherine Parr, might have been her non-fiction, and her non-fiction, fiction, as easy as they read and as packed full of detailed research as they were.<br /><br />I haven't read Dr. Harkness' historical work, but I'm willing to bet it's as easily read and delightful in the doing.<br /><br />Go read this book. Paper, electronic, or audio--take it in! Darned good yarn, well told.en Diana and Matthew reminded me of Gaudy Night by Dorothy Sayers, but heck, it's set at Oxford, there's boating down the Isis, a woman scholar pursued by an older male scholar of good family...right?<br /><br />I tried to slow down so that the Shadow of Night, the next volume, could arrive before I had withdrawal fits.

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This movie was really cool. It was kind of a sci-fi dredd meets a tiny shade of robo-cop, but in a good way. The main character is the doctor from Star Trek. Didnt realize it until I watched it the second time. Pretty good job keeping that Dredd voice in check. Great action scenes like a dude wants.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|The book shines a light on the damaged legal system and the prison system. It would be nice if the book could make a difference, but it won't because not enough people (re: white, politicians) care enough to fix it. The state level systems are probably not better, perhaps even worse, at least in some states. It was interesting to see the similarities between this and the Netflix series. And yes, I am one of the many who watched the series before reading the book.

B003K15IF8|2.0|This is  a well, if pedestrian, written, kind of academic novel cum workshop product cum ordinary man narrative about the entire arc of a man's life who begins on a hardscrabble farm, becomes a professor, runs into academic politics, a bad marriage, a love affair stifled by contemporary mores, to his death.  It's done well but has nothing particular to recommend it in thought, style, depiction of mores, or character analysis.  It's a good job with no shine.  Kind of a Mme Bovary without  the mot juste or the original vision.  It's also kind of depressing since we are left with the feeling that this man's life was basically a disappointment to him and thus rather pointless, metaphysically.

It is NOT a mess as is previously mentioned but rather an extension of the first novel, so beautifully written, and insightful that continually refer the many passages that highlighted to remind myself of how a true craftsman can illuminate a subject, time and place.<br /><br />My only gripe is that I finished the novel so long ago and have been waiting patently for the next installment without any idea of when I will be rewarded.

B00E9E4EC8|4.0|I have been a fan of bluegrass since \\"O Brother...\\", and while I don't listen to bluegrass 24/7, it is a nice alternative to what Nashville has to offer. When Alan first expressed the idea of a bluegrass album a couple years ago, I was curious! However, the first listen or two, I was thinking, \\"this is crap!!\\". But I had to forget Alan's track record and look at it in a new way. This is music Alan WANTED to make. It is a shame Arista/RCA wouldn't let him do so. Thank God for Capitol/EMI !! The backing band plays their hearts out. And while Alan's voice is not your typical blue grass voice, he could easily fit into the format. The songs are well written and sung well.

B006O5YIMQ|5.0|While this film is not without flaws, it is easy to overlook the few that are there while enjoying the many things that are done well. The basic premise is formulaic; the fighting triumph story you've heard a million times before. However, it is not the fighting, or the triumph that really make this film sing. It's the family dynamics that provide the underpinning and make the build all the more spectacular.<br /><br />I'm not an MMA fan, or fight fan of any type, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Watched it with my [pacifistic] girlfriend, and she enjoyed it very much as well. Check it out.

B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I highly recommend this book not only to people who are at the risk of getting brain disorders but also to the young generations. This book contains all the information that we have to know whenever we eat something. Readers can get advices on diet/food intake from this book without going to doctors. And those advices are not only linked to getting healthy but also to preventing the dementia or any other brain disorders. Dr. David Perlmutter does not just throw some ideas to the readers; rather he explains why it happens or how to stop it. He also explains the relation between the nutrient and brain disorder that what chemical and biological factors of nutrient are actually causing the illness. I think everyone should read this book at least once because we all depend on the food intake. The earlier you know, the more you can prevent the brain diseases.<br /><br />In the introduction of this book, Dr. Perlmutter includes self-assessment page where the readers can define what are their risk factors for getting brain disorders. He also explains that he would provide information useful for the following brain illness: ADHD, anxiety, depression, diabetes, epilepsy, dementia, etc. He states that he would prove to the readers about how daily habit affects the function and long-term health of brain.<br />Part 1, \\"The Whole Grain Truth\\", discusses about the common ingredients such as wheat and fats that are both friends and enemies of the brain. It is divided into six chapters, the first three chapters discusses about the inflammation process, the role of gluten, carbohydrates and fats in inflammation, and the inflammation as the heart of brain disease. He also covers psychological and behavioral disorders that food choices can change an individual genetic characteristic and eventually leads to the brain illness. In the last chapter of part 1, the author focuses on how the gluten can impinge the long-term health and functions of the brain; people should keep breads away from them.<br />Part 2, \\"The Grain Brain Rehab\\", mainly discusses about the science beyond the habits that support a healthy brain. Divided into three chapters, he explores the relationship of nutrition and supplements, exercise, and sleep to brain disorders individually. He recommends the dietary habits that people should follow for healthy brain: the daily exercise routine to have better genes in the brain: the sleep routine to maintain stable hormone levels.<br />In the part 3, \\"Say Good-Bye to Grain Brain\\", the author actually recommends a month-long program with the meal plan, recipes, and weekly goal. He, in details, provides what should be taken everyday, and what must be forbidden for intake during lifetime. This recipe and diet plan would lead people to change their diet habits and help keep healthy brain consistently.<br /><br />In this book, the style and structure is simple and easy to follow. First, Dr. Perlmutter follows the structure of having a proposal, evidences and recommendations. He first proposes how each nutrient and daily habits can affect the health of brain. Then, he provides evidence to support his thesis by explaining the chemical and biological mechanism of each food intake and the effect of sleep and exercise. Finally, he gives a recommendation on how to avoid brain illness in the future with his own version of meal plan, recipe, and weekly goals. Therefore, people with no scientific background can all understand what the author is trying to explain. Also, whenever he introduces new biochemical concepts, he explains in-depth so that readers will not get lost. In the beginning of each chapter, he gives an overview of what will be in there. For example, in chapter 6, he gives all the list of changes that sugars can trigger in the short-term basis: behavior, seize control of focus and concentration, tic disorders and mood conditions such as depression. In terms of the style, I was able to observe the author's effort of trying to make a connection with the readers by questioning and stating his past daily habits. The readers would fully respond only if they have the same experience as the discussion topic of the author. However, there were not enough pictures or graphs that could assist the readers to understand the context. The font size and spacing was viewable. The headings were appropriately positioned and fully caught the attention of readers.<br /><br />I read this book to find out the relationship between diet and Alzheimer's disease. The book covered this topic with appropriate volume but the book itself actually gave full information about the effect of each nutrient and supplements on the health of brain. First, he proved that the inflammation would lead to the cause of Alzheimer's disease because of \\"toxic sugar inflicts\\"(pg. 29). The insulin resistance from sugar, \\"sparks the formation of those infamous plaques that are present in diseased brains\\", especially in Alzheimer's disease (pg. 30). Because these plaques would buildup and take place of normal brain cells, the diabetes patient will have higher chance of getting Alzheimer's disease. It was interesting to see how diabetes and Alzheimer's disease was related together. I have read several research articles about their relationship but it was interesting to find out how food intake can be a key connector between these two diseases. In the later chapter, he also discusses about the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease due to diabetes. Since diabetes are also caused by high intake of carbs and sugars, it will definitely increase the risk of Alzheimer by increasing the inflammation and triggering the formation of insoluble protein plaques.<br />He also included a report, published in 2005, to indicate the relationship between the cholesterol level and cognitive ability. As Alzheimer's diseased patients have very low cognitive ability, I believed that high cholesterol level would actually decrease the cognition. However, he stated \\"people whohad the highest cholesterol levels scored higher on cognitive tests than those with lower levels\\"(pg. 34). It was interesting to find out that there has to be a \\"protective factor\\" from cholesterol that can maintain the cognitive skills.<br />He then defines the elevations of cytokine as the hallmarks of the Alzheimer's disease. Gluten \\"increases the production of inflammatory cytokines\\" and such inflammation can actually prevent the production of soluble proteins and deposition of unnecessary cells in the brain, increasing the formation of insoluble plaques.<br /><br />This book is definitely giving an advice to lose wheat and maintain low sugar level in our body. The intake of grain is actually increasing the risk of many brain disorders including ADHD, severe depression, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, etc. I would recommend this book even to the patient so that they do not have to solely depend on the medication, rather they should try a new lifestyle as Dr. Perlmutter recommends in the last chapter. This book is also recommended for young generation who has enough time to prevent the brain illness by reading this book and altering their diet plan. For potential readers, I would recommend to write current daily food intake before reading this book. By analyzing what you have eaten everyday based on this book, you would be able to find out your own risk factors to brain disorders. Also, try to read this book with whole family. Your daily food intake highly depends on family members, thus to get altered in a short term you must change your family's lifestyle.
0307474259|5.0|Awesome book, so helpful. I've been an exerciser/dieter/binger/restricter for most of my life. I could never figure out why the hek I seemed to be doing \\"everything\\" right, but not getting great results. This book is filled with common sense. Cutting back on my sugar and lowering my carbs has been a challenge and learning process, but I'm up for it. Why we get fat just makes so much sense. I loved it so much I have recommended it to many friends. I will be reading \\"Good Calories/Bad Calories\\" asap.

B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Up to about 30% through this book I wasn't sure if I wanted to finish it. I found the flashbacks very confusing at first. Probably because the world building is handled very delicately- the reader less gets an introduction to the world and more gets to watch it come to life around the characters. Which was honestly why I kept reading. Even though I wasn't initially caught up in the book little details about the world, the colors, the scents, the sounds hooked me in. Once I was in I didn't want out. I fully intend to continue on in the series.<br /><br />I will say the author chooses some very unique words to describe skin tone.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Excellent book! I recomend it to any one! What a different perspective between two worlds. Just the difference between thought patterns.

0062073486|5.0|As a kid I read every single Agatha Christie book ever written, and I own every single one. Every now and then I go back and re-read one of my collection. And Then There Were None is one of my favorites. No one writes like Agatha Christie wrote, no one. Her books remind me of a simpler time when murder was unusual, not the norm as we are facing now on a daily basis. All this reminds me to pray and I want to share a new book which helped me greatly along those lines. Lin Tomasso's book Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered showed me the mistakes I was making and how to correct them to get my prayers answered. I downloaded it to my laptop (you can download it to your computer or any other device) for $2.99 at smashwords.com. This new author is down to earth and on point and will show you the prayer formula that works. She also includes her real life anecdotes which are hysterical, and will make you laugh out loud. Kudos to the Dame and to new author Lin Tomasso. You have entertained and helped me tremendously.

A refreshing twist on the innocent college kids being victimized by crazed hillbillies theme ,it has earned a place in the ' keeper ' section of my collection .<br />  I'll leave the review of the content to the other reviewers who've already covered that ground and just say &#34; I like it .&#34;
B00FJ30OD6|5.0|The inaugural episode of this season of The Good Wife is worth a play and a re-play for its tightly wound acting and action.  The dramatics are flawless and the script spares not a single word.  Even if you have never seen this series before, I recommend you seeing this episode because it is television drama at its best.  That includes the synchronization of music, so well chosen, as well as the light humor in the robotic tele-commuter.  Kudos all around.

I rarely miss one of his books, but when I saw that this one was essentially a sequel to The Shining, I couldn't wait to revisit one of the scariest stories I've ever read. Since it had been awhile since I visited the dark part of one of my favorite author's mind, somehow I had forgotten how he grabs his constant reader on dual levels of horror - the obvious realm of the paranormal and the somewhat more subtle yet equally horrifying world that we live in from day-to-day.<br /><br />I was happy to see my old friend Danny Torrance, now all grown up, still haunted, and utterly flawed. I'm not sure Doctor Sleep was quite as scary as The Shining, but it was still one hell of a ride!

B00BWLKTOS|4.0|I can't say that I like this album as much as I liked the first, but it is a really good album.  Twinkle Lullaby is so beautiful I listen to it over and over.  I also like how they did the Pachelbel Canon.  It's one of my favorite pieces of music, but it can get a bit dull.  This version really livens up the piece while remaining true to the music itself.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|- update -<br /><br />i've increased the review to 4 stars. after giving it more chances, this album actually grew on me a lot more. while i did give it more criticism before with my previous posted review (below), its actually not as bad i was made it out to be. while it was difficult at first, it does take sequential listens - but at the same time, i received a new sound system and that greatly made me hear it in better detail.<br /><br />i didnt bother listening to this via iTunes when it was announce that it would stream entirely for free [i dont support Apple as you can see]. Instead, i just went ahead and purchased on CD, a mere few days before release. that is, until Amazon shipped it and found out i can listen to it in its entirely via Amazon MP3.<br /><br />But on point, compared to Experience 1 of 2, this record is very difficult to listen to. The production value is obviously different, and so are the lyrical themes, as this album takes approach of a more, dark fitting. while i do have a fondness for music being even somewhat dark, Experience 2 of 2 doesnt really do it a mature sense. the single 'Take Back the Night' was an easy listener from a few months ago, as it felt like a reminiscent of Michael Jackson's 'Off the Wall' days, therefore assuming this record would be a strong follow up.<br /><br />In fact, even with Experience 1 of 2, i ended up listening to the non-single songs quite a bit. You know when you have a made a valuable production, when half, most, or even everything on the record is listenable and repeatable. in Experience 2 of 2's case, it wasnt like that for me. I normally dont like shuffling and hopping over songs out of order, but it seemed like i didnt have a choice for this record.<br /><br />Stand Out Tracks:<br /><br />True Blood (very groove-popish and lengthy)<br />Take Back the Night (Off the Wall reminiscence)<br />Amnesia (sounds like a \\"sort-of\\" sequel to Mirrors)
B00B8ED7OS|5.0|This is the first time I've read anything from Hermit and Star and I'm happy I invested the time. This is an erotic same-sex romance story, with elements of horror thrown in for good measure - this was a another first time for me! The characters develop well and the storyline does more than enough to keep you interested. This is definitely not a book for children, but for consenting adults, this is an original tale that'll keep you entertained throughout.

B008AVXGA2|5.0|A great story, well executed. This is said to be an updated version of an old Russian tale, but to me it was new and perfect. The two innocent kids being put up against the evil witch is a classic scenario in children's stories and it works great again in this book. There's some good descriptive writing too, so overall I was very happy to find it.

B000FCKPHG|5.0|As a teacher, it is great to have this wealth of information to help my students excel. I had no idea how powerful the mind is in opening up your own mind to learning. I didn't realize that we hold ourselves back by deciding we can't learn something when all we needed to do was realize that we can.<br />This applies to more than just school. It includes our ability to speak in public, our sports abilities, management skills, apparently we can talk ourselves out of doing well any number of ways.<br />The examples are amazing and can be applied to many walks of life. You don't have to be a teacher to benefit. A business owner, parent, or student would be enriched by this book.

B0016YBFZ8|5.0|As I haven't bought the DVD I can only comment on the film itself, but I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's one of my favorites, it's Scorsese's best film, and it's both fun and unsettling to watch. Ultimately, this movie is the world's ugliest love story. The characters are seduced by the allure of the mafia, but the film shows us just how ugly and brutal their lives really are. It's a far cry from the romantic portrayal of the mafia that you get in The Godfather. Scorsese does a magnificent job of balancing the characters' perspective with the viewers'; there's no moral relativism here, even though the movie is structured through Henry's and, to a lesser extent, his wife Karen's narration. That being said, the movie is violent and absolutely crammed with expletives (it ranks #12 on the list of films with the most frequent use the f-word), so if those are a deal-breaker for you then I'd pass on Goodfellas. Otherwise, this is a film you should NOT miss!

B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|There will be many distractions during Cloud Atlas which will ask you to stop watching the film and to give  attention to the things that need to be done. However I kept on watching the film, Cloud Atlas is a very long movie and I am not saying that it is a very riveting affair all the time but it is a very absorbing and and a beautiful affair to watch. What is amazing that a spare cast takes on multiple roles over many centuries and play these roles which such an amazing ease. Tom Hanks has almost 6 six roles unless I missed some during the film. Same goes for Hugo Weaving he plays six roles as well.<br />The movie spans from a slave ship in the early 1800's to a futuristic Seoul set in 2144 and about various individuals throughout time who are interconnected by a birthmark.<br />Cloud Atlas is based on David Mitchell's 2004 novel run at 2 hours and 52 minutes long and by no means an easy film to watch there is a lot of things that need to be digested and understood it you want to grasp the films lavish scale. However what struck out the most is the beauty of the film and its lush locations.<br />There are six stories beginning with the \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,\\" which takes place on a ship and a  friendship that develops between a lawyer (Jim Sturgess) and a  slave (David Gyasi). The second story is , \\"Letters from Zedelghem,\\" about a partnership between  a musician (Ben Whishaw) and a reclusive composer (Jim Broadbent) for whom he works as an amanuensis. \\"Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery\\" is set in the 1970s about Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) a journalist who unravels a plot by an oil  executive (Hugh Grant) to allow a nuclear reactor to melt. The fourth tale is, \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\" is about a British publisher (Jim Broadbent) who is banished by his brother to  a bizarre nursing home. . \\"An Orison of Sonmi~451\\" about genetically engineered  (Doona Bae) who  is used by revolutionaries to be the figurehead for their rebellion. The sixth and final story, \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After\\" takes place in a time beyond the 22nd century when  tribesman (Tom Hanks) befriends a woman (Halle Berry) who belongs to a technologically advanced culture.<br />All these story are not presented in a cohesive manner yet there is a link that connects all of them. I had to think at many times about the link but it is not hard to discern it.<br />I said this before and I will plead viewers to see it on a Blu Ray because the scenes are breathtaking and deserve to be seen on this format.<br />This was a good movie with many talented actors playing many roles throughout the ages. Tom Hanks by the way is the most famous of them.<br />Cloud Atlas has been panned because of the length and story telling but while it may not be a bonafide classic, it is still a good film.  four stars 8/12/2013sixth and final story, \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After\\" takes place in a time beyond the 22nd century when  tribesman (Tom Hanks) befriends a woman (Halle Berry) who belongs to a technologically advanced culture.<br />All these story are not presented in a cohesive manner yet there is a link that connects all of them.

B00AFEXRME|4.0|Whip Whitaker ( Denzel Washington) is a high-functioning alcoholic, and  a commercial  pilot, a man who is routinely flies planes drunk . So routinely drunk on a rainy morning he manages the impossible that is to save the life of many people.  Robert Zemeckis has made films in the past which have ordinary folks in extraordinary events and this film is no exception.<br />Denzel Washington is simply superb as Whip right from the start to the end and delivers one of his more memorable performances in recent years. Robert Zemeckis also makes a return to live action fter years of animation and displays why he is one of the best in the business.<br />The crash scene is very scary and well directed and makes you wonder about the sobriety about pilots ( not that they all drink before flying). I would not recommend watching this film just before you are going to catch a flight.<br />The story is not about a functional alcoholic hero but his journey afterwards as federal investigations reveal that Whip was drunk and that caused the crash and Whips  insistence that the plane was faulty. This clash of facts and opinion make the film watchable.<br />The film is about an addicts insistence that they are not having a problem with drinking. Kelly Reilly as Nicole, a woman on a downward spiral through addiction who meets Whip in the hospital is great and so is John Goodman as Whips drug dealer- I felt that his role should have been more developed. Don Cheadle is good as the lawyer.<br />Denzel Washington is the heart of the movie from the beginning to the end. Almost 60 he looks great and gives us one of his best performances in recent times. Flight is a great film about the pitfalls of addiction and consequences and the power of honesty. 8/22/2013

It is so much more enjoyable with the excellent narration by David LeDoux.  It has made all the difference in the world for me.  It brought the characters to life and made it easy to keep track of the multitude of details in this interesting (but hard to read) novel.  I was able to see/hear what a good story it really is.

B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Original:<br />This device is not able to maintain a charge of \\"My\\" Galaxy S4 while using navigation.  Your mileage may differ.  I started my trip with about 80% of my battery and arrived with 67%.  And yes the phone did report that it had a power source and trip was about 50 minutes.<br /><br />If I cannot charge my phone while using GPS, it is not useful to me.  True it did slow down the charge drain.  But still draining is bad.  It did charge the phone if I was not using it.  But slowly.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I was contacted by Anker.  They suggested to try a new/different USB cable to connect to my Galaxy S4.  I did try that, it did quit discharging during use, but the charge only added approximately 1% in an hour while in use for Bluetooth & GPS.  But I also realized that it worked much better in my Honda Accord than in a little Chevy rental car.  So my problem may have been partly the fault of the car and cable.<br /><br />They have offered to replace it, but I haven't been home long enough to process that.  Now that I am home for more than two weeks, I intend to follow up with them.<br /><br />Customer service has been prompt and courteous, my traveling has been the cause of length of time in working with them.<br /><br />Final update (1/11/14).  I received a 24 watt Anker charger and it seems to works well.  Phone charges much more steadily than the first charger.  I recommend the 24 watt Anker charger Note: original order was for the 18 watt, which would work well I think for a less power hungry device than a Galaxy S4.<br /><br />Customer Service was very good and much faster than I was able to respond.

For fans of the Night of the Living Dead which has tons of core I believe there is plenty of other eye catching entertainment for you; such as the what I call the zombie ladder or the fact that zombies turn in 12 seconds then get up and run like a sprint runner. The effects were well done and realistic. Bravo Brad!!!

630542845X|4.0|The unusually controversial 90s cult classic Powder is one of those films that works best when the audience watches it knowing little about it. Powder is a beautiful and touching picture with serious artistic value and imagery, but it also gives you plenty to think about as its credits roll. I'll get into all of that later on in this review, and I promised myself that I wouldn't get too into the messiness of the behind-the-scenes antics that have gone on. It is a magnificent film in a lot of ways, and I truly love it. However, I highly recommend that nobody read the IMDB message boards for the film and it's director. If I had the ability, I would tell the world that director Victor Salva is a completely different person than who he used to be, and for people to just move on. His behind-the-scenes drunken behavior on the set of his theatrical debut Clownhouse was unacceptable, and I'm not denying that. It was completely disgusting what he did and I doubt I'll ever have the respect for him as a person as I do as an artist, but I'm not going to go into detail about it here and publicize it any more than it already has been. It's not the kind of thing I like to talk about when I talk about films that I love. That's the only problem this film technically has, however, despite the fact that nothing like that took place behind the scenes of this film. The film has been forever tainted because of the man who made it. People hate the director. People cannot seem to separate the fiction of this film from the reality of the director, and so they'll find questionable material here to gawk over and re-examine despite the fact that none of those ideas existed in the film in the first place.<br /><br />Two novels that I love are The Education of Little Tree by Asa Earl \\"Forrest\\" Carter and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. Those books were written by people who I cannot, in good conscience, call anything other than scumbags. However, they were both able to write beautiful novels all the same. At least director Victor Salva was convicted of his crimes and did the time that was required of him. Sure, there will be people out there who say that nothing can ever change the fact that he did what he did, and I totally agree. Nothing can, so lets move on because all you're doing is making the people who suffered out to be nothing more than victims. People are too quick to see them as nothing more than victims. I don't think that a lot of folks realize just how tough it can be to be called a victim for your entire life, and if people would just smarten up and realize that these sorts of bad things happen all the time, they would realize that the true measure of a man is how fast they can pick themselves back up. People who label Victor Salva as nothing more than a monster are simply slowing down the process, and I feel the same way about those who label people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen as similar things. Folks, just please move on. There's nothing more that you can call him that he hasn't been called, and guess what. He's still making films. Not only that, but he's making good films. In my opinion, his best film is Powder.<br /><br />Anyway, Powder tells the story of an electromagnetic albino boy named Jeremy Reed who is nicknamed \\"Powder\\" (Sean Patrick Flanery) due to his pale complexion. Powder spent his childhood in the basement of his grandparents reading and re-reading every single book he could manage to get his hands on. By the time he was discovered by the public, he had learned so much but had yet to try and survive in the outside world. Things don't go so well for him as he ends up becoming an outcast to society at large. He is misunderstood almost constantly by his peers. His one brave attempt to make them laugh or even smile falls flat. He is bullied at his reform school almost relentlessly and is shunned by the people around him accept for the sheriff (Lance Henriksen), a psychologist (Mary Steenburgen), and his physics professor (Jeff Goldblum). Eventually it is established that Powder has unique, almost messiah-like abilities and a level of intelligence far beyond any human being in existence. It may be possible that Powder is simply a lost soul whose innocence and purity has been corrupted by this angry and complicated world full of people who are simply afraid of themselves and afraid to take any chances. People like to adapt to habits and hobbies in order to try and define themselves and shield themselves from the public out of fear for the people around them to find out who they really are. This film is simply about a man who is unable to hide who he is from the public and cannot adapt to rituals and hobbies like everyone else can, and therefore he becomes victimized by a harsh and unforgiving world that refuses to even make an attempt to try and understand him. Powder is a man who is born an irreversible non-conformist.<br /><br />Powder is basically a fable, not unlike films such as Edward Scissorhands or Danny Deckchair. To me, however, it is a film that was ahead of its time and will not be able to be fully appreciated by anyone other than those who take the entire film on its own merits. Even for those people, however, there will be some challenges. The film is a lot like Powder, the character. I'm going to be honest. This film's magic did not work on me the first time I viewed it. I thought it was an enjoyable film, but I was also young and it didn't fully resonate with me. Sure, many of the images certainly stuck with me and I found the film to be quite emotional, but I couldn't really see past what made the whole thing so damn exceptional other than the fact that there was a lot of passion and emotion involved in the picture itself. The scene with the deer made me cry when I was little, but I didn't really understand why. This is the kind of film that obeys a lot of pretty typical genre conventions, but then has moments of terrifying realism, not unlike the film Monster's Ball, that made the whole picture very bizarre, surprising, and disturbing. It's sort of like Werner Herzog's Invincible, only without the unbelievable heartache and tragedy. Powder is a much more misunderstood and unhappy character, but never once does he just let his own situations get the better of him. He feels weak and damaged, but that's only because he is. Powder is meant to be portrayed lightly as a kind of messiah, but this isn't so that small-minded viewers can pretend that Victor Salva was trying to paint a portrait of Jesus Christ and all of his glory. Salva directed the film this way because he wanted to craft a metaphor for Powder being a misunderstood man like Jesus Christ was, because lets face it. Who was more misunderstood than Jesus Christ? Abraham Lincoln? Michael Jackson? I think not. To me, if you're going to make a film about a selfless human being, you need to go all the way in showing how helpless man can become as it progresses through its many turmoils. Powder is too pure for this world, and may always will be. This is why this film worked so damn well to me, because it was lightly traumatic and emotional and it didn't pour it all on screen for people to gawk at and hail it as a masterpiece when it's really a freak show. The film approaches the material with a fearlessness, but also with a sense of tactfulness. This is a film made up of small moments in order to convey a story with a lot of heart, passion, and humanity. I was very moved by it.<br /><br />Powder is a powerful and quiet film for me, but it doesn't try to overstay it's welcome either. There are a lot of ideas in this film that are put forth, and many people may be frustrated by the fact that the film doesn't take the time to explore a lot of it. People have a similar problem with the Ken Russell film Altered States. I think that, in general, if you can at least establish the essence of what is going on and make the viewer at least feel that they are getting the chance to explore such heavy material that it doesn't matter to me if it works completely. For me, I appreciated the fact that this film brought so many ideas to the table without trying to dwell on them. This film wasn't meant to be like Sphere, which I personally found to be scary but which many people found to be preachy. Powder certainly isn't preachy, but it can be misconstrued for being that way due to the fact that it has it's occasional moments where it will dwell on certain characters and events. Many folks like to bring up a scene in which Powder passionately watches a young teen wring his wet shirt over his body and claim it to be homoerotic when in reality it is supposed to symbolize the fact that Powder doesn't have any bodily hair on him and wishes that he could have experienced what it would have been like to grow up and develop hair in various places on the body, which was a time in the lives of many adolescent boys that was unpleasant and unnerving. Ironically, the character of Powder is also judged after being witnessed gawking at the boy. I think that's one of the most challenging aspects of the film for a lot of people. There's an ominous temptation to read into aspects of the film that don't actually exist. There always will be with a Victor Salva film, and because of this I don't think that many people will unfortunately be able to ever comprehend how truly deep and powerful this film really is. However, the ending to Powder has an element of optimism to it. Powder is too pure and too innocent for this world to accept him, but the characters that surround him hold out hope that there is a place for someone like him to go where he will never be judged or harassed for who he is. I too hold out hope that one day people will accept this film and not judge it by the people attached to it. I accept the fact that people will do that and still won't like the film, and that's fine. However, I didn't like the film either when I was younger, and I didn't know anything about was Salva did. This film did much more than grow on me though. It moved me deeply.
B005544V6A|5.0|Show is awesome! USA always has great chemistry between actors. I hate amazon right now because I just wanted to click the stars.
B0009VRHLK|3.0|It has taken me eight years to be able to even begin to embrace this film. I've disliked this film immensely for the past several years, and when I re-watched it recently to be able to properly write this review, I dragged my feet on the ground until I wore a hole in my shoe. My sister warned me it was awful, but I didn't heed her warning. The first time I ever saw it was when it came out on DVD. It was unavailable at most video stores, and the ones that did carry it tended to always have their copies rented out, and most other stores just stuck it in the ADULT section. Being underage, that would've made renting it out from those stores impossible, so I ended up just buying the DVD from a local Borders. I was about sixteen years old at the time, but luckily I knew the clerk who sold it to me. He was (and still very much is) a queer like me who knew I was always on the prowl for challenging films with intense subject matter. I also knew that he hated this film but really was eager to know what I thought about it. I had seen Buffalo '66 prior to this and loved it, and I was already familiar with Vincent Gallo as an actor with films like The Funeral and Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trickbaby. When I sat down and watched The Brown Bunny, I was completely put off by Gallo apparently just like most moviegoers who saw the picture tended to be. The Brown Bunny is an infuriating experience, full of awkward scenarios of uncomfortable and, frankly, inhuman behavior that resembles the worst and the most banal aspects of everyday reality. I remember telling my Borders friend exactly those words. Oh boy did I hate this film. Sitting through it was so difficult for me, in fact, that I ended up injuring my right shoulder due to how much I was cringing and squirming throughout. I had to remove all of my clothing because the picture was making me feel like I was about to have an anxiety attack. If there is one thing that I can safely say about The Brown Bunny, it's among one of the most difficult films to actively sit through. If you're going into it thinking it'll JUST be a meditative, hypnotic experience that puts a microscope above everyday human behavior, prepare to be greatly disappointed. This film is deliberately pessimistic, angry, creepy, and emotionally and staggeringly hateful. Just about the only kind words to say about it is that its more light-hearted and more entertaining than Gus Van Sant's Gerry. This was my reaction the first time I viewed The Brown Bunny.<br /><br />Since 2005, when I first viewed The Brown Bunny, I have watched the picture six times. That's five more times than I've seen Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. To put that into a more honest perspective, I've seen Atom Egoyan's Felicia's Journey roughly around twelve or thirteen times, all of these viewing in the span of a good two years when I was utterly obsessed with the movie. I've watched the William Hurt film The King about eighteen times total. I've attempted to watch Gosford Park about ten different times. I still haven't finished it. The point is, I love to re-watch strange art films that are difficult to swallow. The stranger the better. I can hardly wait to re-watch Wendy and Lucy, which to me is a similarly troubling film that I reacted very similarly to as I did The Brown Bunny. The Brown Bunny is one film that I have a difficult time re-watching. I've only ever watched it by myself, which is honestly probably the best way to watch it I feel. Every time I've watched it, it puts me through the emotional ringer. There's nothing that makes me more uncomfortable than emotional dysfunction, I've come to realize upon my latest re-watch. The Brown Bunny is not only a film about that, but it also explores it in what could be the most horrific way to explore material like this. Each time I've viewed this film, I've appreciated it slightly more and more. The first time I viewed this film, obviously as you can tell from above, I hated every aspect of it. Couldn't even begin to appreciate any element or scene of it. To me, it was just one big embarrassment. I refuse to call the picture a vanity project. A vanity project implies that the end result holds some sort of beauty, whether subjective or objective, and I don't even think defenders of this film can say that the subject matter or the imagery of this film isn't ugly. It's beautifully shot, sure, and it's beautifully presented, but do the ideas hold any kind of beauty to them? I don't know, I guess it depends on the person. The second time I watched it, I found the finale of the picture itself to be rewarding, but the fact that it takes place at the end of such an agonizing and humiliating experience of a film somehow made it feel futile to even begin to try and embrace. The third time I watched it, I was struck a lot more by the weight of the circumstances of the main character, Bud, who spends the whole movie driving his truck, occasionally stopping to re-visit and speak to acquaintances, drive his motorcycle, and have bizarre and cruel interactions with random females, before ultimately confronting an old girlfriend of his played by Chlöe Sevigny.<br /><br />The forth and fifth time, I found myself enjoying more and more of the hypnotic imagery. The sixth time, I found the combination of long, meditative shots and intense emotional quality to be more interesting, but couldn't get past the dry atmosphere. The seventh time I watched it, I began to understand its darker elements a lot more, but was still put off by the sheer anger of the presentation. Now I've seen it again, back in late July of 2013. I am now starting to truly realize why I have such a difficult time with the picture, and why it is such a brilliant work of art. Make no mistake, the experience of The Brown Bunny is one that gets me shaking with fear, but now I can properly put into words what specifically makes it so off-putting and ugly. Vincent Gallo very much bared his heart and soul into this picture, and the reason why I initially rejected it is because I, along with many other men out there, have a deep personal fear of showing emotion and showing any sort of fragility. This is a film that explores the inherent weakness in men in the most personal way possible. It is a film that explores why masculinity will truly be the death of us all. I am ashamed to really say this, but as of writing this I am in my mid-twenties and I still sometimes feel like I've never grown up and am afraid that I never will. What does it mean to grow up? Who we have in this film is Bud, and I think the film makes it fairly obvious that he has not grown up nor does he have the mind of a typical adult. I think his behavior in this film is mostly childish, and he still very much shows a genuine fear of women through all the weird and disturbing behavior he exhibits throughout the story. He loved his ex-girlfriend Daisy (Chlöe Sevigny) so much because she represented someone who could actually take care of him and raise him like some kind of child still. He could act and behave like an adult, and even be in love with her and find her attractive and would even be willing to engage in sexual intercourse, but when it came to having a healthy relationship with no strings attached and no complications, he was a genuine failure. That's what makes the finale so heart pounding to me. He is completely lost and aimless in this world without another woman to take care of him. He is, I'm afraid, representative of many of the men out there. Many men haven't truly grown up and feel the need to have a woman in their life because they feel that's the only way that they can have any sort of guidance. Unfortunately, in the case of Bud, Daisy was a drug addict and was extremely self-destructive, and that's why this film is so troubling. We're watching a despicable man pursue an interaction with a woman who we all know is not healthy for him, and his understated obsession with her is what makes this filmso deeply disturbing and difficult to sit through for me. I can think of hundreds of films that are all about the loneliness of the road and how much of a lie the American dream is, but I cannot think of as many films that are so damn bitter about it as this one is. If it were starring a woman and directed by a woman, critics and audiences would embrace it and celebrate it because that's what they expect. Here, the only thing that gets exploited in The Brown Bunny is Vincent Gallo himself. Even in the infamous hardcore blowjob scene, it is Sevigny who is very much in power and in control. Gallo spends the entire film laying bare everything that is physically wrong with himself. His large chin, his lanky frame, his high-pitched voice, his birdlike scowl, all are on display for about 75% of the film's runtime, and in the end he ultimately is exploring the idea of how it is the weakness of men and their libidos and their constant desire to adhere to tradition and dignity that has destroyed America the most. He presents this idea in the most non-elegant way possible. He paints a portrait of a man who cannot accept death or the idea of someone dying, and it is that kind of inability to move on that leads to the destruction of the human soul and the degradation of the human body.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Bud is a scumbag. The women he picks up throughout the film all look and appear angelic. I'll give you one example of how painful this film is. The first girl, a teenager, has a striking resemblance to many girls that I know and grew up with. She has simplistic facial features. She is one of the most realistic looking girls I've seen in film. Her facial features have an unusual kind of beauty to them. Bud, with his creepy facial features, gets her to fall in love with him by showing a vulnerable, scared side of himself. He plays a different character, essentially. Then he ditches her at her home after he convinces her to quit her job and run inside to get clothes for the road. The scene is one of the scariest scenes in the film, for you almost fear that she'll run out of her home and see Bud drive away. The look on her face, in your mind, will be a look of tragic disappointment and shame. Luckily, she doesn't come running out, however, her face continues to haunt you for you just know that she'll look upset and sad, and seeing such a cute face with such crushed disappointment is an uncomfortable and utterly maddening feeling. You start to wish she had so that you could at least have a look of disappointment that doesn't match the horror you picture in your mind. It's almost as if the sadness of the scene itself could never match the tragedy your mind conjures up. That is, I feel, where the true horror of the film lies. It's the Taxi Driver syndrome. The feeling of wishing to see graphic images so that you can take your mind off of the image in your head of a character you care about crying and having an emotional breakdown. As powerful as this film is, The Brown Bunny will always be an uncomfortable, awkward, and creepy experience and always will be. The Brown Bunny is basically the Merchant-Ivory version of The Passion of the Christ. Both could be viewed by some as pornographic pictures that exploit the men rather than the woman. The only difference is that The Passion is slightly more S&M-themed.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it. Excellent acting, a good story, and it was well shot. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|After opening in an appropriately Fulci-like manner, Evil Dead unfolds in a way that feels very unlike an everyday horror picture. The film wisely chooses to sidestep modern instruments and devices in order to establish a sort of timeless quality. None of the characters are typically attractive, none of them dress in flamboyant clothing or wear shirts with logos. None of the characters use cell phones or wear fancy wristwatches. What I was impressed with, however, about this approach was how the film avoids turning these characters into bland caricatures. Instead, what we have is a film full of non-stereotypical, likable people who never once overstay their welcome nor feel out of place. They are young, they make some big mistakes, and they definitely don't all survive, but aside from all that this is perhaps the freshest group of horror film characters I've seen in quite some time! We have a brother and sister (the sister is a depressed drug addict, the brother is despondent to her, though attempting not to be), we have the brother's girlfriend (who essentially plays the role Bruce Campbell played in the original, only as a female) we have a sassy college friend (whose curiosity and fearlessness, unfortunately, get him into trouble) and we have a practicing nurse (and my favorite character out of the five) who all come across as legitimate friends, and not people who just barely met one another. They share the same space in a manner that doesn't come across as overtly irksome nor fratboy-like. These aren't like the characters in Cabin Fever who make too many spontaneous decisions that end up furthering and furthering their ultimate downfall. We aren't left with the biggest jerk in the picture being the smartest individual. No, this film, to me, is this year's Splinter. We are given characters who make bold decisions and actually get rewarded for them! Perhaps not as often as in Splinter, but certainly often enough that we are kept captivated. Now let me ask you, how many horror films can you think of that were made after the 1970s that do that? Not even the original Evil Dead film did that. Don't get me wrong, this film does not top the original. It lacks the energy and the gleeful wacky unpredictability that it not only featured by also celebrated. However, what it DOES have is a serious and creative level of suspense and horror with a good helping of respect for what the original film did so well. Its not a better film by any means, but it is more well made and it is just as scary.<br /><br />One of the things I really appreciate, also, about this remake is how it never oversteps its own boundaries. Evil Dead lacks style, which the original film is full of and one of the things that makes the original film so relentless and horrifying. However, it more than makes up for it in its characterizations. This is a much more character-driven film than the original. Evil Dead is still an exercise in horror, gore, and depravity first and foremost, so don't expect a Quentin Tarantino-level of character development. Don't even expect a Rob Zombie-level of character development. You are watching the wrong film if you are expecting another Rosemary's Baby or an Inside. This is, by no means, that kind of movie. The best way to explain this would be, funnily enough, to describe Roger Ebert's statements on my DVD of Dark City. At one point he is describing a shot that takes place inside of a police station. The police station is incredibly full of details, characters, and wild imagery, none of which is important because it is only one shot and its the only scene that takes place inside of that part of the police station. There is no reason for there to be so much detail other than that they just simply could. THAT is why I love this film so much. We are treated to gorgeous shots of the woods while its draining. Pipes are leaky, the walls are clumpy with mud and rust, the ceiling looks like its going to cave in in some shots. None of thesedetails are useful in the least and none of them have any sort of impact on the disturbing events that occur over the course of the picture, but to me those little unnecessary details help give the film the push that it needs to really allow the film to breathe and not be overshadowed by the original. Some of those little details (such as the look of the necklace or the infamous violation sequence in the woods) are little more than homages to the original film's iconic images, but none of it draws any unnecessary attention. Even moreso, some of the most memorable parts of this film are the parts that were never any part of the original. Not to mention that this film makes full use of how claustrophobic the woods can be and how creepy a location like that is, being isolated out in the middle of the wilderness away from civilization. Unlike the original, however, this film doesn't take any inspiration from The Three Stooges. The isolation feels less like a divisive maneuver by the filmmakers to keep the characters in one location. The turn of events that cause the characters to get stuck isn't a permanent hinderance. Unfortunately, however, these characters are smart and don't know that they are in a horror film, which is why they don't just outright leave.<br /><br />Perhaps what I love the most about this film, however, is the fact that its actually scary. I haven't mentioned the gore or anything that really happens in it, and thats because I think it is honestly better to be surprised by that kind of thing. I watched this and I didn't know who was going to live or die, who was going to make a bad decision, who was going to make a good decision, where those decisions would lead, or what would even happen if they succeeded or failed. This is a film that actually genuinely terrified me. There were at least four moments where I really wasn't even able to look at the screen. There are very few fake jump scares (I HATE fake jump scares. Wishmaster had the worst fake jumpscare ever) and often times when I did jump it would usually be for a honest reason, such as something painful taking place on screen or a monster jumping out and attacking a character. There is the prototypical \\"homage-to-Hitchcock\\" shot, though this time around the payoff is quite punishing and petrifying. The monsters are scary as hell (though not quite as effective as they were in the original even though they definitely look more realistic and threatening) and when they appear it is really never not scary. There is generally little humor in this film, and where there is it is very gallows humor. The overall atmosphere of the film is dark and dreary and the characters rarely look happy. Most of the dialogue of the film, like Martyrs, consists of screaming, shrieking, and yelling. The film is loud, but never punishingly so. The gore is extreme but never gratuitous (at least in my opinion). There is one moment in the film that even made me tear up. Overall, Evil Dead is, in my opinion, a fantastic film. Keep in mind that I went into it putting the original out of my mind. I had only seen the trailer and the poster for this film. I avoided reviews, I didn't ask my friends who saw it how good or bad it was, and I went into it with the purpose of viewing it as its own film that wasn't a part of any franchise, and thats honestly how I try to go into every horror remake. If you're going into this expecting to hate it or thinking it won't top the original, you're not going to like it much. Simple as that. People need to give horror remakes an honest chance, because I think its preventing people from truly enjoying genuinely good horror films and its blinding people to the qualities of remakes like this. As it stands, to me, this is one of the best horror remakes since John Carpenter's The Thing.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Got a lot of great tips out of this book, and plan on putting them to good use.  It's a great starting point if you're even thinking about publishing via Kindle, so I highly recommend that you read this before you start so you can format first, then continue writing.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|i have not ever loathed something i liked this much.  the writing is excellent.  ideas and images are conveyed beautifully and it is very apparant why this story has endured.  but it is sooooooo long winded and tends to dwell on trival points so much that it takes years to get through this novel and it is a wonder why it has endured for so long.  i guess in the end it is worth reading...but make sure you have other things to read throughout when you get bored with the story.    update 12/22/2014:  finally finished completely.  at the heart of it is a story about a convict trying to gain forgiveness, which after many, many, many long-winded and ecruciatingly detailed explanations and backstories, he is finally able to do at the moment before his peaceful passing away.  not a book for the coffee table.  not for a leisurely read.  i had originally given 3 stars due to the difficulty in traversing the french songs, and the asides.  but the end ties up nicely and even has a sort of \\"happily ever after\\" feeling.
B000INAXGU|5.0|I don't know much about these guys, but they jam.  If you grew up in the 1970s, you will probably like this CD.  It has driving funk beats, great vocals and  jazz chord progressions.  I'm diggin' it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|There are some strange songs about going along for a ride to outer space. [[ASIN:B00137QQAW Mr. Spaceman]]. [[ASIN:B000SXM5WK Space Oddity (1999 Digital Remaster)]]. [[ASIN:B00137ZQOO Spaceman]]. Harry Nilsson came to the conclusion that going round and round is just a lot of lunacy:<br /><br />Hey, Mother Earth, won't you bring me back down<br />safely to the sea?<br /><br />The patrols of a future Earth in which the people have been taken away for their own safety after a nuclear battle against space invaders involves some memories that have been sanitized. That kind of plot makes me suspect some connections to reality that make the movie worth watching to see what people can remember that was worth knowing when this was our planet. On a scale from stillborn to born with a brain, another day in paradise can seem as stupid as social reality seems to me.
B008JFUNTG|5.0|finally after 2 and a half years we finally get the sea of monsters movie based on the novel by Rick Riordan. this movie stuck quite closely to the book than the lightning thief did. i loved how everbody looked a year older just like in the books because after each book a year has passed. once again i loved all the cool scenes with percy and glover they were done very well and there is are bad guy Luke which i throught was so cool. this is another great family film to share and enjoy for years to come. cant wait for 2015 for the titans curse movie so excited.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Blake Crouch blew this one out of the water!  This book was very hard to put down. You feel as if you are there with Ethan as he tries to unravel the mystery behind this quaint little town of Wayward Pines. Soon as i had read this book, Crouch released the second part, &#34;Wayward Pines&#34;.  Guess what, i have aleady read it too!  He is working on a third book for release in 2014.

B008Y6YCB0|3.0|We enjoyed this movie (almost 4*) but our enjoyment was offset by slow delivery, sometimes difficult to understand dialog and character relationships. Some of the banter is very entertaining. Not bad if you are looking for something different.
1476729719|5.0|This book was very well written. The subject, a school shooting, pulled you in and I couldn't put it down. The characters are interesting and the end was a good surprise. I would recommend reading it.
B00DK9FNLY|5.0|I read all the hysterical reviews and decided to give this game a try anyway.  I find that it runs well on my tablet and I haven't noticed any obtrusive ads. I've only played a few games and even managed to win one although I'm no expert.  I think people should give this game a try and and evaluate it on its own merits instead of allowing a bunch of paranoid folk to discourage them.  It's fun!
0446310786|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I read it in a weekend. I had to read it for a school assignment and it was wonderful! I highly suggest reading it, if you haven't. The characters were incredible and I fell in love with little Scout. I would read this book over and over again.
B005F2BBLK|2.0|Movie has little going for it except the animation.<br />Story line weak, characters poorly developed.<br />Waste of energy, even for a child.

It's rock and roll that you can dance to with a blusey downbeat that moves you. These guys are having fun making music and they bring you along for the ride. The drummer is outta sight, the bass gets your bottom going and the guitar shreds! The singer, Ty, has amazing vocals, kinda gritty, kinda smooth...all kinds of great with a lotta action! I can't help but feel good when I listen to this band. Gotta be a \\"Troublemaker\\"! (That's what their fans are called) Can't wait for their next release!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Reading is sometimes like a treasure hunt. You read one book, which leads you to another book, and then another, and finally you find the treasure. That is the way I feel after reading \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\".<br /><br />This book has a timeless feel to it. It could have been written one hundred years ago, or ten, or perhaps yesterday. The story unfolds slowly allowing it to seep into your bones. Even now, I'm thinking about Margaret, and the twins, and John-the-Dig, and Shadow.<br /><br />In \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" are references to other books. Right now I'm reading \\"The Woman in White\\" which I'd not heard of before. You see what I mean about a treasure hunt!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you've read and loved the first four entries in Martin's series, you will not be disappointed with the fifth. Martin begins the story at roughly the same point in time that &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34; began, but with different characters so that we can explore the story that was left out in the last entry. Eventually the timeline moves past that point, and we see how certain plot archs that were established in AFFC begin to play out. That said, very few, if any, major plot lines become clearer, let alone resolved, so this novel will leave you hungry and waiting for the next one. The stories are also not very action-oriented and revolve more around the &#34;game of thrones&#34; than the combat and conquest we've seen before. Other reviews discuss disappointment in the perceived shortcomings of book 5 of this epic series, but it is definitely not one to miss, especially if you've enjoyed previous volumes.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Although I am not a big fan of Martin Sheen, he gave an impressive performance as General Lee.  Tom Berenger portrays the role of Longstreet admirably.  Jeff Bridges, probably one of the most diverse actors of his generation plays a great adaptation of Chamberlain. The movie is a good rendition of “Killer Angels”.  If you haven’t seen the movie, I recommend watching it first then reading the book.  You won’t be disappointed.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|An intense story set in the sunny southern resorts of Spain. Jimmy Walker moves away to Spain with the intention of getting clean but soon becomes embroiled in the seedy underworld that haunts the popular Spanish resorts. A thrill ride of a story that takes you into a world filled with hardcore drugs and even harder criminals. I would love to see a director such as  Guy Ritchie pick up on this book as I would make for an excellent  movie. The scary thing about this book is it could so easily be true.

B00E9P959O|5.0|Full disclosure:  I am largely opposed to post-release tinkering of any work, be it movie, book or music.  I think that if an artist is going to tinker with a previous work, they had better have extremely good reasons, and the tinkering had better be a clear improvement that leaves the integrity of the original work intact.  The best cases are the ones that have corrected clear mistakes or compensated for unwelcome tinkering done to the original work in the first place - \\"Blade Runner\\" is the poster-boy example of this.  But most tinkerings fail badly by either bloating the work with unnecessary filler or introducing elements that simply don't belong.  Think the \\"Star Wars\\" so-called Special Editions, or just about any Director's Cut that adds deleted footage back in - it was usually deleted for a good reason in the first place.  Tight editing appears to be a lost art with some directors.  In music, Def Leppard's recent re-recordings are clearly motivated by business, and they don't do the original classic recordings any justice.<br /><br />So here's Rush, with a 2002 album that is readily acknowledged by any discriminating listener as having received a below-average mastering.  The original album is muddy and incoherent, especially for those of us used to the crisp, precise sound of this band in previous recordings.  So the first condition is easily satisfied:  a poor mastering job is a great reason to revisit a work.  So all that remains is:  does the new edition do justice to the original work while simultaneously providing an improvement that even a purist would welcome?<br /><br />Gratefully, the answer is YES.  Finally, \\"Vapor Trails\\" truly sounds like a Rush album, with crystal-clear production values that live up to the sonic standard Rush has set on so many previous recordings.  Just listen to the samples from this album compared to the samples from the original album, and the difference is immediately noticeable and most welcome.  I'm perfectly happy discarding my copy of the original album and replacing it with this copy, and that's saying a lot coming from someone like me who is a near-purist.  Do not hesitate to pick this up just because it's a revised work - it is well worth it and is the rare revised work that really works.  Frankly this is the album that should have been released in the first place.rding my copy of the original album and replacing it with this copy, and that's saying a lot coming from someone like me who is a near-purist.

B002WV5A9G|5.0|I really love this movie.  My birthday was on 09 27 and I wanted something pleasing and good to watch, so I got this. what a treat it was.  I really love it. and the instant rental streamed very well, no hick ups on my first viewing it.  However, the second time I watched I had to endure consistently pauses while the video loaded and streamed.  The movie, I think, is way greater than the second instalment.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I'm not too familiar with FF, but this story is told quite differently from others of this type, so was especially great reading. Fast but well paced, enough detail and realistic scenarios.  Unlike many of this genre, there was no obvious 'political message' embedded.  I liked it V, V much.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend because  it had a male protagonist. Other than that she told me nothing. Just like the book I got no information and was thrust into the story. It's full of mystery, and the way it unfolds makes you really feel like your part of the story as well. A quick read. I would recommend for any person 12 or older.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I use this on a Sony Xperia Tipo - which is quite a small screen and I need glasses to read it. The original key positions don't seem to be quite as accurately placed compared to an iPhone say and it's easy to hit the wrong key.<br /><br />Well the SwiftKey app makes creating texts so much easier. It seems to make more intelligent choices about the intended words than the original keyboard. I slide my finger in roughly the right directions to go over the keys I need and it picks up the right word almost all the time. When I lift my finger it inserts a space. It's a very speedy way to enter messages.<br /><br />When it gets a word wrong it is quite stubborn about changing it, you have to delete the word letter by letter.<br /><br />Well worth installing.

0062278096|5.0|This book is a good way to feed your need for new Sherlock - which any fan of the show is clearly hungry for more.  This will distract you enough for a few days to keep your desires at bay.<br /><br />It's really fun and interesting and they did it right.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Again, I love this show.  I bought both seasons' CD's.  If you love country music you will love this CD and should try to watch the show if you get the opportunity.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show is so addicting!  I started watching at Season 5 so I am thankful that I can start from the beginning thanks to my Amazon Prime account
B00948EPOQ|5.0|Great way to incorporate views of Paris and a history of Paris and expat American and other artists and writers.
B002NUULNG|5.0|If you haven't seen Ghost in the Shell yet, get it. It's a must for any Anime far, or for anyone starting to get into Anime. It's a classic, period.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you haven't seen the game of thrones HBO series, you're are missing out. I wish they could have released the 2nd season in a special edition box set. Since I have the 1st one like that. It's a must own for any fan of the tv show.

B0031RS64G|2.0|I just can't get into this book. This was the second time I borrowed it form the library, with a steel determination to finish it this time. First time I reached page 80. This time i went so far as to reach the half. And again failure. I don't even know why this one book can't keep me interested. It's not about the details, or the characters; i have read Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time which is full of unnecessary descriptions and MANY characters, so it's not about that. Maybe this is just not my book. We can't like everything, can we?
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|not what we thought it was going to be like, unexpected surprise, held my breath more than once during movie!
B000W7JWUA|3.0|Maybe it was because I just played it, but I didn't really see what was so great about the game. I'll continue to play it and see how I feel about it. So far, meh.
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Not a hugeTrekkie but this movie has to be one of my all time favorites, they did a fantastic job.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|In his opinion the Judeo-Christian &#34;God&#34; exists.  In his opinion, prayer is heard.  In his opinion, there is a Heaven.  In his opinion, the cerebral cortex was not stimulated and did not have hallucinations when he was in a coma.  Never was that verified as fact.  It cannot be verified as fact that there is a Judeo-Christian God either.  Maybe it's The Great Spirit.  Maybe it's the Force.  Maybe there is no God.  It all is a matter of &#34;faith&#34; and once you have to have faith that something is real, that stretches provable fact to the unbelievable limit.<br /><br />IF the cerebral cortex was not stimulated, and it is not just his opinion that it was not, please prove that.  Please state the facts that statement is based upon.  This was not done.<br /><br />Therefore, in a nutshell, it is not proof of Heaven.  His experience is just so special because it happened to HIM.  And HE is a doctor.  So?  Why can't it matter just as much if someone is a garbage collector and has the same experience?  I found the arrogance off-putting.<br /><br />I know there is life after death because of my own NDE.  However, I did not find the verification in &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; I had hoped to find.  I wanted to find proof and there was none.

B00F7YHDWC|4.0|It's a great game but not perfect my reasons are that when you have to cover the blood holes it won't let you hold them all down also you can see the trains out side of the game but on the I pod that does not happen but other than that it's great
B00F91SCXC|3.0|This movie is entertaining, but there is really nothing new here. There is the same &#34;post zombie apocalypse&#34; plot that exists in several other movies played out.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|I've been skeptical of DT ever since Portnoy got the boot. Last album was good but not quite as good as I'd hope.<br /><br />So I was a bit nervous of this 1 one.<br /><br />Of course at first I didn't like it.<br /><br />BUT YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO A NEW DT ALBUM AT LEAST #-$ TIMES BEFORE YOU CAN PASS JUDGEMENT ON IT!!!<br /><br />So I followed that sound advice and I now LOVE this album. :D

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and realistic. Love the way it looks and sounds. Great for children and adults. Can't wait to u can have 2 horses in the pen
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Perks of Being a Wallflower.  This is also a coming of age book and it's beautifully written.  Quick read but could barely put it down.  Gripping from the beginning.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I loved hazel and Augustus character's. Augustus was so like able I instantly fell in love with his character. It was a beautiful story beautifully written.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was so amazing the way that everything fell in to place in the end.  I loved the epilogue!!! Sometimes you read a book and think what could have been - this actually did that for you.  I really thought that his secret was something totally different.  I really enjoyed this - suspense, romance, GREAT......

B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever seen. It deserves 20 stars. I didn't even know what it was it was about when I started watching it, which made it even better. I'll skip the synopsis, since most reviews have that covered. I watched most of the episodes on Netflix, then watched the others on cable, because Netflix didn't have all of them (surprise, surprise).<br /><br />What's so great about the show? It has a little bit of all of us in it. It's about love, hate, fear, indifference, greed, and lust. It's about kids. It's about corruption. It's about the contradiction between our internal and external selves. It's about sacrifice. It's about craziness. It's about money. It's about change. It's about being human, most of all.<br /><br />The acting is superb. I have never seen anything so realistic. It doesn't seem like acting at all. There's a lot of dark humor underlying the tragedy as well. It reminds me a lot of the movie Fargo. My favorite actor in the show is the lawyer, Saul Goodman. He is the ultimate stereotypical shady lawyer, though his outward appearance suggests the exact opposite: from his name, to the tacky inflatable Statue of Liberty on his office building, to the Constitution mural in his office. He's as crooked as a three dollar bill, and hysterically funny. I look forward to his Breaking Bad spinoff show.<br /><br />Finally, I also loved the fact that the show didn't last forever. So many good shows have been ruined by wearing out their welcome on TV (CSI and American Idol come to mind). Every show has a limited life cycle, no matter how good they are. Going out with a bang is always the best strategy, IMO.
B00594XOZU|2.0|Well I love the app and it worked perfectly fine but lately I've been trying to log in and it won't  let me I logged out to go on my other account and it didn't work so I thought I'll just lift in to my original and it didn't work so then I tried making a new one still not working this is a problem and I don't no what happened but they need to be viewing these reviews
B008C20TDG|5.0|Dallas and Melissa's book really is an eye opener when it comes to how the food you eat really affects your body. Whilst I had read about the Paleo way of eating online for the past year, It Starts with Food really explained everything I wanted to know in depth. Bring on doing a Whole 30 and getting my body back to it's natural state. Thank you for such an amazing book.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Amazing! This is one monster release. Serious Deadheads already know this show and have been requesting it for official release for what seems to be forever. And for good reason. For those that have several of the Europe '72 shows, you know what I am talking about when I say that this sits with the best of them.<br /><br />From the opening number 'The Promised Land', the band are in tight and unbelievably relaxed form. Weir mentions at different intervals as to the heat of that day in Veneta, Oregon. I can't understand how the band can play so well in such heat (100+ degrees fahrenheit, 37+ degrees celcius).<br />There is an atmosphere at this show that makes me feel like I am there.<br /><br />The versions of nearly all of the tracks are quite brilliant. Plenty of 'established' fan's favourites are included in the set. I would imagine that many of the tracks would capture the attention of newcomers as well, based on the variance of the musical styles, and comfort the band explore & deliver within those styles. The jamming at different times is jazzy, calm, intense - altogether controlled and inspired at the same time as it is improvised. Their chemistry when they are in this form is sublime. They show how switched-on they are at this show. Infectious stuff.<br /><br />The China > Rider included here are amongst the best that I have heard. Playing In The Band is great. Dark Star - wow! The different moods contained within take you to another world. These tracks contain my favourite jamming on the album.<br /><br />Thankfully, the clarity of the vocals are a highlight on this - not forced, in key, well-harmonized, and heartfelt where needed. Sing Me Back Home is so good...<br /><br />This version of Greatest Story Ever Told is my favourite version. It clearly shows that the band are really enjoying themselves.<br /><br />The cowboy tunes work nicely.<br /><br />Overall, this album is best heard from head-to-toe in one sitting. Not only because of the musical content - the atmosphere of the show with the announcements etcetera is captured between the tracks as well.<br /><br />The DVD contains several uncut highlights including the 30+ minutes of Dark Star, the 'very special' rendition of China > Rider...and more. Although it doesn't contain the whole show, what you get is an excellent account of that magic day.<br /><br />Established fans: you know what you are getting. Spread the word!<br /><br />Newbies: this very well may introduce you to the (mostly) wonderful world of Grateful Dead live albums.<br /><br />Enjoy :-D- the atmosphere of the show with the announcements etcetera is captured between the tracks as well.<br /><br />The DVD contains several uncut highlights including the 30+ minutes of Dark Star, the 'very special' rendition of China > Rider...and more.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|i read the first book and had to get the second one to find out what happens next.  While reading, I get so into it, i'm exhausted from all the fighting scenes.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found myself wanting to skip forward for the first time in my life because I wasn't sure if I could wait to find out what was in Jon-Paul's letter that he didn't expect to be found until after his death (though the letter was found by his wife while he was out of town).  There are many stories within this story, and it was interesting how interconnected the lives were, and how so many little things changed the course of their collective histories over time.  I thought Moriarity did a good job depicting how people can be misunderstood, as well as misunderstand others BECAUSE they don't know their backgrounds, or won't open their eyes to see.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|i had seen the movie first, didn't know about the books. so after the movie i had to read the books.  wow! lots action packed.  love it.

B00B84652O|5.0|good box set of one of my favorite band around the world, the best cds of king diamond in one package
1592402038|4.0|It was not too terribly painful to read. Although, I was hoping to make it through life without ever having read a book on grammar. For a grammar book I enjoyed \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\". It's compact, clear, and the humor is a nice relief from a subject that isn't all that hedonic. The fight described in the beginning is interesting, especially as she rails on commas--- referring to them as \\"good old Comma the Sheepdog\\".<br /><br />I will say, Truss' style can be a bit overwhelming. I found myself wanting to skip over certain portions of the reading, due to the fact that she can be a bit excessive in making her point; so just be warned you may find yourself skim-reading because it creates a certain difficulty of concentrating efficiently. But honestly it's not a bad read at all, and I had an appreciation for lack of ostentatiousness from Truss. She doesn't pretend to have credentials in grammar beyond being a professional journalist, who paid attention in school. Everything she says comes from a place of passion, and I respect that.
B001UW58WW|5.0|Having seen David Garrett in concert locally, I am in love with him and his music. He is over the top fabulous as a musician and as a performer. All of the songs he plays are beautifully arranged and unique in sound. And for this grandmother, he is delightful &#34;eye candy&#34; to watch perform as well. You will not be disappointed listening to his music.

B009EELBIS|5.0|The Sound of Music is a timeless classic that everyone should see at least once in their life. One of my favorites.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|A true eye opener that makes us look at success differently. It makes us challenge success stories we hear and to dig deeper for the real cause of the success. Malcolm argues that it many times are a series of lucky events or opportunities rather than high Iq and intelligence that lies behind someone's success or superiority.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It's a good movie, but I think the ending could have been much better. I think they drop the ball on the ending of the movie.
B00EMJBVAI|5.0|Great movie. Didn't follow the book very closely, but great story regardless. 5 stars is my review. Definite must see for zombie lovers.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is a cool app I like it cool game. It was easy to understand. My son can please with ease as well.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have to say that I was not excited about this book, suspecting that a sequel to something as old as The Shining was probably just a way to get something on the shelves. I read this book in 5 days though; the combination of new characters and old giving it a depth and texture that even Stephen King only gets every once in a while. I loved Abra and grown-up Dan and loved hating Rose the Hat. For me, this book is the Shining, the Dark Tower series, Duma Key and Rose Madder all rolled into one and made new again. Loved it!
B00EDLP6O2|3.0|Yes, this is a good game indeed, but don't let the video trick you, the game  on a Kindle Fire HD  or a Kindle Fire in general (Excluding the newest one, the Kindle Fire Gx? Or something like that) sucks. The compare the graphics AND gamplay to with a REAL Android Device supporting google Play with  a Kindle Fire, trust me, you all will be better off getting this on a Nexus or something
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I bought this for my mom as she enjoys this musician.  David Foster is involved in the production of this and he is a talented musician.  If you are wondering if you would like the music, you can listen to samples of each song on this page towards the top.  My mom appreciated this gift.  I like to give music as it's a gift they can enjoy over the years on an ongoing basis, and they will think of you.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|I remember reading this book when I was in elementary school.  It was the first book I ever read that wasn't happy all the way through.  I like Sara's belief in her own worth, even when her circumstances changed for the worst.  She still believes she is a princess.  This is a very important message for girls to learn.  Each one is a princess with potential.  Be sure your daughters and granddaughters see this movie.

B00F35BV64|3.0|The characters and actors are excellent for this new series. The first movie was great with a good plot. But let's try to get some better writers to make sense of a hard to understand plot. It is so choppy and doesn't blend between chapters.<br /><br />This movie has a few frantic parts to it that have a difficult time coming together. It is hard to really tell if this movie is trying to retell the original &#34;Kahn&#34; episode or make it a new experience. Definitely an injustice to the Star Trek series.<br /><br />The crew, the characters, the awesome background and fans of the Star Trek stories, please try it again and make a better understandable plot with no retried verbiage. You have so much going for it, why not use it, take us away with a wild and fun storyline &#34;where no man has gone before&#34;.
B001FAFO3W|5.0|This Right here is a movie memory of my childhood. We used to own it on vhs but that was quickly played to death. When  i got older i was told i could find it on netflix, but it wasnt there, So my only choice was to buy it. And buy it i did. i don't regret buying it at all. Now if i ever have children, they hopefully can enjoy it, if i have a dvd player and a tv that will connect with it.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|The girls will be happy because McConaughey takes of his shirt and parades around with determination.<br />The kids really bring the whole thing together, the adults seem a little fuzzy, the plot is slow to develop but the last third of the movie is really great!<br /><br />My wife and I watched it together. She followed it much better than I. And, she said she liked it a lot after the first half was over. She perked up a lot with what happened in the story during the second half of the movie.<br /><br />Muddy water turns into clear storyline and good acting.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Excellent game for the whole family. Easy to learn for the young ones and interesting enough for the older kids. Progress is quick and you don't have to spend money to get somewhere in the game.
B000NMW6M0|5.0|The main actor in the movie is a high powered rifle. Very educating how this gun influences and changes all these people's lives, their families, their employers, and their marriages. A very simple thing, a grateful client thanks his guide by giving him a rifle he admired. And it begins, the killing, daughter watches as mother commits suicide, never recovers, brothers challenge each other and shoot a woman sitting on a bus, man must make a decisions that will change their lives, husbands lose control of being able to help their wives, who, in turn, lose their children who almost die in the desert, who then lose their Nana, who gets sent back across the border, who loses her life in America, and never sees them again.  Best Brad Pitt movie, fantastic tear jerking plot. people don't kill people, GUNS kill people.
B00846REIS|4.0|great story and amazing sex scene but the climax of this book is not good as it should be. 3.5 is fair enough.
B00EB6F1TY|2.0|I am not going to purchase the DVD or rent the movie.  We saw this in the theatres, and as we walked out, my wife and I both gave a \\"thumbs down\\".<br />Taking a good set of characters and making them unwatchable - the producer/directors really messed up.  I hope it isn't, but it is very likely a portent of things to come.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it for folks who haven't watched it.  Let me just summarize:<br /><br />Iron-man One - Tony Stark is introduced, and overcomes being jailed in a cave in Pakistan, ending with a great rendition of a Stan Lee superhero<br />Iron-man two - Tony gets to the root of his father issues, and we see what Hammer industries gets when they team up with a super-villain.<br />Iron-man three - Pepper Potts becomes a new super-hero by falling unprotected into lava.  Tony doesn't need to get off the couch - his remote control lets him handle 100 iron-man drones at a time while he sips margaritas.<br /><br />Sometimes CGI can ruin a movie.  We liked the characters in the series - but they didn't deliver this time.  Just seeing 100 copies of the same suit-drone flying around shooting stuff isn't fun to watch.

B006ATJXQW|4.0|I really enjoyed this prequel to Maze Runner. An enjoyable read, and interesting characters. I found it to be better than the final maze Runner book. My only complaint was the ending. It felt rushed, and left me with questions.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|My favourite of all!!! Lots of tears!!!! You HAVE to read this, so much happening you won't want to put it down
B00BIPCY14|5.0|I'm hooked now.  Once you are into the characters it is adictive to watch the next episode.  Good acting and good writting.  The cases they try are interesting enough to keep me involved.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Twists and turns as usual. Also great surprises around each corner. Whoever heard of such a large loggerhead turtle? It's so nice to be in Benton and Kay's home again with Lucy and Marino.
B00BT70J6S|5.0|This 41 CD/1 DVD set presents a generous selection of Vladimir Horowitz's appearances at Carnegie Hall from 1943-1978.  It includes all Carnegie concerts RCA and Columbia (both now owned by Sony) recorded from 1951-1978.  It also contains three complete recitals that were recorded by the Carnegie Hall Recording Company at Horowitz's expense.  The pianist donated about 13 of these recitals along with other material to Yale University and they are sometimes referred to as the \\"Yale concerts.\\"  Parts of these concerts have been issued piecemeal since the 1990s and are also compiled here.  The 1953 and 1966-1968 recitals are presented unedited for the first time - indeed, everything except the 1976 and 1978 concerts are presented \\"as-is\\".  In a few cases, the set contains back-to-back performances of Horowitz playing the same program.  Of course, Horowitz never played works twice in the same way, so the duplication of repertoire will not faze aficionados.<br /><br />Horowitz's recording career can be divided into five distinct phases; this set covers phases 2-4.  Space does not permit a detailed analysis of each performance, so I will give my impressions of each phase:<br /><br />1943-1953:  In this era, technical limitations simply did not exist.  But, relaxation is a challenge:  the Mozart K. 333 Sonata from 1951 is wound very tightly; there are places where some of the playing is positively brutal - which suits certain pieces such as the Prokofiev Seventh, Kabalevsky Second, and Barber Sonatas (all composers that he dropped after 1953).  There are moments of charm, such as Haydn's E-flat sonata (presented twice), but they are relatively rare.  The two recordings of Tchaikovsky's First Piano concerto make for fascinating comparison: the 1943 War Bonds performance with Toscanini is very straight; the 1953 performance with Szell is phrased more rhapsodically in the opening movement, while the pianist sounds as if he's been shot from a cannon for the finale's octave torrent.  There are only two compositions entirely new to the Horowitz discography: Brahms Rhapsody in E-flat, Op. 119, No. 4, and Debussy's The Little Shepherd from the Children's Corner Suite, both from the 1953 25th Anniversary recital.  A sense of unease pervades the opening measures of the Brahms, with several wrong notes - I can see why Horowitz declined to release it.  As for the rest of the recital, it's more balanced than I remember.  Perhaps it's because the concert is now presented unedited, but there's a greater sense of ebb and flow to the Schubert D. 960 Sonata, while Scriabin Ninth Sonata is satanic, and the Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 is as thrilling as ever.<br /><br />1965-1968:  This, for me, is Horowitz's true peak.  The technique is largely intact, but the interpretations have a new sense of depth and repose, and there is a wider tonal palette - although that may be the result of superior recording technology.  Further, the pianist has lost nothing in the way of charisma: it's clear he has the audience in the palms of his hands throughout each recital, even when a string snaps on his piano as happened at the November 24, 1968 recital.  Due to the overwhelming demand for tickets, Horowitz repeated the same program several times from the 1960s onward.  It's illustrative of Horowitz's spontaneity to compare the pianist's performances of identical works from different concerts.  An extreme example is Chopin's Second Sonata:  The November 1966 performance is taut and lean in the opening movements, with a haunting funeral march; while the December performance is stately and measured - more restrained (both wisely eschew the first movement repeat that's heard in the 1949 recital).  There are several works which are new to Horowitz's stereo discography: Beethoven's Variations in C minor, Mendelsohn's Song without Words, Op. 67, No. 5, and Poulenc's Toccata - all in fine performances that should have been released decades ago.<br /><br />1975-1978:  Here a decline in Horowitz's playing is evident from the get-go.  It's clear from the 1975 recitals that the pianist is trying to prove he can still pull off the technical stunts of his youth (and even middle age), which often he can no longer do.  While his technique is secure in most of the standard repertoire, from Liszt's By the Source to Chopin's Scherzo in B minor, in certain works - such as Rachmaninoff's Etude Tableau in D and the finale from the Second Sonata - the pianist tries to cover up technical lapses with an overblown, bombastic style.  In Schumann's Sonata in F minor (presented twice), Horowitz does not seem to have fully assimilated and internalized the work, and seems to be fighting it rather than playing it - fortunately RCA recorded it again in California several months later as the version issued on LP in 1976 is superb in every respect.  That same year, Horowitz made a rare appearance as a chamber performer at the celebration of Carnegie Hall's 85th anniversary.  The rendition of the slow movement of Rachmaninoff's Cello Sonata with Rostropovich is about the most beautiful, loving thing you'll ever hear.  What a pity they were never persuaded to record the whole piece.  The opening movement of the Tchaikovsky trio has moments of greatness as well as lapses of ensemble - along with some unsteady intonation from Isaac Stern.  Horowitz brings far more imagination to the piano part of Schumann's Dichterliebe than one normally hears, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau was reportedly displeased with the results.  While the recitals are presented unedited, the edit the baritone requested in Ich grolle nicht has been retained.  Even more substantially edited is the Golden Jubilee performance of Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto from 1978.  This was Horowitz's first time playing with an orchestra since 1953, and while there are many beautiful and heartfelt moments, the performance has some rough spots.  There are more technical lapses here - even with editing - than later performances with Zubin Mehta (which was televised on NBC) and in Ann Arbor with Ormandy - a stunning performance where Horowitz nearly equals his younger self.<br /><br />For many, the real prize here will be the 1968 mini-recital which was televised by CBS.  (Can anyone imagine a major network broadcasting a classical piano recital today?  It was a demonstration not only of Horowitz's celebrity, but the larger role Classical music played in America's cultural life at the time).  Copies of this recital of variable quality have been circulating privately and on the Internet for decades, and small portions have been shown on various documentaries.  This is the first time the entire recital has been remastered from something close to the original videotape.  I believe the producers have done all they can with the 45 year old standard definition video tape.  The image quality is a bit blurred, and there are occasional signs of wear, but overall it's very watchable.  The stereo sound, which has been newly synced from Columbia's master tapes, is superb - a vast improvement over what TV audiences would have heard in 1968 (the original mono soundtrack is included as well).  For those only familiar with Lang Lang and a host of other performers who agonize throughout their performances, Horowitz's concentration, economy of motion, and straightforward platform manner will come as a shock.  This most aurally flamboyant of performers was a portrait of rectitude visually.  Astute listeners will notice several minor differences in Horowitz's performance from the companion LP, Horowitz on Television.  The pianist played through his entire recital program twice, along with a few selected retakes after the second concert.  The network chose which takes to use primarily on the basis of visual quality, while the takes for the album were chosen for musical reasons.  Whatever the differences in detail, the performance is consistently some of the tightest, most disciplined playing I've ever heard from Horowitz - how fortunate a visual document of the recital is now available.<br /><br />Most of the recordings here have been newly remastered.  The sound restoration in the 1960s recitals is especially impressive; the listener gets a real sense of hall ambience (along with the occasional subway running underneath the hall).  The mono items sound mostly good, although there is one issue with about 30 seconds of heavy surface noise during Liszt's R&aacute;k&oacute;czy March which stems from the original 78rpm disc.  The book includes complete recording information, an essay by producer Jon Samuels about the work that went into remastering the set (reading about the way RCA and Columbia handled Horowitz's recorded legacy will curl your hair), an appreciation by Jed Distler, and a history of Carnegie Hall by Richard Evidon.  This last was not particularly interesting to me, as it's obvious Horowitz played so often at Carnegie mostly because it was convenient for him - and judging by the many pirate recordings available, Horowitz tended to be at his best in small college towns like New Haven and Ann Arbor.<br /><br />I hope Sony will issue the remaining Yale recitals before the source material deteriorates further.  A release of selected unissued studio material, which has been circulating privately, would also be in order.performances with Zubin Mehta (which was televised on NBC) and in Ann Arbor with Ormandy - a stunning performance where Horowitz nearly equals his younger self.<br /><br />For many, the real prize here will be the 1968 mini-recital which was televised by CBS.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|Ok movie, not great.  Ending poor.  Could have been so much more........relied to heavily on special effects and not a good story line.
B000I9UA30|5.0|Really fun flick.  Will Smith plays his usual regular guy charm to make this quite entertaining. Also, like always the Americans are smarter than everybody else, so they come back and save the world.  It is great Hollywood.
B003U6BE8I|2.0|Juvenile.  My mistake for watching.  It is geared for young teens, not very bright young teens.  Formula writing at its best/worst.
B00991TCOG|5.0|The musical talent that this young lady possesses is top notch.  This was an excellent blend of classical and breakbeat.  Well worth every penny.  I am excited for the next CD!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good for the genre'.  The comic book direction of the movies in recent years is getting a bit over done exactly like what happened to the actual comics.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|As a single woman without children, I found a lot of the chapters didn't apply to me.  I did find some of the first chapters helpful since they explain some of the hang-ups women have in the office environment.  Overall, I'd say I wasn't exactly the target audience for this book.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Use this every day and it has become handy and well keep using it on all my units. For as long<br />As I drive
B0089LOG02|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this well-written story.  I couldn't put it down once I started reading.  It left me wanting to know more about this era in American history.  Although I knew that immigrant families had a very difficult transition during this time, I had never heard of the Orphan Trains and the impact they had on all involved.  Although I wanted to continue to follow the stories of these characters, it also made me wonder about the Children's Aid Society workers who transplanted these children to other parts of the country.  This tale will stay with me for a long time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It only gets better and better.<br />I never thought I would enjoy a British show, but we have fallen madly in love with this series.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|game is cool.if you like animals this is the game.I'm with the another guy a wonder aquarium. would be cool too.

B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love these types of movies. Their is singing involved, most of the singing is conversation their having with one another. This is about a man who has been abandoned, unloved and abused. In the process he became bitter and angry. This changed who he was and turned him to a beast (Not because of his looks). The so call love he had for her was more like bondage than real love. The light shined on this when she finally saw what real love was. It's light not darkness, freedom and not oppression.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|Awesome!!! Another great addition to the rest of my Cold Steel San Mai collection!!! I just about have them all now!!! : )
B007BVOEPI|5.0|One of the best books ever, now its a great tv show too. I waited until recently to watch it, now I am excited for next season.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Game provides a great opportunity to flex your brain cells. Each level provides you with a unique challenge that will keep you focused. The only draw back there are only 10 levels.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|After being nothing less than truly captivated by this book I feel that I should/will highly recommend it to anyone I meet. I am not known for being an avid reader, but after watching John Green's YouTube videos for sometime I saved and bought one of his books. I now feel as if I have a greater understanding and appreciation for him (as the author) than I did prior to this novel.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|I'm of the opinion, that CGI is having a devastating effect on Sci-fi. The essential ingredient for a brilliant Science Fiction Film, is the script and it's underlying philosophy, a script void of thought provoking elements, is just another action film.<br />Moon is in a category of it's own; I found the script so compelling, I literally watched this film 3 times in a row. The themes were relevant to present time, but beyond that, there was great depth in the subject matter.<br />One of the main themes of the film, \\"cooperate abuse/power,\\" is presented effectively in the opening scene and summarized powerfully (In it's subtlety), in the final scene. Duncan demonstrates how an ignorant public feeds the cooperate machine and how easily fooled we all are.......\\"Next caller\\"....and with these words, the truth is erased and the public returns to indifference.<br />Sam Rockwell, blew me away, with his performance/s.........a true artist. This is never an easy role for an actor (Or actress), as his performance alone, must carry the film and he does this to great effect. His performance draws you in and we see his character/s evolve and the emotion is intensely genuine. BEAUTIFUL!!!<br />The score is exceptional as well and rather than detract from the film, it only enhances it greatly. We feel with greater effect, the emotions of the protagonist, due in part to the score. \\"Haunting\\" is the word someone else used; aptly put.<br />If you LOVE deep Sci-Fi, don't miss this film.
B001XUIBNO|4.0|Have always known of movie but wasn't drawn to watching it until I heard an interesting reference to it. Watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Worth watching!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I thought it was very well written but did not expect the tragic conclusion.  Also felt that we needed to know more about the mother's condition at the end-
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I'm not sure why British television seems more thoughtful than programs here in the States.  This series is well worth your time.  The acting is first rate, and the plot will keep you guessing.
B000001FTD|4.0|I had this years ago and used to listen to it to workout, I bought it for the same reason this time, it's a fast paced album and great for walking or biking, etc.
B005LAII44|5.0|My daughter has no cable, so movies are great for her. She watches it a lot. Really great movie. Thanks.

B000LTAY1U|4.0|This watch keeps excellent time, but needs constant attention to keep it wound.  Most folks don't wear the same watch every day, and if you do not wear this on any given day, it will need reset when you go to put it on.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|My son loved his surprise gift and we got it off Amazon for less than the store was charging.  Best decision we made for Christmas last year.  The console is perfect for him to take to a friends house, and he uses it when his friends come over.

B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I loved his previous two books and this one is also a good read. Hosseini tells a series of stories that interconnect in this book. The impact of wars across the generations is described in subtle detail and the influences of the traits of the characters are explored in this really well told narrative.
B000HRMCUC|5.0|My daughter has no cable, so movies are great for her. She watches it a lot. Really great movie. Thanks.

B0060CX8F6|5.0|How can I describe the experience this movie gives... I know.  The best break a parent could want so we can get dinner made. The bright colors and quick movements are a tribute to the Disney talent of hypnotism on young children. Thanks Disney.
B0052Z0MJW|2.0|Fairly average offering from Dan Brown. It's a readable pot boiler. Not a very challenging plot.  Not a patch on Inferno.
1449410243|5.0|This was a very well put together book and extremely funny.  Or so I was told by the person it was purchased for!  ;)
0802473156|5.0|OK, just started reading this and am TOTALLY stoked. REALLY helped my partner and I understand each other and helped us focus our efforts on showing love in the way that will be understood. Everyone, of course, needs all 5 languages in their lives, but it's SO NICE to understand why some things resonate more than others.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this game. Can't put it down. The have only played the 5 x 5 grid so far but looking forward to attempting the larger puzzles.
0143124544|3.0|I don't really know what to say about this book. the author I believe is known more for light romances, this really isn't that type of book.<br />it is at times light, but deals with the subject of right to death. ok read
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was a captivating novel. It discussed a little known event in our history in which thousands of orphaned children from big cities, were transported to small towns in the Midwest and \\"distributed\\" to whomever chose them. As one can imagine, this had various outcomes, depending on the household in which the child was placed. Babies had the best chance of being placed in loving homes, while older children were typically chosen for nefarious reasons such as forced labor. These unfortunate children were given little in the way of affection or comfort from their chosen \\"families\\". Even worse, there was little follow up by the organizations who were behind this effort. Indeed it was unclear as to how these organizations profited from the endeavor.<br /><br />The story focuses on two main characters: one of whom was an orphan on one of those trains during the Great Depression, and the other, a modern young girl with problems of her own. The story transitions between these two characters, and the relationship they develop. The ending will surprise and delight! A great read.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I don't know how I managed to miss this for so long. I'm so glad I watched, but sad there are no more seasons. Sets, stories, worlds are all very well done but it's the characters that make this a winner. Each one is unique, complex, real and interesting. You want to know these people and you care what happens to them.
B00E9P959E|5.0|received this the day it came out and happy to say it is everything I wanted it to be !!!!! highly suggest everyone revive your turntables and start or restart listening to records they sound soooooo much better and dont get damaged like cds do so glad Rush decided to release this album in lp format evreything about it screams quality !!!!!!!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Trying out games for my android phone looking for something to keep mind occupied I stumbled across Star Traders RPG. Me being a softy when it comes to space and anything with RPG in the title I give it a try and was not disappointed. Finding myself playing this over other games I owned for consoles I had to support the developers and bought it and never regretted it. I have even got another copy for another divide I have.
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|I only got it for my grandson and he loved it! I read my book while it was playing and even he had to look away some!

B0070NSPCU|1.0|Writing ok but content lacks... nothing new or done better than a LOT of other authors have done.skip unless really notes
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It's fun and easy to play! If you ever want to kill some time, or need something to do this game is fun.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Finally something minecraft and lego fans can agree on! We have the other two and needs to complete our collection. Ty for making that happen.
1250030951|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />AT A GLANCE REVIEW:<br /><br />Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell was absolutely wonderful. It's honestly hard to pin point what I loved about it but it was just THAT FEELING you get when you read something and can't pull yourself out of it. That CONNECTION to the story and all the FEELS. What I do know is that Fangirl was delightfully funny and a great story that I fell in love with. I'm glad I didn't get hung up on the fact that Cath's story was so heavily rooted in fanfiction/fandom because it was about SO MUCH MORE. Reading the premise could have turned me off had I not known Rainbow Rowell's books are MUST READS for me no matter what.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW:<br /><br />If I hadn't already fallen head over heels with Eleanor & Park by Rainbow Rowell I'm not sure I would have picked this up just because I've never been part of any sort of fandom or have even read one lick of fanfiction and so the premise didn't really speak to me. I mean, you guys know I JUST started the Harry Potter series this week so I haven't even been super involved growing up with any sort of series. I was SO scared I wasn't going to connect to this one because of this but Rainbow Rowell certainly proved me wrong and wrote a story that I related to in so many ways that it honestly surprised me and I found myself devouring it.<br /><br />Rowell weaves the fanfiction that Cath writes along with the story. It honestly took me a little bit to get used to but Rowell wrote it in a way that I realized I could skip it or skim it if I wanted. I opted for skimming so I'd get the sense of what she was writing about but didn't take my time reading it like I did with the rest of the story. So don't be afraid of this aspect if you aren't into the fanfiction aspect! While I didn't connect with the fandom/fanfiction life of it I totally connected with this passion that Cath had and related it to our little book blogging community in ways. Cath is so wrapped up in her fanfiction world and at times I see myself so immersed in our community.<br /><br />Sure, a lot of this story has to do with Cath and her fanfiction writing and how she and her sister have bonded through this but it's about way more than that -- feeling your way through that weird transition between kidhood and adulthood, seeing people for who they are and not who you WANT them to be, first loves, sisterhood, independence and so much more.<br /><br />Fangirl was just one of those books that was a delight to read and so, so funny. I loved Cath's story and her journey -- even though she was a tough one for me to warm up to at first. My first I LOVE YOU CATH moment was a certain Emergency Kanye Dance Party part. She's flawed, kind of judgmental, not exactly comfortable in her own skin, holds people to wicked high standards, doesn't like change, etc. Even though I don't think I immediately would say Cath and I were super alike, I could feel in my core some of these same things manifested in my own self. I related so well concerning her struggles with her sister because I definitely had tension with my sister as we both changed and stopped being best friends because of these differences. I wanted to HATE Wren but I recognized that we are ONLY see Wren through Cath's POV so it's not the whole picture and I KNOW when I was having issues with my sister I definitely only painted a bad one. I also learned that I couldn't expect my sister to uphold the same things I did -- so I really UNDERSTOOD Cath but also saw the error of her ways. Her flaws and her journey to grapple with some of these things made me love her. Also I can't say enough about some of the other characters. Reagan & Levi &lt;33<br /><br />I will say that I saw a Twitter exchange ( I can't remember who) mention that they were turned off because of how little we saw of the fandom and the WHYS of it being so important to her and I didn't think of it while I was reading but I actually really agree as much as I loved this book. I initially felt my disconnect with the whole fandom thing as why I didn't SEE how it was so important in her life but really I do think, looking back, it wasn't really explored as much. We just KNEW it was important but didn't really at all feel whymy disconnect with the whole fandom thing as why I didn't SEE how it was so important in her life but really I do think, looking back, it wasn't really explored as much.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|In an age were everything gets streched out it is refreshing to see what Neil Gaiman can do with an economy of words an phrasese. Special that to &#34;The incomporable&#34; podcast that recomended this book what a great gift.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|The MGS Legacy Collection contains a code voucher for Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid VR Missions to be redeemed in the PSN store. The two disc set contains MGS 2, 3, 4, Peace Walker and the motion comics as well as the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake. If you haven't gotten the HD Collection, the Legacy Collection is the way to go for the full MGS experience. It should be noted that the Legacy Collection uses the HD Collection discs, but relabels them.<br /><br />The edition from Amazon's preorder contained an artbook that collected various promotional images and posters of the games throughout the years. There is also a two page promo for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid game &#34;Ground Zeroes&#34;<br /><br />The gameplay is as sharp was it was when it was first released and if you've played them all before, you're likely to get a bit nostalgic. That being said, the controls for the earlier games are not as tight as the more recent titles, but it doesn't take long to adjust to that.<br /><br />If you have not played Metal Gear Solid Series I recommend it to any gamer out there. It has an epic storyline. =)
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Slow at times.  Still want more info on Gideon.  Looking forward to next book.<br /><br />I thought this was a trilogy?

1451695195|1.0|The title of the book is deceiving. It does not give \\"proof\\" of heaven, it only gives proof that this Dr thinks he is superior because he went to a much higher realm because he was so intelligent. He did not use God's name or call heaven heaven.  This book was about his adoptive life, his superior Dr father, his Dr friends. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this book at all.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Well written, witty and exciting. Working as a waitress I can relate and get an inside look into the kitchen.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|The team has characters that show strong values while having very different personalities.  Tony is the guy we love to hate.  Zeva is the woman I would love to be.  Abby is everybody's kid sister, a pain in the neck at times.  Ducky is my favorite uncle.  McGee is my favorite - smart, kind, sweet, and always there for others.  I miss the McGee that gets embarrassed easily.  All in all, it is never disappointing.
B007SGM084|5.0|great plot. believable characters. this girl seriously could have been one of my friends. loved it. definitely would read this again.
B002WBTRBI|5.0|Language can be a bit vulgar, but it fits the characters. John travolta does a good job and comes off as a loan shark collector. Each of the major characters is a bit overplayed at times but it all works. Even the apparant breaks in continuity work as comic relief

Such an annoying read to be honest. Also the correspondence between Mark & Juliet was just retarded! How could they send four to five letters in the same day!!!!! They weren't texting, they were writing letters! DUMB.<br /><br />And really, can somebody write letters everyday??? That tells me that Juliet didn't have a life. WEIRD

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So nice to sit and watch something that doesn't unexpectedly throw out the &#34;F&#34; bomb. The plot turn at the end of season 3 is annoying, but I will still be anxious for season 4.
B003L20IHE|5.0|It's  amazing its sad and it's the best movie I have ever seen anybody who watches this and doesn't cry is superhuman!
B0094M2GXE|1.0|A great cast, but just sleazy. Not what I expected at all, disappointing and I would not recommend to any one.
B0088W6LGY|5.0|I absoultely love this series. Season one is probably the &#34;slowest&#34; of all seasons, but still a great season. Time for the next season.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter got me onto this game and I have spent a lot of time playing it and enjoying it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|A totally well thought out read, that had me baffled most of the time, a fantastic chain of events leading to well, you have to experience those on your own, I am not going to spoil Blake Crouch' s thunderous creation. This my friends is a must read, the end absolutely blew my mind with the blending of creativity a big WOW all the way.<br />Book two is my next read..
B007EC27QM|4.0|Works just like a regular calculator and is nice and big on my kindle.If you need a calculator this works great.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I am soo glad it is on the kindle now because my cousin had and i loved the game sooo yeah
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really fun game to play. Totally addicting. It almost made me late taking my kid to school lol. Ive tried other puzzle games like this but never really got into them but this ones different. The 5x5s are easy enough to learn,  without getting frustrated but not boring either.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Well written and well acted. I especially liked the development of the two main characters as individuals and as partners.
B00DYOOGYK|2.0|I think that this game would be great if it would go past the download screen. I got it and it won't go past it. I freezes and returns home. I got rio which was great but this is glitching. Any help?
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I did not find this scary at all. It felt to me and me alone, like he was trying to hard. It felt rushed and fake? I made myself finish it and I am sad to say that his books since Cell have been basically, awful. I was a huge fan but no longer. I do like his son Joe hill's writing and he is a great author. If you want to read a book that is like older SK on Red Bull, pick up Joe Hill's books. I may skip anything else by SK. To me, a waste of time and more importantly,money.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I can not wait to go to more challenging puzzles I am really enjoying it  I can't put it down
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun fun.i like this game bunch. Is a little challenging, but with a little deductive reasoning will get you there. I recommend this game
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is fun . Full of action  . From a slaying monsters to gathering treasure . BUT  be careful it is really easy to keep buying crystals to improve your items . And the check in with face book note keeps popping up . And when your in a fight it is really annoying .
B00CE004XM|5.0|This bluesy pop CD is very entertaining.  It has the rough soaring voice of Beth Hart and the superb blues guitar of Joe Bonamassa combined again on another great collection of songs.  Or nearly great collection.  I don't like &#34;Strange Fruit&#34;.  Never have and never will.  Nothing wrong with the vocals or instrumentals, it is just a bad song.
