B001AQO3QA|1.0|Ordered this during the black friday sale. Received it today but the first three movies have bad scratches on them. The third looks like someone scraped over concrete with the disc! Cardboard sleeve packaging = damaged discs. I am returning for a refund and buying the single discs which are still on sale. Check your discs after purchasing if you get this set.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book helps you if you need to find the definition of any word. This is the best dictionary I have ever read.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book is the best I've ever read.so ready for the rest of the story l loved it so much:)
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Loving the quests & puzzles!!<br />Very mysterious & intriguing!<br />Keeps us waiting for more energy always :)<br /><br />Block game confused us at first
B00CE03UOC|3.0|I am by no means a smart man but this was not at all challenging.  It started out fun but then by the end of only the first pack I was done.  And there are like five packs.  So I skipped ahead.  Yeah still the same. I will pay some more but I expect more of the same.  This style of &quot;connect the dots&quot; game has no real playability.  Looks great and sons great but after about 71 levels without being even slightly stumped.  Well....
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Great group and a great CD. I hope they add to it more in the  future because it would be great to hear. Its a nice switch-up from the run of the mill Xmas music you always hear.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|All the game needs is to hAve more animals and let us control the horse completely<br /><br />Love one of your biggest players<br />Autumn
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a great way to spend time on something if your board but I would only give it three star's
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is fantastic. Absolutely  a creative cure for insomniacs worldwide. We have found it to be unanimous, this app is fabulously necessary to download at once. It is not without issue's, however the challenge is partially rewarding.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun! Seriously addictive! It's a lot like Temple Run, but with the added bonus of minions. I would definitely recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|completely addicted to this game. the goals and tasks are challenging but achievable. all aspects are great especially the graphics and the cute minions.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|I love Adille Laudin's Women of Courage.  I am never disappointed and each book makes me want more.  I love reading books that leave me wanting more.
B008X9I6X8|3.0|Historically accurate, who knows, but if you want a way to trick your \\"i don't want to watch a porno\\" spouse into watching one, get the unedited cut. The actors are well known, but the story is not all that coherent. The sex and violence is about the best part, if one can even say that, but a poor misuse of some great actors time.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|While beautifully written, Americanah is extremely accessible and compelling. This is what highlighters were made for. Gems of phrases and retorts that you want to recall and conjure at the perfect moment, in the perfect group. Adichie's honest looks at the intersecting, interculturalities of both love and race in Nigeria and the US through fiction, seems somehow to create a more truthful lense on the topics than any social study could. I was sad when it ended but ecstatic that it was written. I recommend it to everyone I meet. I think I'm going to list it in my top 5 favorites of all time. Thank you for writing this, Chimamanda!
B00380URIO|5.0|I hadn't seen any previews or descriptions of the movie so I went in blind with no expectations. I don't want to give too much away (It's no Keyser S&ouml;ze or Shyamalan twist) but the focus of the film evolves from the simple narrative you expect from the beginning sequences. Then it deals with the expanded plot in depth and with ramifications beyond what you expect.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Amazingly in-depth and well researched. I'll never look at a piece of bread the same again! Just eat real food.
1936891026|2.0|A big theme of this book was the concept of resistance and becoming a pro, the first two \\"books\\" in it.  Resistance being all those distractions and excuses we use to prevent us from doing what we should be doing and what we dream of doing. Being a pro is having the discipline and gumption to just do it. Some good things for sure, but after reading the first two chapters, resistance and pro, it got a little....wordy....repetitive....too esoteric...whatelse, hmmm. Of all the types of resistance the author lists ( ex. resistance from fear, resistance from procrastination, from allies (other time wasters), from self medication, etc.), he fails to realize that there are indeed valid forms of resistance that actually benefit us. Like resistance from experience (been there, done that), resistance from not wanting to waste time, and resistance from being sold a line of trash, and, in this books case, resistance from over-doing it. I'd read the first two books, guess i'd recommend them, but I met with the \\"resistance of completely losing interest\\" at the beginning of the third book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very fun game. Nice graphics very smooth a bit tricky to play on a tablet but it makes it all the more fun and challenging.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|There's nothing not to like about this book.  Two quirky kids fall in love. &#34;Just three words long.&#34;  Read it!
B00A757EFW|3.0|Didnt like the fact that the joystick button is in middle of game board. other than that great applike.original game
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Very well acted and directed.  Denzel portrays a broken man who has skill enough to navigate a dangerous flying situation but no skills to navigate the relationships in his life until he becomes accountable.  Great hero's journey story.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Heard a lot about True Blood and do not have HBO so I order all 5 seasons on dvds and just finish the the first season. Got a shock when there was all the nudity but I still enjoy the show. Just started the second season and loveing it. This is so different from the Vampire Diaries. Will post again when I finish the second season.
B000JLTR8G|2.0|Mostly shot on location.  A time capsule of what Tokyo looked like some 40 years ago.  Japanese actors look fabulous; not so much for the American actors.  Minimalistic scrip; what there is of it is pretty silly.  Direction is languid and seems to have been lost in translation (an interview with the Director indicates that the language barrier was a major problem with the film).  Gorgeous print with lots of easily read (uncluttered and leisurely presented/photographed) Hiragana and Katakana  symbols to practice your reading skills.  Just turn off the sound (unless you are monitoring the accuracy of the subtitles) and enjoy the views!  WILLIAM FLANIGAN
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Death, incest, wife being, loss, Catholic guilt how could you ask for a better book. Oh don't forget the psychotic knife welding 6 year old.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Thought provoking, tender, full of love and answers. Breaks down the truth-your own personal truth. Think this has something for everyone. Beautifully written and inspiring. amazing author!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Just started playing but so far not to bad of a game not as good as sim city and I don't like the loss of energy
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I'm very glad I purchased this device.  It works flawlessly with my iPad to play YouTube videos on the TV.  I deducted one star since it is not yet compatible with many other applications.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Very engaging thriller. Lots of action and mind twisters. There were at least 3 subplots but they were easy to follow and it was a surprise how they all were tied together in the end. I will definitely look for more Pendergast mysteries.
B004FQX5D4|5.0|You can't go wrong with this classic vampire movie.  Highly recommend if looking for a classic movie and addition to your library.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|evil? No.<br /><br />Scary? Not really.<br /><br />Boring? Well,it took me more than three sittings to get through this movie.<br /><br />Didn't sam raimi play a part in the spartacus series?<br /><br />I expected so much more from this film and was left with nothing but an empty bored feeling.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 7 and 5 yr old daughters like this game. My oldest plays it most. My 5 yr old loves it but doesn't understand it as much. She just likes to pet the horse. Lol
B0063IH60K|5.0|How can you go wrong with solitaire. I got this for my Kindle but unfortunately have had little time to play the game. That is actually a good thing because it is hard to put down once you start.
B0014BY72Q|1.0|I  am a sci-fi fan and thought I would like this boy was I wrong. It is depressing, Michael York does a good job acting but  the story is just so bad.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Very nice, and works well.  No surprises with this item.  Nice packaging.  No complaints.  Fairly short cable, box has rubber feet so it pretty much stays put.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Best book I have  read in a long time. This book made me very happy an  I could not put it down I finished the whole thing in  two days and was wanting more after! The characters really grew on me to! I thought that the book was so adorable and definitely made me a believer in silver linings  I highly suggest that you read this amazing book
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is one of the few games I added to my Kindle. It took me a while to figure it out, then I couldn't put it down.  I am still learning about tricks of the game from fellow bird followers.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|All you haters, get a sense of humor! These movies are &#34;feel goods&#34; , not to be taken seriously. The quality is first class and the actors are having fun for a change. Hope there are many more to come!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a very fun game.  Really enjoyed playing it. I would recommend it to all my friends and family.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|Well done.  A good movie, but the sad reality of too many institutions.  Too many boys have suffered such a fate.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great app 4 brain stretching but enjoyable as any solitaire card game without being at the mercy of pure chance
B00004X10B|5.0|I really like this product. It is very well built and has plenty of room for two camera bodies, several lenses and all my photo accessories. I highly recommend it.
0062107313|5.0|This book isn't getting enough credit here on these reviews— it's a hell of a fun read. Exceptionally entertaining. I have found all of Amy Tan's works to be different from one another, and this one reminded me a little of Lisa See's Shanghai Girls in its hugeness. Like See's work, it's large and sweeping, covering vast amounts of time over mere paragraphs. Some people can find that a little overwhelming (sometimes details can be nice— &#34;Five years later...&#34; what?) but I found it effective. It covers a whole lot of time and a whole lot of events, all of which kept me interested. I really, really love it.
B00FMRWA22|5.0|This is basically the Biograph CD. This was suppose to contain all his movie songs All of them not there. Girl of north country? a couple others. Im glad i did not buy the complete set for this, I would have been p*ssed.. I still love you bob. 5 Stars only because the Biograph CD is a real gem!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!  It is soooo addictive!  I play it on every device that I own...over and over and over!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Saw this years ago and didn't remember it as being this good. A bit raw, and certainly not for family viewing, but a well developed, told and acted story. Morgan Freeman is in top form.
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|Personal Breakthrough: The Ultimate Guide to Mastering Your Life by Jonathan Bello  is a great guide.<br /><br />I personally love how the writer describes everything in a very easy to read way to understand.<br /><br />I think for anyone who wants to take their life to a whole other level will definitely enjoy this book. It doesn't matter where your life is whether you're hitting rock-bottom or you on-top and want to improve.<br /><br />Apply techniques and change your life!
B003LPTB4M|5.0|I've had these headphones for over 5 years. I can only describe the quality of sound as perfect, limited only by the quality source. Everything from music to movies and explosive gaming sounds superb. Listening to BluRay movies is a real treat, especially during large scale action sequences. It's like having high quality speakers comfortably sitting on your ears.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It's truly amazing how she is able to intertwine so many character's lives together. I did not want to put this book down.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|THIS GAME IS TRULY ADDICTING. IT RUNS BEAUTIFFULY ON THE KINDLE FIRE. THE GAME KEEPS YOU ENTERTAIND AND I WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO ANYONE.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|since it's Sanderson it is better then most. but aside from the original idea and strong writing, I am not that curious about how it will continue, and that a bit of a miss.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A very .good Grissom read. I enjoyed the theme, the mystery, and the surprise ending.  If you like John Grissom, I highly recommend this book.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Its Iron Man, whats not to love?  It was three hours of action, comedy and sexy man all in one!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is good if you already have some basic knowledge about the language. Not ideal for completely new students. Very good app.
B00GUJP9PG|5.0|At the first time works but at the second day that i get the game it dosent wonna  work.<br />Give me my money back
1451695195|5.0|Very interesting book, read it in two days.  I was delivered on-time in perfect condition. This book covers a near death experience.
B0015RB72W|5.0|My absolutely favorite vinyl album. Didnt expect that the album is sooooo great! Listen to eat every other day with any kind of mood!
B00G70WLJA|3.0|the extra length is wasted on much empty action, equally banal dialogue, and...call me a chauvinist, but i prefer my damsels in distress to be prettier than their male opposites, including amazons...also, this is a plotline that has diverged sharply from the mutant theme, as i find it used slightly and with little imagination...SPOILER.....SPOILER.....SPOILER<br />.....also (again), we do not need to be told that jack's vow of peace will not outlast the first three scenes...which is just DULL...the &#34;surprise&#34; ending depends upon a passive acceptance, and is just as logically empty and cliche as the rest.  when an anticipated film opens and closes with little comment, that is nearly always an indication of mediocrity.jackman has always been the third star of the franchise, with capt. jean luc as the cynosure, but methinks the wolfman has been exhausted beyond the point of regeneration.
B00338QENI|4.0|Fantastic! easy read, rich in history and brings forth a personal touch to issues in science and ethics. I loved it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Opened the box. Plugged it in.  Watched YouTube on my TV.<br /><br />No set up, no problems, no gliches<br /><br />It's nice living in the future :-)
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I'm sure I would. love this app but......... I cant download it.it tells me I cant install it ppls comment me some help
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Henry Cavill was pleasant to look at and the movie started interesting enough, but it evolved into a confusing mess. It would have been better if they didn't use so many flashbacks to tell the story and rather continue the story from the beginning so when he displayed his superman powers it would have been exciting. Telling the origin story and developing that properly would have been good enough for starters. I was disappointed.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I love candy crush I was happy to find on my kindle I play it on my phone all the time so happy loving my Kindle more and more each day
B009NOVCTM|5.0|The sound quality is great & the song selection is also a good representation of The Rolling Stones but with so many great hits spanning their career the choice to put together a greatest hits must be hard. I am a Rolling Stones purest & picked this up for the new songs only as I already own all of their album's.  This is a irritating capitalist scheme that I wish they would stop. Same goes for Forty Licks I am forced to buy songs I already own to gain a couple of new songs. The Rolling Stones have way more greatest hits compilations than are necessary. I wish they would just put out a album with all new music instead of these greatest hits with a few extra new songs.  I love the Stones & realize they are getting older & it may take more time to put out a new album but we fans know that the glimmer twins are no spring chickens & would understand if it takes a longer time to put out a new album, but please just do it & call it \\"A Little Older & A Little Slower.\\" I think it was a foolish in devour to try and capture 5 decades of The Rolling Stones on three disc. Editing songs for time is just wrong, & it is this kind of handling of their music that keeps The Rolling Stones still in the shadow of the Beatles even after all these years!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My four year old plays it better than I do. Fun game. Easy but makes you think. All in all worth while.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Does any one know if this game will be able to play a nabi 2 my stepson love to play this game and he can't cause it sayingnir not compatable will it ever be compatable
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|my nice loves this app the sounds the cars make makes her giggle I was surprised how much she loved this app
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app really is great at keeping up with your Facebook friends and family.  I would recommend it to anyone that frequents this social media site.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Theo and Boris, strangely enough, are perfect post-modern anti-heroes. Horribly flawed, these motherless boys journey through their baffling teenage and young adult lives, gobbling all the drugs and slugging down all the vodka they can find.  But we still love them and want to see them survive despite their endless attempts at self-destruction.  It's  hard to read sometimes.<br /><br />Theo, fragile and cerebral, clings to the one thing that gives him a foundation and sense of meaning:  a painting.  Boris, covering any existential angst with a shroud of drugs and alcohol, is always close by, ready to share his life-numbing antidotes with his little pal, Theo.  New York, Las Vegas, and Amsterdam provide the backdrops for their physical and metaphysical displacement.<br /><br />It's a rollercoaster ride of a read, and we feel the underlying pain through Theo's eyes as he struggles to find his place in the world.  What do we do when the old foundations of religion, morality, and family have rotted away?  In this amoral, fragmented, and nonsensical world, is there anything that can anchor us?  That's a good question.
B004132HZS|5.0|Great Series.  This is an update of Sherlock Holmes bringing him into the present.  I was skeptical of the attempt to modernize Sherlock Holmes being a Holmes fan but it works and it is good.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I am so impressed with this kindle app can watch cartoons and vides no delay with main streaming love this kindle
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This is a very entertaining Halloween-themed movie, which our whole family enjoyed!  The characters are great, and it's one we go back to every Halloween.
B00DJ3ITKS|4.0|A well-researched and balanced view of an insanely clever man, the organization he built, and the profound impact it will have on consumers. Would've been worth five stars if the author had not meddled with Bezos' personal life - I don't see how that is relevant.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Overall this game is good, but the only part I didn't like about it is that you have to pay (99&cent;, $1.99) to get power-ups.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas per her request. She absolutely loves it and would highly recommend it. Not sure it's my cup of tea, but it certainly is hers, and she plans of sharing it with several of her girlfriends.
030759565X|5.0|If you're not familiar with Deb Perlman's food blog you are in for a treat with this cookbook. Filled with fun and fabulous recipes...I have yet to find one I haven't liked. Nothing too exotic ingredient wise but some innovative ideas along with good home cooking. One of my new favorites.
B009BDVD2Q|5.0|I read the library version of this book years ago. Our son, who is now learning the craft, seemed a likely audience. He says he enjoyed it and has read it thru a couple of times already. Like any writer, he has figured out some alternative ways to King's ideas, but as he says, it pays to pay attention to a master craftsman.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|Unreadable. I struggled through 'Sword of Truth', but lacked the fortitude to wade through more paper-thin characters and dull dialogue. Avoid.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas per her request. She absolutely loves it and would highly recommend it. Not sure it's my cup of tea, but it certainly is hers, and she plans of sharing it with several of her girlfriends.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Glimmers of brilliance but tedious and overly detailed. It was easy to know what was coming and where all the pieces fit. The idea and issues were thoughtful. Eggers doesn't fully capture the nuances of being a woman. Mae was not realistic just obnoxious.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game great way to pass time very fun and addicting I could play this game forever it's so fun very much like temple run but alike more fun!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|THERE IS NO OTHER RATING FOR THE BEATLES. HISTORY HAS PROVED THIS TO BE THE CASE. THEIR MUSIC SET A STANDARD.
B001FB55MG|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas per her request. She absolutely loves it and would highly recommend it. Not sure it's my cup of tea, but it certainly is hers, and she plans of sharing it with several of her girlfriends.
1589949811|5.0|I Love this game. It was definitely worth the purchase.  I really enjoy that you have the option of playing multiplayer and single player.
B00GRVV29E|5.0|Watch the vid on this and was ok something cool here I got a other app like this, once I started playing around and use headphones the music is immersive relaxing. I found myself like just zone out so relaxed doing all the different things , now u can control how the particles do and move and different things happen depending on how many fingers u have on the screen .there's so much u can mess wit on here u feel like your in control off a atom with all the particles, u can have just one or 9000 particles to mess wit at once plus u can change the length plus thickness of them so there's tons of things u can control. I got both hands on the screen and even that dose something good . Great on kindle fire HD no probs at all, sum it up u get this feeling of power over sub atomic particles u control but the music is so well done and it just had me relax messing wit everything. Hope this helped who ever reads this review I think alot of you would agree if u got this unique app.<br /><br />5 stars on this cause I can't find anything bad about it.<br /><br />Update.. I was the first too get this app mouths ago before it was faotd last week,I don't understand I gave a good review I won't think for all you but all this dislikes?? I think it's getting to where everyone want them top three spots and it's a shame because these reviews are by us for us to trust. 3/16/14
B008NMT684|1.0|If my son touches the game with more than one finger the game freezes and then the nabi freezes and I have to restart it.
006176759X|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas per her request. She absolutely loves it and would highly recommend it. Not sure it's my cup of tea, but it certainly is hers, and she plans of sharing it with several of her girlfriends.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|easy to setup and plays netflix wonderfully.  Very easy to use and am now planning 2 more for other TVs in the house.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome! I can't get my hands off of it. There are lots of cool levels and stuff to accomplish. I used to be a temple run fan, but it got boring because nothing changed. But, this app has a lot of different places to run, so you really should get it because it is awesome.
1932100660|5.0|This book has renovate my thinking about food. It really convinced me that I need to stay on an all plant based diet.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|In addition to everything Johnson says in his interview at the end of the book, I found this novel enlightens us about different realities that exist in tandem with our own.  Despite the chasm that lies between the U.S. And North Korea, Johnson explores the underlying emotions that bind all of us as human beings.  Much of the novel is an exercise in learning how to live in a reality that is so completely different than our own.  In order to appreciate the story to the fullest, we must not judge, but accept the lives of the characters as they unfold.  We feel for them, whether or not we understand them completely.  In a twist that is unexpected when beginning the read, we have the lens of the North Korean state focused upon us as Americans, judging us in the same way we judge them politically and culturally.  Johnson's lenses are crystal clear and we are forced to see ourselves in a different way, questioning if we can see ourselves clearly.  And yet, there is so much heartbreak in living as a member of the N. Korean state....
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really liked it but thought the ending could have been more significant.  Makes you realize that you really need to stop and think before you act.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is very addictive its a lit if fun I get sucked in so quick and play for hours
B005LAII80|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies of the year. Karl Urban rocks as Dredd, and Lena Heady is beautifully twisted as Ma-Ma, the ruthless crime boss.<br /><br />The film was excellently shot and the 'Slo-Mo' scenes are astonishing. I would definitely recommend this.
B007THA4FI|4.0|So, certainly not written in any similiar style as the Harry Potter series, very complex stories interwoven but at the end of the book, it was almost a &#34;who&#34; cares...I just didn't feel a connection with the characters.  It is an interesting read and a view into probably the social issues within England between the have and have nots, that part was very interesting, not so different from the US.  Just didn't think the character development was on par with the Harry Potter books where you really felt you got to know and care about them.<br /><br />But all in all an interesting read if not gripping.  If she wants to break out of the Harry Potter mode, definitely more work to be done.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Love it! It's an amazing search and find game. I love side quests also. I don't like all the crashes that happen when I try to go to a friend's game.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun game I would recommend this game to any and every one across the entire globe it's addicting once you start you don't want to put the game down
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Excellent collection of British comedy. A fabulously funny adaptation of novels to video. This is enjoyable family entertainment. Reminds me why I liked the musical By Jeeves so much.
B000FA675C|5.0|Gripping, can't put it down, can't figure out the plot story line.  Kept me on my toes from the start to finish and I love books that aren't predictable and this one sure wasn't.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved the character development. Great writing and very modern.  I definitely identified with the characters and fell in love
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|GREAT<br /><br />great graphics and everything its great I recommend this game to people who like to put time into their games and the game also has anwide enviorment of options
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable is just long enough have my Kindle Fire or phone plugged in and still be able to use my device. I use it with the Amazon Kindle 9W PowerFast Adapter for Accelerated Charging, sold separately. The reason why I love this cable compared to others is the Micro-USB connector is tight enough to stay firmly connected to my Samsung Galaxy S3, which is very picky about staying connected to charging cables.
0385351399|2.0|Note to self: Wait a bit for the reviews to come out.<br /><br />I read the NYT Magazine excerpt of The Circle and pre-ordered it from Amazon. I should have been content with the excerpt. Those who give this four and five stars must have read the second edition, which (I surmise) is 200 pages shorter and actually edited by a professional. This will probably make for a really great movie, I just hope it clocks in at under two hours!<br /><br />Yes, the premise is interesting. Very interesting, in fact. It's Eggers' endless repetitions that drag the book down. You know something is amiss when you say to yourself: \\"Oh! I can skip the next ten sentences without missing anything!\\"
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|because we really liked the movie, always like Denzel Washington, the actor. However, I am irritated by having to type this response, why can't we just enjoy a without having to send a message ?
B00005JLKB|5.0|not much to say about the actual product only that it came undamaged and sealed. i actually like the show if you want to know, i will consider buying season 2
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great.  Cable charges faster than my old one and stays plugged in.  I am very pleased with it.  Thanks.
B000L53D4O|5.0|This is a very stable walker. I bought two for my twin grandsons . They are 1 yr old. They can navigate easily
B005UKK4Y2|1.0|Bad movie. Worse plot. Not funny. No where near funny. I want my money back! Didn't even watch it all.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Interesting, well made series. I enjoyed watching the first season and look forward to viewing all the other seasons soon

B00FLDG42Y|5.0|For the acclaimed power trio, Rush, 2013 has been a banner year. Now in their fourth decade as a touring and recording juggernaut, the Canadian musicians were finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall and Fame, and have just released a new triple live disc commemorating their highly successful \\"Clockwork Angels Tour.\\"<br /><br />With over three hours of material culled from their twenty studio albums, bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and &uuml;ber drummer Neil Peart are joined on stage for the first time by a string ensemble, used generously throughout the studio release of \\"Clockwork Angels.\\" Even with a third of the package dedicated to the string-infused new material, the band still give their fans plenty of their classic tracks, including \\"Big Money,\\" \\"2112,\\" and \\"Spirit of Radio.\\" However, they also delve deeper into several of their older albums, adding songs like \\"Territories,\\" \\"Middletown Dreams,\\" and \\"Body Electric\\" into the three-hours of material. No fewer than three different drum solos are included from Peart, each one in a unique style from the others, and all exemplifying the talents that have made the master drummer one of the top tier musicians in the world.<br /><br />The string section supports the new material well, but concertmaster David Campbell has also created new arrangements for the additional players in several of the band's older hits.  The majority of this new sound is functional, but the highlight is in the band's premiere instrumental, \\"YYZ,\\" where the string players are allowed to contribute more equally to the jam, and truly add a welcomed new dimension to the 1981 hit from the group's \\"Moving Pictures\\" album.<br /><br />The sound quality on the disc is much better than on some of the band's past live recordings, and this, along with the new string arrangements make this album a must-have for the legions of Rush fans who may have grown tired of the quantity of live material the band has released.ive material the band has released.
B000005JA8|5.0|I grew up in the boonies far from any radio station or culture at all, never heard music before. One day walking down the dirt road I found a copy of this record and a phonograph wrapped up in an old cardboard box. Took my new found treasures home and figured out how to play a record.<br />Since this was the only record I owned I listened to it over and over and fell in love with it. My parents hated it with a passion, that made it even better.<br />It shaped my taste in music for the next 50 years, My very next album, that I had to buy on a trip to the city, was The Mother's Freak Out. Bought it because of the cover.<br />I was well on my way to becoming a true music connoisseur.

B00C1BU8G2|3.0|This one just couldnt compare to the first. The suspense wasnt there. Decent storyline but as with most movies they should have stopped at one.

B00CTKHXFO|5.0|It's the best collection of my favorite video game franchise. Worth every penny. It would have been nice to include the psp games with it, but it doesn't take away much of the story if you're trying to follow it.
B00E32507O|4.0|It is a good read, with elements of history, humor, and memorable characters. Very well written, as well. I think I will share my copy with my daughter, who was not alive in this historical time.

B00EW9GQR6|3.0|Nowhere near the quality music we're used to from Gaga.  The video from &#34;Applause&#34; is mesmerizing, but where's the song?  There's nothing like &#34;Judas,&#34; &#34;Bad Romance,&#34; &#34;Born This Way,&#34; &#34;Telephone,&#34; or even &#34;Teeth&#34; here.  It may grow on me, but I'm having a difficult time getting beyond a couple of listens.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Classic movie and Blu-ray AND Digital is a recipe for success. The Dark Knight is the  very definition of epic!
B00BATG18K|5.0|Long awaited book. I have always loved her story telling. This may be my new favorite . Please don't wait so long for the next one.
0307291146|5.0|It was a great price for both books.  So fun to see the original version of Julie Child's many years of work on these cookbooks.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle continues the Android Suite.  Interesting and different.  Could do without the radio patter.  Still, a unique talent - singer, dancer, fashionista.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Easy to learn. Fun to play and win at the entry level of the game. The game feedback sights are not over powering.
B0000669JL|5.0|This is my go-to CD for my one year old!  He bops around his playroom... and who doesnt love Bob Marley?  We listen to this daily and love it every time!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I LOVE solving mysteries, and Sherlock Holmes is the best ever.  There will never be another Sherlock Holmes.  I have never heard of any cases he has failed to solve.
147676459X|5.0|Allie Brosh is one of the great minds of my generation, indisputably.  Through both the funny and the sad moments, her writings helped me, a fellow introvert, figure out what was going on in my own head better than anyone ever had.  Thank you Allie!
B00GQ7OZR0|2.0|worst ending ever.  Felt like the writers just didn't care and threw it all away ...i could have written a better ending.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Good little caddy for our BabyJogger.  please with the quality to price ratio.  The top edge has a wire running around it so it keeps its shape for the most part.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am a retired police officer from an inner city.  A city that has all the ills of most inner cities today.  I have seen my share of tragedy, wasted lives and certainly needless death.  I comforted the survivors and hunted down the guilty.<br /><br />Believe me when I tell you that you never leave those memories behind.  Those ghosts hide in your minds rafters and constantly shiver and simmer just waiting to fall out with slightest bit of help form currant daily tragedies.<br /><br />But over time you kid your self that you've toughened up. Emotions don't hurt so much and other things just aren't as funny or as much fun anymore.<br /><br />However, this book shook all those ghosts and demons right out of those cranial hide aways and brought those stomach rendering bastards face front .<br /><br />Without shame I  admit that tears flowed down my cheeks as I read this book. Never thought of death as a partner or as an entity that could care one way or another. Never gave Nazies much thought as people with  redeemable souls. This is an  opportunity to  see and hear the HOLOCAUST from a different perspective.<br /><br />The word crafting is on par with Hemingway ,Faulkner,and any other of the great story tellers.<br /><br />I would give this author ten stars if possible.**********
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|A wonderful game, but was unable to continue playing it because of an in game flaw that killed my character before the level could even start. My sister, who also downloaded the game on her kindle also had this problem on the exact same level (it's the level where it switches to a western/desert scene)<br />I hope they see this and are able to fix the flaw! Other then the killing flaw that makes it so you can't go any further in the game.. it's still a fun game... Up to that point anyway.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|It was a perfect fit for my Nikon lens 18-55mm. Very pleased with the product and would recommend buying this lens hood
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game  , don't have any problems with it love the sounds(ring around the rosey) lol maybe add a a little more eerie sounds lol
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|it is a game that lets your imagination run. plus when you time it right you can play with friends. MAGES,FIGHTERS,GAURDIANS,AND SUPPORTERS!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I first saw this game when my brother had it on his Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere. It's really good for people who like to waste a lot of time. And a lot less childish then Blooms Tower Defence. :D
B000WEMH3C|2.0|This is not a very heavy duty cover.  If I had known it was this thin I would have purchased the more expensive version.  I'm thinking one of the other types would last two or three times as long as this one.  I would not recommend purchasing this cover.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The way the author wrote the story is unusual;it makes the reading exceptionally interesting with the change of voice echoing throughout the book.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Felt like a bit long of a read, but very informative and thorough, so it's justified.  Hope to see more from the author.
B005WMQ5R8|4.0|great movie just not enough extras. if you like anime buy it if your a die hard fan like me who loves looking at the extras then maybe find one with another disk.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Thought about this movie all the next day after watching!  This is the perfect DVD to watch over the Holidays!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Strong ending wrapped up the story but not a five star rating like Hunger Games or Harry Potter because the writing is not as tight and sophisticated.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So much fun with no fear. Great game &amp; thanks for making it free. Saves me from actually buying a Jeep.
B00B1RB942|5.0|ill admit there is no real need for blueray with anime but you get it here at a good price and you get a tone of interviews with both the blueray and dvd witch is awsom. nice case and box are all the stuff you want with an anime movie
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was very hard to put down.  It tugged at my heart. Was on my mind anytime I had to put it down.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|To avoid missing a picture taken or saving a document (in your tablet or ipad), do yourself a favor and buythis product.<br />It's very handy and useful for electronic gadgets such as digicam, ipad, ipod, iphone and even laptop. You wont have to worry about &#34;oh my! My digicam's battery is empty, i can't take a picture of ____ (anymore)&#34;.
0316055433|5.0|Sometimes when I read a book I have a thought, &#34;oh, I should be a writer, I could have written this&#34;.  Not because I think myself so clever, but because the story is imaginable, the prose  - while it may be good - is as you would expect it to be, with descriptions, metaphors and images that are all right there at the tip of your mind when you read them.<br /><br />Well, not this book.  This book is so well crafted and the imagery so rich and well articulated it is an absolute joy to read the writing while the story itself is completely engrossing.  The characters are detailed and know-able, and the narrator utterly believable - even when you want to reach into the words and shake him to do something other than what he is doing.  There is deep philosophy, undying love, coming of age, suspense danger and intrigue, oh - and art.<br /><br />The story spools out at such a clever pace that when things speed up and slow down - as they must in an 800 page book - the tempo is easy to maintain and I was carried along without a hitch.  I could write more here, but why waste your time reading my review?  Go read the book! You won't be sorry.
B00004U8JU|5.0|It's exactly what I expected: the DTS widescreen Collector's Edition of Jurassic Park (2000 DVD release). Just FYI, THX says it's a THX-certified release, but I don't see the THX logo play when I play the DVD. (It doesn't appear on the DVD cover, either, although some THX-Certified DVDs like William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet and The Thin Red Line don't show the THX logo on the cover).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled hosseini is easily my favorite author. He truly has a gift when it comes to story telling, and he's done it again beautifully in this loving story about family, love, and life lessons.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|THIS GAME IS A GREAT GAME FOR KIDS TEENS OR ADULTS. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO HUNT. HOP  YOU ENJOY
B007STXHTM|5.0|Definitely a must have for underwater videos. It really does pull the light in a lot more than you would expect. It also frees up the regular housing for modification for an external mic since this comes with an entire housing as well. Now I have a waterproof housing and a non waterproof housing with a great mic.
0307010856|5.0|I'm a bit older than the intended audience for this book and I remember reading it when it first came out. This is still a favorite of mine that makes me chuckle whenever I fit a bit blue. Who doesn't love Grover? Children loved it when it came out and I can imagine they still do.<br />Overall, this is a cute book and cute read and I have no hesitation recommending for the children in your life or the child in you.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Very catching can't stop reading book. No loose ends. Story goes very logicaly and is speeding up so you can't drop it.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have just become an Alfie fan.  He is truly magnificent in the role of Jean Valjean. I am now purchasing Alfie's albums.
B00G5G7EXY|5.0|I took both my kids - 3yr old girl and 14 yr old boy - to see this today and they both loved it. This is the first movie that my youngest did not take a bathroom break in the middle. I enjoyed the in-depth story line which is missing in many kid movies. Kudos to Disney for making a movie the entire family can enjoy.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|The Doctor is back but after saving so many he couldn't save his fellow Time Lords from final destruction and holds himself as much responsible for their passing as the Daleks who attacked his home world, Gallifrey. Is something more than grief and loss behind his guilt? Watch and find out...
B00CE03UOC|5.0|nice game.  I enjoy playing.  the game has many different levels to play and they get harder as you go.<br />laura
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Very fluid, story is realistic, the way I see it the moral compass is there you just have to accept it in the movie
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|We've been on a low carb diet for a few years now, but I never understood how bad gluten is for us.  Totally a must read for everyone.  I wish our medical personnel would understand how bad carbohydrates are for us and start prescribing a healthier diet to people instead of all this medication!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|unlike any other romance. read it and love it. a top author to add to your must read list. I heartily recommend this book.

1843106698|5.0|Very good and complete guide from one of the pioneers in the field. His earlier book Aspergers Syndrome is I think better for parents as it's simpler and more concise but still with very helpful guidelines to address all the issues.
B005LAII8K|5.0|The story isn't like anything I've seen thats been told so great. The characters make you really give in to the movie as well.
B001QJUX24|5.0|Loved it!  A good book and background story about one of my favorite movies and actors.  Puts the whole thing in perspective.
B002361MLA|5.0|To put it simply, it turned my life around. A paradigm shift needed to be back to the world, to be present the closest thing to emotional panacea.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can not get minecraft 8.0 on kindle fire y can I not get it only on android make it on kindle fire!!!

B0083P1QUM|4.0|I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and this one is better than some of the last ones. The plot is intriguing and remains so until the end.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jackson is one of the few artists with true talent.  No gimmicks, no flash, just raw talent.  The bluegrass album is no different
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting and so glad it's on kindle now.<br />I'm writing this review as I wait out getting a life so I can play again.<br />It is alot of fun. Enjoy.
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|I felt the movie was a hollow &#34;hollywood production&#34;, made to produce revenue, using a well known star (Jennifer Aniston). The  basic premise of the movie, a drug dealer, illegally importing drugs into the US, as the &#34;hero&#34;, was shallow and ill conceived. Jennifer Aniston also added to the rudimentary basics, as a stripper, showing off her body, for the simple monetary benefit of the movie and herself. In the end we were all duped into purchasing this, as best, socially lame comedy. I was sorry I rented it....and sorrier for Jennifer that she made it.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I liked the story but found the writing style a bit annoying and cutesy. I was surprised because several friends said they loved it. I thought it was just okay.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I really enjoyed this book 3/4 of the way through.  Then all of these characters got introduced and it got so complex it was hard to follow.  It felt like the author got tired of writing and just quickly ended the book.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|When are we getting Draw Something 2 on Kindle? Hardly anyone plays this one anymore since the sequel is out.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is completely AWESOME, but one morning, I went into minecraft to play it because I was bored. All of my worlds were gone. I tried everything. But it didn't work. I went onto mojang.com to see if i could contact them, BUT I DON'T HAVE A TWITTER ACCOUNT! Seriously, there are some people who don't have a twitter account Do you guys at mojang not have an email address? Also, the screenshots for this app are outdated. And how many letters does a stupid password have to be when you're making a mojang account? (See tobuscus's password rant) (No, I'm not tobuscus) Minecraft pe in very good, but i don't know why it did that.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game  items are a little over priced but lots of fun better than original game  would be great to get free item every so often
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game. It has so many different scenes. If u like stuff like temple run its like that without the tilting
B00FLNQBTK|5.0|I loved this movie. I laughed out loud on several occasions. It is raunchy and funny and silly all at the same time. If you can have an open mind and you laugh at inappropriate humor then you will like this movie. If not, then it may not be for you. k
B001K3K5MO|5.0|Classic movie that just keeps getting better with age.  A young Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer light up the screen in the film that defined their young stardom.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Great Music!! One of the best CD's A7X has put out....Miss the Rev but new drummer seems fine...Buy it now!!

B00DQAM5LI|5.0|This CD is Great  A much heavier sound  at the moment the song Planets is playing in my head  there are so many signature riffs in these songs I would say 8 out of the 10 songs are awesome  the other 2 are pretty good.  a lot of albums only have a couple of good ones
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|An engrossing story that is extremely well-written and gap-free. Had not read John Grisham recently and this one reminded me that I need to!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book! The only problem was I couldn't put it down. Mr.<br /> Howley has a wonderful ability to grab your attention and leave you wanting more.  I can't wait to read more of his work.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Some of the &#34;games&#34; or challenges on here run a little slow, but overall its a simple way to brush up on motor skills. I enjoy the number blocks helps me improve my multi-tasking capability.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I loved the story--the characters--the universe Geo Martin has created. The writing is colorful and crisp--delightful! The story does wind up getting a bit bogged down in names and histories--my own criticism, and one I have heard echoed by others. Overall--a satisfying and compelling read!
B008NB2GI2|5.0|Positively THE most exciting historical novel I have ever read. I cannot recommend this more highly. If there were 10 stars I'd give it that.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I loved this game but it got an awful glitch the control buttons became invisible  I could not see what<br />I was doing. Other than that it's a really fun game with great grafics
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Thanks Henry Cavill, now that my wife has seen you without your shirt on...guess who has to start working out. Just Kidding. I am a huge fan of Superman and if you love the comic books then you will no doubt enjoy this film. I am a fan of Zack Snyder's work especially with The Watchmen, 300, Dawn of the Dead etc. and Man of Steel takes the Superman franchise to the next level. Can't wait for the next Superman installment.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I recommend this book.  it was a great story n a good mystery.  I love all his books and look forward to each one
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone loves to play this game and so am I...you'll never get tired of playing it...I'm glad it's available now at kindle fire...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a very fun game and a good way to pass some time.  Good eye-hand coordination skills developed.<br />Kudos to whomever created this game.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is addictive however I do not like the fact you only get 5 lives then you have to either beg for lives or pay for them. I understand why people would spend a small fortune for this game but I refuse to &#34;beg&#34; or &#34;pay&#34; for lives, that's addiction man. I play this occasionally and if I do run out of lives I just quit playing. The game itself is fantastic and could be better if you want to pay for it. I play on the kindle fire and it runs really well, I just hate that you have to pay for lives.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Intelligent writing and very good acting. it keeps you interested and laughing. it is also original, and the outcomes are very surprising.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Inspirational book - loved the fact that she was flawed and honest and open about it; made her very real in this true story of courage and growth.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is a great game. I like the upgrades and the many choices for players and skateboards.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is exactly what I needed. It is big, bold and EASY to operate. Simplicity of use makes it the big winner here. So many other apps are more than what an average user really needs. It is perfect on my Kindle Fire and I use it to do monthly bills. You can't miss with this one!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nice looking app and put together well.  It is challenging to move up w/o spending $$$.  They should let you replay hunts to earn $$$.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large keyboard and display are the strong features here. This calculator also keeps a running display of your last entry in case you forgot what you did last. I highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just simply a lot of fun!  Enjoy the way stages vary.  Had heard about this game for some time.  Finally downloaded it to my kindle and have enjoyed it a lot.
B00G32TD98|4.0|A horror flick, that is actually scary. Plus its based on a true event, which adds to the imagination. Great storyline

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved how Peeta and Katniss get back together and have children. I like how the games end and Katniss and Peeta have each other forever. I dislike Gale going away and not being able to know the kids name. I HATE how Prim dies. I recommend this book to anyone who can handle a sad terrible story and a little happiness. I gave it 5 stars because it had an awesome amazing plot and just flowed amazingly. I love these books so so very much! &#60;3
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|This book usually sells for $6.83 but Amazon offered it to me for $1.99. At that price, I could not resist!<br /><br />The protagonist is sweet, awkward, hilariously flawed, and with just enough self-awareness to keep herself from floating away. The plot veers from farce to romantic comedy to a (predictable) oh-no-i-must-be-serious-now passage. In lesser hands, this would be formulaic -- but Sophie Kinsella makes it work. A few chapters disappointed me, but the book is so determined to please the reader, it would be uncouth of me to mention those parts.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This lets you build your piggies vehicles its very fun it's worth it play I am a fan of angry birds.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Fascinated with the class system in England, and the wealth and life-style. Not necessarily agreeing with it, but it is interesting from a historical perspective. I find the plot twists now predictable, and unbelievable. Ie: Mr Bates' life is good one minute, but give it another minute, in the same episode, and his happy life is now in doubt. These predictable plot twists are becoming tiring. I will still watch, as I enjoy seeing the different technology making its way into these wealthy lives (automobiles, telephones, medicine, etc); the beginning of the modern age.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I've played Spider on my computer many times and wanted it on my Kindle too.<br />I keep my favorite games on there and I like the ones by Brainium.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I love this author. He is a great story teller. This book is well grounded in science, but the science is in the background. The plot is well paced and very suspenseful.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app sucks I hate it its boring as the Yankees sweated to be glad that God canlead your computer to the old republic angry birds
B008602KQI|2.0|I know this is a popular movie, but for me, I just don't relate or like the surreal, and morbid. I found me forcing myself to watch the whole movie. I guess perhaps, it is a little like David and Goliath. They were chosen to fight in lieu of armies going to battle. Unfortunately this time Goliath was also a good guy(s) (other children). Conflict brings the worst out in people. Would it not be better to resolve conflict through love, instead of fighting?
B00005LC1H|5.0|Funniest UK sitcom ever conceived and produced!  Uproariously funny!  Cleese had hit his stride.  The entire cast of characters and situations is nothing short of genius and brilliantly innovative.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I played and love every level. Stunning graphics. Lovely music. Nice story. The vintage replies are awesome. I'm going to  increase the difficulty and play it again.<br />Love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this game i play all the time every day i would highly recommend this game to anyone any age<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Great, well balanced knife. Holds the blade sharpness very well. Nice wide blade at the top gives it the weight you need to chop small trees. Just what I was looking for.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I've only watched half of the 1st season but so far, I'm enjoying it and looking forward to watching ALL the episodes. My young nephews also love the shows so it's great fun discussing the different episodes with them. Can't wait for several cold wintery days so I can have the excuse to stay in and have a Dr Who marathon.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I am a PA working in this fractured health care system.  I &#34;preach&#34; these concepts daily.  It would be helpful to have a shortened synopsis of the principles to hand out to patients.  I find they are quickly overwhelmed with the &#34;contradicting&#34; information.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I loved the game, its very addicting,but exciting at the same time. I recommend it to everyone who likes a good puzzle. The only complaint I have is that it's a bit short, I can't wait for the second one to come out. But it's definitely worth $1.99
B007DIQC90|5.0|I can listen to it over and over.<br />Each song is different from the others.<br />I look forward to another album.
B00FMJJ064|5.0|The music is upbeat and great to listen to working out or just for fun. I listen when out skating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVED by my 7 n 9 year old  boys!  Do I need say more?  They have played this for months.
0763660531|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It really reminds you how story is told through pictures and really opened up my son's imagination. Only problem is he tried to draw a door on our home wall with a red crayon after!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is an awesome scary game. If you like investigating and scary stuff then this is the game for you.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|I like sci fi but this dumb corny.  They should have left the love story out and stuck with interesting graphic imagery.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My husband is addicted!  He and my sons plays it often.  What else do I need to say? There are lots of levels and you can earn coins you can use to buy guys.
B004J4X32U|5.0|Perfect gift for seasoned parents and newbies alike, incredible clear ideas and teaching that accomplishes its initial premise, you´ll gain better understating of your kid´s mind and also yours
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Definitly a must have. Really addicting and such a fun game. I recommend to any tower defense fans that have been looking for a good td game
0345803493|5.0|Great book especially on the weekends my husband was gone. I hate being interrupted when I am reading a good book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 9 year old says 3 stars.  I say 5 because I like to play it every chance I get to use their kindle which is about 5 min a day! It is addicting.  My 5 year old agrees with 5 stars.  There are TONS of levels and different games to play.<br />My 9 yo says once you get up to 8x8 It gets harder and harder and he thinks some of the levels are not possible.  Lol
1878424319|5.0|I love this book on every level.  I always have.  I purchased this copy as I'd given away my previous one to someone who I felt could do with reading it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game,you really have to use your head and think things though.<br />The whole family can play and try to out think each other.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|Eeh, there are a LOT of songson here that I've never heard of or don't care for.  It is a nice collectors item though.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 7 and 9 year old have had this for months and play it off and on.  It is not one of their favorites but an old standby.  My husband plays it a lot too.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|For the price, this is a good deal. There aren't a lot of choices in this price range that will deliver as much sound quality as this little gem.  Go For It..
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Could have more puzzles but overall it was cool.  The graphics was awesome and the l enjoyed the game very much.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Amazing set! Just what i was looking for. You get all the Alien Movies 1-4 plus the making of all the movies, plus a bunch of extras. If you love the series this is a must have!!!
B0058VW36U|3.0|Very challenging game for my 9 year old.  He does not like it because its hard..  I find it too challenging for me.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|One of the best books on personality I have ever read.  Cain brings in much relavant research but frames most with real people stories which makes the reading much easier.  Both introverts and extraverts can enjoy and learn from this book.  Isuspect the author would be a very good dinner companion.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I thought I would not like this game, but since it was the FAOTD, I took a chance.  It had an amazing storyline, and fun gameplay. Only complaint I had was that its so short! Loved it! :)
B00EJX2YGM|4.0|This set was an obvious ploy to make more money but as a crazy fan I decided to buy anyway.  The box is really interesting and the pictures are nice.  It's a great collector set, but since I already owned all five movies... I was really looking forward to the special features.  There was not as much behind the scenes with the three main actors as I was hoping.  I wanted to see them joking around and messing up their lines.  There was little of that.  There weren't even many interviews by Pattinson, Stewart, or Lautner that were new for this disk set.  After 5 movies there must be so much gag reel kind of content... why couldn't they put more in?  Or more deleted scenes?  The longest bonus feature on the new disk was about the Twihards and FanFiction craze.  I didn't need to see that... I live it every day!  I wanted more of the joking around and conversation between the actors.  I felt like this was a tribute to Wick Godfrey. He dominated the bonus footage.  I got up from the couch happy with the purchase, but looking back I expected more.
B00E9A656K|5.0|My 9 year old loves this game because you can earn money by racing and then change and paint cars.  Shifting gears to win games is challenging.  He says you will get used to it.  Each race gets harder and harder.  Daily challenges every day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game. fun and frustrating. can get costly when u get stuck but worth the dollar life refilled or boosters. completely recommend if u like puzzle games
B008220C38|4.0|Akey to the historical myths of Russia. People act in accord with each other no matter their position in society.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I love this book because it entertains me. I wish it got to the point but it keeps u hooked.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|I totally recommend it! It's a little confusing at first but you get the hang of it. Great game for 6 &amp; Up. I'm 14 and I love it. Its a game that kills time.. I bought it with my coins but it's definitely worth the 99&cent;. ( go buy austin mahone's banga banga on itunes)
B003Y5USF0|1.0|What the heck! I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriends Birthday because he loves this movie so much. It arrived on time, but he told me that there was no plastic wrap on the DVD case. Item was listed as brand new!! Only a piece of tape was holding it closed!! He then put it in his DVD player and five minutes in the movie froze!!! He tried everything he could and it still doesn't play!! What a rip off. So mad.
B008JFUN6E|3.0|Anticipating a decent sci-fi, I was disappointed overall:<br /><br />The good:  CGI (not exceptional).<br /><br />The bad: shallow predictable plot (not very well connected), lots of unnecessary swearing, very District 9-like but not as good, no chemistry between Matt D and his &#34;girl&#34; or even Jodie F and others (I really expected a good film with favourites JF and MD both in it), predictable scenes, pretty limited vocal part for an actress of JF's talents, pretty average acting all round actually. Throw in the usual South African mercenaries with one brain cell to shore up the &#34;action&#34;... Oh, the robots are also quite antiquated in structure, acting, and vocals.<br /><br />If you want to see both MD and JF in decent films, I enjoyed his Spielberg film about the tsunami and other related human stories (highly emotive and great, passionate acting). The same goes for JF's Flight Plan : excellent. But in this film, neither are going to win Oscars for either acting or roles and the whole sci-fi film is a very average watch with telly-tubbyish ending. The old Star Trek films had much better stories and more bite (and real acting). Even Oblivion was better, albeit with Tom Cruise in it...a poorer actor to either of the stars here by a fair way but he seemed to have done a slightly better job.<br /><br />With all the resources at hand for film producers, I wonder why there are no worthy sci-fi for years. The Fifth Element by talented Luc Besson is so much better than Elysium in every way...and of similar story ilk but more expansive and far more interesting (and funny).
B0093QHWLC|3.0|This was a hard movie to watch, almost depressing.  The acting was very good, however the content was hard at times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book it was full of suspense and action. I was really surprised when Gale said there is no District 12. I recommend this book to anybody who loves the Hunger Games as much as I do. I can't wait for the next book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|the game is fun, you use your mind eye coordination and it's challenging as you go through the different levels
1451666179|5.0|Cake, letters to one's future self, depression, dogs...No one makes me laugh through my nose in front of other people like Allie Brosh does.  Genius!
B0013F1D02|5.0|Beautiful picture and sound delivered to my iPad and a heart-warming story with some excellent, and sometimes surprising, good humor.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works smoothly  nice personalization capabilities  well worth the . Upgrade price  downloads and sets up easily and quickly  worth fivE stars
0060581808|5.0|This is a wonderful book, I have read it to my children many many times. Then they read all the Laura books on their own when they were old enough.<br />I am looking for an older edition that has more pictures in it.  I have the rest of the set, but this one volume got damaged.  The edition for sale here has far fewer illustrations than the Scholastic Books version I had.<br />For those who don't know: this is the first book in Laura's series, and it was written for a younger audience. She originally wrote the books for the amusement of younger family members.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy the game play, it allows you to filter to just the outer edges so you can easily find those and you can decide weather to allow the prices to rotate or not.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for decades for this game ti come out on amazon app store. I finally go to the app store and I see it!
B00GIZO674|5.0|So...I've  been playing this game for awhile now and I'm starting to see all the signs of addiction (sweaty palms when my Kindle isn't in my hands, skipping homework in favor of playing Burger Shop, etc.) If you like any type of cooking/fast paced game, this is the game for you. Now, to get back to it...
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Creepy creepy creepy. Love Kevin Bacon!!  What a villain how can good ever win over him?  Whoa! Sucks you in.
009950569X|5.0|Great book with usable information from the first page. Applies to both written and digital communications to help create memorable ideas. The book is written and organized well, so it's easy to apply the knowledge you gain.
006202406X|1.0|This author better get the most out of these books because her career is over. First, you don't kill off your main character in a YA category. Her readers will hate her. And second, if you do, you need ingenious. By far, the biggest waste of my time.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|the twistswere done verywell. there are onlya handful ofmovies that i haven't figured out the plot, andending within15-20&#34; into the movie.thiswas1 such movie. natalie portman was as usual deeply intoher character, i find this surprising for a girl with a 4 point gpa in neuroscience/psychology.dianne matthews
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Interesting take on Sherlock.  Love Watson!!  Not sure about Sherlock he's just a bit too disordered. Again watch it for Watson
B0083Z614S|4.0|Good reads come in all guises. The Secret Garden,long part of children's literature, has many lessons for adults as well. Norman Vincent Peal couldn't tout positive thinking better.
B00CNIDH7A|5.0|So many songs on one CD, about an hour.  Didn't realize that the lyrics are almost comical in some of the songs. Enjoy the CD every day.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am a fan of the Ice Age movies. When I noticed the game, I liked it. I loved the Scrat themed games. A wonderful cute arrangement of animals. It is a lot like LPS and Sims into one. My favorite is the dinosaurs. GET IT NOW GET IT NOW GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345530578|1.0|It is not as good of a book as the other books by Grisham. The main character is not very likable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is fantastic and a must read. It is even better on the second , or third, run through.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is one of the best books on Alzheimers I have read.  I have two parents that live with me that have Alzheimers.  This book helped me understand a little more what was going on in their minds.  Lisa really nailed Alice.  It made me feel like Lisa was living in Alice's mind.  If you know someone with Alzheimers or Dementia, you must read this book.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This game is always a good game but this time it stunk I tried to move the pipes but they wouldn't if you want to know what I think don't get it it will stink
B00BMNM4H6|1.0|I'm sure it's an enjoyable game for some. However, I have a low attention span and was bored within about 10-20 minutes.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Very addictive!  Like the ability to pencil in possible solutions and the ability to try different layouts.  Haven't tried them all, but there is a lot of variety to keep you interested.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time, I nearly shut it off twice but wanted to see if there was going to be a redeeming ending, but in my opinion there wasn't.  I liked Denzel Washington in his early days but he has gone downhill and isn't worth watching any longer.  It's not his acting that's bad, it's his choice of content.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|really comes in handy when you din't habe an actual flashlight. it's bright  and  serves it's purpose. nuf said...get it
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|VERY entertaining like really. They put so much detail in it<br />Good goals and details so much guns are socialized into the game
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|Had more favorite songs than I realized. Includes some of their more recent songs. Music that makes you sit back and think a little bit harder about life.
B0040I09RM|5.0|It keeps you guessing and asking questions while getting to know characters who are much more complicated than they first appear.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|decent game, it just didn't captivate me. maybe If i played it more i.ll get into it. great graphics though!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|every time start playing I get addicted....I cant put the game down. I have played all the other catagories I upkeep they developed more
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best. Temple run and subway surfers just cant beat you. I just cant seem to put this game down. At night i play it and say to myself &quot;one more run&quot; but end up doing it the rest of the night.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Poetic, lovely--I couldn't wait to get back to it, yet I never wanted it to end.  For book lovers and story tellers everywhere.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I heels off a long time to get this and now Imam obsessed with completing levels with 3 stars. Really enjoying it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Simple to use.  Effective at cleaning up my residue on my Kindle Fire HD.  Over 800 mb removed.  I have a more responsive system now.
B00CE03UOC|1.0|So glad I got this the day it was free, otherwise I would really be more disapointed. The game really isn't that fun or challanging and between the adds and the constant nagging to rate the app or share on Facebook, I would really advise skipping this one
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Wow!! This was the greatest baby toy I ever bought. It works incredible. At the office, no worries I can see my baby. Across the country, no worries I can see my baby. AWESOME!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Good book, I really liked it, but it was very sad, it made me cry.  I enjoy reading books that leave me with a good feeling, this one left me feeling depressed.  But I'm  glad I read it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|5/2017 Update - I've been playing for quite a while and am now frustrated that every time I finish a search I get an offer to buy something and it tries to connect to the &#34;app&#34; store and locks up.  I used to be able to play one scene after another without have to resent.  Now it goes each time to try to sell me something (I don't want that something) and won't connect or let me cancel. Losing a star for this development  Like the length of play and the challenge of this game.  I have spent a small amount of additional money bit only a couple dollars  Fare cost for such a good, challenging, and fun game. Well done
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have not read a more original book in my lifetime. It is a masterful synthesis of creativity and history, and, for the life of me, I cannot imagine how Hollywood will successfully adapt it to the screen. A fascinating read.<br />VICTOR L Mote, Houston,Texas
B000YMHOUS|2.0|Too long a movie with same plot-kinda of redundant. In other words, no change in plot except adding a little bit of color after a few scenes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a truly enjoyable game, and it is huge...  This will take a long time to finish... pretty challenging as well...  I wish lives came faster is my only drawback...
B00G9QLP9Y|1.0|Downloaded the app and aside from only getting a half screen view, there isn't even a street view option available. Total waste of space on my kindle.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book had amazing writing and idea. I won't spoil, but the ending is quite surprising. Read to find out!
0393327345|5.0|This Book is what got me HOOKED on Chuck Palahniuk. I love this guy. The subtle differences between the novel and the movie seem irrelevant because when I was reading the book I didn't think about Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, I think about depressed peopkle from my life which makes the book more personal. Chuck Palahniuk!!!!! Damned my heterosexuality. I love Chuck Palahniuk but, unfortunately not in the gay homosexual way. Love is Love. I have all his books.
B00F0AI9Y4|4.0|I almost never listen to edm but give track 3 a chance if you heard &#34;wake me up&#34; on the radio and liked that single. To be honest, I only like the first four tracks and the remaining tracks seem more EDM-ish to me. Still, a good buy at the Black Friday deal price: I've already listened to &#34;hey brother&#34; 10 times today.<br /><br />I normally listen to pop, modern country, or classical.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|It's soOoo FLUFFFY!!!!  Despicable Me is destined to be a new classic.  I can't watch this movie enough.  I already have it on amazon instant, but wanted a disc I could take when visiting my family and friends with kids, so we could watch together!
B00GINENG0|5.0|I love this app! It's not hard or anything. Also in the whole thing it's just  awesome.But my  opinion Tom looks weird kid size.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|That comes from my 6 year old! ;)<br />Cool entertains my son and I actually have to limit the time he can play! He loves it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would this series over and over again it makes you wonder how it would be if it was real
B0015DYIH2|3.0|It was like the best book ever, in the Beginning. Then Stephanie caged it up and I was confused. I like the first part and first movie of breaking dawn better.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My son loves this movie and I find that I do too!  Very enjoyable &#34;cars&#34; characters & a cute story.  He has enjoyed watching watching this since he was about 1.5 years old, so over a year now.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|Not what I thought it would be.it is just not for me. Thank you but no thank you. I'll pass.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I seriously hated this ended other than thAt it was a good book. not as exciting as the others but good.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|After finishing this book, I have the same haunted feelings as I imagine the narrator has been trying to share. This is a book that will stick with me for awhile.
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|Forget this. It wasn't at all what. I was expecting. Thank you but no thank you. Just not for me.
B00006674X|5.0|Fast shipping, I bought it brand new and the movie case was sealed in factory plastic. i bought it for my mother as a gift since i cant find this movie anywhere in stores.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is always excellent.....  Every episode and every series is great.  I have watched the episodes many times over.  Love it
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I loved this game. At first I thought it was a little childish but later had a change of heart. It made me happy. Thank you forthe fun.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|ojmgmdujaBwsbdiowdw i couldnt believe its too beautiful it is soo great and she is thebomb.com ok its so great ok

B0090P98Z4|5.0|This right here this right here this right here is a beast mode game it's really nice and has awesome graphics
B003B02O7I|5.0|The book was great, though I did not expect the ending. I was hoping for a little more details at the end,which you will understand once you read it, but it was a very enjoyable story.
B009C7ZQM4|2.0|This wad just not what I had expected. Its poky but it's. Just not my. Upof tea. Thank you but no thank you.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|DH4 is an amazing game in my opinion , great graphics and a vary good story line. 5 stars, outstanding.<br /><br />thanks Camelot!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I thought that if I purchased this one then I wouldn't get the advertisements that the free version has. Well I was right to a certain extent. I don't get the annoying ads that are on the bottom. Instead, I get pop ups every time I open the app. Decided I wanted to set an alarm for work, didn't go off. When I looked at it, it said that it wasn't responding and asked if I would like to close or wait. I clicked wait and another ad popped up. The damn alarm didn't go off because of an ad. I PAID for this! Why am I getting ads still?! DO NOT BUY!!!
B0064QNS62|2.0|Nope. Not for me. I thought it was something else. Thank you but no thankyou. It's. Just not my cup of tea.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game it keep`s my daughter's mind racing. Have really wants to start her own garden. I told her once . The weather changes her wish is my command.
0375758992|5.0|The author captures life in Africa during a turbulent period like no other author I've read. As someone who grew up in Africa, I can smell the dry grass, the wood smoke fires, feel the fright over snakes, and relate to the fear and uncertainty over political upheaval.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed palying this game. It holds your interest and keep you on your toes.  Very interesting. Thank you for the fun.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Describes some real issues covered up by society. The peer pressure to steal the car by gang members. A real learning experience for the Vietnamese family and the old man (Clint Eastwood) who bonded during the movie. The gang violence from an intercity point of view including a drive by shooting and the rape of the teen living next door. Overall its an awesome movie with lots of drama.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I didn't like this at all. Its not what I wanted. Thank you but no thanks. It's. Just not for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and once u play it u can't stop and its FREE all you have to do is enter your age birthday month and year .
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|No definately not for me. At first it sou dee good. I found that it just wasn't for me. Thank you anyway.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game, runs smoothly, have had no problems. I play it on my Kindle Fire HD, my Samsung 3, and my laptop. Also, it has become a family and friends game, either when we are all together or apart.
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|This is a challenge. I enjoy this very much. Its simple yet keeps you on your toes. Thank you very much.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Best book of the series by far still some interesting parts to come but looking forward to HBO series now surely an Emmy in the making.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I feel like Suzanne Collins might have burnt herself out on this last novel.  It was slow in some areas, l loved the ending.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a very fun game.  The only problem I see is the time it take for you to get lives.  Play with all my friends and family.  We all love this game and the challenging levels
B00EVPSJOE|4.0|Classic unplugged album. If your an Eric Clapton fan at all then you know how great this performance was and a absolute must to own! This is a newly remastered set that included the DVD with the CD. Unfortunately for some reason the concert was just a DVD and not Blu Ray High Def Disc. Not sure why they would release on DVD at this point when everyones got High Def tvs and blu ray players. There are some additional tracks pulled from rehearsals of songs that did not appear in the concert like a &#34;My Fathers Eyes&#34; and &#34;Circus&#34; or alternate takes of some songs. This would have been in my opinion the definitive version to own if they had converted the concert to blu ray high def and maybe include some retrospective features as well.
B00DOPEGAS|2.0|Very hard to loop wrap rubber bands together, daughter ended up doing them by hand. The rubber band plate thing doesn't make it any easier to make braclets.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|This was an okay read, not a page turner by any means. It makes one appreciate what prison life was like at Danbury but it was similar to reading a diary and while it gives some insight of daily life in prison, it was hard to continue to continue to read but I wanted to finish it.
B005PK553C|4.0|What an engaging thriller!  Not for the weak, very suspenseful.  Casting was exceptional.  Came back to season one after becoming engrossed in season three.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I typically do not enjoy Woody Allen movies and I often find Owen Wilson to be too much for my tastes.  But I absolutely love and adore this movie, so much so that if I am channel hoping and this movie is on, I will sit down and watch it ... chores be damned.<br /><br />It's a sweet and smart movie.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|the central idea of the book, the small man pitted again the big, the presumably weak against the presumably strong, in adverse circumstances and expected to definitely lose is so gripping. the stories are. even the arguments gell. but the roller coaster style of writing of mr gladwell, left me dissatisfied. wish he had written it more systematically presenting only one story at a time instead of jumping from one to the other quite often. but each story, sorry fact, by itself, is gripping and heart wrenching.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Love this show it's so great. My best friend got me hooked on this show and I know I will be getting season 3 when it comes out
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is fun, but time consuming. I like this game. I like Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. Game is fun
0525478817|4.0|What a great book for teenagers and adults. Two great, real characters. I was told that it was depressing, but don't let that turn you away. It's funny, smart, honest and inspirational.
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|I don't understand all the complaints about too much dialogue.  Did these people not see the first two movies???<br />Before Midnight is the perfect followup to Before Sunrise and Before Sunset. I think going in any other direction would have been untrue to these characters, with whom I have grown up & grown older, and their story. Is it too much realism? Not for me. Some of the scenes actually pained me and felt uncomfortable yet at the same time I had to marvel at how real it was. I absolutely believed that Celine and Jesse's relationship could reach this crossroads. At the same time, I had to admit that this is what a middle-aged couple with kids would act and fight, even with such a romantic beginning as they did. Not every couple has a storied origin as Celine and Jesse - first meeting on a train and spending one night in Vienna together then meeting nine years later in Paris for one afternoon - but this movie reminds us that fairy tales don't last forever. Every couple has to fight to keep the flame going every day, through banalities and difficulties.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|As always, Baldacci has written a fast paced book. It was an interesting and fun read. The characters seemed real and No.g and Maxwell are interesting partners.
B004G600A4|5.0|I just watched this with my daughter and she loved it! I did too. What a wonderful, heartwarming movie for all ages. The ending was fantastic.I admit that I cried during the scene with the sad King and Queen releasing the lanterns. And then again towards the end. So touching.

B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Absolutely hilarious. Like cry laughing hilarious. More cursing than I expected though. I wouldn't recommend watching with the parents though.
B00FITRTQ6|4.0|I am not a usual reader of mysteries, but I took advantage of an offer for a free book. More than that, I really enjoyed Cutting Right to the Chase, the previous book by Stefania Mattana. Mattana is an Italian born and raised writer living in Britain. Her character, Chase, is a British, born and raised former detective of Scotland Yard, now living in Italy. That little twist helps in the writing. I am not sure how she does it but you can almost hear the Italian accent in the Italian characters. Chase, the lone Brit, is very British. There is no mistaking that in his language. In many books it is relatively easy to forget the British characters nationality, not here, Chase probably sticks out quite a bit in the medieval city of Tursenia where he lives.<br /><br />Chase is a former detective. The reason as why he is a former detective is a bit of a mystery. He hasn't even told his friend Inspector Angelo Alunni, who uses Chase as a consultant, the reason. All that Chase lets on to is his discharge, not dismissal, was because he was responsible for a big mess. Chase is now called in to help Alunni in solving the murder of Piero Galli, a wealthy resident of Tursenia. The scene looks like an accident. A chandelier fell on Galli killing him. Chase sees more, and the investigation begins.<br /><br />In the previous book I compared Chase to a grown up Encyclopedia Brown. In this novel there is still some of that and maybe a bit of Columbo too. Chase is a likable character and very much a realistic one too. He is a genuine nice guy and usually only gets agitated by cigarette smoke and when his running is disturbed.<br /><br />Mattana writes a good old time mystery. It is not a CSI type book or a detective who crosses the line the get his man. Into the Killer Sphere is a mystery, safe (and clean) enough for all ages and yet engaging enough for adults looking for some light reading. As I said earlier, I usually don't read mysteries but, Mattana's books are a very welcome break from my usual assortment on non-fiction reading.from my usual assortment on non-fiction reading.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Awesome show. Kevin Spacey makes it awesome. I also liked that I could download these using the Amazon Prime app for the iPad and them watch them offline while on the plane. Beats Netflix if you have to travel.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|After watching their little drummer boy video on aol, I had to have it. This album is well worth the price. The songs are all beautiful. Highly recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Game was fun until Caesars took over. Not so much anymore. Any negative feedback and you're blocked from leaving input on.their fan page.
B0031SCV46|5.0|Solid built, works very well.  One note with the Mavericks update, even though it's device compliant (they essentially mean that it'll work without the Directlink software) you will need the Directlink driver, if you have a hard time finding it or getting it to install I recommend going to M-Audio's website and asking them on the forum (the employees respond and they are very helpful!!).<br />Once you get that driver installed, you will now be able to use the transport buttons (play, record, rewind, and stop (which also functions as the beginning of track button for the latest version of Garageband by pressing twice).<br />It's a real joy, I have a full workstation synth and while it's a good one and is a collectors item, (most synths are or will be), I prefer to use this and garageband.  I also recommend Computer Music mag which has a ton of free or demo instruments.<br />I have the Ikea desk which has an undertable slide out keyboard/mouse tray, so I put this synth on top and push my monitor back, the setup works well.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you like Despicable Me, you will love Minion Rush! There are different locations to play, but you have to earn them. There are many different costumes that you can buy with Bananas or Gru Tokens. There are power ups that you have to activate by spending some bananas. I hope you like this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun puzzles to pass the time and make you think. A good mix of easy teasers and tricky tests. I highly recommend this for an entertaining diversion!
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love this game and play it often.  Especially during the sleepless nights when every thing else is shut down
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Such a nice movie!  Beautiful scenery and good story line.  Will watch it again with a nice glass of wine!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Gold finch<br /><br />this is one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time.  By starting in the present and going back to the past incourages you to jump right in.  Couldn't put the book down. Fast moving and holds your interest
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Game needs better instructions.  Playing by ear makes it harder to know what to do. I don't like that my review has to be so long.

B0089LOG02|5.0|Easy to read and keeps you on the edge of your seat til the very end. Read this for book club this month and found it delightful! It is sure to please both avid readers and occasional readers. It is wonderful and touching!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really enjoyed the final book to the Divergent Series. I just finished reading it today and I was totally shocked with the ending. In my opinion, it gave the story a more real life experience. Life is not always about happy endings. By killing off one of the main character's, I believe it sets the author apart from so many others. Of course, I wanted Tris and Tobias to have there happy ever after but lets be honest, this book wouldn't have been so great without going the route that the author decided to go.<br /><br />This is a book/series that I will read again and again!!! I just hope that more people will leave a genuine review based off the story and how well it was put together instead of there disappointment that the author didn't give into the fairy tale ending...
B00GH4R95C|3.0|I just couldn't get into this movie.  It was well done and there were some parts that I really liked.  The battle seemed to go on a little to long but overall this movie was good I just couldn't get into it that much
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Luv . This game got my nephew hooked n my brother. Great game for free! Keeps u on it toes and too cute.

B007P2DQJI|5.0|I've been burned several times buying batteries on Amazon.  (The ones I got for my XBox controllers were absolute crap, and dead on arrival, which made me not trust Amazon for batteries.)<br /><br />I bought this one, expecting it was $10 I was burning.  The battery is great, and has worked better than the one it replaced (it lasts a few hours longer; nice!)  Have had this battery (the new one) for three months, still going strong.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|It says it in the title but, it is good because it addicting, it has good graphics and it is a challenge at times but it is very fun once you beat whoever you had trouble with.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|If they had just kept in the deleted scenes this movie would have been MUCH better. So, when you've finished the movie and are scratching your head, go back and watch the extras and everything will click into place. Oh, and I should say that I've never seen any of the Alien movies except for Alien vs. Predator, so take my review with a grain of salt (I'm one of THOSE people).
B004SUDQE0|4.0|We really enjoyed this goofy little film and it's entirely British humor. The cast is well selected and well directed.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Not like the book, but still beautiful and well done in its own right. The acting is excellent, meaning that all of the characters were portrayed exactly as I imagined them while reading the books. The only exception is Riley (who is supposed to be blonde) but oddly enough, even when I read the words in the book about her being blonde I always picture her with dark hair, so it all works out. I especially love the actor who plays Ethan. If I was ten years younger, I'd be all about that! (haha)
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've ever played. You should definitely try it. It will blow your mind
B00BSBY38A|2.0|I guess my husband and I are just weird. Everyone says they love this movie, but we both found it extremely boring (and we have very different tastes in movies). Based on our friends who recommended this movie to us, my guess is that people who are deeply religious or have a lot of faith are able to appreciate this movie more than...skeptics like me. It has many faith, hope, and &#34;being tested&#34; themes running throughout. So, if that's your thing, watch it!
B0062P3392|4.0|Surprisingly Good.  Very violent.  Normally I don't go for movies with over-the-top hand-to-hand combat and chase scenes, either on foot or in cars, but this one held my interest.  Of course, some scenes are totally unrealistic (amazing how un-trained all the &#34;bad guys&#34; were), and Statham/Owen must be super-heroes because the punches seemed to bounce right off them and they in turn bounced right up from horrendous falls ... but these are sacrifices you make in the name of entertainment, right?  I rented it because of Clive Owen, but found Statham the more compelling character.  The ending was a nice touch but it strained belief - there was no good reason for the character who was being pursued to be in that location.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I returned the white version because it had connectivity issues. This has worked flawlessly. It appears to be using the same driver and has the same chipset.
B009NH6JRE|4.0|it is getting bigger and better and goriest! Great show! Highly recommendation to zombie fans. You wont be disappointed! (=
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This novel should be read by everyone who wants to understand how IT is integrated into all of business. I gave this book a 5 star rating because the situation in the story is so real to what I've seen in IT. The book is a fairly easy read.
B008JFUORW|5.0|Ordered this as an upcoming Christmas gift for my dad. We already own the first two. I just wanted to get this one to complete it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|If you love puzzles, you will love The Room!  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 rating is because although I was thrilled to have solve it, I wanted more.  But wait, there is the epilogue!  Great graphics on my Kindle 7 HD!  I hope the makers give us more.  Worth the money to me.
B001N4RORE|4.0|After seeing this on Broadway, it was still fun to see this movie.  The plot is fun, the music is outstanding.  It is a fun film.  Enjoyed seeing Merryl Streep, Colin Firth, and Pierce Brosnan in atypical rolls for them.  The scenery in Greece is beautiful.  It's a buoyant, upbeat film in which every one appears to be having a good time.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiant is definitely stirring up feelings and strong reactions among Divergent series fans. I tried to avoid reading reviews until I read the book but even just scrolling through my social media feeds, I could see something severe was going to happen.  I had an idea of what it might be, and while I was on the right track, I didn’t quite guess it.  This is going to be a spoiler-free review.<br /><br />I really liked the explanations in the beginning of Allegiant after the group went outside Chicago’s city limits. The truth about the factions in Chicago and the existence of the Divergent made so much sense to me. That part got scientific and I enjoyed that. I liked that this was a smart book. I always wondered why the scenario with the factions was going on only inside Chicago. While reading the first book I wondered whether the rest of the country still existed in this world, or if it was all a wasteland with Chicago being the last with a civilization. So I found the additional world building in Allegiant to be very satisfying.<br /><br />However, the remainder of the book, leading up to the epic ending, was very political and a bit dull with all the strategy and discussions. I get that it was necessary, but it dragged for me. I also had a lot of anxiety since I knew something awful was going to happen, but I didn’t know what or when. I had even more anxiety when I realized what was going to happen, and that it was going to happen soon.<br /><br />The relationship between Tris and Tobias went through some tests in this book but the two of them are so strong together that I believed that they could work through anything.  I did like how Tobias was less than perfect in this book. In the past he always seemed to be the best at everything, to me at least, so I liked to see him being more vulnerable. Though, the ending was more than anyone should have to endure.<br /><br />So, that ending. On one hand it makes perfect sense. I wouldn’t have expected anything less from this character (no spoilers here). But on the other hand… OMG!! Yes, it was an epic way to end the trilogy, but was it truly necessary? The end goal would have been accomplished with or without that something awful, even if the author says it was in the plan all along (you can read about it on her blog, but DO NOT read it if you haven’t read the book yet unless you want the ending spoiled). I do agree that this character’ journey throughout this series was leading up to this decision, and this choice really did define this character. BUT, making that choice was the defining moment in this character’s development. The actual outcome could have been different and wouldn’t have changed the strength of that choice. Yes, that epic ending was powerful and so so painful. And yes, that makes this ending so dramatic. But I don’t agree that it was absolutely necessary. I’m just going to leave it at that.ss from this character (no spoilers here). But on the other hand… OMG!! Yes, it was an epic way to end the trilogy, but was it truly necessary?

B00BD99JMW|5.0|A wonderful end to this fantastic series!!  It has some twists and turns that are very sad, but it does a great job of wrapping up loose ends in a satisfying way.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Loved the character development of the various characters.  The author did an excellent job of presenting the cultural differences in two worlds, along with the stark contrast between the upper and lower classes in India.
B000W94FE6|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book based on the description and reviews but was completely disappointed. There is nothing &#34;Optimal&#34; about this book and the words &#34;clear&#34; or &#34;concise&#34; do not apply to this writing style. I've never read a more verbose book. The book goes on and on about nothing or maybe you could say, the same thing, ad nauseum. For a book about &#34;Optimal Experience&#34; and a &#34;genuinely satisfying state of consciousness&#34;, it really misses the mark. Perhaps it would be better in an audio format so you could listen while you meditate or fall asleep. Either way, as a book, it was a huge disappointment.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Great item for all those who want to dress up as the 10th Doctor!  It's affordable, it's light, the battery is easy to assemble and its easy to operate.  It sounds like the sonic screwdriver from the series and the audio level sounds right.  My one minor negative involves the pen tip on the other end.  It falls out quite easily, so I keep it off at all times when using this as a prop.  But they do give you a second pen tip for when the other one runs out of ink... which keeps the item at 5 stars for me.  Allonsy!
B0089LOG02|5.0|What an amazing book about survival! I couldn't stop reading this and finished it much to fast. So heart felt  and inspiring. I'm at a lost for words. Just magical!
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|Paired with my new Samsung F8000 this 3D experience is far superior to what we got in the actual theaters.  It's a great film and the 3D works well here.  Beautiful picture and sound!
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|There are none.granted I am no youngster,but I sat tapping and dragging pieces of puzzle nothing happened.so if someone could please post how to play,I would love to try again.
0451169514|4.0|1st off I tend to be very critical when it comes to handing out a perfect rating.  I think many give out a 5 star b/c they &#34;like&#34; the story.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this book.  I never thought I would ever read an 1100+ page novel.  The length was intimidating for sure when I started.  I want to rate this as a 5 star, however there are some serious flaws that prevent me in good conscious from giving it a perfect rating.<br /><br />Now most people by now know the premise.  The town of Derry, Maine is being haunted by &#34;IT&#34;, otherwise known as Pennywise the dancing clown, and every 27 years or so IT awakes to feed on the children of Derry.  7 kids are brought together by forces outside themselves and vow to kill It in the summer of '58.  However after making a pact, they return in 1985 after IT returns.<br /><br />I really liked how King began this book. If you're going to write an 1100 page book, you have to get the reader hooked right away and he does this in the 1st 50 pages or so.<br /><br />After this there is a lot of backstory talking about how all of the characters got to where they were in 1985, how they became friends in 1958, and how they came to discover IT back then.  It really isn't until almost 700 pages in that the &#34;Losers Club&#34; is completely united w/ it's 7 members finally joining together.  At this point the story really takes off.  That isn't to say the story is boring before that.  I use the analogy of an ocean wave to describe King's writing style.  Slow backstory builds into a crescendo or a climax and then it falls back to a slower pace.  With 7 characters in this book there is a lot of that going on throughout the story.  For a long time this can be a little frustrating as I'd continually want the story to get going.  In the end it is worth it, but for myself, it takes away from being a perfect rating.<br /><br />Also how could I forget the ridiculous confrontation with IT in the waning pages of the novel.Once the Losers Club unite and begin planning to fight IT (pages 700-1000 or so) this is a real page turner.  I enjoyed this part of the book more than almost anything I have ever read.  However, once they enter the lair of IT, this book really becomes a mess for me.  With a better ending this book would unquestionably be my favorite of all time.  That being said, this is still a great read, but definitely something that leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth when i look back.<br /><br />That being said there is plenty to like about this book.  The characters are really well developed and you feel like you're a part of their club.  While I was never &#34;afraid&#34; while reading this book like I was at times during 'The Shining', there are some pretty &#34;intense&#34; scenes, the scenes involving the house on Neibolt Street or the Derry water tower particularly come to mind.  Finally, don't be intimidated by the size of this book.  Yes, its quite a commitment of time to finish a book of IT's length  But I found that the pages turned pretty quickly and I was able to finish it in a little over a month.  This is 1 of King's most famous works and rightfully so, a solid 4 star novel with a few flaws that in the end keep it from being a home run classic.  But still a solid triple to use a baseball analogy that King would appreciate that will keep the reader turning the pages throughout wondering what is going to happen to our loveable 'Losers' next.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|These is not my type of viewing genre at all.  However, someone said that they liked it so I though why not.  The first few episodes I thought, 'Why and I sitting here watching this'?  Well after I got through those episodes I became hooked once I knew the characters and storyline.  Just think about having to live without anything - then think about having to do this battling these zombies every step of the way - no thanks - but it is a gripping.  Later episodes are not so gruesome.  Overall I like it.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Almost as good as it's predecessor Monster's Inc. I think the adults enjoyed it more than the kids.  Worth the rental!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It is a good game but they don't let you earn enough coins for hints. Also it freezes up sometimes
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row hooks you in chapter one and keeps you reading to the very end.  Loved this book!  Kudos to JG
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have been hesitant to read any of later Grisham's stuff because it all started being pretty repetitive.  I loved A Time To Kill, so the fact he was bringing back characters from that book got me intrigued!  I'm so glad I took a chance on this one.  Great story and well written. In fact, I am now re-reading A Time To Kill and will probably reread this one after to see what I missed the first time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is amazing. I really recommend this game. I have only played this game a short amount of time and I'm addicted to it..
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This is a colorful Disney way that covers the primitive years of cave men! It is child appropriate, but adults will enjoy it just as much!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|What's not to like.  It gets the job done in half the time of the original charge cable.  I wish I had extra ones to keep at work, in the car (do they make car adaptors for this?), etc.  Thanks Amazon!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Walking Dead! The zombie scenes never get old.  There is always a twist turn and suspense's. However, damn when are these people ever going to have civility & peace. I guess we have to just tune in to see.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|When Khalid writes about the beauty of Afghanistan he does it so well I can see it with my eyes, I fight  no to see the pain sorrow that people endure. It kills me to think how children suffer so much in will be a day of  reckoning.
B0063GORYU|1.0|did not work on my kindle fire HD it was very slow and did not move very good i would have loved to play the game
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Liked the game but needs to be more lives.  It really passes the time when there you are waiting.  Keeps you guessing.
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|This is a good CD, the best they've done in years past, with three songs that stand out, but it's not Deep Purple without Blackmore. Every song lacks the depth and melodic touch of Blackmore's writing and playing. Missing also is rhe solid playing of Jon Lord,his mastery of the B 3 was  phenominal! No need for spacy keyboard playing that doesn't fit. Steve Morse's playing is solid and does stand out on two tracks, but once again it's not Blackmore. will always be his band and no matter what!  Without him will never be the same!
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I do wish you could get more prizes when you banish a criminal. Everything seems a little pricey especially when trying to complete a task. But overall a great game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fantastic device. Incredibly easy to install. Only $35. Great for TVs or Bluerays without wireless access. Best gadget of the year!
B00EO4SBSG|4.0|I am a long time Trivium fan and this album is a great addition to their catalog.The first thing I noticed was how good this record sounds and the strength of the songs. This album has a whole lot more of what I guess is called &#34;clean&#34; vocals than some of their previous albums.Great guitar playing,as usual.STRONG.
B00FG9BJS2|4.0|With great skill Mr. Bellow captures the existential anguish of a day. I rated it 4 stars only because it is very short.
B00EDOS6IC|3.0|This the first Alter Bridge album I have ever bought.I thought I would take a chance on it because of all the 5 star reviews it was getting.Also because I really enjoyed the Tremonti album.To me a lot of this album sounds the same and Myles Kennedy's vocals pretty much sound the same throughout.I prefer the couple songs where somebody else take over vocals.Kennedy's vocals just don't do it for me.Lyrics pretty much interchangeable.The Tremonti album is much better than this.

B005TVYVI2|5.0|This is the greatest training device for finding your most efficient stroke and rhythm. I have always been a better 200 breaststroker in the past but recently I have been training at a lower tempo than usual and have found the sweet spot of a quick tempo but still getting glide from my powerful kick. After a few months of training with it I swam my first scy 100 breast since last season and went half a second faster in season than I did last year at my full taper meet with a suit and shave. Also got my Winter nats cut which was a surprise to get during training. Even if it is a simple device it is worth every Pennie.

B00GS1EOJS|5.0|I borrowed the Japanese version from a friend last week and I absolutely fell in love with this film, so much that I had to pre-order this release from FUNimation for Feb 18, 2014. If you have seen Evangelion 2.22, it is worth noting that everything that appears in the &#34;PREVIEW&#34; of Evangelion 2.22 during the end *has none of those scenes reappearing in 3.33.*<br /><br />Instead of the film taking off right after the events of 2.22 (when Shinji Ikari and Rei Ayanami are supposedly still in Unit 01 after getting plunged by the spear (which is shown in the preview of 3.33 at the end of 2.22), it is set 14 years into the future. Shinji is no longer the Shinji that shows backbone and strength from 1.11 and 2.22 (though if you see the movie, you'll understand why). Everyone's attitude toward him is different. Lots of questions the viewers have about a lot of scenes are left unanswered throughout the film.<br /><br />(SPOILERS) Quick Summary:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />This movie focuses on how the Third Impact has affected Shinji and everyone else both physically and emotionally over the course of 14 years. Shinji is responsible for the mass extinction of the entire planet, which is the plot. During the first half of the movie, he tries to discover why everyone's attitude is completely changed, until he is told that he is responsible for the Third Impact. Once he is told of everything that occurred when he tried to save Rei (which he failed to do as well) he goes into a state of depression. Kaworu (the person who was seen sitting on the EVA in space in 2.22), who becomes Shinji's only friend, convinces him that the two of them can fix everything that Shinji caused, which inevitably results with Shinji repeating the events of the Third Impact.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Animations done in the movie are much better than the previous titles. The music implemented in this film aren't as good as the previous titles, but still good, just more intense than before.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this movie. I understand why people disliked this film. There was just so much change that altered the story so heavily. What I believe Hideaki Anno (writer and director) tried to do was to show how the Third Impact would affect everyone over time instead of instantaneously, which was why I loved it. However, this film will either be much stronger or much weaker, depending on how the 4th and final installment of the rebuild series turns out.

It kept me interested most of the time, although some parts were too detailed for my taste.<br />An exposure to Chinese customs in the mother land, much different from our own.

I am grateful to have been blessed with my American<br />heritage and pleased that Chinese women are treated as equals who grew to womanhood here.

1781162646|5.0|I've read Stephen King since 1976. Two elements that can reliably be found in much of his work are the heroic, wise-beyond-his/her-years kid, and a palpable sense of nostalgia (either the author's or the protagonist's or both). These elements are like old friends when I pick up a new work by King, though I don't pick up everything as soon as it appears. But this time the Fates made sure I would take a second look at Joyland: it was short, I was sent a review copy right between project deadlines, and its publisher is one of my favorites (Hard Case Crime by way of Titan Books). In case you wonder, yes, I own all Hard Case Crime titles (I haven't read them all, but I'm trying). I love the old-fashioned pulp covers, and they never disappoint with either the reissues or the originals… and here was an original Stephen King novel with a typically awesome (if slightly overwrought) cover. Oh, and it's set in the 70s, the decade I went from 5th grade to halfway through college. It was a natural selection, and… well, I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Now that I have that out of the way, a quick description and a couple nitpicks. It's 1973 and Devin Jones (a name that didn't quite ring true for me, by the way) is nursing a broken heart because the love of his life has dumped him. He decides to spend a summer recovering by hiding in a second-rate North Carolina theme park about as far as you can get from Disneyland, but along the same general lines. A doggy mascot based on a cartoon, fading glitter, a degenerating midway, slowing business. Reminded me of a small park my grade school took us to for year's end, a place called Muskego Beach (and later the much more 70s Dandelion Park), which also had a Wild Mouse and a wooden roller coaster, plus rides such as the Tilt-A-Whirl and Crack-the-Whip. I remember the Wild Mouse broke down one year and some kids got hurt – it always did look rickety to me, and I wonder now how rigorous were the safety standards then, eh? Ah, but I digress. Anyway, I knew just the look of Joyland the park: it was Muskego Beach with a hint of the later Great America thrown in, plus the costume dog, Howie the Happy Hound. The dog's important because Devin &#34;wears the fur&#34; so well that he becomes the park's star attraction of sorts – he hides under the heatstroke-inducing mascot costume because the kids love it, and they love him because he's the best Howie of all the summer help. It allows him to lose himself in a cartoon character rather than dwell on the broken heart Wendy Keegan left in his care. (See how easy it is to go into reminiscence mode when describing the book?)<br /><br />But the park has a history. A girl was murdered there a few years before, and in a roundabout way Devin ends up investigating and realizing that she was the last of five victims of possibly the same killer. His friends and co-workers Tom and Erin (the kind of couple Devin would like to be part of) become involved when it appears Tom can see the dead girl's ghost and Erin catches the investigation bug from Devin. But Tom doesn't want to see the ghost, and Devin wishes he could. It's another symbolic disappointment, and Devin tries to make up for it by going all Hardy Boy on the old crime.<br /><br />In the meantime, he has met seriously ill young Mike Ross, his dog Milo, and Annie his beautiful but overly protective mother. This sets the stage for the slow wind-up to the confrontation you sense is coming, when Devin confronts pretty much all the crises of his life – and in so doing grows up. He falls for Mike, partly because he's truly special, and also Mike's mom, and he comes to terms with his ended romance and a few other things. You can chart Devin's  growth through the gentle nostalgia you hear in the adult narrator's tone, a King trademark that also makes the story an affecting read for anyone whose looked back wistfully at his or her youth. So the crime story really takes a back seat to the coming of age story, but the two are so intertwined as to be the same. The mystery is solved, but it doesn't feel as though it's the point of the novel, and in this bait and switch King pulls off the coup, grabbing you with the lurid crime but then making you suffer Devin's heartache with surprising ease.<br /><br />It's not perfect. There are a couple very minor botched references (one to a Bond movie that bugged me) and an occasional anachronism, and the climax overly depends on something in Mike's mom's past that's a bit convenient when you think about it too much, but what the book has in spades is heart. And that's just what you want in a novel. King still knows how to manipulate a response from readers, even those jaded by some of his longer work. Joyland packs a punch precisely because – besides the familiar and effective King narrative voice – he was able to control its length and scope even though he could have let it run. I think this novel might well have gathered a whole raft of new readers, while recapturing some who had fallen away. I know it worked with me.<br /><br />Review by W.D.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|It is true. This is one of those books you simply can't put down. It builds into a crescendo of unexpected events, bam, bam, bam, one right after the other. Interspersed with those things you know deep down inside are coming. You just have to read another page or so further to confirm the growing understanding. All while feeling a sense of dread, of doom and of sorrow for this all American family.<br />Pick it up - and just try to put it back down, to put it out of your mind.<br />It was an easy read as much for the suspense and drama of it all, as for the economy of words in the descriptions employed by the author. He wasted no time on the frivolous in order to get his point across, and the story told. That isn't to say he (the author) was stingy with his &#34;theatrical devices&#34; as it were. He was simply brilliant at paring down the structure enough to prevent boredom, but still maintaining a mastery of the devices from which a dazzling storyteller draws to sell you on this set of brilliant players in a shocking murder mystery.

B00BHJ0MY2|5.0|When you hear that there is a new album of West African music, certain presumptions undoubtedly enter your mind.  Whether you conjure up echoes of time-honored folkloric styles from the region or imagine more contemporary motifs, put aside your preconceptions before you listen to this album.  It’s different, and it’s beautiful.  While almost reverential in relation to the traditions of her home country of Mali, Traoré also expresses a cheeky rock sensibility that takes her music beyond the limitations inherent in those traditions.  Indeed, the variety of musical styles represented on this record make it impossible to encapsulate Traoré’s “voice” (in both the singing and songwriting senses of that word).<br /><br />Some songs, like &#34;Mélancolie,&#34; the one I personally enjoy the most, are contemplative (“O melancholy, faithful companion of my solitude, dance with me to the beautiful cadence of my joyful dreams”).  Others, like &#34;Kouma,&#34; which means “Speech,” are almost explosive in their intensity.  &#34;Kouma&#34; itself wails against temptation and perfidy (“I’ll lure you with fine words . . . Ill-used, it can wound like a wild beast”), while &#34;Sikey&#34; (“Talk Openly”), is about defying expectations (“For as long as she insists on singing in public, what honor is left to the noble one . . .  I’m an artist, your opinion means little”).  &#34;Tuit Tuit&#34; interposes a bird’s song and Traoré’s African nickname, Kia, to make sweet joyful music, while the title song is prideful and angry.<br /><br />This album establishes Traoré as an extraordinary singer and songwriter, remarkable for both the range of her singing voice, which is powerful and emotional, and for the breadth of her songwriting voice.

B000JMKQX0|1.0|I knew the book was a collection of war stories about the outbreak, but i expected them to be somewhat fulfilling. They were not. Each one is incredibly short and boring. The first one is probably the best one and it stops out of no where. You don't care about any of the characters because you have no time to get to know any of them. Each story is similar. Like, this is how i saw the first infected person, this is how i think it started, here are a few minor details i saw.... the end. Then the next unrelated story starts. Yawn. I stopped around page 200. I was expecting different stories of survival from the start of the war until the end and how each person, or group, managed to get through it all alive. Instead, each story only covers a day or two. Even if it was completely real and not fiction, it would still be boring. This is one of the rare cases where the movie is a million times better than the book.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|This movie is action packed but less one star because of the ending, very sad ending and cannot return from there!
B00G3HSF7O|3.0|Director Neill Blomkamp made gained international fame with the underground hit District 9, which combined special effects and strong acting with a nuanced social commentary about interracial relations in Blomkamp's native South Africa. Elysium continues many of the same themes but also suggests that Blomkamp might be adopting the worst tendencies of Hollywood.<br /><br />As a standalone science fiction movie, Elysium is pretty decent. It's a fast sci-fi thriller about a man (Matt Damon) who seeks a better life on an orbiting station called Elysium. Earth has fallen into dire straights while the wealthy seek refuge in Elysium. There are some pretty bold plot twists and the movie manages to be an entertaining ride. However, the movie promised to be more than just another sci-fi action movie. Unfortunately, it proves to be less compelling as social commentary.<br /><br />The movie nearly hits you over the head with the immigration theme. This movie is about immigration and Neill Blomkamp wants you to know it. Blomkamp even went so far as to cast Hispanics for most of the characters stuck on Earth (with the notable exception of Matt Damon). The residents of Elysium are all white and have American accents. As an analogy for U.S. immigration politics, this is about as subtle as a Rush Limbaugh.<br /><br />However, effective social commentary needs more than just an analogy. The story should help viewers understand the issue better or from a new perspective. Again, the lack of subtlety undermines the commentary. The managers of Elysium are portrayed as villains of the worst sort. Jodie Foster is an unsympathetic dictator and Sharlto Copley is a sadistic bounty hunter who likes killing immigrants. The residents of Elysium are portrayed merely as wealthy and out-of-touch. The immigrants we see simply want access to better medical care for them or their adorable children. As such, the movie seems to insist that keeping illegal immigrants out is morally inexcusable.<br /><br/>Yet, for all of its analogies to real-world immigration politics, the movie's depiction of immigration says nothing about real-world immigration politics. The movie never explores the real driver behind immigration politics, namely competition between low-wage American workers and immigrant workers. If anything, the wealthy in America and corporations are more likely to favor immigration as a source of cheap labor. There are also important questions about the capacity of government institutions and resources to handle a large influx of immigrants.<br /><br />Elysium chooses simplistic answers rather than exploring these tensions. The movie's finale borders on ridiculous. *SPOILER* The Earth residents manage to make all humans citizens of Elysium and thereby grant them all access to Elysium's healthcare system. However, in practice this would probably quickly overburden the health system, leading to a deterioration in quality or a complete collapse. *SPOILER*<br /><br />The contrast to District 9 is illuminating. In that movie, there were no black and white heroes and villains. The government's policies were portrayed as wrong, but not evil. Sharlto Copley's character in District 9, Wikus, the government inspector, started off as a hapless bureaucrat, not a sadistic monster (a sharp contrast to Copley's character in Elysium). More importantly, District 9 shows Wikus gradually learning about the aliens and gaining respect for them. The movie invited viewers to take the same journey as Wikus and showed us why the government policies were wrong. By contrast, I felt that too often Elysium simply tried to force its arguments on viewers.<br /><br />I've probably been too harsh on Elysium but only because Neill Blomkamp raised the bar so high. Again, as an action/adventure sci-fi movie it holds up pretty well. I focused on the social commentary aspects of the film because it permeates so much of Elysium. My review is not intended to argue a particular side of the immigration debate, but rather to show just how unsatisfactory Elysium is as social commentary. One gets the sense that Blomkamp dumbed down the social commentary and adopted more traditional Hollywood approaches to moviemaking, including increasing the action, hiring famous actors, and dumbing down the social commentary. It's worth watching, but with lowered expectations.<br /><br />Overall: 3.5 stars.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Simple logic puzzles determining the best path to take when connecting the dots. You'll be at level 20 in moments. It's a fun distraction.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Pacific Rim is Guillermo del Toro's take on Japanese monster movies. It's as simple as that. If you like the idea of giant robots fighting giant monsters, you'll like this movie. If you're looking for a movie with an intelligent plot, compelling characters, and witty dialogue, this isn't it.<br /><br />Del Toro obviously has an excellent eye for cinematography and as a result Pacific Rim is a stunningly beautiful film. It's a delight to watch. Del Toro and his special effects department manage to make it look absolutely real, even the giant monsters. That's no small accomplishment, especially in an age where audiences are becoming inured to computer-generated effects.<br /><br />The rest of the movie doesn't support those lofty visual effects. Most of the characters are one-dimensional at best. The two main characters, Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori, just aren't interesting enough to care about. They're generic, inoffensive heroes. The two scientists are even worse and are actually grating. It seems del Toro found two ridiculous caricatures of scientists and told the actors to take it even further. Despite the danger all of the characters faced, I found myself not really caring about any of them.<br /><br />However, the plot really dragged the movie down. There are just so many plot wholes and gaps in logic as to make it difficult to suspend disbelief. First, it's never really clear why the humans can't just use nukes against the monsters, but apparently laser cannons and giant swords are effective against them. Second, if the monsters are all clones of each other, why are they all different shapes and sizes? Third, it's not really clear why two operators are needed for each robot if they each perform the same functions. If it's just about brain capacity, couldn't you automate some functions? And so on...<br /><br />If you like the idea of robots battling monsters, Pacific Rim is definitely worth watching once. And make sure to watch it on a big TV with a good sound system. Unfortunately, I don't think there will be a need to watch it a second time.<br /><br />Overall: 2.5 stars.
B00GGEVKYO|5.0|I enjoyed reading the Hobbit / Lord of the Rings books so I looked forward to seeing the movies as they each were released.<br />I was not disappointed!  The transition from print to film was faithfully done.  I believe  the success of the film franchise came from a very strong cast of talented actors, and a director who while being creative stayed true to the story.  Another plus was the beautiful location where the films were shot which enhanced the feeling of being in Middle Earth.<br />I loved that this was the Extended Edition which added so much to the enjoyment of the film.

Once again, I really liked the straightforward, easy-to-read presentation along with links to online resources to keep the flow of advice going well after your read is finished.<br /><br />I found the explanation of inside and outside environments particularly valuable along with the discussion of consistency vs. change.  The fifth chapter on mastering change was probably my favorite.<br /><br />The author set the bar pretty high in previous works I reviewed and he continues to meet expectations with his latest effort.

Again,and again and again and again.<br />Of course, now I want my own Minions and I sure would like to be able to speak Minion-ese. I highly recommend it - even if you *think* you won't like it, watch it anyway. I dare you not to like Despicable Me 2. Double-dog-dare-you.
1451626096|4.0|Gregory pulls back the pages of history to give us a raw, gritty look of the start of the Tudor reign with &#34;The White Princess.&#34; Elizabeth of York has loved and lost and is now resigned to her fate, Queen of England. Henry VII has won a crown but lost in love. Can he build a dynasty to rule England without love?<br /><br />The novel opens with Elizabeth mourning her uncle's death. Henry Tudor has taken the throne as Henry VII, yet he is weary of anyone and anything once belonging to York. Having lived a hard life, he's suspicious of all, and this is his challenge: can he overcome his faults and inspire love in the people around him? It just might prove an impossible task with his mother at his side.<br /><br />The story belongs to Elizabeth, however, and not Henry. Here we see a young woman confident in herself, having been raised a princess. She assumes the mantle of queen with poise and grace, yet many plot to restore the beloved House of York to the throne. How Elizabeth manages the challenges in her life defines the type of woman she will be remembered for.<br /><br />Gregory's done her research and it shows, painting a vivid fictional backdrop against established historical events. It's said &#34;history is written by the victors,&#34; and Gregory proposes that's what the first Tudors, Henry and Margaret, have done. Her writing is easy and not overburdened by trying to capture 1500's speech patterns. While Gregory does suggest that Elizabeth of York was in love with her uncle, and that Henry VII took her against her will, these are suggestions and not established fact.<br /><br />The story slows in some places, and Henry's cries about the Yorks plotting against him, get old, but there's always a twist to keep it moving. &#34;The White Princess&#34; is full of suspense and heartbreak that will keep you turning the pages.

It is genuinely fun to see Steve Carrell's Gru go from sinister, hard-hearted villain to doting father of 3 orphaned girls. As with so many things life, it's not where you end up, but the journey that got you there that's holds the most importance. Superb animation and a great cast are just the icing on this funny cake. Watch it. You won't regret it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it makes you want to pull your hair out and play it some more. great game to play. I love to play this after work to help myself unwind.
B00005R87Q|4.0|It's too bad that I didn't see this movie in theaters (instead I saw it on DVD), because it would have been a much more exhilarating experience. Okay, so this movie isn't perfect. It's not groundbreaking or anything like that. But it's one heck of a ride from start to finish. The plot may be a bit derivative, but who cares? It's all about the cars. It's about the races. It's all about the action, the babes, the hunks (for the ladies, of course), the rock/hip hop/techno music, and more and MORE cars. Was Vin Diesel's acting decent? I guess you can say that. Did Paul Walker fit the role? Sure, why not? Were CGI effects added in? It sure doesn't look like it.<br /><br />I had a really good time watching this movie. I know it's not &#34;Godfather&#34; material, but it's not trying to be. It's a movie about racing and really really fast cars. That's all you would have to expect in a movie like The Fast and the Furious. I'd recommend this film to fans of cars and babes and action movies in general.<br /><br />Grade: 8.3 out of 10
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|A lot of variety.  Different than others.  Pretty good setups to play.  Played on my kindle, a nice little game to take along.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|Before watching this movie, I had very modest expectations. I'm not a fan of Superman (I'm not a fan of comic books in general). I did watch the first Superman movies that starred the late Christopher Reeve, though I can't really remember since I watched them as a little kid. When Man of Steel came along, I discovered that Christopher Nolan had produced it. Seeing as how I did enjoy his Batman films, I thought I would enjoy this one. When the movie ended, I had mixed feelings.<br /><br />First off, I will say that the special effects are quite spectacular. The music score from Hans Zimmer was a nice touch (even if it was a little unoriginal). Director Zack Snyder and the SFX crew did a real good job with the visuals. The set and costume designs looked quite impressive, and the dialogue didn't sound too cheesy at all. The action sequences didn't tend to drag: I quite liked it. I didn't mind the inconsistent flashbacks in this movie, since I actually did follow the film very well. Henry Cavill, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, and Lawrence Fishburne gave good performances, but nothing groundbreaking.<br /><br />So there's that. Then, there were the things that bothered me about the film.<br /><br />For some reason, I didn't like Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Not only did she not look the part, but her acting seemed very wooden. I'm sure Adams is a wonderful actress; I just didn't see the evidence in this specific movie role.<br /><br />And speaking of Lois, the romance between Clark Kent/Superman and Ms. Lane didn't prove to be effective in this movie. I couldn't feel the chemistry between the two. I'm not sure if it's because of the way these characters were handled by the writers or the director.<br /><br />And oh boy, General Zod was one heck of a DULL villain. He didn't seem very threatening when onscreen, and he didn't have that authoritative appearance. Although Michael Shannon did his best with this character, I don't think I'll find Zod to be a favorite of mine anytime soon.<br /><br />The climax...well, it didn't have that spark that could be found in many other action films. It felt too abrupt and it lacked that epic scope that you would normally find in Batman and Avengers.<br /><br />Man of Steel is not really groundbreaking material. The visuals are terrific, but everything else is either average or below. It's more of a &#34;style-over-substance&#34; approach that didn't really work for this type of film. I will recommend this film to those who love Superman (and comic book franchises in general). Everyone else will probably find this one mediocre. I know I do.<br /><br />Grade: 5.6 out of 10mine anytime soon.<br /><br />The climax...well, it didn't have that spark that could be found in many other action films.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is an excellent continuation of &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; in addition to being a new adventure which is fascinating.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think it is a grate game besides you have to wait for more coins.  Wen I first got it my dad showed how I did it.  You should get this game and rate it five stares. Yes I am a kid.
B000FBJHT4|1.0|Total Trash!  I could just as well give it no stars!<br /><br />Most claims are backed up by &#34;That's what I heard&#34;.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Silo Saga embraces classic dystopian themes that makes me think of Lord of the Flies; although a much more enjoyable read in my opinion. The first book in the series Wool pulls you in almost immediately as the characters are real, not fanciful, and the writing is excellent in that it is succinct allowing the story to unfold quickly yet retain a compelling mystery. The canvas for this story is quite limited, as you soon learn, but this allows the author to focus on the characters and dialog like a good play rather than be distracted by magic, fantasy or futuristic technologies - not that I have a problem with magic, fantasy or futuristic technologies. Wool is really a setup and leaves you constantly wondering why and how did this happen, the follow up Shift contains the answers and flips backward and forward in time seamlessly keeping me up late into the night. I'm still reading so I can't say much more but I've enjoyed it immensely so far. The only caveat is if you want something a little more light hearted then I doubt this is the book for you.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Really, I would give this 4.5 stars -- minus half a star for 2 reasons. 1) The book does carry on a bit long in a few places. 2) After about a thousand pages of build-up, the future/conclusion was wrapped up in a 5 minute read. I loved the book, I got lost in the time-warp, I loved the characters, I loved the historic yet not so long ago references. I was sad when it ended and now I don't know what to read. I feel like if I open a new book, I will be putting this story to rest and it was just soooo good, I want to savor it for a while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Pretty cool game, my niece loves it. We play this game all the time. So much fun. Really good for kids.
0307949508|5.0|Once I read his 1st book, I couldn't wait to read the other 2. It's just a shame that he died so young. He was a great story teller.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. I drive myself NUTS until pass the level. My friends and family tell me to install it on my cell phone but I REFUSE only because I would DRAIN my battery solely due to CANDY CRUSH SAGA LOL

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This media player works well. The Chrome browser has a good working add-on that makes it very easy to use the Chromecast device! It would help if more apps were created to work with this device!
0671449028|5.0|All books by Sandra Boynton are 5 star and I always hate to give them away (I read them again first).

B00770KR7W|3.0|Figure size not as big as I hoped for. Was hoping for a more full size Action figure for my boy to play with
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful book that gives you multiple perspectives on assisted suicide.  Really makes you ponder what you would do. Must read
0891419063|5.0|Great personal view of the worst fighting in the second world war. Horrifying in its intensity.  It makes you wonder how anyone could have survived.  This book should be a must read for all high school students and for all those who are still wondering if we should have A bombed the Japanese.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Exceptionally well researched, even, and objective appraisal of our government's struggle to safely manage and control our nuclear arsenal, while maintaining the capability to execute or respond to a no clear attack. Schlosser provides an  Eye opening account...and a true  public service.
0394818237|5.0|Great book.  Read it to my son many many times.  After a year he still chooses it often to read before going to sleep.
B00GK59HL2|5.0|I loved Primeval.  Seasons 1 thru 5.  The series was great.  It had it's cheesy moments in the beginning, but the stories were great and the CGI on the creatures was fantastic.
B002XXUWMI|5.0|This was a very interesting movie, the premise of a superior race playing a grand simulation game while trying to figure what makes humans human by swapping their memories.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R. Martin does it again with the fifth instalment of A Song of Ice and Fire. I can't wait for the next book.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Blood Song has a lot of good ideas implemented flawlessly.  I can't say there as anything to original going on here but I wouldn't say that is a bad thing. What Anthony Ryan has accomplished here is taking many ideas from a lot of great fantasy books and spun it all together better than about anybody I have read in a while.<br /><br />The main character is strong. While reading his journey I felt like I got to know him better than most protagonist from other fantasy novels. The world that he inhabits is a living and breathing world. It feels real instead of fantastic.<br /><br />I think the thing that stuck out most to me about this novel was the strength of the writing. Ryan is up there with Rothfuss and Martin for putting the words together.<br /><br />Another feat that this Blood Song has going for it is that even though it doesn't exactly break new ground in story and setting I wasn't able to see the story beats before they happened. It was nice to be surprised by the twist and turns.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book. Not only will I be reading the sequal but I am also going to read this over again. Anthony Ryan just made me a fan.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|This game lies to anyone who plays it. The robots have not  power and armor, and when you block and hit more, you end up losing because they put the robot  more power and armor. This game is unfair and cruel because it doesn't matter you much you block and hit, you always end up losing. When you block and hit more than the other robots, you still lose the match, it is unfair. :-(
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|This book shows the path that one of the great heroes of the war on terror became a SEAL.  Adam Brown had a storied and interesting life.
B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to use. hardly ever the same game. challenging with or without Internet. highly recommend to all ages. lots of fun
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and make you feel . As if you have stepped into another world.  It's easy to lose track of time as you play this game, solving puzzles and helping the creatures of this new world you've been transported to.  The downside to this game is that it ends all too soon, leaving you wanting more.  But for 99&cent; you won't be disappointed, that is if you enjoy puzzle games.  I played it on my Kindle Fire HD and it performed perfectly - no crashes, no lag.  More, please!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think the game is a little money but my mom let me get it and I was excited I got it because all my friends had it and I had no idea what to do but my friend Hannah McKee reached me how to play minecraft
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We like watching this show and how the characters are developing.  It is very entertaining! We can't wait to watch the next episode.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is ok but you should have more keys to start with so download but use your keys wisely in the game
B00GH4R95C|1.0|The movie is a mess.  Characters like Lois Lane, Ma and Pa Kent and Perry White could have been omitted from the film with only a miniscule, if any, effect on the plot. The plot and direction is straight out of the George Lucas Star Wars episodes 1-3 school of film making. Obviously, the more time spent with special effects/CGI the better! In the worst of the Christopher Reeves films you had no trouble finding Superman. I'm not sure if Superman was ever in this film. Oh, one last, albeit petty observation, with due respect to the greed machine of the &#34;New Fifty-Two&#34; I WANT TO SEE SUPERMAN' S COSTUME in the films and not some jumped up speed skater suit.
B00GINENG0|5.0|He is sooooooooooo cute it makes me sad when he grows up I love him so much I want him to stay a kitty lol but he won't
B0030MM68O|5.0|This is the first movie about the war in Iraq that I have been able to watch. My son was there in 2004 on a four person special ops team so this (I think) is as close as I will ever come to seeing what he experienced daily for a year. It is very well made and I did not notice the &#34;shaky&#34; camera work that some have mentioned. I don't know if it was technically perfect, but it gave a good peripheral view into what &#34;going on a mission&#34; means for a three or four person team riding in a Stryker vehicle through streets where - any person could be the one that takes your life. The emotional connections to one another and some of the Iraqi population are played well. The decision to pull the trigger or not and the long term stress of that daily consideration come through in this movie loud and clear. Even toward the end the mundane decision of picking out cereal juxtaposed to what the soldiers go through while in Iraq (including the life and death decisions) was well placed. I thought it an excellent movie about the stress of being a soldier.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book many years ago, returning to it in anticipation of the movie.  Even though I remembered the stupendous surprise, it did not spoil the story.  Truly an epic accomplishment.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun game for all ages unless you're not a brony then why are you looking at this app<br />Feel free to download this
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just bought my second Chromecast for my other TV.  This thing is awesome!  I simply gave it to my 11 year old and he got it all set up.  The picture is so much clearer.  I was using a Samsung Blu Ray player before but playback just wasn't working that great and Chromecast did the trick.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Enjoyed this a lot.  It explained a lot about the book the shinning and added to this story.  A good read.
B00008G8LY|5.0|Terrific movie...shipped quickly so I could enjoy watching it soon after ordering it. Adventurous, great CGIs and good acting.  Just buy it.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Some bugs while downloading but I fixed them and otherwise its a great game for anyone who likes dc/fighting games
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Very well done, good story. Well acted. My only question is I wonder if Tom's &#34;church&#34; beliefs have anything to do with his movies? I know they do believe in some sort of extra terrestrials. Always makes me think twice unfortunately with Tom. But good story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best zombie shows ever !  I have watched them all and they have a great plot to them . I love zombie movies but this is the best show I have watched in my opinion !  Keep them coming please ! I watched them all on Halloween week to get into the Halloween spirit lol  . I give this 5* ! If you are into zombie shows this would be for you ...

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really loved this season & every episode . This is a good series for anyone who loves a good story line with a great twist and scare  . I have watched the 1st & 2nd American Horror Stories. They don't let you down ( well for me they didn't ) . I like how they use some of the same Actors from season 2 . I had watched that season first  ...  This reminds me of when I was younger and couldn't wait for twilit zone to come on . I LOVE AMERICAN HORROR STORY: ASYLUM !!!!!  I wouldn't let any young Kid's watch this because of the sex & of course it is a little to scary for Kid's I would think . I give this 5* for every reason I just wrote .
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Very interesting and better than I expected. Makes you think. Certainly some political messages and non verbal commentary on socio-economic classes.
B003B02O0A|5.0|As with all of Grisham's books a well written suspenseful read.  I recommend this book and all of his books to anyone that enjoys reading and has an interest in the law.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|The app is simple to use and manageable.  Twitter is an easy app in the first place so there is no way to go wrong with this purchase.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This Game is pretty awesome that it made me stop play my ps3, By the way did I say it was awesome
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorite game! Its the best game ever for me because I like to make things and this is exactly the kind of stuff I like. Its mentally challenging because you have to build everything out of squares. It rocks!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game in the hole intier world because is by DRAKE.H. just kidding it is by kiloo it is a good maker it's not like gameloft witch sucks
B00EIL7E9C|2.0|i think it available at some places now<br /> why is it not able here yet ?  woo wo woo woo
B0052QXAEK|3.0|I find the plot to be kind of creepy if it was to be compared to real life. I was bored because all of the trailers revealed the strong parts of the movie
B001F0WXY0|5.0|A Classic, needs to be read again and again. I love this book/series more each time I read them. My dad started my love of books and I am passing it on to my kids.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Ms. Krall is an outstanding artist and gives each song her personal touch.  Very enjoyable to listen to, especially in the car.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|There aren't enough stars to rate this wonderful story.  I volunteer at the local SPCA and learn of heartwarming rescue/adoption tales all the time.  This one tops everything.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters, and loved it. I've never been  big fan of Superman, I've seen a few movies and didn't like them, so when I went to see this I was skeptical, and I was pleasantly surprised. For one I liked that they went for a bit of a darker tone with this movie, especially when the villain was defeated, it showed that  no matter how much power you may have, not everyone can be saved, I can understand why some people don't like the movie, it did have some problems, but what movie doesn't these days. I feel the hate it's gotten is ridiculous. The actors were great, I loved the villain choice, and it was nice to see them go with a bit of a darker movie. This is by far the best Superman movie I've seen. I highly recommend it
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I LOVE THIS game lots of maps towers and I love it the game loads sooooo fast and its didn't take a long time to download<br />  I got the 4th one on the I Pod and its awesome and now I'm trying the 5th and it was free for me cause I got it on free app day<br />  I will never delete this app. #AWESOME
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|The movie was very funny and left u wondering what was going to happen next. Not appropriate for under 16 year olds. Adult humour

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Because it is a good game.  I love to play a couple of games while I watch TV at night.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|OMG my dh and I LOVED LOVED LOVED this movie!  We need to see it again!  There were so many subtle moments I loved but they went by so fast I want to go back and see what I missed- it was a very fast paced thriller with AWSOME HUMOR to die for!!!  I don't usually even bother to rate a movie, let alone give a 5-star.  If you want a very fun and wild ride, don't miss this one.<br /><br />This is a sequel and believe me the first was as good as this sequel.  My dh and I are planning now on buying both.  These are two rare movies that we actually will buy and WANT to WATCH AGAIN!

B000000OMB|5.0|This is a personal rating.  This album/CD came out in 1982.  It was one of two top albums that summer.<br />That period was a very intense phase of my life.  I successfully survived it.  That is why I like it.<br />The lyrics of several of the songs are contradictory.  The instrumentation is fantastic.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|as i have said, ... great series, .. well worth one's time, ..<br /><br />if possible, watch them at one go, back to back to back,<br /><br />really grabs one, .. and the evolution of the characters ... so believable!

B00FAX6XQC|1.0|This is not much of a game.  It is in the forest, you find the buck and shoot it, blood spurts out and GAME OVER!! That is it!!! Then you have to buy a whole series of other games/apps to go with it to continue so though it was free it was waste of time downloading it! Thank you but NO THANKS!!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|excellent series,... had never watched even one episode, waited for the series conclusion, .. and bought the first season,... great!,.. immediately purchased the remaining four season, .. watched them back to back to back,.. logical & believable character development,...<br /><br />i highly recommend this series, ..

B00BAXFECK|5.0|I read, and re-read, The Secret History, by Donna Tartt, many years ago. I loved that book and was excited to find this recent novel. It is long, and dragged for me just a bit in the middle, and yet, I could not put it down and was so sorry to have it end. Impossible for me to write a brief summary, and I will be thinking of the themes for quite a while before reading it again. Tragedy, love, loss, beauty, meaning and meaninglessness, fate, death, choices, oblivion, awareness, just some of the words that come to my mind having just now finished The Goldfinch.<br />Not a light beach read, rather the opposite. Recommended for people who ponder what it's all about, and don't want or need things all wrapped up neatly with a bow.
006202406X|1.0|To be completely honest I regret reading this series because of how this book ended. If your reading these reviews you've probably read Divergent and Insurgent already. Do yourself a favor and don't even bother reading this, it'll only disappoint you and break your heart. Ughhh I can't believe I wasted my time reading this!
1449437524|5.0|This is such a cute book. It is something I can read to randomly brighten up my day. Goes well with a warm dog in your lap.

There are also too many in game purchases, I gave it two stars because it could be great... those glitches :( and I paid for the game so I would expect no bugs and glitches. PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM I PAID MONEY I WANT WHAT I PAID FOR!!!
1476747016|5.0|This was a very nice coffee table book for people who like to have fun rather than educational coffee table books. Who doesn't like looking at Pusheen the Cat doing cute things?  The book came in great condition as well.
B001QFZADA|3.0|I enjoyed learning about each of the 5 love languages. Knowing my love language will help me in my relationships.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I would be embarrassed to tell you how many times I have watched the last half hour. Because endings are the best part.
0345803507|5.0|Great ending to the trilogy.  I could have kept reading about them forever but sadly the story had to end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy download easy install and easy to use.  It is large and easy to enter numbers.  I like it and use it often
B000XVSU9O|5.0|A true story of her supernatural journey to Heaven to meet Jesus and discover the true meaning of life and our existence here on Earth
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Very funny and worth watching! It was a little crude for a few family members who watched it with me.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Couldn't read fast enough in some parts. Love the idea of having jack narrate it. Very believable story. Read it in just a few days.
B00GFOIUVQ|2.0|Purchased some in game coins and it deleted my account and created a new one, I restored my previous account before realizing it had applied the coins to the new account. Gameplay is good but lacks a bit in usability and clarity.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|I played this little bear game, the first time on my computer back in 2007. I loved it then, and I love it now. When I saw the app, I was excited to see the little free bear again. I'd like to see more of him, like his golfing. Anyway, the bear sits in an innertub, and using your finger you pull a big rubber sling shot back, and propelling the bear toward a set of bowling pins down an icy bowling lane. The bear will either knock down all of the pins, or some of the pins, either way, you'll hear some cheers in the background. It's really cool.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|The acting in flight was great. The subject matter of substance abuse, denial and self destruction is dark.  Worth watching.
0307592731|5.0|Ab fab book! I am a hiker and found it both hilarious and enlightening. Non hikers will love the adventure and her absolute honesty.
1118156315|5.0|I wish this book had been around early on in my career, or maybe even before I went to college! It is very useful to help you figure out what you really want to do or should be doing, using the Business Model Canvas from the book &#34;Business Model Generation&#34; (which is a must-read for anyone serious about working in a business/corporation or starting a business, in my opinion).<br />Aside from the content itself, I love the design and layout of the book, and it is a pleasure to read. I also love the fact that hundreds of people from all over the world contributed to the creation of this book.
B009PHRIKE|4.0|I've had all five of these albums on LP for about thirty years and it's nice to have them all collected in one box.  Lots of memorable themes and melodies (although I still think the &#34;Enigmatic Ocean&#34; compositions are rather dull and uninspired-- nice funky groove on the last track, though).  Good playing, too.  Despite a tendency to repeat a few pet riffs too often, Ponty obviously knows his axe inside out.  The lightning-fast fillip at the end of his violin-and-drums break in 'New Country' will make you wonder, &#34;How could any mere mortal have the dexterity to navigate that?!&#34;<br /><br />In a sense, this box is a mini-history of the changes in jazz-rock fusion in the second half of the '70s.  Early on, things sound more warmly 'organic' with somewhat of a balance between acoustic and electric. As the '80s approach, you can hear the rhythms tighten up and the overall sound become a bit colder and more sterile.  Put another way, the funk and folk influences gradually diminish in favor of a more brittle rock sound.  Still, the last album, &#34;Cosmic Messenger&#34;, has plenty of fine stuff.<br /><br />The main problem with Ponty's '70s albums, to my ears, is that they sound too composed, too controlled, too CONTAINED-- it never seems as if anything very spontaneous or unpredictable could be allowed to happen, so the excitement and emotional power are somewhat reduced. (Darryl Stuermer's fine, bluesy guitar work, somewhat reminiscent of Zappa, does threaten to break out of that box from time to time.) Nevertheless, this set has some of the best composing, arranging, and playing of the jazz-rock era of the 1970s-- or prog-rock.  If you're a fan of groups like Yes, this stuff should be right up your alley!<br /><br />A tech note:  I've purchased a number of these 5-disc &#34;Original Album Classics&#34;/&#34;Original Album Series&#34; boxes, such as Passport, Stanley Clarke, and Spirit.  All of the others have had some technical sloppiness in the remasters-- audible hum, botched fades, etc-- but on the Ponty box the mastering sounds flawless, allowing you to enjoy the music as it was originally heard, with no unnecessary distractions.
0061733199|5.0|Very good book, has alot of information that will come in real handy, should anything happen or some stuff just good to know. Never can tell these days what is going to happen next
B0017HMF6W|4.0|A bit tame by todays more violent standards but still a classic & well worth watching. Probably the best picture that I have ever seen it presented in.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|well told story of a remarkable lady in a man's world of 19th century natural science, both entertaining and enlightening
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|I saw this movie at the cinema & quite frankly felt something was missing.  Well a whole sub-plot was deleted from the movie & with this extended edition a lot now makes sense.<br />The music is exceptional & haunting.  Some great acting, although if I could criticise anything I would say that Orlando Bloom was a bit too young for the part he played.<br /><br />I thought it was more than fair to both sides in the conflict, unusally so. Great battle scenes.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Usually finds the link I want. Is fast and easy to use any time. Offers many options and links to choose from.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I thought Royals was overrated at first but then I got hooked and started listening to the album on Spotify...it truly is one of the best CDs I've come across in a long time. Lyrically genius, deeply profound and touching. I love her voice. There's not a song I skip. I'm impressed. Highly recommended to people with hearts and brains who enjoy music with some substance.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent. very enjoyable makes you work hard keeps you guessing. Best mind bender yet. I reccomend highly. I promise you will enjor it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love it great conclusion this is my 3rd time reading it and I have enjoyed it every time wish there was more to look forward too
0316322407|5.0|I am very pleased with my perchase. The package was in good spape and got to me quickly. My  son will love this
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Hopefully it'll get better. It's pretty slow to respond and it will disconnect from my phone and there's no way to stop it then without rebooting the device. I am not sure I'd buy it again, but I'm also pretty sure they will update it and it'll get better.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I am very pleased with my perchase. The package was in good spape and got to me quickly. My son will love this
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love to play on my kindle. really enjoy the game. the game can be addicting.  This is one of the better games
1451666179|5.0|As always, Allie Brosh comes up with the most hilarious stories and pictures!<br />Having this book by my bed makes me giggle every time I see the cover.
B009RH973I|1.0|Frankly after reading the reviews I purchased this for my new Kindle 8.9.  32 days later my son dropped my kindle not even a foot off ground. This did not Protect the kindle at all. my other covers have always protected the kindles even from a much higher height.  The Kindle now has spider cracks. even though this is an &#34;approved&#34;  and recommended cover for the kindle, neither Marware nor Amazon replaced the Kindle.  I still have to use this cover and kindle!<br />Part 2 the cover does not work when trying to view the kindle in recline position.  When I finally replace my Kindle I m back to the leather cases.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I would have never guessed the ending!!! Great book & love that it wasn't the usual predictable story! I'd recommend this highly
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|Loaded this game in hopes of getting another little time waster, well I couldn't even play it! Not even worth it even if it is free!
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Unique voice and enjoyed but isn't going to ever be my favorite Christmas album. Song selection was good but expected a few more tunes
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Quick and easy way to check on steam when you aren't on your computer! All the things I need are right there, Friends list, Daily deals and much more! Well worth the download!
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Not my favorite rod stewart album but nice. This guy has such a unique sound and musical talent its always fun to see what he does with a tune.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|Cute but I find that some of the rounds don't work on the Kindle, no point in having it there if you can't use it all!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Not up to par with other Grisham novels.  The story just  seemed too contrived. I had to force myself to keep reading it.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Yes it is creepy and yes it is fun.....BUT.....with only 2 maps it gets boring very fast. I guess it is one of those games that you really have to like it to keep it.

B00DBO1YMK|5.0|I had this playing as people arrived for Thanksgiving! I even played the DVD with the videos and yule log... We loved it! We played it while decorating the tree... it captures everything you want to feel and hear for Christmas!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is not your typical facebook game. It is fun,nice to look at and keeps me engaged. I really enjoy the quests. However I haven't figured out how to earn crowns.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Linear thinking out of the box... this is a nice way to kill time without baredom and a fair amount of fun.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Pretty detailed as far as the military training and diciplone. Most soldiers that have written books are a little full of themselves. Over all pretty interesting
B0026977EK|2.0|I normally don't write reviews, but couldn't not write one for this one.<br />This was so silly. Right from the title which sounds dumb in the first place. For the first half hour or more it almost sounded like characters are reading (not even performing/rehearsing) the script for the first time. And the narrator was so boring and irritating. He didn't say a thing that can't be explained without narration!..<br />Have to concede though beautiful actresses; the back drop of Spain is breath taking and makes u go to Spain on vacation right away. Penelope has done a good job.<br />I did finish it but that's just coz it's late night and I wasn't sleepy and like watching the beautiful actresses. 2 stars just coz of the beautiful Spain.
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|I love a good super hero movie. This one was entertaining, and had a decent plot and characters. That's all folks!
B004LWZW8I|3.0|I loved the movie 300 so much I purchased a copy.  When I saw this DVD (Immortals) was from the same producers, and was at a bargain price, I bought it. This movie  does have a great caste, with Mickey Rourke playing the vicious power hungry King Hyperion.  This mythological story is about the conflict between good and evil, which of course is an important part of any action movie.  King Hyperion is the insane and obviously totally evil person,  played perfectly by Rourke,  in this film. The mythic Gods have chosen Theseus (Henry Cavill) a common villager, but also a brave warrior, to lead the fight against the lunatic King Hyperion, whose desire is to rule the world.<br /><br />Even though the Gods wanted to stay out of the battle and desire Theseus to beat the King; nevertheless, in the end they wind up helping Theseus finally destroy the evil King Hyperion and his followers.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a fair story and it does have some great action scenes, but in my opinion it does not compare to the great movie &#34;300.&#34;<br /><br />Rating:  3 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale  (Author: The Samurai Soul: An old warrior's poetic tribute)
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read Sharp Objects do first and loved it. This book was not as good but still somewhat enjoyable. I didn't care for the ending. I do however love her writing!
B000001EGA|5.0|for those who haven't heard the music from this cd..buy it..youl love it..the opening track..captn fantastic and the brown dirt cowboy has it all.the quiet acoustic starting in..Elton john spinning the story from Bernie taupins lyrics..into a harder beat into a rockin beat with some great rough edge Davey johnstone guitar work that really pick up the pace...never a hit.but take a listen..its really good stuff.tower of babel rocks..gotta get a meal ticket rocks..and bonuses at end his lucy in sky with diamonds which is better then the beattles version and Philadelphia freedom..really great music..buy it youl love it
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game is cool<br />  and is amazing for while but after you get to the higher levels if you can t complete 1 or 2 levels  at the end of a world<br />you can t get to the next world
B00A2H9P98|4.0|I found it to be everything it was cracked up to be, lots of action and the actors were great.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|it was heart wrenching and the the bad guy got it in the end accordingly, it felt good to see the bad guy(lady) end up cleaning chimneys.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|If you love 1950's sci-fi movies like I do, this is one of the better, well done movies of the gender.  The sound and picture qualities are very good when compared to other sci-fi movies of the time period.  It is a must to add to your collection.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I picked this one up not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a game that had all I was looking for. This one is challenging enough, but not so bad as to stop you from wanting to continue. I finished in probably two or three hours, I lost track of time. Either way, it was fun and I'm very interested to play other games by this developer.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|The sound and picture quality of the dvd was very good.  I bought it on the recommendation from a friend without having seen it in advance.  It was so bad I gave it away...to the friend who recommended it to me.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is the best app ever because it fast nd free !!!  Also because it sends you a notification wen you get a message or ect.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I won't tell the background because you can read that in the description. I will tell you this is the first book by this author that I've read...and before I wrote this, I bought another one.<br /><br />This is an excellent book! I love how all of the characters seem to have totally separate lives, only to collide in one fateful moment.  I also enjoyed the &#34;what ifs&#34;, because let's face it, we all wonder how different our lives would be &#34;if only&#34;. The characters seem so human, something not all authors seem able to achieve. I'm looking forward to reading more books by this author.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It was such a fun and cute game like all the other cut the rope apps I can't wait to see the next era or age! It's so creative!!!

B00CE03UOC|1.0|Can we coin YASWFAOTD?  Both AdMob and AdSense are included in this.  Further, 'unlock all' requires a Facebook account.  Please get this just to rate it one star; the current rating is very inflated for some  'interesting' reason... ...<br /><br />I guess YASWFAOTD could also stand for Star Wars, both are as common nowadays.  I'll keep working on it...
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This game was far better than I had expected. It's a great and realistic game. The loading takes a while but it's all worth it! =3
B009AMANH4|5.0|This Blu-ray DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift for our son.  We saw the movie in the theater and really enjoyed it.  Since our son is a history buff and requested this movie, we thought we would purchase it as a gift.
B00DJUPLY8|4.0|Plays MP4 videos straight from my Synology NAS. I tried multiple Android players until I found this one. Looks nice too.
B000002J09|5.0|I really do feel sorry for the handful of morons who gave this album anything less than 5 stars. You obviously have no concept whatsoever of classic rock/blues rock. And I'm positive Jimmy Page and crew are laughing all the way to the bank as they continue to earn millions in royalties on all of their albums, and most especially this one.<br /><br />A few serious classic rock lovers might like another band (I am almost as big a Pink Floyd fan) from the same era better, but even those wouldn't be stupid enough to go out in public and say that Led Leppelin wasn't one of the greatest Rock and Roll bands ever. Much less that Jimmy Page wasn't a one of a kind master with the guitar and any other instrument he played.<br /><br />Don't tell me, let me guess. Your favorite rock band is the Monkees!
3832797033|2.0|Beautiful pictures, no question - but pretty much no text at all. I was hoping to also read about the history of the 911...
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Great family movie with great plot and good situational comedy.  Funny, insightful and great for a range of ages .
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Dark subject with flashes of brilliant light....thoroughly engrossing.  Perspective of narration is interesting and unrelenting.  Enjoyed diving into even the darkest corners.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Fun game but waiting for health and trying to get u to buy upgrades is annoying.... game play is fun kind of like the games in bars.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game, it is so addicting. Hate that you only get five lives and then have to wait or purchase more lives.
B006RXQBUC|1.0|I found the movie to be terminally boring . . . three hours of a hackneyed and totally predictable plot. Uninspired acting that at times looked like these fine actors were phoning it in. Glad I only paid a few bucks to watch this. If I had paid movie theater prices I would have been pretty upset.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|Brilliant and witty book.  Agatha deals with the Mafia in this one, solving an old crime and describing in detail retribution.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It works very well on my kindle fire hd. The graphics look great. The game is very additive. I am very satisfied with this game and would recommend it to someone looking for a good/fun puzzle game.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun! However, after a while the levels become so difficult that you have to buy helps to get through them. I am stuck on level 30, but I refuse to spend money on virtual lollipops.
0385743564|5.0|great read for kids recommend for everyone.enjoyed every minute of this book.Brandon Sanderson is one of the best are around now !
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is easy to use. My kids use it all the time. The only calculator I use. Thanks for making it easy to use.
B00F91H666|5.0|A moving testatment to the triumph of the human spirit.  A movie that really makes you think about the meaning of life.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Good game and really fun keeps you entertained for hours good graphics too for acartoon game overall i definitely wouldn't hesitate to buy if it weren't already free.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Decent game to kill time with. The in app purchases are kept to a minimum to be able to beat the levels.
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|This book contains a lot of amazing life tools for success in life. I highly recommend to people who are always looking to improve the quality of life. If you apply the techniques you will break through.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Theres nothing really special about the app itself. Twitter has so many clones that give you access with different features.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Heart touching. Don't give up on this one. This is the first of Amy Tan's novels to seem &#34;uneven.&#34; If not for assuming part of the mid section was repetitive because I'd experienced it in a short story of hers, I might have stopped reading. So glad I persisted! For those who love Tan and/or appreciate mother-daughter love, rebellion, resentment, etc., this is a novel to cherish. In terms of depth, it might be her best. I'm grateful.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a much better puzzle game than some of the others. It teaches the kids to learn control and problem solving.
0847842134|5.0|amazing amazing book.  get one while they are under $100!  previous edition have skyrocketed in price - just google.<br /><br />warning on shipping:<br /><br />amazon saw fit to put a massive and heavy book in an oversized box and a couple inflated buffer pillows...<br /><br />this glorious book arrived with some dents in the covers as a result.  previously complained and got no response.<br /><br />keep an eye on them.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Great little puzzle game. Its a little difficult for my 4 year old as he just wants to tap more but my 8 year old enjoys it.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|Good book to read to escape some of those stressful family gatherings.  There are a few surprises and it was very thoughtful.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|It was a nice new take on an old story and the acting was good, but I felt the violence went on a bit long. The story was not compelling enough to keep me really interested; as a matter of fact, I watched it on a personal device during a flight and had to turn it off about 20 minutes till the end. That was fine for me; I finished it a few days later.
0307887898|5.0|I read this several times and bought it for people who I want to work with.  Validated learning has helped me create a business that continues to grow and excite me.
1595141715|5.0|I am very happy with this book! It is a wonderful, emotional read! I do a lot of reading and can't say there is anything negative to say about this story.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|It is so hard to convey the impact of this book.  Every transcendent moment countered with pain, struggling with self, always searching for what is just beyond our Wondering if  he will find himself.  I will think about all this story challenges us to look to our own beliefs.
0375831002|5.0|Great book! Two boxes of tissues later, I was happy to have ordered this book! I love this and the movie just came out, too!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a blast.  I'm not a &quot;gamer&quot; but this is a lot of fun. Wish the intro/start after you die wasn't so long but I'm guessing that's to get you to spend real$
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This version of the flow game is not a whole lot different from the original but it does have better graphics and is just as fun so I gave it 5 starts
B004V9MU86|4.0|An unusual WWII Story, because it is told from two unique perspectives. At first the idea of the choice of narrator seemed a little contrived but worked very well. The story didn't take the path of the typical righteous Germans doing the right thing in the face of the holocaust though all the characters remained likable.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|this is a great book, good job by the author. I loved this series and the characters. a great storyline
B00FY2UFRM|5.0|They pulled everything they had for this one.<br />Adrenaline rush from beginning to end.<br />If you like the Fast & Furious, you'll like this movie.<br /><br />Setting up for Fast & Furious 7 ....?
0316055433|5.0|I want this review to intelligent and cogent, but I haven't had a chance to step back from the experience of reading The Goldfinch yet; I'm still living it, looking up close at the brush strokes.  I was afraid to start the book at such a busy time, start of the holiday season, etc.  Should I wait for summer?  But, five pages in last weekend, that decision was made for me--by the voice of Theodore Decker and by the brilliant writing of his creator, Donna Tartt.  I went to work.  I ate a turkey.  But the entire time I was lost in Theo's world, worried about the painting he'd stolen, thinking about the power of art and language. I wanted to the devour the book, but I also wanted to slow it down, because I knew that I wouldn't read a book this great for a long time, maybe another decade.  I finished it this afternoon and was so satisfied and moved by it--and a little sad that I couldn't explain the experience of reading it to anyone, not really, not even to friends who will also eventually read it.  There's a long section at the end of the novel where Theo speaks directly to the reader for the first time, and he touches on the ability of art to reach in and shake us--I think the simile is \\"like a power cord\\"--and this book has done that for me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book. I could barely put it down from the moment I started to read it. It is a fantastic gripping ending to the series.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|This is just challenging enough not to be too frustrating, and it doesn't make you add friends or spend game &quot;money&quot; to keep playing.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Read it in one sitting, had seen a special on him, this gave me even more info on the man
B00006HBUA|4.0|It is an excellent done movie that all would appreciate and not just fans of Scooby-Doo. It is fun for the  whole family.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thought I was getting a history on tesla, but I found it to be an inspirational read for myself as well. I really enjoyed the reading. Thanks.
B00005JKDR|4.0|This is a really funny movie. I love the characters in it and how they work together to survive. l think it is a great family movie
B0084TWN9K|2.0|The stories' characters were flat, the stories themselves were unresolved.  For that reason though, they would make excellent discussion topics for students in a school setting.Unfortunately, for a 57-year old woman, like me, the stories were rather boring.  I read for entertainment or education and these stories provided neither.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|My wife and I and our children and even grandchildren are all &#34;Chuck&#34; fans ... we were all so sad when NBC gave this show the boot.  Maybe there can be a &#34;Chuck&#34; feature length movie ... huh?
B00FATEJYE|5.0|When I first heard of the mobile game of Injustice I only heard bad things about it. I am glad that Injustice finally came to Kindle because this was an experience I was glad to have.  The game may be simple and time consuming but it is a great deal of fun and gives the opportunity to unlock New content for the console addition of the game. High my recommended.
B00006F7S4|4.0|great collection of music from such an eclectic artist. Takes a different direction with each album, which few artists can do so successfully.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock is perhaps one of the most tightly written BBC shows to come to this side of the pond in years.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|For this review I want to start by saying that I grew up on Paul's solo work during the 1980's. I know, I know, many would say this was his weakest period, but I'd like to point out that one of my favorite albums is 1986's &#34;Press To Play&#34;. Why? Well, it found McCartney experimenting again, changing his sound, modernizing it for the 1980's. It was met with critical praise but ended up being Paul's worst selling album at that time. I didn't get it, really. There were 15 tracks on there (if you go by the remaster). All 15 tracks work, and they are diverse in sound as well. I also liked 1989's &#34;Flowers In The Dirt&#34; and to a lesser extent 1993 &#34;Off The Ground&#34;. I own all of The Beatles albums and all of Paul's solo albums and albums with Wings. He's done everything, pretty much--rock and roll, classical, acoustic, covers, standards, electronica, etc. At 71, I found &#34;New&#34; to be surprisingly strong and well done. I think it continues the winning streak started with 2007's &#34;Memory Almost Full&#34;. It's light years better than last year's &#34;Kisses On The Bottom&#34;.<br /><br />On &#34;New&#34; McCartney's idea to work with four different producers pays of quite well, adding the diversity he was seeking while maintaining a coherence as well. The songs, for the most part, work well here with McCartney playing to his strengths. For example, I thought &#34;Appreciate&#34; was reminiscent of something that might have been found on &#34;Press To Play&#34;, and &#34;Early Days&#34; and &#34;New&#34; have a Beatles flavor to them. Why not five stars? Well, for me, starting with &#34;Hosanna&#34; things get a little shaky. &#34;I Can Bet&#34;, &#34;Looking At Her&#34; and the two bonus tracks, &#34;Turned Out&#34; and &#34;Get Me Out Of Here&#34; all make for an uneven ending to an album that starts of incredibly strong with &#34;Save Us&#34;, &#34;Alligator&#34;, &#34;On My Way To Work&#34; and &#34;Queenie Eye&#34;.<br /><br />Still, these are small quibbles. &#34;New&#34; is a solid, recommended, four stars. Elton John turned out a great album at 66 this year, and now Paul McCartney has done the same. Keep it up boys.<br /><br />Here's how &#34;New&#34; compares with Paul's previous works:<br /><br />The Beatles:<br /><br />1963 Please Please Me: Three Stars<br />1963 With The Beatles: Three Stars<br />1964 A Hard Day's Night: Four Stars<br />1964 Beatles for Sale: Three and a Half Stars<br />1965 Help!: Four Stars<br />1965 Rubber Soul: Four and a Half Stars<br />1966 Revolver: Five Stars<br />1967 Sgt.

B0081336FO|5.0|Sherlock is perhaps one of the most tightly written BBC shows to come to this side of the pond in years.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Yikes! It feels like the author has lost control of the story. By book 5, one would think some of the parts would begin to come together, but instead the parts are INCREASING with no sign of ever being united again...
0307279189|4.0|A good story, well written.  It keeps you engaged for the most part.  It also opened my eyes to what has happened to my feet over the years thanks to podiatrists, and the orthotics they prescribed.  The light went on when I read the part about barefoot running.  Now I know why my feet went from being a size 12 with high arches, to being a size 14 with almost flat feet!  It's because we wear the wrong types of shoes, we start wearing custom made, prescription orthotics, and we run the wrong way.<br />The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because toward the end of the book there is a bunch of stuff about man's evolution and how it relates to running.  Me personally, I don't buy into all this evolution baloney.  I believe the creator made man pretty much just the way he is today.  There may be some variation within a species, but that's about it.  I don't believe in evolution from one species to another, so I got bored with the pages that talked about evolution.<br />Other than that, it was a good story with a lot of good info.  A real eye opener for anyone with foot problems, and/or running injuries.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It does what it says on the can<br /><br />It simply works as well as the original on the kindle does
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books hold me capture to Katniss and her fight. The horrors of what has been done and finally the frail victory. Love love love these books.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game I think it is great but I think it should be cheaper to expand<br />Think about it kim
B00005JLIU|5.0|I love this movie! The music is wonderful and it is funny. Who can resist Julie Andrews? John Gavin is so handsome!
B000WGWQG8|3.0|Although it was a little long and slow at time, it is a good history lesson. The acting was exceptional.
B00EJXX17S|5.0|Lindsey is the best Musician of the &#34;new&#34; World! Her music shows everybodys best Character sides. She is absolutly awesome, not only for classicaly Violinists. Also for modern music fans.
B00EK0UBPU|1.0|Disappointing and obvious is how I would describe this book - my problem I think is because this book is set in the same area as The Bone People - a previous Booker winner by a Kiwi Author I somehow expected it to capture me in the same way as this is a part of the country in which I have lived and The Bone People remains my most read book ever - I seem to take it off my bookshelf once a year and settle down to read it in the most comforting way.  I had to force myself to finish The Luminaries feeling somewhat bewildered and sad as I had expected so much and felt I was missing out.  Frankly if this is the standard of writing that we should all aspire to then it is time lto put away books forever
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love it because I can listen to ONE DIRECTION and HUNTER HAYES.  it works amazing and it is the best music app ever
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Sanderson has done it again. I'm looking forward to the next installment. It grabbed me from the first page and held me to the last.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Great flick.  I don't understand the hate for this movie.  Many people love to point out the flaws in this movie and ignore the same flaws in the Donner Superman movies just because of there love of Christopher Reeve.  An example would be that Superman kills Zod in this movie, which according to the haters is unheard of, but then they are willing to ignore the fact that Christopher Reeve killed all 3 kryptonian criminal in Superman 2.  ( the deleted scene doesn't count.  It was deleted). Another example is the haters complaining that Superman let Metropolis get destroyed because he was on the other side of the world......saving the entire world!!!  But then the haters ignore the fact the Superman was a selfish jerk in Superman 2 and let Zod destroy and take over the entire world so he could spend some \\"quality time\\" with is lady friend as a human.  Lame.  I'm a life long Superman fan and this is the best Superman movie ever.  It is not perfect.  A bit to dark and colorless but still the best.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I was happy to see you can play the entire game with out hidden apps.  I would definitely recommend this to others.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I played the original flow and this version has some nice improvements such as cool sound effects. Runs smoothly and has a nice amount of levels to play through. I have only done about 20 levels so far but there are no lives to worry about, no ads or anything that tries to get you to pay more money to continue to play. Levels are not luck based either. I recommend this and if you enjoy the free version you will like this one too but expect basically more of the same.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|It makes sence now on how things got started with the group. and its very action packet show love it :)
B00BATG18K|1.0|It was boring.  Too much description, not enough substance.  The story would have been more interesting as a short story.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Amazing...simple ...addictive...fun...sexy...hot...can't put it down... But when 8 people play at once it just gets so crazy!!!we like to play &quot;Strip Neon Flow&quot;...that's when you have to take off a piece of clothes every time you mess up..then you have to swing your clothes over your head and scream &quot;I'm a pretty kitty!!&quot;
B001LF3YQK|4.0|This was a good idea and I have used it by attaching it to my stroller, but I did not realize that it had fallen open and all of the wipes were dried out when I needed them.  I will definitely check it before I take the stroller out next time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It does what it does very well. I like the ability to remote control from my mobile device.<br /><br />I knew this when I bought it, but it has a lot more potential than what is made available.
0143035711|5.0|The accounts of a Huey helicopter pilot in Vietnam.  As a recent Huey mechanic and air crew in the military, this was a MUST READ.  A great book if you are interested in any air combat, whether helicopter or fixed wing, interested in war, in history, or just plain a great read.  Easy enough for middle school level ready, exciting enough to want to skip a day at work.  I have goven so many copies to friends.
B008JFUN6E|2.0|Visually appealing, but I find it a bit ridiculous to need subtitles to understand one of the main characters in an American movie. Lead mercenary made me want to stop the movie at several points. Wait for it to become available as a rental, not worth buying.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was very entertained with how the story played out. I give the author a lot of respect for the choices she made and the direction of the story. I think a lot of people were displeased with the ending but I was not. I will not go into details and spoil the ending for anyone but I do think that this book was worth reading as was the first 2 books in this series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'm sure everyone is aware now of the phenomenon called \\"The Hunger Games\\" since the books and movies have made millions.  If you have not read the books thinking it's just a teen book, then you are missing out on a great read and a cautionary tale.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Second one of the series I've read and can't wait to get to the next.  Looking forward to the movie on the second book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun, clean interface, ads appear before each game but are easy to interrupt or bypass. I enjoy it and recommend. Mine is on my Samsung Galaxy Note.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Awesomeness for free and such. Thumbs up for this android phone app. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes YES type gamee
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have used this soooo much!! Love, love, love! When I can't download a particular video I want, I go here and get it. I'm in an organization and often there are videos uploaded to youtube that I can't download I need/want but can use this to get it
B00B7Y0206|1.0|it would not download on my Kindle Fire even though it said it was compatible. Perhaps it is only compatible with the Kindle Fire HD. I do not know
B004V9MU86|5.0|I am currently working my way through the top 100 bestsellers list produced by NZ Whitcolls. This is listed #12. I agree. It would be more or less where I would place it from my experience so far with a vast range of books I have read over the years. If you like a story which gives you some emotion, whether it’s laughing or crying. You’ll get the later with this one.<br />Read it and get it on your book list.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|told me how to play the game and how to finally win at playing chess.Very good book at great price
B0031RS4UM|5.0|I love all Jack Reacher books! I'm 38, a mother of three young children and I really enjoy using my mind to guess what is going to happen next. Who the bad guys is, So will you. Just try one.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|To fast!!!could not keep up with it make it as little slower it could be played easier please thank you
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This book was very thought provoking.<br />I’d never heard about it until I decided to read all the NZ Whitcolls Top 100 bestsellers. It’s listed #37.<br />I think I would list it higher on my own top 100. It’s a clever story aimed to teach us about life and its lessons.<br />I recommend it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this app is super awesome super fun super incredible realy good graphics and cool.  You will be glied to it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK.  GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND AN INTRIGUING STORY. iT MADE YOU WONDER WHAT YOU WOULD DO IN SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Was a really good movie to rent and watch! The movie has action, suspense, humor, and a little romance (not overpowering though). It was most certainly a movie to buy somewhere down the line. Most entertaining movie in a while. If you are unsure about buying it I recommend renting it like I did.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Love the primary colors that turn neon when completed.  Easy to learn and fun to play.  Relaxing and challenging all at 8nce
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|I got this as the FAOTD, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it.  If I had paid for it, I'd have felt cheated because it's too short.  I finished this in under an hour.  The graphics are good and the game functions well.  It was a little slow changing scenes, but not too bad that it's unplayable.  This is the typical point and click adventure game with very nice graphics and very little replay value.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Thought it was an excellent page turner and you never really knew till the end what was going to happen.  Found I  was really pulling for the characters in the book, all of them brought something special to the story......very emotional is all I will say without giving too much away
0761172726|5.0|We are in our umpteenth year of using these Mom's Calendars. Even though we are empty-nesters now and don't have as many kids to keep track of, I still like all the room for everyday appointments; I also use one or two columns for remembering past events like &#34;little so-and-so started first grade&#34; and so forth.<br /><br />The Old Farmer's Almanac has &#34;today in history&#34; events listed in their calendars and I decided to do the same.
0670024856|5.0|This is a gift for my wife. She requested it so I'm sure she'll love it. Books can really make a persons day. Quick, Easy & Painless.
B00DXPC1U6|5.0|Great show. I have watched the series from the beginning. The last episode was very good and suspenseful. This seasons set had some pretty good extras.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|man, i just love this cd. i listen to it all the way through every time.  but don't drive and drake.... you'll end up at your ex's house.
067101756X|5.0|A fascinating and true report about reverse engineering of Alien Space Ships.  It more than suggests that many of the digital microprocessors are a result of the reverse engineering.  A very interesting read.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Super cute, but I do not like how you have to be connected to the Internet to play or it uses a lot of data. A little frustrating for my daughter, she's 4.
B006ZS4GGK|1.0|You can save your wallet and try Barnes & Noble. They sell for what it is worth. NO mark up. This is horrible - over 90 bucks? Really?
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Liked the game, but it locked up my tablet and all my other games. Clearing cache didn't help. Deleted app.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I didn't feel like I was reading a novel but rather enmeshed in a life.  Brilliant writing.  I've read some wonderful books as of late but this one shined the brightest.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Took forever to load this app on my android, so I deleted the app. Never had the chance to play it.
1568363842|5.0|ordered this book for a course of study.  exactly what we needed as suggested by teacher for an evening course
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Cleans all system and app cache at once. Also clears residual app files like pop up ads that clog up my cache.  Use these features daily.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I admire Sanderson's brilliant imagination. He makes the characters come alive and shows even heroes can have a dark side to overcome. He also shows that anyone, even those who seemed to have lost hope, can become a hero. Awesome writer!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Boring, incipid and unconvincing.  I was very disappointed. If you're looking for an intelligent read, skip this one.  Writing level is junior high at best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it l can't stop playing it  you all needed to try it l tell everybody you all needed to try it it is so fun l love everything on my Kindle Fire HD tablet and Amazon.com. Thanks again.<br /><br />Love,<br />Patty Thilman
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Hard to believe that such a crazy movie about Christmas can be so true to life.  Enjoyable.  As you get older you<br />appreciate it more.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|OMG!  This is my favorite game ever.  I can play this game while watching tv, riding in the car, waiting in the doctors office and practically anywhere.  It is a mindless game that you quickly get addicted to.  I don't like the timed version that adds new blocks quickly before you can get rid of the old ones.  This causes me tremendous stress.  I like to cruise along at my own pace and try matching all I can on one side, then turn to the next side doing the same.  It is a good memory building tool as you have to recognize the symbols that can look the same but aren't.  Try playing in the frozen position where you can only play one side and are not able to spin the block.  You can go deep into the block and can very lightly tap just a sliver of a symbol and can make a pair disappear.  I love this game and have shown it to all my friends and have gotten them addicted.  The game is only $.99 so what do you have to lose!  This is great for all ages from 3 year old to old grandpa!  A great game for kids that have ADD or ADHD.  They can concentrate on this and it keeps them quiet and entertained without becoming hyper.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|deft worth getting it is really fun to play and you don't need to spend any money. just wish they would add some new cards and content other than that awesome game.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I lost my original Kindle fire (stolen) and the case it was in which was zippered.  As I ordered me another Kindle Fire HD I decided to get a different type of case which would close up and keep my Kindle in a type of sleep mode without turning off.  I ordered a purple one as I am a Red Hatter and I love red and purple.  I also ordered a purple external speaker.  I love the fact that I can use this case stand, sitting, lying down or any position and it gives good support.  When I tire of reading or playing games, I can close the cover and slip the elastic band over the front cover and my Kindle is protected and ready when I am to start up again.  I like the fact the cover is a hard case and not flimsy.  Marware has done a great job on its design.  It is still slimlined enough to fit in my purse.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B00E8G5HDW|4.0|This season has fewer episodes than others. And while the packaging says there are four disks, there are actually only three.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I love playing Bingo so I downloaded the app as it was a free game.  Thought it would be like the old timey game with you getting a card or two and someone would call out the numbers.  Was I deceived.  You have to play online with other players.  The numbers were called so fast I couldn't keep up and then you find out you have to start purchasing additional coins or tokens.  I feel like it was a ripoff so after one frustrating afternoon I deleted the app from my kindle.  This game may be free to download but certainly not free to play!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings kept me reading far into the night.  I couldn't seem to put it down.  Eagerly anticipating book two.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Well I donno it's ok I played it and its a little better than minecraft but u can hardly do anything u only have 15 minutes so enjoy it wile u can :/
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Purchased this for my 5 month old grandson. He loves to jump and play with all the activities. I would highly recommend this Jumperoo.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is really good it really needs a sequel and I wish the chapters Were longer but overall fun and exciting game one flaw is the mouths
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This book has brought back so many memories. Unfortunately as I grew older I had forgotten about The Little Prince and his message. Now I am able to share this great classic with my children.
B001VEE5KK|4.0|Movie had me in tears with so little words and lots of emotions.  A story of a love that never died...a story of truth and letting shame and fear hold you back...  Good movie!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book will open your eyes. Once you learn what Dr Davis has to say you will never look at the world of breads and grains the same way again. Much of his research just makes sense!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Great game!!!!!!!!!!! Love playing and the colors are great and fun! Download for a fun and tricky game to play
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|So honest. Nothing suger coated.  It showed this man warts and all, just like a real person. I liked the ending. I was surprised by it, but it was a good ending.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|not too bad a game I don't really care for the timer or for only being able to play for so long before running out of energy
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I think this app is good for you and you can follow a bunch people!!! I love this app because you can talk to people who u have followed and who has followed you!!! This is a really good app. So get it!!! Also you can connect with friends near and far. So again as i say GET IT!!!
B005Q4CKI0|1.0|This movie is very morbid,Why would anyone want to see a movie about 2 lesbian teenagers in love,and killing their  mother? where is the talent?..don't waste you'r time and or your money on this crap.
B00EO10M54|5.0|Excellent album. Probably her best so far and over the top compared to Katy Perry and Lady Gaga. Has different style variations on every song, so you don't feel like you're hearing the same thing over and over. Vocals are excellent and you would not have expected that from her natural raspy speaking voice. Despite what some think of her show-man-ship, you have to listen to this new CD. Good job Miley !!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The game is challenging, creative, and just fun to play.  I've enjoyed playing the game and attempting to get those blasted piggies.  Good job
B00DJZR46G|3.0|Been a Elton fan since he first started singing (seen a few live concerts with my wife also). Maybe it's me but I feel this album is lacking the great band that backs him up. His solo efforts are outstanding and he is no doubt a very talented piano player, but the beat is gone and dance-like atmosphere in this CD. Perhaps I'm stuck on his greatest hits era ??? Obviously, we are aging rockers but we still long for the days when music had life. Elton has become a more serious artist as he ages ...and there is nothing wrong with that. But new songs with the silly &#34;Benny and the Jets&#34; theme would be a welcome also.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Purchased this on black friday, very disappointed.  Sadly, the google chromecast sucks.  Casts a chrome tab for two seconds.  Casts netflix with poor video quality and no audio for about 2 minutes.  I checked the router compatibility, mine is on the list.  The router is about 6 feet away from the dongle - xbox 360 and apple tv work fine.  Will be returning this on Monday.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I give it a &#34;Love it&#34; rating when actually it is somewhere in between Like it and Love it. Another great album by Katy but I think it is not her best to date. Yes, you should buy it, especially if you are a Katy fan. I think she came a notch down from the last album but her fans will still love it. She is a more down to earth artist and doesn't flaunt the sex side as much as Lady Gaga or Miley Cyrus. No doubt, having her album out the same time as Miley &#34;BangerZ will not help her sales. Don't worry, Katy is not going away. She'll be around for some time with more great music ....
B00E0SX118|5.0|My kids really love this movie.  I have yet to watch it but my sister has had nothing but wonderful things to say about it.  I love movies like this and plan on watching it soon!
B003L77GH4|5.0|Great quality. All the episodes were there. And the bonus features were intriguing, funny and really interesting. The price of this collection was great! It was so much cheaper than the average store. Great buy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't quite know what's so fascinating about this game but my autistic daughter absolutely adores it.  She's nonverbal but will gravitate to this game which I originally downloaded it for my son.  She has completely taken it over.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it made me cry and would recommend it every one. I enjoyed the most that Death was the narrator.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My Grandson loves it. He spends hours with it. I don't know much about it, but he gave it 5 stars.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I love it but I have a kindle fire hdx and I w a nth dungeon hunter 3 back PLZ!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I followed the guidelines in this book and easily created my first Kindle book from the MS Word 2010 document which I used for the Create Space printed version.<br /><br />By &#34;easily created&#34; I don't mean to imply that I didn't have put effort into the project. In BYBFK Amazon used MS Word 2010 as the example tool for creating the Kindle book, so that made my task easier.<br /><br />AFAIC, well done Amazon!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is amazing. it's just like temple run. it is really great and i would recommend it for all ages.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Surprisingly fun. I don't know if I'm out of the loop on cool games or if this is flying under the radar.
006202406X|1.0|The whole novel was poorly written compared to the first two. Roth kept slapping down far-fetched explanations with less action, rendering the book boring. What was &#34;outside of the fence&#34; was poorly explained, and some scenes were entirely unnecessary. Furthermore, she (SPOILER) continued to kill characters willy-nilly as if to prove a point that war and rebellion are lethal, which she clearly did in the first two books. The book was only exciting in the last 30 pages, in which she decided that in order to make up for the crappy writing, she would kill of the main character, Tris. I didn't even care about the following pages featuring Four or her ridiculous epilogue. I am INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED and will never re-read this series. I would prefer that she released another version of Allegiant that is better written with a proper ending.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Great movie, Matthew McConaughey is excellent!  All performers did a great job, Trace Adkins adds much to the film.  :-)<br />No doubt I will watch this movie many more times than I already have.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Don't like game as much as other people, very frustrating that you can only get 5 lives then have to wait hour to get more , a few hints would also help , some levels almost impossible to pass.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The only issue here that that book 2 is taking too long.  What an amazing epic!  Keep up the great work Brandon!
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Gut wrenching but so beautifully delivered. Honest but not biased. This film deserves a standing ovation. It could start a movement across the world.
B00EL8I8IS|2.0|If you have read the book, don't bother with the movie.  That is, unless you can convince yourself that it has nearly nothing to do with the original novel by Max Brooks.  I can understand the difficulties of adapting a screen play from the book.  The book followed multiple story lines and approached a very overdone subject in a fresh way. Each story line was not just interesting, they were engaging.  Not to mention that by the time you were done with the novel, you actually felt somewhat prepared for a zombie invasion and if that is not a testament to how good the book is, then nothing will be.  Basically, Hollywood screwed it up and reduced it to.... well .... er Hollywood.  Perhaps they should have given Max a shot at the adaptation.  The only thing that Brad's presence in the move added to was the box office draw.  His performance was flat, boring and did I say flat.  By the way, the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I do like to see things go boom.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I found that this game is very challenging and fun at the same time. Great for people with nothing at all to do so please tap ur finger on download and get it it's worth it.:)
B007HACDLK|4.0|you gotta love Pat Rapp. So ones gotta turn this in to a movie. Should be played by George Clooney
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game only thing I hate is waiting for is lives but when I get them I use them up fast
B0089LOG02|5.0|Now one of my all time favorite books... You won't be able to set it down. When it ends... You turn the page for more!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Very nice on my Fire HD.  Only reason it's not five stars is there's a little too much mindless crafting.  Grow oats, gather milk, make cheese, etc., over and over and over. Minor quip on my part.  All in all though, very nice
B00EH486AQ|5.0|My son has wanted this toy for some time since he saw the movie. He plays with it all the time. We received it quick and he loves it!
B000002I77|4.0|Tommy Bolin is the guitarist on these recordings. He is not with us any more. That alone might be a reason to listen to it. The real core of the record is Billy Cobham's unique drumming. If you don't like too much drums, this might upset you. If want to hear cutting edge drum stylings, check it out.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|One of my favorites.  Loved the tone of the film.  The disc includes the making, ect...  This film was done with a very low budget, which is another reason why its much appreciated.  Thanks Mr. Durabont.
B001NY4X46|5.0|This is truly a classic - great drama, great acting (especially by Ed Norton), great suspense, and wonderful twist at then end!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful character development.  Jane Eyre would have been jealous that someone else could do this era so well.<br /> Love it!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|One of the best parts of the book is the way one story metamorphoses into another.  A treat for book lovers!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It was very interesting and enlightening.  There may be some things you don't want to learn about Steve Jobs, but you do anyway, and what a truly remarkably mind he had.
1742200508|4.0|This is a basic travel guide.  I have not seen a bad travel guide.  I don't think that one travel guide is better than the next.  They all have different points of view.  So, I think it is best to look at at least two different ones.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|It's a good soap opera, but I had a feeling that they were running out of ideas for some of the characters.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I was excited to get this so my kids can watch old cartoons(chilly Willy, woody woodpecker, etc). Very disappointed. Every time I tried to open a video, it would kick out of the app and we couldn't watch the video. Deleting now.
067144901X|5.0|This is just another in of Sandra Boynton's books.  It's silly but fun to read and our grandchildren love it!
B0041T4ML4|5.0|The book has stayed with me in how it asks us to consider a  future drastically affected by genetic modification and climate change.  It's nit a horror story that makes GMO evil, rather it shows how various groups get ahead  or suffer.  Brings the bst creativity of good sci-fi.  In its own way it reminds me of the impact of the movie Gattaca and it's increasingly relevant perspective on genetic testing and expectations.
B00C5R8364|4.0|It's a good story and as always with Frederick Forsyth, well written and very well researched, but I found it a bit predictable.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I downloaded it to see what the hype was about but it's just a rip off of bejewled. Kind of weird with the whole waiting around half an hour for more lives. I'd rather spend that time getting a real life lol
B0046ECJBY|5.0|Fantastic book that could only have been written by a man that knows China better than most Chinese. A historical jewel that is a must read by anyone that wants to know why China is what it is today and how it got there. Having lived in China myself, I was surprised at how much I learned about the many questions that I've had about China. It is also a beautifully written book. I highly recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|There is no question that King tells a good story. Doctor Sleep is a great reprisal of Dan Torrence and tells us what has been happening.<br /><br />However, and King admits this in closing, it's nowhere as scary as the Shining. But as a complete story that wraps up the picture that started in Colorado, maybe it's better for it.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Liz Gilbert is among the very best writers I've ever had the pleasure to experience. I hope that she continues to be inspired so that we all may have a lifetime of pleasurable reading! SOAT (The Signature of All Things) is delightful and captured me from the very first word (which so rarely happens!). She creates Alma in such a way that I think almost anyone can identify with her, or at least have empathy for her, regardless of one's own personality and preferences. Furthermore, this novel is well-researched and most exacting in historical detail, lending only more believability to the story. In short, I highly recommend this beautifully rendered novel to anyone and everyone! Thank you, Liz, for a delicious experience!
B00D48BT5A|4.0|A superb examination of popular culture in the US during  the 1920's with particular emphasis on the period of the title. Written for the general public ( rather than as an academic text) it is as accessible as his previous work and weaves his several themes into a coherent picture.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|it wont start up and wont download I hate this I spent 5.00 on a game that wont even download. waste of 5.00
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this game would keep you from boredom for hours on end. its fun to try to kill the whole world with different types of viruses
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|It is the sequel the Shining deserved, not a Shining 2 but a real story about what happened to the young Dan Torrance.i was skeptical when I bought it, but it turned into a page turner, a SK classic! If your a fan, you have to read it!
B00CCCF4NW|5.0|Jon Hopkins rocks!!!!<br />hearing how he goes from huge beats to solo piano is always fantastic. insides is still my favourite album for now, but that maybe change with this album in my cd player :3
B0009F9O6W|5.0|In 1976 I read a review in STEREO REVIEW magazine to which I was subscribing. The review was by another subscriber who wrote glowingly about an LP by a group I had never heard of (VDGG). He stated that this particular<br />record was unlike anything he had heard before. He couldn't categorize it, stating that the music transcended categorization. And he concluded by stating<br />that it had changed his view of music and his<br />own life!<br />&#34;WOW&#34;!, I thought, what kind of music was on<br />this record that could have such a<br />psychological effect on an individual?<br /><br />As that reviewer stated it, &#34;the record is PAWN HEARTS by Van Der Graaf Generator&#34;.<br />So naturally I went out and bought the record. And after one listening, I understood what that reviewer meant. The music on this record was unlike anything I had heard before (which consisted mostly of hard and acid rock as well as groups such as Genesis, Camel, King Crimson as well as classical music.<br />This album immediately became my most listened to record and I promptly went out and bought a second copy. Since then I have also purchased a cd of this recording.<br />And, after reading a recent review here on Amazon regarding a positive remastering of<br />the original recording, I decided to buy this remastered version.<br />This newly remastered cd was like listening to the music for the first time! The sound on this cd is unbelievable. This is what a digital recording should sound like. The performance is as fantastic as it ever was. And the additional tracks add to the overall value in the purchase of this cd.<br />Obviously, this is among my favorite of cds.<br />If you haven't heard it yet, I don't know what you're waiting for. If you're ready to expand your musical horizons, (cliche or not),  buy this cd.<br />It just might change the way you 'view' music.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Absolutely love the game. Fun easy and addictive :) with so many levels there is fun for everyone! Love the colors and everything
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|I loved the historical botanical theme, the relationships between people and people, people and plants, and between beliefs and cultures
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This work fantastically with Netflix. I was forever trying to find a way to watch Netflix on my television without paying $100 for Roku. This is defiantly worth the money.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging, I love games that get harder and harder, and it gives me a challenge I love indeed.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|What a disappointing movie.  Full of logical inconsistency and needlessly obtuse plot elements that break immersion.<br /><br />First, the special effects are fine and the acting is passable.  The plot is what it is, extremely predictable for this type of movie in the sense that the direction is plainly telegraphed to the audience by wanton 'you are dumb' expository dialogue.  Don't bother looking for any red herrings trying to throw you off.<br /><br />What really burns the audience at the end of the day is the internal inconsistency with the movie.  Everyone can accept bending physics for a movie when it is done in a consistent manner.  However, in this movie, the giant mechs (Jaegers) are seemingly both fragile and indestructible depending on the scene and the end result needed.  Similarly, the choice of the human race to erect a giant wall around the ENTIRE Pacific Rim instead of another more logical reason to dismantle the Jaeger program is lol-worthy.  Like, say, giant fixed emplacements of the Kaiju destroying projectile weapons found ON said Jaegers, negating the need for rock-em-sock-em robots.  This would have seemed far more reasonable and of course would have had far less precedent for failure than walls, which have worked exactly NEVER in human history as a permanent solution to anything.  Much less against monsters which have seemingly no trouble dismantling Jaegers with many times more robust armor plating than is visible during the construction scenes.  Unless it is one of the scenes where they need to be truly damaged instead of just a Kaiju love tap, of course.  Also, I can't tolerate movies which ignore ammunition in some scenes and then make it a critical issue in another.  Either the magazines/charges/rounds are unlimited for action purposes or they aren't.  It's just lazily inconsistent.  Like having giant swords which, while extremely effective, are only used after all unwieldy makeshift weapons are exhausted.<br /><br />But don't get me started with some of the stupid scripting choices made by Del Toro.  This ranks with the worst of sci-fi and military movies:  poor dialogue choices due to a lack of a basic understanding of the subject matter.  For instance, a nuclear reactor 'melting down' does NOT cause the equivalent of a fission bomb.  In fact, an effective power generating nuclear chain reaction is mutually exclusive with an explosive chain reaction due to the fuel enrichment levels.  I expect a high school student given a few cool prototype Jaeger action figures in exchange for reading the script could have easily said 'maybe they should just call it a self destruct?'  Further, the EMP blast which disables all Jaegers except the protagonist mech, Gypsy Danger, could have easily been explained by it being the only mech around back when they considered nuclear weapons viable and thus it was the only one hardened against EMP.  But no, we are told that 'it is analog'.  No, I'm sorry, the giant digitally controlled fly-by-wire robot with mind reading computer system is not 'analog'.<br /><br />It's so utterly frustrating to find a movie where the director and producer obviously care about the production, but just not enough to check their own work.  I feel like Del Toro was so excited to be making the film (as evident by all the sneak peak featurettes before the release) that he forgot to do it well.

B000000WJK|5.0|Read the reviews here and think if you can find any other CD that has so many off-the-chart reviews. You owe it to yourself to spend less than 10 bucks for a total masterpiece in music. I have purchased numerous copies for other people, and an extra copy for myself just in case it ever goes out of print. This truly is an album you must own and listen to repeatedly the whole way through. I am not some Verve groupie and I didn't swoon over &#34;Bittersweet Symphony&#34; or the other better known Verve songs. I can simply say that I can't think of any other album in my long listening life that has so deeply affected and inspired and touched me, and that includes all the known masterpieces like &#34;Abbey Road,&#34; &#34;Dark Side of the Moon,&#34; and &#34;Zenyatta Mondatta.&#34;
0307474275|4.0|Dan Brown's newest book, Inferno, just came out this year and I decided to start from the beginning and read through all the books in the saga. The Da Vinci Code is the second book and Brown once again crafted an electrifying tale filled with mystery and puzzles.<br /><br />Once again, Robert Langdon is called upon to utilize his expertise in symbology in a mystifying death of a prominent museum director. However, things take a turn for the worst for Langdon and he begins a journey running across Europe. Similarly to Angles and Demons, Langdon is accompanied by a woman. Sophie Nevu is a cryptologist and together, the pair works to complete the timeless quest of finding the Holy Grail.<br /><br />Dan Brown is amazing at tricking readers and letting them have time to try a figure out the same puzzles the characters deal with. This book contains many instances of this. I would be reading through the story and a small sentence would stick and and make my mind whirl trying to connect previous details and come up with a guess of what could happen.<br /><br />However, I felt that this book was a little bit slow. A lot the book I felt was dialogue between the characters just describing the background of the Holy Grail or the background of the characters themselves. I understand the need for building up the characters and the background of the Holy Grail, but to me, Brown didn't spend enough time fleshing out the conflicts and problems.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is still a really good book. It combines historical quests, puzzles, mysteries, and art into a thrilling book. I enjoyed reading it for the most part and believe that many others will as well.

0545586178|4.0|Writing a sequel or continuation to a book is not the easiest of tasks. The audience that carries over from the previous book sets their own expectations of not only the quality, but of the plot itself. The hard part is trying to please both the established fan base and new readers, balancing new content and twists with familiar characters and environments from the previous book. In Catching Fire, Suzanne Collins does a great job of taking the story of Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games, and building off of what she had built already to create a well-written story that is strong enough to attract new readers without straying too far away and alienating old fans.<br /><br />The book picks up from where The Hunger Games left off: Katniss and Peeta have returned to District 12 after winning the 74th Hunger Games. President Snow makes an appearance and threatens Katniss and her family if she doesn't help quell the possibility of rebellion among the districts during her Victory Tour. Afterwards, it is time for the 75th Hunger Games, which is made special because it is a Quarter Quell, celebrated ever 25 years. For this Quarter Quell, the tributes are to be reaped from the existing pool of victors. Katniss is once again going back into the arena.<br /><br />If The Hunger Games was filled with too much romance for you, then you'll find yourself drowning in it again when you pick up Catching Fire. This time, the conflict between choosing Peeta or Gale becomes the most pressing problem of the book with many pages and passages dedicated to Katniss' internal argument with herself over who she does and doesn't love. Once again, for more, I didn't like this emphasis on her romantic troubles, but I know many others who do. It does help more concretely define Katniss' and Peeta's character as the story progresses, but it still just becomes very tedious as she constantly switches back and forth between Peeta and Gale.<br /><br />I actually enjoyed how the plot allowed Collins to flesh out more of the characters than in the Hunger Games. The core characters, such as Katniss and Peeta, were already well developed in the first book, but Collins spent some more time returning to their pasts and played around with their morals and judgement. She also spent time taking a look at the different tributes that would be part of the Hunger Games. With the idea that they all know each other, Collins had to start creating the back stories for them in order to develop the sense of camaraderie between them. I felt that I got to know more of the characters a lot more than in The Hunger Games and was all the more devastated when one or another died.<br /><br />The ending, however, didn't do the book justice. It was just too abrupt, ending right after the biggest moment in the book and didn't resolve any of the issues presented previously. There is no doubt that Collins wrote it with a sequel in mind, but it shouldn't take away from the overall quality of ending the book you are writing at the moment.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a great sequel to Collin's first book in the series. It takes everything that came out of The Hunger Games and built upon it and expanded upon different ideas. Collins focused more on the characters than the Games or events that surrounded the plot and I enjoyed this movement towards learning more about the people I have come to know. Some of the things I didn't like about The Hunger Games resurfaced here in bigger ways, but some others may find it perfectly okay. Catching Fire is not as good as the first, but does take a different approach and has a completely different feel to it.o flesh out more of the characters than in the Hunger Games. The core characters, such as Katniss and Peeta, were already well developed in the first book, but Collins spent some more time returning to their pasts and played around with their morals and judgement. She also spent time taking a look at the different tributes that would be part of the Hunger Games.

There is no doubt that Collins wrote it with a sequel in mind, but it shouldn't take away from the overall quality of ending the book you are writing at the moment.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a great sequel to Collin's first book in the series. It takes everything that came out of The Hunger Games and built upon it and expanded upon different ideas. Collins focused more on the characters than the Games or events that surrounded the plot and I enjoyed this movement towards learning more about the people I have come to know. Some of the things I didn't like about The Hunger Games resurfaced here in bigger ways, but some others may find it perfectly okay. Catching Fire is not as good as the first, but does take a different approach and has a completely different feel to it.

0307950689|4.0|Man used to have a special knowledge, the Ancient Mysteries. Knowledge that changed the world and led to the golden age of many societies and humankind. But, the general populace has lost that knowledge that is now guarded heavily by different societies in the world. Advances in a field a science, called Noetic science has begun challenging the preconceptions of the power of the human mind and is on the verge of causing a worldwide intellectual renaissance. But now, one man has taken up a selfish quest to find the Ancient Mysteries and plunge the rest of the world into darkness.<br /><br />This is the main plot of The Lost Symbol, the third book in Dan Brown's saga about Professor Robert Langdon. The Lost Symbol is a change of subjects for the series. Brown has left behind the religious world of the previous two books and has instead entered the world of cutting edge science and the Masons. It's a refreshing change of subject matter from the previous two books.<br /><br />I felt that there was less emphasis on puzzles than in the previous books. The whole book was built upon one main object with a few puzzles and mysteries contained within it. The puzzles themselves had a lot more to do with symbology and science though and it was still very astonishing how Langdon was able to solve them.<br /><br />Also, the book seemed to have much bigger plot twists and changes. I won't go into details, but I loved how he can completely switch the tables on what you are thinking or slowly build up to a point where you almost know what's going to happen.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol doesn't stray too much from the way the other two books go. Puzzles, surprises, and action still fueled my need to finish this book. It does stray away from the religious subject matter and toward scientific advancement and conspiracy theories, but I like the different subject. The Lost Symbol is an amazing book and I recommend it to anyone.
B000LXQVA4|3.0|This jumper is great!<br />My son LOVES to jump and this is just what he needed.<br />The jumper is adjustable so you can adjust it for the age.  We have it set and just put a pillow under him so he bounces off of that.<br />My son is 6m old so the center area fits him very well.  he's big too - wears 9m+ clothes!<br /><br />This center has a lot of activities plus a little space to put small toys on.  I really like the back support and the sides as they're very soft.  He's not ready for a lot of the activities so we'll just have to see how he grows into them in the next few months.<br />He can't really manipulate anything around him yet, he picks up toys I put in front of him and trys to turn the clear balls but he's not ready for it yet.  The dangley butter fly is useless at this age since it just falls and for a 6m old &#34;out of site out of mind!&#34;<br />The elephant needs to be watched!  When it's turned make sure your child's fingers aren't there... it's a pinch hazard.  Why is this elephant backwards anyway!?<br /><br />I like that this jumper doesn't take up as much floor space (almost!) as a regular exersaucer.<br />So far we haven't added batteries too it since there's usually enough going on and new experiences.  Think we'll add batteries later!
0765348780|5.0|There are few true masters of epic fantasy series. George R.R. Martin is one of the more recent authors to manage to create an epic fantasy series, but the list includes the likes of J.R.R. Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings) and Robert Jordan (The Wheel of Time). I truly love the grand scale and details the authors put into creating such worlds and stories. Recently, I found my way to buying Steven Erikson's Gardens of the Moon and began the quest to read through The Malazan Book of the Fallen series, one of the most celebrated epic fantasy series of all time. Gardens of the Moon has set the stage for a series of epic proportions and, on its on, is one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon is the introductory book into the world of the Malazan Empire and Steven Erikson's amazing world. Similar to the Game of Thrones, Gardens of the Moon follows multiple storylines from multiple points of view. In one view, we follow the noble-born captain in the Malazan army, Ganoes Paran. In another, we follow the view of a young street thief named Crokus. While these two are the major characters in the book, Erikson also tells the story through other characters linked to Paran and Crokus. What is interesting about the book is how everything is connected. It is hard explaining this amazing fact without spoiling the story, but the sheer amount of thought needed to craft such a storyline is unthinkable and rivals that of the Game of the Thrones. In many ways, it surpasses it. The story is not as convoluted and vast as the political swamp that is the Game of Thrones, but it is just as suspenseful and unpredictable. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very end and you grow to know each and every character. On its own, the story is amazing, but it also seems to be just a snippet of what is to come.<br /><br />The world of the Malazan Empire is created with stunning detail. Cities, towns, physical landmarks, and multitudes of animals inhabit the world created by Brooks. If you look at the maps provided before the beginning of the book, you will see just how detailed of the world he has created. Different regions or even different places are populated by a diverse group of people, similar to the mass of cultures in real life. Each group of people have unique cultural aspects that are different from others groups that bring the level of reality of the world beyond what is found in many other books like it.<br /><br />One of the major aspects of the book is its inclusion of magic. Gardens of the Moon and The Malazan Book of the Fallen series have a completely unique take on the aspect of magic. Brooks has blended sorcery and religion into a complex web. This blending has created a unique system of gods and magic of unparalleled complexity that I have never experienced before. The system is very confusing to explain and I do not fully understand it. This is due to the fact that the book does not even attempt to explain the rules behind such a system. It just throws you into the middle of the chaotic relationships between the gods and mortals. This problem is the only real major fault of the book, yet I find it absolutely amazing. Not only does the book pull you in with its unpredictable plot, but it stirs the curiosity to learn more about the system of magic and gods. Some people will find this way to confusing and will not enjoy the book and I would not blame them, but stick with it, and you will begin to see patterns and some image of rules behind it.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon is a book unlike any other. The sheer vastness and detail of the world is enough tweak the curiosity of those looking for a challenge or looking to immerse themselves in another reality. The story is one of the most intriguing I have read so far, yet it still seems to be a snippet of a larger reality. Erikson has created the perfect book to capture readers everywhere and bring them into this amazing world.inhabit the world created by Brooks.

B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Having received this set only a few days ago, I have watched only the first three episodes on season 1, disk 1.  In general the image quality and sound are excellent.  I find, however, that the color is a bit garish and over-saturated.  I like the re-created external-scene graphics that have been criticized by others.  But the Blu-Ray disks have the option to show the original graphics, although I have not tried this.<br /><br />My main complaint is with the menu system used to select episodes.  Instead of having a pick-list of episodes, it is necessary to select a very-small right-arrow to move through the four episodes on the disk.

B00BSO2U1Y|3.0|I listened to this recording several times before attempting to review it.<br />NORMA is my favorite opera and this the 36th and newest version in my collection. I have heard the title role sung by artists as diverse as Rosa Ponselle (in excerpts only), Gina Cigna, Zinka Milanov, Maria Callas, Leyla Gencer, Joan Sutherland, Montserrat Caballe, Elinor Ross, Beverly Sills, Elena Suliotis, Anita Cerquetti, Renata Scotto, Grace Bumbry, Shirley Verrett, Ghena Dimitrova, Jane Eaglen, Edita Gruberova, Daniella Dessi, Nelly Miricioiu, Hasmik Papian, and Mariella Devia, so I do consider myself entitled to give an informed opinion.<br />I can only name 3 singers who have been great Normas. In chronological order they were Ponselle, Callas, and Caballe.<br />Regarding this latest recording, I must confess beforehand that I am not a fan of Cecilia Bartoli, having always considered her to be less of a stage performer and more of a concert artist, and a vulgar one at that, taking no risks and prone to mannerisms. Well, at the age of 46 she confounded the critics and finally sang Norma on stage, NOT in Italy, but in Salzburg. Was she afraid to sing the role in Italy, choosing a safer Germanic milieu instead? I will not comment on the horrendous 2010 Dortmund concert version and will await until the (modern staging) Salzburg performance becomes available on DVD or YouTube to pass judgment on that.<br />This recording is supposed to treat the operatic score &#34;come scritto&#34; and as it must have sounded in Bellini's time, with relatively smaller voices and orchestral sound on period instruments (ie of slightly lower pitch).<br />Much of it is admirable, even beautifully performed. The Scintilla Orchestra really shines with brilliance and accuracy under Giovanni Antonini, but some passages sound too fast and he should have let the music breathe more.<br />Michele Pertusi has just the right amount of vocal heft for Oroveso. In the past we have heard baritonal tenors with honking bronze voices as Pollione (del Monaco, Corelli, Domingo, even Vickers) and in John Osborn we have a light lyric, almost Rossinian tenor. It is a good portrayal, even if the voice sounds impersonal and the diction occasionally suffers. One wonders what Joseph Calleja, Gregory Kunde or even Juan Diego Florez would have done with this role.<br />The role of Adalgisa is here delegated to a soprano. This is nothing new, one can refer to Eva Mei, Mirella Freni (on disc) and even Montserrat Caballe (the 1984 Decca recording with Joan Sutherland) in the past. Well as Sumi Jo may sing Adalgisa's music, her portrayal is so faceless, her vocal color so ordinary, that neither the character's ardor nor her youth come across as credible.<br />And then we have Cecilia Bartoli. One must first of all admire her tenacity, stamina, diligence and sheer guts in undertaking what the French call &#34;le role des roles&#34;. I have seen Bartoli both in concert and on stage. She has an expressive voice and virtuoso technique, but I regard her as a flamboyant performer who likes to show off, whose art never matured, and who resorts to exaggerated rolled rrrrs, yodelling trills and little sighing, giggling mannerisms.<br />It is evident that she worked long and hard on Norma and luckily we have very little of the above. The voice is not large but expressive throughout its considerable range, the phrasing accurate and elegant. Some of the vindictive, tigress-like outbursts impress, but one wonders whether they sound convincing because she is singing 10cm from the microphone and if they would be the same on a large stage. One also wishes she would follow performing tradition and prolong some iconic moments like the confession of her guilt in &#34;Son io&#34; or the exposed high C on &#34;Sangue Roman&#34; (where Callas famously cracked in Paris in 1964) , which add infinite dramatic credibility to the role.<br />She delivers many passages beautifully; &#34;Casta Diva&#34;, sung softly, with longbreath control, an added cadenza and variations in the second stanza, is lovely. The trio which concludes Act I is brilliant with its threatening phrases repeated and embellished. The &#34;Mira o Norma&#34; duet is admirable. I found her two best moments in the final scene, a &#34;Qual cor tradisti&#34; duet which is a lesson in lyrical emotive singing and a final plea in &#34;Deh non volerli vittime&#34; which is simply heart-rending.<br />BUT my main objection is to her overall portrayal, which is wrong, totally wrong. She gives us Anna Magnani instead of Norma, we hear a jilted Neapolitan bourgeoise instead of the divine Gallic priestess. The atrocious photographs of a black-clad, dishevelled Bartoli on the recording's cover and in the Notes show a village woman who is the object of adulterous vendetta on a Greek island (Bartoli's album photos have always been of execrable taste, think the embarrassing Sonnambula and Sacrificium artwork!). This downgraded interpretation becomes clearly audible in a horribly paced, blandly sung &#34;In mia man alfin tu sei&#34;, which happens to be my favorite part of the work. What we hear is a &#34;cornuta&#34; housewife hen-pecking her errant husband. No, this is NOT Norma. Listen to this performance, then refer directly to Maria Callas and Mario del Monaco at La Scala in 1955 to understand how this magnificent duet should sound! One has simply to read the Italian libretto to remind oneself that Vincenzo Bellini clearly did not intend his heroine to be incarnated the way Bartoli has: the priests describe Rome's star covering itself as Norma approaches, Adalgisa fears her &#34;Celeste austerita&#34;, to Pollione she is a &#34;Sublime donna&#34;! This is no ordinary human role for any singer to undertake but an impossible, often unattainable, operatic challenge. There are clear indications why Norma is considered the pinnacle of Italian soprano roles and I regret to say that the worthy Cecilia has disregarded them.<br />In conclusion, by all means do buy this version and listen to it for an &#34;authentic&#34; musicological interpretation and some beautiful singing. But for a real portrayal of Norma please allow me to go back to Callas and Caballe (no, not Sutherland) in their respective primes.breath control, an added cadenza and variations in the second stanza, is lovely.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|Well, that was a surprise. So I give credit for the choice, I just have a couple of problems with it that involve consistency vs shock value but the reality is that I really didn't want that to happen because it makes me sad! And I get how subjective and whiny that is but man, I feel like I kind if wasted my investment in these books now. But I still have to give credit to Roth for making me invested in the first place even though I'm now mad at her. It's very frustrating. I might need a hug.

B000MV9026|4.0|When I let my children preview a recently produced movie, it is usually because I have investigated and read other's reviews on the film beforehand.  This was one of the times where I did not (my 5 year old picked it up at the store and wouldn't put it down, as she LOVES penguins AND dancing) and I'm sorry that I didn't.  The 'legalistic' reviews really could have shed some much needed light on why the film was PG rated (sexual innuendos, some of the songs were sexual with minimal lyrics being changed for the movie, the agenda of making the patriarch Penguins seem wrong/one sided, etc).<br /><br />My children are 9,8 and 5 years, respectively.  The opening dance number was a hit with all of them.  They laughed their heads off and danced up a storm for the first 20 minutes of the film.  After 40 minutes, though, they slowly disengaged and left the room to do other things (board games, legos, trampoline, etc).  I watched it and tried to decipher if I really liked it or did not.  I decided that I liked the dance/happy theme of the movie.  I did not like the sexualization of the penguins bodies, walks, and talk.  I did not like the choice of most of the songs that were R&B, Pop, and Rap.  I DID like the oldies songs and the peppy updates of them.  I did not like the underlying theme of going against ones culture and upbringing, but this is because I was thinking that if one looked too deep into this (probably not children, though) that it seemed there was a spirit of walking away from your father and mother's GOOD and moral values, maybe even religious values - the things that are right and good in one's family and culture.  I'm not 100% sure that that was what the movie was trying to provoke, but I felt it a bit despite trying to keep an open mind.  Now if I were just to take it at face value, of course, I loved that Mumble was different and I thoroughly enjoyed the dancing ADDED to the singing.  I loved the dancing part immensely.  If I could movie the shop the movieand just have my kids/me watch the dancing and a few singing bits of the movie, this would be played our DVD player on a regular basis.  I can't do this, so this movie will probably go to Goodwill.....but only after Daddy views it with us to make the final call.
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|Yes, I'm one of those &#34;long-time NIN fans...&#34;<br /><br />BUT, I really wanted to like this album.  When I was hearing the tracks he was releasing before the album came out, I was really disappointed at first.  People kept making comparisons to The Downward Spiral and saying things like, &#34;Trent's BACK!&#34; but I just wasn't hearing it and became pretty embittered toward the album, canceled me pre-order, etc...  Then I came back, listened to the pre-release tracks some more and realized I should give it the opportunity to grow on me.  I resubmitted my pre-order and downloaded the MP3's the day of release then listened to it for a few days... and that was about it.  Honestly, as much as I tried to get into it, I just couldn't.  It's not that the music is terrible or anything, it's just not something I find myself craving to listen to.  Sometimes I remember that I have it and give it another try, but find it to be as lackluster as I remembered it.  I've found that it makes good background music for when I'm playing games or something, but I just don't find it interesting enough to do any focused listening.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this headset for my teenage son. I had purchased less expensive headsets in the past for him that he claimed were low in quality. It's been two days of use for him and he's very satisfied with the sound quality of the Mic, the surround sound and the ease of use. The folks he plays online games with notice the difference and quality of his voice during games. I'm glad I found an affordable headset that met his expectations.
1476727651|5.0|This is Stephen King at his spell-binding best. Hard to put down. The 'bad people's' point of view almost elicits the reader's sympathy because it is so well and so convincingly portrayed. This is better then The Shining, to which it is a sort of sequel. By all means read The Shining again but do nor watch the movie.
B00G70JQZC|5.0|I love wolverine so buying this movie was a real no brainer.  My husband and I collect all the comic book hero movies.  But Wolverine is my favorite.  His struggle to reconcile past atrocities performed on him and the incredible power he has, as a result, is a difficult emotionally draining process for him.  Compounded with the loss of Jean (aka Phoenix) and the guilt he feels for his role in her death he has surmised that life is not really worth living.  Isolated in self-proclaimed exile he spends his days, and nights, reliving her death.  He believes death will free him from all pain.  You know what they say about getting what you wish for?  Wolverine will have plenty of time to ponder the answer to that question when he is jerked back into the present world to fulfill an old friend's last request.  We are also introduced to another Mutant.  Hugh Jackman is at his acting best and most physically &#34;ripped&#34; Wolverine ever.
B00634GHJA|5.0|It works, and quite well at that.  It's easy to use, fairly intuitive, and much nicer than getting kicked in the shins repeatedly by an ill-tempered toddler.

I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I thought the special effects, creature, background for Earth could have been better.  Still I enjoyed it very much. Mi would recommend seeing it.  The relationship dynamic between father and son is intriguing.  Growing up quickly and overcoming fear to survive was well played by Jayden.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a selection for a book club I'm in and at first I didn't think I would enjoy it.  I was wrong.  It was one of those books you don't want to put down.  I loved it!
B003JH8LPW|3.0|This was a good read and although I finished it it was not quite as good as other San Brown books.I found myself wandering from time to time, then re-reading the last page just to remember where I was...
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|You cannot beat this mouse when it comes to price per features. It is a great beginners gaming mouse, or if you don't want to spend $60+ on a gaming mouse
B00421IR5I|5.0|This is a French movie, so if you can't understand French, you're still in luck! There are English subtitles.<br /><br />In any event, this movie was very cute, lighthearted and just an all-around fun family-friendly comedy. I won't tell you what it's about because you can read that for yourself, but I will say that the acting was A++, the plot was adorable and the humorous moments really were quite funny.<br /><br />I am minoring in French, and we watched this movie in French class just before Thanksgiving break 2013. I immediately purchased it, I loved it that much! So if you are studying the French language, this will make a great edition to your French film library.
B008NW67E0|3.0|Saw them on an awards show and was blown away.  Was eager to get there music.  After listening to it a few times the disc was peppered with a little too mutch religion for my taste.  I then discovered that they were a christian band before going mane stream.  Musically it great but as for the lyrics...not for me.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I wasn't sure when I downloaded this book that I hadn't read it already.  The more I got into it, the more familiar it became. This book is so well written, I just had to finish it, again! And I loved it again as well. I also read the second book. I love this author!
B000UGZTQO|4.0|Lost my original piece in a river and had to replace it.  It works just like the original and am pleased with the purchase
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Being a submissive myself I wasn't sure I would like it---but it's pretty true to form. The anguish of a new relationship and the growing pains that accompany it.
0805092447|5.0|My two year old loves this book!  He wants to read it over and over again. The book is great for working on color recognition and animals. I definitely recommend this book for toddlers.
B00DCVCXTK|5.0|It's BUDDY GUY.  The album is great and Mr. Guy and Mr. Hambridge have put together three winners in a row. I highly recommend seeing Buddy Guy perform live. You will never forget it.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is amazing! Please come out with another soon. It has great combat mechanics and great graphics. Also who doesn't like to kick butt as your favorite superheroes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love love love love this game... it is so much fun.I played it for over about when I first got it. I made all of my friends get it.You need to get game...it rocks!!!!!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This book is not original, an unlikely hero coming from a family that hates him. He runs away from home and using some unknown power he kills a fearsome lion. A mysterious stranger appears and gives him advice. He befriend the prince and falls in love with the proncess. The character is near perfect and to give him a challenge the author takes away his powers for a moment so he is killing a giant lion one second but is struggling with training. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention  he has been chosen by the greatest knight of the realm to be his squire. However I am able to ignore this so it was quite an enjoyabe read. There is plenty of action. The training seemed a little wax on wax off but other than that it is quite well done. The chracters are enjoyable with quite  a range of personalities. Some are all about honor and duty, others scheming,devious and very unpleasent,and there are plenty tht are in between. I would recomend this book if you can handle some of its worse qualities.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you like the music of the Beatles this is a fun and thoughtful interpretation of their songs. It has a talented cast and the actress who plays the landlord/lead singer in the band has an incredible voice. The movie takes place in the 60's during the Viet Nam war so there's some psychedelic scenes, peace and love, flower children, etc. but it's mainly a love story. If you're old enough to remember the lyrics to the songs featured you'll probably be singing along.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Worked as intended. Got it for Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. Doesn't work for every game, but it works for the one i bought it for.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Good game! Easy to play and a good time waster. Worth your time folks ! Got it the other day on my Kindle.. Good times
B004DSDAE8|5.0|Fits perfect on the new natural bottles and niplles. Realy seals the bottle, does not matter the side you use it.<br />Great to store breast milk on the fridge, just were you are going to use it. Avoiding manipulation of the milk. Also great to transport the milk or tolher liquids.<br />And after, you can use it to store baby food.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game is AWSOME!!! It's.hard to get far, but that's the fun of it!! U can get 20+ suits, which is cool!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Does the job as advertised. However not as easy to set up as Google claimed. A USB cable (provided) needs to be connected to the TV. However, once set up works well.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|Love the entire franchise, cant wait for what's next.  The best thing to have ever happened to Marvel is Disney.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The writing is amazing and the actors make you like them even when they are being jerks.  What more can you want from TV?  :-)
B004US4K2C|1.0|GO Launcher used to be amazing. You used to be able to hide apps that you never use or that come stock on your device but you can't uninstall them. I had to factory reset my phone and reinstall this and ever since then Go Launcher EX keeps force closing, and crashing my phone in the middle of the night while it is charging... Such a shame, this app used to be so amazing. Then they started asking for coins for you to buy and use for themes that used to be free ( and are still advertised as free in Google Play).
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is crazy addicting. You have officially been warned. once you start playing it, you have to keep going. This game if fun for all. Unless you don't have thumbs, then that would suck.
0307476464|2.0|I usually read at least some reviews before purchasing a book.  In this case, although I resisted tackling an 1157 page book that would usurp otherwise precious reading time, I dove in, based on the recommendations of one of the most well-read people I know.  It only goes to show you, there's no accounting for tastes.  Like others, I found this book extremely painful to finish.  It was boring, redundant, poorly edited, and in spite of it's length, seemed unfinished.  Way too much time was spent on repetition and stupid details.  Although I have an ignoramus's understanding of quantum physics, linear, or chaos theory, or &#34;other-worldliness&#34;, I have a great appreciation for the concepts and anyone's attempts to get me to understand them just a little bit more.  Maybe I was looking for something that didn't exist here.  This book lacked any measure of anything except a comic book version of some fantastical world that I didn't really give a hoot about.  The characters were overly glorified, while lacking any real depth, except some sophomoric concept of whatever they believed in.  I'm trying to get smarter in my old age.  Not waste my time on nonsense.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Where do I even begin with this book? Well I spose I should start off by saying that I will be talking about spoilers in this review. There is no may about it. Its a bit hard to talk about it without spoilers.<br /><br />The pace of this book seems to move slowly despite all the stuff that is going on but then it all seems to just collapse at the end when it turns out it wasn’t really all that slow. Sorry I know that doesn’t make much sense, but this book rocked me and I find it hard to think all that clearly. Also, some of the actions that happen in this book are just a tad ridiculous. Though things they have to face and things that happen are believable in the sense that the world they are in is ridiculous so that kind of stuff can happen, but it still seems really over the top and just mad. I kind of don’t think they are going to be able to pull this book off as a movie very well. Sure they can make it all digital and what not but it still might not work. I spose I will see in over a year when the last movie comes out.<br /><br />Some other plot things that annoyed me were:<br /><br />1. I thought the districts were won over a tad too easily before they started taking on the capital.<br /><br />2. No one by the end of the book really gives a toss about them winning the war. Its mentioned but there is no emotion in it really.<br /><br />This book is desperately throughout the entire thing. Its so sad even that I actually hated any happy parts. They were a tease and just made things harder to deal with. Everyone dies in this book. If they didn’t die in a physical way they all die emotionally.<br /><br />Katniss starts off kind of weak and pathetic and by the end she is basically a shell. This kills me and yet I find believable so is very well done because she was just a strong person and it was heart breaking to see her die that way. I totally hated Peeta for how he was after they saved him. I know it wasn’t all his fault with the torture and how they made it all connect to Katniss so he hated her, but I still hated him. Its not realistic of me to think he could withstand things like that but I did. It took him far too long to come back around and even then he wasn’t the same. I think part of me needed him to stay the way he was before because Katniss just couldn’t. I wanted to like Haymitch. I did. But I couldn’t forgive him for stuff that happened in the other book. I hated Gale too by the end. Parts of his personality that now that I think back through the other books that have always been there but were not dominant are horrible. He was filled with too much hatred. I also hate him for his part in the final events no matter how small.<br /><br />On a plus side the love triangle is resolved. But this too is depressing. Gale and Katniss don’t end up together because he played a part and designed the trap that killed Prim. Thats right, the whole reason Katniss joined the games to begin with, to keep her sister alive, was totally for nothing because she was killed as a result of her oldest friend’s actions. I was in shock over this for a really long time, and it didn’t really hit me that she was dead until Katniss started screaming at Prim’s cat telling it that she was never coming back. I cried my eyes out at that part.<br /><br />The author tried to give the book a kind of happy ending, but it felt hollow. I had to go get in the shower once I finished the book. I was so emotionally stuffed up and broken that I felt dirty all over and I had to try and wash it off. So yeah, great book in a really depressing way. I would recommend it.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Love the app. It works on my iPad, Galaxy 3 and PC. Unfortunately, it refuses to run on my new Samsung Tab 3. Had uninstall it.<br />So for that reason, it sucks.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I think thks game is great for improving memory in old people. KEEP MAKIMG NEW GAMES OR IMPROVING THIS ONE.
B00EVLU2F2|3.0|The snippets I heard before the album was released ended up being the best sounding parts on the project.<br />Listened to it for awhile when I first downloaded it but haven't touched it since.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|The show itself is good with its ups and downs, but I am here to say the 3D is mind blowingly good.<br />Definitely up there with the best live action 3D I have ever seen. Being Blu Ray this should be even better than what I saw.<br />But the resolution was fantastic. The imagery was highly dimensional and I can't even imagine watching this episode in 2D.<br />You wouldn't be seeing a world in a painting. It would be like a black and white picture telling you how colorful a painting is.<br />Everything about it is first rate at least for the first forty minutes. Then a little  less attention gets paid to the 3D aspect.<br /><br />I hope this spurs more 3D broadcasts because it was such a great experience.  3D on televisions is so well done and yet there is so little content readily available to customers who own 3D capable sets.  Hopefully Netflix will get this one soon so more people will have access.  (Netflix is one of the only streaming service providing some 3D content)  Almost a must have for fans of the Doctor and 3D.
B00GIZO674|5.0|I can't stop playing Burger Shop.  I absolutely love Burger Shop 2.  When is Burger Shop 2 and Cake Shop 2 coming to kindle?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read most of the Grisham novels over these past many years, and this is without question, one of the best.<br />The Grisham novels in recent years have seemed just so-so, but I think with this one he is back on track. Strongly recommend this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is a great app unless you get frustrated easily. I enjoy trying to beat all the levels and I'm trying to get to minion beach. please gt this app because it is one of the best free apps I have ever played. :)
B00F2HW1YY|5.0|Wow, what a fantastic album! Been a Flower Kings fan for close to 10 years and have pretty much all albums, DVD's, solo projects, etc. The last 3 or 4 albums did not really click for me (none since A&E), so I somewhat reluctantly purchased this thinking it would be similar. First listen or two of DR and I was thinking the same, and then on the 5th or 6th play it all came together. Pretty much every track on side one is excellent, and a couple of the bonus tracks (i.e., Interstellar Visitations) are outstanding as well. So psyched that these guys are still together putting out music like this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a picture person.  I enjoy seeing many different places, all kinds of nature pictures, crafts, jewelry and more
1401224806|3.0|Bigby Wolf (that's the Big Bad Wolf, who's a bit of a reformed character in the Fables universe) is out looking for a new location to move the fairy tale creatures from Fabletown. He goes to Story City, Iowa, which is fairly isolated from other towns. He soon discovers it's been taken over by werewolves. An old friend from World War II runs the town by keeping the various factions in balance, which is tough since they all have heightened animal instincts.<br /><br />The back story of the town (which ties into Bigby's back story) is interesting. Bigby is an American and was fighting behind enemy lines trying to disrupt the enemy during World War II. His big problem was the lack of military intelligence, i.e. he never knew which targets to hit because he didn't know their value. During one raid, he runs across Sergeant Arthur Harp who has just the information he needs. They work together for a while. At the end of their partnership, they go to Frankenstein's Castle (yeah, that Frankenstein). The Nazis are trying to recreate Frankenstein's monster (actually a whole bunch of them) to fight as supersoldiers. The Nazis capture Bigby and Harp is accidentally infected with Bigby's blood during the fighting. The castle is blown to bits with Harp inside. Bigby assumed he died because he didn't know Harp had become a werewolf. Fast forward 60 years and now Harp has a town full of werewolves who are trying to live peaceably by themselves.<br /><br />Now that Bigby is there, most of the townfolk take him for a god, since he is their progenitor. Some expect him to provide miracles or leadership. Harp sees trouble as does Bigby. Things go from bad to worse in a hurry.<br /><br />I found the set-up of the story interesting and Bigby is a complicated protagonist. The story seems a bit like Yojimbo or A Fistful of Dollars, where a loner drifts into town and mayhem ensues. It's not nearly as good as those films, though, since the action is more bloody and violent than smart. The wolves make some plans, but they are very basic plans without much cunning. The action is exciting enough but not spectacular. I wanted a little more depth to the story or interest in the rest of the characters.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: In addition to lots of bloody violence (including decapitations and missing limbs), there's also a lot of nudity (I guess the werewolves don't want to ruin their clothes) and one fairly graphic seduction scene with nudity. This is not a comic for kids.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|this book was so addicting. couldnt put it down! loved every minute of it. better than the movie by far!
B009AMANBA|4.0|Despite the title, this movie is not a bio-pic about American president Abraham Lincoln. Rather, it tells the story of his fight in late 1864 and early 1865 to pass the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that abolished slavery in the United States. The story is dramatically told with the typical Spielberg visual flair.<br /><br />Even though the film is not a bio-pic, it gives a fully-rounded character portrait of Lincoln. We see him as a father comforting his young son and trying to keep his older son out of combat. We see the turbulent relationship with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln (ably played by Sally Field). He deals with congressmen, soldiers (high and low ranked), government workers, and everyday people. Lincoln often uses his penchant for storytelling to make his points. He's decisive and forceful when he needs to be. He is politically adept, which often means skirting on the edges of (if not crossing over) what's moral to achieve his ends. Viewers see his lawyerly mind working all the different facets of legal issues, especially when he discusses (though really it is a monologue) the legality and the impact of the Emancipation Proclamation. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a great performance, capturing the voice and look and world-weariness and optimism of Lincoln. So perhaps the title is justified.<br /><br />The political and moral wrangling over the amendment is interesting. Many different factions in the House of Representatives need to be satisfied--hard-lining abolitionists and Southern sympathizers and middle-grounders. Lincoln's staff works with sympathetic congressmen to make sure they don't push so hard they make it impossible for others to join the cause. They hire some men to offer patronage to wavering congressmen to secure their votes. When patronage doesn't work, blackmail is also tried. Meanwhile, a delegation from the Confederate government is invited to negotiate peace (thus placating those hoping that a diplomatic solution has been tried beforethe amendment is passed) but Lincoln struggles with accepting their potential offer (which would kill momentum for the amendment but end the war) and his desire to pass the amendment (which would end the evil of slavery but kill the peace negotiations). The movie gives plenty of food for thought on the right way to handle such situations and the need for compromise and chicanery in politics.<br /><br />Check out more commentary on A Good Story Is Hard to Find podcast which is what inspired me to watch.
B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|Another remix package from Verve Records (fresh from the First Ladies Remixed). Actually it is not too bad. Leave aside the new song which does not fit in this CD & please give us the extended versions. Remixes from Masters at Work, Frankie Knuckles, Hot Chip are not to be missed. Perhaps those who prefer the classic remixes can go for the 12\\" Dance Collection. Just slip this in your deck & give it another try.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzane Collins in this second book is able to still hold the attention of the reader and you go on wanting more and more!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This is a really good doctors offies game to wase time while you wait for your apointment... I think you will like it
B00D8CSVLW|3.0|Although a good plot, it drags in places. not the usual Grisham. The end too looks abrupt and not tightly written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pocket edition is a great game but could use more updates like wolfs (new animals)  more blocks,  night time in  creative and so so.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Very difficult to set up. Very vague instructions. I spent almost 3 hours screwing around with trying to get it to work. You just go in circles. What ever happened to PLUG'N'PLAY?<br /><br />Also Amazon reduces the price from $35.00 to $29.99 but doesn't offer an Amazon credit or refund for the difference to the poor suckers who paid $35.00 for it only a few days before it was reduced. Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />And they have the nerve to charge $3.99 to return the piece of junk.<br /><br />I think I will shop my local computer and electronic stores from now on. They believe in customer service. Amazon doesn't!
B00F2362IE|5.0|Pizza is delicious in this game.  There is a lot of fighting and most importantly pizza. I like the graphics it looks realistic. If I were you, I would get my tablet and get this game right now. Trust me
B000ID1J40|5.0|Try and match a cast this awesome to any other movie! Action-packed (without guns & explosions) & hilarious. One of my top all-time favorite movies I can watch over & over & never get tired of it!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Very good period drama about the juxtaposition of the upstairs (wealthy) versus the downstairs (servants) and their respective daily lives and adventures. You quickly fall in love with the characters and the way things were in early 1900's. Fun to watch and well done.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This thing works great.  I have never been a headset fan as they always feel like they are about to fall off.  This one seems to fit and is both loud enough and has enough range that I can walk around while talking.  I do occasionally need to re-pair the headset with my MacBook Air or iPhone but its not a big deal.  I haven't been able to pair it with my Dell computer at work, what more can I say, I'd rather use my MacBook.  The case that charges the phone is the best, I travel a lot and never have to worry about a low battery plus it protects the headset.
B00F2362IE|2.0|Looks to be a fun game for my son since he loves the turtles.  Unfortunately he spends more time watching the loading symbol than playing. Please fix.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Just as describes and the quality is good.  As a warning it takes two hands for my wife the snap the Maglite flashlight in to just one bracket so we are only using one per flashlight.  I'm not sure she could pop it in if we were using two brackets per flashlight.
B00AEFYXD6|5.0|The story has a nice plot that kids can follow. The characters are interesting & the color is bright. My grandsons love it.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|It may be a little known secret but your MacBook Air (at least) will function as a wireless base station if you use this to connect to the internet.  This is a great feature for people who travel.  I use this in my hotel room or in temporary offices or conference rooms to share a single internet connection.  To date I've never seen a PC that will do the same thing.  At times I've had 6 or 7 people sharing my internet connection, iPads, iPhones other Macs and PC's, works great.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so much fun. You can interact with your friends and more with the equestria  girls.I really think it's great for kids.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is amasing. It is so addictive  but so much fun! Upgrade your veichle and more! On  thing I would like is to have the drivers point of view instead of third person. Thanks!
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I remember enjoying the first book so when my \\"to read list\\" ran out I decided to give this book a try. It has a good structure and solid characters, but as the book went on I found a few things where bothering me. First, I could tell exactly where the book was headed. And then America had absolutely no backbone, along with every other female character in the book. For being a futuristic story, this book was from the 50's. The women are in the kitchen, the men are at work.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This series is probably one of the best I have ever read! I couldn't put it down! A must read for everyone!
1401924751|4.0|these cards are fun and accurate, however at times I get the same cards over and over so it loses its funness. but over all a cute toy to play with.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|As it turns out the Hunger Games was not berry good for the empire as Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has inspired hope and rebellion. Instead of just killing her, they have changed the rules ( see Jonathan &#34;Roller Ball&#34;) and devised a new Hunger Game of past contestants. The game is stacked against her as contestants must battle the elements more than each other.<br /><br />The beginning of the film lacks the crazy action of the second half, but it is theme driven for the true sci-fi fan. Katniss is a hero, but as she says, &#34;By killing people.&#34; In those 3 simple words. Katniss who suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, conveys the perplexity of war heroes with a moral conscience. The film also touches on the power of celebrity as they &#34;never get off this train: and the trouble they cause if the don't &#34;stick to the script.&#34; The culture is set up similar to the Roman Empire where bread and circus' s keep the masses in check and where Romans &#34;Eat to puke and puke to eat.&#34; Katniss, is a hero because her compassion expresses in all of us the person we want to be. As such it is easy for her to gain allies.<br /><br />The film contains all the elements of an ideal cult classic complete with theme, special effects, drama, top stars, and a touch of light humor.<br /><br />I do not recommend watching this film if you haven't seen the first one (or read the books) as it doesn't recap.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|One of my all time favorite books.  An interesting perspective of Richard Feynman which is filled with humor and keeps you smiling.  A must have book for your library.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|There is no.thing I can say other than to read this book. It is the best thing I ever have or either will buy on Black Friday.
B003XRELEI|5.0|Vonnegut is not perfect, but he has an ability to illuminate the absurdities of life and the basic failings of society like no other author I have ever encountered.  Breakfast of Champions has less of the &#34;sci-fi&#34; element than some of his other works and scrapes more off the gritty underbelly of the American Tragedy than usual as Kilgore Trout is propelled across America to meet his maker and Dwayne Hoover faces inevitable insanity.  Vonnegut seems to be pushing the limits of good taste, and yet does so with such light-hearted wit (and many drawings) that if you find it offensive, chances are you don't understand how perversely prudish, ignorant and deluded we are as a society and how much we need writers like Vonnegut today to shout &#34;Open your eyes!&#34;
B0014NDXGA|3.0|Disappointed... This must have been a floor model... Battery case/cap was beat up, like someone had tried to tighten the cap... made me a little doubtful of the product...  but it works fine.... of all my Amazon products, it is just not the one I am the happiest with....  check it out before accepting.  I should have been more responsible and reported this earlier...  time escapes me just like everyone else....
0756405890|5.0|The Best and most original fantasy tale I have read in years. Great character development and mood. I am expecting greater things to come from Mr Rothfuss.
B00B7FOQCK|2.0|I received it in the mail and had a difficult time to plug in some usb devices onto some ports, seems like it's too &#34;tight&#34; for it and I have to &#34;jam&#34; it in. Some of them don't fit. Does anyone have similar problems?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What a read!<br />No wonder it's going to be a movie.<br />I laughed and a cried, I don't know what else to,say, just fantastic!
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Twists and turns unexpected.  Some slow spots, but interesting and challenging for the most part.  One of the better classics I have read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Sorry but I'm not quite finished with Wool Omnibus.  But I'm absolutely hooked on this series.  In fact I have already installed the next installment in my Kindle so I won't go a second without reading about this additive story.  At first it started out slow and I had a hard time finding out what was going on.  But stick with it and you won't be disappointed, I sure wasn't . I don't get as much opportunities to sit down and read and it drives me nuts.  I can hardly wait to read the next installment on how this silo society got started.  I would highly recommended this series.
B00BWTJ2WU|5.0|Not a bad song on this album - Great listening all the way through.  My favorites are Gypsy Heart and Face of Light.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I particularly like the combination of cello and piano, and the arrangements to the carols add to them and their message.

B00EI4V3X2|4.0|Note that I've used the headphones only for movies, not for gaming or for two way communication.<br /><br />Turtle Beach's Ear Force is an ideal head phone set for watching movies and TV quietly.  I have a simple home theater set up and enjoy the sound.  These headphones allow me to get about 90% of the &#34;liveliness&#34; of the home theater's sound without disturbing others.  I've had several other headphones, both wireless and hard-wired, but these beat the others in terms of audio quality and equal the others in terms of comfort.<br /><br />Pros-<br />-Well built,<br />-Easy to set up and use<br />-GREAT sound quality<br />-Very comfortable<br />-Relatively little sound leakage (so as to not disturb others close by)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Build quality not at the $150 level
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved it. I loved the plot twist and the cunning metaphors in this book. It's not dramatic but it's realistic and it makes you wonder about what are you going to do with your life. I would recommended this book to anyone who was experienced a loss or a time where they felt hopeless but somehow,got back up again. 5 star all the way
B004SEUIXS|4.0|I had heard of this movie for a long time, and now I've watched it. It was good, for me not great, but good.
0141000198|4.0|I rarely read books if I've seen the movie already, but this one was so much fun, and strangely empowering. I don't read too many self-help books, but I totally understand how Bridget gets tied up between different schools of thoughts in self-help.<br /><br />So enjoyable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Took me about 50 pages to start liking it, then I FELL IN LOVE with this book. So much truth and insight into human nature in this book. Beautifully and smartly written. Some people are griping about the end--phooey. I'm griping that the story HAD TO END. Can't wait to read Flynn's other novels now.
0525478817|4.0|An Imperial Affliction is a novel written by Peter van Houten, and that fictitious novel is a centerpiece in this one. Hazel, a young woman with cancer, reads this book very frequently, because the main character has cancer and it is portrayed in a way that she identifies with.<br /><br />When she tells her new friend Augustus about this book that is almost a part of her, he also feels strongly about it, and the two hatch a plan to discover what the author believes happened to the characters after the end of the novel.<br /><br />I'm really not doing this book justice, but I really enjoyed the role of An Imperial Affliction in The Fault in Our Stars. I recommend.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My daughter needed to read this for her 5th grade book club. She has really enjoyed the book and shared many highlights with me. It seems very appropriate for her age group and has a good message.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought this movie did a very good job presenting the subject matter of the book.  It was not as violent and gory as it could have been and did (necessarily, probably for the sake of time) leave out several scenes that I remember from the book.  It did, however, present the idea of the games very well, and the main characters were perfectly cast.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This is one I'd never even heard of and found while browsing Prime movies.  What a find, this is one that keeps you engaged, Nick Nolte is so good in this role.
B00004TXFX|5.0|Awesome performance from my favorite band! Love Jerry's hoedown, and Layne's little screw up in the beginning of 'Sludge Factory'.  LSMS Forever
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun. Hi. Woo, goo. Yay, nice games are amazing to play, wish that there was a second version, now.
0938045695|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS ON KETTLEBELL TRAINING. HAS A LOT OF PROPAGANDA IN IT BUT THATS A RUSSIAN FOR YOU. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, GET IT
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|its fun hunting, I like the slow motion and the realism and many nice guns... I'm happy because ive haven't found such a good simulator like this better than big game hunter cabelas suck compare to this game
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great app!! I just started, but love it so far! Don't like how I need more than just money to expand.
0763644765|4.0|I'm not sure why, but my 28 month old loves this book. I'm hoping it will help prep him for potty training.  We don't have a cat or dog, so the pages where the baby wonders what the pets do to go potty are confusing.
B00FMJJ064|5.0|Talented and beautiful artist. Simply amazing. Don't usually review things, but Lindsey is definitely worth giving props to. Can't wait to see what she does next.
0345529057|5.0|I was so happy to find this in a set together at a reasonable price. the quality of the books is good.
1401938906|3.0|I liked the book, but to be honest none of the experiments worked for me except for one...the one with the coat hanger wands...everything else did not manifest. But I guess it might just be that I don't have a strong enough faith or something, other people are writing reviews saying how they all worked! Maybe I'll try again.
B00ERIUO1G|5.0|I knew after hearing some of her later songs, I knew she was growing up past the rebellious preacher's daughter into the mature songwriter who could write about real life rather than about every topic she could find that might have shock value for her conservative upbringing.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to regret getting this app but I dont now!!!! The *primary* reason for rating it only 4 out of 5 stars
0802473156|5.0|I love this book. It has really helped us with our communication and help us understand eachpther in a whole new way. We went and saw a marriage counselor and she suggested that we both buy this book and try some of the exercises talked about in this book. Unfortunately we didn't listen and 6 months later when our marriage was at its lowest point and I had decided to move out I thought about this book. I went online and read a lot of great reviews. I didn't think it could help as much as people on the reviews had said but I figured I had nothing to lose. I sent a book to my husband and purchased one for myself. I read and read and started to understand so many things that I had wondered about for years. My husband also started to read it and it really helped our communication. It helped us communicate to eachpther what each of us needs and we cut back the arguing drastically. I really recommend this book to anyone, wether you're going through a rough patch, looking to make things better or even if things are going great. There's so much great things to take from this book. I have recommended it to four of my friends already and a few of them already purchased a copy. They aren't married but I figure the things that are spoken about are helpful to romantic relationships in general and so far they think so too.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I took away two stars because the book dragged on for too long. Compared to book one and two, there wasn't nearly the amount if action like the other books. But, I am happy to complete this exciting trilogy.
3551551677|4.0|Ich spreche deutsch<br />And english it's about 80% right<br />In English translation<br />Amazon is better then barns and noble cause you can get different<br />Languge  on it
B004LWZW4M|5.0|A great remake I thought ...and the ending allows for a continuation...The Planet Of The Ape movies are one of favorites of all time.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love it! Every song on this album is great and gets you in the Christmas spirit! Great Christmas gift for any age!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I enjoy using it as a journal when my hand and fingers cramp up from using a pen. I like the fact you can use a password to keep people from reading your personal information. I love the calendar because I mark all my personal dates in there. And you can pick your background color for your note that your writing and the theme can either be black or white and I like that. So if your journaling each month can be a different color, which is pretty cool
B000GPIPSS|3.0|the movie and extras themselves are great. the &#34;special&#34; case it's in arrived broken so it's difficult to close after putting the dvd's back into it.
B00BHNR1KQ|1.0|Disgusting gratuitous sickeningly violent. Got a refund. Stopped watching after fifteen minutes. I do not recommend this movie at all.
0385537131|5.0|This is a a typical Grisham book. Well-written and highly suspenseful. I am having a tough time putting it down to do work that needs to be done.
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|I couldn't believe the producers of Dexter let the season be written and end in this fashion.  If you loved Dexter just leave him in the church with Deb telling him to put the knife down because this season just takes you on a nowhere trip to a complete downer of a finale that leaves you shaking your fists in anger.<br />Major spoilers from here.<br />Being that this is the final season why not let the villain be the most dangerous and vile of them all instead of this whimpering little brain surgeon-he didn't even rate and was pretty much dead on arrival.  A look back at the past baddies and this last guy was lacking in creativity- the bottom of the barrel not even worthy of the title serial killer maybe serial wimp.<br />Charlotte Rampling was superb as Dr Evelyn Vogel inventor of Harry's code and provided a ho-hum storyline reuniting Deb and Dexter after the Laguerta killing.  She would have been cooler as the split personality, secret villain hopped on experimental acid that transforms her into a Ms. Hyde with superhuman strength that picks up younger men or women at night clubs for some afterhours romping but no she ends up getting killed by her own son, the wimpy brain surgeon.<br />The Laguerta storyline from season 7 is where it all started going askew and provided this story arc about Deb quitting, blaming Dexter, trying to kill Dexter, forgiving Dexter, rejoining the force, starting to get back with Quinn and then left a stroked out vegetable while recovering from a gunshot wound.  Reads like a soap opera and not deserving of Showtime.  Deb deserved better than mercy killing then dumped in the ocean by Dexter with the rest of the vermin and why go through the trials and tribulations just to die poorly in the end.  Do you see and sense the frustration from the fans now?<br />A more fitting ending - Deb is recovering in the hospital, the villain takes her hostage in front of Dexter and escapes by boat resulting in a spectacular, high speed boat chase with thehurricane roaring in the background.  Both boats get caught up in a huge whirlpool out in the ocean, Dexter makes a spectacular leap from his boat to Deb's, a close call, evenly matched fight with Dexter killing the villain the boat motor explodes unable to take the strain of keeping the boat from being pulled down into the deep, both Deb and Dexter jumped into Dexter's boat as it circles around them in the vortex.  Racing back to Miami Deb dies from her wounds and fast forward to Deb's funeral with full police honors.  A few months later, Dexters meet Hannah and Harrison in Argentina. Fade.<br />Instead we get a hasty killing of the brain surgeon in police custody by Dexter.  No police department is that lame to let the brother of the victim in the building let alone the same room.<br />Hannah, oh what a tease, this character provided so much promise as a vehicle for Dexter's character growth from killer to semi-normal but why all the courtship just to fake us out and end up a single mom to Harrison.  We kind of knew it was never going to end happily but Dexter exiled in Alaska in an even more absurd episode of Axe Men.  Ridiculous.<br />The sales from a successful show season finale should be through the roof but instead the reviews are mixed and the fans upset by the ending.  If anything the final season seemed like it was hastily written from end to beginning without any thought to being creatively better than the past seasons just sub par and rather lumbering in pace.  Fans should be sad about the ending of a favorite show instead we're all mad about how it was ended.  We will miss you Dexter.
0525423842|5.0|Great for kids who wish to learn more about the legal profession. I highly recumbent this book for middle school school libraries.
B008220DGE|5.0|I watched this movie to study the actors and it was part of my class assignment from Sanford Meisner Acting Classes.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Lots of golden nuggets! Must read for anyone! It came at the right moment when i needed to hear just what i needed to hear! Thank you, James! You brought light into my life!
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Fun, enjoyable adventure with some okay special effects. Decent acting. Nothing great here, but a fun watch if you like the comic book characters come to life.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|This is a movie from my childhood and I now have it on DVD. I love it. It's such a good movie!!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Mini SimCity cute graphics but simpler.  Features will keep kids involved for a long time.  No fighting or violence as far as I can tell.  Two hints:  save your crowns and if you are at maximum storage and can't sell in the market you can use the ship to open storage spots to complete tasks
B00280LYIC|5.0|I'm a slow reader I take my time and absorb the words, this book made that impossible. It was fast and exciting. I watched the movie first and couldn't resist reading the book, and I was nit disappointed. Like it always goes, the movie epicly failed to portray the awesomeness that is The Lightning Thief.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|I liked Grisham's early books, and haven't read any of the more recent ones.  Sycamore got very good reviews so I thought I would give it a whirl.  As I read along, I kept waiting for some surprising plot twists and character development.  But the lead character Jake stayed two dimensional and bland, and the book plodded along.  I found the big final reveal very predictable given the story's time and place and the earlier clues revealed in the book.  I read this on vacation beside a pool in Key West, hoping for an interesting, exciting read, but was sorely disappointed.  I should have read something else.
B00G32VYDG|1.0|i know it would suck. looked lame and not a fan of Ryan. but my 10yr old son wanted to watch
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We love the wubbanub pacifiers.  When my son falls asleep, I had to search his basinet for the regular pacifiers, but with the wubbanub, it is always on his chest or right beside him.  He's 2 months old now and he's starting to grab it and play with it. So, that kills two birds with one stone.
B000001Y42|2.0|not a fan of limp biz but i love their cover of freedom. gave cd to a friend. they like
B007A2O3FO|5.0|This is a very enjoyable movie.  A good story and cast of characters, well acted.  If you know much about ghosts and going back and forth through time, it is not exactly correct but still really worth watching.  It is one that I will enjoy watching over and over.
B00EXVZZE8|5.0|It is so fun. So worth 99&cent;. I love this game! #&lt;3 I &lt;3 This Game! Thank you for creating this game.
039480497X|5.0|Absolutely my grown children's favorite book.  I read that over and over to them and now have given it to my grandchildren.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed it. Great details I recommend it highly. getting ready to read the next book. can't wait for the movie
B00915G6MG|5.0|This series  stays consistently excellent.  Love the characters and story lines.  I will also comment that I usually only watch British cerebral television shows because they  treat viewers with respect and you actually have to use your mind to figure out the plot.  This US show stands right up there with the British shows in respect for the viewers.
B00CE03UOC|1.0|OK Mr. Nagware, you want me to write a review? Take a star off for bugging me about it.<br />The included boards go from 5x5 to 9x9. If you've ever played a flow game before, that is probably too easy. I whipped through the first pack in about 8.5 minutes. Take another star off for not being challenging enough.<br />Why, oh why, does the screen have to flash every time I complete a line, and every time the board changes? I'm seriously annoyed and getting a headache, which is the opposite of what I want when trying to spend time relaxing with a puzzle game. Sorry, there's another star gone.<br />Wait, did you seriously just try to bribe me with the VIP pack if I tell my friends about you? Really? Sorry, not going to happen and take another star off for presumption.<br />Oh dear, I'm afraid I don't have very many stars left for you. Better luck next time.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|You can't do anything.  This app is a bore.  I am a dog that hates this app.  I give this app 1 star.<br /><br />  :-[<br /><br />  :'(<br /><br />  :-(
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|works right out of the box using porter and cable assorted nails from Home Depot just make sure the nails are 18 gauge and straight angle!
B00138KFYO|4.0|This is terrific Sixties rock 'n roll artistry.  I only rated it four stars because I thought my personal memory of my introduction to it may favorably color my attitude to it.  First week of freshman year this guy downstairs turned his speakers full, put them in the window and blasted &#34;Down On Me&#34; all over the quad for days.  I loved it.  Another freshman - still a friend, as it happens - knocked on his door and asked him to turn it down because he was trying to study.  It was quite the scene.  Janis, we hardly knew ye.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Without having read the books, I decided to watch this.  I must say, having read the books now, I very highly suggest you do that FIRST.  The books make the introduction to the movie much clearer.  Otherwise, the beginning of the movie feels rushed and just jumps right into the plot without you really having any idea what's going on.  Otherwise, the movie was quite good and the acting was top notch.  For me, watching a second time really make it a good watch.  Enjoy!
B003NX75B8|4.0|It was really weird and confusing until I got it. Then it was good. I liked the other John green books better.
B0014DW3OS|4.0|If you want to take a walk on the dark side of the moon then this is your movie. The violence is epic and Denzel is an incredible actor. This is one hard punch. Just be ready.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is surely the best tablet/phone cleaner invented. I definitely recommend this app for you to try out for yourself.
B00170F0WU|5.0|After watching this movie, I felt like I had somehow outsmarted myself. I am not one bit sorry for having watched it however, it has taken a bit for me to get past the eye of the movie which is about light and dark. I once met an Irish poet and though we laughed at him, we all knew what he said was to some degree correct. Or, should I say that I did.  He told a man that I knew at the time, \\"For Christ's sake (yada person) we all know we were put here to f'n suffer. There are rays of light in the world but it takes a careful eye to catch those rays and you have to snatch them as fast as you can and hold them tight. They are dear. Both characters held those rays and burned them into their hearts. Oh, there is a song that reflects this, CATCH A FALLING STAR AND PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET, SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY!<br /><br />Reno and I think her name is Portland are both brilliant in this film.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|We enjoyed the stars and the twists in the plot. It was a great follow on to Red. It provided a great evening.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|Every youngest child, at one time or another, feels he's being picked on for being the youngest - and wishes his whole family WOULD JUST DISAPPEAR!  That's exactly what happens to Kevin McCallister - and jolly mayhem ensues when he realizes he must defend the family home from a couple of bungling burglars.<br /><br />Great holiday fun for the whole family!  This and the original \\"Home Alone\\" are two of my daughter's favorites - and now share that favored status with my granddaughter!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Exciting movie - lots of action - acting was very good - Jennifer Lawrence (she makes almost any movie worth watching).
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I decided to use the NIV version of the Bible instead of the American Standard version. The Bible program itself, seem to be a very good one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good hidden object game.  Nice graphics enjoy the characters.  Doesn't require a lot of sit down time.  I like the the them of the rooms.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I will give this 5 stars for doing a good job. It really cleans as it said. Good good  i appreciated it ks mobile
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|SUICIDE, A GREAT PAY BACK THEME, BELIEVABLE STORY LINE, CHARACTERS THAT ARE REALISTIC, WITH TWISTS AND TURNS THAT FINALLY LEAD TO A HAPPY ENDING FOR ALL PLUS A FREE LESSON IN PROBATE LAW WHICH EVERYONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF, AND A HISTORY OF THE DEEP SOUTH.  I BELIEVE FORGIVENESS IS ONE OF THE UNIVERSAL KEYS TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN AND MR. GRISHAM BROUGHT THIS HOME BEAUTIFULLY....
1616551151|5.0|If you're a big fan of the Dragon Age series, this is definitely worth the purchase. I debated about it for a little bit, finally chose to go for it, and definitely do not regret it! It's filled with beautiful illustrations. It's true that most of this information you can glean from the codexes in the game already, but it's so nice to have it in this beautiful little book all nice and organized for whenever you want to look at it. I absolutely love it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great skill game. Lots of levels and good  variety of game highly recommended.<br /><br />Keep up the good updates. Great graphics too.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Clint Eastwood always delivers authentic movies. The actors he picked looked like the real men portrayed. The movie made me feel like I was one of the Marines taking the beaches at Okinawa.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Absolutely riveting!  Fabulous characters....thrilling story line!  Unexpected twists and turns ....full of passion ...power and emotion!<br />Don't miss this one!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Programed it on my smart TV according to instructions but it still won't work. Got be something out there that works & user friendly.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|One of the best action movies I have ever seen.  Will keep you on the edge through out the entire movie.  Great Acting and plot.l
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I always want to play the game. The idea is strategic and addictive. I would recommend it for long bus rides or just entertainment
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game helps to minimise stresses from work.<br />I can get lost in the world of sweets and not worry about the problems of the world. fun fun fun in the sun sun sun.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Its fun and challenging. Only thing I didn't like about is that every time you crash it goes all the way back to the begining so its start over again.
