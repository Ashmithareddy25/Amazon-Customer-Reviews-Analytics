B000AXSN5G|5.0|What a gift this album is.  Neil reveals so much about who he is in this beautiful look back at childhood, Canada, his father, his family and the mysticism of music. Do writers  really \\"make it up\\" or does it already exist, just waiting to manifest through them? Neil often says he does not know where the music comes from, but is thankful for it and does all he can to remain open to it.  I find the album to be deeply moving and powerful, especially The Painter, Falling Off The Face Of The Earth, Prairie Wind and my favorite, This Old Guitar with its simple melody, humble and reverent lyrics, Ben Keith's slide guitar and Emmylou Harris vocal, it is just so good.  I just realized that next year will be 40 years that Neil has been important in my life. Thank you so much.
B000063V8R|5.0|I'm falling in love with this show all over again while watching it through a newbies eyes!  Great extras and great menus!  The menu for the last disk is a wonderful switch reflecting on the cliffhanger episode!
B00005QJDG|5.0|As I have said about a billiion times, I love Dream Theater, my favorite band ever! After collecting all of their studio albums I finally got around to getting this live album. I must say, it's frigging awesome! The production is great, the setlist has minimal errors (i'll get to it soon), and, hell, even James doesn't sound bad. Here's a quick rundown of this album.<br /><br />PERFORMANCES:<br /><br />DRUMS/BACKING VOCALS-Mike Portnoy-Very good performance. He managed to get every beat exactly how it's done and the bass drums sound great. 10/10<br /><br />BASS GUITARS-John Myung-Very good as well. He does an exlellent job here. 10/10<br /><br />KEYBOARDS-Jordan Rudess-JR's first live album with DT does not disappoint. He also gives a great solo on disc 2. 10/10<br /><br />LEAD VOCALS-James LaBrie-He sounds great. IMO, he sounded good on \\"Once In A Livetime\\", but he sounds GREAT here. 10/10<br /><br />GUITARS/BACKING VOCALS-John Petrucci-THE highlight of the band. He also amnages to add great solos to the songs. 11/10<br /><br />Overall band performance: 10/10<br /><br />SETLIST:<br /><br />Great! It spans the band's enitre career (up to this point). It contains SFAM and (the song) A Change of Seasons in their entirety, an exellent keyboard solo from Mr. Jordan Rudess himself, a track during the performance of SFAM with guest singer Theresa Thomason singing over one of John Petrucci's guitar solos, and loads of the bands classic songs. The only complaint is the lack of the band's breakthrough song - Pull Me under. It was the band's most well-known song, so why the hell didn't they play it? At least they play \\"Metropolis Part 1\\" and \\"Learning To Live\\".<br /><br />Overall setlist rating: 9.5/10 (10/10 if they played \\"Pull Me Under\\".)<br /><br />The tracks -<br /><br />1. Regression 5/5<br /><br />2. Overture 1928 5/5<br /><br />3. Strange Deja Vu 5/5<br /><br />4. Through My Words 5/5<br /><br />5. Fatal Tragedy 5/5<br /><br />6. Beyond This Life 5/5<br /><br />7.

0140177396|4.0|\\"Of mice and men\\" is a story about two friends as different as fire and water. George smart and calm on the one hand-  the unpredictable childish Lennie one the other hand. In the time of the great Depression they are trying to make a living as farm workers with the dream of owning a farm. But Lennie's clumsiness causes problems all the way through. Because of him they had to leave the last farm. Hence George organised a new job on a farm, where the story is set. <br /> <br />Remarkable is John Steinbeck's fascination for symbols. Every effect of a scene seems to be reasoned and prepared. In the beginning the surrounding is described in a detail. If you'll think about it and take your time you'll find the image Steinbeck tries to create. The style is pretty easy. The book consists mostly of simple and short dialogues. That makes the book comfortable to read. No time is wasted by the narration of unnecessary things. It keeps you reading on and on -looking forward for the next incident.  <br /> <br />The characters are well created even if you'll have the feeling that some of them are brought in to get the story ahead. Many characters appear at a single moment, which may confuses. But all in all they look real and the reader can form his opinion about each character. <br /> <br />So you'll rush trough the book of 100 pages...expecting an powerful and fantastic ending -  an expectation, which shall not be fulfilled!! Steinbeck initiates an abrupt, unspectacular ending. I was disappointed and somehow left in the dark... Aside that the book is absolutely worth reading!  <br />

B0000C1733|5.0|Reviewing a compilation is a difficult thing for a fan-- really you have to look at it from a different perspective than you normally would-- does this serve the purpose it's trying to serve?  And as a first entry point for a casual listener, is it going to provide a good introduction to the act?  It seems that compilations have a habit, regardless of their original intent, of being the first thing people look for.  And finally, you have to get past personal preferences on track selection-- everyone has their favorites, but does what is on here serve the purpose it needs to? <br /> <br />So the Red Hot Chili Peppers released an album titled \\"Greatest Hits\\", and long and short that's about what this is.  It restricts itself to the John Frusciante-era (most likely because any earlier Chili Peppers material, including the piece off of \\"Mother's Milk\\" included here, would have had to have been licensed, but also because none of the early stuff saw any real commercial success), and yeah, it provides a good overview of that time in the band's career, it covers pretty much all the hits, so it does what's trying, and it'd serve as a good entry point for a casual listener. <br /> <br />The record leans heavily on \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magick\\" and \\"Californication\\", with all of the singles from both albums-- \\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Give It Away\\", \\"Breaking the Girl\\", and \\"Under the Bridge\\" from \\"Blood Sugar...\\" as well as recorded-around-the-same-time soundtrack hit (and as a sidenote seemingly endlessly played on radio when I was a junior in high school) \\"Soul To Squeeze\\" and \\"Scar Tissue\\", \\"Parallel Universe\\", \\"Otherside\\", \\"Californication\\" and \\"Road Trippin'\\" from \\"Californication\\".  This is further augmented by one track from \\"Mother's Milk\\" (Stevie Wonder cover \\"Higher Ground\\"), one from \\"One Hot Minute\\" with Dave Navarro on guitar (\\"My Friends\\"), two from \\"By the Way\\" (the title track and \\"Universally Speaking\\", which did quite well in Europe as I understand it) as well as two newsongs. <br /> <br />This is a pretty fair represenation of the band-- it covers pretty much the breadth of the sound they've explored over the past few years-- from the deeply funky (\\"Higher Ground\\") to balladry (\\"Under the Bridge\\") and quite a bit in between.  Just about all the hits are on here-- curiously left off were \\"The Zephyr Song\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" from \\"By the Way\\" and \\"Warped\\" and \\"Aeroplane\\" from \\"One Hot Minute\\".  All of these received substantial airplay, and with the compilation only stretching to 66 minutes, there's certainly room to put them on.  Again, I'm not one to argue my favorite album cuts, but it seems odd that these were left off (although oddly enough the companion video disc on the CD/DVD edition includes the videos for all of these but \\"Warped\\"). <br /> <br />The two new tracks are both pretty good-- \\"Fortune Faded\\" has a funky beat like we really didn't see on \\"By the Way\\" (not necessarily a bad thing) and a suitably esoteric lyric.  \\"Save the Population\\" is a bit moodier, and actually of the two the one I prefer, with an odd, sort of mid-tempo muddling (but a superb beat from Chad Smith) and all in all just a kind of wacky piece. <br /> <br />One other point to be made-- the album sounds fantastic-- particularly the \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magick\\" material, which really could benefit from a remastering.  The liner notes include brief essays (well, some not so brief) from each of the four band members and a number of photos. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a great compilation, and no doubt a good entry point for a newcomer.  I'd usually recommend seeking the albums out rather than going after a compilation, in that case I'd recommend \\"By the Way\\", which wasn't overflowing with hits, but in my assessment was the best record the band did, but this is certainly as good a place to start.
B000000WG4|5.0|Mike Oldfield's first solo album, leading to a string of distinctive works spanning a decade before he drifted towards commercial mediocrity, remains a masterpiece.       As progressive as instrumental progressive rock gets.       We've all heard the opening piano-and-bells sequence in The Exorcist, but surprisingly few have listened to the equally-remarkable remaining 20 minutes of Part 1, much less Part 2.       Oldfield specializes in complex, overlapping, syncopated melodies and polyrhythms, foreshadowing the nouveau-classical works of Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, Steve Reich and many others.
B000000W5B|5.0|The Stones, before they found chardonnay, fitness trainers and capitalism and turned into the most amazing (and in some ways lovable) money machine in the history of music, had a feel of menace and danger around them. Their songs, like \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" in the times they were recorded, scared people. Not like \\"Revolution No. 9\\" scared people, but in a way that was very tangible. Altamont only sealed the deal. Goats Head Soup represents the tail end of that sharply focused menace, as the depleted Stones reach the end of the line, dipped in coke and heroin and sleazy sex and strung out on the end of the 60's idealism they always seemed to reject and expose, finally drowned by their own dark brand of hedonism. It should have been a mess, but these are the Stones and you don't get tagged as the world's greatest rock n roll band without the talent to back it up. Jagger and Richards rank among the very best and prolific songwriters we have ever known in any genre, and here they chart their own demise in a way that some fans just can't relate to. Much of the music sounds fatigued, but in a way that the fatigue becomes their \\"sound.\\" Goats Head Soup is an album about being very tired, very wasted, still dancing with Mr. D way past the time to stop. The party is way past over, but the Stones remain, snorting up every last line in the most unhealthy manner. This album is the final nail in the coffin of the 60s, a sobering artifact and cautionary tale, and, to these ears, decline has never sounded this sad, this alluring and inviting. There is a voodoo here, particularly at the end of \\"Can You Hear The Music,\\" a slow descent into a druggy jungle and madhouse, where the music becomes an echoey, fading hollow shell, but where so many people and fans reject it as the Stones as band at rock bottom, I see it as the Stones inhabiting and almost luxuriating in their beautiful ruination. Jagger, as if from a hospital bed, moans \\"Can you feel the magic\\" and it is the magic of aman, who, with his band, has been blown out to the edge of death, derangement and depravity and brought you along in harrowing, blues-burnt, rock-gut song. All that and \\"Angie.\\"
B00004T9AM|5.0|The fourth, and probably final of Oldfield's instrumental masterpieces. Heavily synthesized, but still rich and original and atmospheric.
068485743X|5.0|This book is simplistic in its logical approach to writing. In succinct terms, the author explains the importance of making a quick impression.  Excellent reference.
B00004T9AI|5.0|Like Tubular Bells, Ommadawn consists primarily of two long, progressive instrumental compositions, accomodating the 2-sided nature of the time's vynil LPs.  <br />     A bit more tame and etherial, and classical in structure, this is probably his most sophisticated piece. Like Tubular Bells, it foreshadows new-age classical, but with a distinctively atmospheric quality not unlike that of ambient music two decades later.
038572179X|3.0|I read this book because it was recommended here on amazon.com.  I knew very little of it, but had heard rave reviews.  I had difficulty connecting with the characters and the writing was so long winded.   <br />The premise is an interesting one--what are the consequences of one youthful act upon all involved--but I found myself more interested in the later acts of the story than in the initial one.  It was part one that seemed to drag on forever for me. <br /> <br />As I mentioned, I did find it better as it progressed, but in all, it took way too long to grab my interst.

B00005JNTX|3.0|All very pretty; pretty boring. I watched it through only because I bought what I thought would be a pretty fantastic flick, but it's all on the surface and a little too dopey for my tastes, even if it did have its roots in a graphic strip or whatever -- that's not enough to excuse the poverty of depth. <br /> <br />Oh well.

B00078XKDE|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I popped in the CD. I only bought it because of vague good memories of the reviews and because I liked the name of their previous album (Keep On Your Mean Side). I popped it in, and... <br />1. No Wow- ...I was greeted by a sinister, strangely compelling fuzz. After I was comptetely addicted to the sound itself, the voice came, and I was hooked. Telephone Radio Germany is at the end of this or the beginning of Love Is A Deserter. I can't quite tell, but that's the only part of the album I regularly skip anyway. <br />2. Love Is A Deserter- I love a song where, when the singer tells you to sleep, you suddenly become wide awake and watchful. This is one of them (\\"Hammering In My Head\\" by Garbage is another). <br />3. Dead Road 7- I can feel the lonely, winding road... <br />4. The Good Ones- Seemingly wistful, maybe even happy, until they start talking about being self-destructive to make yourself appreciate what is around. <br />5. I Hate The Way You Love- My favorite. It has some of the best lyrics on the CD, as well as a nicely insane feeling. <br />6. I Hate The Way You Love Pt. 2- She mournfully, beautifully sings \\"I hate the way you love\\" over and over. <br />7. At The Back Of The Shell- Playground hand clapping and boldly attacking words. <br />8. Sweet Cloud- More good lyrics: \\"I love him so, in turn I kill. I know no words to make it right.\\" <br />9. Rodeo Town- She bitterly asks, \\"If I'm so evil, why are you satisfied?\\" <br />10. Murdermile- A fast, wild, raucous song interspersed with a guy saying \\"You've got me on the wrong track honey.\\" <br />11. Ticket Man- A nicely melancholy song that sounds like it was sung during the Great Depression, at least to me, because of the simplicity and worry. <br />
B000000OE7|4.0|I put off buying this for many years.  Having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous, I didn't want to taint my perceptions of the Queen legacy.  So I ignored this album.  Then, one day, I was listening to Innuendo and that old curiosity crept in again.  I came here and read many positive reviews, so I took the plunge.  I came out the other side very content. The legacy had not been tainted. <br /> <br />The album is uneven in places, but the songs that are good are VERY good (Mother Love, Let me Live).  With some albums like this, it is often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in.  Now, I don't know exactly how this was done, but the songs feel seamless, even the dance track \\"You Don't Fool Me,\\" which I can picture being blasted at high volumes in a late-night club.  Of course there is some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running out (especially in \\"Mother Love\\"), but upon the conclusion of the album, I want to say to the Brian and the boys (men), \\"You've done good.\\"
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Neil Young has been one of my biggest influences, and he always amazes me with his brilliant albums.  He bedazzled me with Greendale, his last album, and I was looking very forward to owning prairie wind, but as it turns out, pw is not as good as I expected.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good album, but not great. I definitely like it though.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|About as close to a classic adaption of a novel as you are going to get, on all levels.  Actors are great, costumes are great, dialogue true to book, scenary is great.  Just all around great.  Watch it with someone you love!
0471702188|5.0|This is a great book. If I'm not reading it, I'm thinking about what I've learned from the text and how to apply it to business valuations.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I already have the Japanese version of this DVD, and it was well worth its price!  The music and graphics were impressive!  It's also very exciting to see the improved version of Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Yuffie, Vincent, Red XIII, Cait Sith, Sephiroth, and everyone else.  The story brings back memories of the game FFVII, it's definitely not just another completely unconnected story with the same heroes saving the earth!  It has a lot to do with the video game, even some other characters from the video game make appearance in this movie!  (Hint:  remember the turks?!)  The fight scenes were cool, you get to see all the original characters from the game in battle, especially Cloud, Tifa, Vincent, and Sephiroth!  If you ever played the game, then you will definitely love this movie!  Imagine, seeing the characters you love actually moving in high-class motion in battles!  Some parts of this movie was also humorous and heart-warming~  And I don't think I need to tell you how great the characters look!  Beautiful does not even quite say it!!!  Cloud is like absolutely cool and hot!  Imagine Cloud riding on his motorbike, wearing sunglasses, and carrying multiple swords!  WOW, what a sight!!!  And the others all give you images of perfection!  The girls are the prettiest you will ever see in games/animes!!!  This movie is really great, breath-taking I call it!  So what are you waiting for?  Get it now!  Especially if you are a fan of Final Fantasy!  (If you are, then you must be crazy not to get this!)  Final Fantasy VII:  Advent Children seriously, ROCKS!!!
0671449028|5.0|Well, it was a great surprise to find such a beautiful and fun book. <br />My 17-month-old daughter simply loves it. <br />The drawings are wonderful, the story and the rhymes are funny and it has hard pages which is very nice because the book lasts a long time! <br />I totally reccomend it! <br />Silvia Bilacchi
0679720200|5.0|I am not a philosopher, quite honestly I stumbled into the world of self studied existensialism as I was finishing college where I specialized in Social Psychology. A professor saw me reading Sartre's 'No Exit' and recommended it to me. A year later I read The Stranger.<br /><br />The Stranger is the manifesto of complete alienation and the absurdity of feeling and emotion in human life. These are important ideas to grasp as you read existensialism, absurdity, Zen Buddhism or Philosophical Marxism. Merely saying the word 'alienation' is one thing. This small 120+ page book so thoroughly, poetically and sadly draws the reader first person into the existence of someone completely alienated from the world that you experience it.<br /><br />I understand the low reviews from some people. The annihilation of emotion is not one easily grasped or comfortably dealt with, and it is one many people will hopefully never fall into, yet it is one that is needed to be understood by many to come to grips with the absurdity that grasps many of our everyday experiences.<br /><br />A major lesson from Sartre's drama 'No Exit' is the lesson of the  powerful impact of other people's judgements on the shaping of who we are, and that a form of Hell is the inability to escape each others judgements. 'No Exit' loses some impact in that as a drama it is entirely expressed in the third person. The power of 'The Stranger' is that the reader is immeresed as a participant. Page by page you become an actor, a witness, the only mirror to Meursault's world of nihilism. The reader creates and is immerssed at once in Meursault's Hell.<br /><br />This book is eloquent, beautiful and the power of it is that you as the reader have to supply the emotion to the story. It's your ever growing awakening of sadness and shame to the human condition that will change you forever while reading it.<br /><br />On a lighter note it is also the inspiration for the song 'Killing an Arab' by The Cure.
B0006A9IVQ|1.0|This dvd should not be out in the market for its very poor reproduction. It cannot even be classified as a second generation duplicate (if you know what I mean). I have seen this movie so many times when I was young and I loved it. I was so dissappointed when I watched it on my computer (how much more on my player at home). I have to give one star because half is not available here.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Okay, I am listening to Neil Young's latest release and what are these people who are giving it only one or two stars talkin' about? This is great stuff! This is classic Neil! It's not time for him to \\"retire\\" as one inept reviewer claimed, it's time for him to fly even higher...burn even brighter...<br /><br />It used to take at least two listenings of a Neil Young recording to decide whether or not I liked it but that's when I was young and foolish. Now I can tell from the moment the music begins because I now understand that Neil's music is not something one can superficially appreciate, Neil is the \\"realest of the real\\" and although he says he doesn't know where the music comes from, I know, as every \\"true\\" fan knows, this music comes from deep within his spirit...his soul...Neil Young is Mr. Soul himself!<br /><br />For those who whined about the overproduction of this recording, put down the crack pipe and realize the Truth that Neil can never be a \\"sellout\\". It's just not in his blood. You sold out when you gave this recording a bad review.<br /><br />Neil Young is too much a part of my psyche to abandon him now. I'm not saying that he's infallible...he's quite fallible. He's not the greatest singer, he's not the greatest musician  but it is his raw humanity and his true humble willingness to bow down before the gods of creativity that make Neil Young one of the greatest and when he goes, the world will be a lonelier place.<br /><br />LONG LIVE NEIL YOUNG!!!!
B0009I7NNA|3.0|Reasons why this cd is trash-His voice the \\"Happy\\" sound of the guitars and its just way way way too different than their first 2 cds. LISTEN TO WAKING THE FALLEN THIS KINDA SUX! <br /> <br />But Beast and the Hartlet, Bat Country, Trashed and Scattered, and Seize teday are ok songs

It also come with a bonis Cd, Including 3 unrealeased songs, which are out of this world! I love \\"Mona Lisa\\", But i was disipontied when they dident include one of her unrelsased songs called \\"Over to You Now\\", but aparntly if you live in Japan it is included on her new single \\"Someday (I Will Understand).
6304119046|5.0|This is probably the most underrated film ever made.  It's even more exciting than Speed Racer reruns. <br />
B000050X31|3.0|First of all Kathleen Battle's voice is wonderful for Pamina.  Whoever the racist bigot is, please refrain from ever writing another online review.  I have to say that this production is probably my least favorite in my collection.  The Magic Flute is also my least favorite out of Mozart's most famous operas.  It lacks Mozart's dramatic sense that we get in: Don Giovanni, Le nozze di Figaro, and Cosi fan tutte.  It's still a wonderful opera with nice moments, but it's not my favorite.  This production bored me.  Mr. Hemm was great as Papageno and Ms. Battle was great as Pamina (I've seen her do better).  Tamino is just a boring role no matter who sings it, as is Sarastro, so no comment on those two.  The Queen of the Night disappointed me both vocally and in her acting.  Her high f's in her flute register were not round and beautiful.  She also acted very poorly...she basically just stood and sang her two arias.  These arias should be highlights, but in this production I was disappointed.  She needed to be more pleasent on \\"O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn!...Zum Leiden bin ich auserkoren\\" and she needed to be crazier and more intense on \\"Der Hoelle Rache.\\"  This is when the Queen of the Night finally reveals herself as the true villain, so all of her inhabitions need to cease.  After many years she reveals to her daughter her true colors.  This should be HUGE!!!  Anyway, the Three Ladies in Waiting for the Queen of the Night are wonderful.  I really enjoyed them.  I still recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a decent opera experience.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|People just don't get it. An artist must always grow, else Art stagnates. Folk Music itself is a protean beast, undergoing an eternal metamorphosis. Unfortunately, those who are not True Artists believe that Artists must remain the same, and continually rehash their original triumphs. <br /> <br />Real poets are always misunderstood. Dylan's art is what great art is: paradoxical, multifaceted, impossible to pin down, impossible to ignore. This film is a portrait of Freedom pursued and Freedom attained, only to be condemned by those who do not comprehend and are therefore lost in the labyrinth that Genius inhabits.  <br /> <br />Dylan followed his own vision where it took him, heedless of the banal snares and molds within which the small-minded and those lacking in Vision sought to entrap him.  <br /> <br />Real poets recognize that the pursuit of Vision is Vision itself, the pursuit of Truth is Truth itself. The path of the Poet is a solitary path, down Diamond Highways, past Twelve Misty Mountains, across Windy Beaches, one hand waving free, silhouetted by the See.  <br /> <br />The Poet's path, though personal, is also universal. Look up at the stars. There is mystery there. Can you comprehend it? Must you comprehend it? The mystery of stars IS their Truth, it IS their Beauty. And in the comtemplation of Mystery, there cometh Understanding.  <br /> <br />To be a real artist, one must be true to one's own vision. A butterfly is not a butterfly when it is pinned to a board. The small-minded do not recognize protean visionaries. They tell you that when they do not understand something, that there is nothing to understand. They murder to dissect.  <br /> <br />Albert Einstein once said: \\"Great Spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.\\" This is still true. You can read it in some of the other reviews of this same film.  <br /> <br />Martin Scorcese has proved what a great artist he is, by understanding what makes Dylan a great artist, andby translating the vision of his understanding into great art in its own right.  <br /> <br />Here's to Dylan, and Woody, and Leadbelly too.  <br /> <br />Dig yourself.
0783230079|4.0|Comedy is hard, physical comedy even harder but Downing is such a talented actor to pull it off.  He's in a great cast of actors with a good story that addressing some fairly basic human questions, so it's all here.  Odd, looking at Chaplin it is also dated 1993 -- he must have been one busy actor that year. <br /> <br />This is probably a knee-jerk reaction review after reading the other ones.  I can't believe no one mentioned Alfre Woodard, another incredible actor.  As often as Downing has me laughing she has me crying, she is an absolute delight from start to finish. <br /> <br />Another reaction I have is the topic of Downing's personal life.  Talk about the actor and his work.  As far as actors go their work is where they find it.  Who knows, or cares, why he took on tripe like Gothika.  Hopefully he has his best work ahead of himself -- I'd like to think that applies to all of us so we don't have to come back and tie up any loose ends. <br /> <br />The movie at this price is a steal -- esp since you can show it to children, how rare is that?
B000255LIY|2.0|Well as an EQ coach, and someone who studies nonverbal communication, it's interesting - and very illuminating -- that you can take one of the best scripts ever written, and leave the words as is, and come off (in this case) with a decidedly inferior product.  What's fascinating is this is like the undrebelly, the in side, of history.  What it was like for a family.  One thing that's good about the video is the outake and discussion at the end.  But this review is going to be all about - what WERE they thinking?  Who could follow O'Toole and Hepburn.  That's really the bottom line.  I can't imagine anyone present-day doing a better job than Glen Close, but she can't quite, and King Henri doesn't make the cut either. They have no power - as characters or as people.  I agree the sets aren't as good either.  They manage to make some of the lines even sound silly.  The one thing that's marvelous in this version -- FAR better -- is the King of France.  What a fantastic job Jonathan Rhys-Meyers did, and what a gorgeous young man.  Save your money.  See the original.  There's no, NO comparison.

B0009XT8YW|1.0|I was very excited knowing I was going to receive a remastered version of Barbra Streisand's Guilty album, one of her most popular albums of her career. Upon playing it, though, the audio quality, in addition to the importing quality ('ripping it' onto my pc's hard-drive) I found to be very sub-standard.  Upon reading the sleeve of the album, it stated that \\"Dual Discs\\" didn't conform to the same high standards for their audio reproduction as regular CD's, so you can imagine how disappointed I was at the lack of both quality and a 'remastered sound', which was also - in my opinion - lacking.  I therefore returned the item, and was further disappointed to be unable to find the regular CD remastered version (without the dual disc feature), for I wanted to reorder just the cd.  I still am without this great album...
B00004WKII|5.0|If you are a fan of Jimi Hendrix then do yourself a favor and buy this 4 disc set! I could not believe my ears when I heard these versions of the songs I've loved for years.  Jimi was an artist, every note that comes off the guitar is poetry.  Best song on the album Disc 2, Track 7, Bold as Love!!!!! I listen to it at least twice everyday.  No words, just music...If I haven't convinced you, read the other reviews...
068987474X|5.0|This book is the new bible for dating men.  What is so obvious to the authors, the men were dating, our friends and family, is here is simple black and white for us women to use as reference.  I am serious, when this comes out in paperback, I am getting a copy to carry with me at all times.  Men are not as difficult as we make them out to be and this book, combining humor and common sense, can help give women the confirmation they might need to realize, \\"He's just not that into you!\\".  And like the counterpart to this book, maybe you'll \\"be honest- you're not that into him either\\".  Definate, funny read.
B00005R1N3|4.0|I have to admit I have not watched this dvd version but when I was in high school back in the 70s I saw this movie @ a drive in also, along with texas chainsaw massacre and last house on the left. I found this one to be the most chilling one of the three because it left evything to your imagination by not ever revealing the menaceing person in the house other than a voice or a pair of eyes looking through a crack in the door. Your imagination can really keep you up @ nightt. Looking forward to adding this one to my horror collection.
B00004T8RK|4.0|2000: Rock is dead. Bands like Destiny's Child and Limp Bizkit rule the world. Radiohead has taken over the indie music industry and grunge no longer exists, leaving aside those sterile wannabies such as Creed Lifehouse and Matchbox 20. <br /> <br />Pearl Jam releases Binaural. Everybody knows Pearl Jam over and over again and is tired of them. It's the same crap. After six albums, the two latest of which have not had the success expected, Pearl Jam are outdated...but are they? <br /> <br />At first when I heard Binaural I was not in the least interested. On a brief listen, I said to myself \\"guys grow out of it. You are treading water\\". I thought poor old Eddie was souding very tired, and not able to iht the notes like he used to.  <br /> <br />Well...I managed to grab a cheap copy of \\"Binaural\\" one day and completely changed my mind. This is a very good album indeed. It's just that people tend to forget how good good bands can really be. The album goes certainly much further than \\"Yield\\". There are absolute stunning compoistions here, with Eddie and the band at his fullest potential, namely \\"Thin Air\\" , Insignificance\\" and \\"Of the Girl\\" while, in comparison, a superficial album as \\"Vs\\" sounds like the early work of a young punk band, and \\"No Code\\" of that same band maturing, but not having matured yet. <br /> <br />If anything, Pearl Jam is no longer being interested in re-hashing commercial ballads, or early grunge angst.  Why Binaural is ingored is simple: it lacks melodies, catchy choruses and that tends to disinterest people. Granted, you will not find a \\"Better Man\\", Daughter\\", \\"Alive\\" or \\"Given To Fly\\", here,...but woh wants that anyway?   <br /> <br />Pearl Jam's career has evolved as follows: <br />1) relevation: Ten <br />2) consolidation: Vs  <br />3) boundary pushing and risk taking: Vitalogy <br />4) experimentation and change of style: No Code  <br />5) return to form: Yield <br /> <br />Binaural is at the 6th stage. It is at the stage where the band develops the form using previous achivements. It is a completion of their ideas, techniques, and styles in a defying pre-millenium era. It  is the pinnacle of Pearl Jam's performance. <br />  <br />2002, Pearl Jam come back with one of their poorest albums ever: \\"Riot Act\\", and yet they are the big thing again.People talk about them. Everybody knows that Pearl Jam is still around. They tour. It's a comeback. \\"I am Mine\\" hits the charts. <br />Why?..... <br /> <br />Moral of the story. Don't believe the hype. Listen yourself. <br /> <br /> <br />
0440237688|3.0|The central themes in The Giver bring up a common question. What would life be like without emotions? Pain and suffering? Love? Personal choice? War? Color? I can't even begin to imagine what life would be like if there was not color. Lois Lowry does an amazing job of describing the life of a young boy named Jonas in a community lacking emotions and responsibility. Through Jonas, we the readers are given insight into what life would be like in a community like that.   <br /> <br />While I was reading The Giver, I realized that this book is very much like Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Both authors chose to write about a place where basic human rights are stripped away without the citizens even knowing there is something missing. I think that The Giver was written for a younger and less complex audience than Brave New World, but they are both very good books.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|What an awesome CD!!!  There is a hard CD and a not so hard CD.  I love EVERY song on the CD.  I cannot get enough of it.  You cannot burn a copy because it is protected but this CD is so good....people should be paying for it!  I have nothing bad to say about it at all.  Its awesome!!!
B00082IJ08|5.0|I'm surprised at how many clowns entirely missed the point of this album, which IMO comes very close to being amazing. The only flaw of the disc seems to be that it suffers a certain fear of being classified as a concept album, which it is. The concept? The state of modern humanity. <br /> <br />When analyzing any concept album, one frequently spends a great deal of time looking at the first and last few tracks. The statement couldn't be any more obvious here, as the second track is an obvious allusion to how badly modern society has screwed the world at large. The question it asks should be taken at face value and is therefore repeated frequently. We're then taken to task here and there with a few issues related to the subject matter (Kids with Guns, Feel Good Inc) especially the enjoyable jingoistic falsehoods mocked in 'dirty harry,' \\"the war is over, so said the speaker with the flight suit on.\\" The disc closes almost like the end of an essay, with everything summarized in the chilling narrative of \\"fire coming out of a monkey's head.\\" The brief vocals following this monologue and the two following tracks offer an ambiguous counterargument to the way things are presently going. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the sick funkiness and quality freestyles on this album are just the icing on the cake. Danger Mouse's production, while not perfect, jumps between myriad styles with minimal effort. Feel good inc and 'fire..' are both evidence to this fact. Especially awesome are the combinations of sequenced beats and acoustic guitar sounds... Also, the disc changes moods when appropriate by properly mixing up tempo and mood.  <br /> <br />This album is far deeper than its predecessor and it's entertaining to see the irony of a bunch of commercially-marketed cartoon primates trying to comment on the state of the very world that has produced them. It's a veritable cluster-F abstracted satire. <br /> <br />I do, however, think that here and there there are a few too many distractions from the overall point the album tries to make. In this regard, some of the freestyles seem entirely nonsensical and a few of the tracks pretty much pointless. Nevertheless, very few groups of individuals could pull off an effort this credible. Budget and commercial success are irrelevant, as they can't create something this valid and real. Props to all involved.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Taken from the `Hellblazer' comic book series, \\"Constantine\\" is a horrific, sickening, fun, campy, gore fest.  Keanu Reeves plays his regular wooden self helping Rachel Weisz try to save the hell-bound fate of her twin sister who committed suicide.  He has special powers to rid demons from earth and spends most of his time walking through the movie coughing up the results of years of smoking.  The story is simply Reeves trying to balance good and evil between God and Satan on earth.  He seeks out those old good-evil, angel-devil half breeds.  Some of his encounters are digitally amazing.  The story is mildly entertaining, but the effects are truly inspiring, if not nauseatingly inventive.  Reeves makes frequent trips to hell and the scenery is spectacular.  Tilda Swinton also makes a cameo as angel Gabriel who tells Reeves that basically, he is f***ed!  It's half funny and half scary. It is not a pleasant movie, but is nothing short of pure entertainment.  Not for young kids by any measure!

B00004W4UB|4.0|This was a surprise, as I didn't think Julia Roberts would ever attempt something serious and certainly not as intellectual as a costume drama.  Her accent is a little hoaky, but she actually did a pretty good job here and I wish this movie was more acknowledged than it is as this is one of (if not the) few on her resume that has substance.   <br /> <br />Instead of the traditional Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde journal entries and lab experiements, we see the good doctor falling apart from his chamber maid's perspective.  Mary Reilly, a controlled, obedient woman, is busy about the house while a mysterious stranger seems to float in and out of the house.  Eventually the stranger as well as the doctor (John Malcovich) take a shine to her.  Both find her attractive, no question, but they're both fascinated by her and what a mystery she is.  It follows the story of Jekyll and Hyde from an outsider's point of view (Mary's), and how a man is going mad with abuse of power.  Glen Close even has a cameo which was all too brief. <br />
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters with high hopes, and I wasn't dissapointed. This movie was awesome! I loved the storyline and all of the characters. Hopefully the DVD will have commentary and behind the scenes features. This is one of the greatest Disney creations ever.
0800177177|4.0|Gary Oldman has had 3 great roles thusfar to his career: Sid Vicious, Ludwig Von Beethovan, and Dracula.  Though he was very much a tool of the make up and wardrobe department in this movie, I dare say he has been the sexiest vampire in film history.   <br /> <br />Though we can't even count how many movies about Dracula have been made, this was one of the best tellings of the tale ever.  Other characters were fleshed out when otherwise forgotten and showed how important they were as well to the story.  What's odd about all film adaptations up until this point was that other films did not include the diary and correspondance aspect, which adds an oddly personal touch to it.  Here we get the impression that this started off as a business transaction that went terribly wrong. <br /> <br />Jonathan Harker (played by Keanu Reeves, who can't act his way out of a paper bag but is always supported by a steller supporting cast, hence giving this 4 rather than 5 stars) travels to Transylvania to close a real estate deal for a mysterious stranger.  Here he meets a strange, decrepid old man living in a spooky castle who insists he stay with him to tutor him in English customs.  He is actually being kept as a prisoner by Dracula and his three brides while he travels to England to seek out Mina, Jonathan's fiancee waiting at home.  Dracula believes that she is his long lost wife, Elizabeta, who committed suicide hundreds of years ago.  While in England, he plays the star crossed lover role to a T with Mina. <br /> <br />This is a love story, an aspect that I had never seen before in any other Dracula movies.  It was odd when I realized this, as I thought it was all about horror and revenge and coveting thy neighbor's wife.  Did it do anything for me?  Well, hard to say.  I'd never seen anything like this before, or since.  All involved were a tad on the overdramatic side, but that's the nature of the dialogue and with this genre.  As I was a sullen teenager when I saw this for the first time I was very much into the whole death and hearbreak thing, but now not so much.  It appeals to a certain segment into gothic stuff, but I was never much for goth.  I appreciate it as an art form, but that's as far as it goes for me. <br /> <br />I liked the secondary characters quite a bit here.  Lucy, the sex kitten friend of Mina's who is taken away by Dracula's charms.  Her trio of suitors: Quincy the Texan, Arthur the dapper British gentleman, and Jack the somewhat nerdy doctor.  Tom Waits also makes an appearance as Renfield, a devoted desciple of Dracula's locked in a mental institution and is quite funny.  The best of the best, however, is Anthony Hopkins, who plays the eccentric nutty professor with all his quirks intact and hilarious antics put together for their leader.
0440237688|5.0|When reading the giver for the first time I found it to be strange and not all that enjoyable, but after reading it for a second time I found that I noticed things that I hadn't noticed before. <br /> <br />Some of the things that I noticed the second time around was that all of the characters except Jonas and the Giver see in black and white.  There were other things That I found out along the way but you'll just have to read it and find out what they were. <br /> <br />All around I would recommend this book to anybody who reads.  It's a book for all ages and is enjoyable and entertaining.  I also found that the book made me think about things that I use to take for granted like my freedom to be who I want to be, and act the way that I want to act.  It's a definite got to read for anyone who's living in the world today and feels like they are just one person in a crowd. <br />
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I want to adress my take of things people have said about this album.  I've only heard waking the fallen and city of evil, but between the two, city of evil is much better.  Too many songs on waking are just standard speed pick/palm mute riffs with very little engery or creativity.  They do however pull off that style well and i dont think that waking the fallen is a bad album.  City of evil however, has much more complex songs with plenty of variety.  Some songs change styles 4 or 5 times in the same song without sounding overdone.  <br /> <br />   I also love the pacing on this album.  I find i naturally start headbanging alot easier to this album than waking, the riffs are very fast and there songs are long enough for intricate melodies and harmonies to develop.  On waking they do not really give songs a chance to do this. <br /> <br />Lastly ther are some amazing solos on this album, in fact my only complaint is that the singer doesnt shut up enough and just let the band jam.  However in MIA ther is a really long drawn out thrash solo that is pretty rockin.  Much has been said about the singing on this album.  It is weak and doesnt work on every song but I think that some of the songs havea real nice early 90s alternativ sound to them that mixes with the intense riffs in a pretty badass weapon.  I think this is especially true on the song bat country. <br /> <br />This album reminds me of number mainly in the fact that the singer had to change is his style, much like maiden changed thier singer completly for thier thrd album.  also the songs changed from more punk to more metal on both albums.  I hope Avenegd keeps up this trend.  This is definently not a sell out album at all, if anything it is less radio friendly than waking the fallen.    <br /> <br />Also, if i had to compare this band to anyone right now it would be Angra or Blind Guardian. so if you liked this album check those guys out.
B000AM4PBS|4.0|To everyone saying this release is stupid and pointless:    Every television series puts out a complete boxed set when all the seasons are released onto DVD.  This is for collectors and people who don't own all the seasons.  If you already have seasons 1-9, then buy season 10 and send in for the box if you want it.  If you don't want it, then don't send in for the box and buy season 10 separately like you always do.  And by the way, $30 for a season on DVD is CHEAP.  Try buying the X-Files on DVD, they're nearly $100 per season!    This is a really cool release for avid Friends fans.  Why is everyone whining about it?  There are more important things in life than complaining about something like this.
B000A6T262|5.0|I was wondering what was in the set, Amazon did not describe it, Thank You to the Reviewer here who told me what to expect.  I have all the movies but not in special edition.  The last box set that came out had some in special edition I have been waiting for when it would come out that all 10 were in special edition.  This is a must have for my husband and I.
B0007XT87G|5.0|What happens when Tool, Dream Theater and Pink Floyd suddenly meld into one?  You get this awesome album.  This platter has the production and \\"vibe\\" of the best Tool, the musicianship of Dream Theater (Tool and Floyd are right up there with DT, don't get me wrong), and the pathos of older Floyd.  Or something like that.  Seriously, this is one killer disc and definitely in that \\"audiophile-quality\\" category for those that care.  LAZARUS may be the best song you'll never hear on the radio.  Love it.
0224071262|4.0|To those who say the book is biased should look at our own books on Hitler. Wouldn't you say the books all portray Hitler as bad? No books significantly recognised what Hitler did which was good to Germany - the construction of the Autobahn, the complete recovery of German's economy, and the rebuilding of Germany's army. So because of Hitler's good deeds, would a Jew be writing a book promoting Hitler?
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Let me start off by saying Mezmerize isn't a bad album by any means. It's just that, I'm a huge SOAD fan so I assumed Mezmerize would be yet another rock-your-socks-off metal album. Sadly, it's not. In short, there's definitely a few things they could've done differently to make this a much better album.    First of all, I'd kind of like to know what happened to Serj. I mean, Daron's a good songwriter and everything but he really shouldn't be getting more airtime than the \\"LEAD VOCALIST\\". Last time I checked, Serj was their lead singer and that's exactly how it should've stayed. Another thing that bothers me about this album is that it really doesn't have the signature sound that got them where they are today. I mean, change is good but I think the change happened a little too fast.     This album has a few songs such as \\"Revenga\\" and \\"Question\\" which I really enjoyed, but it honestly doesn't make up for all the mediocre tunes that make up this album. By mediocre, I mean you lose interest in the songs a little sooner than you should. Why? Because the songs on this album weren't quite energetic enough and the songs that were simply ran out of gas way too fast.     So all in all, I feel that Mezmerize is a disappointing follow-up to their 3 previous albums and I hope Hypnotize has something much better in store for us. Something that will, once again, blow everyone away.

B000002KOQ|5.0|The Joni Mitchell album in question is magnificent, and belongs in anyone's library. That's a given, as is the fact that anyone reading these little informal fan reviews on Amazon is most likely to be at the very least interested in the artist and her work, if not a confirmed fan.  <br />HOWEVER my reason for this posting is to make a polite response to a review by B Marold of PA (see below) who compares Ms Mitchell to the British singer/songwriter Sandy Denny, with the caution that Ms Denny \\"may be a one-trick pony\\". This comment seems hardly fair, given that Sandy Denny died in 1978 at the age of 31, when her most productive years of work almost certainly still lay ahead of her. I just wanted to remind myself, as much as anyone else, that perhaps we all need to make our comparisons thoughtfully and sensitively.

B000001FT0|5.0|I actually like this one better than Arc of a Diver (unlistenable?!?) and Back in the High Life.  While I love Winwood in all his guises (Spencer Davis Group, Blind Faith, Traffic, etc), this album has always been my personal favorite.  Valerie (this version is much better than later one with revised drum track and vocals) and Still in the Game are the highlights for me (if you're of a certain age, you'll recall seeing the videos on MTV), although the ballads are also excellent.  I can't recall how many papers I wrote in high school and college with this album on repeat in the background.  The guy's talent is limitless.
0895260131|1.0|This book is just awful.  Its written from the perspective and motive of hate and anger.  How objective and fair can anyone be when they are angry or filled with such hatred?  And on top of that, I sense such fear, such insecurity and such paranoid.  Its a shame I had to give it even a star.  Ir you want to learn about Islam properly, read something like Martin Lings, Muhammad or Roger DuPasquier, Unveiling Islam.  Or get the Koran for Dummies or something like that.

0440237688|4.0|The Giver is captivating book about a lifestyle quite different from our own. Lois Lowry shows her incredible imagination and creativity in this story about Jonas, the main character, living a restricted life and proceeding to realize there is a better way to live.  <br /> <br />Before reading this book, I took my individuality for granted. While the story of The Giver is not true, it opened my eyes to a different and controlled way of life and made me realize how privileged I am to be able to make my own decisions. There are a lot of little things taken for granted in our world. Lois Lowry gives you a glimpse of what life would be like without them. <br /> <br />The Giver holds many twists, turns, and surprises. As you read about Jonas's life, you will find your feelings changing from happy, sad, and confused about the life this boy has to lead. You may find the lifestyle appalling or you might find it incredible.  <br /> <br />A key element in The Giver is the difference of opinions. Would you stand up for your beliefs even if it meant utter rejection from everyone you knew?

B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I'll be brief- this soundtrack is not the \\"normal\\"  sci-fi affair- it feels more like a anthropological study of music, from \\"tribal\\" to ancient European with elements of Oceania, Africa, America (again, ancient), and Asia mixed in.  With track 30, for example, my friend thought it was Chinese, but I'm thinking more Italian- of course, half way through, it become a more primal song... <br /> <br />If you're looking here, its for one of four reasons- you like/love the show, you're been directed by friends/family, you like superb and original music, or you misclicked.  In either event: <br /> <br />1st reason)  Buy the CD <br />2nd reason)  Buy the CD, and ask to borrow the DVD set from the person who recommended the show to you, (before you get it yourself) <br />3rd reason)  This is it- this will be one of the best CDs you get this year.  (But give the show a chance- best show on TV in several years) <br />4th reason)  Seriously, you should try the series- the 1st Season DVDs come with the pilot miniseries, and if you don't like Sci-Fi, don't worry- you don't have to: great storytelling is great storytelling, regardless of the genre. <br /> <br /> <br />I've had the CD about two weeks now, and I've listened to the whole track, end to end, at least fifty times, (not to mention the repeating of certain tracks).  My friends and family who've heard it, regardless of them watching the show, want this CD, (and they range from Vietnamese to Nigerian, not to mention American).  (Plus, its a good thing I have both DVD sets, as they're both borrowed out...)  This CD will not disappoint, should you like something better than the current pop music media we have now.   <br /> <br /> <br />So say we all.
B000059HB7|5.0|A typical Western with John Wayne and George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes. <br />I had forgotten how good it was when it first came out. <br />Highlights with Rick Nelson, and Dean Martin singing also. <br />What more can you ask for- comedy, drama, a dab of violence <br />and good triumphs over evil in the end.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is a GREAT DVD and not just because the Eagles are my favorite group.  It was well done, with lots and lots of their songs.  Every one is a favorite - even the new ones.  I saw them during this tour and hope they just keep going.

B000BKJ78K|1.0|This is just another excuse to by Lucasfilm make Lucas some extra cash, This is exactly the same as previous release except a nicer cover(which will tempting to some fans), You dont even get the bonus disc, there are still glitches eg. Lightsaber faults which will not be fixed. and is blatant attempt to make extra cash out of the fans for Xmas,when the 2004 superior boxset has just been around and probably now taken off the shelfs if you want Star Wars on DVD go for the 4 disc set which you can pick in some places the same price and you get a bonus disc.

0312263120|4.0|There are a lot of negative reviews here... and some validity to them. Being in the IT profession for 13 years, I saw the techno-flaws as did some of the other reviewers... Some were quite comical, for instance; Greg Hale entering modified Fortran commands to interact directly with a running program. But all that aside, I thought the book was well written. I can't wait to read his other books. Good job Dan!

B00005JO0J|5.0|Just got back from watching Serenity.  We caught the first showing of the day, first day it was out.  Surprisingly we were in a good size theater and there were only six other people there to watch it.  Almost as private as watching it at home.  Hopefully the news of this movie will spread via word of mouth and the theaters will fill up some more.<br /><br />Gotta say, this was a very good movie.  Not just another TV quality episode, but a full blown movie quality show.  Unlike other sci-fi blockbusters from earlier in the summer that were disappointing, this one really delivers on both effects and story line.  The cast relationships have the same feel that they did in the dvd series, though Mal is somewhat darker, and even more dangerous, than he was on TV.  It even fills in some of the storyline holes that you were left hanging on after the 11th TV episode.<br /><br />If you like Firefly, definitly go see it.  If you like SciFi, definitly go see it.  If you like a good story, lots of action, good character interaction, clever scripting, go see it.  If you like \\"The Sound of Music\\", well you might not want to see this, its a little over the edge on the action for the grandmothers in the audience (unless your grandmother is like my grandmother and is a little over the edge herself!)<br /><br />Anyway, I just wanted to add to the word of mouth effort to spread the news about this movie.  I'd like to see the second movie come out ASAP.  Then the next TV series, then the game, then the action figure, then the...  You get the picture.  Go see this one.  Its definitly worth the price of admission.
B000059XUI|5.0|It's a typical day for Clark Kent, 2nd banana reporter for the Daily Planet newspaper, when Editor-In-Chief Perry White sends him to Paris, France to cover a story of terrorism at the Eiffel Tower. It's a typical day for Superman too, when the hostage situation involves a hydrogen bomb and the woman of his dreams, ace reporter Lois Lane. Superman makes short work of the explosive device, hurling it into space where it can do no harm. Little does he know that the subsequent explosion has released three of the most dangerous criminals in the history of the planet Krypton from their imprisonment within the Phantom Zone. The cruel and merciless General Zod and his disciples, the hateful Ursa and the mindless Non, after destroying a team of astronauts on the moon, immediately set their power-hungry sights on the meek and conquerable planet of Earth. Meanwhile, Earth's most dangerous criminal mind, Lex Luthor, plots a successful escape from the maximum security prison in which he is being held, and, following Superman's usual flight pattern, makes his way due north to discover the hero's secret layer and the details of his alien past.<br /><br />As the three Kryptonian criminals wreak havoc and revel in their new superhuman powers, Superman is preoccupied with Lois Lane, who has discovered that he and Clark are one in the same while investigating a story at Niagra Falls and posing as a honeymooning couple. It would appear that Superman is quite relieved to have someone to share his secrets with, especially since that someone is Lois. He quickly whisks her away to his Fortress of Solitude in the great, white north. While the Man of Steel completely opens up to his lady-love, Lex travels to the White House to converse with Earth's NEW leaders, and to give the three alien terrorists an offer they can't refuse! It seems like this would be the worst time ever for Superman to give up all his superpowers and become a regular, mortal man, but that's just what he does! Completely clueless as to what has transpired in the world outside his icy fortress, Superman declares to the soul of his deceased mother Lara that he loves the Earth woman, Lois. She reveals to him that he must forego all his superhuman abilities to be with her, and so he does.  It would seem that no one can stop the three criminals from Krypton now! And, with all the information Lex Luthor is providing them, they decide their next conquest will be the son of the man who imprisoned them in the Phantom Zone in the first place, Kal-El of Krypton, also known as Superman!<br /><br />After the world was wowed by the first Superman movie starring Christopher Reeve, the second one had a tall order to fill. With a change of directors after 2/3rds of the film had been shot, and various other powerful elements being lost that made the first film great, their was a fair possibility that the second outing would not go well. Luckily, the first film had set so much excellent groundwork, including lots of previously shot sequel footage by \\"Superman: the Movie\\" director Richard Donner, that a first Superman sequel would be hard to mess up. Yes, had Richard Donner stayed in the director's seat, the sequel would likely have been even better, but as it is, \\"Superman 2\\" is a highly enjoyable film with much of the magic and power of the original! The cast is fantastic, especially Christopher Reeve, with his outstanding skill at portraying both the powerful and confident Man of Steel and the meek and clumsy reporter, Clark Kent. Lois is played flawlessly by Margot Kidder, as are the 3 super-villains, Terence Stamp as Zod, Sarah Douglas as Ursa, and Jack O'Halloran as Non. Gene Hackman turns in another flawless and funny performance as Lex Luthor, criminal blowhard, and many other familiar faces return from \\"Superman: The Movie,\\" mostly due to the fantastic (and clearly superior) Richard Donner footage shot during the making of the original. The story this time around is much more about being Superman rather than becoming Superman, which places more focus on action and romance than touching Americana and family bonds, and for some that may make this one less appealing. However, for those fans waiting to see a good superhuman battle-royale, this picture delivers! This DVD edition, on the other hand, doesn't.  The only extras it offers are the theatrical trailer and a few filmographies. Nevertheless, until some Special Edition DVDs of the Superman sequels are released (probably to coincide with the release of next year's \\"Superman Returns\\"), this DVD is a must have! \\"Superman 2\\" is one of those sequels that is worthy of its place in a franchise beloved the world over!becoming Superman, which places more focus on action and romance than touching Americana and family bonds, and for some that may make this one less appealing.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Okay, I have only taken a semester of Japanese 1, so when I saw the Japanese version, I only understood bits and peices. EVen though I could only understand some of the dialogue, I still pretty much knew what was going on. It has become my new favorite movie. I'll be first in line to buy it for the American release. Who knows, I might even pre-order it off of this site. It's completely awesome.

You're probably thinking \\"what is this doing on a Stoner Rock Album?\\" but, if you listen closely, you'll find it very eerie and disturbing. Hell, it's about chasing a guy through the forest and eating him alive.<br /><br />I highly recomend this fantastic album, you won't be dissapointed
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I'll paraphrase another reviewer's comments by saying, if there's music in heaven, this must be it. After the dark and sombre ( ), Takk sails the other channel, joyous and childlike in its optimism. I just saw the band in concert and I was floored by their opening/backup group, the Amina String Quartet, who return on this album. The SR sound here mixes deep electronics with nurserylike toy piano and xylophone. No worries if you can't understand the lyrics; I think the boys from Iceland are happy enough if you let the music take you where it will. This album will make an equally breathtaking soundtrack for watching the sun set, the snow fall or the baby take its first steps. Matchless.
B0006399FS|5.0|\\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is just further proof that U2 can still crank out great music after over 2 decades together and will likely continue to do so for years to come. The hits are great but there are some other songs that keep playing over again in my stereo of a brain, for example Crumbs and One Step Closer. And anyone fortunate enough like me to see them live in concert should consider themselves lucky!
B00097DX3U|5.0|Before they had ever played a single note together, before they had released any music of any kind, Audioslave were already one of the coolest bands on the block. Three parts Rage Against The Machine mixed with one part Soundgarden, you just can't lose! Audioslave's debut was an instant hit for that reason. It gave us the best of both worlds, and gave fans of those bands something warm and nostalgic to listen to in an era of luke-warm grunge and garage rock. The debut was so explosive, and it almost never came out (due to troubles with each party's respective management and record labels), so the thought of a second album never really crossed anyone's mind. But here, less than three years later, Audioslave are back.<br /><br />\\"Out Of Exile\\" is definitely more experimental than the debut, and for that, it's a work that will probably have a lot more shelf life than it's predecessor. However, since it is so experimental and different than the first, it also just isn't as good. Let me take some time out to tell you that I have a very open mind and am not criticizing the band. Far from it. You're not gonna get the usual gripes outta me. I'm a huge fan of not only Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine, but Audioslave as well. The fact that they are tinkering with their sound is a good sign. If they had just recorded their debut all over again, it would have been tired. That's why this album gets five stars. Their debut is a hard thing to beat, but since they are finding a new sound for themselves, I am sure their third album will blow it completely away. As for \\"Out Of Exile,\\" it has many layers to it, therefore, if you don't like it on your first listen, just keep giving it a chance. It's a great album. Chris Cornell has really changed his attitude and style with his lyrics, as evidenced by the unusually sunny \\"Doesn't Remind Me,\\" and the uplifting anthem, \\"Be Yourself.\\" The band gives a more classic rock backdrop to his lyrics this time around, instead of the \\"Chris Cornell fronting Rage Against The Machine\\" sound that they had going before. There are traces of that sound here, witness \\"Drown Me Slowly\\" and \\"Your Time Has Come,\\" while \\"Heaven's Dead\\" and \\"Dandelion\\" are respectable 90's grunge throwbacks. I'd say every other song on here will sound familiar, while the ones in between will deliver you something you haven't quite heard before.<br /><br />Honestly, there are no bad songs on here, nothing to skip over. Some songs take more time than others (the singles are the easiest to click into) but they all wind up making a very intelligent and very cohesive rock album. If you came to this group as just a Rage Against The Machine fan, you're probably going to be put off quite a bit by this album. If you wanted the group to stick to the same sound, you will also be left in the dust. \\"Out Of Exile\\" is the band pushing ahead, making new music like no one's ever heard before. Don't disregard it just because it doesn't stick on the first listen, otherwise, you'll be missing out.is Cornell fronting Rage Against The Machine\\" sound that they had going before.

0767821920|5.0|Clint Eastwood, John Malcovich and Rene Russo head up a talented cast in \\"In The Line Of Fire\\", a tense, superbly written suspense thriller about a veteran Secret Service agent out to stop a pyscopath from murdering the leader of the Free World.<br /><br />For over thirty years, Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) has been the top dog in his field: always able, always alert, always willing to risk his life should harm come in the way of the President of the United States. But for years, he has been struggling to repress his memories of the past, for he was there on that fateful day of November 22nd, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Horrigan is ridden with guilt over not being able to save JFK. Those memories come back to haunt him when he gets a call from Mitch Leary (Malcovich), a brilliant pyschopath who lets Frank on a little secret: he's planning on killing the president. And he means it. Despite health issuses and ill feelings from his supervisors, Horrigan launches an all out war to find Leary, and stop him before he's too late. However, Leary manages to be one step ahead of Frank. To make matters worse, Frank has become romantically involved with Lily Raines (Rene Russo), a devastatingly beautiful fellow agent who's almost half his age. This all results in a tense and satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />This film is one of the best thrillers ever to hit the big screen. A must see movie.
B00004STPT|5.0|I know adding another review on top of the 344 that already exist is sort of superfluous, but if you want to know exactly how much of a genius Hans Zimmer is, turn on Track 13 of this CD and fast-forward to 9 minutes, 15 seconds.  It's just too bad you can't hear it on the one-minute link on this page--but then the price of the CD is absolutely worth just that forty-five seconds. It will knock your socks off (make tears come to your eyes, in my case).  So will the last track; if you cried at the end of the movie, just listening to the music from it will make you do the same.<br /><br />Gladiator 928 says below (or above, depending on where this gets posted) that the soundtrack is better than the movie.  Ehh... I'm a huge fan of the storyline... but for sure, the movie and the extradiagetic music are a perfect match.  The 2000 Oscar for Best Sound was given to this film, but honestly, it deserved Best Original Score.  Or at least Wickedest Awesome Brass and String Score Ever.
6305364648|5.0|Generally, Arnold Schwarzenegger's films are a hit or miss affair. However, thanks to a good script, dazzling special effects and a reunion with \\"Terminator\\" director James Cameron, the governator's 1994 vehicle \\"True Lies\\" turned out to be one of his best movies. In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's his best film outisde of the first two \\"Terminator\\" movies.<br /><br />Performance wise, this is Schwarzenegger at his best. He plays superspy Harry Tasker, who along with his partner Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold in a rare winning performance) work for a secret government organization known as Omega. However, to his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and his daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku), he's just an Average Joe who sells computer for a living. For 15 years, he's been able to keep his life a secret.<br /><br />For their next assginment, Harry and Albert are out to stop terrorist Salim Abu Aziz (played with scenery chewing finesse by well known character actor Art Malik), who has smuggled various explosives in hopes of laucnhing attacks across the U.S. Malik and his girlfriend Juno Skinner (Tia Carerre) always manage to be one step ahead of Tasker. Then, to make matters more complicated, Harry learns that his wife is having an affair with a man named Simon (Bill Paxton). This leads to several intrigung twists and turns, many of them often hilarious but mostly filled with nonstop action.<br /><br />\\"True Lies\\" is a fast paced, red blooded action movie that belongs in anyone's dvd collection.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|I berate myself for waiting ten odd years after I heard of these guys for buying an album.  After twenty years of being an on-again, off-again prog fan (to be \\"prog\\" is an ambivalent phenomenon in this world!), I broke down and checked these guys out.  Know what?  There has never been an album like this by any band.  This captures a band at the height of their powers and emotions.  Peter Hammill sounds like he's going to crawl into your skin.  David Jackson is the Rahsaan Roland Kirk of rock.  Millions upon millions of people who think they know rock (including myself) have been missing out on something without comparison for years and years now (with the exception of the Italians and the French who propelled this to number one in their countries in the day).<br /><br />If you are a progressive rock fan, you will lose your mind over this one.  As good as anything King Crimson ever did, if not better.  A whole different experience than Yes (the lyrics are about obsession instead of transcendence, the music fit-inducing instead of euphoria-inducing).  They share the prolonged keyboard excursions of ELP, but Hammill & Co. actually do free jazz whereas ELP were a little too \\"polished\\" for that.  Jethro Tull, Genesis, Hawkwind . . . all the bigger prog names.  _Pawn Hearts_ surpasses most anything any of them ever did.<br /><br />I've bought three other of their albums on an impulsive week-long spree.  None of them live up to the manic magic of this one, but still VDGG will stick in your head no matter what you hear of them.  They are completely their own entity.
B000AL730O|4.0|this record's been on heavy rotation in my kitchen since i picked up the CD a week or so ago, and when i don't have it on the melodies are still rotating, involuntarily, in my head. it's true this is the best mccartney album in a long time, due partly to producer nigel godrich, and partly to paul playing almost all the instruments himself. the all-instruments thing must have lent the sessions an air of experimentation, which made the songs less predictable than they might have been had he been playing with his touring band. the bass playing is as good as ever, and i like the way he uses the piano as a precussive instrument: this saves the song Fine Line, and the sound appears elsewhere too, to good effect. <br />   i give the album 4 instead of 5 stars because there are some throwaways. i really don't like English Tea -- it's an attempt to kick out something charming in the style of Martha My Dear, which is itself too cute but rescued by a great piano solo, which English Tea doesn't have. besides, Martha was about a real dog, and English Tea is about nothing. the songs Follow Me and Gave My Promise to you Girl don't have enough interesting to them to stand up. Fine Line he apparently chose for a single, but it's too safe; it's some peppy nothingness. A Certain Softness is also too dull, pretty cheesy, despite a nice beatles-reminiscent turn in the melody.  <br />   i've just written off half the album. but the other half is great!  <br />   How Kind of You is a great, moody and beautifully honest love song, and as paul's lyrical style goes these lyrics are good. It, like the long piece Vanity Fair, suprised me because I don't usually enjoy paul's (recent) built-up, heavily produced numbers. these are well-organized and not too glossy. the song Anyway will be popular with fans of wings tracks like Love in Song. Friends to Go -- too corny to play for your friends, this song will root in your head and demand repeated playings before it will go away. Same with Too MuchRain. Finally, Jenny Wren is brilliant: acoustic and minor, it's a lovely, delicate song until pedro eustache's duduk comes in, and then it becomes a perfect, almost spooky elegy.  <br />   paul! you've done it. these songs are so good. i can find good tracks on almost all of mccartney's records, and love the early solo ones (mccartney, ram, venus & mars, parts of wild life) but was not expecting to be so pleased again. worth getting, for certain.

B00005JO0J|5.0|I've had the privilege of seeing Serenity with my husband not just once, but TWICE -- once at a sneak preview several weeks ago, and again at a special midnight showing for the Browncoats in the Denver area prior to the movie's premiere here.<br /><br />Having said that, I can't begin to tell everyone how highly I recommend this movie.  Set in the future, Serenity picks up about where its predecessor (the short-lived, but much-loved, sci-fi/Western series Firefly) left off, weaving a tale that is rich and complex, bound to snare both fans and non-fans alike.  Written and directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel series creator Joss Whedon, Serenity brings back the entire cast of regulars from Firefly: Nathan Fillion as Capt. Mal Reynolds; Gina Torres as Zoe; Alan Tudyk as Zoe's husband, Wash; Morena Baccarin as Inara; Jewel Staite as ship's mechanic Kaylee; Sean Maher as doctor-turned-fugitive Simon Tam; Summer Glau as Simon's sister, River; Adam Baldwin as Jayne; and Barney Miller's Ron Glass as Shepherd Book.  I am pleased to know that all of the Firefly regulars chose to come back for Serenity; had they declined, the film would have been nowhere as good as the series, and I would have been even less inclined to watch it.<br /><br />All in all, I have to say that Joss did a wonderful job with Serenity.  It's one of the best genre films I've seen since Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and it's going to be one of those that anyone will want to see again and again.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|This is an incredible new album by the greatest Canadian rocker of all time.  This album sounds a lot like Harvest and Harvest Moon but I can honestly say that it's 100 times better than both of them put together.  The production is amazing, I was suprised that Kanye West didn't produce these tracks, they are so slick and deep.  Neil...you are like a fine wine, you keep getting better and better with age.  It would be cool if you teamed up with Snoop or 50 Cent and did a remix of The Painter, a great song.  If you don't own this CD hurry up and go buy it!!!
B00005JO0J|4.0|At last the wait is over. \\"Firefly\\" fans the world over can look forward to the fun of revisiting their characters in their BIG screen incarnation, having many of their answers solved, and to more trademark Joss Whedon storytelling trickery alternately misleading or revealing various unexpected plot twists - and gags. It's all good fun. What's more, unlike most movie style sci-fi our (anti)heroes are given room to emote, develop and demonstrate real responses to the dangers that face them.    I went with a couple of similar \\"Firefly\\" fanatics, like me eager to see how the story trail would be picked up. We all walked away feeling very satisfied. (I could swear that my  friend Bryant, sitting immediately to my right in the dark, shed a few tears - there were telltale sniffles.)     For myself, I walked away feeling that Joss Whedon is a real gift to genre based story telling. He really knows how to milk the drama just enough for effect, when to get things moving and when (and how!) to remind us of the personal cost to our protagonists of the events into which they have been swept. I actually cared for these people, quite a feat when you consider that there are nine carefully deliniated central characters and assorted unsavoury people in whom to invest; the whole thing was so much more than eye candy - unlike the vast majority of space operas.    Why not five stars? My other \\"Firefly\\" buddy Nathan and I in the car on the drive home felt that perhaps Whedon's real skills are best expressed in the more expansive format provided by series television - churlish really, when we were supremely lucky to get this much. (Not that we are not thankful!) But there's something... maybe a little too much exposition, though this was very cleverly done! (How does all this information come across to someone unfamiliar with the series?) I can't escape  the feeling that the revelations to which we were treated would have so much more effective in the TV series format. Can you imagine waiting breathlessly for next week's installment with a story like this one, built up deliberately over months of careful plotting and preparation?     Is there the possibility of a new series? (Six shooters, sex and special efects - one can only dream!)    Still, it's great entertainment, and I'll be in the cinemas again in the next few days to see it again.     I predict sniffles.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I bought this CD for the song \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times,\\" which I'd read about in a review/analysis by Shannon Brown on The Ten Tenors website. The intro to the first song, \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" reminded me immediately how much I had liked this song years ago. Most of these songs were new to me because I just wasn't paying attention before. For someone who likes unique use of musical sounds and ideas, this set of songs is truly satisfying. There is wonderful use of strings in \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder),\\" absolutely wonderful. I've listened to this over and over again. There is an instrumental, called \\"Pet Sounds,\\" that brings something new to hear each time I listen. Masterful through and through.

B00005JO0J|5.0|I just finished watching Serenity with a huge audience, which surprised me on a Friday at 1:00. I was thrilled to see so many people there, and they, like me, laughed , cried and cheered,all during this wonderful movie. I have to admit, I went in expecting something great, I am a huge Joss Whedon fan. I was not let down....I was surprised that the USA newspaper only gave it two stars...I didn't know what to think when I read that, now I know...they were WRONG.... <br />This is a GREAT movie, I am ready to see it again. It is a must, and if you are not familiar with the Firefly television show, it won't matter, Mr.Whedon did a great job with that, this is for eveyone.

0446677450|4.0|I picked this up, largely because my business school graduate brother had read it. I'm working on getting my financial house in order, and I was hoping this book would be a good basic intro to some approaches for increasingly my wealth that were consistent with my values of discipline. While I got some good ideas, the tone of this book was not totally appealing to me, and I question some of the specific suggestion he makes.<br /><br />Some reviewers have attacked Kiyosaki as a fraud and one of the current spotlight reviews even has a link to a website that believes Kiyosaki made this whole thing up to make money. Even if Kiyosaki made up this story, the parable of a positive financial model in contrast to a poor parental financial role model is a powerful, accessible idea that has spurred this book's success. Many readers here the ideas that Rich Dad gives Mike and Kiyosaki and find themselves nodding their heads. The philosophy of sacrificing entertainment at an early age, working for peanuts to get experience, and investing in assets over liabilities are the types of basic truths that much of Kiyosaki's audience needs to hear. Just look at our current love affair with credit cards. It's easy to see that a man who can give a message to attack financial appetites and build wealth can find a popular audience.<br /><br />For me personally, this book was simple  but it did provide me with some helpful ideas. The two big ones for me were that Kiyosaki considers a first home to be a liability rather than an asset due to the large chunks of capital it ties up and that Kiyosaki considers intellectual property an asset.<br /><br />Sadly, much of this book does not focus on sound financial advice, but wanders into the realm of speculative real estate and speculative investing. Even worse, there's a lack of compassion in many of his attitudes. He believes that the government should not tax citizens significantly and that tax laws have unfairly squeezed out the middle class. This is true to an extent. But I hope Kiyosaki would not be one of those who believes that those who suffer tragedy should not be able to call on the government for support. There's also an attitude that those in the \\"rat race\\" are fools who are duped into working hard. While I think that many people make tragic financial choices, his message might be easier to swallow if he spent less time putting down people who don't dig his advice.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm struck by the strong opinions that have been aroused by this book. Folks either believe this will make them millionaires or that the man is a total fraud. The truth is probably in the middle. There are a few positive ideas here, and it might wake you up a little bit. If you're an experienced financial planner, accountant, or investor, you will probably find this either too basic or too shoddy a treatment.<br /><br />I'm not a believer, but I'm not a hater either.<br /><br />--SD<br /><br />--3 starsass.

0316234753|5.0|I loved this book when I was a kid, and when my mom found my mangled copy, I was so excited to pass it along to my children.  My son (5) loved the step by step directions, and was able use them to build confidence.
B000AMPZGC|5.0|There are tons of awesome and endearing soundtracks from films that have touched our hearts over the years. Simply from the songs sung to the score. After watching the Corpse Bride with some friends recently, I was immediately drawn into the brillance and elegance of this great soundtrack!  <br /> <br />Danny Elfman did an excellent job overall with different songs and score, with each song matching the mood of each scene in the movie really well.  <br /> <br />This is by far a definite buy indeed! This is far superior to the Nightmare Before Christmas (both in music and movie in my opinion) in a lot of ways.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|When I first looked at Avenged Sevenfold's look and read their stage names, I laughed my head off.  Long an indie favorite and now making a breakthrough on a major label, I mistakingly categorized Avenged Sevenfold with the current crop of metal pretenders like Atreyu, Trivium, etc.  Then I decided to give these guys a listen, and once you get past their schtick, you'll discover that there is some great hard rock/metal here.  Lead single \\"Bat Country\\" (supposedly inspired by the late Hunter S. Thompson's tripped out Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) isn't anything real special, but opening track \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" isn't only catchy and melodic, but it has possibly one of the most well played and catchy bridges and harmonies in recent memory.  Other tracks, including \\"Trashed & Scattered\\" and \\"Seize the Day\\", display some great duel guitar wizardry, which is refreshing in the mainstream metal scene considering the last few years were nothing but hip-hop beats and downtuned guitars.  \\"City of Evil\\" isn't perfect, and a majority of it is too mainstream aimed for hardcore fans of old metal like Pantera, Slayer, Morbid Angel, etc., but it's a welcome surprise in the metal world today.  All in all, if you've never checked out Avenged Sevenfold, give \\"City of Evil\\" a try.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a MUST have, if you like science fiction, and are a fan of space \\"rogues\\" like Han Solo!  The cast is outstanding, the sets are marvelous, the special effects are beautiful, and the ambience is rogueish.  The only problem is knowing that once you finish the last DvD, there is no more to take in.  Enjoy!
B00005JNTX|4.0|i just finished watching this movie and let me tell you it was something else!theres near naked chicks the whole way through which wouldve kept me going right there,but then theres lots of blood and guts too!talk about double prizes!it is black and white mostly which im sure a lot of people will whine about,but a lot of good movies are black and white so dont be so stupid!there is color in certain parts,which is neat.one thing i did not like was how the characters are shot repeatedly or lethaly[at least debilitatingly] and are up and fighting in like 30 seconds.did i miss something?do they regenerate?bulletts only hurt a little bit?its very grapgicly violent and not for you hippie bleeding heart liberalistsw out there,so go watch dazed and confused for the millionth time and leave your protest groups to something worth fighting over.the movie is masterfully directed by quenten tarantino.so you know theres a lot of blood and guts in it!theres more than one creepy part so i suggest only those with a good tolerance for violence and lifetime type drama go see it.its a cool movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is very well made, I admire the aura Radiohead gives off.  Not one of hope, but not one of despair.  Brilliant.  And to those who feel us Radiohead fans are being the kid that worships the abstract because it perfectly describes our thirst for understanding... you know you're wrong, and you knew you were wrong when you wrote that.  If we wanted that, we would have wrote reviews for simple plan, but of course we didn't.  Radiohead fans are past this stage of \\"understanding\\".  We don't look for comfort in miseducation, we look for comfort in music.  Real, sensible, sculpted music.  Keep looking for excuses, we'll keep laughing.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Matt Damon returns to the screen as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac CIA assassin who can still remember how to kick your ass even if you have a semi-automatic weapon and he doesn't, and who somehow hasn't forgotten how to drive five-foot-wide vehicles really fast down three-foot-wide alleys. <br /> <br />This episode opens with very a cool chase scene through a resort town on the coast of India. Thirty-something Jason, accompanied by frightened Euro-trash girlfriend Maria (the sometimes hot-sometimes not Franka Potente) drives his jeep off a bridge to escape from a Russian mercenary killer, and survives by holding his breath underwater for about an hour. Maria's not so lucky, and fails to respond to Jason's selfless mouth-to-mouth attempts to save her life with his three or four remaining air molecules. For most guys that kind of loss would be a major setback, but amnesia does have its upside (\\"Maria who?\\"). Hitting the road again, Bourne follows a trail of death and duplicity to Naples, Berlin, and Moscow, just one of which, it appears to this American stay-at-home, might be worth visiting, while the other two would not, not even for an overnight quickie with Cameron Diaz. In Berlin (which in this movie's rendering would take a week's supply of zoloft just to get to merely depressing) Jason plays a neat game of cat-and-mouse with a half-dozen CIA and Justice biggies who are out to shut him up, for reasons that may cause you to want to bring out the Roget's and look up \\"contrived\\" or maybe \\"insipid\\". Joan Allen as a steamy over-forty blonde Section Head will not remind you in any way of Janet Reno, trust me, but she won't remind you of Albert Einstein either, if you know what I mean. Here's an example: with about three thousand of her agents looking for Bourne, he is able to evade them by checking into the biggest hotel in Germany under the alias \\"Jason Dourne\\". OK, I made that up, but it's not far off. <br /> <br />When Bourne finally discovers (or rediscovers) the truthabout his own role in a years-ago assassination attempt gone awry, he heads to Moscow to deliver the absolute ballsiest apology in movie history. Like the decent guy he is, Bourne doesn't even attempt to fall back on the Steve Martin \\"I forgot\\" defense, which of course would have been very believable under the circumstances. I'm not telling you any more about this, except to say that the Russian babe from whom he begs forgiveness makes Anna Kournikova look like Lyle Lovett. <br /> <br />Just as in The Bourne Identity, Damon's mien is pretty mono-dynamic---he's more android than human---but it's pretty hard to be too judgmental about a guy who can't even come up with the answer to any of the standard password-protection questions (Mother's maiden name? Uh...). Nonetheless, it's fun to watch him outwit the morons, even if it makes you wonder more than you already do about the quality of our agencies. All in all..... <br /> <br />RECOMMENDED
B00005T5YK|3.0|I was expecting more sound channel diferentiation as a DVD Audio. It's not bad but for me is as a normal CD.
1573226521|4.0|The Beach is a very good book.  You just can't put it down. I would highly recommend it.
B00005JNY4|5.0|Paul Walker plays Jared, a down on his luck, head in the clouds scuba diver looking for that treasure that will get him out of his financial slump.  <br />Jessica Alba portrays Sam, Jared's girlfriend, a treasure who, in real life, would have dumped him a long time ago.  <br />During one of their dives with Jared's brother (portrayed by Scott Caan) and his girlfriend of the week Amanda (played by Sharon Stone wannabe Ashley Scott), they find pieces of a treasure from a sunken ship.   <br />Exploring a little further, they also find a crashed plane with 80 kilos of cocaine in it.  <br />For those going to this movie for the Jessica Alba factor, you won't be disappointed.  The first half hour is about 10% plot and 90% every camera angle possible of Jessica's body, especially her butt, which seems to be on a diet of bikini bottoms.  I was waiting for a woman in the audience to say, \\"Okay!  We get it!  She's hot!\\".  :)  <br />The cinematography is awesome.  The plot and action build up very nicely throughout the movie.  It's slightly predictable but still a good movie.  <br />The one thing I don't agree with is the rating.  In my opinion, this movie should be rated R not PG-13 because of the blood n guts violence and sexual content (without there actually being sex in the movie).  <br />Movie Warnings: profanity, major eye candy (for men and women), partial nudity, bootilisciousness, violence, crotch kick, crotch bite, sharks' human happy meals, some ridiculous lengths of time underwater without an oxygen tank, and a high level of jealousness (by the audience during the make-out scenes).  <br />Aside from the rating disagreement, it's worth the day and night time prices.  <br />Enjoy!  <br />
B000002C25|5.0|Remember 1997? Oasis were at their zenith, Be Here Now was about to go on sale and the hype machine went into overdrive. Be Here Now quickly went onto break records becoming the fastest selling British album of all time and peaked at number 2 in The States. So where did it all go wrong?    On the albums release, the music press at large universally praised the album. However, with the passing of time, the album, the crowning glory of Brit Pop, was dethroned by capricious critics. The media backlash begun, Be Here Now was critically plundered and lost beneath a tidal wave of hype.    BE HERE NOW EXHUMED, RESPUN AND EMBRACED. Be Here Now possesses depth, exuberance and swagger in abundance. There simply isn't a weak track on the album. `Stand By Me' is ultimate pub rock, `Dya Know What I Mean' is dark, brooding Rock at its triumphant best. `All Around The World' is celebratory and uplifting.    Be Here Now is the ultimate fans favourite. So much so a petition, signed by hundreds in its opening week, has been promoted across the web to be presented to the band later this year. Fan's are campaigning to restore tracks from this \\"lost classic\\" to the live set.     THE BE HERE NOW PETITION - ITS GETTING BETTER (MAN!!!)    [...]
B00003CXBK|5.0|If you like adventure movies, than you got to buy this movie.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|I had read in other reviews that the special effects and sound track were spectacular, I would say marginal.  This movie was horrible I want my $4 rental fee back.  The plot, writing and acting were all so bad that they would not have been able to be saved by even the best special effects and 5.1 sound track.  Don't waste your time on this disaster.
B00005JO0J|5.0|As the Fall 2005 television season rolls around, fans of Joss Whedon's critically acclaimed hit series Firefly are eagerly awaiting the fourth season premiere.  If only that were true.  Back in 2002, Whedon, the creator of cult hits Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spin-off series Angel, brought a new science fiction show to FOX that was unlike nearly every other sci-fi show ever seen (parallels have been drawn to Cowboy Bebop and the original Battlestar Galactica, but we'll ignore those for now).  Firefly mixed two television genres that one would think could never mesh: sci-fi and the western.  And yet Joss pulled it off.  The show had great writing, amazing character development (and with nine principal characters, that isn't easy), and compelling stories.  But, with all that going for it, the show was cancelled after only 11 episodes aired.  Ratings were low, and FOX did very little to help the struggling series.  Things should have ended there.  But they didn't.  About a year later, FOX released the entire series (including three unaired episodes) on DVD, which turned out to be a very wise decision. The set sold millions of copies.  Many people who had never seen the show at all before buying the set (myself included) bought it anyway due to positive publicity and admiration for Whedon's other work.  We bought the set.  We showed it to our friends.  Our friends bought the set.  Eventually, Universal Studios took notice of the success of this cancelled series, and so they bought the movie rights to the series.  They got Joss to write and direct the movie, and they even got all nine actors to reprise their roles for the film.  How's that for fan support?  Six months after the events of the Firefly finale, \\"Objects In Space\\", a few things have changed aboard the firefly class transport Serenity.  Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Shepard Deria Book (Ron Glass) have left the ship.  River (Summer Glau) has begun going on missions with Captain Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion), Jayne (Adam Baldwin) and Zoe (Gina Torres), much to her brother Simon's (Sean Maher) chagrin.  River is a \\"reader\\" as Mal calls her; she can read others thoughts and sense danger, which makes her a powerful asset for thieves like Mal and his crew.  Apparently, things haven't been going well for the crew of Serenity.  Pieces of the ship are falling off, making flying it tough, even for an experienced pilot such as Wash (Alan Tudyk), and Kaylee (Jewel Staite), Serenity's engineer, is having trouble keeping the ship in working order.   What's worse, Simon and River are still fugitives on the run from the Alliance, and it seems like the Alliance is getting desperate to get the pair back.  They have enlisted the aid of an Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a nameless agent of the Alliance who is used for the most important and classified missions.  He is a perfect agent; he does not let emotion get in the way of his objectives, he is skilled in martial arts, fencing, and marksmanship, and will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission.  If it wasn't bad enough that Mal and the crew had an enemy hunting them from the outside, River continues to become more and more unstable and dangerous.  Out of nowhere, she goes on a rampage in a bar, beating anyone who came near her into unconcisousness, even her friends from Serenity.  Finally, the Reavers, which are a group of people driven insane from being in space for too long without human contact, are becoming more and more visible.  Once the stuff of legends, they are making their existence apparent to the citizens of the solar system.  Serenity displays Whedon's trademark wit and knack for storytelling.  The film successfully answers many questions left in the air from the end of the series (while leaving many others to be addressed in future films).  Not only that, but the answers make perfect sense (from what I've heard, Joss planned out seven seasons of Firefly before the first even aired, and the movie takes us through the end of the second season).  Furthermore, the Operative is one of the best villains I've seen in a long time.  He is smart, dangerous, and ruthless.  Yet he has no delusions as to what he does, a trait very rare in film and television villains.  As to Whedon's wit, while this movie is definitely a drama, there are many hilarious lines throughout the movie, as well as a few things that poke fun at the science fiction genre.  It has been a grueling year and a half waiting for this movie to be released, but the wait has been worth it.  This is without a doubt the best movie I've seen this year.  While 2005 hasn't had a lot a great films, the few amazing ones have been just that, amazing.  Serenity is definitely the best on a short list of great films this year, and while it isn't the most hyped movie of the year, it is the best, and I truly think that is has potential to be the sleeper hit of the year.  Fans will love this movie because, while we would much rather have waited three months for the fourth season as opposed to one and a half years for this film, this movie is worth every penny paid for theater admission.  It will remind us why we fell in love with these characters and the universe they live in.  It will give us answers to questions we have been dying to hear, and it's just plain fun.  Non-fans will be drawn in by the quality of writing, acting, and effects.  Now that Star Wars is over, people will be looking for the \\"next big thing\\", and this could possibly be it (I feel that is superior to Star Wars in pretty much every way, especially the new trilogy).   Even people who aren't sci-fi fans should see this movie, because believe me when I say that it is that good.  It's kind of strange; the theme of the show was about people trying to get by in life without restraint.  In reality, this show was unjustly killed way before its time, yet its fans are now getting to experience it again due to their own actions.  The theme song was right, they can't take the skies from us.
1586210912|5.0|Great book.  Very well narrarated.  He didn't say It was too late for me, but I wish I had heard this sooner.  Part way through the disc, my wife said, \\"I don't like him.\\"  That's because his message was getting through loud and clear.  We're definitely going to make some changes in our decision making process.  My daughter (17) heard parts of it (when she was trapped in the car with us).  I'm going to play it through again on our next long car trip.  Thanks Robert.

0066620996|4.0|The greatest strength of this book, for me, is its demonstration that CEOs don't need to be visionaries to be effective, that they can be modest facilitators, in effect, who draw ideas for new strategic directions out of their teams by asking them challenging questions. My only complaint is that Collins calls this ''level 5 leadership''. We used to identify leadership with providing direction. The reality in Good to Great businesses is that CEOs stimulate leadership in others by asking provocative questions. For me this is a form of management defined as a coaching, facilitative activity. To call this ''level 5 leadership'' shows how deeply committed we are to seeing CEOs as leaders so long as they are effective, no matter what they do. Collins applauds his CEOs for facing reality but he himself does not face the reality that leadership might be bottom-up in some organizations where the CEO operates more as a coach, catalyst or facilitator than as a leader. Surely facilitation is facilitation, not leadership except in the obvious sense that the person in charge of the team is doing it. Collins recognizes that today's organizations are too complex to be driven in a top down manner, but he does not see the implication of this fact - that leadership is inexorably moving downwards in organizations as surely as leadership moves away from military generals in guerrilla warfare.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Wonderful concert!  I saw this performance on PBS last month.  A must for everyone to view and listen to.
B00005JNTX|5.0|If you like beautiful women, good dialogue, kick-ass action sequences, and an insane depth of actors giving awsome performances than chances are you will like this movie. Sure some of the scenes are a little much, for instance Hardigan ripping off parts of the human annatomy that makes most men cringe. Being based on Frank Millers graphic novels, and by graphic I mean it in every sense of the word, you are going to see some ultra-violence, but the gore and blood are bearable due to the films color scheme, and the rest is left to ones own twisted imagination. For the people who identify Elijah Wood with the friendly hobbit from the Shire be prepared for a whole knew range of his acting ability. His haunting performance alone is 5 stars. Don't bring the jeolouse girlfriend to the movie, the women on screen demand all the attention. Enjoy.
0307276902|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it to anyone, and I have , actually before Oprah did! However the only advice I would give is not to read the back of the book where James gives you a run down on what happens to everyone we meet in the book after they leave Rehab, the reason being the following book \\" My Friend Leonard\\" which continues on from when James leaves rehab was equally wonderful and luckily I am over 50 and so didn't remember all of what the updates had said so it didn't ruin it for me.  It was also a fast and fabulous read, I also highly recommend this second book. I just love the way he writes.
B0007P3582|1.0|Well i could go on for days about how much i disliked this CD as well as anything else 50 does but ill keep it as breif as i can. With this album you get more of the same, same beats, same themes to the tracks, why does Canyshop and magic stick sound exactly alike? With the panphlet inside you get some nice pictures of 50 pointing guns at your face, that's always nice. The fact that this album had so much commercial success is what really perplexes me though. Have we lost touch of what hip-hop was, it used to be about peace and stopping the violence witnessed around them, battling with a microphone not a pistol. We must move forward and this album is 3 strides back.
B000002GQG|5.0|It's hard to pick the best MB's album They are all good but if I had to rate them after giving it more thought I would place them in this order best to least best (which is still great).  1. IN SEARCH OF A LOST CHORD  2. ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM 3. SEVENTH SOJOURN   4.  A QUESTION OF BALANCE  5.  TO OUR CHILDERN'S CHILDREN'S CHILDREN  6.  EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR    7.  DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED
B00005ARDC|4.0|At first listen I wasn't pleased, I thought i just wasted $16, but i figured since I did pay for it and it did come recommended I would go over it again. While some of the songs are still annoying for me to listen to, their sound is a little monotonous at times, but soon I started to dig their sound and can enjoy most of this album. Track 3 and 4 are both good, good enough to make me go and see them live in Boston, which rocked really hard. So don't be so quick to judge, they deserve a few plays though.
0385474547|5.0|Really interesting book. easy to read. Got the book pretty quickly after purchasing it. great seller. will buy from again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Browsing an online forum one day, I came across a trailer for a new movie: Serenity.  \\"Awesome Trailer!\\"  I thought... <br /> <br />I had never before heard of Joss Whedon, and wasn't a Buffy / Angel fan at all, but decided to give this series a try based on a friend's recommendation. <br /> <br />I wasn't disappointed.  The characters are all very beliveable and like-able.  The plot takes many twists that you wouldn't expect, and the witty humor throughout the show never fails to bring a smile or a chuckle. <br /> <br />Now Im looking forward to seeing the movie \\"Serenity\\". <br /> <br />If you have $30 that you won't miss too terribly, definately give this series a try.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the greatest album ever made.  Radiohead is an amazingly inventive band with everything they do musically, and OK Computer is the pinnacle of recorded music.  Even being almost ten years old, it is still light years ahead of its time.  The experimentation they put into this; the far-reaching electronic ambience, Yorke's sorrowful pseudo-falsetto, everything about OK Computer is sheer brilliance.  It is impossible to praise this album enough.  For those who have listened to it and don't quite get it, I beg you; please give it a few listens before you dismiss it.  It is life-changing.  It will change the way you look at, well, everything.  It's hard for me to pick out favorite songs on here, since I like everything, but I'd have to say my favorites are Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Let Down, and Karma Police.  The lyric that sums OK Computer up for me is from Let Down:  \\"...one day, I am gonna grow wings...a chemical reaction...hysterical and useless...hysterical and - let down and hangin' around...\\"
B0000009XP|5.0|What can one say really?  If you like more polished or traditional blues from Buddy then this might not be the release for you.  If you want to hear Buddy guy with a great backing band (including his brother Phil) let loose in the studio, improvising lyrics and extending the songs....THIS IS IT.  Its one of his best release with some serious guitar!  I love this record, thank you Buddy (it beats the hell out of his new one...Bring em in....that is just bad-see my review).
B00005JO0J|3.0|I just got back from the first showing in my area on opening day. I am proud to report that Serenity is a pretty good movie - not great, just pretty good. It gives the audience a reason to like the characters and care about what happens to them, which is something that all 14 episodes of Firefly completely failed to do. However, it tries to do so by playing the same few cards over and over, and constantly hearing the same old things being said gets tiresome. The story is very tightly told and has many very clever plot points. It also has some noticeable gaps and contrivances for the sake of convenience. The humor, of course, is very much Joss Whedon's uniquely brilliant brand, but as with Firefly, it's not abundant. The action sequences, though cool, aren't very original; one scene felt like a ripoff of the opening space battle in Revenge of the Sith, while the scene where River fights a horde of Reavers was too much like the Smith-Neo brawl in The Matrix Reloaded. Though flawed and sometimes a bit weak, Serenity is never boring, and overall the good things about it outweigh the bad.
B000AOJ9X0|3.0|Ok let me start by saying \\"I love Buddy Guy\\"...I do, he is just one of the greatest living blues legends.  I have seen him numerous times, fan for years etc. etc.   I don't want to upset the other reviewers of this album, but five stars?  Come on now.  Buddy Guys studio recordings have always suffered from gross inconsistency....its the truth.  So here we have yet another, middle of the road CD.  The production is just to polished and so is the backing band (yes I love Steve Jordan too...but its just not a match).  The songs are lackluster and Buddy struggles to bring life to the song choices and guest stars....and do we really need guest stars to boost Buddy Guy (tracy Chapman? not a good match)  No way!  Now I gave it three stars and not two because Buddys guitar tone is still amazing and his singing is excellent as well and not phoned in.  For those looking to get a great, current Buddy Guy CD look elsewhere, try Sweet Tea or Slippin in or live real deal....even Damn right I've got the blues.  BUT LETS NOT MISLEAD FANS....WE ALL LOVE BUDDY GUY, BUT THIS RECORD IS NOT THE TRUE BUDDY.  So Buddy I hope you read this, know that I am a true fan....but please, somebody just let Buddy go into a studio with his touring band....ease up on the slick production and let this guy do his thing!  no guest stars!!!  (check out Stone Crazy, The Best of the Chess years, playing the blues w/Junior Wells).  Don't be misslead, this is a dud.  Sorry Buddy. (SIDE NOTE: Occasionally guest stars work, Hubert Sumlin's about those shoes CD is a great, BB kings Playing with my friends CD great! -avoid BB King's duets CDand the new BB cd \\"80\\" like the plague!, also Junior wells come on in this house cd is awesome)    (appartently Albert thinks that Buddy Guy is perfect, sorry dude even Buddy Guy- and yes I know his genius - can make mistakes, Albert you didn't even listen to the CD and yet you gave it 5 stars, is that helpful? I want Buddy to keep making music, and yes I am glad he is aroundstill to enjoy, but the purpose of REVIEWS is to give your opinion on the actual release so other buyers can get a feel for the product. Chill out, this CD is a dud, regardless if Hendrix worshipped Buddy or not.  Now Bandit is offended, what can I say, I love Buddy Guy, but I can admit when things are bad....Have you seen Buddy live?  Does he not blow this record away bandit?  come on man!  For the record I LOVE sweet tea as well....if you read my full review you would know that. Finally for the \\"Dave Truth\\" reviewer, I know Stone Crazy is not a chess release, thus the comma to indicate as such example: Stone Crazy, The Chess years....etc etc.  I was naming several releases. And STone Crazy was recorded in 1979.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is hip hop in it's rawest form, this 93 debut from the Wu-tang clan is easily one of the best hip hop albums period, this came out during a time when new york were losing their battle to LA thanks to super producer Dr Dre and the chronic album, but these nine MC'S from Shaolin staten Island came with that undiluted raw gutter hunger that you could not help but take notice. The beats were grimy, dark and dusty, the lyrics were ahead of it's time with metaphors and flows each distinctive from each other. Tracks like proteck ya neck, tha mystery of chessboxin and C.R.E.A.M proved that this crew was gonna put new york back to the forefront and show not just the rest of america but the world what Wu-tang were about. One of the most important groups in hiphop, one of the most important albums in hip hop, you don't have a collection without it. Essential.
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 Just keeps it coming.. don't they? <br /> <br />Awesome album.. anyone that says different just has no respect, or taste for music... <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights - brilliant song.. <br /> <br />Thank you U2 for keeping \\"real\\" music going... a day where most ppl are into these new girl rap artists.. that have one album.. and never see them again... rap songs that won't ever be a \\"classic hit\\"... that music is all temporary.. but songs like \\"city of blinding lights\\" \\"where the streets have no name\\" \\"beautiful day\\" \\"staring at the sun\\" \\"stay, faraway so close\\" \\"One\\" \\"still haven't found what im looking for\\" \\"sunday bloody sunday\\" \\"i will follow\\" \\"october\\" \\"gloria\\" \\"with or without you\\" <br /> <br />I have to stop... <br />because the list keeps going... <br /> <br /> U2 has kept up with the times... as well as fresh new music every release... these ratings are rediculous.. but once again.. it's probably the ppl that are into music that they forget the following year... <br /> <br />ROCK ON U2!
B000000OUJ|5.0|This was the album that introduced me to the art of MCing, this was the album that woke me up and realise that nearly all the music which gets passed off as hip hop on MTV and radio is s**t.<br />I bought this way back and was my first Wu album, there were other artists that I was listening to before that were slowly making me aware of real hip hop but this album grabbed me and took me down to the lower levels of raw and I have never looked back since. Wu-tang were at their best during the ninties and Rza the head member and producer was on fine form, the intro taken from the japanese movie Shogun Assassin get's things off to a raw start before the beat drops and you enter Gza's chamber.<br />The beats are dark and dusty and Gza carry's them superbly, notable guests Masta Killa and Killa Priest drop some outstanding verses on Duel of the iron mic and B.I.B.L.E not to mention the other members of the Wu who all appear and are in fine form, if you like 50 cent, Cassidy or nelly you need not apply, this is for true hip hop heads, lyricism at it's best get this album you owe it to yourself
B000068IEU|3.0|Some people hyped this item for the so-called gore and also for <br />the artistry. I didn't think either one were that extreme.
B000267JQK|4.0|I'm just going to lay it all out on the line; \\"karma and effect\\" was a terrible album. no effort whatsoever if you ask me, and certainly not a worthy follow up. Discalaimer II is an awesome album with 20 songs, and only 2 or 3 which I can honestly say I don't care for. My favorites would have to be fine again, driven under, broken and take me away. Their newest one is crap (sophmore slump, i suppose), but this one is pure gold. a classic, and a fine addition to any collection.
B00005JO0J|5.0|This is one incredible movie. No, you don't have to be familiar with the series to enjoy it, but the familiarity will make several moments in the movie that much more tragic. The action here is incredible, and unlike several of the Star Trek movies, the characters don't deviate from their series personnas. The emotional impact of several scenes is so intense it was hard to stay seated (a crash landing sequence can almost give you motion sickness). This brings a satisfying end to the storyline the original series had started. It's a shame the show never got to tell this story in its entirety. You can see where some parts of the movie are rushed in a way. Something that could have been stretched over weeks in a series had to be handled in minutes, and that robs it a little. But you have to applaud Whedon for being able to tie up all the loose ends he started with just two hours. Shame on the network for cancelling this, but congratulations to Whedon for giving the fans--both old and new--the ending the show deserved. Heroes will shine, and some will fall, but Serenity will live on.<br /><br />Now bring the show back!
B000002B5L|4.0|I remember buying this album back in the day, It is one of the few albums that did well comercially but did not conform to the usual bling bling crap that passes for hip hop these days.<br /><br />The fugees who were wyclef,pras and Lauren hill bring an essence to this album which was clearly missing from their debut, tracks like Fu Gee La, Mask, Ready or not and killing me softly demonstrated their versatility as artists displaying hard beats and lyrics while also releasing a comercial sensibility that did not compromise their artistic edge. The score is one of my personal favourate albums that has stood the test of time and Fu Gee la is one of my favourate songs of all time which just demonstrates the quality in which the fugees bring.
B000BB1MIC|4.0|It happens on many shows that when one or more of the principal characters transitions from high school to college, the series sometimes loses its footing. Gilmore Girls did lose some of what made it loveable from previous seasons in their fourth season.  Though good as always, the fourth season was lacking and it was a new dynamic to get used to.  However, any charm and wit that were lost in the fourth season are reclaimed in Gilmore's fifth and strongest season to date. <br /> <br />Season 5 explores Rory's journey into adulthood as she begins to embrace the life that her mother ran away from. Rory's relationship with the wealthy Logan Huntzberger unnerves her mother as much as it thrills and pleases her grandparents. We also see the long-awaited blossoming (and often tested) romance of Lorelai and Luke.  The audience is also exposed to a side of Richard and Emily that was only hinted at in previous seasons; their obsession with class, breeding and appearances. It manifests itself in horrible ways, driving a wedge between both Rory and Lorelai, as well as Lorelai and her mother with whom she had been on relatively good terms with in season 4.  <br /> <br />The bonds between mother and daughter are tested both at the end and the beginning of season 5, in ways never before seen on this loveable, relatable and well-written season. Gilmore Girls has definitely emerged as a series that transcends all ages, races and genders.
B000002HFU|4.0|When I first saw the cover to this album I laughed my head off, ODB used his welfare card as his first imprint into the world as a solo artist. ODB impressed me on the wu-tang debut on tracks like shame on a n**ga and proteck ya neck and this album is that natural progression, return to the 36 chambers is a great continuation of the wu debut while at the same time showcasing more of what ODB has to offer.<br />The production on this album is top quality that does not stray from the classic wu sound while at the same time the beats give you the impression that only a person like ODB could spit on them to make it work, Rza new what to give him and it worked. The guests on this album work and add to what is already a great peace of music.<br />Some people may not enjoy ODB's style but that is to be expected his often erratic and and sometimes simple wordplay may put off certain lyrical purists but it is all just part of his charm, ODB brought a freshness and originality which was clearly under appreciated at the time and now after his passing people are now starting to wake up which is a shame. Overall this is a classic album not only for die hard wu fans but for fans of pure hip hop generally, don't miss out give it a try. RIP ODB, may you live on
B00005JO0J|5.0|Everyone in the theater was into it. It delivers. Reminded me of when I first saw Star Wars (all though it wasn't quite the same - there will never be another Star Wars just because it was the first). It's been a long time since I experienced so many emotions in a theater...and this is coming from a guy that fell asleep watching Terminator 3...my buddy had to wake me up because I was snoring. This flick ROCKS!!!
B000AARKW6|5.0|Carlito's Way is based on the books Carlito's Way & After Hours by Edwin Torres.This  a reunion of Al Pacino & Brain  De Palma after Scarface.The two are a dynamic duo.Making two great mob films.Both memorable & superbly made.    Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) a ex-druglord gets out of prison & wants to do what's right.Make his dream.Be clean.No more violence.Because thats thats not who he is anymore.But Carlito is still believes in honor of friends & loyalty & all of his old reflexes always come back to remind him.His friend & lawyer Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) was a small time guy,now he aint no punk no more.He remembers his old girl Gail (Penelope Ann Miller) & how beautiful she is & reunites with her.But as good & honest as Carlito try's make his life does his fate get sealed little by little.    This film has great performances by the whole cast.By Pacino that never lets us down in any of his performances.We have Sean Penn in a great part as Kleinfeld as he falls down the path of corruption that we hardly recognize him with big bald frizzy hair.Also some performances by Luis Guzman,John Lequizamo & Viggo Mortensen in some their first parts.Guzman now get lots of      the best supporting parts their are.Leguizamo is a great comedian & serious actor with a career already.And Mortensen that is one the best actors around.    The direction is spectacular by De Palma.He is one of the best directors alive.Giving us great films like Scarface,Gretting,Carrie,,Blow Out,The Untouchables & Carlito's Way.He is one of the new masters of suspense after Hitchock.The setup in the subway & Grand Central Station is a marvel in direction,writting & suspense.Its well staged & perfect.The music by Patrick Doyle adds really to the suspense of the film & the sadness & loss that this film projects as well.And this very well written script by David Koepp his best in my opinion that really put him on the market as a serious writer.    This a great film.This is recommend to all Pacino,Penn & De Palma fans & all suspense & mob lovers out their.A great movie of a man that cant get away from his own fate that closes on him.
B0002IU988|5.0|Sure, we're all sad that Creed dissapaited, but this cd makes up for it in a big way. This is my #1 album right now. It's genius. AMAZING!!!
B00005ASHM|3.0|So I was looking around the Internet and found \\"Rolling Stone's\\" list of top 500 albums, and there at number two was \\"Pet Sounds.\\" An album I had heard only twice before and remembered little of. Had I missed something? <br /> <br />Answer: no. <br /> <br />There will always be a conflict between critical acclaim and general accessibility - at least in these days of criticism, print media, and recordings. After all, critics are usually professional fans, knowledgeable, and...well...critical. Fans like what they hear and usually don't know why. <br /> <br />So let me say, when I ran out and got \\"Pet Sounds\\" and listened to it...I didn't like it. Why did I dislike, despite the official and orthodox view that this is one of the best albums ever made? <br /> <br />For one, while most people laud Brian Wilson's genius in producing and mixing these tracks, most of them sound over-mixed, over-produced, mashed and pounded into a gush of treacle. Again, most people laud Wilson's personal lyrics, symbolizing the end of innocence of both an era and his entrance into adulthood. I heard lyrics slavishly devoted to a rhyme scheme and simple rhythmic structure. Lyrics - not groundbreaking or inherently personal, but of the traditional rock motif: loss at love. I also heard a warbling, high-pitched voice often too unsteady to enjoy.  <br /> <br />I counted two classic songs: \\"Wouldn't it Be Nice?\\" and \\"Sloop John B.\\" I heard a few enjoyable instrumentals - audaciously exploiting trombones, banjos, barking dogs and some heavy, wheezing fuzz bellows - and a couple decent pop tunes, \\"God Only Knows,\\" \\"Caroline No,\\" etc. But most of the songs are unremarkable, even annoying. <br /> <br />In the recent Dylan documentary on PBS, someone said of Dylan's music that it sounded like it was a hundred years old, but was still remarkably current. Bingo. \\"Pet Sounds\\" feels very much of its time and place. Like some critically acclaimed black-and-white art house movies, \\"Pet Sounds\\" feels like aninstrumental and influential track for its time. You still hear echoes of the album in CDs from Beck, for example. I also suspect the album's high place in history is due in part to a desire to pay homage to Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' boy genius and rock's resident madman. There's no doubt Wilson is a genius, that what he did on \\"Pet Sounds\\" was remarkable. But not timeless. And number two of all time? <br /> <br />No.
B000AMF7BK|5.0|I thought Sigur Ros' previous three albums were spectacular, but this thing- it throws the curve.  I mean, I gave the other albums five stars, so this album gets seven.  Every single song is magic, and the album flows together better than the previous ones.  This is still not radio friendly, but it's definitely more accessible to new Sigur Ros fans.  If you are just now checking them out, you should buy this album first; you WILL like it, and you WILL want to buy their previous releases.  I guarantee it.
B00003CXDB|5.0|This is probably one of the most famous movies of all times. The movie is absolutely amazing! The story seems to be pretty simple, but when you start paying attention to details, there are endless layers underneath. Almost 20 years after it was made it's still one of the best movies about business and capitalism.
0440237688|5.0|The imagination of Lois Lowry seems boundless as she creates a world with perfect detail. The explanation is flawless, the images peerless. Once I picked up the book, I could not stop reading it. From the beginning, when the main character, Jonas is getting ready for very important ceremony of Twelve, until the end, I was mesmerized by this book. Freedoms, which are taken for granted in our world, are talked about in this book and it really made me appreciate them. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Utopian-style books.
B00068NVI4|5.0|\\"Songs from Tsongas\\" is a superb document of an incredible tour by the world's greatest progressive rock band. It's one of Yes' two best DVDs, second only to the magnificent \\"Symphonic Live.\\"    First, the awesome, moving Roger Dean stage set makes this a true visual experience. The set, which is sort of an undersea garden/mystical landscapes hybrid, fills the imagination. Dean, if you recall, did the artwork for many classic Yes albums, and looking at this stage is like watching a Dean painting come to life.    The set list is absolutely, positively spectacular. Yes was much-maligned in recent years for their stagnant, predictable set list, but on their 2004 tour they aired music that never been played live in their 35-year history, most notably the stellar mid-90s epic \\"Mind Drive.\\" Other songs - ranging from \\"Going for the One\\" to \\"Sweet Dreams\\" - hadn't been visited since the 70s, and obligatory pieces like \\"Roundabout\\" were given fresh arrangements. And there were the 20-minute epics - in addition to \\"Mind Drive,\\" the show features an excellent version of \\"Ritual.\\"    The musician line-up is stellar. While the Yes line-up seems to change as frequently as the weather, on this night it was the classic line up of Anderson/Howe/Squire/Wakeman/White. The performances are excellent, but again, when isn't a Yes performance excellent?    The filming and editing are professional and unobtrusive. Quite simply, you feel as if you are there, on a magical and exciting evening.    The downsides? None. I do get tired of whiners who complain that their Personal Coliseum Dolby Spherical Total-Immersion System version 9,000.0 was lab tested in Switzerland to find this DVD is mixed infinitesimally to the whatever (detectable to radiologically-mutated chihuahuas and Borneo guano bats, but not humans of course).    So again, this is an awesome tour of the one of the greatest musical forces of all time, on one of their greatest tours. Highly, highly recommended.
1400095913|5.0|This novel took my breath away!  It was awesome.  I have read hundreds of mysteries and I have never been so shocked as I was at the ending of this novel.  I was, literally, blown away.  I will read his future novels because not only are they refreshingly different but I love Jeff Lindsay's  use of the English language.  Words take you into the inner workings of the sane/insane mind and what a journey it is.  5 stars.
B0000CDL93|4.0|Sure, it takes all sorts of liberties.  Even after you subtract the understandable dramatic license, the combined characters, the name changes, and other switch-a-roos that you can expect from any movie based on real events or where mysterious amounts of money & lawyers seeming to be protecting certain individuals from needed scrutiny, there are still some inaccuracies in this film.  Stone admitted it and has said JFK is meant to get people to ask questions, not as the final authoritative word.  It's one undeniably plausible possibility, if you'll pardon the reversal of that phrase.  You also have to take into account that Newman and Prouty had as much influence in shaping the final conclusions this film comes to about the assassination as Garrison himself.  But on the whole, it gets enough of it correct and still manages to be surprisingly fair for such an admittedly subjective film.<br /><br />In spite of even John Marrs' (???) alleged influence, the movie JFK does a phenomenal job portraying the story from Jim Garrison's own perspective -- paranoia, stubbornness, fixation on Clay Shaw, and all.  It even presents, in the heat of the moment, the automatic assumptions attributing the MLK and RFK assassinations to the same conspiracy.  I mean, who wouldn't?  It was insanity.  You had the CIA purposely sabotaging his investigation (Helms and Marchetti both admitted this later), death threats, witnesses changing stories or dying, evidence the FBI, Secret Service, Dallas PD, and Warren Commission had subverted the original investigation (which we now know is also a fact, regardless of the motives).  The whole world seemed to be closing in around him.  His wife even brings up his apparent persecution of Shaw's alleged homosexuality, something others would rely on later to try and discredit Garrison, including the next DA Harry Connick Sr (yes, the dad), who gained notoriety for trying to withhold the Garrison files from the ARRB by throwing a former cop and reporter in jail.<br /><br />True, Garrison wasn't even in the courtroom for much the trial; he didn't need to be.  That wouldn't have been very interesting or entertaining for a film, though, which works best with a central protagonist up front and center doing the most visible work.  Garrison also wasn't present to see David Ferrie's rant about \\"a mystery wrapped up in an enigma\\"... or words to that effect, but it works better than him hearing it from the colleague second hand.  Garrison did roughly make a similar, rousing closing speech at the trial, however.  And years later the judge even said he regretted that Shaw got off.  We know now that Shaw and Bertrand were the same person, he did work for the agency, and was involved in overseas plots.  We also know that Walter Sheridan at NBC was trained by the CIA and then sheep-dipped into NSA.  So they had been literally 'out to get' Garrison.  I would complain there's a lack of the religious and extremist component that Garrison stumbled upon.  It gets even weirder.  I suppose for the early 1990s, bringing that up may have prevented the film from even being made.<br /><br />Whether he took full advantage of it, or not, Stone does have an exceptional knowledge of the subject.  In a forum coinciding with the film's release, he was clearly the strongest debater.  Others, like Edward Epstein, were forced to concede numerous facts to him.  Though on the right general track, I do not think Garrison was necessarily correct on all accounts.  That does not change the issue that justice was obstructed.  The excuse may have been that Shaw was innocent and national security was at stake.  Perhaps so, but there's a reason the process was not allowed to produce that conclusion itself.  Certainly you can't blame Garrison for pointing in the direction of the dirty laundry when he smelled something rotten.  Nor is it appropriate to disparage those who think there might be more to the case.ail.<br /><br />True, Garrison wasn't even in the courtroom for much the trial; he didn't need to be.

B000003TA4|5.0|I can't understand why Kurt Cobain died. He did a few great<br /><br />songs like Smells Like Teen Spirit, & Lithium. Anyway, this<br /><br />album is a very hard rocker for SLTS and other hits. But<br /><br />the only problem about this album is it's overrated.<br /><br />I think Pearl Jam could go better together with this.

B000002J09|1.0|This sucks!! Most of the songs on this album are screaming,<br /><br />Led Zeppelin are one of the worst bands in history of rock<br /><br />and roll. The vocalist screams a lot, and the words are very<br /><br />disturbing. Stairway to Heaven is probably the best song on<br /><br />this album. This album is also overrated too. This is another<br /><br />one every rock fan should AVOID!!!! BUY SOMETHING FROM DIRE<br /><br />STRAITS, FOREIGNER, OR GUNS N' ROSES. THIS IS TRASH!!!!!
B000286RNY|4.0|My first encounter with Stephen Chow's work was \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\".  I laughed so hard I literally cramped up and had to leave the theatre to recover.  I was hooked.  So I was anxious to see this movie as I had heard it was good.  If you appreciate quirky, then you will find this movie to be quite entertaining.  My one suggestion is that you don't waste your time on the sanitized US version.  Stick with the original Chinese which is somewhat longer and just a bit more complex because of the the material that remains intact.
B000002572|5.0|Boston rocks!! This is the best Boston album to come out with. <br />It contains classics like MORE THAN A FEELING, PEACE OF MIND, <br />FOREPLAY/LONG TIME, ROCK & ROLL BAND, & SMOKIN'. Hugely recommended.
0486440966|5.0|This book satisfies the mystery lover, the romantic, the reader who loves period novels, everything you could want.  It was hard to put down, and recommened to me by more than just one avid reader as one of their favorites.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|5 stars for the song, SHINE IT ALL AROUND. I just heard it on <br />the radio today. It is Robert Plant's hardest rocker. I would <br />sure like to get this CD for that song SHINE IT ALL AROUND. <br />Isn't he the singer for Led Zeppelin?
B00005JO0J|5.0|Too many people are treating this movie like it is some unaired 15th episode of Firefly.  That is a mistake because in order for this movie to be a success it is going to have to appeal to a larger audience.  I have never been a Joss fanatic I came to Joss through Firefly not Buffy or Angel and I am not the only one.   <br /> <br />That being said how is Serenity?  Very good not fantastic by any means but still it didn't disappoint me either.  I liked the movie but I missed some of the lightheartedness from the series that I thought was missing here.  I realize that by writing this sentence I am contradicting my previous statement about Serenity not being an episode of Firefly but it is an easy trap to fall into.  I liked the movie very much and I hope there is a sequel.    <br /> <br />Overall-What this movie lacks in big name actors it makes up for with heart and characters you can root for.  I can't remember the last time I went to a movie and actually sympathized with the characters.   <br />
B000AOENJA|4.0|It seems that David Gray's life has changed for the worse. At least that's what it semms from his music. Life In Slow Motion is an utter heartache.<br /><br />From the forlorn opener Alibi to the current single The One I Love, Gray displays a kind of helplessness that builds around love. The album the culminates to a high in the middle with the title track Slow Motion,From Here You Can Almost See The Sea and Ain;t No Love, the trilogy of songs that express the unexpressed of a draggy life, of unrequited love and of being unloved. The songs are often heavy-hearted, interspersed with one or two more uplifting tracks in between before closing with yet another pair of poignant tracks, the beautiful Now and Always and the aching Disappearing World.<br /><br />The dualdisc features the album in 5.1 stereo on the DVD side as well as a short documentary on the making of the album plus photographs. Nice little extras but not essential. Get the normal edition if youcan do without these.
0553588486|5.0|I bought this book in Mass Market Paperback a few years ago. It was worth every penny. Now that it's discounted, I think everyone should go out and buy it. Martin has layers upon layers of story here. It's very involved. There are tons of characters, guaranteeing that you will identify with at least one. The series is a lot of reading, but it's really worth the time and money, I swear.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|When this movie first came out in DVD, I had no intention of buying it much less watching it.  Just wasn't interested and was not familiar with the opera and story.  Then a friend strongly suggested I see this, which I promptly did.  The story, music and singing completely took my breath away!  I was hooked and wanted more!  Needless to say, I did buy the DVD, but was disappointed there were no extra features.  This mainly was because every single time I watched Phantom, (and we're past a dozen times now!), I was dying for inside looks into the characters from the actors etc.  I didn't realize until later that sometimes special features are released much later after the movie comes out.   <br />   So lo and behold, I was escstatic when I ran across the the 2-disc special edition, which I promptly bought.  For just a few dollars more than the movie, this special edition delivers well and beyond all expectation! It's over three hours.  The first half explains how the Phantom was even brought to Broadway.  It's extremely interesting and very insightful.  The second half is the actual behind the scenes documentary on how the movie was made, the challenges they had (which were tremendous), why they chose the actors they did, insight into the characters, how they did the crashing chandelier, (fascinating), and my favorite, the sing-a-long with the crew of the main theme-what a hoot!!! <br />  If this sounds up your alley, you will love this!! Enjoy!
6305126062|3.0|Real life horsemen roll our eyes at the numerous continuity goofs in this film, such as the ever-changing shapes of Pilgrim's face markings, and so on.<br /><br />At one point, Annie and the Booker family discussed the virtues of \\"black baldy Angus\\" yet the roundup scene showed a bunch of mutt cattle of various breeds and colors.<br /><br />Please note: Monty Roberts was NOT the inspiration for the Tom Booker character. (...)<br /><br />Recommended reading to go with this film: Horse Whispers & Lies.
B000003EUL|5.0|Brahms' Piano Concerto #2 is a classic masterpiece that dwarfs many other nice concertos with its vivid texture, color & romanticism at its zenith. <br />Richter's playing of the first movement leaves Emil Giles in the dust.  His pace is superb, & superior to that of Giles who plays it more restrictively within the orchestral compass.   Richter's pace commands the orchestra, thus setting the pace & tone of the concerto.  And what a virtuoso pace indeed! <br />Recording sound is awesome compared to Richter's many other old recordings.  <br /> <br />Bethoven's Apasionata Sonata simply goes with Richter's character & the way he plays the piano.  Dramatic, Violent , Fortisimo passages without sacrificing the score's structure. This is really good stuff folks.  <br />
B000AXSN5G|4.0|oh man i love the negative reviewers here...harvest moon was a comeback?  uh,yeah, after this note's for you, freedom, and ragged glory....and the other dude, saying how horns are wrong on a neil record.  uh, guess you don't like freedom, or after the goldrush for that matter (the oboe solo in the title song) <br /> <br />oh, and as for the new record, prairie wind.  well done, not all the songs work (for me) but the good ones are realllllly good.  standouts, in order of my preference: falling of the face of the earth, no wonder, prairie wind, the painter.  i guess i would rate the rest as this old guitar, here for you, when god made me, far from home, he was the king, and it's a dream.  if you're a musician by all means get the special edition with the bonus dvd, it shows the recording of the whole album.  ben keith wins mvp for his slide work (although all the musicians are stellar)
B00005JNTX|5.0|First of all... it's not a Tarantino movie.  He guest directed one scene... not to spoil anything, but the scene in the car with Del Toro and Clive Owen was the only part of this movie he touched.  The rest was all Rodriguez.  So don't see it based on your expectations for a Tarantino movie.  The feel of the movie is completely true to the source.  It might as well have been storyboarded right from Miller's classic.  Perfect touches of color in a film-noir black and white are both symbolic and appropriate; your attention will not be taken from what isn't important. <br />The actors, too are used perfectly.  You see just enough of each megastar to understand their characters pefectly.  The director declined to overexpose them for the sake of A-List credibility.  If I wondered why a character left prematurely, sure enough, he reappeared and his part was played out.  No loose ends, no unfinished business.  Characters are avenged or killed, and no one dies without a purpose fulfilled.  Because the movie is based upon 3 separate graphic novels, it would make no sense to have all characters interacting all the time.  Only recurring characters appear in more than one story, and those characters serve the movie and the source faithfully. <br />For those who are not familiar to the source, the characters are often portrayed as half-way superhuman.  It would be absolutely tragic for Marv to not be able to cleave through a dozen cops, or for Hartigan to not take bullets and keep smiling.  The most gruesome characters meet the most gruesome fates.  This is Sin City at its finest, and not one thing could have been better.
B00005NRO3|5.0|As I said it is the best in the Scream series and twice as good as the first and third. My favorite in the series. Enough said.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|If you're new to Fiona Apple, I'd recommend Tidal first. It has more radio friendly singles, so to speak, but When the Pawn does not disappoint. In fact it seems more of a complete album than the last. This one I can listen to without skipping one song. Not many artists can accomplish such a full album these days. Anyone going through heartbreak, self-doubt, self-loathing, can pop this cd in and feel like an empathic friend is there with you. The songs are amazing, less corporate, if you will, than the last album, but truely amazing. Highlights would be Paper Bag, Fast as you Can, Limp, and A Mistake, 4 songs that run seemlessly together. You can't ask for much better than this one, five stars all the way!
630521610X|5.0|This is the only best teen slasher movie I have seen. Forget all the other and buy this with its sequels. This is good movie but the  sequel is twice as good.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I would like to give a review of this CD, but since it is copy protected, I can not play it on my computer. Since this is the only way I play cd's I'm pretty steamed that Amazon didn't put a notice after the title as they did on Foo Fighters \\"In Your Honor [CONTENT/COPY-PROTECTED CD]\\".  I wouldn't have bought it and I will be returning it!
6305327041|5.0|I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers are talking about.  This was a great movie.  Granted, it was a little odd, but still cool.  To be on the same side, rent it first, but you'll probably want to buy it soon afterwards.  To each his own.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This CD is a very hard hitting, great CD with a perfect combination of songs for the Hard Rock genre. If you like Hard Rock with good, meaningful Lyrics that is not part of the \\"pop rock\\" scene, get this CD.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|This film is funny...if you're a stoned tosser with a peer group preasure sense of humour.<br /><br />One joke...and that's not even that funny.<br /><br />...I got reviewing skills.
B00007LTIA|3.0|This release has been pretty well covered by others, but there's a few points from my own listening I'd like to share.<br /><br />First off, while the remastering sounds pristine, this is far from Yes's best-produced album. The recording is somewhat thin, and it quite frequently sounds like guitarist Steve Howe is playing in a different studio than the rest of the band. This would be less of a problem if this weren't also Howe's most self-indulgent album, with tons of nods to other, better Yes songs scattered through the near-endless soloing. Also, the run-throughs are interesting, but probably only worth having for die-hard Yes fans. In other words, if you can find a used copy of the old remaster of this album (which lacks the studio run-throughs), you'll have a cheaper and much less unwieldy release on your hands that will sound just as good.<br /><br />While there's a lot of good material scattered across this record, there's also a ton of filler. Yes never really excelled at creating coherent, unified compositions, and the weakness of their cut and paste approach to songwriting is at its most prominent here. I think this is a lot of the reason why this record has such a love it / hate it reputation. It's grown on me, but I still think it's more \\"ramshackle\\" than \\"difficult\\". Yes's music has never really been all that difficult, drawing on the pastoral psychedelic tradition of the late 60s. It's just that when they throw everything together, it can all sound a bit obtuse until you've heard the individual pieces enough to string them together in your head.
B000001DTM|5.0|Excellent in every way from beginning to end.  Arguably their best album, or at least tied with Joshua Tree.  You can't go wrong with this one!
B00005JO0J|5.0|Serenity has wit, action, and intelligent dialog. It seems many people can't handle that combination in a movie - they find mindless tripe to be more their speed.<br /><br />The level of sassy, blunt, crass dialog was just fantastic. The plot was strong, and the execution was done well. Joss Whedon's directorial path was masterful, and the actors brought their roles to life. You do not have to have seen Firefly (the show that this movie was based on) to like the movie - at the showing last night, a half-dozen of my fellow moviegoers who had never seen it swore that they loved the movie and wanted to borrow my DVD's of the show!<br /><br />I loved Serenity. I have seen it three times, and I will go to see it again when it opens on Friday. The movie isn't *quite* a 10/10, unless you are a Browncoat at heart, and love and respect the characters. To the general public, this movie will probably garner one of two reactions, as most Joss Whedon productions do:<br /><br />Either you hate it, or you love it. There's usually no middle ground.<br /><br />Give Serenity a try. See where you fall.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|At least since Silver and Gold, Mr. Young's music seems to have transformed.  Its basic ingredients remain: good melody, lyrics which aspire to be thought-provoking and emotionally rich without being too literary.  But his recent releases reflect an apparent comfort Mr. Young has found in his life after dozens of albums and a long, seemingly beautiful marriage, to Pegi.  His newer releases remain emotionally rich, but are even more thoughtful and, as a result, more thought-provoking... even philosophical.  These newer releases sound like the flowering of a thoughtful life's experiences as he accepts mortality.  I suspect many Young fans will either not appreciate his perspective shift or, even if they do, understandably might be nostalgic for Neil as he was before he hit \\"middle age.\\"  Personally, one of the things I love about Mr. Young's catalog is that his music changes, transforming favorite motifs into new expressions.  I'm thankful I'm around to watch and listen to his talents flower as he faces his mortality.  He truly is a gift.  Musically, Prairie Wind is not, I think, as good as Silver and Gold was (Though it is good).  But stopping here would miss the point, I believe.  For Prairie Wind seems to be driven by its lyrics.  It's an inspired lyrical expression of a more mature Neil Young.  I bought the cd/dvd version, which includes a lyric book (I don't know if the cd only version has it).  I recommend giving Prairie Wind a listen while looking at the lyrics.  Like mortality itself, there's something powerful about the emotionally raw expression of the themes they explore.  I was especially touched by The Painter's expression of aesthetic immortality, Falling Off The Face Of The Earth's expression of mortal love, It's a Dream's ode to a life's fading memories, Here For You's expression of paternal love, This Old Guitar's tribute to the artist's messenger, and When God Made Me's philosophical self-reflection.  Thanks for sharing, Mr. Young!  And I'm looking forward to hearing your old guitar at this year's Bridge School Benefit!

0394700023|5.0|Albert Camus finished his first novel, \\"The Stranger\\", when he could not leave Paris during its first year of occupation by the German army in 1940-41.  This was France's darkest hour, especially when right-wing collaborators betrayed many other French citizens to the evil Gestapo.   <br /> <br />Hitler and his Nazi hordes seemed poised to rule all of Europe, plunging it into a new dark age.  How could anyone cope with living in a world like this?  It seemed impossible for decent people to believe in anything at all.   <br /> <br />\\"The Stranger\\", an allegory, does not directly address this crisis.  Camus instead tells of a man in Algeria, the narrator, who appears to care nothing about anyone or anything.  He tells us of his indifference or boredom to nearly every situation.   <br /> <br />The tale begins, for example, when his mother dies alone in a retirement home; he seems only annoyed that going to her funeral ceremony has disrupted his weekend.  Later, when his mistress asks him if he loves her, he comments that \\"it really does not matter if I love you or not, does it?\\"  He observes a lonely old man frequently beating his only companion, a scrawny dog, and reacts to this pathetic situation only by wondering why they put up with each other.  Why doesn't the miserable old man get rid of the dog?  Why doesn't the dog run away?  Why do they need each other so much?  <br /> <br />His only real pleasure, going to the sunny beach, is disrupted one weekend by a fight arising out of a misunderstanding with two Arabs.  This somehow leads to his killing one of the two with a knife in apparent self-defense and his arrest for murder.  The tale moves rapidly through more and more misunderstandings and absurdities before, during, and after his court trial. <br /> <br />I should not, of course, tell how the plot is resolved but urge you to find out for yourself.  Anyhow, what's really important in \\"The Stranger\\" is how he finally becomes aware and how to cope with his aimlesslife and with the suffering surrounding him but simply did not know how to cope with these absurdities.  <br /> <br />At the end, he finally finds peace of mind.  He says he has learned to welcome the cold indifference of the universe.  The stars do not care one way or another how he thinks or acts, so he is free...free at last...to do what he chooses.   <br /> <br />At this time Camus's publisher also released his famous essay, \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\".  He tells how the gods had punished Sisyphus, a titan, for having defied them by bringing fire to humans.  He is forced every day to push a huge rock up a steep hill, knowing in advance that just before he comes to the top, it will plunge back downhill.  Yet, he does not despair.  The gods have not defeated him; he is not a dumb animal but is fully aware of the absurdity of his plight.  At the end of each day, he is consoled with these thoughts as he walks downhill.  Camus tells us that \\"we must imagine Sisyphus happy\\".  Yes...happy!! <br /> <br />\\"The Stranger\\" and \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" brought relief from despair for many French and other Europeans.  They learned that they were at least free to think what they liked.  The gods could not take that away from them.  They were free to hope and, whenever they chose, to act.  We, too, can rebel against the gods anytime we choose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00007LL7O|2.0|Title said it all, this is nowhere near as good like their other albums.
B00000IL1K|4.0|Listening to this cd is some sort of an escape. <br /> <br />It is enticing, mysterious, and a little bit reminiscent of Enigma with Gregorian Chants and unique melodies. <br /> <br />The song that I had to have was \\"Deliver me\\" a beautiful and haunting visual ballad/song that made me feel like I went back in time. <br /> <br />Gorgeous and sensual music, for any type of music preference, mood or interest range!
6304698623|2.0|\\"A Little Princess\\" is a great story. Sadly, this movie doesn't tell it. A Hollywood-influenced director got hold of the story and stuffed it with all the elements of a cheesy American thriller film -- a chase with the heroine dangling by her fingertips from a balcony, a villainesse too evil to imagine, AMNESIA (for crying out loud!) I was especially put off by the 20th-century attitude coming out of the mouth of this Victorian-era girl.<br /><br />Don't buy this version; find the Wonderworks version of A Little Princess, and buy that one. It's faithful to the novel, and it's superb.
0895260131|4.0|This book is based on history and on dozens of quotes from the Koran. I was surprised at the number of Koran passages that encourage murder and torture and hatred. The book also shows that Islam has been spread from the very beginning by waging war. The book also shows that the Crusades were a reaction to a war against Europe that had been going on for hundreds of years. It is well written and provides a fascinating look into Islam.
0875428940|5.0|This was not my first deck but it has been the deck that I choose to do readings with ever since I came across it years ago. The illustrations are colorful but not distracting to the meanings of the cards as some illustrations can be. I find them easy to interpret and I also use a companion book with them titled \\"Tarot Plain and Simple\\" by Anthony Louis which uses these cards as the pictures. If you highlight the key words and phrases in this book for each card with a highlighter pen, it makes referencing the meanings easy too. I also give this deck as a gift to everyone who is \\"starting out\\" in the discovery of tarot. Everyone that I have gifted these cards to has enjoyed them very much. I will always keep these cards as my \\"main reader cards\\"!
B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie was an instant classic when it hit the theaters.  This movie was made in the 80's and it is still one of the best known movies of all time.  People just can't get enough of the Goonies, because they rock.  Movie is about some kids who go treasure hunting and get involved with some bankrobbers.  You need to watch it, it's soo good.  I promise you that you'll love this movie!!!
B0009VRHLK|1.0|To keep myself from falling asleep during this incredibly boring movie, I finally picked a book and started reading.<br /><br />Thank God/dess, it was only 92 minutes long and I didnt see it in a movie theater...
B00004XQP4|5.0|Ok, Maybe not their TOP top album.. in my opinion American Idiot or Dookie would take the No. 1 slot, but I feel that Warning is probably their 3rd best album. It has a lot of \\"re-listen-ability\\". The songs on this one, especially Warning, Minority and Misery, almost beg you to sing along with them. If you like GreenDay at all, I'm betting this will be one of your favorites. And if you somehow DON'T know Greenday much at all, but like Rock/Alternative, this is a good introduction to Mike's fantastic guitar, Tre's insanity on the drums, and, of course, Billie Joe's famous nasal voice that for some reason you just gotta love!
B000002LND|5.0|If you could look up the definition for Pop/Dance music, you would find Madonna written all over it. She is clearly talented and the Immaculate Collection is undoubtedly one of her best. Oh, and one more thing, the person who titled this album knew exactly what they were talking about.
0385006896|5.0|Sherlock Holmes, the quintessential sleuth, is the invention of author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  His clever exploits are (mostly) narrated by one Dr. Watson, an ingenious device to stretch out the reader's suspense.  The Sherlock Holmes mythos, if not \\"classic\\" or \\"great\\", is certainly one of the best- loved and read in English literature.  While I would not feel qualified to review the contents of the stories themselves (these works have outlived any of their contemporary critics), I can say that I prefer to collect stories I like in one anthology rather in bits and dribbles as dictated by some editor's preference.  Get the whole thing at once and be done with it!  It's not a small work (1000+ pages, which is heavy), but you won't get tired of reading about the Great Detective, even by the end.  Also, these are mostly short stories, written for periodicals, and lend themselves kindly to a daily commute on the bus.    I would finally point out that there has been a reissue of the same book, but with the font reduced to fit the entire work on about 500 pages.  A comparison between this book and the other shows a little more than 2 pages of this to 1 of the other; I personally would avoid the eye strain for the muscle strain and use the full-size edition.
0312983867|3.0|Sorry to say, number eight was a bit of a disappointment.  In trying to be positive, I must say, this book lasted MUCH longer then the first seven.  It was sometimes difficult to pick up number eight to continue, where the first seven books in this series were difficult to put down.  Janet, seems to have lost her way...the laugh-out-loud pages where absent.  I really missed the grandiose humor of Grandma and her funeral home adventures!  Ms. Plum did manage to blow-up a few cars, but the humor wasn't there.  The most disappointing part of the book was when she strayed from \\"the hunk\\" to \\"the punk.\\" <br />I am still looking forward to number nine in hopes of finding the old Stephanie and her fun filled family.  Don't be discouraged by this review if you have never read any of the books in this series...start at the book number one and be prepared for a fast reads and laugh-out-loud 5 star adventures!
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Movies don't usually come with this much promise: a beloved novel, a celebrated filmmaker, and an incredibly-talented cast...but COLD MOUNTAIN just doesn't connect.  The direction is there, and the performances are great (Zellwegger is wonderful), but the story misses the mark.<br /><br />I loved THE ENGLISH PATIENT, but this film neglects the lovers and piles on everything else (and I mean EVERYTHING).<br /><br />The lovers are barely introduced when Jude Law is whisked off to the most hellish places of the Civil War.  Law and Nicole Kidman are only left to think of each other as fantasy lovers or ideals, so no emotional connection takes place between them.  At least one that that the audience can invest in.<br /><br />And the sheer horrors of what Law goes through over and over pretty much numb us by the time they do get together.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie--and it is better than TITANIC (great movie, lame romance) and the laughably-bad PEARL HARBOR (lame movie, ridiculous romance)--but there was no emotional pay off to COLD MOUNTAIN.  Not like THE ENGLISH PATIENT.<br /><br />It's like a love song where the singer forgets to sing about the girl.

B00005JOHO|4.0|One doesn't have to have read Mark Frost's book (he adapted his book for the screenplay) to enjoy this movie.  Obviously, the book contains much more detail regarding the personal histories of Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, JJ McDermott & others leading up to (and following) the 1913 US Open, and there was no way that Frost could have included all of the minute detail without at least doubling the length of the movie.  One also misses the discussion of the technology available to the turn-of-the-century golfer, as well as some of the geo-political forces that led to Vardon & Ted Ray making their tour of the United States.<br /><br />However, what one does get is a beautifully filmed story that has the predictable feel-good nature one would expect from a Disney film, without being sappy.  The principals bear a striking resemblance to the historical figures (right down to Eddie the caddie), and the historical match is accurately rendered.  While one doesn't get the book's stroke by stroke narrative, one does get to enjoy the energy of the galleries as well as the immense pressures bearing down on the tournament leaders.<br /><br />I only have a couple of significant complaints about the movie.  One is with the wholy fictional relationship (concocted for the purposes of this film) between Francis Ouimet and the upper class young lady.  It smacks uncomfortably of Jack-Rose relationship in Titanic, and when the movie focuses on this relationship, it skates dangerously close to outright corniness.  Fortunately, once the tournament begins, this subplot is thankfully relegated to the background.  By & large it interferes only minimally with the story.<br /><br />My other beef is with the fact that Harry Vardon comes off as a far too one-dimensional character, as he as portrayed as an ambitious, single-minded, golfing machine, very nearly bereft of passion or emotion.  Frost's book provides far more depth to Vardon than one will find here.  One would not know from the movie that his American tour came not long after his recovery from a bout with tuberculosis (first striking in 1903, after his 4th British Open) which not only derailed his career (and almost ended it) for several years, but came close to killing him.  If the audience could more fully appreciate all of the tremendous obstacles Vardon had overcome, they might be more sympathetic towards him.  While not cast as a villain, Vardon's role in this film definitely is that of Ouimet's nemesis more than anything else, which strikes me as unfair.<br /><br />The one other thing which strikes as unfair is the fact that the audience really has no idea just how tremendously talented these men were.  Frost's book devotes considerable space to the equipment of the time, which was downright primative compared to the clubs and balls today's players use.  I can only imagine the kinds of scores Vardon & Ouimet might post with today's equipment.  However, audiences who don't understand the nature of golf technology in 1913 may only see shots that can be seen a hundred times or more on any PGA tour event on any given weekend, and they may not appreciate the true greatness of these earlier players.  Having made this complaint, I have to admit that I don't know how the film could improve in this area.  I would suggest that you read the book.<br /><br />However, this is a movie that one can enjoy without having any knowledge of golf in general or the 1913 US Open in particular.  Unlike so many films that claim to be \\"based on\\" or \\"inspired by\\" true events (but in fact have almost no resemblance to historical events), what you see in this film by & large is what actually happened.

1591396190|5.0|I have never been a big fan of Michael Porter's \\"Competitive Strategy,\\" which is probably the most influential strategy book of the past 20 years.  After reading \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\", I can much better articulate the nagging feeling in my gut about the shortcomings of Porter's theories. <br /> <br />Through their concept of Value Innovation, the authors discredit Porter's long standing view that there are inherent tradeoffs between a differentiation and low cost position.  Not so. <br /> <br />I've also always thought Porter's approach was rigid and unnecessarily strongly prescriptive -- \\"In market situation X, you should do Y.\\"  Porter's approach is \\"inside the box\\", whereas Blue Ocean Strategy enourages and structures thinking \\"outside the box\\"...an approach that makes far more sense to me as the information age breaks down the traditional boundaries of existing industries. <br /> <br />Strategic planning processes in organizations have fallen into disfavor over the past 10 years.  I predict history will chalk this up to the rigidness and limitations of Porter's theories. <br /> <br />Blue Ocean Strategy is a GREAT book! <br /> <br />

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This CD is definitely a change of pace from their debut album; however, I wouldn't consider that a bad thing. This album is more raw and real. The \\"spacey effects\\" are present enough to emphasize their original sound without detracting from the overall feel and lyrical messages. This CD has it all from the palpable energy in \\"Attack\\" to the haunting vocals in \\"The Story.\\" If you're looking for something addictive and noteworthy, this album is a must.
1592400876|1.0|The short version is that this is a fairly pointless book because Truss doesn't know very much, isn't especially funny, and appears to have a constitutional antipathy towards looking things up.  <br /> <br />The short version is culled from a paper I wrote last year: <br /> <br />The tone of this book is meant to be disarming, clever and personal. The advantage of Truss's approach towards language moralising is that it does not require you to engage with the arguments; indeed, at a superficial level, there are no arguments to show that punctuation matters. If you are not a \\"stickler,\\" the book is not for you (p. 1); if you are, then the book is about making you \\"feel good\\" (34)-to see that there are others like you; to hear that it is not unfashionable to be a stickler; and to have Lynne Truss on your side.  <br /> <br />Truss's trick of switching between the hyperbolic and commonsense tones makes a judgment about her level of seriousness difficult. When, on p. 43, a series of generally amused observations about the apostrophe turns into talk about Pavlovian kill responses occasioned by the misuse of \\"it's,\\" the suggestion seems to be something along the lines of \\"I'm permissive as a rule, but there are some things...\\" Similarly, when she says, \\"It hurts, though. It hurts like hell,\\" (183) she seems to mean it more or less seriously. But when she sounds entirely sane for nearly three pages, and then inserts an example such as \\"I am, of course, going steadily nuts,\\" (91) or admits to having no sense of proportion (28), it seems to work the other way--to imply something like, \\"aren't we cute with our murderous little eccentricities?\\" This reflects the book's ambivalence about whether caring for punctuation should be treated as an eccentricity \\"for the select few\\" (as Truss's mother asked), or as a necessary attitude in these times. <br />  <br />A curious assumption of this book is that sentences have meanings independent of context--so that, for instance, a road signthat says \\"Children drive slowly\\" actually states that children drive slowly, though no one is likely to construe it thus. To some extent I imagine that this bland indifference to the claims of context is a literary pose, adopted to make the lists of quoted mistakes (and the attached witticisms) possible. But the case for our taking punctuation seriously depends largely on our assent to this idea; otherwise, in all her lists of wrongdoing, there are few genuinely ambiguous sentences. (An exception is the old headline \\"dead sons photos may be released\\" (19), in which, alas, we will never know how many sons died, at least unless we read the article. A few other examples, like \\"dicks in tray,\\" though unambiguous in context, must have been distracting.) Truss claims from time to time that bad punctuation affects clarity, but this argument is not developed; what seems to exercise her is the idea of non-standard punctuation as such. <br /> <br />Her attitude towards literature and her assumptions about the reader are interesting. She asks us if we remember a line of Holofernes in Love's Labour's Lost (37), and answers her rhetorical question by saying no, of course we don't, because he's a frightful bore--NOT because we haven't read Shakespeare. She goes on to explain that \\"in Shakespeare's time, an apostrophe indicated omitted letters.\\" She misses or ignores the point of elision, and claims that \\"I am too much i' th' sun\\" is a \\"clear case of a writer employing a new-fangled punctuation mark for the sake of it.\\" (38) It is nothing of the sort; it marks the pronunciation that would keep the metre, and most people who have read Shakespeare are likely to know this.   <br />  <br />It is characteristic of her methods that she does not cite historical or \\"best literary\\" use to justify her positions, only as a curiosity. I am not interested in linguistics, she seems to be saying, but I know where an apostrophe goes. This a-historical, unspecialised attitude gives her no standing to argue about individual points of usage, so her authority can only be sustained as long as her examples are uncontroversial; this is why they are all short and obvious. When she goes into controversial territory her tone is largely descriptive. Still, her balancing act gets a little precarious when she condemns as \\"illiteracies\\" a class of usages that are not uncommon (or so she claims) among people better informed than herself.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Sadly, this movie proved to be an enormous disappointment. <br /> <br />I honestly cannot recall the last time acting on the big screen was so poor. Dracula and his wives made me want to run from the theater in horror, and I don't mean that as a compliment. He was not believable in the least. His wives were even worse. Fidgeting like you're wearing clothes that you are allergic to does not become a bride of Dracula. I'm also sorry to say that Kate Beckinsale's acting was not up to par with her usual performances either. After watching her in other films, this came as a nasty surprise. Hugh Jackman was passable, but not nearly as captivating as he was in the X-Men movies. David Wenham was the only reason I was able to sit through the entire movie. His comical performance was great. But, unfortunately, it was not enough to save the film. <br /> <br />The effects were lacking as well. We are in the times when one can find people to produce decent effects, not ones that look like they were created in the Dark Ages. Some were painful to look at. I've seen better ones in small screen TV shows. <br /> <br />The storyline was also weak. It jumped all over the place without leaving you somewhere long enough to care. It doesn't draw the audience in to hold their attention. One could be more worried about the fact that they ran out of popcorn than wondering how the heroes are going to stop the birth of the baby vampires. <br /> <br />This movie proved to be a huge letdown. I would not recommend it to anyone. It has no substance and even lacks good, cheep thrills. Pass it up in favor of something else.
0385486804|5.0|When I was first going into college in 1997, my older brother told me about this book he had just read, \\"Into the Wild,\\" by Jon Krakauer.<br /><br />He told me the book is about a guy named Chris McCandless, a man who--after donating almost $25,000 in savings to Oxfam (a world poverty and social injustice charity)--went on years of adventures across the country, and eventually tried to survive in the wilds of Alaska, in an old, green and white bus fitted for moose hunters with a bed and a stove.<br /><br />Chris did really well, too, until he ate a poisonous potato seed his guidebook said was safe to eat (though new analyses of the results of his autopsy have suggested he may have been killed by plain old starvation), and until the river between him and civilization rose too high for him to cross back over.<br /><br />Later, his starved, emaciated, sixty-seven-pound body was found by hunters--wasted away on the bed of the bus, in duct-taped jeans, on a piece of Alaskan land surrounded by a triangle of rivers.<br /><br />I couldn't get the story of out my mind.<br /><br />It excited, and saddened, and haunted me.  I bought the book as soon as I could, devoured its contents--once and then twice and then three times--and made plans to go to Alaska.  (I'd always wanted to anyways, and this was the clincher.)<br /><br />After a year of college, I moved to south-central Alaska, and attempted to hitchhike to the bus, but was sidetracked by a moving van full of hippies that took me to a music festival instead.<br /><br />Later in 1998, I made it to the bus with a friend and my dad (flying in by bush helicopter, with a guide), and found the bus much as Chris had left it.  His pants were still there, as was the skeleton of a moose he'd shot, his silverware, his chairs, and his fire ring.  Only his books and the things he'd written on the bus walls were gone.<br /><br />In 1999 I went back again with two friends--hiking into and out of insanely raging rivers, wading through beaver dams and rainstorms, and spending a lot of time being hopelessly lost.  A lot more of Chris's things had gone missing, and the logbook showed a ton of people had come to visit.  Anyway.  \\"Into the Wild\\" changed me.  Getting to (posthumously) know Chris changed me.<br /><br />He became my hero.  He became a symbol to me of not needing to already have experience to gain experience.  He showed me I could do whatever I wanted to, regardless of my experience (or inexperience).  And that was a very significant lesson to me.<br /><br />I grew to love my conception of Chris like I love my brothers.  I traveled Alaska, hitchhiked all over northern Canada and down to the Lower 48 states, canoed all around Lake Powell like Chris canoed the canals of the lower Colorado River (living on brown rice like he did), and hiked up the entire East Coast to benefit Oxfam, the charity Chris gave all his savings to.<br /><br />Along the way, I kind of outgrew Chris McCandless.  I grew to really disagree with the way he had abandoned his family, and with some of the stupider decisions he made...with the decisions that killed him.  I outgrew him, and he doesn't have the influence in my life that he once did, but I still think he was an amazing person, and I'm grateful his example was able to touch my life.  And I'm grateful that Jon Krakauer wrote this book.<br /><br />This, I think, is Krakauer's best book.  It's wonderfully researched, Chris's character is skillfully explored, and Krakauer's writing (at least here) is as good as subjective journalism gets.  Aside from being a terrific portrait of Chris McCandless, this book also contains an excellent chapter on Everett Ruess (the missing 1934 artist-explorer of southern Utah), and a good chapter on the author's own adventure climbing the infamous \\"Devil's Thumb,\\" solo.<br /><br />It's a terrifically written story that people will either love or hate...and I'm certainly one of the former.<br /><br />One last thing.  If you like this book, and you appreciate this story, check out \\"Disappearance: A Map,\\" a book on deaths and disappearances in Alaska.  Chris McCandless makes a cameo in it.  There's also a very good, although very cynical, lengthy article about the cult of Chris McCandless--an article that appeared in an Anchorage, Alaska newspaper not too long ago--and you can easily find it using Google.  It's called \\"I Want To Ride In The Bus Chris Died In,\\" and was written by Sherry Simpson.<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" changed my life, but even if it doesn't change yours, it will at least entertain you for as long as you're reading it.<br /><br />And you really should read it.rances in Alaska.

B0006399FS|2.0|First, let me just say how sad it is that U2 still getting commendation for this album. 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' was a great album. I really enjoyed it and it was great for the band since 'Pop' didn't do too well. But getting prompts for this? Are you serious? Has the music industry lost its mind? Or do you guys just feel bad not giving recognition to Bono for being such an example for leadership and having charisma? I honestly find all this rubbish. This album is really really dull. 'Vertigo' is another 'Elevation' which is my least favorite from ATYCLB, making it sound more like a remake of the latter song instead of a new one. All the other ones which I don't even have time for reviewing are just plain fillers. Honestly, other bands made MUCH BETTER albums than these guys in 2004 and yet these guys are getting hailed? BUT since it's U2 and Bono is trying to save a whale they'll be in the grammies and every music award possible. Really really sad. The fans should even realize this more and actually make U2 know that whatever it is they're taking now should be stopped. If you guys are REAL fans you should atleast be honest to yourself and to the band that they need some REAL adjustment to do if they wanna continue being big. Wait, what am I saying? It's U2! The most comercialized band ever!!! Whatever album they put out, good or not, they'll still win awards. God, I'm such an idiot. I don't even know why I spent 3 minutes of my time to write this. Bah, nevermind then.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|The one thing I love about this band is that they have changed their sounds from album to album, surprisingly unlike many band's who's debut album is the best and the rest suck, AX7's albums get better with time. <br />This album is great for playing along to with a guitar, the simple dropped d tuning's seperate them from nu-metal (thank god) and the album is the catchiest i've heard in the metal genre in about 10 years.  <br />The highlight of this album is the guitar work in my opinion, it's such talent that not many long time pros can touch it, especially with the solo's in \\"Burn it down.\\" and \\"Seize the day\\"  <br />M. Shadows, lost the screaming for this album so if you're looking foreward to hearing it, don't bother with this album, he actually sings, altho he doesn't have the best voice for singing, he does it with passion, and you can tell. <br />For a band who's first album was made while they were still in highschool, these guys have come a long way. <br />If you didn't like AX7's previous efforts, try this one out, trust me the third time is the charm.
B00005JO0J|5.0|A wonderous vision of the future started in the all too short run of the TV series Firefly continues in the big screen version of it, Serenity. The TV show and movie is about the crew of a star ship that is as much unlike the USS Enterprise as it can get. It's a ranshackle freighter skippered by Mal Reynolds, a man part Han Solo, part Jesse James. He was on the losing side of an intersteller civil war against the Alliance, a buraucratic, oppressive government that seems to consists of people who believe quite fervently they know better than other people how they should live their lives. Captain Reynolds and his motley crew, including his former second in command from the war, her husband the pilot, an engineer who is as cute as she is sharp with the hyper drive, a muscle bound mercenary in a constant state of mutiny, a preacher, a courtesan, and a doctor and his troubled (to say the least!) sister eck out a thin living doing odd jobs out on the frontier, some of them not exactly legal. They bicker and at times almost come to blows. Especialy due to the fact that the doctor's sister is wanted by the Alliance government for having been \\"enhanced\\" and damaged by a top secret government labortory.<br /><br />Oddly enough, this crew might well save the human race among the stars. The story is a paean about how the unlikeliest people can become heroes and how the right of individuals to live free if an absolute. I hope there will be many more films in this \\"verse.\\"
B000001EJ8|3.0|Polydor compiles 15 select tracks from Vangelis's prolific career circa 1996. There are several best of discs out there now, but he is long overdue for a two or three disc, digitally remastered best of. If you do not own any Vangelis, then this compilation would be suitable. However, it misses great tracks that were featured on his 1989 compilation \\"Themes\\" (which also lacked key Vangelis tracks).<br /><br />There were a few annoying features to \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\", namely that all the tracks blend into one another making buring any particular track difficult because you would either get the ending of the last song or the beginning of the next one. Also, \\"Hymn\\" is a remixed version, which in my opinion, is not as good as the version on \\"Themes\\".<br /><br />Otherwise, you have 15 decent tracks gathered together including some of his best work such as \\"Chariots Of Fire\\", \\"I'll Find My Way Home\\", \\"Conquest Of Paradise\\", \\"Antarctica\\" and \\"La Petite Fille De La Mer\\". I'd recommend getting \\"Themes\\" to round out your best of collection as it has some of his other best work. However, \\"Themes\\" is not digitally remastered, and I believe the only way to experience Vangelis's music is digitally remastered.<br /><br />Certainly one of the greatest composers of modern times and a pioneer of new age/electronic music, even beginning before the godfathers of synthetic music, Kraftwerk. Someone needs to get permission from all the record labels and compile a smart two, three or four disc compilation, with no blending of tracks, all songs in their original album form, digitally remastered.
B00005K3O4|5.0|A small subgenre of horror films and literature exists in which one overriding principle dominates: clowns are scary. Think about it for a minute. We've got Stephen King's seminal 1986 novel involving a group of kids battling a cosmic evil that disguises itself in the garb of a clown, subsequently turned into a made for television miniseries a few years later starring Tim Curry as the titular grease painted monster. Then there's Victor Salva's low budget shocker, \\"Clownhouse,\\" about some kids who run into a trio of criminals disguised as clowns. But the best known film involving evil clowns is undoubtedly \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space,\\" a movie that seamlessly blends broad comedy with genuine chills and thrills. Personally, I don't find clowns frightening unless you count the time Roger Moore donned floppy footwear and a red nose in one of his Bond films. But I guess I can understand why some would recoil in fear when confronted by large men with white faces and red smiles, especially if you're a three or four year old kid. Anyway, that's enough with the obligatory paragraph in which I attempt to set some sort of context. Let's move on to the review, shall we?<br /><br />MGM saw fit to release a special edition \\"Killer Klowns\\" disc, and it's a good thing they did. This is one fun ride. The movie starts with the arrival of an odd-looking spacecraft, one shaped like a gigantic circus tent of all things, somewhere in small town America. Right from the start we learn that the occupants of this weird craft resemble not at all the touchy-feely sort of extraterrestrial we saw in films like \\"E.T.\\" These aliens obviously intend to harm any hapless humans with the temerity to investigate the landing of the craft, as evidenced by what happens to a local hick when he takes his dog out to the landing site for a look. Unfortunately, or fortunately considering the outcome of the film, a couple of youngsters also witness the craft arcing through the sky. Enter Mike Tobacco (Grant Cramer) and his girlfriend Debbie Stone (Suzanne Snyder). They were sitting in their car playing tonsil hockey when the spaceship landed nearby. Intrepid Mike immediately wants to investigate, and the reluctant Debbie goes along. The two discover the craft, manage to infiltrate the vessel, and discover a most disturbing find wrapped in what looks like cotton candy. Oh dear. Knowing something is seriously amiss, Mike and Debbie soon find themselves trying to warn the townspeople of the horror from beyond the sky.<br /><br />Their task faces many difficulties. First, the only allies they can rely on are Rich and Paul Terenzi (Michael Siegel and Peter Licassi respectively), two girl crazy dolts that drive an ice cream truck for a living. Debbie and Mike certainly can't count on the local cops for assistance, at least not initially. The chief of police, Curtis Mooney (John Vernon channeling his Dean Wormer character from \\"Animal House\\"), is a hostile man constantly railing against local troublemakers. His main man at the precinct house, Dave Manson (John Allen Nelson), is also unreliable since he once dated Debbie and thus cannot stand Mike's presence. The inability to muster help allows the aliens to sweep into town on a mission of conquest. We soon learn that these extraterrestrials dress and look like clowns, but with a twist. They're hateful creatures with mouths full of nasty looking teeth whose goal involves collecting human beings for food. The aliens use all the clown tricks of the trade--cotton candy, balloons, little cars, shadow puppets, and magic tricks--to capture men, women, and children. Debbie and Mike must avoid the clowns, marshal their forces, and once again penetrate the spaceship in order to save the human race from possible extinction.<br /><br />\\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\" works as well as it does by deftly blending humor with horror. The clowns are fun to watch, especially when they're luring human beings to their doom. Imagine popcorn thatturns into nasty looking beasties with razor sharp teeth, shadow puppets that can swallow up people, and a biker gang that learns the hard way about messing around with these clowns. Fun stuff, even if none of it is particularly scary. What IS scary, at least in my opinion, are the occasional scenes that really send shivers down the spine. That silent clown and the little girl at the restaurant are deliciously eerie, but even this pales in comparison to what I rank as the best scene in the film. It involves Officer Mooney and a clown, and it's bone-chilling stuff. I still shudder every time I see the film and hear Mooney's voice in this particular scene. Just as effective are the set pieces inside the ship, which look like they cost far more than they probably did. That the makers of the movie, the Chiodo brothers, managed to pull off this unusual blend of horror and comedy on such a meager budget speaks well of their talent.<br /><br />Since MGM gives us a special edition disc, there are plenty of extras to peruse after the film concludes. We get a commentary track, deleted scenes, a trailer, stills, audition tapes, bloopers, and five featurettes containing behind the scenes footage, interviews with the Chiodo brothers, and lots of other fun stuff. \\"Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\" is must see viewing for fans of cult cinema, and it's not a bad choice for general horror fans who relish the idea of seeing some chills balanced with a few laughs. The movie is definitely five star material. I'm hoping against hope that the disc sold well enough to merit a sequel. We'll probably never see a follow up film, but I can hope anyway, can't I?n that turns into nasty looking beasties with razor sharp teeth, shadow puppets that can swallow up people, and a biker gang that learns the hard way about messing around with these clowns.

B00005JO0J|5.0|The movie drama created for one of my favorite series was SO awesome.  Mal is up against himself; caught in a web of difficult decisions and a continuing struggle   to keep a cohesive unity to his ever crumbling crew.  River comes to her full fruition.  The Companion, Inora (spelling that wrong I am sure) and Mal flirt with a up an coming story. And the Alliance is turned on its ear.  You gotta watch.  Also maybe pick up the series if your not up on the storyline.  I don't think it is absolutely necessary but it makes the movie mean more.      Who here agrees that the executives who decided to cancel this show at FOX should be fired???
B0007VZ9DK|3.0|I must be blind.  I just don't see what everyone is talking about.  CASINO is not (and let me emphasize \\"not\\") Scorsese's masterpiece.  I don't mean to say that it is a bad picture by any standards, but there is much more depth in Scorsese's catalog than comes to life in this film.<br /><br />CASINO provides an interesting (and long, coming it at three hours) history of Las Vegas in the 1970s.  As in GOODFELLAS, it provides us with a window to the underworld of the Mafia and allows us all to satisfy our desires to explore that world and view it from the comfortable distance of our own homes.  The story, while based on a true account, is not an unfamiliar one to filmgoer's: the tale of two men that get catapulted into the riches and glamour of money, drugs & sex, only to be chewed up, spit out, and left for dead by the business that once supported them.  In the process, they destroy all of the relationships that are near and dear to them and wind up where the story begins.<br /><br />It may seem that I am giving too much of CASINO's architecture away.  But, Scorses wisely employs the audience in this classic storyteller's technique, informing us from the very beginning about where the story will end up (as witnessed by the car bombing of De Niro's car in the opening sequence of the film).  Moreover, and this I was less thrilled with, De Niro provides a layer of dialogue that is peppered throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I did not feel that the dialogue was effective.  Rather, it served to prevent us (in some ways) from getting wrapped up in the storyline and gave the first thirty minutes of the film (where the dialogue is most obtrusive) a bit of an \\"amateur\\" feel.  After all, how tragic can the story be with De Niro providing his own reflective commentary.<br /><br />All of this being said, I did enjoy watching CASINO.  The performances by Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro (in that order) are definitely worth witnessing.  Each of them brings this story alive, despite its slow pacing.  Moreover, the story is a fascinating one, particularly if you enjoy movies about the Mafia.  However, my recommendation would be to watch GOODFELLAS first, as I believe it is a superior film.slow pacing.

B00005JO0J|5.0|***This Review Has NO Spoilers*** <br /> <br />I love the series and I went on opening night to see this. The whole time I was thinking this is one of the most perfect films I've ever seen. You get everything that you expect and more. Oh yeah, if you are a fan of the series and if you know the characters, trust me...you will cry your eyes out. But, I won't tell you why. <br /> <br />FUNNIEST MOMENT OF THE FILM WITHOUT TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS... <br /> <br />The scene where Inara is praying before Buddha, listen carefully to what Mal says... <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT! I LOVE KAYLEE!!! <br /> <br />That's all I'm saying...
B000059T1E|5.0|John Barleycorn is probably Traffic's strongest record. I have a continuing fondness for all things psychedelic, and 1968's \\"Dear Mr.Fantasy\\" is one of my favorites from its golden age. But I'm afraid I prefer this funky, jazzy thing more. I think Mason's contributions to Traffic are of far less import than Winwood's, Mason being too mystical and British for my liking-and his departure allowed Winwood to become the near one-man show we all know he is capable of stealing.
B00005JO0J|5.0|If you were thinking that Joss Whedon wrote and directed \\"Serenity\\" to be the first in a series of movies based on the crew of his late and lamented television series \\"Firefly,\\" think again.  Whedon knows this might be his only bite of the cinematic apple for his creations, so fans will see this being more like the series finales of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel.\\"  In other words, not everybody is going to be around for the final credits.<br /><br />To get everybody on the same page Whedon begins with Simon (Sean Maher) breaking his sister River (Summer Glau) out of the Alliance laboratory where they are busy playing with her brain.  River is both a psychic and a living weapon, and it turns out that it is the former that is of the biggest concern to the Alliance because she knows something she should not know.  That knowledge, rattling around in her head, is part of the reason that River is mentally unstable, and so the Alliance has sent an Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who has neither a name nor an official position, to bring her back.  Then we jump to Serenity and a tracking shot in which the boat's captain, Mal (Nathan Fillion) starts in the cock pit with Wash (Alan Tudyk), and then walks all the way through the crew deck and returns back through the cargo deck, meeting Zoe (Gina Torres), Jayne (Adam Baldwin), and Kaylee (Jewel Statie), along with Simon and River along the way.  Inara (Morena Baccarin) and Shepherd Book (Ron Glass) are no longer aboard, but rest assured they will pop up.  So, Mal has River and the Alliance wants her, so the Operative is coming to get her and he is coming \\"sideways.\\"<br /><br />Mal Reynolds is in the reluctant hero Han Solo/Rick Blaine mold; he and Zoe fought against the Alliance in the war and now his entire world is Serenity.  His crew is his top priority and the Alliance is making a big mistake in forcing him to care about larger issues.  Besides, he has an ace, or at least a wild card, up his sleeve with River.  So the character arc of the captain is certainly a familiar one.  But one of Whedon's chief attributes is that he likes to play with established conventions.  Every time you think that you are ahead of the characters and that Mal does not know what is about to happen next, you are wrong.  So it is nice to play with expectations and Whedon does so, to provide not only humor but some pathos as well (Whedon likes to make you laugh and then give you a reason to suddenly stop laughing).<br /><br />Yes, those of us familiar with \\"Firefly\\" have an advantage in watching \\"Serenity\\" because we know the characters, not only in terms of their histories but also their temperaments.  That is why we were expecting a lot more cursing in Chinese in this movie.  We are also going to be more accepting of attempts to fast forward some of the interpersonal issues that afflict the crew of Serenity, as well as the attempt to suggest what is to come down the road.  Whedon could get bogged down in trying to finally untangle the love-hate affair that Mal and Inara have been having, but he rightly keeps the focus on working out the River plotline.  Most of the crewmembers of Serenity get their moments, but this film comes down to Mal and River, which is what both the television series and the prologue here have set up.  I am perfectly willing to grant that such insider knowledge is worth at least a half-star in terms of rating this film, but that is just the way things break with this movie.<br /><br />Ultimately, I ended up rounding up on \\"Serenity\\" because in the sequences where River goes to town Whedon uses long shots to depict the action.  Yes, it could be that he is cutting or morphing together shots of the living weapon at work, but I am so sick and tired of seeing fight sequences reduced to a rapid fire montage of cuts where I can never tell what is going on.  It seems that you do not get to see what is really happening in a fight unless it is not really happening because you are using CGIfor your fights (a prime example being Spider-man versus Doctor Octopus in \\"Spider-man 2\\").  But when River takes her turn we get to see what she is doing and enjoy her whirling ballet of death and one of the joys here is watching Glau turn off the crazy little girl routine and show exactly what the Alliance has created.  In other words, Whedon provides the payoff we were denied when \\"Firefly\\" was summarily cancelled after only eleven episodes had aired, which is exactly what the mission was here.<br /><br />Final Note: Stick around for the entire credits and you will get to hear the \\"Fireside\\" theme song as a nice little acoustic guitar piece.re using CGI for your fights (a prime example being Spider-man versus Doctor Octopus in \\"Spider-man 2\\").

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I can listen to the song \\"Chariot\\" over and over again, and I won't get tired of the tune.   I first got to know Gavin DeGraw from Z100, playing his \\"I Don't Want to Be\\", and the lyrics interest me, \\"I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately\\".  Later on, I've been hearing \\"Chariot\\" playing, then I started to say, \\"Hey, this is a true talented artist!\\".  Nice album!
B00005JNQS|4.0|The strength and weakness of \\"Robots\\" is found in the revelation somewhere in the special features that the genesis for the 2005 film was the idea to do a computer animated movie about robots.  This led to production designer William Joyce coming up with robots inspired by outboard engines and metal items found around the house rather than the cinematic traditions represented by \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Forbidden Planet.\\"  Listening to how they came up with the \\"generations\\" of robots was fascinating and you can see how once they latched on the idea there were inspired to come up with all of the delightful creations we see on screen.  Consequently the characters pretty much came before the story and while director Chris Wedge and co-director Carlos Saldanha (the \\"Ice Age\\" team) have created a wonderful world, the story being told does not rise to the same level (to wit, it needs an upgrade).<br /><br />The irony is that why the character designs work on two level so that adults can enjoy them in a different way from the kiddies, does not apply to the story, which is programmed for the short set (despite the cinematic and cultural references that only older viewers can get) and based on a simple message written large and hammered repeatedly: you should follow your dreams.  The dreamer in this case is young Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGregor), an inventor, who leaves Rivet Town for the big metropolis of Robot City, to work for his hero Bigweld (Mel Brooks).  Rodney leaves behind his parents, Herb (Stanley Tucci), a dishwasher, and Mrs. Copperbottom (Dianne Wiest), and the initial problem is that Herb needs spare parts that are no longer available.  Rodney discovers this is because of a larger problem: Bigweld has disappeared and in his place are Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) and his evil mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), who want all of the robots in the world to upgrade or go to the scrap heap.<br /><br />I have to stop and wonder if younger viewers will make any connection between Ratchet and Gasket's grand plan and the Nazi designs for helping along the creation of a master race through the practice of eugenics.  Or will they simply see this as just another example of the economic imperative for things to become new and improved?  There is a larger lesson here, but \\"Robots\\" just takes the evil at face value with the undesirable result that the villains are too buffonish to be really evil but doing things that are evil enough that their humor rings hollow.  If the success of a film ultimately rests on the villains, then \\"Robots\\" is at a disadvantage for anyone who is a bit along in grade school.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy Robin Williams jumping off into the deep end of the pool casting him as the voice of Fender works against \\"Robots\\" as far as I am concerned.  None of the other supporting characters stand a chance as long as he is around, and most of the better bits in the film gravitate towards his character.  Only Jennifer Coolidge's Aunt Fanny provides any real competition, and that is mainly because that baby has back, although Paul Giamatti as Tim the Gate Guard has a nice scene, but they really should have spread the wealth a lot more given the rich characters they created.  The other thing that bothered me was that I wanted Rodney to end up with Piper (Amanda Bynes) rather than Cappy (Halle Berry), because I thought they were the more appropriate pairing given Rodney's youth and the way the film is geared for the kiddies.  But \\"Robots\\" is totally locked into the formula by that point in the film.  The best thing that can be said about this film is that if \\"Robots\\" is an average computer animated film, then that still constitutes an above average film.will make any connection between Ratchet and Gasket's grand plan and the Nazi designs for helping along the creation of a master race through the practice of eugenics.

B000001GXJ|5.0|Simon Boccanegra is mainly an opera for the male voices although Mirella Freni as Amelia/Maria puts in a very good performance. This gives the opera a sort of a \\"darker air\\", although not gloomy. Unlike many other Verdi operas this one does not contain any arias that are instantly recognizable, but instead you'll have hauntingly beautiful music throughout the entire opera.        This recording of Simon Boccanegra from 1977 is blessed with superb singers so you can hardly go wrong buying it. Jos Carreras sounds so wonderfully fresh and secure; it's as if his voice could do anything he wanted it to - without straining it the least bit. And that sensual sounding, honeyed voice he's so famous for is most evident in this recording; and not to mention powerful. He's singing on full blast, going on and on and reaching newer heights without the slightest effort. You can just indulge yourself in his voice. I'm loosing track of everything else when listening to it. Listen to the aria \\"Oh Amelia ami\\" and you'll probably understand what I'm talking about.                 In this aria you'll also hear my favourite baritone, the now late Piero Cappucilli who sings the part of Simon Boccanegra. He's probably one of the best Boccanegra's on disc ever. He's truly involved in the play and in my opinion he possessed one of the most beautiful baritones. It's like velvet on your senses.      Mirella Freni is perfect as Amelia/Maria. In my opinion her voice is very suitable for this kind of repertoire. I don't like the voices that are just \\"loud\\" and nothing more. That's why I like Freni, because she is capable of doing more with her voice than just unsubtle screaming all around. Also, her voice blends just perfect with Carreras' and they create moments of pure bliss throughout the entire opera. I just love the aforementioned \\"Oh Amelia ami\\", but listen to \\"cielo di stelle orbato\\" as well and you'll hear some really fantastic singing.     The rest of the cast also belong tothe group of celebrated opera singers. The wonderful basso Nicolai Ghiaurov as Jacapo Fiesco is just perfect. The duet with Carreras \\"Propizio ei giunge\\" is one of the arias you would like hearing over and over again. Jos Van Dam as Paolo Albiani is equally good. I have actually not been able to find a weak spot - or a bad singer - in this opera. This is solid work from beginning to end from both the composer and all the singers.
B000BI5LGO|5.0|If they made a live-action \\"Dilbert\\" movie, it might resemble \\"Office Space\\" -- a hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of \\"Beavis & Butthead\\" fame). Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job.<br /><br />Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waitress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.<br /><br />The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly deranged employee who complains that \\"you took my stapler.\\" This time, Milton is a minor character, although a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.<br /><br />Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (\\"Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhh...\\"). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And of course, the dialogue is quietly insane (\\"Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day...\\") as the plot grows ever tenser.<br /><br />The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his rage at his rotten job. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment that he has the same name as THAT singer. Jennifer Aniston does a pretty good job as a love interest for Peter -- a waittress who hates her job as much as he hates his.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles. Make more movies, Mike Judge -- especially if they're as good as \\"Office Space.\\"Samir, who can barely restrain his rage at his rotten job.

B00005JO0J|5.0|For fans of the prematurely cancelled \\"Firefly\\" series, Joss Whedon's \\"Serenity\\" will be an early Christmas present, full of delightful touches, references to the series, and hints about answers we have longed looked for.<br /><br />Unlike many television shows transferred to the big screen, however, \\"Serenity\\" is a movie that can stand on its own merit as a solid space opera, enjoyable for everyone, not just \\"Firefly\\" geeks. It also proves that a good movie doesn't require star-power; \\"Serenity\\" boasts no superstar names or big-time directors, but the performances are all heartfelt, with a quality of realness and depth frequently lacking in genre movies. Unlike the Star Wars prequels, we can believe the characters of \\"Serenity\\" are not only real, but are like us. Indeed, Whedon has a sense of classic space opera that Lucas should envy.<br /><br />Joss Whedon's vision of the future - once described to me as \\"Star Wars, but Han Solo's world, with Han still shooting first\\" - is possibly the most original I've encountered in movies of this kind, an amalgam of Westerns, science fiction, and classic fantasy, sprinkled liberally with Chinese culture. This is a world where characters dress like cowboys, fly spaceships, and curse in Mandarin. But despite this seemingly non sequitur mix, Whedon manages to blend it all into a cohesive, engaging whole.<br /><br />And how it does engage! The film opens with a lesson on the colonization of other worlds - in a process called \\"terraforming,\\" supposedly making other planets similarly inhabitable to \\"Earth-that-was\\" - and how the Alliance (a powerful and hyper-controlling government coalition) made war on the lesser colonists, the Independence movement (or \\"Browncoats\\"). The Alliance won. Now the war is discussed in sterile classrooms, where the children don't understand why anyone would resist the \\"progressive\\" Alliance.<br /><br />Nobody except a young girl named River Tam, that is. She is precocious, sensitive, brilliant; we sense she is probably too smart for her own good. And this proves true as we are jolted from the bright white summer classroom to an unfriendly blue-lit lab, where an older River is being experimented on by the Alliance. Doctors have taken her natural intelligence and grace and made her a weapon, a deeply empathetic psychic with extraordinary gifts as a \\"Reader\\" and an assassin's knack for martial arts combat. The side-effects of this procedure have left River prone to psychotic episodes, a damaged and mentally fragile seventeen-year old who says things that even she doesn't understand.<br /><br />Her brother Simon, a talented doctor, rescues her from this (at the expense of his career and his fortune), and from this rescue the film's perspective shifts again, this time to a nameless Operative whose sole purpose is to capture River and bring her back. He is a \\"believer,\\" with a dangerous conviction that finding River is necessary to bring about the utopia he envisions as the future, and an unshakable belief that nothing is too great a sacrifice in his quest. He will find River and kill her, and if doing so means killing everyone in his way, then that is an acceptable sacrifice. Nothing, it seems, is more dangerous than belief.<br /><br />What he does not know is that River and Simon have been hiding on the spaceship Serenity. Serenity's crew are a strange mix: warrior woman Zoe, geeky pilot Wash, gentle and sweet mechanic Kaylee, and Jayne, a blunt, man's man type who loves his guns but has his tender moments too. Leading this ragtag crew is Captain Mal Reynolds, a man of great determination, who we sense is at heart a good man, but not without flaws. They speak in a blend of nineteenth-century Western, futuristic tech-talk,  and Whedon's trademark dry, wacky humor; \\"Serenity\\" may just have the most original dialogue this year. Most of the characters are drawn in broad strokes - there is not the time in a two-hour movie for \\"Firefly\\"'s development-heavy style - but theyengage our emotions in a surprisingly deep way; by the time bad things start happening to them, we care. Very much.<br /><br />And happen they do, often in ways we are not expecting. The plot is many-layered and complex; it will suffice to say that River, a psychic exposed to a roomful of government officials, knows terrible secrets that the Alliance wants contained at any cost. Keeping River from the Alliance Operative and trying to discover the truth about what horrific knowledge is eating at her brain provides the framework for the action, of which there is a great deal, forming a sort of highly-engrossing space chase that Lucas only dreams of.<br /><br />There are no aliens in \\"Serenity.\\" The principal enemy is the Alliance and its nameless assassin, but there are other foes as well. The most horrific of these are the Reavers, a gruesome, nearly-mythological band of mutilated men. They were once human, we are told, but having gone to the furthest reaches of space despaired and forgot themselves, cutting on their own flesh and cannibalizing others. The truth, as we learn, is more simple and more harrowing.<br /><br />It is touches like these that make Whedon's world simultaneously so familiar and so foreign, and ultimately so fascinating to watch. \\"Serenity\\" succeeds not only as a space adventure, full of strange sights and stirring battles, but as a character-driven story that grabs us, pulls us in, and forces us to care about its people. It delivers on both counts with a gripping, homespun immediacy unlike anything else I've seen.<br /><br />A warning for devoted Browncoats: there are moments that will make you laugh, moments that will shock you, and moments that you will deny until the end. I haven't cried this much in a movie since \\"Return of the King\\" - and I am not one who routinely weeps at the movies. I also haven't laughed this much at the movies this year. \\"Serenity\\" has joy and sorrow, humor and pain, loss and sacrifice and gain. Whedon has succeeded in crafting an elegant, gripping story that fully captures our imaginations and our hearts. Here's hoping there are many more to come.by the time bad things start happening to them, we care. Very much.     And happen they do, often in ways we are not expecting.

B000A7Q2DM|5.0|When 30 Seconds to Mars first came to my attention, I was a huge huge fan of their first album - very loud, rock-y kind of music produced by a band who obviously know what they're doing, so I was weary when people told me that the new album was different. <br /> <br />However, that said, A Beautiful Lie is a very different sound and it's just as amazing as before, if not more-so. The sounds have very definatley matured over time and it's an amazing album that can't be praised highly enough. There's still very much the same kind of edge that 30STM fans are familiar with, but with the new lyrics, mellower music and change of pace, it's not more of the same, which just makes it even more endearing to the listener. I would, and have, reccomend it to everyone.  <br /> <br />
0395951054|4.0|There is enough hate in this book towards the French, Russians, Communists, Socialists, Germans (many,but definitely not all), the Hapsburgs, and especially those who (as the dictator writes) cannot hate their enemies enough. Obviously the Jews get special treatment,and it gets as ugly as you think. The freemasons and other smaller organizations get their share too. But all that is no surprise. The early life story in his own words of this \\"ferocious genius\\" (as Churchill said) is certainly worth the price of the book, and most ofthe first part covers his days in the Great War, and in Vienna, with descriptions of this beautiful yet unforgiving and nasty metropolis just before and after the war, and his rabble-rousing in the army and in Munich from 1919-1923, when the book was written. He is obviously disease obsessed, part of the beginnings of his vicious anti-semitism, since he blames the Jews for spreading Syphilis. Obviously he is very well read on history, art, music, and architechiture, and in some passages, this book is astounding!. But as a record of some very lucid and very sick ideas from a genius/madman, this book is surely in  a league of its own!

B000001FA4|4.0|1. IT'S NOT A POP ALBUM -- And U2 were not originally a poprock band. U2 rose from the ashes of the punk explosion, into what we Americans call \\"new wave.\\" But it was a different type of new wave without synthesizers or glossy production. People complain that there aren't enough choruses or catchy hooks on the Unforgettable Fire. In case you didn't know, that's the tired pop format, a commercial format preferred by the music industry because they believe that you the listener cannot absorb, let alone comprehend any song that's longer than 3 minutes or doesn't have a memorable chorus or repetetive melody. The Unforgettable Fire isn't a rock record or a pop record. Those terms are too simple and limiting. Instead, U2 created a MUSIC PIECE. It's experimental, sweeping, majestic, ambient and beautiful. Most of the songs have an untraditional arrangement and follow odd formats. The familiar verse/chorus/verse/chorus formula doesn't apply here. This is the album where U2 first reinvented themselves and first truly challenged mainstream rock and pop. WAR was a fierce, straight ahead rock record. Instead of recording a WAR Part II, U2 instead released an album that defied convention at the time. If you're used to commercial music, then you're going to have a hard time understanding the significance of this album. That is why college radio loved The Unforgettable Fire album, but mainstream American radio was tougher to win over, and that didn't happen until The Joshua Tree was released with it's more mainstream format. <br /> <br />2. REMEMBER THAT THIS IS 1984 -- Music that was making the airwaves at this time was relegated to the glossy \\"haircut bands\\" like Kajagoogoo, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, OMD, etc. The only alternatives to this kind of romantic synthesizer pop was The Smiths, The Cure, REM and of course The Clash. The Smiths, The Cure and The Clash followed a format that was punk inspired, while REM hailed from the indie scene. U2 on the other hand were in a category unto themselves. Making another WAR album would have trapped them into a category and stunted their growth as artists. The Unforgettable Fire with it's classical and European influences was the only real answer to that kind of artistic stagnation. That's when you start to appreciate what Brian Eno brought to the table during the recording sessions. The majority of the album was recorded in a castle, making use of natural materials and acoustics, a locale which was then unheard of at the time. There's a sense of space, a natural ambience that helps to paint a mental picture within the listener. It's cinematic music, slightly vague in lyrical content, but emotionally vivid. The music of the Unforgettable Fire and Brian Eno is those things. It's also about artistry, experimentation and nullifying categories. So was David Bowie's music, which Eno produced in the 1970s. People are quick to call this kind of music \\"weird.\\" It's only weird because YOU don't understand it. Bono or The Edge were once quoted as saying something like \\"Art rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s went to art school. We went to Brian Eno.\\" This album was ground breaking for 1984, and it still holds up today as a classic because few bands have made anything like it since.  <br /> <br />THIS IS AN ALBUM, NOT A COLLECTION OF SONGS -- What I mean is, you have to look at the entire collection as one canvas, one piece of art. How do you view a piece of art and properly appreciate it? I believe you research the making of the piece, the history behind it, the locale, what else was going on at the time, the story behind it, etc. The audience is supposed to actually THINK about it, not just look at it because it's a \\"pretty picture\\" or listen to it because it's a \\"cool sounding CD.\\"
B000AL730O|2.0|With the caveat that I'm a big fan of the Beatles, Wings and even McCartney solo material from the 1980s, I have to say that this is one of the most disappointing McCartney CDs.  Yes, there are three or so good songs (\\"Fine Line\\", \\"Too Much Rain\\", \\"Promise to You Girl\\"), but after listening to the CD almost daily for the last week, I can't say that majority are particularly memorable.      The music has the introspective and at times sad sound similar to his recent work (Flaming Pie and Driving Rain), but thanks to producer Nigel Godrich it's much more polished.  On the other hand, the song writing isn't as good.  A few songs, such as \\"English Tea\\" and \\"Jenny Wren\\", remind one of previous McCartney ballads, but I don't think they would have made the \\"B\\" side of a 70s Wings' single.    I know some will think I'm unfair to this CD, but just compare \\"Anyway\\" to \\"Only Love Remains\\" on 1986's Press to Play.  Both have the line \\"Only Love is Strong Enough,\\" but Anyway follows with \\"to take it on the chin.\\"  Ugh.  Press to Play may have been a low point for McCartney, but compared to this CD it had more flashes of McCartney's song writing ability.
B00005A1PR|4.0|Ok. I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5 just because I'm not a liberal when it comes to giving out the twinkles. But I must say that this is a pretty good album. India is more than a singer she's also an artist. Unlike many of albums I was able to listen to this album in it's entirety. My favorite songs on this album are Video,  Back to the middle, and Nature. I like Video because she seems to be a girl after my own heart. I like Come back to the middle because it focuses on balance (It's as important to have a balanced mind as it is a balanced meal). And last but not least I love Nature because it's great advice for those entering into relationships.

B0000DD7LC|1.0|Well I did not purchase this album but  the songs that they played on the radio over and over and over again did not grab my attention. What's up with the song where she sings \\"You don't know my name\\" Well in that song says \\"and when we had our first kiss...\\" Well if he don't know your name how did you to have your first kiss. Her writing ability is overated. She can sing alright and play the piano but lyrically she's not representing. But that's just my opinion.

Super actions scenes, great dialogue.  The bank robbery - loved it.<br /><br />The lines are hilarious!  Mal is Mal, Jane is Jane, Kaley's herself, the writing and directing was true and funny and as smart as ever.  River's mystery is finally out of the bag.  The villain was superbly villanous, and a \\"believer\\" in his own cause.  Reevers are scarier than ever.<br /><br />This reminded me of the first Star Wars movie.  It had it all.  Their visit to Miranda also reminded me of some of the old original Star Trek episodes.  Superb twists in Mal's strategies.<br /><br />If I had any complaints, Inara's role was tiny.  Her lines were few.  And Shepherd's mystery is still a mystery.  Everything else rocked.  I hope it goes to number One this weekend.
B000A78Z82|4.0|I recently bought a slew of new albums, this being one of about five. And among that rainfall of music, this one stands out as the clear winner. Devendra first piqued my curiosity with Nino Rojo-and while I love that record, it was definitely a mood piece-something to put on in the middle of a very quiet night alone. I didn't want anyone else to hear it. Cripple Crow is like the lovely Sunday morning after that long dark winter night. The first comparison that comes up is something along the lines of George Harrison's great sprawling post-Beatles work. But I never felt like I could claim that music as my own in the way I can with Devendra.  <br /> <br />Now lest you think I'm some hirsute hippy making daisy chains and soaking in patchouli, I am a huge Melvins fan and vehement post-hippy (I can't really call myself anti- as I went to school in Santa Cruz and I have some hippies in my family). Devendra goes above and beyond any labels as quaint as \\"freak folk\\" or \\"hippy\\". He's just making great music. <br /> <br />The sound of Cripple Crow is open and warm. It's like being invited to a big late summer feast at Devendra's house. It goes well with wine. It sounds like September. It needs to be played over and over again (I'm trying not to wear it out). And his Spanish-sung tunes are just fantastic: a little bit of Caetano, a little Gilberto Gil, with that same childlike warbly Devendra voice.  <br /> <br />Buy it now!!!

0757302661|5.0|As opposed to Henci Goer's \\"Thinking Woman's Guide to Better Birth\\", which scares you into wanting a natural birth by making pretty much all intervention sound ghoulish and dangerous, this book makes you want a natural birth because of the beautiful experience that the author describes when talking about her own hypnobirth and the other births that she's been involved in.  I can only speak for myself but I respond far better to positive motivation.   <br /> <br />The philosophy behind this method and the book makes good sense: women have been having babies for thousands of years, our bodies are designed to do it, and a lot of the pain in labor comes from being conditioned to be afraid of it.  You get scared, you tense up, and it hurts.  When I went to my obstetrician today, I asked her what natural birth method has been the best in her experience, and she said that all her hypnobirths have been \\"beautiful\\".  What can I say?  I'm sold.  I'm having a hypnobaby!
B00006469V|3.0|Solti can't punch Parsifal up with excitement as he did the Ring, given the nature of the music, which is mostly slow and lacking in vocal set pieces - there are famous episodes, of course, like the Grail Knights' marches, the Good Friday Spell, and the climactic ceremony when Parsifal returns with the Holy Spear. Certainly Solti does a more than creditable job throughout but without indicating, to me at least, that this is a religious opera. It's just Solti doing his Wagner thing at lower voltage with the splendid Vienna Phil. creating glorious sounds. Even there, the Prelude to Act I suffers from some coarse, loud playing.<br /><br />Although he sounds vocally secure (especially by today's diminished standards)and youthful in timbre, Rene Kollo is a callow hero--one gets almost no sense of his spiritual growth through disillusion and agony. On the positive side, Kollo's \\"Amfortas! Die Wunde\\" is impassioned, and if the voice seemed light for the role, Kollo's successors over the years were even lighter or else vocally insecure. I just wished that I liked his voice more; there's a grating quality to it that puts me off. Kollo doesn't have either the vocal richness nor the nobility of character to fully carry off the final scene; he's half an epiphany short.<br /><br />Gottlob Frick, a great deep bass, sounds fairly old and somewhat woolly as Gurnemanz, and the blackness in his tone tends to recall Hagen and Hunding rather than a holy knight. As professional as Frick is, and with his natural vocal authority, he doesn't rise ecstatically to the epiphany of Act III's Good Friday scene. The rest of the cast is excellent, but particularly Christa Ludwig as a resplendent Kundry--this was one of her best Wagner roles.

B00005JNQS|4.0|From the people that brought us the delightful ICE AGE comes this somewhat entertaining ROBOTS.  While not as consistently excellent as ICE AGE, this movie nevertheless pulls off some amazing animation and a few truly clever moments.  A young robot with designs on becoming an inventor leaves small town life behind and heads for the big city to meet his idol, Bigweld.  However, a nasty takeover has taken place with the evil Ratchet who wants to do upgrades instead of repairs so spare parts have been outlawed.  Of course the young upstart is out to save the world and keep the older robots in replacement parts.  Excellent voices are provided by Robin Williams (as the frenetic Fender), Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Mel Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge, Dianne Weist and others.  Although the pacing is sometimes erratic and slow, ROBOTS manages to be an entertainment the whole family should enjoy.
078322804X|5.0|When &#34;The Blues Brothers&#34; arrived in the summer of 1980, most critics attacked its $27 million budget - believing the musical-comedy would flop as badly as Steven Spielberg's &#34;1941.&#34; They were wrong. In fact, the intervening years have been kind to the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd cult classic, which can be seen in a better light thanks to John Landis' &#34;director's cut.&#34; Exhibitors balked at the original 2 1/2-hour running time and forced Landis to trim 20 minutes for theatrical release. Happily, the musical performances have been gloriously expanded on DVD — notably Aretha Franklin's &#34;Think,&#34; James Brown's &#34;The Old Landmark&#34; and the powerful John Lee Hooker segment. As a result, the emphasis lies more on rhythm and blues than outlandish car chases. No matter what version you see, &#34;The Blues Brothers&#34; is great fun from beginning to end.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|Scorsese has a knack for taking music as a subject and making a movie that actually has a point. This is in stark contrast with almost any other director's attempts at filming something music related, be it a concert or documentary.  <br /> <br />\\"Typical\\" music-based movies feature audience shots, mindless rambling, and an assorted amount of throw-away footage. Most viewers find this stuff horrible - a lesson Scorsese learned as an assistant director on Woodstock: the movie. One could argue that Scorsese wrote the book on how to film a concert with The Last Waltz - the first concert to be filmed in 32mm, to have storyboards, and to have a set designed by Hollywood professionals. After the Last Waltz, Robbie Robertson lived with Scorsese for a little over a year, where they would trade artistic criticism and new ideas. I gather it is precisely because Scorsese truly sees Dylan as an artist that the normally secretive Dylan gave Scorsese the time of day. <br /> <br />With that little pre-amble out of the way, on to the film at hand: For a Scorsese film the message is pretty clear, though I would argue that its presence is something many other directors would fail to achieve. The tone for the film is set early when Joan Baez describes Dylan telling her in the early 60s that someday people will be searching for meaning in his songs, when really they weren't about anything in particular. While that statement is likely not entirely true (who can say for sure besides Bob himself?) the notion of an artist's intent is brought to the forefront.  <br /> <br />A bit of background on the subject: Socrates refused to write anything down for fear of misinterpretation. The idea has been articulated and rearticulated over the last two and a half thousand years - once an artist dies, his audience can freely interpret his work. Take for example Shakespeare - who can't remember learning about the notions of tragic hero and tragic flaw and how Shakespeare is a pure genius for intendingevery other letter in one of his plays to spell some cryptic messages (sorry, that's the bible). When in reality the notion of tragic hero was invented by AC Bradley two hundred years after Shakespeare died, and probability suggests that in any document as long as the bible such coincidences occur (the occur in Moby Dick for example, but enough of the aside).  <br /> <br />What is the point? This movie answers the questions \\"what is it like to be Bob Dylan?\\" \\"what is it like to be a pop star?\\" and \\"what is it like to be an artist?\\" Such a life is to have your work constantly scrutinized, with both credit and blame falsely attributed to you. If you happen to be alive at the time of your popularity, such a life is filled with people demanding more of the same, a direct contradiction to the very artistic freedom that led you to such fame. Case in point, during one of the press conferences in part two, someone asks for an explanation of one of the pictures on an album cover, explaining that he had given much thought to its deeper meaning and the placement of a motorcycle. Or at another conference when someone asks Dylan how many folk singers there are (Dylan responds \\"136\\").  <br /> <br />In short the point Scorsese is trying to make is the same point Dylan tried to make in 1966: an artist performs his craft with little explanation. The audience has to make something of it without necessarilly a hand to hold onto. The irony of the situation is how abindantly clear Dylan's message in 1965 and 1966 was in hindsight. Opening Newport in 1965 with lyrics like \\"I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Farm no more,\\" and singing \\"it's all over now, baby blue\\" was no coincidence. In England in 1966, at the time during the sets when the booing would get out of control, Dylan would be singing lyrics like \\"something is happening, but you don't know what it is.\\"  <br /> <br />To summarize, this film is a well made neoclassical depiction of a modern Shakespeare. To Shakespeare fans out there, not only is that comparison not overblown (I personally think Dylan is the greatest writer of the 20th century, and there are certainly people who would disagree with that claim and others who would defend it, but that is neither here nor there), but perhaps no other writers have been as scrutinized and misinterpreted as William Shakespeare and Bob Dylan.  <br /> <br />Perhaps after the new wave of attention the power that be will grant Scorsese the Oscar he deserves, and Bob Dylan the Nobel Prize (he has been nominated several times) he deserves.
B000001ZS5|4.0|Jean Michel Jarre emphasizes his wonderful creativity in Music Concrete.  His beautiful electronic melodies are enhanced even more by articulate environmental sounds and voices.  A definite 5 stars, minus 1 star for the corny Kimball organ music on the final track.
B000003CUJ|2.0|Decades ago, Leopold Stokowski popularized opera for the general public through \\"symphonic syntheses.\\" These included Wagner's Ring, Triastan, and Boris Godunov, to mention those I've heard and enjoyed. I was prepared to enjoy Maazel's modern update and expected a fun ride through the gorgeous sonorities of Wagner's score.<br /><br />Not much enjoyment resulted, however. Maazel is superficial, often ponderous, and much too roughshod with this pastische. It can't all be crash and bang. So I threw the CD away and hope a few others won't make the mistake I did.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is Radiohead's best album, and that says a lot considering Radiohead is a great band.  This album definetly does deserve 5 stars.  When I first purchased the album, I wasn't completely fond of how it sounded.  However, after several listens, I felt mesmorized by each song.  In fact \\"Climbing up the walls\\" is one of my favorite songs despite the fact that it annoyed me the first few times I listened to it.  Radiohead is an acquired taste, and if you're someone who judges music after one listen, this is not the CD nor is it the band for you.  On the other hand, if you are open minded and willing to give OK Computer more than one play, you are in for a treat.
B00005JODA|5.0|Adapted from John Le Carr?'s novel, Fernando Meirelles' The Constant Gardener benefits greatly from Ralph Fiennes' presence as a diplomat whose young wife, an activist interested in humanitarian causes in Africa, is brutally murdered. Investigating her death he discovers that she was involved in a corruption scandal involving a drug with potentially fatal side effects, its powerful manufacturer, and two governments.<br /><br />All the familiar targets of paranoid conspiracy thrillers are here and the complex plot is presented with surprising clarity by a literate script. Fiennes and Rachel Weisz as his wife lift The Constant Gardener above the level of the average spy movie through their luminous performances. The former's resolute attempt to keep his composure at the moment he is informed of her murder is just one highlight among many. Ultimately what makes this film memorable is that it is not just about murder, betrayal, greed and corruption at the highest levels of government, but about two real people, who love each other but don't know a great deal about their individual lives.<br /><br />While the documentary-style camerawork lends the film a sense of gritty verisimilitude that increases its power, and the African scenes are especially vivid, the viewer must be warned that the cumulative effect of so much shaky hand-held camerawork gave this moviegoer a headache and queasy stomach. Go and enjoy, but not after a large dinner.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|...although it wasn't all that bad.<br /><br />The issues?<br /><br />-The script wasn't that good, kinda long, and rather boring.<br /><br />-Val Kilmer was not the best Batman. He definitely cannot come in as the worst (George Clooney recieves that honor), but he ain't the best.<br /><br />-Sex appeal is great and all, and Nicole Kidman is sexy. But the down-to-earth ideal of Vickie Val and the evil twist of Catwoman were much better. Nicole Kidman was just too... revved up. She was in love with Bruce, but she \\"wanted Batman.\\" They should have made her more like Vickie: sexy, yet down-to-Earth. Then this would not have been such a problem.<br /><br />-Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/Two-Face was not the best villian portrayal of all time.<br /><br />-It seems they cut out the idea that Harvey Dent and Bruce were friends until Harvey became evil. I liked that ideal from the comics, and it would have been an interesting portrayal, here.<br /><br />-Tim Burton's vision of Gotham was much better.<br /><br />It's upshots?<br /><br />-More Alfred (YEAH!)<br /><br />-Jim Carrey as the Riddler was incredibly well-done. Just another role to prove that Jim is an incredible actor.<br /><br />-Nice actions sequences.<br /><br />-A great soundtrack.<br /><br />-The story of how Bruce's parents died is much better than the original.<br /><br />3-stars is the most I can give this with all it's problems. But trust me, after what Schumacher proved about his directing skills with Batman and Robin, 3-stars is a good rating.
1573223026|3.0|The concept is fascinating: four strangers who meet on a rooftop in the midst of contemplating suicide and form a bond that goes beyond  class, gender and age.  Sadly, the book really did not deliver.  While the first part of the book, as the characters are introduced is humorous and insightful, the book rapidly becomes maudlin and a the characters become flat line-drawings -- the stereoptypical wastrel trying to do good, the stereotypical American wanna-be rocker, the stereotypical angsty-teen-girl, the stereotypical housewife.  The characters wander around a little overly-self-aware, a little too melodramatic (even for near-suicides) and continue on a little too easily.
B00007BH3Y|4.0|Philip Glass' score \\"The Hours\\" gets to the heart of both Michael Cunningham's poetic novel and the 2002 film but is rich enough to stand on its own. Glass' music expresses motion and contemplation, the stuff of Cunningham's characters (the real-life Mrs. Woolf, Mrs. Brown and the modern-day Mrs. Dalloway) and the stuff of life, and could well be the soundtrack of the fire inside every woman's soul. Its haunting melodies (mostly piano with strings) convey passion, longing, and danger. The tracks are sometimes tedious with a see-saw (sometimes pulsating) rhythm, but beautiful nonetheless. Most memorable are the tracks, \\"Morning Passages,\\" \\"The Kiss,\\" and \\"The Poet Acts.\\" <br /> <br />The liner notes are a thick booklet, with a very personal introduction by Michael Cunningham, in which the book's author delves into the not-so-obvious relationship between music and literature. Also included are color photos from the film and excerpts from the novel. <br /> <br />Other great film scores I recommend: The Age of Innocence by Elmer Bernstein, The Piano by Michael Nyman, and anything by Thomas Newman (particularly the new-ish Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events).
B000022TSW|5.0|Hilariously irreverent movie that manages to offend the Middle East, the Educated, the Uneducated, Canada, the Baldwins, and even the French.  Sometimes you have to let go and enjoy, and this movie is worth the time.  The sound track alone (\\"Blame Canada\\", \\"Shut your...\\") makes the movie worth it.  A definite must for all South Park afficianados.  Then again, if you're an afficianado, you've probably seen it already.<br /><br />The movie was eerily prescient as well.  Bringing in Saddam Hussein, killing him, and making him the romantic partner of the devil - well, is it poor taste or 5 years ahead of it's time?  And predicting an American rush to war - even with Canada - well, was that was bold in 1999.<br /><br />Hard to close without commenting on the movie name.  I guess they snuck the penile humor by the censors.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|I have always been a Star Trek fan, but this film was worse than five {And that says a lot}. We don't need a special edition DVD. We need Paramount to go back, write an original script and end TNG with the type of class it deserves.<br /><br />The entire plot of Nemisis is borrowed from Star Trek II & III. And I am dead certain those who really loved this film probably never saw any of the two originals Nemisis lifts the majority of its plot from.  For those who have, this film will feel unoriginal and uninspired. And unlike Star Trek II, where we also lost a critical character, we feel almost no emotion as a main character dies in Nemisis.<br /><br />For those who said Insurrection was bad because it had less action than Nemisis or First Contact and was slow because it was confined mostly to one set: this movie suffers the opposite fate. At the very least Insurrection deeply rooted in what Roddenberry referred to as the \\"human conidtion\\" which had not existed in Sci-Fi prior to Star Trek's creation. There is no \\"human condition\\" here. The film is so stale you feel almost nothing for these characters on their \\"last\\" voyage together. That's an amazing acomplishment.<br /><br />Yes there are a lot of features left off the original Nemisis DVD. However, unless you buy this DVD for the extras it's not worth it {the original Nemisis already had enough extras anyway}. I give this movie two stars out of respect for the cast, out of respect for Gene Roddenberry and out of respect for Star Trek fans who will think it slander to say anything negative about Star Trek. But Paramount could have done better, especially when bringing an era to an end and they know it.
B00005JMAH|1.0|The director took a chainsaw to the Prisoner of Azkaban novel, and in the style of Leatherface, hacked it up to nothing.<br /><br />This movie fled so far off the path of the book it was frightening.  There were many non-canon moments, and many moments that could have been cut in favor of some more important deleted scenes.  The Knight Bus, while funny, was very different from the usual, and the  Marauders were practically non-existent.<br /><br />If I had only seen the movie and not read the book, then I would've come out confused:<br /><br />Who are the Marauders?  Maybe that'll be answered in a later movie...<br /><br />But the question is answered in book 3, so why not in movie 3?<br /><br />I did not like the Patronus, as this idea of rolling waves of light is not going to work, especially in the future movie adaptions (DA in movie 5, anyone?).<br /><br />There were some non-canon moments that, again, could have been cut in favor of some of the more important canon deleted scenes.<br /><br />The scene where Harry finds out about Sirius being his Godfather... the book did this about a million times better.  And Dan:  You are a good actor, but you need to learn how to fake cry.  You suck at it.  That whole scene was cheesey and badly invisioned.<br /><br />So, why does this movie earn one star?  As a movie alone, it was the best.  So it would, actually, have five stars if HP was not a book series.  It loses 4 of those 5 stars for being the worst movie compared to the books.

B0009UC810|5.0|Classic Movie.    Two brothers/musicians put their band back together to raise money to safe the orphanage they grew up in.  Add a lot of music, car chases and swearing, and you can probably fill the details in your mind.    Classic Music.    In interviews, the creators highlight the music they wanted to introduce to the world.  Some of the musicians were already popular - Ray Charles and James Brown needed no introduction.  Some had their careers reinvigorated as a result of the movie - at the time John Lee Hooker was so forgotten they didn't add him to the soundtrack.  The movie introduced him to a new generation and restarted his career.    Classic Lines.  \\"We're on a mission from God\\"  \\"Oh, we got both kinds. We got country AND western.\\"  \\"We're putting the band back together\\"  \\"It's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark and we're wearing sunglasses.\\"    Need I say more?

But instead you don't, so you make unintelligent, ignorant statements like the one you made above. I'm not going to waste any more time on you, I've got more important constructive things to do like listen to the Pixies.

B000002UA0|3.0|Back in the 60's, when Pink Floyd were playing nothing like instrumental passages and lyrically deep songs a'la Dark Side Of The Moon or Wish You Were Here, they were just an experimental psychodelic pub band dominated by Syd Barrett, who was (and is) considered as Pink Floyd Forefather. I am not so sure about it, but i give the respect. However, going back to the topic. Barrett was a crazy acid boy, who liked to get some drugs and write songs about gnomes. What came out of it was Pink Floyd first album called Piper At The Gate Of Dawn. Syd wrote almost all of the songs, except Take Up The Stechtoscope and Walk, which was the first official Waters song.  <br /> Many Pink Floyd fans and fanatics consider it as a masterpiece, blindly devouring everything PF every released; Come on guys, take it seriously. Of course, there are some great classics here (Astronomy Domine, Matilda Mother) but some songs are just weird, chaotic, and what comes after it: unlistenable and just dull for a listener with an open mind. Many ideas here are just being wasted by unfocused continuation. See for example Interstellar Overdrive; While the opening riff is purely incredible, this song turns into senseless, chaotic improvisation. I aprecciate experimenation; but this is just unlistenable. I tried to get through this song so many times; I always skipped it after few minutes, I just could not stand it. Fortunately, there are quite many standouts here: Lucifer Sam, a psychodelic rocker about Syd's cat and charming Matilda Mother are definetly two best tracks next to Astronomy Domine and Bike. There are some other good songs at here, while not as charming as the four hits above, they still are on level. Take Up The Stethoschope And Walk is a fine Roger song, however sounding more like Barret composition, which makes it no-original. (however it's not bad). Some more standouts are The Gnome, with a simple, nice melody and goofy lyrics; Pow R.Toc H. is a good one as well, with haunting beat andsome improvisations to it. But this is all basicly for PF fan; a standard music fan will not enjoy it so much and propably won't understand this music. Personally I consider it more as an experimental debut than a serious album; and I think this is how it should be taken. The Follow-Up, Saucerful Of Secrets, is a true psychodelic masterpiece and it shows the boyz could do it even better without Barret than with him. <br /> <br />Not bad overall... but not my favourite, that's for sure. Check that out if You want to hear some experimation.
B00006SFBD|5.0|I've never really liked the label \\"progressive\\". Somehow it always conjured up images of pretentious, pompous music, filled with technical proficiency but devoid of any emotional impact. Opeth, however, always seem to condense all that is good about progressive metal into album-sized chunks of brilliance. <br /> <br />\\"Deliverance\\" is Opeth's sixth album (or \\"observation\\", as they prefer to call it) and easily their heaviest and bleakest yet. But instead of overwhelming the listener with sheer complexity and all sorts of technical wankery as some progressive bands are wont to do, Opeth understand the idea of subtlety. The best way to describe Opeth's sound would be \\"musical chiaroscura\\", i.e. the contrast between the light and the dark. One particular musical passage might be full-on death metal, with roaring guitars and singer Mikael kerfeldt's menacing growl, but another might a soft acoustic passage, with kerfeldt's beautiful \\"clean\\" vocals. One can even see this light/dark dichotomy in Deliverance's companion album Damnation, which is devoid of anything \\"metal-ish\\", as well as the album and insert art for both Deliverance and Damnation, which consist of black and white photos. Despite the rather disparate elements present, kerfeldt and co. manage to pull it off without ever sounding discordant. <br /> <br />Of course, Opeth have never been the easiest band to get into, and those unfamiliar with the band might, upon their first listen, think \\"what's all the fuss about?\\" Opeth's songs are completely devoid of the typical \\"verse-chorus-verse\\" pattern that most music today sticks to, rather, their songs are structured in a manner similar to classical music, with each song divided into separate \\"passages\\" or \\"movements\\". I am not exaggerating in saying that one 12 minute Opeth song probably has enough material for some throwaway mainstream rock act to construct an entire album out of. <br /> <br />Musically, every one of the bands formidable talents are one display. kerfeldt proves he is one of metal's best vocalists and songwriters, with beautifully poetic (and sometimes downright creepy) lyrics. Guitarists Peter Lindgren and Martin Mendez lay down crushing riff after riff with astonishing creativity, and drummer Martin Lopez pounds away with machine-like precision, most noticeable one the finale of \\"Deliverance\\". But at no point do they ever become self-indulgent and riddle their songs with pointless, Dream Theater-esque showmanship. Finally, Steve Wilson's production is spot-on and sounds razor sharp, exactly as it should. <br /> <br />For the entire album, Opeth lays down great track after track. Opener \\"Wreath\\" launches immediately into a storm of crushing guitar riffs, going through several equally heavy passsages during it's 11-minute length. The follow-up track \\"Deliverance\\" continues where the previous track left off, mixing heavy and soft passages as only Opeth can do. The album only slows down for sorrowful, ballad-esque \\"A Fair Judgement\\" and the acoustic instrumental \\"For Absent Friends\\", before becoming brutally heavy again for \\"Master's Apprentices\\", with furious drumming and roaring guitar riffs, which segues into \\"By the Pain I See in Others\\" which is one of Opeth's most experimental songs, with unusual structures and time changes throughout. (Be sure to keep listening even when you think it's done!) As a whole, the album is one of those rare types where there are literally no weak tracks throughout. You can listen to whole thing through and the minutes will just fly by. It's that good. <br /> <br />This album is highly recommended, and a great start for anyone new to the band. Be sure to take a listen to the companion album \\"Damnation\\" as well to see the variety of styles Opeth can conquer. A fantastic band.
1577314808|5.0|I learned about this book from the movie:  What the Bleep Do We Know and related website, whatthebleep.com.  This book offers true insight into gaining an acceptance of the Power of Now instead of living with past pain and the craziness of a mind projected future.  I disagree with previous reviewers who felt that this book is New Age \\"mumbo jumbo\\" and repetitious.  You cannot dispute Tolle's premise that all we really have is this moment - NOW.  The past is gone and none of us has a guaranteed hold on the future. This book offers true peace and freedom for those who want to stop inflicting pain on themselves and others.

B00008PX8P|2.0|There is some good stuff here, particulairly the earlier performances. But Jimmy tends to solo too much and too long. And Robert Plant postures too much without any sense of humour. And we do not need 4 different versions of Dazed and Confused. The one great thing about this dvd is that we really see how great a musician John Paul Jones is. Brilliantly playing a variety of instruments while always staying cool. But after witnessing the plodding Knebworth performances, I thankfully remembered that The Clash had by that time already saved the true spirit of rock and roll. If you buy this dvd, you may only end up watching the first three minutes of each song.

B0000AZKPC|5.0|Ah, good ol' Sonata Arctica. My current favorite Finnish metal group took four years to release their debut album here, but when it first came, I'm sure fans of Silence and Winterheart's alike were flocking into the stores just to see what they sounded like in their developmental stages. Well, early on, they sounded a LOT like Stratovarius, only with a MUCH better vocalist. They have a lot of speedy songs on here, but the are easy to tell apart, including their first single, \\"UnOpened,\\" the brutal opener, \\"Blank File,\\" and the awesome third track, \\"8th Commandment.\\" However, they do have a typical Sonata ballad (\\"Letter to Dana\\"), as well as \\"My Land\\" and \\"Replica,\\" both of which begin like a ballad and grow increasingly heavy, only to mellow out by the end. Closer \\"Destruction Preventer\\" instantly made me think of the classic Stratovarius tune \\"Black Diamond,\\" as did the harpsichord intro from \\"UnOpened.\\" However, even though endless comparisons could be made to the BIGGEST power metal group from Finland, it didn't mean that they weren't their own band. And that's good, and also what helped this debut kick ass.
B00005JKG7|4.0|The fog finally comes to dvd and it's loaded with lots of special features. I was surprised of the good extras this dvd had. The film is one of the best horror film's ever, I liked it better then Halloween. The story is simple ghost come back for bloody revenge on the 100 aniversary of the town Antonio Bay. The acting was great also Adrienne Barbeau dose a great job of Stevie Wayne, Jamelie Curtis in a small inosent role and screen legend Janet Lee. The film is a great ghost story and the score of the film is suspensfull and adds chills.

Ok, before you start dissing me, here's some stuff I DON'T like about slipknot, to lighten the current load of hate you \\"poser\\" haters have on me.<br /><br />-The \\"sampler\\", Mick, basically doesn't have much influence on the band at all. You almost never hear him clearly, and on the tracks where you DO hear him clearly, those pieces can easily be also done by the DJ. I mean, think.<br /><br />Slipknot - Mick + (DJ doing Mick's parts as well as his own) = a better slipknot + a better looking DJ<br /><br />-The bassist is nearly inaudible in every track, about 1.5 times as inaudible as KoRn's bassist, and that's saying a LOT. Crank up your amp, bassist!!!<br /><br />Okay, that's basically all I hate about slipknot.<br /><br />Now for the things I particularly like about slipknot.<br /><br />-The lead guitar's sound. It's excellent.<br /><br />-Joey Jorridson, influentially the best drummer in nu-metal.<br /><br />Okay, and that's what I particularly like about Slipknot. My opinion about Cory's vocals? They're pretty good, but definitely not the best vocals ever.<br /><br />Now for you idiots who gave slipknot 0 stars for no reason.<br /><br />#1: Forget the masks as a way to diss them, alright? Yes, i think the masks are dumb too, but stop using them as 1/3rd of the reasons that you hate them in your reviews.<br /><br />#2: So there are 3 drummers/percussionists. So what. SO FU*KIN' WHAT. I mean, if you start a band that needs miscellanious percussion, you need more drummers. The end. Take that and shove it up your hole.<br /><br />______________________________<br /><br />The album itself, in my opinion, is a masterpiece, excellent form start to end.<br /><br />I'm a teen, so I'm too lazy to write anything else.
0380789027|5.0|And this collection of his short stories just proves it once again. This is a fabulous addition to anyone Neil Gaiman collection, or even just to your general fiction/myths collection.  <br /> <br />Neil has gathered in this book many wonderful and thought-provoking original stories, as well as some delightfully refreshing revamps of classic fairy tales.  <br /> <br />The book over-all does have a bit of a dark side, but for me that is refreshing from all the short story collections I've seen that are all happy and bright. Neil's masterful stories really got me hooked. I finished the whole book in a night and then immediately went back and reread it... several times.  <br /> <br />This is a book that will get worn out very quickly.

B0000507QH|5.0|After having seen this film my belief that french cinema of the last ten years is a s alive as ever has again been reassured. Many claims have been made, that french films aren`t what they used to be(which they of course aren`t, as time changes), even that the quality of french film production has fallen into mediocrity. But as Jonathan Rosenbaum pointed out already during the 90s in his essay on \\"Les Voleurs\\" (1996 / Andre Techine), a film I thoroughly recommend, is that most critics only consider what they get to see from french films, whixh is very little. If they were really interested and would dig a bit deeper into every years production on their own, they would find many rough diamonds along with some polished ones.  <br />Cedric Kahn is a young director and according to this film a most promising one. We have the Story of a middle-aged philosophy teacher who falls for a 17 year old girl (sorry Trevor ), but this isn`t your usual older man falls for Lolita type of film. In fact I got so bored after about 15 minutes, because of the lurid but seemingly empty pace of the movie and the contrived dialogue, that I started switching channels on my TV, but when i returned to the same scene I had left a few seconds later, i knew I was finally onto something.  <br />The film begins with a rapid pace showing a disturbed Charles Berling (who had one year earlier starred in Anne Fontaine's brilliant social study \\"Nettoyage a sec\\", but may be best known for the leading role in Patrice Leconte? \\"Ridicule\\") who has entered a cocktail party of his ex-wife Sophie, with the intention to speak to her (they seem to be separated for a short time only), but doesn't succeed as she seems to be more concerned with making the impression that she has her life under control, though we see that she's very far away from this goal. It is never explicitely mentioned in the film, but there are numerous great scenes that indicate that the marriage has left deep wounds in Sophie's heart and mind, and probably also in Berling's character, though he isn`t one for analizing situations, when it comes to himself. At the party he is \\"offered\\" a young student who admires him for the night, but she shows not a hint of interest. He even explains to Sophie, that he hasn't had sex for the last six months, and intends to go on this way, in order to write a new book. After having left, he wonders aimlessly through the night when he encounters a painter who gives him his adress after a rescue by Berling from a difficult situation. When he visits the painters house the next day, he discovers that he has died during sexual intercourse with his 17 year old student he was obsessed with. After meeting her, Berling steps in the same \\"trap\\". he starts a sexual relationship with her, that gets more and more dramatic until end of the film, and the final climax.  <br />The theme of the film is obssession, and it reminded me at times of Zulawski's movie of the same name, though it isn`t as notorious or deliric. A case study of the protagonists neuroses getting the best of him, and his entanglement into an illusion of his own making. The fascinating object of desire is Cecilia (debut by Sophie Guillemin), who in no way corresponds with a young femme fatale. Quite on the contrary. She is a bit fat, small, is aware of her sexuality but doesn`t use it as a tool, she is rather introverted and makes no real attempt at seducing anybody. More than anything else she is like an object waiting to be used, though only if it pleases her (which it seems to do quite often though). And that becomes the crucial point. No active relationship develops between the two besides a sexual one, which is neither demanding nor boring. Just plain ordinary sex, which is shown several times, and is over fast. Cecilia seems to be oblivious to ambition, the need to small-talk with people, or communicate on any other level than sexually. She seems to have no real needs nor desires, living in the moment, and witha day to day time-table, that`s pretty schematic. The protagonist now starts to interpret this blank canvas, and instead of writing his book, he begins to wonder what`s going on in Cecilia`s mind, begins projecting his own fears on her. He thinks she is cheating, she`s lying, she doesn`t love him, etc. as he becomes more and more possessive. As his desparate attempts to possess her even sexually don`t find a satisfiying conclusion his paranoia takes on a clinical state. More and more he turns into a victim to his desire for love and closeness, which he can`t possibly find in Cecilia, but instead of letting it go, he degrades himself even more.  <br />The strength of the film lies in its director`s ability to carry things to the extreme, to let its protagonist go not just to the borders, but clearly over everything socially acceptible. He shows the utter ridiculousness of the protagonists behaviour, without ridiculing him, and even in the most degrading and unbelievable scenes the direction never falters on what is a very small line between seriousness and absurdity, maintaining the films credibility, and most of all its sincerity, through which every character of the film is primarily his own, keeping its dignity. This exceptional accomplishment by Cdric Kahn is most promising for a young director more interested in the process of self-discovery and redemption of his characters, than in any bleak nihilism or apocalyptic vision of mankind and relationships.. The ending beautifully underscores his humanist standpoint.  <br />Strongly recommended.  <br />
B00005K3NR|5.0|I love this movie, and I got it within a few days of ordering it. It was brand new, awesome special edition version.
B000002UAX|5.0|Let's get one thing straight from the start. The Beatles' epnoymous album has its faults. It's highly self-indulgent, too long and has far too many weak tracks, which vary widely in terms of mood, style, pace etc. This gives the listener a very fractured, disjointed listening experience, but surely one which reflect the mood in the Beatles camp at the time. Let's not forget that, at this time: <br /> <br />- The Beatles had fallen out over their experiences with the Maraharishi; <br /> <br />- Yoko had pretty much installed herself a permanent fixture, and was ever present during recordings, causing massive rifts between the band members; <br /> <br />- Lennon was going through his divorce; <br /> <br />- McCartney had just been dumped by his fiancee; <br /> <br />- George was feeling increasingly annoyed at being shouted down by McCartney and Lennon (despite this album showcasing his best work); <br /> <br />- The Vietnam War was a huge issue, and this was treated differently by each member of the group. <br /> <br />Basically, The Beatles had drawn a line under the 'pop group' image, by abandoning touring and recording the psychedelic masterpiece that is Sgt Peppers. They were now individuals. No longer did they wear the same clothes and sport the same haircuts, but they all looked different and had their own very different agendas. <br /> <br />Nearly half of the album was recorded by the individual Beatles, and this was one of the first Beatles records where George Martin actually split some of the production duties. There was also far less communal song-writing between Lennon and McCartney. It was also the first album to feature female vocals (Yoko on 'Bungalow Bill') and a guest performance (Clapton on 'While My Guitar...'). <br /> <br />While I don't think that this album is as strong as, say,  Revolver, it is the most fascinating of all the albums because of the circumstances surrounding it. <br /> <br />That's not to say that there aren't some great songs on it. 'Back In The USSR' is a superb 'take' on the Beach Boys sound, and 'Revolution' is a fantastic Lennon contribution, as is the obscure 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun'. Macca's 'Helter Skelter' is a mighty beast of a rock record, and Harrison's 'While My Guitar...' is achingly beautiful.  <br /> <br />There are many more fantastic songs - 'Cry Baby Cry', 'Glass Onion', 'Julia' - but there are also some fillers. Too many songs seem to be an individual's own personal crusade. 'Honey Pie' does not sit well and 'Revolution 9' - Lennon and Ono's avant garde tape loop experiment - continues to cause a stir. <br /> <br />But that is the great thing about this album. It is more controversial than any other Beatles album, and continues to make me reappraise the band every time I listen. <br /> <br />Yes, it's long. Yes, it could be a single album. But personally, I wouldn't have it any other way.
B000002B7M|5.0|After being fired/quit from Black Sabbath after the release of 'Never Say Die', Ozzy Osbourne's musical career was in question. Could he escape the shadow of his former bandmates, and make a name for himself as a solo artist? From the opening riff of \\"I Don't Know\\", the answer would be undoubtedly yes. With the help of legendary guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Bob Daisley, and drummer Lee Kerslake, Ozzy proved to the world that he didn't need Sabbath to be successful. From the classic \\"Crazy Train\\" to the controversial \\"Suicide Solution\\", every listener will find something to enjoy. If you've never heard this album, or have only heard \\"Crazy Train\\", what are you waiting for? This is an absolutely classic album that still holds up today. It's just a shame that the 2002 reissue had to be tampered with... <br /> <br />HIGHLY recommended.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I enjoy watching this great trilogy of my favorite story.  It really brings the book to life.  I appreciate the care that was taken to do honor to Tolkien's work.<br /><br />Rave reviews are boring and have nothing creative about them unless they have some suggestions for improvement.  There are no perfect movies, and it is not good enough to just sit there and clap if you are a reviewer.<br /><br />One suggestion I have about this movie in particular, the second of the series, is to work harder at realism in the battle scenes.  There was a powerful impression that the \\"good guys\\" killed enemies at will and were infinitely more skillful at war than the \\"bad guys\\", who were just basically paper dolls to knock down, no matter how ferocious the costume.<br /><br />Along with that, more than once there were battle scenes that looked very bleak for the heroes (Helm's Deep and the ambush by the wargs), and then all of a sudden the battle was over and the enemies were completely gone.  That's nice, but what happened to them all?  One moment the enemies are numerous and menacing, and the next moment they are utterly destroyed, whoosh, gone.<br /><br />I have to commend the movie for one seemingly minor detail that was done excellently.  As the enemies approached Helm's Deep, several times we watched the women and children react to the noise that was being made by the attackers.  That careful attention to detail made the scene more powerful, because we could picture ourselves affected by the coming menace.<br /><br />There were a few times when I had to wonder if the film script had deviated from the book.  I would have to go back and re-read the book to know for sure, because I haven't read it in a number of years.  I'd have to consider any such deviations to be negatives, because I revere the book.<br /><br />It's like changing the Ten Commandments to suit yourself, like saying to get rid of \\"Thou shalt not covet\\" and replace it with \\"Thou shalt not have an abortion\\", or changing \\"Thou shalt not have any idols\\" to \\"Thou shalt not commit homosexual acts\\".  I realize that there are a lot of people who would like to add commandments against abortion and homosexuality, but you don't mess with the words of the master.  That's how I feel about Tolkien.<br /><br />Was Theoden really \\"possessed by\\" Saruman?  Did Gandalf really perform an exorcism on Theoden, as he did in the movie?  Were Frodo and Sam really taken all the way to Osgiliath (or wherever that battle was) before being released by Faramir?  Notice how I use the word \\"really\\" as if Tolkien's book is a history, not a novel.  Did Frodo, while a captive of Faramir, really have a face to face confrontation with a flying Nazgul during which he almost put on the ring until Sam stopped him?<br /><br />I'll have to read the book again to make sure I have all the details right.  Don't mess with my Tolkien.bortion\\", or changing \\"Thou shalt not have any idols\\" to \\"Thou shalt not commit homosexual acts\\".

B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I have read other reviews on this site that state how mad people are about the reissue. Whats the big deal??? If you have the movie already dont buy the reissue just because of the  blue cover. If you don't have the original DVD then  get which ever issue you can find simple as that. I dont own the DVD so I will get which ever one I can get at my local best buy. The film is still great and thats all that matters.
B0000047GA|4.0|Emergency! will knock your head for a loop.  The sound is raw and more akin to a distorted punk record than a pristine GRP-like digital recording.  And the trio is equally raw.  And although the sounds are raw and perhaps unrefined-- the songs can actually get pretty complex (especially McLaughlin's \\"Spectrum\\"-- tricky head!). <br />BOTTOM LINE-- check out Tony Williams Lifetime's Emergency!  Yeah, there are some dodgy hippie vocals, but so what-- they meant it, and that was the time!  Sonically and musically, Larry Young, Tony, and John are totally going for it and rocking!!
B000063DGC|5.0|To judge Randy Rhoads by only his in-studio work, you would be putting extraordinary limitations on this legend. To truly appreciate the man's work, all one must do is sit down and pop \\"Tribute\\" into their CD player. Every track here puts its studio counterpart to shame, and dare I say I include the Sabbath tracks as part of that statement. Just by listening to this album, one can see the chemistry between Ozzy and Randy that any band could only strive for. It is utterly tragic that his life was cut so short. This is one of, if not the best live album ever made. <br /> <br />HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommended.
1400043662|5.0|This is my favorite book that I have read in several years. I truly stumbled on it by accident, as it was mentioned on a mailing list that I recieve, and was getting fantastic reviews. When I was at the library the next day, I saw the book in the \\"New Arrivals \\" section and took it home with me. Not long after I got home, I had fallen completely in love with the book, and shortly after finishing the book a few days later- I ordered a copy for my own library. <br /> <br />I am an avid reader, and \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" is much different than most books you'll find out there today. Murakami dances through the plot with a whimsical sense of mystery, and the book is a joy to read. The story follows two seperate plotlines, giving the most attention to a young runaway, Kafka, who follows his intuition to a town in Southern Japan. Kafka is charming, witty, and very intellegent. Throughout the story, he is wrestling with his own adolescence, and at the same time trying to figure out why strange things keep happening around him. <br /> <br />The second storyline in the novel is about an older and possibly autistic man named Nakata. He is a simple, but extraordinary man, and is without a doubt, the star of the book (and one of my all time favorite characters). Nakata is also following his intuition, and listening to the advice of various cats around the country, with whom he makes regular conversation. <br /> <br />The two storylines weave in and out, and play off of each other in a way that could only be done by a master storyteller. There are elements of the supernatural that eventually come into play, but the story never slips into silliness. Murakami's imagination is a fantastic place to play, and you'll love every minute that you spend there. And believe it or not, the very best parts of Kafka on the Shore, are the parts where Kafka is in the woods by himself, far apart from the rest of humanity. Something about the way that the author describes solitude, is just beautiful. <br /> <br />This the first book that I have read by the famed Japanese author, but it definately wont be the last. I cannot recommed this book enough.
B0002858YS|4.0|I usually listen to heavier stuff but The Killers have a unique sound that kinda makes you want to just get up and dance.  It is true that there are a few songs which I usually skip over (\\"Smile like you mean it\\" and \\"Believe me Natalie\\") but there are some real gems on this CD, such as \\"Somebody told me\\" and \\"Midnight Show.\\" <br /> <br />But my favorite has got to be \\"Jenny was a friend of mine.\\" <br /> <br />I really liked \\"Somebody Told Me\\" when I first heard it but wasn't too sure about \\"Mr. Brightside\\" (I like it now), the other mainstream song.  But as soon as I heard, \\"Jenny was a friend of mine\\", I knew I liked the Killers. <br /> <br />The really good songs are \\"Jenny was a Friend of mine\\", \\"Somebody told Me\\", \\"Somebody Told Me\\", \\"Andy, you're a star\\", \\"Change your Mind\\", and \\"Midnight Show.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Mr. Brightside\\", \\"All these things I've done\\", and \\"Everything I've done\\" are certainly worth listening to. <br /> <br />I usually skip over \\"Smile like you Mean it\\", \\"On Top\\" and \\"Believe me Natalie.\\" <br /> <br />So you do the math.  Is it worth the CD for that many good songs?  I think it is.  They do have some variety from upbeat (\\"Somebody told me\\") to slow and heavy (\\"Andy, You're a star\\") to almost gospal sounding (\\"All these Things I've done\\").  I think it's worth it.  They're a pretty good band no matter what you're music prefence is.
B00006IU73|5.0|Whiles shopping for the new Dredg CD this album popped up on Amazon-related items lists...and I checked out the reviews and bought it yesterday. Amazing guitars, Fresh/original melodies, great vocal  ranges, also song lyrics are really really good!<br /><br />Everything you could ask for...very fun but mature music. Also very very fresh sounds for a band that has  apparantly been making music since the days of Pink Floyd!!! This group has an amazing history...anyway I'm  about to get more Porcupine Tree!<br /><br />Olaf Johnson
0316666343|5.0|What a wonderful, heartbreaking book!  <br /> <br />The narrator of this book is a fresh, original voice.  She's not bitter about her murder; she seems to accept it for what it is.  She misses her life, of course, but she also feels a certain contentment with watching her family struggle through life's curveballs. Susie's Salmon's family seems like the typical American family, but they're all tested with Susie's death, and the result is each member trying to sink or swim with the grief which overwhelms them. <br /> <br />Alice Sebold presented a unique view in this murder story: the perspective of the killer as he goes about his life.  Susie Salmon doesn't seethe with hate for this man; rather, she seems to wish he'd just go away so that her family could get back to normal.   <br /> <br />Although each of the characters has obvious flaws, the readers finds him/herself rooting for all of them at one time or another.  We sympathize with Susie's mother, who tries desperately to survive her marriage and fails; we ache with Susie's father, who is THISCLOSE to nabbing Susie's killer; we cry with Susie's sister, who tries to shake off the stigma of being the \\"dead girl's sister\\"; we even sympathize for fleeting moments with Susie's killer, who obviously has issues of his own which have festered for years.  The character development is deep and lasting, and I found myself fully entrenched in their unique personalities. <br /> <br />Of course, death's curse finds its own glimmer of hope: everlasting love which transcends worlds.  The end of the book is quite beautiful.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I loved this movie. It moves at a slow pace, and there's lots of conversation, but it's all good, like an afternoon spent catching up with an old friend. Of course these old friends knew each other for just one day before they parted ten years before, but the viewer can see that the years have done nothing to tamp down the flames. It doesn't hurt that Before Sunset was filmed on location in Paris. The ending is wonderful. And I want her apartment!

1410102033|4.0|Hitler's ideas are too much for your feeble minds to comprehend. If you are bashing this book your probably Jewish or homosexual and won't even give it a chance. I would advise you to do so. Hitler was very philosophic and one major influence in Satanic culture today. This man had the power to dominate many countries and I respect him for that. I am not a racist, nor will I ever be, I just acknowledge the fact that Hitler almost conquered the world.
0679879269|5.0|I liked The Amber Spyglass better than the fist two books in this series and it has become one of my favourite books of all time. It's a fantastic book for those who are able to not get angry over someone else's thoughts about religion. Philip Pullman is able to write in such detail that you can feel the pains and joy but not to such an extent that the readers become bored.  <br />~GREAT BOOK~GREAT BOOK~GREAT BOOK~
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I am a huge Dream Theater fan but was disappointed with this one.  There was just nothing there.
0780628551|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie besides the fact that there was some unnecessary high sexual content, that was just riduculous looking by the way, and Johnny Depp's southern accent is a little off.  I'm a fan of his acting abilities so other than that, it was suspenseful and interesting with a good concept.  I wouldn't recommend showing it to anyone under 14 though.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Whenever I think than he has done his best to impress movie fans, he comes with something even better,and completely new. This time, Tim Burton is taking us to Wonderland, a chocolate factory. And, at the same time, facing us with our desireous sins. So,if you are thinking about taking your kids to the movie theatre to watch this film, don`t. This Wonderland is made for adults. And, don`t miss it! This is a masterpiece,but aren`t Burton`s all movies masterpieces?
0743454537|5.0|This was a great book - a tough subject and very emotional with a surprise ending.  I have a young family member that went through a lot of what one of the characters went through.  Very well written.  Highly recommended, but be ready to shed some tears.
B000AY807Q|5.0|When I picked this up tuesday I listened to it once, twice, again and again. This album has an ambiance that is amazing. All the tracks are tops. This is Neil taking stock of his times and his roots. \\"tick tock - the clock on the wall - no wonder were losing time\\" Greendale was an amazing record, but Prarie Wind is an all emcompassing statement of an artist who has the words but wisdom to keep it simple. Buy this record, it will be one of the Neil Young lp's that you keep coming back too. Honest, Reflective, Dark, Prarie Wind is his masterwork.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots (or Purple) (1994.), the Stone Temple Pilots' second studio album<br /><br />The early 90's were an explosive time for music. Alternative grunge rock had taken hold right at the start of the decade with bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Nirvana and Alice In Chains gaining widespread popularity. Plenty of other groups though were trying out the whole grunge trend. One of these bands was the Stone Temple Pilots. Originally coming on the scene in 1992 with their debut album 'Core', the 'Pilots were at first given the tag of being Pearl Jam rip-offs. However, with their debut the band showed they had the makings of becoming one of the great acts of the 90's. 'Stone Temple Pilots' (also known as 'Purple'), the Stone Temple Pilots second studio album, released in 1994 was the bands much awaited follow up to their successful first album. 'Purple' has in time grown to be the band's most popular album release. So, does 'Purple' really deserve the critical acclaim that it has been given.<br /><br />Let's make it simple; this album is a masterpiece. With this album, the Stone Temple Pilots totally found their sound. If their debut left some people writing the band off as rip-offs, 'Purple' completely smothers the idea. More than just a straight ahead hard rock, riff filled album, the Stone Temple Pilots reveal the more diverse side of their music, which is what in many ways gives the band their own identity and sets them apart from the pack. This album is alternative rock at its most refined. Breaking away from the 'grunge' mold (however you interpret that), this album is a mix of songs with powerful riffing (i.e. 'Meat Plow' or 'Silvergun Superman') and slower stuff (i.e. 'Big Empty'), plus not to forget the more diverse songs like the acoustically driven 'Pretty Penny'. On the whole, you can easily say that some of the band's best songs are on this album and you can tell this as the instrumentation and lyrics feel completely assured right through the album. Lead guitarist Dean DeLeo his brother bassist Robert DeLeo show how diverse guitar playing can be on this album, where we go from the harder more metal sounding riffs, to acoustic and country sounding moments. Scott Weiland's lyrics are at times crazy and other times powerful and cynical. However, the powerful vocal style the man has makes the words blend easily with the music. 'Purple' is quite simply one of those albums were all of the songs work without sounding out of place or inconsistent. 'Purple' is 11 years old but has that remarkably fresh appeal to it every time you listen to it.<br /><br />There is one thing though that really hacks me off about this album and the same goes for the album's follow up, 'Tiny Music'. You guessed it, its the back cover of the CD; there is no tracklisting. This is a mistake that you hope will be corrected in time because it always helps to be able to see whats on the album, especially when your viewing the CD over before buying it from a shop!<br /><br />So what about the 12 gracious melodies this album gives us. STP kick off their second album with 'Meat Plow', a heavy riffed opener. Weiland sings this one with a down and out style, a great opening song. 'Vasoline' fades in next, with some quirky guitar hooks and pronounced drumming. The chorus on this one is awesome where Weiland sings 'it isn't you, isn't me' to a great guitar riff. Next is 'Lounge Fly', a sonic sounding opening, with some more pounding riffs. Weiland's lyrics gives this song a pent up aggressive side. Things slow down next for 'Interstate Love Song', the guitar play is a perfect mix of hard riffs with a bit of a country sound. A great ballad styled song where Weiland sings about events past, and things/people you've left behind. 'Still Remains' keeps up the power driven riffs; again the band jam out a great chorus with some clever echoeing singing from Weiland. Eric Kretz drums out a great surprise entry towards the end of the track.<br /><br />'PrettyPenny' is one of the more diverse tracks on the album. Its got a great acoustic sound. Crazier lyrics follow with 'Silver Gun Superman'. You've gotta love the metal riffs to this one. For me though, 'Big Empty' is the greatest track on the album, Weiland yearns out the opening verse before the song builds into a great driving chorus, at its most powerful where Weiland screams 'conversations kill'. This song is a perfect mix of the bands melodic and experimental sides. The supercharged 'Unglued' follows, a 2 minute bashed out rocker that you NEVER get tired of playing again and again. 'Army Ants' starts suspiciously before building into another explosive song. However 'Kitchenware and Candybars' is a great change to finish the album. Again like a ballad, the song has a great orchestral addition at the end to accompany some luscious riffs and some emotive vocals. Keep this track running though for the twelfth song (its fixed onto track eleven), a funny song where Weiland sings about the 'second' album to the tune of trumpets and hammond organ!<br /><br />When people look back on the 90's era of music, yes they will think about the bands who set the trends like the Pearl Jam and others. However, im confident that the Stone Temple Pilots will also be remebered as one of the great alternative rock acts also, in no part due to this masterpiece of an album.

B00028HBKM|1.0|I am bigtime Mel Gibsons fan always. I love all Lethalwepon Film and Mad Max too. Braveheart is one of best movie in my opine. <br /> <br />These film, Passion of Christus, is not fun movie or interest. Is all blood and blood. Not a story. Also lenguage is strange.  <br /> <br />When Christus die he come again at ending- so all blood for why? And acting not special.  <br /> <br />So Mel please do Lethalwepon 4 or Braveheart or Patriot 2. Is better movie idea. And do in English!
B000006U44|5.0|My exploration into the crazy world of Kate Bush began in December 2004 when I bought \\"Hounds Of Love.\\" After quickly realising that it was one of the best albums I've ever heard, I set about buying more of her albums. However, I must have become distracted and it wasn't until August this year that I bought four of her albums in one go. One of these albums was her debut, 1978's \\"The Kick Inside.\\" To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this album because I always assumed Kate Bush would be the kind of artist who got better with age. While this is still true, her debut album is absolutely flawless. A ground-breaking, melodic and joyous set that sounded like nothing else at the time it was released.<br /><br />The album charted at No.3 when it was released and was a big hit for the then-19 year old pop star. The album was produced by David Gilmour, of Pink Floyd legend, who also discovered and financed Kate and got her a record deal after discovering her unique talent. Kate Bush had a relatively easy start to her phenomenal career, which inspired jealousy in many. However, the talent was there and despite your opinions on her, Kate Bush is one woman who cannot be ignored.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Moving.\\" A whale song opens this song gently, which is quite haunting and indeed moving. A piano then plays and Kate sweeps in with her soaring vocals. This song is very beautiful and features such gorgeous lyrics as \\"You crush the lilly in my soul.\\" The drums are awesome on this song, and build a real sense of atmosphere. \\"The Saxophone Song\\" opens with the whale song again, wailing through the deep ocean. This song is perhaps even stronger than the opener, and has a brilliant - if dated - saxophone solo in the chorus after Kate sings, \\"Tuning in on your saxophone.\\" The next song, \\"Strange Phenomena,\\" is one of my personal favourites. The piano intro is very eerie with Kate's vocals contrasting it perfectly. The switch between something more sinister to something soft and delicate is very appealing, the best part of the song being where Kate sings, \\"You pick up a paper, you read a name. You go out, it turns up again and again...\\"<br /><br />I didn't like \\"Kite\\" when I first heard it but since then I've gone on to absolutely adore it! This song is really incredible and soars just like a kite. Kate's vocals are totally loopy and all over the place to represent a kite in the sky, light and free. I love it when Kate sings, \\"Come up and be a kite!\\" as her voice soars. \\"The Man With The Child In His Eyes\\" is the album's biggest ballad and was a huge hit for Kate in England. This song was written and composed entirely by Kate back when she was just 17 years old. The lyrics are very mature, being from such a young mind. The song shifts moods beautiful and the chorus is like a soft light coming through a dark room. \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is, and always will be, Kate's biggest and most famous song. This is one of the best-selling songs of all time and is a unique, classy, operatic and timeless piece of unclassifiable music. Her cinematic and literary influences were most obvious in this song. The song wasn't initially inspired by Emily Bronte's novel, but by a film or tv adaptation (Kate has never specifically identified which version it was) of the book, although she did read the novel later to, in her own words, 'get the research right'.<br /><br />\\"James And The Cold Gun\\" is another great song but one of my least favourites on the album. The lyrics are a bit boring to me, but the music is quite interesting, especially the guitar. \\"Feel It\\" is a very sexual and passionate song in which Kate sings about making love to her lover. The male musicians on this song later admitted to being quite embarrassed during the recording of this song, which I find rather adorable because it was only 1978. \\"Oh To Be In Love\\" is another fantastic song, yet probably one of the strangest on the album. The verses are very light and airy with Kate's breathyvocals weaving in and out of the piano riff. The chorus, however, completely subverts this and brings in male vocals to deepen the sound. There is a bouncy quality to the vocals that is very appealing. \\"L'Amour Looks Something Like You\\" is rather short at two and a half minutes long, but it's still another great song. This is actually a very erotic song in which Kate flaunts her feminine sexuality, especially in the second verse. There is an uncorrupted innocence in her vocal delivery, though, because it's just so pure and unique.<br /><br />\\"Them Heavy People\\" is another one of my favourite songs on this album, because it's just too catchy to express in words! I love how Kate sings \\"Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me!\\" in such a crazy yet adorable way. The chorus is very bouncy and catchy, and the song plays out with Kate unforgettably crying, \\"Rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling!\\" It's so catchy! \\"Room For The Life\\" is a bit below par in comparison to most of the album, but it's still a great song. The album closes with the title track, \\"The Kick Inside.\\" This song is based on the ballad of Lizzie Wan, the story of a girl who kills herself after being made pregnant by her brother. It's quite a sad song and ends emotionally. Very poignant.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Kate Bush has inspired many, many artists over the past 30 years, including some of my own personal favourites, Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan inparticular. She is truly the original who inspired the rest, and it's a crying shame that she never made it big in America. This album is one of Kate's best and is a debut that stands alongside some of the all-time great albums. She has finally broken her 12-year long silence, with the release of \\"Aerial,\\" her first album since 1993's \\"The Red Shoes.\\" This new album is a two-disc set released on November 8th and will be absolutely huge in England because the hype is so big. I'm hoping Kate mania will sweep the nation over the next few months and cause a revival in her work, because she deserves nothing less. The woman is a genius, and this album is a testament to it.piano riff. The chorus, however, completely subverts this and brings in male vocals to deepen the sound.

B000A59PMO|5.0|At first I did'nt want to see it because they call it the next buffy and being a huge buffy fan I thought it was stupid and even offensive to compare this to buffy. So I didn't see it at first but then I had no choice since they weren't giving anything on tv so I decided to watch it and Im very glad I did.This show is fun as well as addictive.The first episode makes you get to know the characters very quickly and dramatically making you want to want to know more about them.The plots of the show are also fun and interesting to watch.To me this show doesn't even come close to buffy, But it's so damn good to watch and enjoy I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to everyone.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Being an old school sci-fi fan I loved this movie.It put me in the mind of FLASH GORDON(1980)that had the great QUEEN soundtrack but with 25 years of special effects improvements. Speaking of effects, what I really enjoy is the MAKING OF extras on DVD. I am teaching myself 3D computer animation and graphics with off-the-shelf software. I am able to see and use the techniques, tips, and tricks these professionals are using to get dazzling effects on a low budget, some of which you would never get in a college classroom and with only a digital camcorder and five year old computer. MY results have made my friends jaws drop in disbelief. When asked if I went to School for this I simply say I learned it from the movies!!
B000AADYRQ|3.0|The fact that DCFC have moved to a new commercial label shouldn't stop you from giving the album a listen. They deserve that much. It's a fresh, almost commendable effort, and despite what anyone else might say, the guitars still exist - along with xylophones, synths and the trademark Ben Gibbard jibberish of love and pain and well... painful love.  <br /> <br />But don't expect this album to miraculously move you in ways that so many people profess a DCFC album should. It's a good listen for a breezy summer day, one that you should take in with a swig of Vodka and some barbecued chicken and thereafter kept in storage after three or four listens only to be whisked out again for 5cents at a garage sale next year.  <br /> <br />I particularly liked 'Your Heart Is An Empty Room' because on a day that I had a migraine, it put me straight to blissful sleep.
0451196716|5.0|If you ask me, The Long Walk may well be the most fascinating novel Stephen King has ever written.  Written back in 1966-67, while King was a college freshman, the novel earned the author nothing more than a form rejection letter.  Finally, after a few years of dust-gathering, the manuscript was released into a much more welcoming world in the form of Richard Bachman's second novel.  It's a magnificent story - not perfect, but magnificent nonetheless.  It's a disarmingly simple tale centered on a seemingly mundane activity, yet in King's masterful hands The Long Walk burrows into the core of a number of characters, lays down miles of metaphors about the human condition, and absolutely mesmerizes you with its emotional force and power.<br /><br />The setting is an alternate, possible fascist America; King leaves things pretty murky on the sociopolitical end of things, almost surely by design.  The Long Walk is really one of your \\"it can't happen in America\\" kind of stories, and the horror of it all (and, yes, I would categorize this as a horror novel) is made more powerful by obscuring the lines between our America and this fictionalized America.  Here, The Long Walk is the premier sporting event in the land.  Spectators turn out in droves, bets are made left and right, and the whole nation watches and cheers.  Obviously, this is not a regular walk, nor is it a race in the purist sense.  Endurance - mental even more than physical - is the key to victory in this sport.  To win, all you have to do is outlast 99 other competitors - and the winner receives nothing less than whatever he wants for the rest of his life.  Before you yell \\"Sign me up,\\" you'll want to hear about the details.  You have to maintain a pace of at least four miles per hour; fall below the pace, and you get a warning.  You are allowed three warnings (and you can \\"lose\\" a warning by walking another hour on the pace), and then you get ticketed.  Getting ticketed doesn't get you a place to rest or even a little much-needed nourishment; all it gets you is one or more bullets in the head.<br /><br />The obvious question is: why would anyone volunteer for this, knowing that he was almost surely going to die?  That's a large part of what this whole novel is about.  The contestants do a lot of talking while they're walking; most of them dance around the \\"why\\" issue, but we see clues to some of the reasons as each lad draws closer and closer to death.  For some, reality doesn't really set in until the guns started blazing.  Cockiness turns to anger, fear, shock, and just about every other kind of dark emotion you can imagine.  The boys are stripped bare in both body and mind as the Walk goes on and on, through all kinds of weather.  Through his characters, King is basically asking the reader how he/she will face death when it comes.  Will you freeze up early on?  How long will you fight to stay alive after you've pushed your body far beyond the breaking point?  Will you lie down and accept your fate, or will you lose control and lash out at your perceived enemies?<br /><br />The most weighty questions actually involve the crowd.  As the Walk progresses, more and more people come out to cheer the Watchers on, secretly hoping to see someone get ticketed before there very eyes.  This goes far beyond craning your neck to see everything you can at an accident scene.  For the Walkers, the crowd eventually becomes Crowd, an amorphous creature always right there roaring and grabbing at them, living (and dying) vicariously through them.  Obviously, one thing the Long Walk represents is life itself.  The Walkers literally age before our eyes as exhausting hours turn into ever darker, more painful days.  Death's approach changes every one of them.  Fate has its way with each one's odds of winning, allowing for no favorites among them, as even those with the most going for them sometimes find themselves felled by injuries and sickness.  During the journey, the Walkers arrange themselves into little groups, develop enemies, and help - or don't help - one another keep going.  Is life a competition or a journey?  Different things motivate them to keep going - family, a girl back home, or - for some - just the satisfaction of outlasting another Walker they don't like (oddly enough, the Prize never really seems to mean much to any of them).<br /><br />I could just go on and on with the symbolism of this story.  I haven't even described the characters, and I think it is better if I don't - except to say that the story is told from the perspective of \\"Maine's own\\" Walker, Ray Garraty.  I could read this novel over and over again without ever growing tired of it.  It's just endlessly fascinating and illuminating.  Even as a very young writer, King had a lot to say, he understood people, and - most of all - he knew how to tell a story better than just about everyone else who has ever lived.arrange themselves into little groups, develop enemies, and help - or don't help - one another keep going.

B00008H2LB|2.0|First off, I just want to say that taste in metal is soley a matter of personal choice.  No matter what band you listen to, someone is going to love it and someone is going to hate it.  And since people naturally have to make their opinions known, we have these wonderful debates as though they were a matter of life and death.  With that in mind, I would like to throw down my belated opinion of Meteoria, and Linkin Park in general, not with the intention of trashing anyones taste but in pointing out some simple facts. <br /> <br />1.  Linkin Park is a passing fad.  They do not have staying power, because they have no room to evolve.  If they hang around for a fourth album, Ill be suprised.  Given the amount of improvement between Hybrid Theory and Meteoria, which is to say none whatsoever, its hard to imagine that they will be making any strides that will buy them new fans, and since they are losing the fickle fans they already had, that leads to one conclusion. <br /> <br />2.  So tell me, what is the difference between nu-metal and true metal?  Talent.  Passion.  Less money.  Take your pick.  Linkin Park is a formula that works as follows:  Set up basic drum beat, identical bassline, marginal guitarwork, a DJ that appeals to the exact opposite crowd of what your considered to be, and add one singer that sounds like his balls are locked in a vice and screams like an adolescent, and finally throw in the rapper to improve your chances with MTV.  There you have it, commercial success.  Plus when your fan base consists of nothing but teenagers, you better have a backup plan.  Linkin Park does not. <br /> <br />3.  Now onto the CD, which I will be brief about since you have already heard it a thousand times on radio.  Sit down and listen to Hybrid Theory, which will take about 30 minutes, then listen to Meteoria, another 30 minute investment.  Can you honestly tell a difference between them?  Cause I couldnt, song by song the formula is identical.  Hybrid Theory was original in some sense, though not by much, but the nature of the music is that it can only survive as long as the fad does.  And the end is near my friends.  So taken on its own, Meteoria is a testement to a simple fact, and that is this:  Though appealing in the short run, Linkin Park will ultimately fall into the shadows of music history.  And this shadow will be cast by bands such as Iron Maiden, Megadeth, and other metal gods that have left a lasting impression.  One day the youth will grow up and recognize this fact, till then enjoy your fads.
B000AY807Q|5.0|Its been a while since a new album has caused as many immediate repeated listenings for me as Prairie Wind. I guess its inevitable to compare this recording with Neil Young's very best songs and albums because it stands up well in that context. Many songs have touching, reflective lyrics, and maybe a philosophical maturity that is beyond anything he has written before. Several songs are standouts, and the melody that I find running through my mind later seems to vary among those. \\"Its a Dream\\" is so touching and absolutely beautiful; I think anyone who has experienced significant personal loss will be moved by such an accepting interpetation of our own mortality.    I'm delighted with the accompanying dvd in this package. What a great concept, being able to see the entire album being recorded exactly as you hear it on the cd. It causes me to ponder 'what if' scenerios of similar documentation of any of my all-time-favorite recordings. The upgrade to this duo-disk set is well worth the few dollars more.
0201633612|3.0|It's hard to imagine how a software developer in 2005 could function without ready access to this 1995 classic. Without this book how could anyone  * Explain why the Factory Method pattern (page 107) is a special case of the Template Method (page 325) or why it isn't.  * Prove that Java's DriverManager.getConnection(...) method illustrates the Abstract Factory Method design pattern (page 87) rather than the Factory design pattern.  * Think of any practical example of the Visitor pattern (page 331).  * Agree on whether or not a given piece of software actually illustrates a specific one of the 23 patterns identified in this book.    Like the Guinness Book of World Records settles arguments between drinkers this book is the final authoritative arbiter when software developers argue about design patterns. This book is also useful for learning how to use design patterns to design and write better code.    It is a testament to the importance of this book that in the ten years since it was published the design patterns community has not really agreed on any additional patterns beyond the 23 defined here--although many more have certainly been proposed. Even more significantly, few have had the courage to suggest that some of the 23 patterns defined here might be of little practical value. Most design pattern book authors since treat these exact same patterns. I suspect their publishers insist on it because that's what the buying public seems to want. As a result it is certainly fair to say that once you buy this book you don't really need to buy any more books on the subject.    In fact, one might argue that this book is one of the few design patterns book you can buy that is 100% focused on helping developers write better code. Other books that dare to introduce valuable new ideas on design patterns typically include an explicit acknowledgement that the ideas that can't be traced back to the Gang of Four. Any time spent defining yourself in terms of the Gang of Four is time that is not being spent advancing the field itself or helping developers.    Another indication of the importance of this book is that fact that other design pattern authors often quote it directly, particularly the short definitions of the design patterns. This might suggest that other authors find it difficult to understand some of the 23 patterns well enough to be able to clearly and confidently explain them in their own words. Whatever the actual reason, it certainly indicates that if you want to buy a book on design patterns, this is the book to buy.    I wish the authors of this book would publish an official statement giving their disciples explicit permission to move forward with design patterns, improving and adapting them, adding new ones and letting those that haven't stood the test of time gracefully fade away. As it is, the study of design patterns is in danger of becoming a study of this book rather than a study of how to actually write better code using patterns.    I'll close with a significant and apparently overlooked line from the preface of this book:    \\"We don't consider this collection of design patterns complete and static; it's more a recording of our current thoughts on design.\\"
B00005JO0J|5.0|Serenity is a great film.  It's fun, it's fast-paced, it has memorable dialogue (\\"I don't want to explode!\\").  It balances drama and fast-paced action with dialogue that had the audience bursting out with laughter when I saw it last night in the theater. <br /> <br />Serenity is, for all intents and purposes, Firefly's last episode + the passage of a few months' time off-screen.  Firefly was a short-lived series on the Fox channel.  It lasted all of eleven or so episodes and the Fox exec's did what they usually did: they saw it was quality television with brilliant dialogue, an amazing ensemble of talented actors, character development, and -- worst of all -- a story arc that actually was going somewhere ... and they killed it.  Serenity is the product of fan loyalty and a tireless director's efforts and -- most importantly -- millions of the series DVD's flying of the shelves.  It's the child of people loaning their Firefly DVD\\"s to their friends and their friends watching four episodes, returning the set, and then going out to buy their own DVD set, because it was an amazing series.  The movie is every bit as good, which is pretty damned gratifying. <br /> <br />It's been written so that it isn't at all necessary to have seen the short-lived series to 'get' the film.  Seeing the film, however, will leave you wanting to get the series on DVD.  Serenity is everything the fans loved about the series: atmosphere, character, story development.  And Whedon, as always, is merciless.  Hollywood franchises typically build and preserve their assets: characters are eternal, there is no real story development, episode 48 is for all intents and purposes the same as episode 2.  Whedon is exactly the opposite : if a character millions of fans love needs to die in a scene, Whedon kills him, her, it, their pet goldfish and drops a ship on them just to make it absolutely clear that they are dead, gone, finis, pushing up daisies in that grand daisy-pushing place where Firefly characters go when they die.  Whedon tells stories.  It's part of what makes this an amazing two-hour, multi-million dollar, seat-of-your-pants, \\"that was amazing!\\" event.  This movies goes places and when it's done you're a: satisfied, and b: you make plans to take your friends to it and c: you want to see a Big Damn Trilogy. <br /> <br />I won't give away anything in the film, but I recommend this film.  This is a great story.  You don't see a lot of that these days.  You will enjoy the hell out of yourselves.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|I came to rewrite this album on the conditiong that you understand that I have a bad habit of misunderstanding and mishearing the concept of albums on the first listen. The one I gave on Demon Days was kind of uneven and not up to par. I also have a condition where everytime I listen to Sigur Ros' entire albums, my chest starts to feel empty. I tested it on Thanksgiving when I listened to ( ), and my chest felt empty even with a little turkey and a little juice in it. But here is my will to try again.  <br /> So on this one the best I can tell you is that the album sounds good, but it isn't for everyone. As you see I love Sigur Ros and was eager to listen to the album, and because the words were in an international dialect (Hopelandic, Icelandic, Gigantic?) the only thing I can actually describe is the music and nothing more, which dsidn't even help me when I start listening to it. All I know is that this album is beautiful but sounds like your entire day structure.  <br /> \\"takk...\\" is the sunset that shines on your entire day while \\"heysatan\\" is the sunset in which when you listen to it, you start to be disappointred that a day like this has ended so shortly and unexpectedly. Now I can actually see what makes \\"Glosoli\\" a good song. This is a song that to me signals that your day of discovery just got started. (How? \\"takk...\\" can be known as the original introduction to \\"Glosoli\\".) It is about a boy who is trying to walk aroung looking for the sun. The walking beat, which I mistook for soldier marches, was supposed to be snow and as the song gets louder is him having to go throw the craziest of moments before actually catching the sun in action. The thing is the music is just as wonderful and beautiful to the mind and the ears in coordination as the innovative allegedly-for-something-but-for-nothing ( ). Whenever you listen to songs like \\"Hoppipola\\" and \\"Milano\\", your eyes are likely to just light up and you are likely to picture utopia as much as you did when youlistened to Agaetis Byrjun, which I have the strongest urge to compare the effects of the beginning songs to. Also, just like that album, each song just flows into each other making a storybook out of their music, which further explains why the CD cover looks like the cover of a storybook. <br /> The come-together of falsettos and classical arrangements in this album is likely to steal your heart and splatter it all over this disc if you aren't careful, which is why I worry about the same whereabouts everytime Apple Martin takes a listen. <br /> <br />Rating: 8.5/10
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Its hard to say this is a remake, for Tim Burton has twisted this story into a mind of its own. Johnny Depp is superb as the rather odd chocolate inventor, who's childhood was less then perfect and adult life surrounded by an atmosphere children can only dream of.<br /><br />Yes I say childhood, for Burton has given us a look behind the story of Wonka, his father being a dentist who on one halloween threw all of Willy's precious, gathered candy into a fire. Being afraid of the cavities and other trouble sweets bring. Sound dumb? Not at all. Wonka has in consiquence grown up with a twisted idea of how families are, and has a hard time being around parents, even saying the word is torturous for the candy man.<br /><br />Other than that, this remake has run even closer to the book, Veronica being thrown down the garabge shoot by the squarrels instead of trying to get the goose that laid chocolate eggs. Even the Oompa Loompas have undergone changes, and in turn are hipper, wilder and smaller then before.<br /><br />The landscape is very Tim Burtonesque, in the beginning of the movie, its not hard to guess who's the director (If you already didn't know) For the coloring is dark, and the Buckets house has a decided scrunched look, and tilts to the right in a way only Tim Burton could make it tilt without completely falling.<br /><br />I can't quite say though its a movie to take you're children to. With Willy Wonka licking Bug blood of his Machete, to an Oompa Loompa trying to stab Mike Tv, to dolls catching on fire and dying horrible plastic melting deaths. Other than that, apart from the adult moments and understanding of the film, children might enjoy it.
0307276902|3.0|Yesterday I finished this book and it couldn't be soon enough. It was so hard to read. I mean- I don't want to give it away- and I think that the story is a powerful one of willpower and addiction. But to me, that story gets very lost in the format. The book is highly dialog. Yet there is no puncuation to set apart the different characters.  In this book, unfortunately, I found that the author's liberties with style severely detracted from the actual story the book was trying to tell. It made the book terribly hard for me to finish because as I returned to the book after setting it down- I would have to re-read several pages to remember who was talking and what was being talked about. I felt that the style drowned out the different voices of the characters. It saddened me because I felt it made the book a chore to read- and I feel that it may turn readers off.<br /><br />That being said...some of the characters in this book really shone through for me. Specifically Leonard and Miles. I felt that despite the disruptive style of prose- these characters were vividedly painted and true characters.  And I feel that underneth trying to figure out who was speaking - there is a powerful story of the almost constant stuggle over addictions.  Overall though I was disappointed with this book.  I am giving it three stars for the story and characters- it would have been higher if it hadn't been for the hard-to-read format of the story.

B000002LEU|4.0|I only have listen to this cd like 3 times since i bought it a year ago but it is still a very good cd. I guess i like joy divison but cant listen to there cds all the time. I also have listen to closer which is good but very depressing. The best songs on here are Atmosphere and Love will tear us apart. But every song on this cd is decent and not one i skip when listening to it. This music was done in the late 70s and it still sounds fresh today. Bands like interpol and such would give there left nut to make music this good.
B000654Z2I|4.0|1.Paperhouse***** - is a kick-ass tune, never heard anything like it. <br />2.Mushroom**** - is a great tune to follow Paperhouse <br />3.Oh Yeah**** - is has a great beat, no matter what Damo's singing <br />4.Halleluhwah***** - is unbelieveable it was recorded in 1971 , way ahead of it's time. <br />5.,6.,7.* I don't even remember the names of the last 3 songs, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars, but even though I recommend you buy this CD, Just to hear Paperhouse though Halleluhwah, WARNING: You must have an open mind and give it a chance.
B000002G87|5.0|If you only want one Eric Clapton record in your collection, make it this one. Recorded at his zenith, a joy forever. My reason for purchase! The vinyl copy has been worn out. Never tire of listening to the whole album. Well worth your hard earned money.
B000024D4R|5.0|For all you rappers, country punks, and modern rockers, Pink Floyd's Animals is what its all about(along with DSOTM,WYWH, The Wall,Meddle and Obsured), So get away from the music today and buy a Floyd album,(I prefer you to get Darkside of the moon first) and then when you get a feel for floyd get Animals the best album ever, DOGS the 2nd song on the album is amazing even though its 17 minutes long its lyrics ROCK, and then you got PIGS(three different ones)and Sheep , 2 more songs that will blow your mind. You gotta hear it, I've been listening to Animals for 15 years now , and it don't get old.

B000063DIH|4.0|This is by far the most underrated Maiden album. It took time to grow on me but now I like it. No, its no Powerslave or Brave New World but it still worths some tracks to listen. One possible reasons this album gets bashed is that it include s**tty songs like 'Apparition' (one of Maidens worst songs ever), and 'Fear is the Key'. The highlights here are 'Be Quick Or Be Dead', 'Afraid To Shoot Strangers' and the title track, which 2 of them are true Maiden classics (namely ATSS, and the title track), unlike the other 90's Maiden albums which included some nice songs but not \\"Maiden Classics\\". 'Afriad' talks about the first war in Iraq in 1990 (you can see in the video with Blaze), then it in the 2nd half it becomes heavier with many guitar solos. The title track in is in my top 5 favorite Maiden songs (honestly), it has quiet intro and then it becomes heavy with great lyrics and amazing solo. Another interesting song is 'From Here to Eternity' which closes tha Charlotte-saga they started in their debut with 'Charlotte the Harlot', continued in Number of the Beast and No Prayer for the Dying in '22 Acacia Avenue' and 'Hooks in You', but sadly this song is average at best. More songs I liked from the album are 'Be Quick Or Be Dead',  'Childhoods End', 'Wasting Love', and 'Judas Be My Guide'.     Ratings:    Be Quick Or Be Dead- 10/10  From Here To Eternity- 7/10  Afraid to Shoot Strangers- 10/10  Fear is the Key- 3/10  Childhoods End- 9/10  Wasting Love- 10/10  Fugutive- 7/10  Chains of Misery- 6/10  Apparition- 1/10  Judas Be My Guide- 10/10  Weekend Warrior- 6/10  Fear of the Dark- 20/10    This is by far the best 90's Maiden album, its Certainly better than No Prayer for the Dying, Virtual XI, X Factor hits close to it, but it has no real standouts like the title track here. If you are into Maiden DON'T skip this one, either if you are new to Maiden I'd recommend to start with Powerslave but this is really worth listening.  Enjoy :)
B0009W5JR8|1.0|There is no consideration for life in this movie. One of the so called \\"good guys\\" in the movie blows up an entire train with a missile in order to kill one single bad guy. He does this WITHOUT asking if there are innocent people still on-board. <br /> <br />In another appalling scene, you'll see \\"nameless\\" security members gets hurt and killed, but by stroke of luck, the main stars escape danger without a single scratch on their bodies.  <br /> <br />To Ice Tray (or whatever your name is) = Vin Dissel you are not, James Bond you are not !
0930289528|5.0|At its heart, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is about two very similar men, separated and drawn into a bloody duel to the death, and yet bound together by an umbilicus called the Fate Computer, each willing to sacrifice anything and everything for an idea.<br /><br />In this regard, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is a tale about cruelly separated twins, a kind of \\"Prince and the Pauper\\" for the Orwellian post-nuclear age.<br /><br />The men? The anonymous terrorist firebrand 'V', cloaked and booted and features masked in the costume of Guy Fawkes, the infamous 17th century terrorist who plotted, in vain, to blow up Parliament.<br /><br />On the other side of the looking glass, the titular 'Head' of a post-apocalyptic, riot-ravaged England's fascist government, Adam Susan, a man buoyed to power on the shoulders of the Norsefire brigades that brought order out of chaos in the final days of a tottering, damned British Empire.<br /><br />Both men are extremists in their fashion: willing to kill for their ideals: one for pure, unfettered, anarchic Liberty, the other for Order.<br /><br />Both offer ideas they will kill and maim and ruin for.<br /><br />Both embody and enshrine a Grave Lady as the incarnation of their veneration: both of these Dark Ladies, Lady Justice, and Lady Fate, have betrayed their idealistic lovers, in fashions that will not, until late in the tale, become apparent in scope or nastiness.<br /><br />Is it not startling, not dreadful, the extent to which we Men, mere brutes in clothes, will draw daggers and plunge them bloodily deep for our mistresses, our Despot, tyrant Ideas?<br /><br />It is best, I think, to leave you only the barest of essentials as to the nature of \\"V for Vendetta\\", because you're best to experience the cold grue of our rooftop bomb-thrower for yourself, with no preconceived ideas.<br /><br />Know this: the World of the 20th century has ended. It has boiled over, and burned away. The Cold War flared hot: the missiles traveled up over the Poles, crossed, rained down on the adversaries. The American silos in Britain, long protested, had been rendered toothless, the missiles moved off British soil: and so Britain was spared, while Europe died.<br /><br />In this cold, guttering world of Death and brutality, this charnel house London that lies prostrate beneath the blackened spires of Westminster, is it not too difficult to conclude that the Dead are the lucky ones?<br /><br />The story is simple and stark: that the graphics and colors by David Lloyd are comparatively crude (by the standards of Moore's \\"Watchmen\\", which I read immediately before \\"V\\") only enhance the feral, desperate quality of this brave new world. The chary illustrations and the bleeding colors only underscore a sense of wan desperation, of brutal plans drawing to a close, of beauty profaned and lost.<br /><br />This is all you should know: young Evey is filched from the deadly clutches of the Head's sadistic Fingermen, seconds after her bumbling attempts at an assignation go horribly wrong---filched from their clutches into the chordite-lined 17th century gloves of \\"V\\", a brooding vigilante who stalks the chimney pots of this Dead New London, spinning out couplets, unleashing death and destruction.<br /><br />She survives, and regains her health, in the confines of his lair, and becomes willing---but uncomprehending---accomplice to his war against Adam Susan's 'tyranny'.<br /><br />The devilish brilliance of Alan Moore's \\"V for Vendetta\\" is that Moore never forces us to choose sides. Granted, we are given very little of the Disloyal Opposition's view, while by contrast we are bathed in the ambivalent, enigmatic world of V's Shadow Gallery.<br /><br />Both V and Susan promise liberation: one from the shackles of tyranny, the other from the jaws of disorder. Susan gives us shadow-men pounding on your door at 3 in the morning, anonymous death by truncheon out behind the chemical shed: V gives us terrorist bombings and enlightenment through torture?<br /><br />How can we choose? And what greater horror, really, is concealed behind the Mask?<br /><br />JSG
B0001ZX0OC|3.0|With a stellar cast, murder, betrayal, and suspense, Mystic River delivers. A blue-collar Bostonian community is ripped apart by a beautiful girl's murder; an unbalanced wife confides in the enemy, and the vengeful, tormented father, commits the unimaginable. Bring on more drama, tears, sweat, and rage in a father grieving and THAT would have left us at the edge of our seats. Aside from that, are we to believe that a man so sympathetic to his friend could actually murder his daughter? Where was the guilt that would have convinced us that David Boyle was capable of committing the crime? Too, the fact that an innocent man dies at the hands of a sick, twisted friend-is indeed a tragedy. I felt cold inside after watching this movie.
1401207138|5.0|\\"Whoever fights Monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a Monster.\\"---Friedrich Nietzsche<br /><br />\\"Quis Custodiet ipsos Custodes?\\"---Ancient Roman phrase, translates to \\"Who Watches the Watchmen?\\"<br /><br />Hobbes, centuries ago, wrote that a life lived among Men \\"in the State of Nature is nasty, brutish, and short\\".<br /><br />Hobbes was optimistic.<br /><br />Man is a beast, born red in tooth and claw in the bosom of blood-soaked Nature, and as a beast he is bound to slaughter his fellow. In the forest primeval, that meant with teeth and claws; then spear and sword, catapult and blackpowder rifle.<br /><br />And so we tread fearfully upon the stage of the Present: the Curtain is raised, the stagelights turned up, the audience restless, shifting and murming and coughing out in the Dark. The first act of this play---\\"Watchmen\\"---will literally be a highdive to the pavement, performed, most appropriately, by a player known as The Comedian.<br /><br />It's a real showstopper.<br /><br />It is the Present: October 12th, 1985. Nixon is still in the White House, a white-hot popular four-termer and still as paranoid crazy as a hungry sewer rat; Man is still red in tooth and claw. And he still hungers for the blood of his fellow; but this time, he fights with nuclear-tipped ICBMs. The Doomsday clock stands at 5 to Midnight, and the Hour is far later than we think.<br /><br />At its core, it is a very simple tale, as the best tales usually are: it is a murder mystery.<br /><br />The calculating subversive brilliance of Alan Moore's legendary \\"Watchmen\\" is that it takes the notion of the superhero---masked avenger of Justice and the American Way---and inverts it.<br /><br />Case in point here: what is the use of a costumed crime-fighter, dedicated to protecting Man against thugs and robbers and supervillains, when Mankind itself is on the chopping block? What's the good of a cape, a mask, and a stealthy Owlship---or all the money and acumen in the world---when the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are about to ride out, led by nuclear missiles arcing up over the poles?<br /><br />And to make things a little stranger: why now, after all these years, and when Humanity is on the verge of extinction, is someone murdering the old crimefighters?<br /><br />And so we begin, with an entry from Rorschach's diary as that most troubled and cannily paranoid of crimefighters puzzles his way into he mystery of who would have beaten the life out of the Comedian, then flung him through his plate glass apartment window to do a belly flop on the hardtop hundreds of feet below. That thread weaves its way through the lives of Watchmen's heroes, old and new, flitting back and forth between the seemingly more innocent Golden Age and back again into the Darker present.<br /><br />And maybe that's why \\"Watchmen\\" serves up such a shock: it delivers us into a mythology and a world already created. There is a backstory here, just as established and confident by its lights as that of Batman, Superman, or Spider-Man, yet seamier, more rueful, more flawed. Infinitely human.<br /><br />Initially we are on the outside looking in: into a world where the elderly crimefighters and their young successors have lost their government sanction and move into early retirement, where the brutal, anarchic knot-tops rule the streets while pundits chatter nervously about Nuclear Brinksmanship, a twilight world of regret and loss and nostalgia, where the old Night-Owl rents a pre-war apartment over his auto-garage while his former arch-nemesis Moloch the Magician rots from cancer a few blocks away.<br /><br />We don't stay outside long. Moore is a genius when it comes to pacing: we arc in deep and long on Watchmen's central characters as they come to terms with their own demons and the central mystery of the story. Rorschach, mind whirling behind its living mask; the new Night-Owl Dan Dreiberg, awash in a paunchy middle-age but compelled by events to something more.<br /><br />Or Laurie Juspeczyk, the new Silk Spectre, increasingly unhappy with her lover Dr. Manhattan (less human by the day and reeling from a vicious PR attack) and fearful of turning into her vain and lonely mother. And finally Adrian Veidt, the vaunted superhero Ozymandias and now globe-trotting billionaire and business tycoon, the \\"smartest man in the world\\".<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" is a wry concoction of its times, insanely idiosyncratic, though it is not hard to imagine it conjured up today in our own troubled age: there is the looming threat of nuclear annihilation, mankind poised on the brink of apocalypse, menaced by the two tribes of the USA and the USSR, each on the verge.<br /><br />There is the notion of superhero as plaything of his times, with the exception of the 'freak' Doctor Manhattan, girded for war by an eager Pentagon, more superweapon than superhero.<br /><br />And there is the omnipresent question central to those who man the lonely ramparts of civilization against savagery, illustrated by the juxtaposition of the pulpily gory \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\", with its desperate, inventive, deeply moral hero transformed into a beast by the hellscape through which he must venture to save his imperiled family---an echo of the \\"Quis Custodiet\\" implied by the title.<br /><br />This is rich, heady, deliciously vorpal stuff, beautifully mounted with rich trappings and sumptuous depth of plot and character.

B00005JO0J|5.0|I know that the above statement is a rather bold claim, and one that's been made many times over. However, this time, it rings true for all those who take the chance and see the movie.  <br /> <br />I wasn't a fan of the T.V. show when it aired on Fox. To be honest I scoffed at the idea, and considering I couldn't stand Buffy or Angel, I stayed away despite what I'd heard to the contrary. Then I heard that they were making a movie based on the T.V. show, and it got me interested enough to give the show a try through Netflix. Let me tell you now: Firefly is the best television show I've ever seen. <br /> <br />I'm a professional sci-fi/fantasy writer so I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan in general. Firefly had me hooked. I loved it. The writing is darn near perfect, as is the acting. The storytelling is just so well done, and Joss carried that over and stepped it up a notch with Serenity. <br /> <br />I've been a Star Wars fan since before I could talk. I was raised on it, along with Star Trek and everything else under the sun. I own every Star Wars book- have read them all at least twice. I've seen the movies hundreds of times. Joss said that with Serenity he was aiming to give the audience that feeling he had when he first saw Star Wars, even if they haven't ever seen the show. In my opinion, he accomplished that goal. Lets put it this way: As huge a Star Wars fan (and comic nerd for that matter) as I am, Serenity is the best movie I've seen all year. It beat out Revenge of the Sith. It beat out Batman Begins. So trust me, even if you've never seen a single episode of Firefly, give Serenity a shot.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I've been a Neil Young fan for over 10 years. He's been an important part of my life. I was first awstruck by the song \\"After the Gold Rush.\\" I wondered, when I first heard it, whose chilling falsetto voice is that with such amazing lyrics? I was driving when I heard the song and was just blown away..I can only compare his voice to that of the singer of Five for Fighting. I find it beautiful and unique. Like Neil, himself. <br />Prairie Wind starts with a mellow and catchy tune and then enters into a scene from Hawks and Doves with No Wonder. Very similar start off to \\"Captain Kennedy.\\" <br />Tracks 3, 4 and 5 really hit the road running. \\"Falling off the Face of the Earth\\" is a very pretty song. I especially love Neil's voice on this one and how he manages to even take it an octave higher. Very effective and melodic. <br />What really stirred me up was the next song, \\"Far from Home.\\" It's a blues/folksy song with horns intermixed (like from his album \\"This Notes for You.\\" You'll find yourself slapping your knee or stomping your foot on this one. The song itself is a reflection on family values, memories of growing up, his father and his longing for the stark tranquility of the prairie, which I can strongly relate to.. <br />Next, is my favorite song, \\"It's a Dream.\\" This is a masterpiece through and through. The way Neil conjours up images of the past and explains them is amazing. The song brings visions of a simpler and better time. A boy fishing under a bridge, the blueness of the sky, the winds of autumn, an old man taking time to talk to a policeman when policeman had time to chat, the imagery of a train station and its passengers departing into the prairie. For Neil, these were days passed by that he is longing for again. A more innocent time. This song brought tears to my eyes for so many reasons. Almost like \\"A Man Needs a Maid\\" does for me when I hear the lyrics \\"..when will I see you again?..\\"  <br />Here there is a more classical music sound mixed with the tune.  <br />Of course, you'll never hear it on mainstream radio due to being too lengthly and actually having substance. Truly a great song that makes you think of your own good memories. Neil really gets in your head with this song. <br />It truly, to me, is one of Neil Young's most amazing songs ever made. <br />\\"Prairie Wind\\", \\"Here For You\\" and \\"This Old Guitar\\" all are very good songs, as well. \\"This Old Guitar\\" seems to come from Harvest Moon and is very nice. \\"Prairie Wind\\" is catchy with repeated chorus verses by backup singers (I think Pegi, his wife, and Emmylou Harris) <br />\\"He Was The King\\" is a tribute to Elvis and \\"When God Made Me\\" is almost a gospel song. I could easily see churches using these lyrics for their choirs to sing. It's a nice song asking questions of belief, existence and why we're all here. I heard Neil play this live and liked it.  <br />All in all, this album fuses sounds from Harvest, Harvest Moon, On The Beach, This Notes for You, Silver and Gold and Greendale in a very smart way. Neil is always changing and inventing himself. This is why I love his music and presence so much.  <br />I can't wait to see what's next.  <br />Great effort by the master!  <br /> <br />
B00005JO0J|5.0|I'm a Browncoat...I saw the movie and, tho I wish it hadn't been so painful, I want to thank Joss for creating it!  Great effects, great humor, and great loss...but it ended on a high...can't wait to see the next story.  Also need to see it a few more times before the DVD comes out...shiny!
B000AAF276|2.0|If, like me, you found Mr. Clapton sublime and in the pocket with \\"Unplugged,\\" \\"Me and Mr. Johnson,\\" and \\"Riding With The King\\" (his duet with BB), be careful before you purchase this album.  <br /> <br />This is an imitative pastiche of recently fashionable pop cliches - 20 years ago for some, and 10 years ago for others. Aside from a couple of nifty flourishes, nothing distinguishes this album. It sounds like Clapton doing Kareoke. He even cops a Lionel Ritchie/Soul Chick groove on one song; it's horrible, even though his pipes are up to the required high notes. So, you might want to sit this one out. He'll be back.
0380789035|4.0|I disagree with those who think the ending fizzled.  If you're looking for a sacrine \\"happily-ever-after,\\" this doesn't have it, but the ending is satisfying and fits the story.  Well worth the ride.
B00005A3KS|3.0|Well its Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves in a movie about surfers who rob banks and sky dive.  I have no idea what else to say about this movie.  It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't.
B00005JNTX|5.0|While there are 3 stories going on in this interesting looking movie, the one that makes this movie worth watching again and again is the Big Fat Kill! Mickey Rourke plays Marv a hard-hitting, gritty fighter ready to kill his way to the answer. No bull logic for Marv, he's all about fists and beat downs. He meets a beautiful woman (prostitute) who treats him like a decent human despite his horrid looks. While he's having a good time with her, he wakes up the next day and finds that she's been murdered right next to him. Marv goes berserk against the cops, hoodlums, everyone! He keeps remembering that she was the one person who treated him decent and now it was time to pay back the lowlife that took her life. <br /> <br />Marv goes to the edge of the gutter and beyond to find the answers. He makes some funny revelations along the way that will have you laughing your socks off.  Be warned though, it gets disturbingly, graphic in the scenes with Elijah Wood as Kevin a catlike killer. As if Elijah Wood wasn't weird enough, we see him really do a number on Marv but the revenge Marv takes on him may be a little too much for most people to bear. I'm telling you all, there's a scene with Marv and Kevin that's the most horridly disgusting scene in the entire movie. The other stories are really intriguing as well as managing to bring all the stories to a nice logical ending. Karma is at work throughout this movie so don't worry, everyone will get what they deserve except maybe poor Marv. <br /> <br />Sin City is definitely following the comic book making sure to try and hold up the comic book look. It is one of the few unique looking movies that have several well-known stars in it. I figured with all the big names in the movie it would be a flop because usually star powered movies are bad. However, Sin City is not one of them. If you are looking for some classic action, gun-toting characters, and an all around unique experience take a look at Sin City. Make sure to take noteof the Big Fat Kill!!!!! <br />
B00004UEDQ|4.0|Funny, yet still has its moments of sobriety, no pun intended.  A pretty honest look at rehab, but in the form of a comedy, it is both interesting and entertaining.  Definately worth renting at the least.  Fans of Sandra Bullock will like this movie.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|John Constantine is one character that you'll have fun watching over and over. I own this dvd and I'm glad I do. As many comic book fans probably already know John Constantine can be a man of mystery not just a man of the occult. He has many faces and shows in several different comic book plots in different forms. Overall, Constantine is a rough talking, rough riding, antihero we love to love. Is Constantine a villain or a hero? I don't think he fits into either category well because he's a mixture of both yet contains something more than those choices can provide. In this movie, you see the hoodoo believing, demon destroying, antihero Constantine. Constantine just wants to go to heaven and be done with the perils and pains of earthly life but fears that only Hell awaits him. He committed suicide as a teenager because the so-called gift of seeing demons felt more like a train wreck through fire. So Constantine decided to end the whole mess and got a first class ticket to Hell where the fire seers you to a crispy corpse. <br /> <br />Constantine was brought back only to forever remember the glimpse of hell. He even has a one way open invitation back to Hell as soon as he dies. Now that's the kind of bargain no one wants. So Constantine basically spends most of his time sending demons back to Hell and fearing his beat down for doing it once he reaches Hell with them. His quirky sidekick Chas (who looks deceptively younger than he's supposed to according to the comic books) is played by Shia Labeouf. Shia does a good job in here for the little screen time he has but he proves himself to be worth watching. Midnight played by Djimon Hounsou looks so cool! He gives a great performance for his short screen time and adds a deeper flavor of coolness and masculine drive that powers the seriousness of the storyline home.  <br /> <br />I would suggest this movie for anyone who wants to see Keanu Reeves managing to make a decent Constantine. You won't be screaming in anger at this one, you'll want to get those cool tattoos on Keanu's forearms and chant, \\"Into the light I command thee!\\" over and over. Most importantly watch this movie if you want to know how to go to Hell just to see what it looks like. Constantine will show you how to do it, it involves a cat, some water.....hmmm anyways, watch to find out. <br />
B000063DFQ|5.0|WoW! Where to start? This album is just so darn good. Piece of Mind is it for me, it is the album that I cherish and listen to the most. I listen to Piece of Mind on a consistent basis and it still doesn't get old. Every song in Piece of Mind is great, but in different ways.  <br /> <br />Where Eagles Dare opens up the album, and wow, what a way to kickoff a great album. The song opens up with nice but short drum intro. Where Eagles Dare is mostly instrumental and has some very catchy \\"spitfire\\" riffs that neatly match the song.  <br /> <br />Revelations comes next, and it is one my favorite songs. I especially love the soft peace in the middle where Bruce sings with passion. Revelations also has some great guitar solos towards the end. Perhaps the best song that Bruce has ever written (with Powerslave closely behind). <br /> <br />The next track is Flight of Icarus, which was one of the big hits off of the album. The pace is slowed down a tad for FLight of Icarus, but nontheless, it's a great song that has a very catchy chorus and some great riffs that stick in your head for a long time. <br /> <br />Then comes Die With Your Boots on, which has one of my favorite intros to the song that consist of some catchy riffs with great bass work. The song then goes into a nice fast rocker. I especially love the two guitar solos in Die With Your Boots On, and I also love the backing vocals that are present during parts of the song, (they come from Adrian Smith I believe). <br /> <br />The Trooper. WOW! This is the song that got me hooked to Maiden a few years back. The dual guitar riff/harmony that is played throughout the song was stuck in my head for days. Everybody in the band shines in The Trooper. Nicko's drumming is great, Steve's bass is phenomenal as always, Dave and Adrian compliment each other really nicely, and Bruce sounds really great.  <br /> <br />After The Trooper, comes Still Life which is sadly one of the most underrated maiden songs ever. After the openingbackwards message, the song goes into a nice soft ballad-like feel. Bruce comes in and starts singing with a nice whisperish-soft tone, but then the song kicks off, and off we go! Still Life is yet another great song in a great album. <br /> <br />Well, next comes Quest for Fire, which is perhaps the maiden song that is ridiculed the most for having some silly lyrics. I torally agree, the cavemen lyrics are quite comical, but the instrumental aspect of the song is actually good. It's still a good listen and is not a bad song by any means necessary. <br /> <br />Then comes Sun and Steel, which is also a nice fast tune. It has a nice catchy sing-along chorus with great guitar work. Sun and Steel is yet another great song. <br /> <br />The album closes off very strong with the epic To Tame a Land. This song is quite underrated when compared to masterpieces such as Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but it's still one heck of a good song that is up there with other great Maiden epics such as Phantom of the Opera, Hallowed be thy Name, and Rime of the Ancient Mariner. <br /> <br />To conclude, Piece of Mind is a great album and is definetaly worth a purchase. The 15$ I spend on this album has to be on the best investments I've ever done. If you haven't purchased Piece of Mind yet, then there is huge void in your music collection. If you haven't done so yet, purchase Piece of Mind now!

B00005JO0J|5.0|I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a movie as fully as I enjoyed Serenity. The movie moves fast, from start to finish, quickly recapping some of the important parts from the TV series, and then diving into new territory. The characters are memorable, and I truly felt for them, something that I seldom find in films recently. <br /> <br />Truly, the film has everything. Humour, action, sadness, some kick-ass over the top fight sequences, and a whole lot of swearing in Chinese. Highly recommended!
B0009H1CK6|5.0|A great come back from Nile Rodgers and Chic in this DVD. Splendid presentation. New musicians and singers but the sound is the same, unmistakable. The hands of Nile on guitar still play with the magic of the 70'S. What a show . It's an essential DVD to fans of the disco era.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I am one of those girlfriends who was dragged to see this movie because her boyfriend loved the series.  I have been forced to watch an upteeth number of episodes of Star Treck, (I do on the other hand love the ORIGIONAL Star Wars.)  I didn't really go to this movie with an open mind, but it was fantastic.  I watched the piolet and only the piolet of Firefly so i did not have the backroud to the show.  The movie was engaging from the first moments.  The acting was fantastic.  There was nothing boring or to scince fictioney in it.  This movie has a great story, acting, and cast. Peirod.
0671578855|5.0|The frothy (and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny) \\"A Civil Campaign\\" is the next to last (so far) in the saga of Miles Vorkosigan. If \\"Komarr,\\" the previous novel in the series, was the darkest, \\"A Civil Campaign\\" is the lightest. The author bills it as \\"A Comedy of Biology and Manners,\\" and that's precisely what it is. Call it a \\"space operetta,\\" if you like.<br /><br />Ms. Bujold centers this take around Miles's pursuit of the hand of Ekaterin, widowed at the end of \\"Komarr,\\" which really should be read before you tackle this one. And there are subplots inivolving Miles's clone brother Mark, designer goody-producing insects, and much intrigue concerning the various members of the Council of Counts, among them Count Dono, who--err, no. Best not to spoil the fun. Suffice it to say that all ends well.
1590581814|5.0|Occasionally #1 comes up with the correct rating for a book even though, in this case, she is confused about the central character's name.  James Sallis has crafted an excellent noir thriller -- like a complicated mosaic -- from small, tantalizing fragments in the life of Driver, a Hollywood stunt driver who moolights behind the wheel of getaway cars.  Driver is so cool his pores exude frost rather than sweat.    As the story begins, people are trying to kill Driver because of a Phoenix heist that went wrong.  Flashbacks from Driver's past life are interspersed with those from the robbery and his present efforts to extricate himself from his predicament.      Sallis transmutes a simple double-cross and revenge plot into a stylish tour de force.  Highly recommended.

B0009ZHJ7S|3.0|Robots is a really sweet and cute movie. It was actually funny. I for one hated Ice Age, so this movie was a real pleasure. Williams is hilarious, like his normal self. Great voices, a simple story, and an enjoyable movie.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Firefly was the short lived series on Fox back in 2002 which only lasted 12 episodes on air but there were 15 episodes in all. Serenity takes the series up to a whole new level and it packs a wallop of a good time and come on, Joss Whedon knows how to please his fans of Firefly and of course Buffy and Angel. Simon Tam, played by Sean Maher rescues his sister River Tam, played by Summer Glau because their doing experiments on her, putting things in her head, images. Their picked up by Serenity, and the crew consists of Captain Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds, played by the always fantastic Nathan Fillion (Tv's Buffy, Water's Edge) and he is superb here, the pilot Wash, played by funny man Alan Tudyk (Dodgeball, 28 Days) and his wife Zoey, played by Gina Torres (Tv's Angel, Matrix Revolutions). Tough and Ready To Rumble Jayne, played by a kooky Adam Baldwin (Tv's Angel, Independence Day). Kaylee Frye, played by the adorable Jewel Staite who's an engineer and knows a lot about ships and how to fix them and who also is in love with Doctor Simon Tam. They rob a vault in one town on a planet and wind up being chased down by the Reavers, crazy as hell dudes who pillage and kill people just for the hell of it and their ships consist of human bones and blood. The Operative, played by a calm, cool and wicked Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers, Dirty Pretty Things), wants to kill River Tam because within her lies a secret they want to bury. The crew find out that River Tam can get a little bit on the violent side as she is triggered. Later, the gang find out the secret of the  world \\"Miranda\\", a small planet with Reavers inhabiting it's orbit and they find that everyone on the planet it dead because whoever it was wanted everyone to get along but it went array and some of the people turned mean, raged, hence why there are The Reavers. So, the gang go to Mr. Universe, played by David Krumholtz (Tv's Numbers) in an amusing role to try to spread the word on what the alliance did to Miranda and what the outcome came...that's if they make it in time, and alive. Fast, lean, awesome....even better then Firefly, filled with that great Joss Whedon touch of humor, action, romance and drama. One of the best movies of the year so far, by far greater then, yes I  am saying this and I mean it, Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith....so long George Lucas..who cares if your movie made millions of dollars at the box office, Serenity is here to stay and hopefully Joss Whedon gets to do more of this down the line..say and Angel movie or something or a new Buffy movie....the first one wasnt that great...let's hope. Whedon kills off two main characters from the series, Alan Tudyk's Wash and Ron Glass's Shepard Book. A truely satisfying movie.
B000055Y12|3.0|Despite the failure of \\"Torn Curtain\\", Hitchcock decided to make another Cold War spy thriller. Based on the Leon Uris novel of the same name, \\"Topaz\\" is meant to be an exciting and suspenseful spy drama. However, it comes off as poor excuse for a James Bond movie.<br /><br />If that last comment seemed harsh, don't take it to heart. \\"Topaz\\" has actually aged fairly well. It isn't a masterpiece and pales in comparison to even \\"Torn Curtain\\", but it sill makes for an entertainign film.<br /><br />The film's plot involves a CIA agent (John Forsythe) who has French operative by the name of Deveraux (Frederick Stafford) go to Cuba and intercept Russian missile rumors and a Nato spy named Topaz. While in Havana, Deveraux's investigation becomes riskier with each move. People are double crossed, mudered and comitting suicide. When he returns home to Paris, the danger builds, leading up to a predictable but overall satisfying end.<br /><br />The film does have some good things going for it. It is far from Hitch's best work, but some of the scenes are fantastic. The acting is top notch as well, especially Stafford, John Vernon and Forsythe. The extras are cool, especially the three alternate endings. I don't highly recommend \\"Topaz\\", but it certainly won't be a waste if you buy it.

0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Pyscho\\" is one of those films that, when you start to review it, you're immediately at a loss for words. Why? Because there's nothing left to say that hasn't already been said about it. This film has been studied endlessly by film scientists, every nook and cranny has been analyzed to the bone. I mean, we all know that the shower scene is the greatest scene in any film. And that Norman Bates is the greatest horror movie character ever. And that this film still scares the crap out of you after 45 years.<br /><br />So, I'm just going to make this shrot and sweet and say that if you haven't seen this movie, you must see it. Get it on dvd as soon as possible.
B0009VRHLK|3.0|\\"The Brown Bunny\\" is, in many ways, the antithesis of the American movie.  It is not loud, contains no explosions, nor is it marred by the quick-cut editing necessary to keep the attention of the MTV generation.  It is, however, guilty of the narcissism of Hollywood's \\"high concept\\" bore fests.  Gallo takes an effective short story and tries to stretch it into a novel.  Like Kubrick on morphine, Gallo drags us through pointless scenes that seemingly go on forever.  The DVD version is almost a half hour shorter than the version shown at Canne.  (I simply can't imagine staying conscious through the longer cut.)  The infamous final scene puts everything in perspective, but is so jarring to the viewer that is disengages us from the film.  The viewer is so caught up in wondering (a) is it real, (b) how did he convince Chloe to do the scene, (c) how was it shot, etc. that he/she is catapulted out of the film's hypnotic trance.  Thumbs up for Gallo and Chloe's willingness to push the boundaries and take chances in an industry prone to cookie-cutter standards.  Thumbs down for this Uneasy Rider that drowns in its own admiration.
0783240236|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock finished off his quartet of masterpieces between 1958 and 1963 with this classic thriller about birds run (or is it flown?) amok. It was his last film before many feel he hit a decline, as many feel everything after \\"The Birds\\" was weak.<br /><br />Beautiful blonde Melanie Daniels (\\"Tippi\\" Hedren in her film debut) has arrived in beautiful Bodega Bay, where she falls in love with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). One day, a seagull attacks her without reason. Soon, bird attacks are reported around the town, as our feathered friends target school children and residents in horrifying strings of attacks. Mitch and Melanie must rely on their wits and each other before it's too late.<br /><br />\\"The Birds\\" is truly a masterpiece. edren excels in her first film role, and the rest of the cast is great. Hitchcock directed this film with fist clenching assuredness, and some of his finest camerawork is present on this film. The extras are great. If you don't own \\"The Birds\\", then what are you waiting for?
0399152717|2.0|I think I've read everything Mr. Cussler has had published. Sorry to say, Polar Shift is boring. If I had to guess, some marketing person talked Mr. Cussler into this co-authoring and subsequently cheating us, the buying public. I'm pretty sure I won't buy another co-authored book, period. If you want to read Mr. Cussler at his best, look for an earlier book. They can be some of the best entertainment reading there is. But, I won't recommend Polar Shift. <br /> <br />Kurt Austin is a 'watered down' Dirk Pitt. I wish Mr. Cussler had explored the more human and flawed side of a Dirk Pitt in Kurt Austin instead of making him less exciting and stopping there.  <br />
0790749815|5.0|The period betweeen 1958 and 1963 was perhaps the most productive time in Alfred Hitchcock's career. In those five years, he made what are arguably his four greatest films: \\"Vertigo\\", \\"North By Northwest\\", \\"Pyscho\\" and \\"The Birds\\". It's hard tp pick which one of those films is THE best, but I think those are his four best films.<br /><br />The second movie in that quartet, \\"North By Northwest\\" is the subject of this review. Cary Grant reteams with Hitchcock for his fourth and last film with the Master of Suspense to play Roger Thornhill, a Manhattan advertising exec who is mistaken for a spy and is kidnapped by an organization trying to shut him up. Their leader (a menacing James Mason) as well as his ruthless henchmen (includign a young Martin Landou) will stop at nothing to see Thornhill out of the way, as he frames him for murder, chased across the country, and in one of the finest and most parodied scenes in motion picture history, nearly mowed down by a crop duster. To elude from harm, he enlists the help of beautiful counterspy Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). However, the enemies get wind of this, and now are more forceful than ever. This leads to an unforgettable climax atop Mount Rushmore.<br /><br />Well, wow. This film is incredible. Cary Grant's performance in this film may well be the best of his career. The same can be said for Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. Hitchcock's work behind the camera is very creative. His directing for the crop duster scene is, shot for shot, perfect. The extras are excellent. The featurette is highly enjoyable, as the commentary by screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who recently passed on. This dvd is a must for all movie fans.
B00005JO0J|1.0|The applause from the movie audience was a lot louder before the film started than when it ended. Since this was opening night, packed with fans of the TV series, their lack of enthusiasm speaks a lot louder than words!<br /><br />I don't watch TV (gasp), so I haven't seen a single episode of the supposedly wonderful series. As a lover of sci-fi, my mind was wide open. What I saw was one of the most godforsaken awful formula movies of my entire life. A modern day cowboys and Indians flick geared towards the mentality a 15-year-old boy with way too much time on his hands!<br /><br />In the world of Serenity the stakes are high because the guys in the black hats are gonna eat ya alive, quite literally, if they catch ya! Or, you could get lucky, and just get a sword rammed through ya by a self-professed psychopath who in the end conveniently sprouts a conscience. Or better yet, we get to see a 90 pound, 17-year old, morose female, kill a roomful of blood thirsty, and hungry, fellers with her bare hands. So make sure you don't get her cranky! This movie is so twisted, disgusting and campy, I can't decide if it should be categorized as a horror flick or an out-of-control comedy. But it was so bad, it wasn't funny!<br /><br />I'm also sick and tired of a rather dangerous message running through this film: Government is bad because it oppresses the poor, innocent, good guys. If only the those liberal meanies would leave us alone nothing bad would ever happen! Boo-Ho! Yeah, right! This terribly misguided libertarian message of \\"no government is the best government,\\" simply does not hold water in the real world.<br /><br />One final question: How do Living Dead-type zombies, who are unable to utter a single word, other than arrrrrrgh, pilot high-tech spaceships with ease? How do these zombies have the smarts to maintain these ships, and even go toe-to-toe in battle with the big, bad government? It seems in the world of Serenity being a blood thirsty, insane, speech impaired mutant is no obstacle to success!<br /><br />I hope I have discouraged you from spending your hard earned money on this really rotten piece of celluloid. But if I have failed, please do not let your children see this film. You'll thank me later!<br /><br />P.S. For those of you who continuely fawn over this movie with cult-like adoration, I humbly suggest that you learn what REAL Science Fiction has to offer. It will take only one book to open narrow minds: \\"Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction,\\" edited by Neil Barron.

B00005OM5L|5.0|Eric Clapton always gets a 5 stars in my book, and why not? The man is a legend, an icon and went from a guitar-god to guitar virtuoso over the last four decades. He has done everything from early blues with John Mayall to early British Invasion pop with The Yardbirds, then Power Trio triumviant with Cream, to Blindfaith supergroup member, to sideman with Delaney & Bonnie, then created a seventies masterpiece with the album Layla, to a solo career that has taken him to highs and lows, to jamming with everyone from Stevie Ray Vaughn to B. B. King - and the list of acolades goes on ad infinitium.  <br />Eric Clapton Live at Hyde Park gives an overview of his career with such songs as Layla, I Shot The Sheriff, White Room and many more. But, where Clapton shines are on the various blues numbers this DVD contains. That is where the magic is and where Clapton gets to rip loose, just like every Clapton fan likes. You may not be familiar with some of the song titles of these blues gems, but that is where the mother load is on this one. If you are a Clapton fan and want to see the maestro at work, Live In Hyde Park is the ticket!

I am utterly amazed by the analog, fuzzy sound...it feels like a time-warp to some funky concert I would have gone to if I'd been born a decade earlier.  Some of the tunes on this release are so much fun to listen to they should be regulated.  I almost burned out the speakers in my car!

B00064MW6K|4.0|I'll get to the explaination of the title of my review in a momemt. I watched this movie and I liked it. I like any movie where a woman comes into her own and realizes how powerful she truly is, even if she has to die first, because when it comes down to it often a part of a woman does have to \\"die\\"  sometimes for her to find the inner strength she has actually always possessed but just didn't know it. I loved the way there was actually a HISTORY of how she was able to be brought back to life instead of just falling 100 stories out of a window and being chewed on and licked on by some cats and just coming back to life like Pfiefer did in one of those Batman movies. I like Halle Berry and respect what she has had to go through to be where she is today, and if I were going to dislike a movie she was in it would be Monsters Ball, because her ending up a@@ naked and screwing a bigot did nothing for me. I feel as if most of YOU PEOPLE disliked this movie because you feel HOW DARE SHE as a BLACK WOMAN take on the role of Catwoman. If this role had been portrayed by brittany or jessica, I feel the reviews would have been a lot kinder. The chemistry between her and Benjamin Bratt was HOT...so hot that I still remember an article in a magazine that said he got himself into a bit of trouble with his wife because he expressed to her how wonderful he found Halle. So for all of you haters out there, get over it, WE are here to stay and WE are able to take on roles that you feel WE shouldn't and do them justice no matter what you may think or say...and just to piss most of you off even more the best Catwoman there EVER has been was EARTHA KITT!!
B00099BPP6|5.0|This recording dates from the 60's and contains a first class cast that carries Verdi's vision with the utmost dedication and intensity.  Bergonzi's Duke is sheer macho swagger and arrogance and is as carefree as can be.  Bergonzi also has no problem slamming and sustaining the high c at the end of \\"La Donna e' mobile\\" and handles the rest of his part with the utmost ease and with elegant musical phrasing.  Fischer Dieskau is masterful in his interpretation of Rigoletto as he gives explicit heartfelt meaning to the words that he is singing so you can really feel the torment,love,rage,vengeance,and cruelty that spills from Rigoletto's soul.  Dieskau has a wonderful tone as well as the power,vocal security,and musical intelligence to make the most of his part.  The thing about Dieskau is that he's not here to just produce a wonderful sound but to possess the spirit of Rigoletto and there's no way to not be moved by such a soulful performance.  Scotto is near ideal in her interpretation of Gilda as we hear the innocent,gullible,and determined aspects dramatic wise combined with a staggering display of technical virtuoso vocal fireworks that could stand alongside the great Joan Sutherland.  Finally we come to conductor Rafael Kubelik who is mindblowing in this performance.  He is at once electrifying,precise,poetic,keenly dramatic,tender, and in tune to every aspect of Verdi's masterful score.  I've never heard this opera conducted better as Kubelik flys on a wave of inspiration that equals the intensity of a Toscannini with the depth of a Giulini. The sound quality is excellant with crisp clear sound and wide range and the booklet inside gives detail to each track though it is quite skimpy but then again it is a bargain.  This is a Rigoletto that is guaranteed to satisfy listeners who appreciate real opera.  When i say real opera i mean performers who not only sing the notes but performers who embrace and transform themselves into the characters that they are playing.Opera is not a recital but a complete art form and this particular recording gives you this in spades.  Go for it!    Oscar F.

1401301010|5.0|I admit that I probably have some bias toward this book because I'm a huge Red Hot fan, but IT WAS AMAZING. I read it during classes, on the way to and from classes, in place of doing work, and finished it in under a week. Anthony's level of articulation is incredible and inspiring. Rather than an autobiography of a rock star, its one of a man who happens to be a rock star. The book follows Anthony from before he was born until the moment he published it, through his trials and tribulations of family issues, drug addiction, escaping from rehabilitation centers, interventions, and the band. AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ.
B000AL730O|5.0|Nearly four years after the \\"middle-of-the-road\\" \\"Driving rain\\" album, Paul McCartney finally has create one of his best studio album in years. The wait was worth it. Having read some of the reviews, I have found some people thinking that such long standing artists such as McCartney who deliver new material are in some kind of special creative high peak, and  other people  who will dismiss new Paul product,  just because it is new material and that nothing can match his output in the seventy's,  or his work with the Beatles. This is very disappointing,  since this new album is  an exceptional one among all the good albums Paul has made over the years.  For sure, this is an album beautifully composed, arranged, and produced. Other albums Paul has put out in the last two  decades, have been better entertaining and up-tempo collection of songs, like 1997's beatles-esque \\"Flaming Pie\\", and 1999's  \\"have-a-party\\" \\"Run Devil Run\\". In fact, \\"Chaos...\\"  finds Paul in a darker mood, and  there is no guitar rocker or instant hits to find on it. If you're  looking for that classic Paul wail, hot guitar riffs or over-orchestrated songs, you will be disappointed. However, there are a handful of great highlights here, with an overall sound and atmosphere like  the 1968 \\"White album\\" or a vibe reminiscent of the before-wings \\"RAM\\".  <br /> <br />The record starts off with \\"Fine Line\\", a up tempo piano tune  that has a \\"Why don't we do it in the road\\" piano feeling, counterbalanced with the plaintive \\"How kind of you\\", full of dissonant chords. One of the best song is the poignant  \\"Jenny Wren\\",  played on acoustic guitar in finger-picking style,  a classic melody  which Paul has compared to \\"Blackbird\\" in an recent interview, but I think this song is more the daughter of \\"Michelle\\" or John's \\"Julia\\", with it minor/major ambiguity, and the feminine subject. \\"Friends To Go\\" is a \\"Traveling Wilbury's\\" sounding tune, and \\"At The Mercy\\" is a experimental piano tune, with interesting chords change and a laid back atmosphere. \\"English tea\\" is  the kind of old-fashioned song John and George would not agreed to put on a Beatles album; no matter, this piece will remains probably a long time in your head.  \\"Too much rain\\" is maybe a song Paul has written with a little  help from his friend John sitting on a cloud in heaven.    To my ears, this is a true Beatles song, like \\"Young boys\\"  on \\"Flaming pie\\". \\"A certain softness\\" is a relaxing bossa style tune, surpassing \\"Distractions\\" on \\"Flower in the dirt\\".  \\"Riding To Vanity Fair\\" remind me a couple of songs on the \\"Tears for Fears\\" album \\"Everybody loves a happy ending\\".  \\"Follow Me\\" is a nice  mid-tempo song, with a classic sounding quality.  \\"Promise To You Girl\\" is one of the best song on the CD. In fact, you have there  a classic, superb  piano tune that finds Paul at his best, featuring vocal harmonies similar to some bits of Queen. The next track \\"This never happened before\\" is the best love song Paul has written since \\"Only love remains\\" on \\"Press to play\\". The last track, \\"Anyway\\", is the great final coda to the album. The intro verse remind me Curtis Mayfield \\"People Get Ready\\", and manage to capture the same spiritual feeling. Anyway, this is pure McCartney genius. Make sure you keep listening after the end of this song. After about ten seconds of silence, an up tempo instrumental pops up ( remember...  the \\"Her majesty\\" trick at the end of Abbey Road...)   <br /> <br />Nigel Goodrich, who has worked with Radiohead and Beck, brings a new fresh sound to the proceedings,  but finally, the overall effect is still very Paul McCartney. Like on \\"McCartney I\\" and \\"McCartney II\\", Paul plays all the instruments, except  the strings arrangements added on some tracks. What is most impressive is McCartney's voice. It's amazing how he can reach the same high notes,  at sixty-three years old.   His musicianship is incredible. Even though there are songs here that aren't quite the best he has written, whatis good  is really good...  Good music,  and good lyrics too...  <br /> <br />For sure, another top notch release from McCartney... Buy it now...! <br />

0399152717|2.0|I always look forward to a new Clive Cussler release, but this time I was disappointed.  Actually, this is two times in a row, and I might quit buying if he doesn't come up with a decent story to go along with a great premise.  I was expecting a fun sea romp, but instead it felt like I was dragging an anchor to the finish.  I was hoping the book would get my mind off the two Gulf coast hurricanes that chased me and my family from our home twice.  First, I couldn't dislike the villian because he was so dully evil.  Second, the story was bloated like a beached red-tide fish!  Third, the plot seemed vaguely familiar to earlier Cussler books I've read.  However, I have to give credit to Cussler for the witty dialogue in parts that kept the \\"buddy\\" spirit alive with the characters.  On a brighter note, I bought the book being promoted with Polar Shift, and I found it original, exciting, and a real thrill ride.  Once in a blue moon I try a new author, and I'm glad I purchased David Brookover's \\"The Ancient Breed\\".  If you found Polar Shift just \\"okay\\" and lacking excitement, try The Ancient Breed.  Unlike Polar Shift, it took my mind off my family's hurricane troubles for awhile!
B0006L16N8|2.0|maybe we should look back and consider Rush of Blood to the Head more like the close comparison, but even then the emo-coated lengthiness of the overtones of the...how do i describe these ridiculous songs? it seems every song whose title otherwise suggests a dramatic soundtrack-style masterpiece turns out to be a soppy un-original dissapointment that will forever make the band oasis' least favorite to see in concert, if not everyone's...
B0000027I6|5.0|In my opinion, after Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall, this is Roger Waters' best work. You might hear it as a mixture of these two albums, on the other hand, it could be the continuation, or even, the second part of The Wall. It is very well done. Jeff Beck appears in it, and as usual, he sounds great, in fact, he is one of the reasons that made me buy this one (without hearing it before). And I do not regret it.    The quality of the sound is extraordinary.    I have not heard such quality of work from Waters since The Wall. I guess this one is way under rated. I do not know how come it is not well known.    I hope he could release another one like this.    If you are a Pink Floyd fan, or Progressive sound, you will love it.    Buy it, no regrets.
0425166805|3.0|In Chariots of the Gods?, Erich Von Daniken argues that ancient man was visited by a spacefaring race. It was with the aid of these \\"spacemen\\", or at their behest, that ancient monuments like the pyramids and the Nazca lines were created. Encounters with this alien race, which Von Daniken argues interbred with mankind thousands of years ago, led to tales of \\"gods\\" that would become the religions of the world. <br /> <br />It's an interesting enough premise that must have seemed pretty fresh when this was published in 1969, but the author is too married to his theory. He GUSHES when he writes. His whole argument tends to circle around variations of, \\"We're not sure how the pyramids were built, so why couldn't spacemen have done it? If the world's religions have so many themes and images in common, like the flood, couldn't it have been aliens?\\" He discounts entirely the idea that these ancients cultures were capable of huge tasks, such as creating the Easter Island monuments. <br /> <br />Entertaining, but ultimately not very convincing.
B000026OHN|5.0|That is to say I won't be listening to Glenn Gould's Bach any time soon since I've discovered this gem of a Bach recording. It would be an understatement to call it a revelation when I first heard this recording, wow!. The first prelude immediately sets the tone, I knew right away at that moment I was listening to something special and I had to have it!. I haven't felt so anxious about a classical recording in a very , VERY long time, over a timespan of just 8yrs that is, but still!. Even the prospect of a new Slayer recording didn't excite me this much!. Interesting detail, Kerry King, the infamous guitartamer from Slayer listens to Bach as well, I guess he rocks as hell!.  <br /> <br />My opening remark is a bit harsh regarding Glenn Gould, but that was how I felt when I got acquainted with Richter's Bach, it's like going from one extreme to the other, from Gould being the technically proficient and stupendiously fast notecracker with overwhelming dynamics and unearthly beautifull tone (yeah, he is a genius ,still, and I prefer his eccentricity in playing) to Richter who possesses all of wich Gould represents, but with that little bit more extra in musical insight, touch and genius that makes his version of the Welltempered Klavier THE golden standard.  <br />Previously I preferred Edwin Fischer's version wich is also magnificent, but the average recording quality (it was recorded between '33 and '36 so what do you expect, but still a fantastic achievement!) bummed me a bit from fully appreciating it, but before Richter this one was my golden standard, I should say check it out for about half the price of Richter's. <br />  <br />Although I still don't think that Gould has been dethroned as the greatest Bach performer (for me personally that is),because he stands in a league of his own, I do know now why I felt an unexplainable unease when listening to most (not all) of Gould's \\"mechanical\\" Bach, I thought I was lacking musical insight or taste to fully appreciatehis genius , but now Richter has made it all clear to me.  <br /> <br />ps: please do check out Richter's DVD 'The Enigma'. As a person not as appealing as Gould, though ;)
B000050FEN|4.0|Although somewhat grisly I enjoyed this movie more in concept than perhaps as a viewing experience. The killer's modus operandi is a fascinating if macabre one, killing his victims in a way that symbolizes their main mortal sin, and suggesting that the murderer's motivation is a moral and religious one. They say almost all deliberate murders have a motivation, and if so this is a creative although bizzare one.<br /><br />I've heard people talk about movies like this as representing the moral and ethical decline of American society, and that explains our fascination with movies like this one and The Silence of the Lambs. They then back up this claim with the fact that the U.S. has the highest violent crime, murder, and rape statistics of any advanced western country.<br /><br />Perhaps, but what can you say? We Americans are just cowboys and maybe that explains our fascination with violence as much as anything, and the way violence is glorified on TV and in the movies. Being somewhat cynical about humans and their motivations as well as society as a whole I find such accusations somewhat moot, since all human societies have violence--some just have more than others. Let's face it, humans are just not very peaceable creatures. We didn't get to the top of the evolutionary pyramid by being pacifistic wallflowers.<br /><br />Whether that explains the violence obsessed culture in the U.S. or not I can't say. However, one thing that is clear from crime and demographic statistics is that even such low-crime countries as Canada are experiencing an increase in murder and violent crime. Of course, the cynics just say that's because of their close proximity to the U.S. :-)<br /><br />But getting back to the movie, this is a rivetting and suspenseful, if somewhat grisly flick with an interesting plot and premise that is worth renting if you didn't see it in the theater. Freeman, Pitt, and Spacey are excellent in the lead roles, and the movie stands as much on the strength of their performances as on the shock value of the serial killer concept.value of the serial killer concept.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|'Slick - restrained - off - emo - of vomit and urine(?) - not as epic - a stinker(??) - brilliant - disappointing...' <br /> <br />So far, this is what is mentioned (dominantly) after reading half of all 91 customer reviews. ( Take note that I am not insane nor extremely bored - I enjoyed looking at the different perspectives ) And what I can conclude about the reading is this: <br /> <br />Do not contain Death Cab. And, in fact, yourself. Truly, once any guy/girl has decided to do so, you can only feel ecstatic. <br /> <br />Yes, I agree that Plans strokes (\\"Soul Meets Body,\\" \\"Stable Song\\" ) and also [rather harshly] pokes (\\"What Sarah Said,\\" \\"Summer Skin\\") the heart, rather than clench and beat it (as I've heard Transatlanticism may or may not do - depends).  <br /> <br />And I say for myself that Plans can achieve elation, too. Take 'Crooked Teeth' and 'Brothers on a Hotel Bed,' for instance. I agree with all of this, as well as that they've decided to experiment and (pretty much) made a contrast to Airplanes. <br /> <br />But, since I have to conclude, one must ask: good or what? I say, listen to it (multiple times, even) and see for yourself. C=
B0009A40ES|5.0|I remember when \\"American Psycho\\" came out on DVD.  I was in fourth grade, and not a huge fan of horror movies.  I instantly decided that I would never watch the film, because it looked like a stupid slasher flick.  Then, a few months ago, I saw Christian Bale in \\"Batman Begins\\" and thought he was fantastic.  I looked up \\"American Psycho\\" on the IMDb and it was rated pretty high.  So I thought, what the hey, I'll give it a try. <br /> <br />I'm mighty glad that I did. <br /> <br />\\"American Psycho\\" is set in New York in 1987.  It revolves around Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), a very successful lawyer who may be getting married to Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon), is having an affair with Courtney (Samantha Mathis), and is the object of his secretary's (Chloe Sevigny) affections.  But unbeknownst to his so-called \\"friends\\" and co-workers, Patrick is a killer who strikes almost at random.  And now a clever detective (Willem Dafoe) is investigating the murder of one of Patrick's victims.  Will Patrick get caught? <br /> <br />The film is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' bestselling novel, which caused quite a controversy when it was first released.  \\"American Psycho\\" the film, like the book, is about two things: one, Patrick Bateman and the murders; and two, the self-absorbed society of the 80's.  Because it's set in the 80's, it has a great soundtrack, and it makes the movie much more fun. <br /> <br />Mary Harron's directing is wonderful.  During daytime scenes, the film seems bright and shiny, almost as though it were an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.  Then there's the nighttime scenes - dark, grim, with a texture like charcoal.  Harron enhances the film immensely. <br /> <br />Without a doubt, the highlight of the film is Christian Bale.  Bale's performance in this film is one of the greatest I have ever seen in my life.  He BECOMES the character.  It blew me away.  He can be mean, angry, suave, and damn funny.  The rest of the cast is good, but Bale is absolutely spectacular. <br /> <br />While I can't recommend this film to everybody, I would suggest that if you don't mind the occasional blood and are looking for a humorous film, pick this one up.  Entertaining, dramatic, absorbing, funny, well-made, and with a terrific ending.  \\"American Psycho\\" is without a doubt one of the year's best.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I think he has a great voice, and the music back him up well.  I didn't love all the songs, but it is nice peaceful music to work with in the background.
B00007FOMP|5.0|And that comes from a metalhead who generally prefers bands like Iron Maiden or Metallica. But I try to expand a bit into other genres, and i'm happy I do so, because otherwise, I never would have heard what I consider to be one of the best albums ever made - \\"What's Going On\\", by soul legend Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br />I was persuaded to buy the album after hearing the title track on the radio one day. Yes, it's that good, and the rest of the album is just as awesome. Gaye is one of the best singers to ever grace the Earth with his presence, and his incredible talent to pour out his soul without seeming even remotely campy is showcased here. The sheer emotion of this album is mind-blowing, and I doubt that ANYONE else could have pulled it off. <br /> <br />The main theme of this album is simple - peace. Love, peace, and hope for the future. Naive, you say? No, you wouldn't understand unless you've actually listened to the album, all the way through. And I don't mean \\"put it on while you chat on AIM\\" or something like that - as an earlier reviewer said, LISTEN to it! Gaye's message was so simple, and yet so many people don't get it. <br /> <br />What else is there to say? This is one of those classic albums that comes along only once or twice in a generation, and will never lose its relevance. Highly recommended for ANYONE, no matter what genres of music you listen to.
B000002IAS|5.0|There are a few opportunities that Eric Clapton has afforded himself to be a part of another's band. This is because he has a reputation for being a kind of one man show. Delaney and Bonnie is the exception to the case. You don't really get too much soloing or grandstanding and Eric seems to fit right into the the band seemlessly. I think that there was a little respect on Eric's part for the musical integrity of this band and the humility works out well, a stellar work of r&b by Delanie an Bonnie.
B00004THAY|5.0|Is an excellent \\"Blues\\" song. All songs are long jams by the best in the business.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|The lives of people can be complicated, but it all boils down to the truth of love. It speaks to conveninces in realtionships and if people are prepared to fight for what they want. Natalie Portman's performance was outstanding as she blended in well with her role, which made the fil even more believable.
B000025ABR|4.0|There is no doubting the great quality of Celine Dion's voice.  She also has the ability to pick the right songs that suit her inimitable style.  This album is well mastered and the sound quality is quite good.  She even does duets with acts as diverse as the Bee Gees and Pavarotti but the big international love song from the Titanic is here which I suppose alone would be responsible for selling truckloads of this cd.  A competent, feelgood disc, nothing to shout about but nothing to sneeze at as well.  If you are a Celine fan, then you will enjoy this.
0395389496|5.0|I am a teacher of Grade 3 children and have read this book to my class at Christmas since it first came out. Children have been enthralled at the story and the magical illustrations, and to top it all off, I jingle an antique sleigh bell when reading the final pages! It presents a wonderful story of Christmas which will not offend any religious groups.
B000000OAH|4.0|This is a good album and many great tracks are on this like \\"Bicycle Race\\" and \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" but it somehow isn't as good as its predecessor, \\"News of the World\\" or it's successor \\"The Game\\".  Still, even mediocre Queen is better than most band's best efforts and that's not to say that this album is in any way mediocre.  The tracks don't flow as well as other Queen efforts but this is still a cd worth getting.  The disc has been remastered quite well and sounds quite good and it has 2 bonus remix tracks at the end.  Recommended.
B000B19BCG|4.0|While this album won't slap you in the face, much like previous Supergrass efforts, the lush soundscapes created on this record will definitely please. Sure, there aren't any blatant silly pop rock songs, but you won't care by the end of this album. <br /> <br />With the grand numbers like \\"Tales of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6)\\" and \\"Roxy\\", you'll be entranced by the silky strings and the jangly guitars. The slower ones, like \\"St. Petersburg\\" and \\"Sad Girl\\" are far more subdued, but have a sort of ethereal beauty to them. They also have some impressive vocal work (which is consistent through out the album). <br /> <br />\\"Road to Rouen\\" and \\"Kick in the Teeth\\" are minor dance stompers that show you the band can still get you moving. The guitar work is especially impressive on those two. The instrumental \\"Coffee in the Pot\\" is an interesting tune, and pretty damn catchy. Very reminiscent of the band's early work. <br /> <br />The album ends with the one-two punch of \\"Low C\\" and \\"Fin\\", which help put a finish to a focused and mature album from a band that needed one in this part of their career. <br /> <br />Overall, dedicated fans of the band will love it, casual listeners of their old material might not, and new ears might appreciate the band's ability to fuse guitar pop and grandiose soundscapes.  <br /> <br />Though not instantly catchy in any sense, this is an unexpected but thoroughly entertaining and solid release.
B000000OAC|5.0|This is one of Queen's best albums as all the tracks are great and have a great flow.  The recordings have been remastered and so sound good as well.  The bonus track is a remixed version of \\"We Will Rock You\\" which is a nice touch.  Some very good ballads like \\"It's Late\\" and \\"Spread Your Wings\\" provide a nice contrast to the rockers like \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\".  A very good balance of hard and soft tunes with the usual eccentric Freddie Mercury contributions make this a worthy addition to any music lover's collection.  Recommended.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The cd is just a flat out classic.<br /><br />I own every cd pac released while alive and this one, and The 7 Day Theory is my favorite of them all. This is a cd that you can easily play from start to finish without skipping any tracks. The album starts out strong with 3 classics: Hail Mary, Toss It Up, and To Live & Die in L.A. Then goes into a mix of social and fun songs, and finishes off with some political songs and a strong ending that compliments the intro.<br /><br />The worst part of this album, imo, is this stupid part in the song Me and My Girlfriend when you hear this girl shooting a gun yelling out things, just lame, but only a short part.<br /><br />The Tracks.<br /><br />1. Bomb First (Intro): 10/10 - Great intro, sets the stage.<br />2. Hail Mary: 10/10 - Classic<br />3. Toss It Up: 10/10 - Classic<br />4. To Live & Die in L.A.: 10/10 - Classic<br />5. Blasphemy: 10/10 - M.O.B. (I like the following part lol)<br />\\"They say Moses split the Red Sea<br />I split the blunt and rolled the fat one, I'm deadly\\"<br />6. Life Of a New Outlaw: 9.5/10 - Good song<br />7. Just Like Daddy: 9.5/10 - Another good song<br />8. Krazy: 10/10 - I really like this song. This song is definitely in my top 5 favorite 2pac songs.<br />9. White Man'z World: 9/10 - Pretty good song<br />10. Me and My Girlfriend: 9/10 - Silly part that is annoying forced a 9 here.<br />11. Hold ya Head: 10/10 - Another one of my favorites<br />12. Against All Odds: 9.5/10 - Good song that finishes off the mood started in the intro, great way to end this cd imo.
B000000OAN|5.0|This has got to be among the top 10 rock albums of all time and definitely Queen's best even if not the most popular or hit filled.  For a 1991 remastered album, the sound quality is very good too.  There are 3 bonus tracks which do not detract from the main content and which means you get more bang for your buck.<br /><br />Everyone knows about \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" but don't forget other greats like \\"You're My Best Friend\\", \\"'39\\" a great track to play along to but you need a capo, \\"Love of My Life\\" and in true Jimi Hendrix tribute style, \\"God Save the Queen\\", the British national anthem rock style, previously never done before.<br /><br />The whole album is a work of art and has to be listened to at one sitting.  The tracks flow along together very smoothly as it tells its story.  A must have for any music collector.  I can't wait for my Japanese mini-lp sleeve 2001 remastered version to arrive soon to hear the difference.  Hard act to follow to improve upon the great sound of this disc already but I'll let you know when I review it after I get a chance to hear it.  Highly recommended!
B00005JMXX|1.0|Very very funny, unbelievably stupid. Eight year olds in the theater were gleefully pointing out some of the more entertainingly insipid \\"science\\". I've read that Gore tried to promote the movie in order to encourage public discussion about the very serious problems that he claims we face from the threat of global warming. (17-year-old Hollywood newcomer Emmy Rossum may attract more attention from Gore's ex-boss.) Honestly, if anyone ever brings up \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" in order to launch into a serious conversation about the environment, you'll know you're in the company of a moron. <br /> <br />OK, say it again: Thank God for Florida.
0316172324|2.0|If you've read the Tipping Point, you might be disappointed by Blink. I'm not sure what happened between the two, but Blink is very hard to read and not as interesting as the Tipping Point. Being a self proclaimed \\"Maven\\", I was telling everyone about the Tipping Point. While I wouldn't bad mouth Mr. Gladwell, I tell people it's not as good as the Tipping Point, which, by the way, is a MUST read...
B0006J28MI|2.0|It's 1994, but for Macaulay Culkin's film career, it's a minute before midnight and the Governor won't be calling. Culkin's capital offense is the moronic Richie Rich. While the writing and directing help put this kidpic flat on the mat, it's Culkin's presence that beats it senseless. If you've got any compassion, you can only hope that Culkin's father didn't put all the money into internet stocks.    Richie Rich teaches us two lessons: 1) having 70 billion dollars is meaningless if you don't have friends and 2) having 70 billion dollars puts you in a pretty good position to get friends once you've learned Lesson 1. The message is: rich or poor, it's better to have money. This is, of course, a variant on the message kids got a couple of years ago from Beauty And The Beast-- namely, that outward appearances count for absolutely nothing, but since you've got to have one, it might as well be really buff.    Richie, the eponymous protagonist rendered unwatchable by Culkin, is, of course, the richest kid in the world, a Lucky Sperm Club Founding Member born of parents whose net worth totals the aforementioned outsize wad. Growing up, Richie gets the best of everything: aerobics classes with Claudia Schiffer, batting lessons from Reggie Jackson, and a private Air Force at his disposal that could kick, say, Italy's ass. He's even got his own Disney-sized amusement park and a McDonald's in his basement.    But is he happy? Of course not. What he really wants is to hang out with the scruffy, street-smart kids (one black, one white, one Hispanic, one Asian, one handicapped Native American jewish lesbian etc.) who play ball in the vacant lot next to the tool factory owned by his dad's company. The scruffy kids, though, want nothing to do with a child of privilege, or at least not one who wears a quart of Valvoline in his hair.  Richie's butler, who tempers his stiff British propriety with the emotional radar of a Seemingly Stiff British Butler Who Really Has A Big Heart, senses his young charge's longings and arranges for the scruffy kids to spend a day chez Rich. And at the end of the day, whaddaya know! They like Richie because of who he is, not because of what he has. They like him in spite of his world-class rollercoaster, not because of it---although they're not exactly begging Richie to come to their place for the next play date.    The rest of the insipid plot has Dad's evil lieutenant planning to blow up the Riches' private jet with them on it and sell the run-down tool factory, which is somehow the crown jewel in a 70 billion (with a \\"b\\") dollar empire. Young Richie spoils the fun by unexpectedly getting off the plane prior to takeoff. When his parents are assumed to be missing or dead, he takes control of the empire, which involves saving the tool factory, hiring all the scruffy kids, and getting his face on the front cover of every national magazine. Of course, Mom and Dad have miraculously survived the explosion with only some minor bruises and fractures. That leaves them in considerably better shape than the audience, which files a 70 billion dollar class action lawsuit against the producers charging reckless assault on intelligence. Count me in.
B00005U2LM|3.0|I see alot of you giving this album 5 stars but when you look at previous works by the WU such as TICAL and ENTER THE 36 CHAMBERS this mostly mediocre album cant even begin to compare. Dont get me wrong there are about 5 good tracks but really when you pick up a 13 song album and only 5 of the songs are good it leaves alot to be desired I think the main thing this CD suffers from is poor production  as displayed on tracks like \\"In The Hood,\\"  and the track with Public Enemy as well as various others you may be looking at some of these 5 star reviews and start thinking Hmmm could this be the return of the 36 CHAMBERS. H--L no its not this has to be the worst WU tang album I have ever heard and believe me I am one of the biggest WU fans that ever was. I am going to be generous and give this three stars but this is a solidly mediocre album. Those of you out there who are hatin on me for givin this a 3 stars need to get a life. So what I gave it a decent review and its just as much my right to give a CD 3 stars as it is your right to give it 5 stars thats what a  REVIEW is its an opinion voiced by an individual (like me) who has a right to think the way he wants to regardless of what other people think thats what the first amendment is all about. If you dont own any Wu albums skip this and pick up TICAL or ENTER THE 36 CHAMBERS
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth's fifth album, released in 2001, is considered by many fans to be their best. And \\"Blackwater Park\\" is also a bit different from other Opeth albums, because, even though it incorporates Opeth's famous progressive rock alongside some heavier songs, it doesn't quite have the death metal influence of some of Opeth's other albums, like \\"My Arms, Your Hearse,\\" or 2002's \\"Deliverance.\\" Other than that, however, every ingredient is here for a great Opeth album (death metal growls, lots of breakdowns, acoustic guitar strums, long songs, etc.) The album opener, \\"The Leper Affinity,\\" is around ten minutes long, and features a propulsive main riff, mean, death metal vocals, and two breakdowns (the first of which is an acoustic breakdown; the second one has some cool piano playing). Next, \\"Bleak,\\" a Mediterranean-esque song with guest vocals by Porcupine Tree's Steve Wilson, is mostly heavy (with heavy riffs and bellows); but part of this song is occupied by light, eloquent guitar strings and singing. Elsewhere, \\"Harvest\\" is a pretty, acoustic driven semi-ballad, and \\"The Drapery Falls\\" puts more light, acoustic strums alongside dreary, harmonic vocals, but also some staccato, electric guitar riffs. \\"The Dirge For November\\" is cut into two pieces: the second half is heavy, but the first half is so light and restrained, you can actually hear Mikael breathe in. Next, \\"Funeral Portrait\\" rockets into pounding riffs, and \\"Patterns In The Ivy\\" is an instrumental, acoustic and piano ballad which is as beautiful as it is docile. Finally, with fast, propulsive riffs, the album ending title track (a personal favorite of mine) returns Opeth to their heavier, death metal roots. And if you get the limited edition version of this C.D., you get a bonus track, \\"Still Day Beneath the Sun,\\" which is also required listening for all Opeth diehards. So, even though this may not be as heavy as some of this band's other works, \\"Blackwater Park\\" is still a wonderful album, and definitely Opeth's first or second best. I very strongly recommend it to all music fans.first or second best. I very strongly recommend it to all music fans.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is classic pop for 2005.  It starts up right where Postal Service ended.  Good music.  No thinking.  Just listen and enjoy. <br /> <br />Too many people overanalyze the music today.  This is just feel-good music without thought.  Believe it's true.
B000002HMH|4.0|I firmly believe this album was not a sell-out. Granted, \\"Load\\" does have an alternative sound, so it appeals to more of the general population (people who didn't like Metallica's earlier, heavy, thrash-y albums), but I think Metallica entered the mainstream years before this C.D.'s release. Many fans think 1991's self-titled album (\\"The Black Album\\") was their first mainstream move, but I disagree; I think 1988's \\"...And Justice For All\\" was their first attempt at becoming more popular. After all, following the release of that album, Metallica recorded their first music video (for the song \\"One\\"). Plus, look at \\"Master of Puppets\\"-that album almost single-handedly bridged the metal-mainstream gap.<br /><br />Instead of selling out, I think Metallica experimented. This new, experimental sound alienated a number of their fans, but I think Metallica were forced to make an album like \\"Load,\\" because they had to evolve and change their sound. It's what bands do; it's how the listener is able to discern between albums! And even though they lost some fans, \\"Load\\" also helped the band tell who their true, faithful fans were.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong; this album isn't perfect. At 78 plus minutes, it's kind of long and drags on a bit. Plus, some of the songs (i.e. the album's first ballad, \\"The House That Jack Built\\" and the album closer, \\"The Outlaw Torn\\") are boring and rather forgettable.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is NOT a bad album. The wisely chosen, up-tempo single \\"Ain't My B -tch,\\" the bluesy \\"2 X 4,\\" \\"Until It Sleeps,\\" and \\"King Nothing\\"are all quite catchy. Plus, \\"Until It Sleeps\\" kind of sounds like a \\"Black Album\\" b-side and \\"King Nothing\\" has a nice Hammett solo. Other standout tracks are \\"Bleeding Me\\" (which, even though is an overly long song, gradually gains momentum and has another cool guitar solo), \\"Mama Said\\" (which is a ballad with soft, acoustic strumming), \\"Wasting My Hate\\" and \\"Thorn Within\\" are like the first track because they have semi-heavy riffs, and the opening part of \\"Ronnie\\" is a worthy of a toe-tapping.<br /><br />If you think \\"Load\\" marked the end of Metallica, then you're not a true fan. This isn't Metallica's best work, but it's really not half bad. It's a must own for all of Metallica's real fans (it's not for you if you're just a fan of `80's thrash), and if you give it a fair shot, you should like this album quite a bit.hey have semi-heavy riffs, and the opening part of \\"Ronnie\\" is a worthy of a toe-tapping.  <br /> <br />If you think \\"Load\\" marked the end of Metallica, then you're not a true fan.

B000088E6D|5.0|I have to say this is one great CD. Seeing Michael in concert recently added to my opinion that the man is the best modern day crooner out there. Young powerful voice on some great old classics. If you like swing jazz, you will love this CD.
B000002HRE|4.0|Releasing \\"Reload,\\" a collection of b-sides from 1996's \\"Load,\\" was a pretty brave move by Metallica, considering \\"Load\\" met with a pretty lukewarm response. But Metallica had five years to make \\"Load,\\" so it makes sense that they had a bunch of unused songs which they wanted heard.<br /><br />Some songs, like the explosive album opener \\"Fuel,\\" are still full of energy and vitriol, but most of \\"Reload\\" continues down the path that Metallica started with that 1996 album. This new stripped down, laid back sound intermixes ballads and half speed tempos with bluesy and even country-esque songs. Songs such as \\"The Unforgiven II\\" are predictable, go no where power ballads, making you miss the fiery, rip-roaring riffs of old.  But other moments, like the female backing vocals on \\"The Memory Remains,\\" \\"Prince Charming\\" (which has a nice, wah-wah Hammett solo), and the violin on \\"Low Man's Lyric\\" spice things up a bit and make \\"Reload\\" less boring.<br /><br />I think the aforementioned \\"Fuel\\" is, hands down, the best track on the record, but some songs (like \\"The Memory Remains\\" and the rhythmic \\"Devil's Dance\\") are catchy, even though they aren't very fast. And the multi-layered \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" sounds somewhat odd and creepy, and has two nice guitar solos (the first of which is probably the best on the album). Other highlights include the catchy, churning rhythm of \\"Slither,\\" and \\"Attitude,\\" which rocks more profusely than most of the other songs.<br /><br />All in all, like its 1996 predecessor, \\"Reload\\" gets a 7 out of 10 on the good album scale. It's definitely not Metallica's best, catchiest, or hardest rocking effort. But you could argue it is among their most mature album, and it is a \\"stepping stone\\" in the evolution of this band. The bottom line is, \\"Reload\\" is about as good as \\"Load,\\" and if you don't like one you won't like the other. But they are both definitely worth a listen, and they're both essential in every real Metallica fan's collection.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|This film was definitely a surprise to me and my friends. When I first saw the trailer promos for this movie, I didn't think it would be worth seeing in the theater, and I LOVE martial arts flicks. The title alone was dumb enough, but the promotors for this movie in American theaters should be fired out of a cannon. I waited until the DVD version of Kung Fu Hustle came out. My friends, (some of whom never even heard of the film), and I watched the DVD version and we were completely blown away. Kung Fu Hustle is not the cheesy, campy, cartoon like martial arts flick that it was promoted to be in the U.S. Yes, there were some comedic moments in the film, and even some subtle tributes to other martial arts/action films, but this movie was so much more than that. If you like martial arts/action/fantasy genres, then Kung Fu Hustle will definitely not disappoint you.
B00005JO0J|5.0|In 1999, I walked out of \\"The Phantom Menace\\", pissed off & feeling betrayed by George Lucas; been that way ever since.<br /><br />Today, I exited \\"Serenity\\" with my faith in sci-fi cinema restored.<br /><br />Blessed be Joss Whedon.<br /><br />Amen.
B000AXSN5G|2.0|Neil Young is a Talented Songwriter&Musician,but he has a tendency to release alot of so-so Projects from time to time&this is no exception. the lyrical Content&the overall Musical Feel here is very much on the safe territory that Eric Clapton long ago settled for.it can work for some artists,but it makes some others seem in need of trying to just release whatever as soon as Possible.very run of the mill Album here.
0792164903|4.0|In an era when \\"Horror Movie\\" usually means mindless slasher films of exceeding visual ugliness and moral repugnance, \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is a welcome return to the classic gothic chillers of the past; visually elegant and beautiful (Like all Tim Burton movies), spooky, funny, scary and intelligent. The casting of Christopher Lee and Michael Gough (Who co-starred in Hammer's \\"Horror of Dracula\\" back in 1958) along with a host of top British actors (Including Ian MacDairmid, the Evil Emperor Palpatine of the \\"Star Wars\\" movies) give it the flavor of a classic Hammer film, while Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci and Casper Van Diem bring youth and beauty to the cast. Depp is hilarious, and Miranda Richardson and Christopher Walken add sinister icing on this Halloween cake. A terrific movie, here served with a Tim Burton commentary track. But be aware, this is not Washington Irving's famous ghost story, but rather an original story using some of Irving's character names and situations, but with a whole new plotline (A whodunit with a ghost and witchcraft), and Depp's funny take on Icabod Crane bears no resemblence to Irving's skinny schoolteacher original. But we've all seen Irving's story already, so this new tale is welcome indeed
B0007MWZEK|2.0|Please save your money. I purchased mine after reading a glowing review.   This items is cheaply made and will not stand up.  I paid $70.CAD  plus shipping and taxes and will send it back.  It does not live up to it's powerful billing.  Dust and cat hair just get blown around.  The canister holds next to nothing.  The two mini sweepers are just a joke.  There must be better products for the money.  On the plus side it is small and easy to manuever and better on carpets than hardwood.  The cons outway any pros.
0805079076|5.0|I have no linguistic training and I am effectively monolingual, so I cannot comment on the scholarship. But in terms of delivery this is the best \\"lay\\" technical book I have ever read. The pace is consistent and accessible, the content seemed to be tailored directly to my pedestrian curiosities, and the style was fluent and witty. Since other reviewers have remarked on this, I would say that the author's wit is only annoying insofar as I don't have it (at me there is none of it).

B000007T2Z|4.0|It is hard to say anything about this album that has not already been said a dozen times, but some things are worth repetition. <br /> <br />This album was my first exposure to Godspeed You! Black Emperor (referred to from now on as GY!BE), and I really had no idea what to expect. The monologue at the beginning of the first track immediately grabs your attention and says one thing very, very clearly: \\"This is NOT just another record. I have something to say, and you're going to listen.\\" <br /> <br />GY!BE don't make music, in the traditional sense of the word. They are landscape artists, but instead of paint and brushes, they use guitars and drums (and a surprisingly varied assortment of other instruments) to do their creating. <br /> <br />The message is clearly not a hopeful one. \\"We are trapped in the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death\\" the old man laments at the beginning of the record. This is, as has been said before, the soundtrack to the end of the world. <br /> <br />As trite as it sounds, the image of London presented in 28 days later while east Hastings is playing is an almost perfect representation of the soundscape that GY!BE create in this album. To listen to this album is to feel the despair of one knowing nothing will ever be whole again.  <br /> <br />Somehow, GY!BE have managed to create this horrible image and still have it be beautiful. The music itself is a thing of beauty, the message it conveys is one of ultimate despair. There is something magical in the dichotomy, and I doubt it could be pulled off by any band without a true gift for music. <br /> <br />Also striking on this album are the pauses, which seem to go on interminably, especially on the last track. But somehow, just when it's gotten to the point when the silence has started to annoy you, music comes back in, flooding your newly virginized ears with its wonder. <br /> <br />To me, there is a sound in that silence, but it can only be heard if one listens painstakingly closely. It is a sound heard all too infrequently in the past few years. That sound, my friends, is talent...and I think we could all use to hear a bit more of that.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Having a brother who is very much like Joon, I could relate to the movie first hand. All these people want is a REAL life and to live each day as best they can like anyone else. They want what most people want...to love and be loved. Beening faced with the decision of weather or not to put my brother in a \\"group home\\" the movie hit a tender spot in my heart.The movie was even toned, not to much comedy and not to much on the sometimes darker side of living with a person with this illness.My 15 year old loved the movie and proclaims it to be one of her favorites.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I am a rather new Dream Theater fan, so I can't comment knowledgeably on song selection. However, I do watch a lot of concert video, and I can assure you this is among the best. Not only is the musical performance superb, but the video direction and editing are outstanding. There are plenty of shots of all these great musicians, displaying their splendid technique in detail. There are no distracting visual effects, voiceovers, or intercut interviews that have ruined so many other concert videos. You're basically watching a live concert, just as you would in real life, except you get a much better view (and a crisper audio mix) than you could in the auditorium. <br /> <br />The Dolby Digital sound is top-notch. The only shortcoming is that John Myung's intricate bass work is too far down in the mix, often inaudible beneath Mike Portnoy's thundering dual kick drum. I found that turning down the subwoofer a bit was helpful in attentuating that kick drum and bringing out Myung's bass. I will give the director and editor credit for giving us many lengthy shots of Myung's playing; typically, bass players are given the short shrift on screen time. <br /> <br />Dream Theater is a band for discriminating musicians, and this live concert DVD will not disappoint even that picky audience.
B0000024TT|5.0|Leonard Cohen's first album is an amazing set of songs that will forever remain on the shortlist of classic 60's folk albums. Bitter the songs are, but they are injected with such emotion and clear expression it reminds one what it means to be alive. Desolation and want are two of the strongest feelings human beings have. And even though they aren't fun, we all need them to survive. This is what makes the just shy of 40 minutes \\"The Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" such a beautiful experience. Even though it doesn't champion human strength (it surely would have weakened it's impact) It is certainly something beautiful to see and hear through his eyes and melodies, even when the pain and suffering is at it's deepest.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Celtic music has roots deep in the oral and musical traditions of the British Isles, Ireland most significantly. For centuries, it has thrived at gatherings, celebrations, and in pubs, preserving local legend and history through lyrical story-telling. This music has strong traditions in short, lyrical songs, accompanied by fiddle, tin whistle, guitar, Ulieann pipes, and the Celtic drum, the bodhran.<br /><br />Vocalists Chloe Agnew, Lisa Kelly, Moav Ni Mhatolchatha, and Orla Fallon, (vocals, harp), along with violinist Moiroad Nesbitt, are the Celtic women of this extraordinary album's title. Each of them have recorded individually. They give enchanting, romantic, old Irish ballads and airs a mystical New Age spin, with influences from the classical, and come up with a unique sound, performing solo and  together in ensemble pieces. \\"Celtic Woman\\" clearly portrays the individual delivery and style of each performer. Their pure, clear voices also meld hauntingly, evoking another time and place, now gone forever except in their songs.<br /><br />I love the entire CD, great music selections - but some of my favorite cuts are the classic \\"Danny Boy,\\" \\"Harry's Game,\\" (Orla sings this - extraordinary), made famous by the Clannad, and \\"Last Rose of Summer/Walking in the Air,\\" performed by Chloe, which is simply ethereal - gorgeous. If you don't get up to dance with \\"Si Do Mhaimeo,\\" (The Wealthy Widow) a spirited, playful tune, then you surely will when the fiddler plays \\"The Butterfly.\\" You'll want your feet to fly.<br /><br />Accompanying the Celtic Women are musicians Desi Moore (guitar), Martin Johnston (cello), David Downes (whistle, harpsichord, keyboards), John O`Brien (Uilleann pipe), Eoghan O`Neill (bass guitar), Robbie Casserly (percussion).<br /><br />\\"Celtic Woman\\" was created by Sharon Browne, Dave Kavanaugh (founders of Ireland's successful Celtic Collections label), and music producer/composer/conductor David Downes. The successful launching of the group is the realization of their collective dream. Downes, who was heavily involved with the American production of \\"Riverdance, wanted to bring these five extremely talented women to the public's notice. This hour long compilation of modern and classic Irish songs is the group's first album and one that showcases the glorious Irish musical heritage. Bravo!<br />JANAtive dream.

B000060K4O|5.0|I loved the movie as a child and even watched the cartoon that somehow turned Slimer into a good guy. Looking back, it ruins the continuity, but luckily as a little kid I didn't care. I even enjoyed the widely panned sequel, yeah it wasn't as good as the original, but it is still funnier than much of what Hollywood releases today. Not to mention the numerous memorabilia such as bed sheets, lunch box, and action figures. <br /> <br />The movie also introduced me to the comic geniuses that are Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis. Keep in mind that Saturday Night Live, Caddyshack and previous movies they were in were before my time or were in movies that my parents wouldn't let me see at the time. Murray plays Dr. Peter Venkman, the reluctant leader of the group who would rather pick up some hot chick than further his science career. Aykroyd is Dr. Raymond Stantz, the naive one of the group who enjoys his work a little too much. And Ramis, the perennial straightman, plays Dr. Egon Spengler. All of them hit each joke perfectly. <br /> <br />In addition to the main cast, the supporters are just as perfect. First is the scene stealer, Rick Moranis as an accountant turned Keymaster. Sigourney Weaver, who did look good back then but the frizzy hair hasn't aged well, is Venkman's love interest turned Gatekeeper. Then there are Annie Potts as the token New Yorker secretary and Ernie Hudson, the only ghostbuster without a Dr. in his name that keeps the group grounded and keeps thing in perspective from a regular guy's point of view. <br /> <br />The movie itself maybe not be as quote worthy as other 80's classics and some of the CG has not stood the test of time (where George Lucas when you need him) but the movie as a whole is still worth watching especially with Halloween coming up. So fire up the DVD and let the Ray Parker Jr. blare (which I don't think sounds anything like Huey Lewis' I Want a New Drug). And don't forget to roast some Staypuft Marshmallows over thefire.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This was one of the most clever, funny movies I have ever seen.  The characters were real, stupid, clever, and on the mark comics.  There were actually scary moments and frights.  We all know someone like at least one of these characters.<br /><br />When Shaun and his friend were thinking of plans to save his mother and the thoughts of them running out of the house hand in hand with his mother made me cry laughing.  And when they decieded that the zombies were not very bright and the characters decided to act like zombies in order to fool them was a riot.  And that was just 2 of the many hilarious moments.  This is keeper and a classic!
1878424319|5.0|I read this book back when it was first released and it was interesting to me then.....I even wrote the four agreements out and had them on my refridge door for months.  The whole idea appealed and was what I wished for in my life but things took me away from the whole theory.  I had them in the back of my mind and when I ran across my list from my refridge recently I decided to read the book again. This time it really hit home and seemed so easy to read and feel \\"I CAN DO THIS!\\" that I feel so positive and have since read another follow up book, The Voice Of Knowledge, which cements the whole theory of living to the best of life, believing in ourselves and listening to our own voice, heart and feel what is in our own soul and spirit.  Be the best we can and then we can be good for others........I would love for everyone to read this book over and over again until we all get it and can apply the four agreements to our daily lives. What a better world we would be......I plan to reread it again soon and I hope it says even more to me the third time!!!!

B00005JO0J|4.0|Serenity is a slap in the face to those morons who canceled the show. FOX canceled someone of their best shows like Fastlane, Tru Calling, Futurama, Family Guy and Firefly. They were even dumb enough to cancel Fastlane with a cliffhanger ending and I'm still want to know what happened next. Anyway both Family Guy and Firely got  second chances. Family Guy is back on FOX and Firefly creator Joss Whedon brought his vision back to life on the big screen.<br /><br />  I just got into Firefly with the dvd's and sci-fi channel showing re-runs and I don't why I never watched it. It's great fun, with smart dialogue and a nice science fiction/western combination. Whedon does a fine job bringing all that to the big screen. With some better special effects and  more ruthless villians. The actors are up to the challenge too since most of them have been on the big screen before. This movie though will probably get them more starring roles. Nathan Fillion \\"the evil and strong priest in the last season of Buffy\\" is awesome as Mal, the captain of Firefly. The guy can deliver witty lines well but when  he has to show off the character's dark self-cenered side he's even better. Adam Baldwin (My Bodyguard, Full Metal Jacket, Angel's last season) is equally good as the unpredictable Jayne. You never know what he's gonna say or do.<br /><br />  Gina Torres \\"who Whedon also used as a powerful villian in Angel season 4\\" is great just like she was in the show. She plays Mal's trusted alley who fought in a war with him. She'd follow him anywhere, especially since her husband's the pilot of Serenity. The sexy Summer Glau almost steals the show as River. A psychic who was also turnt into a weapon by scientists. Her being on the ship is a danger to Serenity and it's members since she's wanted all over the galaxy. That was the plot in the show too but it also works in the movie since we never got to learn much about her before the show was canceled. Here Serenity and anyone who has helped it's crew is in threat by a dangerous member of the alliance. He wants River and he won't stop killing until he gets her. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Four Brothers) is a badass and even scary as the bounty hunter.<br /><br />  What makes the movie more unpredictable than the show is that since it's no longer a show, it doesn't matter to Whedon if he kills anyone off. Which helps keep the viewers at the edge of their seats. You have to admire Whedon for not giving up on his vision and going back to it even after the show got canceled. Even if this doesn't get FOX to put the show back on, hopefully we'll still get more movies. Also hopefully Joss has a Angel movie planned for us fans who are still mad at WB for canceling it.crew is in threat by a dangerous member of the alliance.

B00005JNEI|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever. It shows vividly how fragile the line between \\"freedom\\" and \\"tyrany\\" is (to quote Bush's best loved terms). Who has freedom? Who is the tyrant? Does the US Patriot Act protect the freedom of ordinary Americans? Why did the Bush go against the majority of the UN to go into Iraq? Why do so many Americans still believe the infamous \\"Weapons of Mass Destruction\\" will still be found? Why do so many Americans still blindly follow a man like Bush, who most people outside the US despise (yes, including myself)? <br /> <br />Michael Moore shows Bush at his worst, and shows why its so good not to be an American right now. <br /> <br />The really scary thing about this movie is to read all the 1-star reviews here on Amazon. How can so many people be so blind to the truth? America is definately a great nation. What a pity it has evolved into what it is now.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|First Blood is an outstanding movie. It is about a vietnam veteran green beret named John Rambo who is played by Sylvester Stallone. After recurring nightmares and post-traumatic stress from war memories as a prisoner of war in vietnam, Rambo comes back to the states into the pacific northwest in search of a new life. He tries to contact an old war buddy only to find out that his friend has died of cancer. After a walk into town, Rambo is greeted by Sheriff Will Teasle who offers to give Rambo a lift out of town on the promise that he does not return. Rambo asks for where he can get a bite to eat, and the sheriff says that he can find a diner about 30 miles up the highway. <br /> <br />Rambo asks Teasle, \\"Why are you pushing me? I haven't done anything to you.\\" Teasle says, \\"We don't want guys like you in this town. First thing you know, we got a bunch of guys like you in this town. That's why.\\" After being driven to Teasles drop off point, Rambo decides to challenge him and starts walking back into town. Teasle arrests Rambo and charges him with vagrancy, resisting arrest, and carrying a concealed weapon. After some torturous experiences in the jail cell (only meant to clean him up), Rambo has a major flashback to the Vietnam war and goes berzerk. <br /> <br />He busts out of the joint, tears a guy off of his dirtbike and heads up into the mountains ensuing a huge chase involving the sheriff's posse, a helicopter, search dogs, and the national guard. There are some very interesting twists and turns to the plots as you never know what will happen from one minute to the next. The scene where he jumps off the cliff into some trees, cuts open an arm on a branch, and stitches his arm up is one of the best scenes and most memorable... Ouch!  <br /> <br />The climactic scene is great because in the end, Rambo breaks down and becomes an innocent fragile child explaining how he was mistreated by citizens as he returned to the states, having his friend get blown to bits in front of him in Saigon, all of the bad things that happened to him. He should have gotten an oscar for his performance in that scene because his breakdown was pretty heroic and gutsy. Overall, a very good movie with regard to how a lot of vets feel after they return from a war and dealing with psychological issues because of... I highly recommened it.
B000002LRX|5.0|Leave it to the Mike Patton era Faith No More to strike a chord in the mainstream, and then give it the big middle finger.  I absolutely loved The Real Thing, and even more so, loved watching MTV VJs flounder as they had to repeatedly play \\"Midlife Crisis\\", the first single from this album, despite thinking to themselves, \\"Eww[...] is dark!  And gross!  I don't like this!\\"<br /><br />And thus was most of the mainstream's response to Angel Dust.  Where The Real Thing promised a new wave of melodic weirdness, Angel Dust seemed to suggest that this band was actually...well...just on Angel Dust.<br /><br />However, fans of music, and not simply trends, recognized and continue to recognize the absolute brilliance of this album.  If you are looking for a good reason to pick this album up, I have over 190 that average out to give this masterpiece a five star rating; many written within the past year.  This is a testament to this album's widespread appeal, and reassuring longevity.<br /><br />In many ways, Angel Dust is The Real Thing on steroids, and the results are much like hitting an extra 35 homeruns a year:  quite exciting and frightening at the same time.  The riffs are better, the bass pounds louder, the drums accentuate the ever-so subtle tribal rhythms of this band better than before, and Mike Patton, possibly the most underrated influential rock musician of our time, displays such a range of feeling and technique that I simply cackle to near suffocation when I hear people drool over Mariah Carey's high-pitched squeal of limited emotion.  I mean seriously, with his collaborations with the Root's Rahzel, the X-Ecutioners, Fantomas, The Dillinger Escape Plan, hip-hop underground producer extraordinaire Dan the Automator, and his Mr. Bungle and solo releases, Mike Patton has ever so quietly changed the face of progressive rock/metal, and the road began with Angel Dust.<br /><br />This is an unclassifiable album, except to say it is one of the best ever.  Incorporating maniacally perverse melodies (Kindergarten, Land of Sunshine, Crack Hitler), previously unheard levels of heaviness (Malpractice, Smaller and Smaller), and quirkiness that makes The Real Thing seem like an episode of 7th Heaven (Be Agressive, A Small Victory, and my personal favorite, the scummy jazz lounge-tinged ditty told from the perspective of a drunk trailer-park dad, RV) Angel Dust is a ride with, literally, non-stop thrills.<br /><br />What Faith No More hit upon with this album is that rarely-attained holy grail of originality, catchiness, and timelessness.  The production is so tight, with all songs building to near pandemic choruses.  This feat is accomplished by carefully brewing the instrumental ingredients, and with swirling/twisted carnival keyboards, prominent and absurdly abrupt bass notes, crunchy, yet crystal clear guitar tone, tribal drumming, and the brilliantly schizophrenic vocal stylings, Faith No More were able to create a masterpiece which immediately calls to mind those works of art which will never be replicated.  At the very least I can say that 13 years after its release, this is an album that I, and obviously many others, would call one of the greatest albums you could treat your ears to.rporating maniacally perverse melodies (Kindergarten, Land of Sunshine, Crack Hitler), previously unheard levels of heaviness (Malpractice, Smaller and Smaller), and quirkiness that makes The Real Thing seem like an episode of 7th Heaven (Be Agressive, A Small Victory, and my personal favorite, the scummy jazz lounge-tinged ditty told from the perspective of a drunk trailer-park dad, RV) Angel Dust is a ride with, literally, non-stop thrills.  <br /> <br />What Faith No More hit upon with this album is that rarely-attained holy grail of originality, catchiness, and timelessness.

B000002UAO|3.0|Upon release I became a Beatles fan listening to this album as I was unimpressed with their earlier work.  However I disagree with those who think this UK version is better; the fact that it is missing \\"I Just Saw a Face\\" is reason enough to see it as inferior.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|\\"Maverick\\" was more comedy than western. The westerns of the day were in the shoot 'em up, cattle rancher variety. Gunfights were few and far between here. And if any cattle showed up, it was probably a mistake.<br /><br />Bret and Bart Maverick (James Garner, Jack Kelly) were gamblers with a strange moral code. They were usually out for a con. But if it didn't work out for them, they'd make sure that it worked out for someone else... and never for the bad guy. All the while, they spouted life's little lessons as taught to them by their beloved Pappy.<br /><br />While Garner and Kelly would trade off episodes during the series, sometimes the brothers Maverick would come together for a little bit of fun. Two of those episodes are featured here. On occasion, they would bump into their British cousin, Beau (Roger Moore)... just an FYI as he's nowhere to be seen on this disc.<br /><br />\\"Shady Deal at Sunny Acres\\" starts out as a Garner episode and turns into a Kelly episode as the brothers team to take down a crooked banker (John Dehner).<br /><br />\\"Pappy\\" brings the brothers together again as an old friend (Troy Donahue) warns them that their Pappy intends to wed an 18-year old. This was the only appearance by their Pappy in the series. It also features a cameo by their Uncle Bentley.<br /><br />\\"Guy Shy\\" (my personal favorite on the set) is a parody of the day's number one western, \\"Gunsmoke\\". With a painfully earnest performance by Marshal Mort Dooley (instead of Matt Dillon). Maverick has done nothing wrong, yet is booted out of Elwood by the good Marshal. A marshal who becomes increasingly frustrated every time Maverick returns. Their \\"gunfight\\" is a real hoot.<br /><br />Hopefully, Warner Brothers will make more episodes of this great series available soon.
B0002NRRAG|3.0|I have never heard somebody capture the Billie Holliday sound as well as this woman. Unfortunately, once the novelty of that feat wears off, I was left wondering why I simply didn't play a Billie Holliday CD. I still give this CD three stars, because \\"Dance Me to the Edge of Love\\" is a great cut, and her voice, as well as the songs themselves, are very pleasant to listen to. I hope this woman will find a more original way to convey the music that is clearly in her soul.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Nice balance of action cue music and lighter mood/motifs exploring the emotional/psychological side of the Dark Knights origins.  I'm still a huge fan of Tim Burton's Batman but still thoroughly enjoyed Chris Nolan's new vision.  One of the few scores this year I've enjoyed repeated listening too as I find film music of late (as with recent Hollywood movies) uninspired.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Listen to the old school gem \\"We Belong Together\\" and any doubts that u might've had about Mimi will fade instantly. Mariah is dead-on when it comes to taking her already-so-successful career to a whole new level with this record: It works. And the resurrection is complete. That one track has catapulted her into a whole new league...14 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100! - Shows that she's still at the top of her game....she's already scored the top single of 2005, not to mention one of the best and most popular songs of her career. Mariah & JD work like a dream: check out \\"It's Like That\\", \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"Get Your Number\\" besides that biggest hit off the record. But thats where things stop looking as good - Pharell does an OK job on \\"To The Floor\\" with guest rapper Nelly, while Twista brings some much needed slickness to \\"One and only\\". That's It. The remaining tracks on the record are hardly worth mentioning since they barely even stand out. Although we know how great a voice Mariah has - she apparently switches from the Alto Range to The Coloratura Soprano Range as effortlessly as she can access her signature 'Whistle' register - most of her attempts at pop-r&b balladry fizzle completely since her irrelevant warblings render the songs almost incoherent. This record is Good. Just not Very Good.
B00008977N|5.0|I've had this for a while and then a friend that visisted me from NY liked it so much that i gave it away. I bought it again recently, and although I've watched it many times, every time i see it again it's a blast. Great music performed by great musicians!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera never ceases to amaze me! Notwithstanding the fact that she's my absolute all-time-favorite artist, hats off to XTINA!! :-) Its such a sheer joy to ride the highs and lows that she generates as effortlessly (and with way more vitality) than Mariah Carey! With a thumbs-up from who else but Simon Cowell... there's no stopping Christina on this record. From the first single - the fantastic club-banger \\"Dirrty\\" with Redman - to what arguably is the best song of her career - the sensual pop ballad \\"Beautiful\\", to her power-to-independent-women anthem \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" with Lil' Kim to the incredibly fun \\"Fighter\\" with Dave Navarro on guitar, Christina keeps outdoing herself with each track! Also check out the raw power of Christina's voice on \\"Impossible\\" (with neo-soul sensation Alicia Keys), the latin-flavored \\"Infatuation\\", the energetic \\"Make Over\\", the soaring ballads \\"Cruz\\" and \\"Soar\\", and the very introspective \\"The Voice Within\\"! She scored 5 radio hits with this record, which is deeper than most artists go. Christina is an A+ lister all the way! can't wait for her new LP to drop spring 2006 on RCA.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|These guys are total posers. I DETEST their annoying music that seems to have mulitple personalities. PICK a GENRE!!! What is up with the mix of Heavy metal, Reggae and R&B?<br /><br />I saw these looooosers on SNL and was amazed at how dorky they were. The lead singer looks like wierd Al Yankovich-seriously, check it out online. You can tell they were probably band geeks in high school. Awful. Just AWFUL>>>>> Really, why'd you make me give them a star. They don't deserve it AT ALL.
6305428220|4.0|I had seen this movie many years ago.  It's one of those it's so bad it's great movies.  I would recommend that you watch it.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Nick, John, Simon, Roger and Andy. These were the first men I ever fell in love with (Well, poor Andy is pretty busted, but the rest make up for it). At one point in my life I have had 376 pictures of the Fab Five plastered on my walls. I was TRULY obsessed. Every drop of my allowance went towards my Duran Duran collection. I love every single song on this album.<br /><br />I saw them in concert this year and they are a hot as ever and it was sooo fun to pretend to be 12 again for just one night as my friend and I drooled and screamed our heads off the entire concert. MUCH more fun this time since I could partake in adult beveridges unlike my fist D2 concert in sixth grade.<br /><br />These songs just put me in a terrific mood and sound just as great today as they did 20 years ago (God I'm old!)
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|In November the whole Europe, as well as Asia, will receive \\"Titanic\\" in a version that truly deserves the name of an \\"ultimate edition\\" - with the three US discs and a fourth disc having the following features: \\"The Heart of the Ocean\\" TV special, the three Titanic parodies, a selection of interviews and cinema/TV teasers and trailers. <br /> <br />Oh, yes. In just a month it is going to arrive.
B0002858YS|5.0|I love Brandon Flowers. LOVE him! He is just so cute and being a former lover of boy bands such as Duran Duran, this was a natural fit for me. I also grew up pretty obsessed with Morissey and the Smiths, and I note a little of that influence in this band.<br /><br />I think \\"All these things that I have done\\" would be my favorite song, albeit the little ditty at the end about, \\"I got sould but I'm not a soldier\\" is pretty dorky and doesn't fit in with the rest of the song, but I'll forgive it because as I mentioned before, Brandon Flowers is just so darn cute.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Spin Magazine is right - it's the best album of the past twenty years.  OK, I may be a little biased; Radiohead is my favorite band.  I've been a fan for over 10 years and I haven't gone more than two weeks at a time without listening to at least some of OK Computer since the week it came out.  I love it, I love every song on it, I love every beat, every blip, every noise, every instrument, I love Thom's voice.  I've listened to this album on every long roadtrip I've ever taken.  I've fallen asleep to it on my headphones countless numbers of times.  (It would be awesome if they would release it in 5.1!)  Radiohead are unique, and they are geniuses.  Buy this album.
B000AL730O|5.0|This album continues the grand tradition of one of this (and last)century's most gifted songwriters. There is an art song quality to this record that is new. The tunes are mostly down-tempo and inspired. The arrangements are highly interesting. Well worth the purchase.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|good packaging <br />great print <br />it was as good as an absoulutely new one <br />thanks
0385338686|5.0|I thought her \\"Shopaholic\\" books were good - but this one has \\"grown up\\" and blows them out of the water! A fantastic concept for a book, the storyline is engrossing and wonderful. You will love the heroine, Samantha Sweeting, who learns a valuable lesson much sooner in life than most people - a chance to know what's really important. Laugh-out-loud funny too, Kinsella has not lost her wonderful sense of humor that is present in every book she writes. Please hurry with the next novel, Sophie, we're waiting!
B00003TL18|5.0|Orbison at his finest, backed up by excellent artists in their own right while maintaining the Orbison sound.<br /><br />If anyone protests the black and white presentation, discount the opinion--they simply don't understand.
B000053VAF|4.0|This film explores some of the more off beat aspects of Christanity in a funny way. If you want to really upset some of the more shall we say less flexible \\"Christain\\" friends and relatives who show up at your home. Then pop this film into the machine and watch the fumes arise. The thing to remember is not to take the film too seriously!
0142000655|5.0|I bought this book and read the first chapter. I put it down for six months. I found the beginning to be almost painful. Where's the story? I had heard that this was a classic, so, determined to get through this book, I dove back in. <br /> <br />I am thankful that I stuck with it. After the first 40 pages, the story really launched into an interesting tale of good an evil. This story will help to change the way you see yourself. The book can be summarized by Steinbeck's monologue on page 413 (Chapter 34): <br /> <br />\\"It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world.\\" <br /> <br />\\"We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly respawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.\\"

B000BB1MI2|5.0|First off I would like to commend Danny Elfman, for comming up with music for the oompa loompa songs, words comming straight from the book and not making them annoying...pure genious:) Secondly the movie is much more detailed and closer to the book then the original, that in itself makes it better. My son loves the music, and so do I. I highly reccommend this movie to everyone....WONDERFULL, AND WITH GREAT MUSIC   :)

B00005JO0J|5.0|First of, I readily admit I'm a Firefly fan - not a Josh Whedon fan, but a Firefly fan. Having said that, I firmly believe you needn't ever have seen the TV series to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Even though most reviews have been positive, I'd like to start out by addressing the negative comments... The first is that it will only appeal to fans of the TV series. As stated above, I don't believe this to be the case and what little feedback I've heard from non-fans has borne out this assumption. Secondly, some have criticized the budget and FX. I'd argue that big budgets aren't necessary to a good SF movie and often get in the way (think George Lucas). In Serenity, there was only one scene, lasting maybe 2 seconds, where the CGI was clearly showing and not up to par, but I can forgive that. The important part is that the FX/CGI are in the service of the script, rather than the other way around.<br /><br />Finally, let's talk performances... One of the thing that people most liked about Firefly was the quality and coherence of the ensemble cast. Wisely (or maybe not - remember the meager budget), Whedon resisted the temptation to toss in a few expensive \\"big names\\" to punch up the box office. The cast still clicks like a well-oiled machine. The audience can respond to their cohesiveness. We easily believe this wildly disparate group of people actually care about  each other.<br /><br />*** Warning: Minor spoilers ahead ***<br /><br />More importantly, even the most reprehensible characters have redeeming qualities, dictated by their histories. There are no 2-dimensional good or evil characters. Each has multiple aspects and layers that helps us believe that they're real people rather than archetypes. We may not approve of all of them, all the time, but we do understand them.<br /><br />For far too long, SF films and TV has been focused on action and FX. Even many of the classics (e.g. 2001) are emotionally sterile. Where character development was pursued, I found it often difficult to really care about them (e.g. Blade Runner). While the crew of Serenity might never be the sort of folks I'd seek out to hang around with, they are people I could respect and understand - even in their more questionable choices.<br /><br />I expect to see this at least twice more in the theater, and will then eagerly await the DVD release.<br /><br />Now, if they'd only make a Babylon 5 movie...found it often difficult to really care about them (e.g. Blade Runner). While the crew of Serenity might never be the sort of folks I'd seek out to hang around with, they are people I could respect and understand - even in their more questionable choices. <br /> <br />I expect to see this at least twice more in the theater, and will then eagerly await the DVD release. <br /> <br />Now, if they'd only make a Babylon 5 movie...
B00005JODA|4.0|This is truly a haunting thriller. Excellent photography and superb acting, especially by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. This is a smart thriller dealing with practices of some pharmaceutical companies regarding the testing of new drugs on the African people. This film brings a real behind-the-scenes Africa with just stunning pictures. <br />Overall, besides tackling and investigating the topic of the pharma industry, this is a beautiful, although sad, love story. It's about a man's presumption due to walking by \\"sight\\" and losing trust because of certain strange circumstances suspecting the worst, only to find out later when he sees the whole picture that his presumptions were wrong. Then the guilt, the regret ... but it's too late. <br />I don't think that this movie will necessarily attract the broad movie-going audience, although I think as many people as possible should see this excellent motion picture. You will need to use your brain in order to follow the storyline and don't expect an action movie, but it's a real thriller based on the book by one of the world's top thriller novelists, John LeCarre'. After seeing this movie you will appreciate your daily blessings of living in the civilzed Western world.
B000002KCV|5.0|This is one of Neil Young's best albums. I originally bought this on vinyl when it first came out and it's still great. With the exception of the miserable \\"Motorcycle Mama\\" (\\"Motorcycle Mama won't you lay your big spike down . . . \\") this is a collection of strong, listenable, mostly acoustic songs. Many of these songs would fit well with the acoustic side of \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\". <br /> <br />From the peaceful sounding \\"Goin' Back\\" to the more upbeat \\"Comes a Time\\" to the edgy (with great guitar work) \\"Look Out for My Love\\" (\\"Look out for my love; it's in your neighborhood; I can tell things are gonna change; But I can't say bad or good.\\"), Neil Young has put together one of his best albums from beginning to end. <br /> <br />\\"Peace of Mind\\" (a beautiful song), \\"Human Highway\\" and \\"Already One\\" (\\"'Cause we're already one, already one; Now only time can come between us; 'cause we're already one, our little son; won't let us forget.\\") are more-than-solid efforts. <br /> <br />\\"Four Strong Winds\\" is a cover of a great Ian Tyson song. It fits perfectly with the rest of the album.\\" <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this CD to all Neil Young fans and to anyone else who likes great songs.
B00005JNY4|3.0|For the first half, the plot of Into The Blue is basically a remake of The Deep without the Robert Shaw character.  Two diving couples discover the wreck of the Zephyr, are hampered by the proximity of a sunken plane full of illegal drugs.  The second half is more cat-and-mouse action between the divers and the drug dealers.  There's just enough action, suspense, and intrigue to recommend it as a three-star movie; but if you love the water (the sea, boats, fish etc.) but can't get there in person (like me), it's a four-star movie because of the considerable underwater photography.  There's nothing profound or original; just some nice escapist scenery and suspense.
B000002G6J|5.0|Although bossa nova was already known to the world with albums like Jazz Samba and Getz/Gilberto, this album (recorded in 1967 at Rudy Van Gelder's studio) helped establish Antonio Carlos Jobim himself as a known name.  While Jazz Samba and Getz/Gilberto approach bossa nova with a smaller group, Wave has more of an emphasis on orchestration of stringed instruments, which is arranged beautifully by Claus Ogerman.  However, instruments such as piano, bass, drums, and other percussion are still present. <br /> <br />Wave features instrumental versions of 10 Jobim originals, and each one is saturated with Brazilian bossa nova rhythms.  Most of the songs on here are not jazz standards like \\"Girl From Ipanema\\" is.  In fact, the only songs I would say are jazz standards are \\"Triste,\\" \\"Wave\\" and maybe \\"Look to the Sky.\\"  So, this stands as a great introduction to the music of Jobim.  It ao serves quite well as an introduction to bossa nova, as this was the first bossa nova album I ever listened to.  I have been hooked on the genre ever since. <br /> <br />I would recommend this album to anyone wanting to investigate bossa nova because you'll get to hear some very famous songs with a very authentic bossa nova sound.  But, you also get to hear very obscure Jobim songs such as \\"Captain Bacardi,\\" \\"Mojave,\\" \\"Dialogo,\\" and \\"Antigua.\\"  I believe the obscure songs are more of a standout than the standards because they really translate the instrumental bossa nova sound wonderfully.  I think if you want to know the genre better, then this is one of the first albums you should get.
0765301598|4.0|This is not Frank Herbert's writing, nor has it every been.  The prequel's have been met with mixed reviews thus far and understandably so.  This hopefully being the last of the prequel books it does quite a bit to tie up some ends and finally lead the way to the universe that Frank himself established.  Like the previous books in this trilogy, the book largely focus's on the war itself and tries to execute the story from all the major sides and still mention the other asides as well.  The division of the Zensunnis on Arrakis ties in nicely, but could have been explored further.  The final steps that lead the Sorceresses of Rossak to turn to the Bene Gesseritt's are here.  The further development of Norma Cenva's vision shows further groundwork being laid for the Guild.  And ultimately, the book showcases how humanity's greatest hero's can lose site of their own humanity in the throes of war and the furver of religious persuasion.  And this is where the book is at it's best.  The religious furvor that ignites the Martyrists/Cultists and how the government and even the military bodies use it to bolster their own strength is showcased greatly.  The turning of the mob from a blind raging chaos into something slightly focused, given the right words and right beliefs to hold onto is displayed well.  The character of Vorian Atreides shows himself to be the hero to end the Jihad, but at what cost?  And how much does this hero stand to lose in order to achieve total victory?  The contradictions of war and a few other contradictions rear their heads.   <br /> <br />Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson do a nice job exploring those themes.  They also do something that they've done throughout the entire Jihad trilogy- they don't have a bumbling idiot (Shaddam) and his scheming partner (Hasimir Fenrig) running around making trouble for everyone.  That is one annoyance we could have done without in the first place, and I am glad to see that they realized their own mistake.  Not to say there isn't some comedy; the conversation of the Corrin Omnius with two of its remaining Everminds from two other worlds is pretty funny, if not downright hysterical.  And Erasmus is still good for the occasional chuckle, but deepens further in this book as well.   <br /> <br />On its own merits, the Battle of Corrin is solidly writ and a well told conclusion to a better prequel than the House books.  While some questions still remain, and some of the answers are a little rushed, the book does well to end the story of the hundred plus year war against thinking machines.  It's not Frank Herbert's writing, but it does work well to fill in the gaps and add even more richness to this already amazing universe.  If you haven't liked the prequel books thus far, I don't expect this to change your mind.  However, if you do enjoy them, then maybe, like me, you won't be so worried about the eventual Dune 7 release.  In the meantime, enjoy the read.
B00005ATQD|1.0|Wow.  Don't waste your time.  The view that Eyes Wide Shut challenges the audience is true--it challenges us to make sense of a hodge podge of illogical behavior and occurrences, and why we wasted 159 minutes of our lives on this drivel.  The movie begins well enough, but after the wife's (Nicole Kidman) unfortunate sharing of a sexual fantasy, the husband (Tom Cruise) ends up in wildly improbable set of circumstances, none of which are adequately explained by the end of the film.  What really happened to the piano player?  Why doesn't Cruise call Seattle and check on him?  Why were the men at the sex party so threatened by Cruise's presence, when everyone was wearing masks, the parties' location always changed and was secret. Why doesn't Cruise, who's supposed to be playing an M.D. and should be a little bit more verbal/logical, can't seem to speak without stuttering?  I thought it a bit bizarre that even in the last scene, after Cruise and his family had been threatened, the couple have a lengthy conversation while their little girl wanders off in a Macy-like store, at Christmas! Don't bother keeping an eye on your kid, now.  The worst part was the film's \\"score\\", which at times was a single note theme played on a piano--imagine your 5 year old nephew on the kiddie piano.  The kid would've come up with something better.
B00005JN5X|4.0|What an adventure! And the magic! Wow! I really enjoyed this film. Think back to the first time you saw or read about Cinderella or Little Red Riding Hood. There's something special in those stories, something magical and adventurous in every fairy tale. The Brothers Grimm is one giant fairy tale. And it's amazing. It's a movie that I'm sure the two brothers themselves would enjoy. What makes this fairy tale great is a combination of light, fluffy, happy material and the dark, foreboding material, both of which are set to an amazing film score by Dario Marianelli. And let's not forget the talents of Heath Ledger and Matt Damon. <br /> <br />Damon and Ledger are Wilhelm and Jacob, the famous Brothers Grimm who travel from town to town and ridding each one of a spooky, mythological monster or ghost. What the people don't realize is that the monsters and ghosts are farce, that the brothers create a spectacle about killing the famed creature to extort money from the townspeople. This practice eventually lands the boys in big trouble, and they are sent to the town of Marbaden to assist in figuring out why the children keep disappearing and why the trees in the forest are moving.  Wilhelm is scientific about the whole thing and can't believe that any of it is actually real. The trees must be moving because they are attached to some sort of device, right? Jacob believes the opposite, thinking that the forest is magical and haunted by a legendary, vain queen who was locked in the tower with no doors or steps that still looks over the entire town and forest.  <br /> <br />If you want to know, I suggest you get to a theater, or more practically, wait till it comes out on DVD since this movie isn't playing in many theaters right now. It's definitely worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. The visuals are amazing and the atmosphere, the music, the story, all make this a wonderfully magical film! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

0140177396|5.0|I read Of Mice and Men twice before setting out to write a fair review of it, simply because it was that strong of a book. It ranks among the few novels that have brought a tear to my eye. The entire story is just constructed so beautifully, I was truly blown away by the time I finished. <br /> <br />The characters are all memorable and very interesting, as are there relationships. Lennie is a lovable (albeit slow) giant, and I felt complete anxiety when his fate was still unsure. George is an average man who would probably just blend in with the crowd in life were it not for his large companion. And while these are the two main characters, the entire cast is just fabulous. <br /> <br />I actually don't have a single complaint. The format is compact, and I can honestly that this is one story that I will read and re-read over and over. <br /> <br />This novella is a must-read instant-classic for absolutely anyone. It's a touching story with relevant themes that will really get you thinking.
B00003CXAE|4.0|Bough it for the kids but the material is a bit adult at times...but they love the songs.
0553278223|2.0|The Martian Chronicles is a group of stories that range from melodrama to quirky comedy, and everything in between. <br /> <br />I read this book at a slow pace, usually two or three of the stories a day. I think this was a good decision on my part as it helped to really demonstrate how drastically the stories change from the beginning of the novel to the end. <br /> <br />The quality of each story, just like their genres, range greatly. There are the very good ones such as 'Ylla', 'The Earth Man', and 'The Third Expedition; and there are the very bad ones such as 'Usher II', 'The Off Season', and 'The Silent Towns'. The only thing that seems to tie all of these tales together is their shared inherent aberrancy. <br /> <br />The book has a sloppy nature to it at times. Also, certain things were seemingly assumed, while they should have been explained in much more detail. The most notable example of this is the war on Earth and the mass migration from Mars. It all just seems very empty. <br /> <br />Overall, it was a very flawed book, and at times became highly confusing. Some of the stories were quite interesting, so it is a shame that the good is overshadowed by the bad. I would suggest reading it if you're a huge fan of Ray Bradbury, but if you don't like it from the beginning don't bother continuing, as it goes down hill very progressively.
B00001OH7N|5.0|Yes, it's a great CD, yes, it's heavy and if you're a Bowie fan and don't own it yet, you aren't a Bowie fan after all.  The thing people have danced around and I'll come right out and say it, consequences be d@mned, but for such an ugly little reptile of a middleaged Brit, Bowie's actually quite gorgeous as a woman.  As straight as I am, I'd totally hit that!<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />epsteinsmutha
076790592X|4.0|I was very skeptical as to whether I would get anything out of Tuesdays With Morrie when I saw it was part of my required reading. I had heard that it tended to drag on, and became extremely tedious by the third or fourth meeting of Mitch and Morrie. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the novel by the time I had finished. <br /> <br />Although Tuesdays With Morrie is largely about accepting death as your last big adventure, there are several \\"mini-lessons\\" that can be taken from it as well. <br /> <br />It brings up interesting points about blind acceptance in organized religion. Morrie's advice on the matter is to be a skeptic, but do not swear off all the principles of any religion. He though all religions had something to offer, and you should pick and choose which ones are right for you. <br /> <br />Morrie's teachings are quite deep, and useful if you have an open mind. He talks about finding happiness in love, creating your own culture, and the fears of death and aging. However, these discussions between the author and Morrie are just the tip of everything this book has to offer. <br /> <br />At one point, it describes how Morrie gave all of his students A's so that they wouldn't lose their draft deferments. It also describes how Morrie solved a standoff caused by a group of black students who had commandeered a school building, draping a banner out front that read \\"MALCOLM X UNIVERSITY\\". Morrie felt compassion for the protesters, and before long everyone was happy. Morrie is a wise character, at times it's even hard to believe he was a real man. It is these short tales of \\"an old man\\" that are truly touching. <br /> <br />However, Tuesdays With Morrie is definitely not for everyone. It's a book riddled with deep emotions and perplexing life questions. I would recommend it to anyone who is spiritual or interested in becoming more spiritual, especially those with a liberal mind. It's an inspiring book if you're willing to open yourself up to it.
B000000WF0|5.0|The Verve are like a fine wine.  They get better with age and more people want a taste.  Although they are no longer, a resonance has lasted these many years.  Urban Hymn is an effortless affair.  Each track has something painfully beautiful about it.  Everyone knows Bittersweet Symphony and Lucky Man, due to their heavy rotation on movie soundtracks...I want to spotlight other tracks that lie wait in the shadows.  Velvet Morning is to me their finest hour on the album.  A brilliant slow burner that starts at a trot before rolling into a magical gallop.  This time has a slight Stone Rosey mersey shuffle with a taste of the Verve's first outing.  For those who love the cavernous guitar wash of McCabe then Catching the Butterfly and Neon Wilderness will take you back, but for those who look forward...there is a glimpse of Ashcroft's solo style in haunting ballads like The Drugs don't work, Weeping Willow and One Day.  But nothing holds the Verve's mastery of the burning ballad as strong as the track Sonnet.  The beauty of this song is everlasting.  Sure, we have Radiohead, Jeff Buckley and Elliot Smith for tender glass breaking tear-jerkers...but The Verve bring hope to their lost causes and I certainly can identify.
B00003CX9E|4.0|I honestly enjoyed this movie. I don't think it was one of the greatest films that I have ever seen...but it is a really good film. The film's pacing had nothing wrong with it. The people who say this movie is boring are the people who are missing the point. The movie is slow to build on everything because it wants you to get to know Charles Foster Kane enough to get an honest opinion on what kind of person he is. It has good character development and the movie even views Kane from several different perspectives. These perspectives (shown through the eyes of other characters) give several dimensions to Kane. You need to pay attention to the meaning behind several things in the movie such as the importance of \\"Rosebud\\" and how that represents the time in his life where he was truly loved and had true happiness. If you truly give the movie a chance, you just might like it.     P.S. If you view the movie with no expectations, then you will most likely like it better than if you expect it to be the best film that you ever watched upon first viewing.
B0002FR07O|5.0|Not as ambient or techno as the previous album (Sky Moves Sdieways), Signify is still their last really trippy, psychadelic themed album, before Wilson started opting for a more straight-forward mainstream sound with their next album, Stupid Dream. <br /> <br />This is a bonafide rock album though, with a great opening rock instrumental in the title track, and it just gets better from there. An under-appreciated gem in this band's canon, from one of the most criminally under-appreciated bands in rock history. <br /> <br />As far as the second disc is concerned, if you already have a CD copy of this, you might still want to get your hands on this two-disc set (provided you like PT). The second disc in this new re-issue (called Insignificance) is at the very least every bit as good as most of Wilson's side projects, including Blackfield. Sure, some of these songs are merely rough drafts of some of the songs on the original, but some of these songs are 'new' (at least to me) having only been released to the public in this set (evidently, it was available through PT's website back in '97). Even the rough drafts bring something to the table though. But the previously unreleased material is top notch PT. (see Sepulhead's review for a more indepth, song by song essay---I think he's spot-on) <br /> <br />And of course, the sound is sumptuous, as was the case with the first CD. I'd say this is the watershed release for this band, deserving of all the recognition that a re-issue might give it. If you're reading these reviews while sitting on the fence as to whether or not you should spend the money on this set, then rest assured, it will be money well spent. Recommended, again.
B00000AOUD|4.0|\\"A Passion Play\\" is the first Tull recording I owned, back at its release, and the first one I bought again on CD when I started rebuilding my collection. \\"Thick As A Brick\\" was the second in both cases. It is still wonderful but still ever so slightly my second-favorite (tied with \\"Minstrel in the Gallery,\\" which will be the next purchase).     I'm not so sure why I put \\"Thick As A Brick\\" in that position, though. The band is just as precise, and there's even a bit more flute and tasty guitar licks. The keyboards again drive things forward (I'm a sucker for big Hammond sounds). The music is simpler, which may be more to some people's taste. The lyrics are just as literate and evocative, if more down-to-earth. They're even more overtly amusing, though I have never understood why everyone - Ian Anderson included, it seems - finds \\"A Passion Play\\" to be humorless. It's like preferring \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" to \\"The Waste Land.\\" (Yes, I just compared Ian Anderson to T. S. Eliot. He deserves it.)     I think the reason that I favor \\"Thick As A Brick\\" slightly less is that either the initial production or its remastering is not as good. Everything is a bit pinched-sounding, even muddy at times. There isn't a lot of kick to Barlow's drumming - something that is *not* a problem in later recordings - and Hammond's bass tone is ugly and sometimes even flat. From the interview included on this edition, I'd guess that the fault is in the original recording and not correctable. Also, this isn't as personal a work as \\"A Passion Play,\\" and that comes across in Anderson's rather detached vocals.    As far as the extras included on this set, the interview is fun but probably not worth a second listen. The live recording features some of the worst intentional and unintentional vocal echo/delay I've ever heard along with its overall bootleg-quality muddy mix. The only thing I got from this is that Madison Square Garden sounds just as bad as the converted ice hockey arena that was the Tulsa Civic Center, where I saw Tull live twice in the 1970s. A little bit of typically wry and warm stage patter, though, starts it off. There are likely better live recordings out there.    Oh, well. I'm glad to have this again, and I'd recommend it for anyone who's curious or who wants to see if their memory of it holds up. See if you can find a used LP with the full newspaper, though, or you'll be missing out.
B00006EXL5|4.0|This is a great cd. The guitar is catchy and Gerard's vocals are very strong and hard to understand like usual. Obviously, this cd isn't as well put together as Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, but this is definently a great start.  <br /> <br />There are some really catchy and memorable riffs in songs like Drowning Lessons and Headfirst for Halos. Those songs just clicked. Then there are a couple songs that aren't so great. It's like the vocals don't match up with the guitar. And then there is Skylines and Turnstiles. That song just downright sucks. It's terribly recorded, as are a few of the other songs. Although I heard it was the first song Gerard Way ever wrote, so I can't be too harsh. ;) <br /> <br />Either way, with it's bad recordings and great riffs it ends up in the \\"Worth Checking Out\\" pile of cds. :D
B00006CXXU|5.0|I absolutle love this album, it is by far the best Christina has made. Her voice realy shines through and the quality of all the songs is WOW. The best songs on the album(although there all great) have to be-Beautiful, Fighter, walk away, cruz, The voice within,get mine get yours and infatuation. If you don't have this album you are missing out..
0385247125|4.0|Soon as I was getting ready to read his book 4 the 1st time after the acquittal this past June of this year, I was amazed that Michael Jackson (My All-Time Main Singer, Artist, Producer, etc.) is still and most definitely The King of Pop. As I said before nobody touch him or mess with him. He's still gon remain the same man and nobody can't take that away from him. To me, he's like a brother, a friend and mentor who can teach all kinds of things. I been a fan to Michael since I was 5 or 6 in 1990 and still is from this day. I thought it'll be easier to checkout the book. For example, there's only 6 chapters but it's not a bad book or a long book but still a real short book. Real interesting stuff and alot of good information I'll say. There 3 things I didn't know about Michael 1. He's a vegetarian who doesn't eat meat 2. He's a Devout Jehovah's Witnesses and 3. That he's really shy and doesn't even too much talking or too many interviews 'cuz that'll interfere him. Long period short. I just pray in God's Hand that Michael, Jacko, Mike or MJ will just come back and do a 2nd follow-up to his classic bestseller like for instance 'nother memoir (or autobiography) or perhaps a poetry book. Still can't wait to read it over the 2nd time above. God bless the King of Pop for hard book. Luv ya Michael. I'm a real Diehard fan to your music and you'll always be my hero growing up in Music.

B000000OQF|4.0|Guns N Roses will probubly go down in history as one of the great rock bands of all time; and this is the perfect \\"sex,drugs,and rock n roll\\" cd. Axel Rose and Slash are rock n roll icons, no matter how f_cked up they were. Who isn't?<br /><br />There are so many good songs on this cd. and thats rare to find a cd with as many \\"hit\\" songs as this. I really like the song \\"Rocket Queen\\"<br /><br />Appetite For Destruction embodies a side of me. A side that doesn't really give a f_ck. An attitude. Just something about it.<br /><br />This is one bad ass album.

0440237688|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is a thoughtful, interesting book.  Lois Lowry writes about a controlled society and a boy finding his way through life in that community.  The book raises issues concerning constant control and makes the reader consider everything they take for granted in their daily lives.  The book itself ends with the reader still questioning how Jonas' life ends.  Personally, I liked The Giver for the questions it raised and how it made me actually think about what life could be like.  The only thing I found that it should have more of was adventure or some excitement.  It was a very thoughtful book, and not a book to read just for entertainment purposes.
B00008972S|5.0|Amazing movie...Amazing DVD.<br /><br />The Story 10/10...the Songs 10/10..the lyrics 10/10...the dancing 11/10...the colour, shots, scenery, lighting 10/10.<br /><br />I wish I knew something about politics in the US at this time....it was after the \\"Macarthy Era\\"?<br /><br />I'm gonna go ask my dad what it was like watching this in the cinema when it first came out...wow it must have been amazing....this DVD I think will help us too young to have been there to capture a little of that feeling.<br /><br />(I wonder/fear that if they did a modern Holywood remake if they would change the ending!!!!)
B00005O3VC|4.0|Silly, low-budget send-off (clop-clopping coconut shells for horse hooves - on screen) of the Arthurian legends, with the whole Monty Python team.  If you happen to know any medieval buffs such as are in the SCA, chances are they can quote at least a dozen classic lines from this film.  I've seen it a number of times over the years, and enjoy it again each time.
006016848X|5.0|This book is an easy read and full of practical advice.  I never knew why I was not happy in any relationship, even with the most loving men, until I read this book. While I read this book, I spent most of the time laughing at how true to life it is.  It was like reading my own life!  I strongly recommend this book to both men and woman.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I've always loved this movie.  It's a classic for the X-generation and even baby boomers like myself.  It can be watched over and over!!!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|i downloaded the songs in a server like a month before the release, and i was shocked!!!! it's sooo much \\"happier\\" than the other ones. From Takk 'till Heystan you can feel the light that comes from this album. What i totally loved about this album was that many of the songs have a lot of lyrics, not just short phrases, and you can hear drums with a protagonic role, not like the other albums. You should totally go get this album, it's very different from the other ones but still you can feel the esence of Sigur Rs.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I have not wanted to see a movie twice while it was still in the theater in at least 20 years.  My first thought on leaving the theater last night was, man I have to see that again!  The movie absolutely rocks.  Kaylee gets the two best lines of the movie, River kicks butt, and there is plenty of action.  I am so glad I bought the DVD set a few weeks ago on the advice of many of my friends.  I won't give away the plot, but Joss Whedon has outdown himself!  I have already signed up with Amazon to be notified when the movie is available on DVD.
0062502182|1.0|I would not care to write a review of this book if it were not for the contrast between it's value and it's popularity. Mas-media praise it for alleged inspirational power and spiritual wisdom. Yet this is simply a weak book, poorly written. The author tries to hide this fact stating that this is a symbolic text and implying that it's simplicity is intentional. But the truth shows: pedestrian style and banal story without ANY spiritual, intellectual or emotional depth to enrich it. The `truths' and `wisdoms' that Coelho tries to sell here are neither truths nor wisdoms but shallow, incoherent and often plainly silly ideology. Anyone with basic Christian/spiritual education and who sees with his own eyes rather than accepts mas-media cooked facts will see that the king is naked. I am certain that the popularity of the book is artificial. It smuggles an amalgam of anti-Christian `new-age' ideology (pantheism \\"world is only the visible aspect of God\\", determinism \\"maktub - it is written\\", frank paganism `sun - wisest being in creation' and vague feel-good-follow-your-dream spirituality) in a form digestible for half-intelligentsia. Popularity that it 'achieved' shows how spiritually illiterate became the neo-pagan societies in our countries. Truly a \\"Master Work\\".
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I love for my family to spend time together and this did the trick.
B00019PDKC|5.0|The guy who said this was the worst album he bought should go back to his Linkin Park and Fred Durst clone bands and do Anathema a favor and not listen to them anymore.  Anathema has surpassed their cookie monster roots and have become crafters of the best music on the planet -- to some, me included.  This is an album that can be listened to and then listened to again, right after.  This is music for serious music appreciators, and I, as a 38 year old established man, love every note Anathema have played for the past 10 years.  I cannot wait for the next release.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much. Love Johnny Depp
B00079FUI6|5.0|I resisted Desperate Houswives because of all the hype, then finally gave it a chance and was impressed that the writers had taken what is essentially an over-the-top nighttime soap opera and turned it into a subversive, witty, character-driven plot that shows the tiger's claw that lurks beneath the velvet carpet of modern suburbia. Everyone is beautiful, affluent, hip, educated and yet for all their privilege the characters are \\"desperate,\\" scared, lost, full of secret demons, and compulsive. Their wills clash, and we see the resulting tumult, which is always surprising and has the right touch. One of the saving graces of this series is that it achieves a balance between showing the dark side of modern domesticity while never taking itself too seriously.<br /><br />Fans of Desperate Housewives will appreciate the Showtime series \\"Weeds,\\" which deals with similar themes in a similar setting.
B0001Z36PK|5.0|after the Regeneration album, i wasn't sure what to expect from this new Divine Comedy album. the band that i had initially fallen in love with, had drastically decided to change their style; going from charming and bombastic pop with a dramatic flair, to a more moody and slightly Radiohead-ish kind of sound.<br /><br />i found myself beginning to like their newfound sound, but i missed the charm of the older material. now with the brilliantly titled \\"Absent Friends\\", Neil Hannon and company seems to have found the perfect balance between the charm and the mood. \\"Leaving Today\\" and \\"The Wreck Of The Beautiful\\" are some of the most achingly gorgeous melodies that have ever seen the light of day. these songs are like the kind of pop songs that Erik Satie might have written if he were a pop star. really affecting and haunting. and it's so so good to have the humor back in the lyrics. i really missed the wit in such lines like \\"you and i go together like the molar and the drill\\" from \\"Sticks And Stones.\\" there are so many great and classic songs on this album that if i were to go through them all, it would just be non-stop gushing. so suffice it to say, this is my favorite Divine Comedy album and a great place to start if you're the slightest bit curious about this wonderful and irresistable band. and is it just me, or does the song \\"Freedom Road\\" sound just like another song? i cannot place it. is it a cover? hmmm..drives me crazy everytime i hear it. oh well... Absent Friends is a perfect album full of priceless orchestral moody pop songs that are truly unforgettable. listening to this, i can finally appreciate the previous album, Regeneration even more now; because it's the stepping stone to this unrivaled greatness.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This is a MIND blowing concert from the 1986 \\"Magic\\" tour by Queen. Amazing production values and superb musicianship--Freddie Mercury and the band blew the socks off this crowd and it just had my husband and I shaking our heads in sadness--Freddie Mercury was THE quinessential frontman. How sad that he's now gone. A unique band with a unique frontman. Enjoy!
B000062YAZ|5.0|Excellent musicianship, intensity, lyrics, etc...Very few bands playing today can match the sheer power of the music on this record.  To compare this band and record to bands of today is not worth wasting the time to answer.  Slayer has been doing it longer and harder than anyone, and while bands like Metallica have grown ever softer over the years (I stopped listening to their records a long time ago), Slayer has stayed true to their music and we are lucky for that.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I just finished watching this film. I've had in my mind for a long time now that I had to watch this film. Had I watched it earlier, I would have realise how seamless this film is in terms of storyline and shock value._Ashton Kutcher_ plays the role of not one but two lifetimes. This movie is probably ONE OF THE THREE most engrossing films I have seen in the latter half of this year. It took me one hour to realise what the film was all about and it took me an hour and five mins to realise I was wrong. This film is likely to question your own ability to access your own sub-conscience and thought analysing extremes. The last half an hour of the film was gripping and also extremely well directed. The pace of the film is shocking and the effects are super. I can go on and on about the film but I would never really be able to fully comprehend in my review what this film is \\"all\\" about.Hey reader, Watch this film you think you deserve the need to deserve to watch it.<br /><br />PS - The other two films that shocked me this year were \\"Oldboy\\" and \\"Crash\\" [Click on me for reviews]
B000006TRV|3.0|The thought of Pink Floyd making an album that would equal (and eclipse!) \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" in terms of popularity just sounds absolutely ridiculous, yet in 1979, the rock Gods managed to repeat their former success with \\"The Wall\\", an immensely ambitious double-album about an alienated rock star named \\"Pink\\" which has world-record level sales worldwide. It even had a movie to go along with it, fer heaven's sake!<br /><br />Although many see \\"The Wall\\" as the defining Floyd album, I see it as anything but. This album was the beginning of the end for Floyd. This is where Roger Waters' role in the band changed from rock band leader to rock music tyrant, as his portion of the album is far too large, and David Gilmour's portion is far too small, not to mention Richard Wright and Nick Mason didn't even HAVE any say in the writing, which justified Wright's exit from the band during the recording of the album. And that means you won't find any writing in the veins of the Wright-based \\"Great Gig In The Sky\\" or Mason's awesome roto-tom intro to \\"Time\\" on here.<br /><br />There are far too many tracks on \\"The Wall\\" which are used only for the sake of developing the plot of the album, which gives a fairly pedestrian, unoriginal look at alienation. Sure, \\"Another Brick In The Wall: Pt. 2\\" is hilarious, and gives you some great lyrics to spout at your 1st period math teacher, and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is also very well done (although inferior to DSOTM's \\"Us And Them\\"). But overall, the story > music approach detracts from what could've been a \\"best album of all time\\" contender.<br /><br />Stick with the Floyd Trinity: Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals, which were albums that each member contirbuited to. And FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, stay away from the hell-hole that is \\"The Final Cut\\".
B00008BXJG|5.0|This gift brought a middle aged man back to his high school years.  Any individual that is a huge fan of AC/DC should have this CD in their collection.  I have become initiated to the world of AC/DC between this CD and the other I purchased at the same time.

6305907145|2.0|I had hoped that I would find at least some semblance of Austen's \\"Mansfield Park\\" in this adaptation...and indeed I did.  The characters had the same names.  Beyond that, it was almost unrecognizible.  I realize that film adaptations of books are seldom on the mark exactly...but I have seen other of Austen's works recreated on the 'big screen' and this one pales in comparison.  I enjoyed some of the actors/actresses...but this is not a movie I would recommend to anyone who has ever read \\"Mansfield Park\\".  If you haven't read the book then you probably won't be too disappointed.
B00005JO0J|5.0|WARNING:  Multiple spoilers!<br /><br />I first discovered the world of FIREFLY upon the release of the DVD set and had been anxiously awaiting the release of the feature film since I first learned two years ago that it was going to be made, even suffering this past spring when they moved the release date from April to September.  I am ecstatic to report that it was worth the wait and I can't imagine even the most tepid fan of the series being at all disappointed with the film<br /><br />At the end of the series, which was cancelled without the initial story arcs being resolved, and which in most probability show up in the feature film, I was left with three main questions:  1) what would have happened with Mal and Inara, 2) just precisely what was the deal with River, and 3) what was the secret of Shepherd Book's background.  The film only deals with the second of the three questions in full and merely hints at the first.  As the series ended, Inara, after she and Mal had pretty much confessed that they had strong feelings for one another, indicated that she was going to leave Serenity.  The movie starts back up with her gone, but not back to the life of a companion, but to what Mal would call the Whore Academy, presumably as an instructress.  In watching the show, most of the romantic interest of the series focused on whether the two would hook up, and the film ends with Inara back on Serenity, obviously loathe to leave, though with her and Mal's status not at all defined.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely that any answers will ever be forthcoming about Book for reasons that are made obvious to anyone seeing the movie.<br /><br />The structure for FIREFLY was given, however, not by romance, but by the question of precisely who River Tam was, what the Alliance had done to her, and why they were so intent on recapturing her.  At the end of the series we knew only a little about her, that she possessed some kind of psychic ability, that she was physically agile, that she was a genius, and that she had been shattered by her experiences.  We had gotten glimpses of what she was capable of, such as memorably shooting three soldiers at a distance with a handgun with her eyes closed, or dispatching of a bounty hunter who had overcome all the other crew members in a way that suggested she found it a mildly diverting game.  Here we get the complete version, seeing everything she is capable of, going into a bar and battering everyone in it in a few seconds, including Jayne, who proved to be no match for the tiny girl.  But it leaves Mal and the others with the question of whether she was only a weapon or also a human being.  Summer Glau, whose first acting job came on ANGEL when Joss Whedon needed a professional ballerina for an episode, does a good job as River.  The role is more about movement and posture than anything and choosing a dancer for the part was a great decision.  Her ability to move is key to her success in the role and is crucial to her fight scenes being so believable.<br /><br />The film is much, much darker than the series, darker even than the way Mal was portrayed in the series premiere (not as broadcast but as it appears on the DVD set).  Jayne says before they hold up a bank, \\"Let's go be bad guys,\\" and in a way they do.  Of course, by the end of the film Mal's suppressed idealism comes back and the crew ends doing something rather heroic in the name of the truth.  The movie is also dark because of all the reavers.  Not only there lots of reavers, we learn the secret of their origin and how this is entangled with precisely why the Alliance is so desperate to find River.<br /><br />As fans of Joss Whedon know, he loves a good body count (I once counted a total of seventeen significant deaths on BUFFY and ANGEL) and SERENITY is not exception.  Not all the crew survives and indeed at one point it wasn't obvious that any would.<br /><br />All in all, this is the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long, long time.  Ihonestly can compare the fun to other experiences such as seeing STAR WARS for the first time or THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The plot was rich and fun and the action sequences were plentiful and delightful.  Chiwetel Ejiofor was absolutely splendid as The Agent, the man without a name or security number who sought the capture of River in order to create, as he imagines it, a better world.  Whedon loves to play with viewer's expectations in his various projects, and the way he handles The Agent is no exception.  The sets were marvelous throughout and frankly I liked the way the film made outer space look much better than George Lucas did in THE PHANTOM MENACE.  In the latter special effects were employed with something approaching baroque excess while in SERENITY they are used only so far as they are necessary to tell the story.  Also, the film was filled with the marvelous one-liners that seem to permeate the script.<br /><br />So what's next?  A renewal of the TV series is banned because of the 12-year TV ban that was part of the deal they struck with Universal in getting the film made.  The word is that the studio hoped to make a trilogy of films depending on how well the film does at the box office.  The first weekend the film has done well though not spectacularly.  Luckily, Whedon brought the film in under budget and under time, two considerations that are of major significance.  My own guess is that the film is going to do well enough for Universal to pick up the option for another film.  Just have DVD sales for the series has been astonishingly high, so I would expect the DVD sales to be superb.  With Whedon's productions far more popular in Europe and the UK than in the US, the film should do exceptionally well on the international box office.  I expect that in the end it will turn enough of a profit to demand a second film.  Besides, we need to see how things turn out between Mal and Inara.long time.

In the latter special effects were employed with something approaching baroque excess while in SERENITY they are used only so far as they are necessary to tell the story.  Also, the film was filled with the marvelous one-liners that seem to permeate the script. <br /> <br />So what's next?  A renewal of the TV series is banned because of the 12-year TV ban that was part of the deal they struck with Universal in getting the film made.  The word is that the studio hoped to make a trilogy of films depending on how well the film does at the box office.  The first weekend the film has done well though not spectacularly.  Luckily, Whedon brought the film in under budget and under time, two considerations that are of major significance.  My own guess is that the film is going to do well enough for Universal to pick up the option for another film.  Just have DVD sales for the series has been astonishingly high, so I would expect the DVD sales to be superb.  With Whedon's productions far more popular in Europe and the UK than in the US, the film should do exceptionally well on the international box office.  I expect that in the end it will turn enough of a profit to demand a second film.  Besides, we need to see how things turn out between Mal and Inara.
0783226888|1.0|This is just a piece of *** <br /> <br />Hollywood has shown here that they just have no new ideas/stories so they continue to try and use special effects and a bad scriptwriters to remake what was and still is one of the best movies ever. <br /> <br />This is not the first Hollywood remake that is garbage and will not be the last but as long as there are people willing to part with good money to watch movies it won't change.  <br /> <br />This is a good reason why Blockbuster have lost sales recently - nothing worth watching
1402573723|1.0|Cornell U made this their Class of 2009 book. I read Cornell's annual freshman book to stay connected with my alma mater.<br /><br />However, I don't get why Cornell recommended this 1956 book. It leaves one with the strong impression that native Africans are mysoginistic, anti-intellectual and savage. If it was trying to get Cornellians to better appreciate how those in the Third World think, it failed. If Africans still think the way the book discusses, than al Queda will have a never ending supply of recruits.
B00008S2VG|4.0|American Life is by far in the top 5 of Madonna's best albums. A couple of my favorite tracks are \\"X-static Process\\" and \\"Intervention\\" and her emotion really stands out on those . I'm a huge fan of \\"American Life\\" (the title track) and \\"I'm So Stupid\\" because she trashes Hollywood and it's people, who by the way deserve it.  Yeah, if Madonna had waited until the middle of last year to release this album, then she would have sold millions. The only reason why I'm giving this album 4 stars is because I think the lyrics are better than the music.
1573223026|5.0|There are already a lot of excellent reviews of \\"A Long Way Down\\" by Nick Hornby but I couldn't resist adding my own. I won't rehash the plot or the characters, which have value in their own right and have been nicely reviewed by others.<br /><br />I just want to say, there are few authors who pull me into their story, make me feel the people are real, give me something to think about, and make me laugh, all at once. I picked up \\"How to Be Good\\" at a yard sale, loved it, and realized I wanted more of Nick Hornby. I chose this book despite the reviewers who warned me off it. I figured if this one kept me rolling along, enjoying myself, I would be a fan forever. I am. I might add that I have the luxury of reading for pleasure and not as a critic. And I'll also say this would be a good book to read aloud with someone. I lacked that generosity of spirit because I didn't want to slow down.
B00000I07R|5.0|I'm not sure how to work out which is my fave Bon Jovi album.  I have loved the guys ever since I heard Runaway.  However, with each passing cd, I get more confused as to which I love the best.  This is for sure one of them, it's full with so many great songs.  Keep The Faith itself, is my absolute favourite song of theirs ever, and I also love In These Arms, Dry County, Sleep When I'm Dead and Believe.  Any real Bon Jovi fan will already own this, but if you aren't such a big fan, and don't have it by now, GO GET THIS.  These guys have such amazing staying power and on this cd, you can tell why.
B0000024TT|5.0|I know I heard Leonard Cohen's music back in the 70s.  There was a lot of music back then and much of it stayed behind on the LPs. My daughter discovered his music recently and led me to re-discovery.  So I picked up this CD and started playing it while I was doing housework. I found I could not leave the room while it was playing and for the first time in a long time sat down just to listen to the music. <br />What surprised me though, was the CD has had the same impact each time I have turned it on. It definitely has staying power.
B00005JNQS|2.0|I was expecting a Pixar quality movie, you know, where adults are entertained as well?  They tried - and failed.  There can be only so many lame big-butt, fat rear, huge trunk jokes. The first was cute. The second lame. The 20th pathetic.  The animation, while good, was not Pixar quality. It seemed flat.  Sorry I purchased the DVD.  IF you're purchasing it for a brain-dead adult, or a kid under the age of 8, you're all set.<br /><br />Too bad that was not the intended target.  Robin williams is not even close to being funny. He's annoying. \\"Shut up already\\" was all I could think whenever he opened his mouth. We're all tired of the SAME voices he's used in every movie and stand up routine for decades. Sure they were entertaining, in an idiot-savant way, in the 90's.  No longer.<br /><br />Every Bot's voice was poorly cast, with the lone exception of Mel Brooks.
0670033375|5.0|This is a book that should be read by everyone who has any influence on public policy--meaning everyone, but especially the people in our current federal administration.  OK, Bush doesn't read, but he should give it to Condi to read and summarize for him.

0385507755|5.0|I know, I know, Oprah. You love her, everyone loves her, she's great. Whatever.  <br /> <br />Her selection of this book does feel like she arrived three hours into the party, but because she brought the best bottle of wine, she gets all the credit. Still, this is a book worth reading - truly. <br /> <br />The prose has a versey feel to it, be prepared for that - give in to it. The book reads like a song, with a tempo and vibrancy that draws you in immediately. <br /> <br />The characters are moving, effectively drawn and described. Sometimes you read a book and think 'hey I recognize that character he's just like ...' You don't know these people, unless you actually knew them, they are that strongly defined. The story is merely a beautiful frame for the people James Frey has encountered, and his unique observations. By the end of the book you care deeply for this man and the people who surrounded him.   <br /> <br />And once you are done with 'A Million Little Pieces,' go get 'My Friend Leonard' the sequel, guaranteed to break your heart in the best possible way. <br /> <br />

6305744793|4.0|One of the few tv to movie adaptations that truly works.  Director Barry Sonnefeld (Men in Black) takes the cult fave tv sitcom and turns it into a gloriously filmed dark comedy.  Anjelica Huston is marvelous as the quietly seductive Morticia and Raul Julia is perfect as the enamored Gomez.  Of course, Christina Ricci steals her scenes as the demonic Wednesday and Jimmy Workman makes a fine Pugsley.  If Christopher Lloyd can't quite match Jackie Coogan's Fester, it's more the script's fault than his.  Elizabeth Wilson is very good as Lloyd's devious mother as is Dana Ivey as the frustrated wife of nogoodnick Dan Hedaya.  I wish they'd have found more use for Vic Mizzy's marvelous tv theme song, instead of MC Hammer's ridiculous rap contribution.  But the sets are marvelous and the actors deliver their lines with the straight aplomb that made the tv series so unique.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|I now have four different titles by Death Cab for Cutie (not a name that I believe will endear them with the British record buying public, but that's their choice). Each of the CDs are outstanding and show great talent and originality. I thought that 'Transatlantisism' might not be bettered, but 'Plans' is, to my taste, a winner. <br />Gentle but, oh so powerful are their lyrics, even the Smiths struggle to come close, and musically, they are so tight yet adventurous , that I'm not sure how they get away with it. But they do! <br />
B000AARKOO|2.0|This movie was way to slow.I walked into this movie expecting an action packed war movie.I was wrong.This was just 3 hours of talking.All the action in this movie was shown on the previews.The ending of this movie was also pretty lame.I was very dissapointed in this movie.The action looked good but there just wasnt enough.This movie got to much hype.Movie was way to slow.I dont recommend this one.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album strikes a very personal cord with me. I listened to this album everday after I purcahsed it back in 1998. Lauryn Hill shared her pearls of wisdom in the \\"Miseducation  of Lauryn Hill.\\" I like the classroom premise between each track.  And the songs are totally befitting to one another. All of them have to deal with the love, the joys, and the pains of romantic relationships and none of them cross the other out. She kept her focus in the delivery of this album which gives the listener a smooth ride from track to track. I must say Lauryn Hill's album taught me a lot of things about love and it helped ease the pain and frustration, that I was going through at the time. She showed me that somebody else has gone through what I'm going through, someone else has experienced this, and I am not alone. I also have to say I like Lauryn Hills style, she's beautiful . I'm not at all like her; she's very urban, (I'm suburban) she's really natural and ethnic, (I'm a \\"pretty girl\\" who loves pretty things and make-up). I like the fact that she just kept it real she related a very important message to the masses yet she did not change her style she's hip-hop so she kept it hip-hop. I also liked her spiritual messages and references to God and Christianity. A lot of artist that are similiar in sound or genere as Laryn Hill make references to gods and you don't know what god they are talking about, or on the other side their are some that mention God in albums where they should be too ashamed to because of all of the explicit lyrics. They come across as spiritual yet, weird. But Lauryn did the exact opposite. In this album Lauryn exposed her spiritual side and her natural side which is being human.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Mediocre comic book adaptation of the horror comic book lacks a script that makes much sense, an actor who is believable in the main role and a director who was professional enough to do his job. Keanu Reeves is horribly miscast as a supernatural bounty hunter who is trying to save the world from the forces of evil and the script he is working with is just as bad as he is with plot points that make no sense and a revelation in the end that comes out completely from left fiend and literally destroys everything the movie was trying to accomplish. The director of this film really does not know how to stage a scene and make it make any kind of sense what so ever . The only good thing in the entire film is the performance of Rachel Weisz who not only gives too much talent to this film but is the only glue that is keeping the film from totally falling apart. Unfortunately for her, the movie really does not capitalize on her great performances and instead only focuses it's energies on Keanu's bad attitude to steer the movie into a vat of crap.  <br /> <br />I don't know what when wrong with it but from this viewer's standpoint, it's a terrible film.  <br />
B00005JO0J|5.0|I had never seen the Firefly series, but most reviews I read claimed you didn't have to watch it before seeing Serenity. I am truly glad I saw this film, because as soon as I left the local theater I headed over to the store and bought me the entire series of Firefly. I loved all the characters, the witty dialogue, awesome fight scenes, nice SFX, and the non-stop action pace. I really felt like I knew these characters after watching this two hour film. Serenity has Sci-Fi, action, western, and comedy all rolled together in a beautiful balance. This is easily one of the best films I have seen this year, and without question, the best time I had at the movies this year for sure.
B00030590I|5.0|Gorgeous film in the tradition of \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\".  The visuals and choreography are spectacular and the story itself satisfyingly complicated and tragic.  Especially enjoyed the appearances of Tony Leung Chiu Wai who can say more with a glance than a whole page of dialogue, and Maggie Cheung.  Ziyi Zhang was lovely but got to make better use of her talents in \\"House\\". Jet Li was fine, too.  Really enjoyed this film. You've got to see it more than once to really be able to appreciate everything it contains.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is one of the provactive films that I have ever seen on the death of Christ, in our time. It was an amazing interpretation on one of the most influential people in history. I would recommend this film for anyone who has ever sought to be better understand the suffering of Christ in his final hours. It is alarmingly real. It makes you rethink all that you thought you knew that Christ endured.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Jefferson Airplane's \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" is a masterpiece, indeed. The reviews here can tell you that. It is also one of my favorite albums of all time, and  to be honest, I prefer the mono versions of the songs myself. As another reviewer said: \\"The mono version sounds more like the band would sound live. The stereo version sounds fat, reverby, and sounds 'produced'\\". I agree. There is definitely a difference. In particular, the mono versions of \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"She Has Funny Cars\\", \\"Today\\", and \\"White Rabbit\\" lack the stereolized echo. For those interested: there's a CD of this album that was released in 2001 that features both stereo and mono versions. It doesn't feature the bonus tracks that are on the 2003 CD, but it sounds GREAT!
B00005ATQD|5.0|Up until Eyes Wide Shut I didn't view Kubrik as a genius. I liked what he did with about 2/3 of 2001, and that's about it. But faced with his achievement of this film, I am astounded at his genius. <br /> <br />First, let's consider why it had to be Cruise and Kidman. Kubrik needed a working film couple whom he could mold. Another requirement was that the woman had to be comfortable with spending a great deal of time naked. They both had to be attractive, and of the right age. So, if anyone can suggest another couple, they are welcome to try. What will trump them is Cruise's amazing ability to mimic, and \\"hold an emotional note.\\" (No, I am not saying he is a good or a bad actor. He just never got any training.) <br /> <br />A man I respect claims that there can be no great cinema without great performances, and while he is absolutely right, Eyes Wide Shut is the exception that proves the rule. This is the first auteur effort I have ever seen, in my view. Kubrik's mastery of the art of the writer-director permeates every single frame, and every single sound. Only he could create a scene that should have tittillated most (perhaps, prurient) individuals, yet instead ends up being repulsive, lacking in all joy. <br /> <br />This was not a mistake, as some critics with no clue about the craft of cinema might have claimed. This was pure calculation, and immaculate execution. Consider: not much happens in the script. Plenty of visuals take place (note, I did not say action, or plot) with no words being spoken, and that adds to the overall hypnotic feel of the entire film. The deliberate, slow movements of the characters, conversations, camera moves, score, and events hypnotize the viewers, inviting them to surrender to this state of mind. <br /> <br />All hypnosis, however, is self-hypnosis. Unless the viewer agrees to participate, the magic unravels, and the effect disappears. So a particularly narrow-minded person, whose so-called morals are defined by the mores and practices of 17th Century puritains, would reject the premise, wake up, and spend as much or as little of the rest of the film squirming and being shocked. If you believe you fall into this category, I strongly advise you to avoid this film. <br /> <br />For the rest of us who are willing to go on the journey Kubrik lovingly crafted for us, we are taken to places that we had never imagined. The Alice-through-the-looking-glass feel reaches a peak in the so-called orgy scene. If one forgets for a moment that people refer to the scene as an orgy, but instead considers it for its nature, the symphony that is the scene is at the behest of Kubrik's conductorial baton. We are taken on (again) a slow, deliberate ride through what the average audience member believes \\"them rich people\\" would do, since money can buy anything. But even in their moralistic victory, those who do not dream Kubrik's dream find no joy, nor even sufficient prurience, after the censors required that certain acts be covered with digital robed bodies. <br /> <br />My personal bet would be that even if those strategically placed robes weren't there, while some of the acts would be more graphic than the pacified R-rated version, there would still be little joy or enjoyment for anyone. Kubrik was not a pornographer. He was, in the end, an unerring judge of how to move an audience. He was able to show us a place within ourselves we did not previously know, or know very well, no matter whether we were appauled or enthralled. <br /> <br />And that is genius.
0743201140|5.0|I read a lot of books but this is among the top of the list.  After \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\" and \\"First Break All The Rules\\", I'm convinced Marcus writes books that are truly applicable to real life.    A bit of testimony here.  I have over 9 years of work experience mainly in the large corporate world.  My corporate experience was exhilarating.  However, in 1 of the 9 years, I experienced a boss from hell in a smaller organisation.  He was the anti-thesis of \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\".  He sought to find my weaknesses and made me focus on \\"fixing\\" them while leaving my strengths to wither and die.  It was then I discovered \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\".  How timely - other than the Bible, God's own Word, this book also helped me find balance in focusing on my strengths and talents while getting round my weaknesses (and quietly ignoring the manager above for the entire year).    Since then, I bought a copy of the book each for my family, lent a copy to a senior manager, who then promptly bought his own copy!  What this book says is truly real and practical. After this, I read, \\"First Break All The Rules\\" and applied its principles with my staff reporting to me.  I'm now reading \\"The One Thing You Need To Know\\".    Anyway, after my hell year (yes, I made decision to stay for a year to gain the experience as Marketing Manager) in the small  organisation, I've moved back into the large corporate world where I find myself freedom to grow in leaps and bounds.      This book is in the league of Maltz's \\"Psycho Cybernetics\\", Collins & Porras' \\"Built To Last\\" and Collins' \\"Good to Great\\".    Would give it 6 stars!

0316172324|5.0|One of the best books i have read in a while, \\"Blink: The power of Thinking without THinking\\" takes the complicated processes of the mind and translates them into plain english.

The simple explanation of the brain process', and the interesting stories make this book an easy 5 stars, recommended reading for anyone and everyone.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Then again, a few of us out there knew just what we had, and were overjoyed to learn of the Serenity movie, yes, as a chance to expand upon the 14 episode universe we all have grown to cherish, but also as perhaps a vehicle to serve as catalyst for a SECOND SEASON.  Are you reading this Fox?  Anyone with a production company?<br /><br />In my mind, this show is the stuff of legends, which I will watch and rewatch until it is time to purchase another set.  Like the Next Generation, not every episode is perfect....in fact, several times I found myself rolling my eyes at what I was seeing before me (how much of this is Whedon's fault and how much an overzealous Fox's fault it is, I can probably guess).  Still, like TNG, at the close of the final episode, you feel genuine loss that its done.  You've grown to love these people, good or bad, for the ocean-bottom depth that Whedon produced in just 14 episodes.  You learn more about these characters and grow to be a part of it so fast, you really lament it ending.<br /><br />I can't say that about any other show in recent memory.  That it no longer exists is testament to the horrific nature of television today.  I just cannot f'in believe we have another season of Laguna Beach, yet this didn't make a full run.<br /><br />Shame on you Fox, redeem yourself by making a second season.  Heck, finish the first, but give us fans (of the masses growing daily thanks to Serenity) some closure, darnit.<br /><br />Buy these DVDs, but be warned you will painfully miss its magic at the close of disc 4.

B000062YAZ|5.0|REIGN IN BLOOD?  Classic.  What else can be said about this that hasn't already been said?  Well, it's much better than anything Metllica has ever done.  Before REIGN IN BLOOD, there was never any music that sounded like this.  Slayer single-handedly created a new genre of metal with this graveyard classic.  <br /> <br />What makes this album so great is that it combined speed, thrash, and death metal in a nice little package.  There are no death metal vocals, but it's too heavy and fast to be placed algonside Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax.  Right from the opening of 'Angel of Death,' we know we're in for a wild ride.  A song with nazi undertones, this track is a speed metal juggernaut, for lack of a better term!  It also has a signature 'Slayer Harmony' during the bridge section, which is also present in the highlight of the record, 'Raining Blood.'  In this track, the harmony is more pronounced, and sounds similar to 'South of Heaven' on the album of the same name.  It is much faster than 'South of Heaven,' though, and is a mosh classic still to this day.    <br /> <br />Other favorites of mine are 'Postmortem,' 'Altar of Sacrafice,' and 'Jesus Saves,' which obviously is NOT a pro-christian song.   All the tracks on this album are speed metal classics, with very little time in between each.  This gives the album that 'jam' kind of feeling.  Those who call themselves even 'casual' fans of metal, need to own this record.  It still kicks ass after thousands of listens.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|OK, first off, for the best part of 2 years DCfC have been one of my all time favourite bands, and i consider Ben Gibbard to be one of the most under-rated songwriters of our generation. My first buy was Facts+3, and i still consider that to be their finest album, closley followed by Transatlanticism. I was so excited about this album i even convinced my local indie record store to sell 'Plans' to me pre-release. My 1st immpresion was they had lost their way a little. 'Soul Meets Body' was a cute (pardon the pun) R.E.M-like pop song, and 'I Will Follow You Into The Dark' a huge step up from Gibbards work on the 'Home ep' with Andrew Kenny. Nothing special. <br />So then you give it a few more spins, and before you realise it never leaves your stereo! Like most of DCfCs/Gibbards work, it  takes awhile before you start to get into it, realising every little detail in McGerrs fantastic drumming, Gibbards boy-next-door voacls and ,without a doubt, Wallas most accomplished production to date. 'Plans' -in my opinion- is by no means a classic album, but for some frustratingly inexplicable reason, Ben Gibbard and Death Cab for Cutie just dont know how to write bad music. New fans might not 'get' DCfC on the strength of this album (it seems to me like a step back from 'Transatlanticism') but once again, 4 boys from Bellingham WA do good, and it seems likley that alot more people will notice now with a major label backing/increased media exposure. So...not the most convincing starting point for new fans, but another solid effort from a band who never seem to disappoint.  <br />And i didnt even mention The O.C!!!

B00004RFFW|5.0|Still maintaining its hard edge, \\"Lethal Weapon 2 (Director's Cut)\\" manages to add in a bit more humor with the addition of Leo Getz (Joe Pesci).  The chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is one of the reasons why these movies work.  You honestly believe they are (or could be) friends and partners.  The story is well written and the action sequences well choreographed.  \\"Lethal Weapon\\" and \\"Lethal Weapon 2\\" are the best two of the Lethal Weapon series.  Often times a director's cut splices in some extraneous material that is not all that great, but that's not the case here.
B000002JPA|2.0|How can obviously talented musicians turn out something so obnoxious? This was the question running through my mind as a trudged through Dream Theater's \\"Images and Words\\".    Look, I'll try to be fair here. Dream Theater is composed of exceptionally talented musicians; that much is clear. But they are incapable, utterly and hopelessly incapable, of writing or composing anything that elicits any emotion aside from apathy. If I could describe their sound, it would be \\"geeky\\", because much like your typical pedantic, philistinic geek, they are overly focused on technical showmanship at the expense of, well, pretty much everything. Too often the band simply abandons all sense of restraint and goes off the deep end into vulgar displays of masturbatory musical pretentiousness, a trend that has only gotten worse on their subsequent albums.    It's no suprise then, that \\"Images and Words\\" is so mind-bogglingly self indulgent that it almost descends into self-parody. Petrucci is clearly a gifted guitarist, but I would cringe every time he began another bit of his mindless, ultra-fast guitar noodling. The drumming was busy and fast, but like the rest of the album, failed convey any feeling or emotion. The bass might as well have been absent, because it's nigh-inaudible. Cheesy-sounding keyboards are thrown around as if no one had ever used them before. But worst of all is LaBrie's vocals. His high-pitched histrionic wailings are absolutely grotesque; apparently the phrase \\"tone it down\\" doesn't exist in his vocabulary. At no point does the band come together into one, cohesive whole; instead it sounds like the guitars, drums, and vocals all struggling valiantly to outdo each other. A full length LP is a long time to hear nothing but musical chest thumping.    The songwriting and compositon thoughout \\"Images and Words\\" ranges from mediocre to godawful. The album begins with \\"Pull Me Under\\" which is probably the best track, with a decent melody and LaBrie's vocals at their least insufferable. Unfortunately, the album quickly takes a nose dive after that, with the stunningly awful \\"Another Day\\". LaBrie's tortured-bovine vocals, horrid 80's-esque keyboards, and a saxaphone (!) all combine to produce 4 minutes and 23 seconds of pure, easy-listening hell, with no exaggeration. \\"Images and Words\\" does get slightly better from then on, to be fair, but every time I think I have a good song on my hands, Dream Theater has to go and ruin it with their pompous posturing. The songs themselves are poorly structured, and seem to exist only to show off the band's talent. Take \\"Metropolis Part 1\\", for example. Nearly the entire second half of the song is devoted to a long, drawn out passage consisting of nothing but mindless noodling from the whole band.     \\"Images and Words\\" left me thoroughly unimpressed, and is proof positive that simply gathering together a bunch of virtuosos is not enough to produce great music. Dream Theater strike me as a band that would do a lot better playing other people's songs, because their compositional skills are weak, to put it lightly. But if raw musical talent is all your looking for, go right ahead and pick this up.

B00000G3AZ|4.0|While not always a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, I greatly enjoyed this version of the classic story of \\"Emma\\".  The cast (Jeremy Northam, Ewan McGregor, Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, and Alan Cumming) are wonderful and bring such life to their roles.  I love the quick witted humor and the banter between the characters.  Even if you're not a avid reader of classical literature, this story may convert you.

6305754969|4.0|I had already seen Rio Bravo and then heard that this film was a remake of that , but wanted to see Robert Mitchum in the drunk role that Dean Martin played so well in Rio Bravo .  Mr Mitchum does very well .  This is a solid Western and like other reviewers I particularly enjoyed James Caan's character .  The story keeps the characters going as much as the audience - you feel they are making up their minds what to do as it goes along .  I hope we get a Special Edition of this film one day , but this one will do for now .  If you know Rio Bravo , you may well enjoy this film more .  I make another addition to this review which is that the USA Blu-ray is fantastic because it is region free and also has all the special features that we do not get here in the Australian version.
0385338686|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  It had a great pace, and i wasn't one to put it down.  Hmm..i dont quite know what to say..except read it, and you won't be disappointed!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|This score is definately Zimmers best next to King Arthur!It has such an amazing feel that most film scores have a hard time getting right. It makes you feel relaxed when you hear the small sounds of soft drums in the background but also gives you a feeling of horrible loss near the end of the score. but still leaves you felling inspired and happy at the end of it all. Zimmer has captured what made the movie great, he has taken me to a land were strength and honour flow free and love and tradgity rule the land. Hans Zimmer is my favourite composer! And this score only make's me more proud to say that.            -Alex Wright

B0001KU93C|3.0|The partnership of Franco Nero and Sergio Corbucci is not quite up there with that of Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone , but it aspires to that . I expected something different but still worthwhile and the film did not disappoint me . <br /> <br />The film is darker and stays true to the nature of Django's world . In a different film , we may have found out more about him , but that is not important to the story . <br /> <br />The picture quality is mostly good , but some parts of the image are damaged and this is made clear upfront in a little message before the film begins .  <br /> <br />Any Western fan should enjoy this , but keep in mind it is coming from a different perspective . <br />
B00005QZ7U|1.0|My review wont be fair because I only saw the first 15min of the movie. That's all I could take. I didn't see anything that resembled a story or acting. Just a fast moving camera, people screaming and horrible music. After 15 solid minutes of that I had to shut it off. It was making me sick to my stomach.
0393035158|4.0|The End of Faith is an important, challenging and courageous book which is well worth reading.  Harris says many things which need saying about religion but which seldom receive adequate coverage. <br />The notion of restricting our spirituality to activities/beliefs for which there is actual evidence is highly attractive.  But what seems to be missing in the book is adequate emphasis on the current existence of overwhelming evidence that runs counter to numerous existing religious beliefs.  The unfounded rejection of evolution by many religious groups is a striking example. <br />Harris quite rightly says that \\"Nothing is more sacred than the facts.\\" And the factual evidence, from the fossil record and DNA studies, for the occurrence of evolution is absolutely overwhelming.  Those who recognize this have unfortunately allowed the disbelievers to muddy the waters by unfailingly speaking of \\"the theory of evolution\\" -- as if there is a single comprehensive and fully detailed explanation of how evolution actually took place.  <br />It was known by Copernicus and Galileo - long before Newton's theory of gravity - that the earth was not the centre of the universe.  And, Newton's theory of gravity was subsequently superseded by Einstein's theory of gravity which is itself incomplete if not actually defective.  It is exactly the same with respect to evolution.  Darwin's attempts to understand and explain evolution should not be regarded as the last word on the subject.  But, what is incontrovertible is the  occurrence of evolution.  We know from DNA evidence that that all of us human beings are descended, on the paternal line, from a common male ancestor (dubbed the Y-chromosome Adam) who lived some 60,000 years ago.   And, likewise, on the maternal line, we are all descended from a common female ancestor (mitochondrial Eve) who lived some 100,000 years ago.  And, from this Adam and Eve, our shared ancestry goes much further back to the murky beginnings of evolution.  These are the facts and we should all speak explicitly about the occurrence of evolution and not allow evasive and misleading talk of the theory of evolution. <br />The point is that if we removed from extant religions those beliefs that are contrary to existing evidence it would go a long way towards the goal of an evidence based spirituality. <br />Sam Harris makes the point that \\". . . every religion preaches the truth of propositions for which no evidence is even conceivable.  This puts the 'leap' in Kierkegaards leap of faith\\".  Nevertheless , Harris admits that not all religions are equally bad in this regard.  The Bible has been dissected and analyzed far more ruthlessly than any other book in the history of mankind and this commendable state of affairs is singularly lacking in the case of the Koran.  It is little wonder that the current instantiation of Islam is highly dangerous in a world with weapons of mass destruction.  And it is little wonder that most Christians do not believe that  all Muslims need to be be converted or eliminated.   Most Muslims - even moderate ones - believe that the Koran is the literal word of God.  A much larger percentage of Christians believe no such thing with respect to the Bible. <br />Nevertheless Harris is correct in contending that moderate Christians and moderate Muslims are in many ways just as dangerous as the more fundamentalist ones.    The bare essentials of most religions are simply mutually contradictory.  Practising Christians believe (or are supposed to believe)  that Jesus and Jesus alone was a human instantiation of God and that salvation is through Jesus or not at all.   The Muslims believe that Mohammad superseded Jesus in being a channel for a more complete and accurate perception of Allah.  The Bahais believe that Baha-ullah superseded both Jesus and Mohammad in bringing a more complete and accurate revelation of God.  Those of the Jewish faith believe that neither Jesus nor Mohammad nor Baha-ullah were really needed since they were on the right track anyway in their worship of Jehovah.  And many Buddhists can be found in temples all around the world praying before a statue of Buddha as if he was/is some kind of demi-god. <br />All in all religious toleration is inclined to be phoney since such a collection of disparate and incompatible beliefs cannot all be true and every one of them must - with almost total certainty - be false. <br />In highlighting the flaws in Christianity, Islam and Judaism Harris seems to give insufficient emphasis on the flaws in communism (Marx, Lenin, Stalin), National socialism (Hitler) and Pol Pot's horrible reign of terror. It would seem that the absence of belief in the existence of God is, in and of itself, utterly useless when it comes to having faith in non-evidentiary distortions of reality.  Harris does speak of \\"political religion\\" when referring to Stalin and Mao but somewhat greater even handedness, in this regard, would not have come amiss. <br />Some comments on Harris' treatment of mysticism/spirituality would seem to be in order.  Harris points out that a mystical form of religion is more prevalent in Eastern rather than Western religions.  But he does not seem to recognize that different instantiations of mysticism vary significantly in their quality just as different religions and different subgroups in these religions vary enormously in the extent to which they are already focused on actual evidence for their religious beliefs and practises rather than blind faith. <br />Mahavira (one of the leading Eastern Mystics who was a key figure in the history of Jainism) spent twelve and half years meditating in a state of deprivation until he achieved \\"enlightenment\\".  His teaching was thereafter directed towards helping others to achieve freedom from \\"the cycle of birth, life, pain, misery and death, and achieve a permanently blissful state\\" (I quote from Wikipedia).  In the end - at the age of 72 -- he literally starved himself todeath. <br />In contrast to this Meister Eckhart, who was a Catholic mystic (posthumously excommunicated for his beliefs), and was certainly well aware of the possibility of blissful ecstasy writes as follows:  <br />\\"what a man takes in contemplation he must pour out in love.  If a man was in rapture such as Paul experienced and he knew a person who needed something of him, I think it would be far better out of love to leave the rapture and help the needy man.  It is better to feed the hungry than to see even such visions as Paul saw\\".    <br />The purpose of life cannot be simply to achieve happiness and/or enlightenment but rather to do something with our lives that makes the world a better place and brings happiness and fulfilment to others and not just to ourselves. <br />One final comment is probably worth making.  The percentage of Americans who reject the occurrence of evolution is far higher than it is in Europe, Australia, New Zealand or Canada.  This is almost certainly due to the appalling quality of the teaching of mathematics and science in American schools.  In a recent study by the Organization of for Economic Co-operation and Development America ranked 24th out of 29 countries examined.  I children received a better grounding in science they would undoubtedly be far less likely to end up in believing ideas which have no basis in reality.
1400032717|5.0|This book is both moving and insightful. Haddon aptly depicts a boy with autism who portrays his world through vivid anecdotes, math problems, and observation. True to his protagonist's mindset, Haddon weaves a story that begins as a mystery (who killed Wellington the dog) but evolves into a commentary regarding relationships, focusing mainly on trust. Christopher's parents are intersting characters in and of themselves; his father is a devoted fellow with a sensitive insight into Christopher's needs; the mother, a loving woman who chases love with a neighbor but is committed to her son in her own way. How Christopher comes to make sense of his world and deal with change is a fascinating and engaging story, quite different than most that are on the market. Highly original and definitely recommended.
6301223543|1.0|Based on a true story?  If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy.  Did anyone witness this woman being raped?  People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men.  They didn't have the DNA Test back then and when it did come about a lot of women were found guilty of lying about being raped.    Since when is it all right for anyone to take the law into their own hands?  I guess it was 1978 when it started for women or maybe before.  You would never say it was okay for a man to murder a woman no matter what she did to him.  This is sexist and sick.

B00005AQGH|5.0|This album is started off with the phrase \\"Suge shot him\\". Now I think that Suge Knight killed 2pac for the money. This is not 2pac's best album but it has amazing production (bomb First and Hail Mary). I'd still add The 7 day Theory to my collection though.
B00003CXCW|5.0|i had heard all the hype surrounding this film,sunset boulevard,and i must say that it definitely lives up to it.for me,many films that have been deemed classics have always been a disappointment. the older films are mostly too melodramtic for my tastes and always make me quince at the sight of corniness,still keeping in mind the time period.but this film,i must admit,is one of the all-time greats.the only thing close to bordering on melodrama and corniness to me was the scene between william holden and nancy olson when they express their love for one another,cue music.but that particular scene was not played out and did not hamper the movie in any way.it was great seeing buster keaton in a cameo,even if it was miniscule.jack webb from dragnet fame also stars in a bit part and cecil b. demille plays himself.william holden of course stars and plays his role admirably.but the most important thing about this film is gloria swanson who plays one of the most memorable performances in cinematic history.i'm sure we've all seen that classic scene with her coming at the camera with those evil looking eyes of hers.i can't recommend this film enough as it shows how hollywood treats their stars who at one time made lots of money for the studios,and what they do to them once they reach a certain age,and how much it effects those who are treated as disposable trash.sunset boulevard,as i said,is a classic that definitely lives up to the hype and will forever be a part of cinematic history.great film.

B000023X9W|5.0|Go read all of the reviews of Prairie Wind and then buy this record instead.  All of the superlatives applied by all of the critics to Prairie Wind are deserved instead by this collection of songs.  They are simple, heart felt, and beautiful. Their production is not overdone or underdone - its just right.  Everything you expect from one man, one guitar and one harmonica is here on Silver & Gold.  This, not Prairie Wind, is Neil's acoustic gem for the 21st century (so far).  Five stars easy.
B00005614N|5.0|WOW! My first impression when I heard the CD was pure pleasure. Gone with the old scratchy vinyl lp and on with the digital version. For Jazz lovers and musicologists, this CD represents the meeting of two of the most influential musicians of the 2oth Century. For those who simply love to hear Jazz when played by the best, well you will be hard pressed to find it played better. Louis Armstrong's All-Stars (along with Duke on piano) play for the sure pleasure of it and it comes across.
B00005JO0J|3.0|I watched the complete season of \\"Firefly\\" and was very impressed, so much so that I'll even try watching \\"Buffy\\".  The movie threw you right in the begining of some friction between characters that wasn't there at the end of the series.  Then some main characters die, so how does that allow for a \\"Firefly series 2\\".  One character was a mistery in the series and still remained a mistery after the movie. I feel like there's no hope of a second \\"Firefly\\" series after watching the movie.
B00004Y87O|2.0|I'll excuse the cheesy special effects, after all, it was 1981, (Like the paper airplane that was pushed off the top of the World Trade center by the inmates.} but what the hell happened to the plot?  <br /> <br />What an interesting concept, New York becoming a maximum security prison in the future, but a big problem I had was the fact that there was nothing in this movie that made me feel like they were in New York. After the opening sequence in which we saw a scale model of the city that was supposed to be an areal view, there wasn't a street sign or familiar landmark to be found.   <br /> <br />And where was the action in this \\"Action Movie\\"? A few mediocre chase scenes, a few punches thrown, and that was it. There was a lot of walking around with nothing happening. Also, I really don't see how this can be classified as sci-fi. <br /> <br />Kurt Russel was good, but the rest of the actors had no feeling whatsoever. Isaac Hayes was a big dude, but he didn't seem particularly menacing.  <br /> <br />I wish the plot would have been explored more. More background on the group that took over Airforce One. More info the tape and the documents that the president had in the briefcase. Even more about how the prisoners managed to cope while jailed on Manhattan Island. Then there was the abrupt ending. <br /> <br />I know I'm in the minority, but this movie sucked. I might have liked it back in 1981 when I was seven, but I sure don't like it now. Are all these raving reviews by people who saw the movie when it came out and are just nostalgic for something that seemed cool when they were kids?
0736646299|5.0|\\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is the rare book that puts a period of history into such clear focus that you will never look at it the same way again. The period of history we are talking about, though is the 1 million-year history of humans on planet Earth. Yes. the entire history of our species. In one book. Yes.<br /><br />Diamond's forte is laying out the broad patterns of human history. Starting with the appearance of humans in Africa a million years ago, he follows human expansion in Asia and Europe and the Americas. He describes the waves of extinction of large mammals coincident with (and he claims due to) the spread of humans into new areas. Diamond's view is macroscopic: on great movements of peoples, great developments of political sophistication, great tides of colonizations, great swaths of disease and technological advance. What emerges is an understanding of the patterns of history that is so profound, so commonsensical, that it is just scary. Diamond amazes by broadening his grasp of world-wide trends - focusing not only on Europe's recent history, but the on Middle East, Indonesia, Oceania, Australian and the Americas.<br /><br />The sub-theme of the book, the point that Diamond hammers home again and again is this: people are the same the world over; each group of humans being as smart, resourceful and vicious as any other. The differences of culture and technology and military outcomes are often (and I mean often!) due at their base to accidental geographical factors that provided some groups with enormous head starts (often in the many thousands of years) over other groups.<br /><br />Diamond presents evidence from archeology, genetics, linguistics, paleo-biology, botany and many other sciences  -- as well as his personal study of the people of New Guinea -- to make his points. His conclusions are strongly supportive of geographical determinism. Certain geographical configurations - such as the long East-West axis of Eurasia - are conducive to the spread of peoples, culture and technology. Being at similar same latitudes, Eurasians had an advantage when moving to other locales within the continent: similar climates allowed them to transplant crops developed in one location to others. Contract this with the Americas, where a crop, like maize, domesticated in South America's temperate zone could not survive in the Central American jungles, and so could not spread easily to North America.<br /><br />Diamond devotes separate chapters to the rise of domesticate crops and domesticated animals, describes clearly concisely why some crops and animals are easily domesticable while others are not. He shows that practically every domesticable crop on the planet was domesticated in pre-history, demonstrating convincingly that poorer continents were not so by dint of their dim-witted or incurious inhabitants. He then ably demonstrates the rather disturbing fact of the lopsided distribution of domesticable plants and livestock over the planet. Eurasia, by happenstance, was blessed with most of the domesticable plants and animals, far more than the Americas (where early peoples likely wiped out all large mammals) and far, far more than Australia. Africa, with its overabundance of large mammals, is nevertheless impoverished in terms of native *domesticable* animals, a fact that left that continent far behind in its ability to produce food via means other than human muscle power.<br /><br />Diamond's chapters on the development of writing are fascinating, as are his description of the way complex political systems were developed to handle the ever-larger human populations sustainable by ever-increasing food supplies. Diamond's view is that all political systems are to one degree or another kleptocracies, giving back to its members and giving only part of what it takes from them. And forthrightly describes the role that organized religions use to legitimize rulers and their practices.<br /><br />Diamond takes dead aim at the supposed superiority of European culture as the main cause of Europe's success at subjugating the Americas. But this is no bleeding heart apologia on behalf of native Americans. Diamond describes in horrifying detail how European germs (bred in cities which were the perfect breeding ground for successive plagues of such nasty bugs) rendered the conquerors so terrible. Regardless of the intentions of the invaders, Diamond claims, 95% of the 20 million natives of the America would have succumbed to diseases like smallpox, typhus and measles. By the time Hernando De Soto explored the Mississippi in 1540, the vast Indian empires of central North America had been completely depopulated by disease. It was disease and that unknown weapon of war, the horse, that allowed Fransisco Pizzaro to rout 80,000 Inca warriors using only 168 horsemen and soldiers. The Conquest was not, as Pizzaro liked to think, due to the superiority of the Spanish, or of God's will.<br /><br />As a religious person, this last fact is difficult to deal with. One may choose to see God's will in the endless exterminations, plagues and uneven distribution of food and animal stocks that drove much of human movement for the last million years. However, I personally find this view hard to stomach. How can God be considered \\"provident\\" when he provides so differently to people in different parts of his Creation? Diamond's description of religions as legitimizing political kleptocracies was not a welcome message, but one that certainly resonated. It is not only in Islamic countries that religion and politics mingle in unseemly union.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is an important contribution of the understanding of our collective human history. Imbued with equivalent intelligence and abilities, the lives of all human being are nevertheless determined to a large degree by our environment. *Where* we are born matters more than *to whom* we are born.<br /><br />A note about the cassette edition (which is no longer available for purchase): Doug Ordunio did a terrific job (over the course of 11 cassettes!) of rendering Diamond's tight and straightforward prose into a pleasant and informative listening experience.t the supposed superiority of European culture as the main cause of Europe's success at subjugating the Americas.

6305949980|5.0|This movie, directed by Henry Selick and written by Tim Burton, is absolutely delightful. I recommend it for children, teens and adults with lots of imagination, who believe they are prepared to watch a different and sensibly darker take on Christmas.<br /><br />The main premise is that, whether we know it or not, all holidays are planned in advance in diverse special towns. \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" takes place in one of those towns, Halloweentown, that is the place where Halloween is planned each year. Te main responsible of that planning is Jack Skellington, also called the King of Halloween. However, not many know that Jack is bored to death of always doing the same thing. Jack knows he is missing something, but has no idea whatsoever of what that is. Of course, everything changes when Jack discovers Christmastown, the town where (of course) Christmas is planned. For Jack, Christmas is something totally new, and foreign. All the same, he falls in love with it, and has a \\"brilliant\\" idea: to kidnap Santa Claus, and to hijack Christmas.<br /><br />Needless to say, things don't go smoothly, but that is a big part of the fun of watching this movie. Confusions abound when Jack and all his friends of Halloweentown try to plan Christmas for the very first time, and the result is extremely entertaining. That is specially true if you are bored of classic Christmas films that end up saying the same things all over again. This is certainly not the case in this animated film :)<br /><br />All in all, I think you are highly likely to enjoy this movie. Notwithstanding that, I don't recommend \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" for young children, due to the fact that some of the scenes might scare them a little. Having said that, I think that this film is a treat you are going to enjoy, and thus I highly recommend it...<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B00005JO0J|5.0|This movie is called \\"sci-fi\\" since it features a space ship and another galaxy.  This is much too narrow of a category for this wonderful film!  It's also an incredible drama, a comedy, an action-adventure (ala Indiana Jones), a Western, a samurai movie, and a humanitarian one as well.  No kidding, if you look hard enough you can find all these layers and more!  I just want to watch it over and over and over again - and I keep seeing new things and nuances.  It definitely helps to have seen the Firefly series before hand, but it does not hurt if you haven't.  But I'm warning you now that it will make you WANT to see the series, so save your money for the boxed set of Firefly as well :)

B00005JODA|5.0|\\"The Constant Gardener\\" was my 3rd choice (out of 3) of movies I wanted to see this weekend. What a pleasant surprise to find it so charming and realistic!<br /><br />Simply told, Justin Quayle, a soft-spoken a British diplomat and his politically radical wife, Tessa, are living in Kenya. Quite quickly, Tessa and a black companion are found dead near a remote lake. Hints of an adulterous relationship between the two are floated, but soon fall apart. The movie deals with Justin trying to understand the circumstances of his wife's death, which revolve around her off-hours activities which she kept private.<br /><br />The plot eventually involves foreign drug cartels, political favoritism, local corruption, AIDS, international aid organizations and greed. Ground up between these competing forces are the destitute of Africa, trying to survive in the midst of poverty and disease.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Wiesz bring ample humanity and believable depth to the Quayles, portraying their tenderness and devotion to one another. The rest of the cast and the writers make this one of the most intelligent movies of many a year. The cinematography of Kenya is stunning. Much of the film's personal scenes were shot by handheld cameras. At critical moments, though, shooting switched to an impressionistic flurry of shots and angles. The shanty-town misery of the Kenyan people was shown unsparingly but with sensitivity and compassion. The sound track, much of which is inspired by African music is achingly beautiful. Throughout, the film holds up the beauty, grace, dignity and long-suffering of the African people. They are not shown as faceless victims of white man's greed, but of noble human people caught up in forces larger than themselves.<br /><br />A beautiful and well-crafted film!

0684833395|5.0|this is the greatest book i've ever read in my whole life. true, i'm only 16-years-old, but i'm a pretty avid reader and so i'm saying it anyway: never before have i felt the way i do about this book and i don't imagine i will again any time too soon.    catch-22, as everyone has probably read for the other 700+ reveiws, is a bitting anti-war satire which makes you laugh, tear up and go out-of-your-mind frustarated at the pure ludicrousy of some of the situations until you think you're going crazy. one thing you'll never be, though, is bored. this book holds your attention from start to finish as it takes you on it's overwhelming ride.    my favorite thing about it would have to be the characters. yossarian, the protagonist who is scared to death to die, is one of most oddly loveable i've read. his insight, creativity and human-ness(?), combinded with his zanny, nuerotic fears, let anyone in their right mind relate instantly. in yossarian's predictiment (he flies over 70 missions) i just hope i'd be as crafty as he proves to be. there's also the sweet natured chaplain, the innocent Nately, the frank Dunbar, the abused major major major major, enterprizing milo and an assortment of insane generals, lutenients and colnels.    my advice to all of you: just read it. please. i can't imagine you'll regret it.
B00005JNQA|2.0|The Interpreter is a story of a UN interpreter played by Nicole Kidman (who is very boring in her role and has no life) who hears an assisanation atempt on a African leader. Sean Penn( who is very borng) is investagating the plot. The movie has a good idea and is very smart and intelegent at times butt he satory drags on and on and on. the movie tries to be a suspens film but it dosent work there is only maybe 3 parts that are good. The movie started out good but went downhill fast. Overall the performances where bad and I love Nicole Kidman but this time she did not turn out good and the story was slow.
0767903862|5.0|This book was so funny that I laughed out loud when reading it!  My husband overheard me laughing, & asked what I was reading that was so funny.  From that time on, when I put the book down, he picked it up & read.  We want to vacation in Australia sometime in the future, & plan to use this book as a travel guide.  I recommend it if you enjoy quirky books!
0385121679|5.0|Forget for a moment that The Shining is one of the greatest horror novels ever written, the inspiration for a classic movie and a fine TV miniseries, a scary, scary tale of a haunted hotel, and a fun piece of work by the Charles Dickens of our time. What is often forgotten about Stephen King's best book is that nowhere else in fiction is an alcoholic portrayed more realistically, and nowhere else is life for those who love that alcoholic shown with such gutsy, poignant, dead-on, hideous perfection. Those facts and those characters wed with a spectacular story of ghosts and evil, and that is why The Shining will outlive its contemporaries and still be read in a thousand years. The characters here live and breathe within our minds.<br /><br />Ten-thousand \\"serious\\" writers in more literary fields WISH they had the skill Maine's greatest writer does. No matter what genre he is writing in on any given day, King is one of the best writers ever to tell a tale. So read The Shining for whatever reason you wish, it's too great a book not to make your introduction, but keep an eye open for what I said about its characters. The story of a family and alcoholism is what raises this eerie novel to levels of surpassing greatness.

B00005JM02|1.0|Why do so many children's movies have to be about essentially scary subjects?  I reject that.  I think that movies for children can and should be about things that aren't terrifying.<br /><br />This movie is from the point of view of a fish, and therefore when the \\"mother\\" is eaten by a shark (along with every single brother and sister) it becomes a story about the murder of your own mother, brothers and sisters.<br /><br />All I can say is ... WHAT THE HELL !!!!!!<br /><br />I don't understand why other people think this is a good children's movie.  What are you thinking?  This is depressing and terrifying.<br /><br />It's not that the script is creative.  It's not.  The only thing going for it is the beautiful undersea drawing.  Aside from that, it is nothing.  Take the rose colored glasses off.  This film is a lot of scary nothing, and I think there is something wrong with the people who praise it.<br /><br />What annoys me the most is that it is so formulaic, so non-creative, but then again, I expected that.  After all, it is made by Disney, and they consistently put out sub-par work these days.  We are no longer in the golden age of Disney.  We are in the commercial and non-creative age of Disney, when all they do is scare kids and give them the same trash over and over.<br /><br />Who really likes this stuff?  Are you kidding yourself or do you really enjoy this depressing uncreative movie?  Except for the artists, of course.  They are great.  Credit where credit is due.

B000B19BCG|5.0|This is another fantastic album from Supergrass.  Taken on its own I give it 5 stars.  However, it's not quite the kind of album I look forward to from them so it's not my favorite.  (My favorites are \\"I Should Coco,\\" \\"In It For The Money,\\" and \\"Life On Other Planets.\\")  I prefer Supergrass' catchy fun pop songs, but this isn't that kind of album.  It's a top-notch album, don't get me wrong, I just sorta wish they'd released it under a different band name and also released an album or EP of stuff along the lines of \\"Grace\\" and \\"Pumpin' On Your Stereo.\\" <br /> <br />And by the way, if anyone from CAPITOL RECORDS is reading this: Please get off your butts and start publicizing these guys!  It's criminal that they're not as huge in the U.S. as they are elsewhere and it's only because you're not doing anything with them.  No one knows about them because they're not exposed to them; there's no media blitz like there is for your other acts.  You can start by making them more prominent on your slowwww, awful web site!

B00005JO0J|5.0|It's too dahm bad that the Academy never seriously considers handing an award for Best Film to a Sci Fi movie.  It's even more tragic that, due to the recent ineptitude of writers for both the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises, the vast majority of the moviegoing public will never even consider seeing what I believe is superlative cinematic storytelling in Serenity, writer/creator Joss Whedon's latest and best effort to date.   <br /> <br />For those of you who have seen last season's cancelled series Firefly (there's a sad tale in there all its own), this film is a splendid wrap-up, done with Joss Whedon's typical style and wit and an atypically luxurious budget for cinematography.  That's all I need say for you folks, but for those who haven't had the pleasure of getting to know Serenity's crew through the tv show, how to describe it...perhaps as a Space Western written for smart people?  No, that sounds snobbish, when I was only trying to make the point that the dialogue was more intelligent than what casual SF movie fans might have come to expect in recent years.   <br /> <br />Aw heck, here's all you need to know about Serenity:  a plot that involves lots of action, eye candy (in the form of great SFX, cinematography and good-looking actors), and classic human drama;  just enough humor to keep it from getting overwhelming; and the right amount of philosophy to ponder in the aftermath.   You can enjoy it whether you've ever watched Firefly or not, whether you care for megaSF like Star Wars or not, and whether you're in it for the characters or the fights.   <br /> <br />Bless you Joss...please keep `em coming. <br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle <br />
B0007N1AI6|3.0|As the first CD since Halford rejoined the band, this disc provides everything a classic Priest fan would expect, but nothing new.  Tipton's even taken to ripping himself off lyrically, borrowing bits and pieces of phrases and metaphors from his past work with the result that his songwriting is now cliche.  The best part is the DVD, which is an abridged version of the same exact show I saw Priest give at the Coors Amphitheatre in Denver in the Summer of 2005 (with Queensryche opening).  The opening act was back at the top of their game, with Geoff Tate's voice in fine form.  Halford was clearly having difficulty with the altitude, literally screaming some of the higher register vocals, vice using the power soprano that has become his trademark.  Also, the way Halford paced the stage he looked like a doddering old man still trying to rock.  If Priest is to be revitalized, Tipton needs to hand the songwriting chores over to Halford, and let Roy Z. produce their next album: in comparison to Halford's last solo outing before rejoining (\\"Crucible\\"), Priest's latest is background music, while Halford's last solo effort grabs you, shakes you, and excites you.  Personally, I think the last album with \\"Ripper\\" Owens, \\"Demolition\\", was a much more interesting and engaging HM album to listen to than this, regardless of what Priest purists think of it.
B00005JO0J|5.0|This movie will not change your life; there is no deep or meaningful message behind it.  As far as special effects, this movie had by no means a \\"star wars\\" budget and thus did not have the \\"star wars\\" special effects.  For the hardcore SciFi fans...This is *FAR* from the most realistic SciFi out there. <br /> <br />But if you can get past these aspects, this was, in my opinion, possibly the most entertaining movie I have ever seen.  The characters are dynamic and the plot is riviting and well paced.  Even if it isn't the most techincally advanced or high budget movie, it may well be the one I have had the most *FUN* watching.

I love reading about an artist's life, and King bares his to my complete satisfaction.  I admire the man and his writing immensely.  He is a phenomenon.  Not the world's best writer, but certainly the world's most readable writer.  And where's the shame in that?  And to think he did so much of pissed out of his gourd!  If I could have half his output accomplished in total sobriety I'd count myself a productive woman.

B000002UC5|5.0|In the spring of 1970, right after the demise of The Beatles (but before it had been made public), Paul McCartney recorded songs for what would be his debut album, simply titled \\"McCartney.\\" Recorded at his home studio, McCartney played all of the instruments and sang all lead vocals (Linda McCartney provided background harmonies on some of the songs.) The resulting album is a stripped-down, organic, serene collection of songs.<br /><br />Whereas John Lennon's first post-Beatles album \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" 1970, was a cathartic release of pent-up angst, McCartney began his solo career on a whisper instead of a bang. Compared to John Lennon's solo work, or The Beatles, there are no honest confessions, no social commentaries, no intricate arraignments to be found on \\"McCartney.\\"<br /><br />Upon its release in 1970, some people (including Lennon) were disappointed. Compared to any post \\"Revolver\\" (1966) Beatles album, or Lennon's masterpiece \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" \\"McCartney\\" may seem half-baked in contrast-as though the same amount of effort wasn't afforded to both the writing and recording process. I would have to disagree with this assessment. McCartney didn't set out to make a \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" part II. Perhaps not wanting to make a Beatles sounding album, McCartney set out to make something far less elaborate.<br /><br />In some ways the songs on this album sound more like ideas for songs as opposed to actual completed songs. It's as though \\"McCartney\\" were a collection of demos, only with a clear-crisp production. Only the near-finale \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" sounds like an actual completed song. What is considered \\"Filler\\" also surrounds each song.  Instrumentals or introductions lead into almost every actual song.<br /><br /> I don't mean any of this negatively at all, however, because the entire album works.<br /><br />None of this -the \\"filler,\\" the incompleteness of the compositions-is a drawback of the album. Everything on this album is essential to its overall flow. Even if it is \\"filler,\\" the \\"filler\\" sounds great and is the glue that holds the album together. Every piece on this album, whether it is a song, an instrumental, or \\"filler\\" is well written, melodic and instantly memorable. \\"McCartney\\" is sort of like a musical diary of what McCartney was doing at his home in the first few months of 1970.<br /><br />I like to listen to this album on the weekend. On a Saturday or Sunday morning, as the dawn brings on a new day and all is still, I'll lie down and put on \\"McCartney.\\" The slow pace and tranquility of the album is quite calming.<br /><br />While not brilliant like some of his other solo albums, The Beatles, or Lennon's solo work, \\"McCartney\\" has a unique charm of it's own.all flow.

B0009RCPY8|5.0|Amazon.com is great, right?  Of course they are.  I ordered this box set and recieved it right on time.  I'm old school (age 33)  no offence to anybody who think's it's not.  Well these movies are awesome.  Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd were kings of comedy back in the 80's.  Just a suggestion.  Imagine if they teamed up again for a Ghostbusters 3??  Of course with Harold Ramis.  In this day and age the special effects would be incredible.  The theaters would be PACKED with an audience, and I would guarantee they would be HUGE in the spotlight again.  If you happen to be a producer reading this at least put me in the credits.  Who You Gonna Call??  Hopefully me.
B000784WMW|5.0|This is my all time favorite version of Jane Eyre. I have seen all the rest, but this is by far the BEST!! I'll tell you why this is sooo good. It truly follows the book. Probably the only one out there that really does so. If there is another one, please let me know. I watch every adaptation and probably own most of them, but I always come back to this version. Every character, even the more complex plots of unknown family members (all three siblings are included in this version) every line (practically)is in this version. You really feel Jane's anguish as a child in a confusing adult world. You are saddened for her in the lonely drab Lowood. I felt and saw her frustration with certain teachers who only wanted to suppress her curious nature. I loved watching her growing affection for Thornfield hall and all that encompasses it. One of my very scenes in the version of Jane Eyre is done to perfection. I won't tell you because I'm working on spoilers. But, suffice it to say it is a very touching and intensely romantic scene. There are hundreds of reasons why I feel this version is superior to the others. Do yourself a HUGE favor and buy this on DVD! I also have the video cassette version and have waited patiently for this incredible movie to be transferred to DVD. The wait is over, sit back with a pot of tea and enjoy yourself!
B00005JO0J|5.0|\\"Serenity,\\" the long-awaited new movie written and directed by Josh Whedon, defies labeling.  It's not just sci-fi; it's not just a western; it's not JUST anything.  Except a really good movie.  Although devoted fans of the TV show \\"Firefly\\" already know and love the characters in this film, it is not necessary to have advance knowledge to enjoy the story, to understand what is happening in the plot, and to fall in love with the characters.  ALL of the characters.  Joss Whedon writes characters who are multi-layered...no-one is just a bad guy or a good guy.  Every character can be appreciated on many levels, as can the story.  No, there aren't any aliens...although there are some scary characters who live on the outer edge of nowhere...but there are real people, living in a real world, having an adventure that will leave you breathless and wanting more!

B000001GX8|5.0|For my money, this is one of the greatest 5 or 10 classical music recordings of all time.  Recording classical music is a hit-or-miss affair, because so many factors are involved.  Will performer X's contract allow him to record with performer Y and orchestra Z?  Were the performers having a good day?  Did someone's pasta fagioli (or is it schnitzel) go down wrong at lunch?  Did the engineer step on a microphone?  <br /> <br />To this, add the horrendous expense of a full vocal cast, orchestra, and venue, limiting the possibility of retakes.  You can't tell 100 musicians to \\"come back next week and try again\\".  Thus, for many compositions, there simply aren't great performances available, or even *good* performances.   <br /> <br />Figaro is no exception, despite the dozens of recordings with major operatic stars and top-notch conductors.  Almost without exception, they sacrifice Mozart's magnificant heart-rending music in the name of comedy. <br /> <br />In 1968, the stars suddenly aligned and gave us this magical performance of \\"Nozze di Figaro\\".  It has given me pleasure time and time again for the past 30 years, and I hope anyone reading this will give it a try.  (There is an excellent single-CD highlights verson available for those who perhaps do not love opera so much.)  I will say that there are many good recordings of Figaro for those who prefer comedy over music.  My taste runs to warmth and beauty;  those who would like a more comedic rendition of Figaro will want to look elsewhere. <br /> <br />Conductor - Karl Bohm is simply the best Mozart conductor of our generation.  Working with the Berlin Opera's adequate, but hardly estimable, orchestra, Bohm trades his baton for a wand. The musicians play like men and women possessed. While there are some instrumental weaknesses in the Overture, the orchestra shows enormous heart. <br /> <br />I have never quite understood why Mozart is so hard to play well.  His work is generally so technically easy that every 14-year-old piano prodigy will debut with a Mozart piano concerto (with uniformly nauseous results).  Yet, one can hardly find a good recording of Mozart instrumental music, much less a great one. <br /> <br />Bohm markedly accents the lyricism and elegance of Mozart's music rather than Beaumarchais' humor.  The tempi are on the slow side -- or, from my viewpoint, he wisely avoids the general error of suborning the music to the plot.  The music is never plodding, overly dramatic, or heavy.  Rather, Bohm plays the music musically, refusing to charge headlong through arias and vocal ensembles to get to the next dialogue.  Richness of tone is emphasized over technique. <br /> <br />The greatness of the performance lies in the performers' total trust of Bohm.  With the possible exception of Fischer-Dieskau (see below), all of the musicians, instrumental and vocal, seem absolutely confident in Bohm's musical leadership, resulting in a wonderful chemistry. <br /> <br />Gundula Janowitz -- what can you say about Janowitz? I just Googled \\"Gundula Janowitz cream* and got 1240 hits.  Her voice is exquisite on this recording, a captivating and expressive lyric tone with amazing volume and purity.  Schwarzkopf was excellent in the role, but unfortunately the recording technology available in her prime was much inferior. <br /> <br />Edith Mathis -- Mathis was a journeyman lyric soprano with a decent career in lieder and other German music (she was Swiss by birth).  I don't know if it was Bohm or Janowitz who inspired her, or if she was simply in the right place at the right time, but her Susanna was the performance of her life.  Her voice is perfectly matched with Janowitz' and she responded to the warm tone of the performace.  I cannot help but think that even people who prefer a more vivacious, up tempo, comic Figaro will have to admit that this Sull'Aria is one of the most moving pieces of music ever put to wax. <br /> <br />Tatiana Troyanos -- the third of the \\"three sopranos\\" (okay, she's a mezzo, and a fairly dark one at that) needs no introduction.  I have never heard a Stradavarius viola (he did make a few), but when I imagine one, I hear Troyanos.  She is in superb voice and is a perfect choice for the Bohm's lyricism.   <br /> <br />If you want to hear the difference between this interpretation and a \\"Figaro\\" served cold, just compare Troyanos' amber \\"Voi Che Sapete\\" to the glinting diamond of Frederica von Stade -- a fair test, since the technically superb von Stade is in excellent voice and has the benefit of better sound technology.  (You can hear enough of the aria from the Amazon.com samples to make a good comparison.) <br /> <br />Herman Prey -- I don't see how anyone could quibble with Prey's Figaro.  He plays the part with convincing humor, while showcasing his rich baritone.  It is hard to believe that he was 50 years old when this was recorded, as he retains both his midrange vocal richness and his high tessitura. <br /> <br />Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau -- The headliner is possibly the weakest link in the cast.  Fischer-Dieskau simply doesn't seem to have understood what Bohm was trying to do, or possibly was unable or unwilling to change his vocal style.  His vocal performance is certainly quite good, but compared to the other cast members (even those with less vocal talent), it is a bit uninspired and heavy-handed.  I suppose he is actually quite good;  he just doesn't live up to his billing.  And of all the cast, he is the most unable or unwilling to play up the Italian flavor. <br /> <br />The unmistakable German influence is possibly a drawback in general.  Troyanos, Prey and Bohm make the transition well.  (Actually, for the versatile Troyanos it isn't really a transition.) Janowitz and Mathis at least seem to be trying.  One could point out, though, that there is an odd irony:  Mozart pretending to be an Italian composer, performed by Germans pretending to be Italian musicians.  Of course, the opera is set in Spain,and from a French story, to boot :)  (I have always wondered about opera's fascination with Seville.) <br /> <br />To sum up, this is one of my favorite recordings of all time.  I would recommend it as a \\"must have\\" to anyone, connoisseur or opera neophyte.
1576751988|4.0|For a quick, snap-shot overview of goal setting techniques and concepts, \\"Eat That Frog\\" fits the bill very effectively. It's a fast read (or listen to, if you buy the audio CD) and very enjoyably written. If you want a more in-depth, step-by-step process of planning and attaining your goals through goal setting, I would recommend Brian Tracy's book or audio CDs entitled &lt;a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=BVUTKS8JH7XW&C=2MZE3AWOMYAIJ&T=C&U=/o/ASIN/157270358X/ref=cm%5Frev%5Femailcr%5Fp1%5Fc1154450%5Fdp%5F1%5Fh&H=1Zlcex8RQN2JZU84JtmA4TJzoecA\\">\\"Goals!: How to Get Everything You Want-Faster Than You Ever Thought Possible\\"&lt;/a>. \\"Eat That Frog\\" as a companion book can then serve as a periodic \\"refresher\\" of his most valuable concepts. <br />
B0006GAOBI|5.0|There are some who will attempt the cliched classification and categorization of this film's fans by calling them \\"delusional adolescents attracted to this movie due to their own shortcomings in society caused, according to them, because of their special gifts.\\" Such comments originate from cynical critics who spew out pseudo-intellectual statements, subconciously attempting to conform to a social standard in the face of something that their minds cannot understand. <br /> <br />This film is one of the most orignal ideas set in motion in the past two decades, so regardless of your philosophical convinctions, it will be an interesting and sobering experience. For myself, I watched Donnie Darko two times to grasp the principles that drive the plot. It possess a rare quality of absolute great music-to-scence integration, especially the director's cut. If you're not completely wrapped up in your worldly business, you can understand the director's purpose in Donnie Darko. Excellent, has the classic \\"sad-end, music\\" feeling also. Don't miss this one.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I loved this movie, but those only interested in constant superficial stimulation might find it dull.  The film starts in a kind of surreal, hellish high school a la \\"Heathers.\\"  The petty tyrants in the administration and cool caste maintain a rigid structure that allows no soul to breathe.  It's oppressive, and completely uncharasmatic kids like Napoleon and Pedro bear the brunt.  I don't want to ruin the end, but Napoleon unleashes his soul with the geek-funk without resorting to Columbine-style violence.  I was deeply moved by this idealistic film, which imagines that souls can reach through the oppressive confines of a rigid microcosm to genuinely touch others.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Seriously mishandled horror thriller that had some of its chips in the right place but lacks the showmanship to pull it off. Keanu Reeves is a charismatic actor but his performance here misses the mark completely and noises dives into a brick wall. His performance lacks the presence that the character needs to make this story fly and that's a dangerous thing considering the fact that he's the lead in the film. The story itself makes no sense what so ever and the direction by Frances Lawrence is amateurish to say the least. By hearing the audio commentary by him on the DVD is to here a filmmaker who knows that he was in way over his head in directing this film and it shows by his bad decision making and his clear misunderstanding on what the movie really needed by his lack of experience. He copies more than he originates and lacks the understanding to know how to incorporate what he copied. Another factor that made this movie fail is the screenplay, that had no idea on what it was trying to say. It says one thing and then does a complete 360 degrees and does something completely different. It tries to be intelligent but can't hide the fact that it's really trying to make a supernatural dirty harry film that lacks brains competence, and good writing. Its was supposed to be another Keanu Reeves franchise but unfortunately it makes the last two really bad matrix movies look like cinematic art. <br /> <br />There are some good performances in this film that does try to respect the audience, and that's manly from Rachel Weisz (The Shape of Things, The Constant Gardener) who gives the only real and strong performance in the entire film. Her performance is way too good for this film, that's how powerful an actress she is and it deserved better than this. The next good performance belongs to Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Brothers Grim) whose interpretation of the devil is pretty inventive but he's only in the last eight minutes in the film. <br /> <br />What a shame that this movie could not have been any better because it has some potential especially with the stellar performances of Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare but with a director who was in over his head and a screenplay that had no idea on what it was doing, it's no surprise on why this movie turn out this bad.  <br /> <br />

The man lives in the crowded materialistic enclave of Los Angeles (hard \\"g\\"), but he is completely above and beyond the petty striving of his neighbors.  This is how the boddhisatva lives.<br /><br />The plot follows the Dude (Jeff Bridges) and his bowling buddies Walter Sobchek (John Goodman), a preposterous, bloated vet with anger issues, and blank Donny (Steve Buscemi).  The plot is hilariously circuitous, following a pompous crippled fat cat, his manservant (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his porn star trophy wife (Tera Reid), the attempts to recover that wife and/or ransom money from a gang of nihilists, etc.  Great surreal scenes when the Dude trips, cool soundtrack too.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|After the two previous films there's not a lot of need to rehash another description of the plot or the characters.  After watching this it's easy to see that the seams dividing the three films are primarily there to provide logical breaks between the movies, not because they are needed.  This is really one very long film and several of the themes only come to fruition here.  It is time for the rebels to hunker down for the last defense of Zion and for Neo to quest for a solution that doesn't involve ending life entirely.<br /><br />Simple things first.  This film is a masterpiece of CGI, choreography, and stagecraft.  Not simply because there are a lot of detailed evil critters running around waving tentacles, but because the animators have taken great care to make sure that the critters work together flawlessly.  Battle scenes such as the defense of Zion are remarkable because of their vastness and the cruel beauty of the conflict.  And the fight work, especially the final grand conflict between Neo and Smith is equally compelling.  In the previous episode, I found the fighting a bit repetitious, but here everything is so under control that it appears effortless and natural.<br /><br />Another thing the Wachowski's do very well here is shift between realities so well that by the end one isn't quite sure which events are happening in what layer of perception.  Our only hints are when Neo starts talking to Trinity about The Light.  This affirms there is something beneath the surface, even if we aren't sure what it is.  It isn't really the machines on the other side of this struggle, it's Agent Smith who has become Neo's alter ego as bringer of the dark.  All of this forces the viewer to accept everything as real, which is exactly the right state for viewing.<br /><br />One of the layers of symbolism I found lurking in this film, unlike the pseudo-symbolism built up by the choices of names, is the steady, low-key series of Arthurian references.  Much like the story of the Once and Future King this the story of hope broken and then rebuilt on the bones of failure and tragedy.  It isn't until the ending sequences that Wachowski's take their gloves of and hit you over the head with Arthur/Neo, but it works quite well in context.<br /><br />Obviously I liked this film much better than Matrix Reloaded.  I'm not going to pretend that the film is a literary masterpiece, but it does a great job of demonstrating that action/adventure can be a lot more than brain numbing hack, kick, and slash.  Two hours of total escapism.  Yippee!tory of the Once and Future King this the story of hope broken and then rebuilt on the bones of failure and tragedy.

6305558167|5.0|John Boorman has always been of my favorite filmmakers. He possesses that absorbing faculty to involve the viewer from the first shot of any film. And once more he used all the available means to get an absolute and enjoyable version of the Arthurian legend, joining to Eric Rohmer and Robert Bresson who undertook in the Seventies similar projects with fruitful results. Boorman focuses on a very realistic perspective, the rise to power of King Arthur, the forbidden love of Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot and additionally special attention to the magic which confers the film, not only a sumptuous stage, but it plunges in the myth 's nucleus with absorbing and even hallucinating visions, enriching visually the unexplainable, the mythic force beneath the most important myth of the Western World.<br /><br />The impossibility to reach individual love 's concretion, when the natural law imposes over the made laws man.<br /><br />All the cast is overwhelming. Helen Mirren captured my entire attention from this moment. I love this actress and the time for her was shining which makes me glad. Liam Neeson 's film debut in screen.
0375834605|5.0|My five year old loved this book almost as much as I did.  It was very entertaining, and went pretty much along with the movie.
B00005JO0J|5.0|saw the movie and loved it but there were some discontinuites with the origional show. as most browncoats know in the pilot simon says that he picked up river in cryogenic stasis at the planet that he hitched a ride on serenity, but in the movie(other non-browncoat-only-seen-the-movie people dont whine this happens in the first minute of the movie so its not a spoiler) it has simon bail her out. othe than that i think almost everything else is just \\"shiny\\"
B000002UAC|5.0|This album is great. Some people dismiss it as one of their worst but don't listen to them. This album contains some of the Beatles best early records. <br />Songs like 'It Wont Be Long', 'All My Loving' and 'All Ive Got To Do' are classics. It's worth buying for those three alone. <br />Sure, there are a could of turkeys (George's first solo effort springs to mind) but they are small potatoes when you compare them to the others. Even the 'filler' is better than most peoples A-sides -- songs like 'I Wanna Be Your Man', for example - which the Rolling Stones took into the Top20. <br />This is definately their best album during the 'Yeah, Yeah, Yeah' period. Deep and meaningful it isn't, but as a great slice of happy, catchy pop it's hard to beat.
B00005A46T|4.0|Much as I loved other Nu Metal bands,I could'nt come to terms with this album until I got the incredible ¨Disasterpieces¨ DVD on which the songs from ¨Iowa¨are made justice both in performance and in sound quality.I really liked most songs on it with the exception of maybe 2-3 of the least known ones, which I regarded as filler. What is really striking about the album is the sheer hate it conveys, both lyrically and musically; it's kick in the teeth with a steel boot, and that I do relate to. The album closes with a 15' ¨instrumental¨ that is to die for. Dunno why people can't hear the bass guitar on this CD. I can and love it.<br /><br />The overall sound and mix though are a totally different animal. The sound is not very good but can be made to sound OK with a good stereo equipped with a big sub to enhance the lacking bottom end. Percussion is excessive and buries the excellent drumming on ocassions and that's a real pity. Guitars should have had a more jagged tone because they don't shred as they should, being buried in the mix sometimes. Vox is OK though.<br /><br />But...I find this to be a very original, ground-breaking album, not unlike Sex Pistols' Never Mind The Bollocks. It gave Nu-Metal the popularity it deserved at the beginning of the century and made me a fan of countless other bands of the genre.<br /><br />This is a totally love or hate affair, so buy at your own risk and disregard 5 and 1-2 stars reviews (enthusiasts and haters).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw the preview for the movie (Serenity) over the summer (of 2005) and I immediately ordered a copy of this cult show and figured it was time to see what all the fuss was about. I was glad to see that almost instantly I was rewarded for the risk on something I hadn't seen. <br /> <br />After the pilot episode, which takes awhile to get going and almost chokes under the pressure of setting everything up, is over the show gets out for a bit of fresh air and really takes off. Nathon Fillion is amazing as Captain Mal Reynolds, and has the wit and charm of Whedon's writing down pat. <br /> <br />The show is very humurous, and has a certain contagious charm. I found that I watched all 14 episodes in just a few days because the show is so addicting. Alot of small subplots are left dangling as the show was cancelled after just 14 episodes (actually less, but the set includes a few unaired episodes as well), but the new movie is the awesome series finale the show never got. It wraps up all the plot-lines and still leaves it open for more. <br /> <br />The characters are relatable, the writing is great, and the show is just top-notch. A real joy to watch over and over.
B0002IU988|5.0|Sure, we all love creed and we,re all sad they broke up BOO HOO, but after you listen to a few tracks on alter bridge's new album you'll say \\"wow, Creed never sounded THAT good!\\" I feel that creed was all about limitations like \\"don't play your guitar too good or keep the drum beat very simple.\\" With alter bridge it's more like \\"mark, you gotta do some serious shredding and Miles, man hit them HIGH notes\\". This album is essentialy just 4 guys that go all out with their voice and instruments and their songs reflect that in a very good way. This is one of the FEW cds that i can put in and listen to it all the way through with out ever hitting the skip button. i guess the only reason that you mite have for not liking this cd is that you have a disease that renders you unable to listen to good music.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|It was sad to witness Liam Clancy as a caricature of the drunken Irishman.His contribution was a negative.
B00005M91K|2.0|This is actually a five star film in terms of the quality of the production.  The only way I can describe it as sort of like an extremely well done National Geographic special without any narration and with an excellent soundtrack.  Why do I give it 2 stars then?  Because of the disgusting scenes of animal torture involving live little chicks (as in baby chickens).  I never got past these scenes which the director seems to fixate on.  It mars an otherwise beautiful movie.  Animal lovers beware, you will hurl this dvd across the room in disgust as I did.  It's too bad, its otherwise very good...
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was one of my favorite books as a child. Beautifully written and engaging, the narrative doesn't talk down to children or cover them with too much fluff. You really felt trepidation or excitement as the characters experienced their adventures.<br /><br />As an adult, I revisited the book with my own children and was very pleased to find it just as engaging to the \\"jaded\\" adult as it was when I was a kid. My children enjoy the story, which says something when books are up against video games and electronic gizmos.<br /><br />I would completely recommend this book and the entire series.

0440237688|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry deserves all the acclaim that it receives.  The Community and its rules and regulations are an imaginative way of viewing what society could become.  The Giver reminds us that uniqueness is a part of everyday life that everyone very much takes for granted.  It also stresses that the ability to love and cherish our families is also something we must never forget. However, in my opinion, The Giver is left a little unfinished.  Lowry does a wonderful job in describing the community and all of its events, but when it comes to the climax, I feel as though it kind of just leveled off.   My only criticism is the ending.  It definitely could have been more descriptive and informative as to what happened to the Community.  I did enjoy reading it though, and I do feel that it is a good book to use in a classroom environment.  It leaves many opportunities for discussion and debate.  It is conceivable that that was Lowry's exact intention:  to spark discussions over the ending and the many controversial topics within the story itself.   <br />     If one was looking for a higher level book that is very closely related with this I would have to say Brave New World by Adolus Huxley.  It is the mature, adult version of The Giver in its questioning of future societies and its regard to love, family, and memory. <br />
B0008ENHTE|3.0|great film !! love the mustang...this is how police films should be
B00005JO0J|5.0|Awesome, awesome, awesome.  It's about time that Mr. Whedon actually got to direct a movie he wrote, and it was obviously in the best of hands. <br />His motto should be: I don't ask anyone to do what I'm not willing to do myself, but if I can do it better, I won't trust it to anyone else. <br />Excellent acting.  Whedonesque writing and directing at its usual best. <br />Moreover, it is the only movie that my husband and I have laughed simultaneously through.  So thanks very much to everyone involved for bringing out our synchronicity.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|Yet another side project by Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme. This time he takes the drum seat for this great album.<br /><br />The Eagles of Death Metal, are not claiming to \\"reinvent the wheel\\" of rock n roll, it is just a straight up danceable, fun, fast and energetic blend of distorted guitar and drums.<br /><br />It is a lot more digestable and a lot easier to get into than any of previous QOTSA or Kyuss albums. You will like this record from the first opening riff. Great rock for partying.<br /><br />Cheers
B00005JMAH|4.0|I believe that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a pretty good movie.  It's not a great Harry Potter Movie but in General it is a great movie overall. <br /> <br />1. The Acting is pretty well done <br />2.It has beautiful camera shots <br />3.It is well directed despite not following the book. <br />4.It is growing up with the generation who first read the book. <br /> <br />It is much more dark and I think that that was a good idea on the part of the director because when the series started the kids that were reading were about 8 and on. When the movie came out in 2001 the kids were older.  Now at about 16 and up we expect more maturity from the movies.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|unless you are the typical american that needs death, explosions and sex in every frame, you will love this film. <br /> <br />watch, rewind, repeat. if you only see it once, you may still be confused as to why Vincent Gallo chose the style that he did. though everything is not spelled out for you, there are subtle hints to Buds madness. each woman has her meaning, each frame has its, and so does each word. <br /> <br />the cinematography was outstanding. it is the film i would create, if i were a filmmaker.

B00005K9LN|5.0|Judas Priest accomplished the best of both worlds for heavy metal in the spring of 1980. They created a great album that was as heavy as it was commercial. Continuing the experiment of recording shorter, punchier songs that would appeal to a more mainstream rock audience that was started on 'Hell Bent for Leather', 'British Steel' represents the band at its peak for may fans and casual listeners. The original running order for the UK release opens with \\"Rapid Fire\\", from which the title of this review comes and serves notice right off the bat that Priest would deliver the goods in thrashing, bashing fashion. \\"Stealer\\", \\"Grinder\\" and \\"The Rage\\" continue the onslaught and lyrically and musically remain the more complex tunes on this disc. New drummer Dave Holland and producer Tom Allom help create the piledriving sound that Priest may have lacked in the '70's. 'British Steel''s most famous songs are of course the hits, heavy metal and pop, very well combined. \\"Breaking the Law\\", a classic though simple tale of desperate acts by desperate men (dumb video though); \\"Living After Midnight\\", Priest's \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" though I have yet to hear this at a wedding (thank God!); \\"Metal Gods\\", where Halford gets his well known sobriquet (and a continuing theme for Priest, Sci-fi); and \\"United\\" a \\"Take on the World\\" style anthem, though not as good as that song (my humble opinion anyway). Some people feel this LP spelled the beginning of the end for Priest as a serious metal band because of the over commercial, dumbing down quality which followed as later cartoon characters as \\"Screaming\\", \\"Defenders\\" and \\"Turbo\\" would testify. Much like \\"Hell Bent\\", this record will always be a special one for me and much better than records that would soon follow into the new decade, ironically one that Priest's descendents would rule. \\"Red White and Blue\\" is okay (again a leftover from \\"Turbo\\" obviously and \\"Grinder\\" live are the two bonuses on this reissue, with more to follow. Priest were now striving for commericial success but their creativity would soon suffer.
B000002TP7|3.0|This is easily one of their more popular albums, but probably the one I listen to the least. It doesn't flow well to my ears, and just never hooked me. Front to back \\"Check Your Head\\" is way better, and even \\"Hello Nasty\\" I like more. This does of course have the huge hit \\"Sabotage\\", but some of the rest is filler, and even \\"Sure Shot\\" and \\"Root Down\\" I never like that much. Even the cover is kind of lame. Still, there's a few gems. I'd get any other Beastie Boys album first, and if you're just looking for \\"Sabotage\\", \\"Root Down\\", and \\"Sure Shot\\", those are on the upcoming \\"Solid Gold Hits\\" collection.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|For the record, this is absolutely NOT the first time Sigur Ros has sung in Icelandic.  The entirety of Agaetis Byrjun with the exception of \\"Olsen Olsen\\" is sung in Icelandic, and the lyrics are readily obtainable on the web.<br /><br />After the stark and austere ( )album, Takk finds Sigur Ros returning to the warmer ambience of Agaetis Byrjun.  The band's epic, cinematic and highly orchestrated sound focuses on loud/soft dynamics with high-pitched vocals used more as an instrument than a typical vocal.  Sigur Ros is one band that instinctively understands how to appropriately integrate an orchestra with a rock band.  Rather than a \\"let's be really artsy and throw a bunch of violins on our album\\" approach, Sigur Ros takes the time to match the orchestration to the piece (one hesitates to call what this band does \\"songs\\") in a wholly organic manner.<br /><br />Takk doesn't really break any new ground at all, in fact if anything I find it a bit of a retreat, but the group's fans will definitely be pleased by this latest offering.
B000002LRX|5.0|After 1988's commercially successful The Real Thing introduced the crazed genius of Mike Patton to the world, Faith No More's future seemed set in stone. What followed in '92 was a dark, dense, and creative album that pretty much slammed the door shut on their MTV prospects, and we're all the better for it.<br /><br />First off, don't be fooled by those saying that Angel Dust is difficult or inaccessible (leave sobriquets like that to latter Patton projects like Fantomas or his collaborations with John Zorn). No, this is for the most part VERY accessible, VERY tuneful, and just all-around great. However, it achieves all of these things without an iota of artistic compromise.<br /><br />Angel Dust represents the point where Patton's true abilities are revealed--on The Real Thing his vocal talent and immense range were hinted at, but often inhibited by a whiny, nasal quality (attributed perhaps to the fact that the songs on that album were written for Chuck Mosely, Faith No More's original vocalist, who had a very different voice from Patton's). However, on Angel Dust Patton truly cuts loose. Lounge-singer croons, vicious snarls, white-trash mumbling (as featured on RV), rapping, a creepy baritone, screams--you won't believe it all emanates from one man's voicebox. One of my favorite vocalists of all time, Patton's prescence as a frontman can firmly reduce all but the most talented bands to supporting players in The Mike Patton Show.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the rest of Faith No More's (guitarist Jim Martin, bassist Billy Gould, drummer Mike Bordin, keyboardist Roddy Bottom) talents aren't evident. The band has never played better here, in the alternative/funk-rock, bass-and-synth dominated style that made them so different from most of their guitar-oriented contemporaries--this time with a darker, more demented bent, all the better to accentuate the equally demented lyrics.<br /><br />Opener Land Of Sunshine combines fortune-cookie phrases with bizarre laughter and moody bass--we're not in Kansas anymore. This is followed by the stream-of-consciousness rant Caffiene; the impossibly catchy Midlife Crisis (possibly the most radio-friendly song on the album); the goofy redneck raving of RV; the grindy funk-metal tune Smaller And Smaller (with an out-of-left field tribal breakdown that totally makes the song); the ominous and evil Malpractice; a hilariously perverted ode to oral sex with cheerleader chants in Be Aggressive (justifying the Parental Advisory sticker); the absolutely insane Jizzlobber with its wacked-out church organ; and a baffling rendition of the Midnight Cowboy theme to close the album out on a relaxing note.<br /><br />Not a single note wasted here. Easily Faith No More's best, and an essential component to any aspiring Pattonphile's collection.ith bizarre laughter and moody bass--we're not in Kansas anymore.

B000069AUI|1.0|My dear friend, Kenny has perfectly described this band and why they suck. Everyone in this band sucks. Only Limp Bizkit are worse than Coldplay. I mean, how can people listen to this overrated, lame and incredibly dull music?? This they sound different from any other band on MTV doesn't make them any better. I mean, okay if you want something chilling (for the matter check out Depeche Mode), but man, this is just mindnumbing! They're also completely unoriginal, they ripped off Radiohead and won a grammy for the song. The only good thing here  is the piano in 'Clocks' although the song itself is insanely boring. And Chris Martin's vocals are just plain horrible. I hear people saying his voice is beautiful. Simply unbelievable. Want a good singer? Check out Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden), Rob Halford (Judas Priest) or Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth). Even Chester Bennington from Linkin Park is better than Chris!    Don't buy this. Unless you have insomia and don't wanna take pills, not for any other use (especially while drivng or operating a heavy machine).     DEATH TO COLDPLAY!!!
B00007L4OM|4.0|Jean Reno stars as Hubert, an ex-intelligence officer who is now a cop in Paris. Basically, Hubert lives and breathes his job, has no life, and the only relaxation he gets is playing golf every Sunday. Then he gets a call from Tokyo. It seems Huberts old flame has died suddenly and left him everything in her will.....and the 19 year old daughter he didn't know about...and some trouble with the yakuza.  <br /> <br />If your looking for something deep and meaningful then look somewhere else. But if your looking for an enjoyable bit of fun to kill a rainy afternoon then look no further. Jean Reno is his always watchable self and I have to admit he looks GREAT in this movie. And I have admit that the daughter wasn't as bratty as she could have been. And kudos to the fellow who played Momo, he was pretty funny. All in all, a harmless bit of fluff. Enjoy!

B000022TSW|5.0|Just about the entire film is mass hysteria.  I must say that the musical aspect of the film is weak, but the lyrics are not.  The lyrics are so funny and burning I think that's why \\"Blame Canada\\" got the nomination.  Other than that some of the other songs were quite funny as well.  I think Terrance and Phillip's song was extremely funny because it displayed a type of infectiousness that is rarely seen in film today.  The anti-profanity song was also extremely funny and no less infectious.  One quality about the film that really caught me as I was watching it was the feeling of nonstop behavior and jokes.  I was repeatedly watching the elapsed time on my DVD player to see how far it was into the movie because no matter how long into the film it got, the film felt like it was just a longer episode of the show and I kept on feeling as if I knew where the commercial breaks should be, if you know what I mean.  Feature length films need room to breath so that the audience can recover, for TV there are commercials and films need resting places.  This film has no such spots and as such the film is on the extremely short feature side which works in it's favor since there really are few, if no other films of this kind (subversive and relentless animated features that are short).  Before I end this review I must give a credit to Trey Parker for writing the song sung at the end by Michael McDonald over the credits.  As I was listening to it, I thought that one of the South Park guys was doing an imitation only to learn through the credits that it was actually him singing. Therefore, I must also give credit to Michael McDonald for singing it.  It seems totally out of place because it's adult contemporary R&B (think usual Michael McDonald stuff)and then you get to the chorus and the line is \\"Life is kind of gay, but it doesn't seem that way through the eyes of a child.\\"  After the first chorus the jokes start to pile up, but it's just nice to see McDonald lampooning his image for the sake of this film, which is hilarious in it's own right.  My favorite moment in the entire film is the scene where Kyle Asks Chef what it takes to get a girl to like him and Chef, how shall I say it, messes it up.  If you can't stand rampant vulgarity and permeating profanity, than stay away from this film because it's one of the greatest films of that kind.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I didn't like this album for a while, but after seeing them live and repeated listens, it's grown on me. Still, the middle of te album (tracks 6-8 and maybe 9) is undeniably weak, and for me it distorts what is a great collection of songs. Favs: White Shadows, Fix You, Twisted Logic.
0060872675|2.0|An attractively illustrated children's book, 'Where's My Cow?' is entertaining, but I fear that its appeal will largely be limited to people familiar with Pratchett's Discworld humorous fantasy novels.  The books is tied in with Pratchett's latest Discworld gem, 'Thud!' in which we learn that Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh Morpork Watch must hurry home every night by 6 to read his 14 month old son, young Sam, his favorite book, coincidentally titled 'Where's My Cow?'.  This fictional children's book is depicted as being similar to 'Are You My Mother?' by PD Eastman, in that it follows that tried and true formula of 'Is this what I was looking for?  No, this is a ______, this is not what I was looking for,' and so on.  The actual real world book 'Where's My Cow', however attempts to combine the fictional book with events in the grown-up novel 'Thud!', and this is where things get odd.     <br />There's plenty of Discworld references to keep readers of these novels grinning, but these elements would prove confusing to a young person, having of course never read a Discworld novel, and to adults looking for a nice book to buy for a youngster.  I think they tried to have their cake and eat it too with this book, meaning satisfy long-time Discworld fans, while providing an entertaining read for children. Unfortunately, the disparate ages of Discworld novel fans and children means much about the book would be confusing to the younger reader.  They should have kept the book non-Discworld except in flavor and imagery (the swamp dragon present on every page is a very nice touch, for example).  One would have to read the novels to understand much of the text in this book, and so, as a children's book, it fails, despite its wonderful artwork.
B00012L786|4.0|Director Sam Fuller operating in the midst of the Cold War with a low budget comes up a tad short in his film noir crime drama \\"Pickup on South Street\\".  While the camera work and sordid settings in Lower Manhattan greatly add to the viewing quality of the film the interrelationship between characters were an unbelievable fairy tale.<br /><br />Wise aleck pickpocket and three time loser Skip McCoy played by Richard Widmark pinches the wallet of attractive bad girl Candy played by Jean Peters on the New York subway.  Little do they both know but she's been acting as a mule for her ex-boyfriend Joey played by Richard Kiley, carrying a sensitive piece of microfilm containing a secret chemical formula.  She unwittingly was delivering it to a group of Communists.  Unknown to both characters the theft was observed by federal agents who had been shadowing Peters.<br /><br />The plot essentially involves the coaxing of Widmark to relinquish control of the microfilm by both the authorities and the minions behind Peters and her red sympathizing boyfriend.<br /><br />The cops use tie saleswoman and stool pigeon Moe Williams played in a terrific acting performance by the accomplished Thelma Ritter to ferret out the whereabouts of Widmark.  Widmark however realizing that he's stolen something valuable is holding out for a big score.  The feds try to wave the flag at him to get him to cooperate to no avail.  Slightly tarnished Peters falls for Widmark in an implausible sequence where she unsuccessfully tries using her charms to woo him and recover the film.<br /><br />Fuller seems undecided whether to make his film an anti-Communist piece or a crime drama and winds up falling short in both areas in terms of impact.  The characters created by Fuller were for the most part universally unlikeable with too may issues to be considered protagonists.  The acting performances most notably by Ritter were well played.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I happened upon Firefly playing on the Sci-Fi channel as a run-up to the movie.  There was clearly good chemistry among the actors.  Each character had a very distinct personality and agenda.  Seeing the backgrounds fleshed out further in \\"Out of Gas\\" made it both touching and my favorite episode.  It's sad that there wasn't better publicity of this when it *was* on because Firefly is a gem.  Long story telling, clever dialogue and multiple story arcs only to  end up cancelled.  That seem right to you?
B00003CWTI|2.0|This movie was not for me.  I felt it lacked plot, depth, and any sort of ability to entertain or capture an audience.  There is symbolism through out the movie, but you have to be looking for it and know what it is when you see.  At best this is a rental, but only if you really, really want to see it.  Otherwise, I say pass.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The plot is now well-known, even with the spoilers here... however, I just have to join in with all the voices saying, SEE THIS MINI-SERIES.  If you are a Masterpiece Theatre, Anglophile or A&E fan, this is your cup of tea... trust me.<br /><br />Goes without saying that Richard Armitage is brilliant in this movie, however, so is the rest of the cast in my opinion.  Actually, the only one I thought lacking was Daniella Denby-Ashe.  She, I thought, just missed.  But it doesn't matter, this is still worth watching over and over.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I have to be honest. This movie was great, full of action and just enough drama to keep it the tragic story it is supposed to be. One of the better historical films I have witnessed...but there is a problem. This story was supposed to be more centered on the two lovers, Paris and Helen, and it wasn't. No they centered more on Achilles, Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt is the bigger actor, so they of course wanted him to stay in the spotlight, and Brad Pitt did very well as Achilles. But I felt they should have made the situation between Paris and Helen more in the center of everything, since they are the ones who started this whole story. You see a lot more of Achilles and Hector though than Paris and Helen, and although like I said it makes it a very fascinating film, I still have to shave off a star because one of the things I wanted to see more of was this Paris and Helen situation more strongly than it was. Matter of fact they strengthened more on the relationship of Achilles and his eventual lover in the film than Paris and Helen.   Yet I cannot hate this film. It was as I said exciting and the characters that played this film supported the movie. It is definitely one of the better films I have seen historically and I love how they played out the movie. I just wish they would have stayed focused a little better on Paris and Helen. Yet Brad Pitt made it a film to enjoy with him as the centerfold.    I recommend this film over Gladiator, King Arthur, and Alexander. Troy is a lot more exciting of a film than any of these others. That's my opinion at least.
0393317552|5.0|I have been looking forward to receiving this book! Now that it has arrived in good time -- and as promised I'm happy to enjoy reading it! Thanks!
B0009QTS1M|3.0|Truly it wasn't. My friend and I watched the film and we were expecting a lot more excitement than there was. My friend was right there was way too much dramatics and not enough action and the acting in itself was kind of lame in parts. Russell Crowe is a very wooden actor to me. It's like he had one face on the whole time in the film and I was thinking what is he truly feeling right here- is he mad, sad, worried? Russell is not the best actor again the wooden performance he gave turned me off from the passion that the film should have been leaking out. And every leading actress is always trying to find justice and also wants something extra from the man who is supposed to bring this justice- I mean that is getting so cliche and I didn't like watching that same old material in this film. Couldn't the Ceaser's sister just want to save her home without any romantic feelings involved? I mean honestly. That is kind of stereotypical and it gets old. Braveheart did the same thing and I think these romances are rushed and honestly there is no time for them. Like I said, the drama was overdone and there wasn't enough action.  <br />The only interesting parts were where Russell was standing ready to fight. The tiger scene was particuarly interesting and the woman with the arrows. Then at the very end with the very last fight scene. And these interesting parts hardly took long to finish, and then once more they went back to the dramatics. I don't know, maybe I'm too picky, but I have seen better historic films and this definitely is a mere average historic film. It was nothing breakthrough except for the plot, which didn't carry out too well. With a few more fight scenes, and a few snip snips to the overfilled drama and a cut out of the romance between the ceaser's sister and Russell- it doesn't work at all in that film- I don't think this film wouldn't have been bad. What historical film- makers need to know is that when we watch swords and armor we expect to see that a lotof the time, and when their armor comes off then they better have a good and interesting reason for it that keeps the movie going into more exciting scenes instead of lazing off into dramatics we could care less about and further just bore us. Just a pinch of drama and plenty of fight scenes is what a historical film is- I think people don't get that at this present time and that is why I am constantly bogged down with drama- fillers like Alexander that I am fooled in thinking will actually be an exciting action film. <br /> <br />Remember people- critics love drama. So when a historical movie gets awards, think about it twice first.
B00001U0CP|5.0|Once again Patricia Cornwell does not dissapoint her avid reading fans with \\"Unnatural Exposure\\". This is the second time I have read all of her novels except the latest one that just came out in 2005. I turned 50 this year and treated myself to all of her collection in hardback. I have to honestly say she is my favorite writer...hands down. This novel just like any of hers is facinatingly detailed with forensic discoveries about medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta's,fast paced life in her Virginia hometown. Not only do you visualize the crime detail through her writing, you are also treated to a glimpse into her home, and her Italian heritage.  <br /> <br />Can't get enough,  <br /> <br />Maggie
B000AMPZF8|5.0|This album was FINALLY released in the U.S.  And I'm very excited to see it hit the states.  Why?  Because in my opinion this is Muse's best album artistically.  Sure it's not as poppy as Absolution, or as \\"diamond in the rough\\" as the first, but I think Origin of Symmetry is Muse's most artistically complex and rich work.   <br />The songs may take a few listens, but nearly every single one is a gem that fits a certain mood.  Matt Bellamy's voice often finds itself in a stratosphere of his range in nearly incomprehensible but beautifully lyric vocals.  The harmonics are unconvetional and tight, the riffs catchy, and the transititions amazing.  The reason that I love this album over nearly any other album that has come out in the past few years is that it is a coherent work.  The Origin of Symmetry is not best enjoyed for single tracks, it is best enjoyed as a symphony of sorts (akin to the philosophy behind Green Day's American Idiot), from it's unassuming beginning with New Born to it's fantastically symphonic closing, this Muse offering is sure to become one of your most played albums, if you're willing to take the time to appreciate it.
1400076943|5.0|The title of the novel initially caught my attention. I had intended to buy the book as a gift to one of my colleagues at work and decided to read it first to make sure she will like it. Well, lets say I bought her another book instead because I couldn't help not keeping Purple Hibiscus for myself. Chimamanda gave a very powerful account of the experience of the young Nigerian girl, highlighting very important influencers to growing up in the Nigerian society: religion, culture, politics, poverty, hope, courage and survival.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Let me start by saying this album may have been a flop by Madonna's standards but it still did decidedly well, going to the top of many charts all over the world and spawning successfull UK singles. This album was also released at a time when it wasn't cool to bash President Bush. That fact may have accounted to the albums relative poor consensus worldwide.<br /><br />Let me start by comparing this album to Ray Of Light, one of Madonna's best albums and critically successfull as well. Compared to Ray Of Light this album is hugely different, in many ways actually. Firstly on this album she is more absorbed in what she is singing about, the introspectiveness of Ray Of Light has been swapped for truth. This album may also be judged as a reflection or reconciliation. It is by far her most personal to album date.<br /><br />The songs on American Life have been panned by reviewers for horrible production and trashy beats. Personally the production is actually quite good and the beats are even better. This album is more risky than previous efforts. Her fellow producer on this album, Mirwais Ahmadzai may be a relative unknown however he creates wonders on this album.<br /><br />The album starts off with the hugely controversial title track, American Life. In the music video there are images of war and many see it as a reference to President Bush. Back to the song, it is quite a truthful song stating many different subjects, a reflection almost. The beats are killer and the vocals are really well polished. The slow chorus is really nice too. The rap is quite good but Madonna should stick to singing.<br /><br />Hollywood, another single taken from this album was an utter flop in the US completely missing the Hot 100. The song is about Hollywood and the different faces of it. While a commercial flop the song is actually really good and should have made the Hot 100.<br /><br />The next song is I'm So Stupid. The harmonies are alright and the song has an overall nice feel to it. The bit at the start where it appears she is sort of shouting and then is joined in by another voice has quite a nice feel to it. The beats, again superb.<br /><br />Love Profusion was another single lifted from American Life. It is a really nice ballad and comes across sort of similar to Intervention, again a mix of acoustic and electronic beats.<br /><br />The fifth track, Nobody Knows Me was released as a club only track in the US and performed quite well. Nobody Knows Me is an edgy dance cut and has been labelled 'experimental'. The song fits the club scene perfectly and has a strong beat, again.<br /><br />Nothing Fails is one of the best songs on the album and did quite well overseas hitting the #1 spot in Spain. The song is co-written by Jem and Guy Sigsworth. The choir towards the end is great and nostalgic of Like A Prayer. The whole song is a perfect ballad.<br /><br />Intervention comes next, although it sounds alot like Love Profusion it is still a strong songand mixes the albums chief musical elements well, acoustic and electronic.<br /><br />The next song is a superb acoustic guitar song, X-Static Process. The title may be a bit wordy but the song is really nice and makes alot of references to Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Mother And Father is about her mothers death, like the song Mer Girl from Ray Of Light. It really is an emotional song with somehow ironical up-beat tempo beats.<br /><br />The most well known song from American Life would probably be, Die Another Day. Coming from the James Bond movie of the same name this song is a stand-out and one of the better performing songs chart-wise from this album. The video is a little bit controversial as it has scenes of brutality.<br /><br />The last track on the album is Easy Ride a beautiful string orientated track with beauiful vocals and haunting harmonies. Overall a great way to end such a spectacular album.<br /><br />Don't let the critics tell you that this is just plain vulgar pop trash, this is Madonna's most personal album to date.<br /><br />American Life will always stay underrated and ignored because the critics just don't realise real talent. The album is risky, sure what Madonna work isn't but it is actually good, not vulgar.ulgar pop trash, this is Madonna's most personal album to date. <br />American Life will always stay underrated and ignored because the critics just don't realise real talent. The album is risky, sure what Madonna work isn't but it is actually good, not vulgar. <br /> <br />
B000002LHX|3.0|Each and every song has a different feel to it.  It is such a shame that \\"Batdance\\" wasn't used for the opening credits or, even in the movie itself.  The song gives life to the surreality of the movie.
0895260131|5.0|In this well-written and easy to follow guide, Robert Spencer exposes the lies and omissions that have allowed islam to be falsely promoted as a \\"religion\\" of tolerance and peace. Although the evidence is all around us - the suicide bombings in Bali, London, Iraq, Israel and Egypt, the foiled islamist attacks in California, Paris and Germany, the jihad in Sudan, the murder of non-muslims in Thailand, Kasmir, Indonesia, Russia, Lebanon and  the Philipines, the calls for the deaths of Jews and Christians on untold number of Islamist websites -  our mainstream media and liberal elites keep pushing the line that islam is not a threat to the world's 5 Billion infidels.  A quick glance at this Guide will show you the truth. Islam means submission, it is not in this world to be equal to other religions or political ideals but to eliminate them. The author gives us the very quotes from the Koran that call for our submission to islam or for our deaths. He shows us the very real diffence between the teachings of Christ (love and fellowship) and mohammed (the sword and punishment for non-believers). He also disproves the fiction that Christians and Jews under islam were treated well and shows through historical evidence that the phrase \\"islamic tolerance\\" is an oxy-moron. With it's punchy question and answer sections, it's easy to absorb information and it's telling use of statements of intent from leading muslim scholars, this is a book that is hard to put down. If you're ready for the truth about the real islam then this is a MUST READ. If you care about the nature of the society you or your children might one day live in , you owe it to yourself to own this book.

B000AMJDHY|4.0|This is a very intriguing listen.  You don't know whether you should drop everything and dance or else just kind of sit there and listen.  Very cool synth, cool songs, just an overall pretty cool album.  Would've given it five stars but the lead singer sounds a little too much like Fall Out Boy, not that that's a bad thing...just kind of makes it harder for P!ATD to be taken seriously.  Spend your money though, you won't be disappointed in your investment.

6304119046|5.0|It's surprising and a bit discouraging to me to see even defenders of this film (as opposed to mere trolls) characterizing it as \\"slow\\" or \\"dull.\\"  The real problem, I suspect, is the experience and expectations of modern viewers.  One critic recently observed that most mainstream contemporary American films seem to be made for an audience suffering from a collective case of attention deficit disorder.  They are full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  People come wanting merely \\"stimulation,\\" \\"entertainment,\\" and \\"escapism.\\"  And they walk away without gaining any wisdom or intellectual nourishment.  They aren't challenged to reflect on their life or their world.  In short, viewing these kinds of films is not an artistic experience in any way.  That's not to say there aren't worthwhile films being made today, because there are--but I'm talking about typical mainstream cineplex fare.    There also don't seem to be many \\"auteurs\\" left--cinema around the world has become more and more a corporate enterprise rather than the expression of an individual director's view of the world.  But the work of world-class directors such as Welles (and Renoir, Mizoguchi, Ozu, Kurosawa, Ray, Bergman, etc.) has demonstrated that films can be on a par with, say, great novels and plays.  These directors have used film as a medium for exploring complex human issues in an artful manner.    Citizen Kane--for many people the preeminent example of such a film--actually moves quite rapidly for the most part.  The opening dissolves create a sense of enigma and suspense, and the newsreel that follows utilizes very rapid cutting and a huge stream of images, some comic, some poignant.  From there we move fairly briskly through a sequence of flashbacks from the perspectives of different characters, each providing another piece of the puzzle and fleshing out the bare-bones story of the newsreel.  There are many movements backward and forward in time, and many scenes employ technical devices that are still dazzling (zip pans, rapid cuts, unusual angles, deep focus photography that creates multiple planes of significance, etc.).  And all the while we are penetrating deeper and deeper into the life of a man who had a huge impact on the America of his time--a fictional man, of course, but modeled loosely on William Randolph Hearst and not too far from such political/media brokers of more recent times as Ted Turner or Rupert Murdoch.    If brilliant, innovative, influential filmmaking and a story about politics, media, corruption, a sex scandal, and the inner life of a shaker-and-mover are found \\"boring,\\" maybe the fault lies with an audience that asks so little of film.
B00065GX64|5.0|A real sweet product from criterion.  Nice layout with the box and the menu screen.  Great picture booklit and loaded with special features on two discs.  I highly recommend this film to those who haven't seen it and for those who have I suggest you include this dvd in your library.
B00005JO0J|5.0|If you loved the first Star Wars movie because of a half-hero, half-miscreant with a sarcastic sense of humor about everything including himself, who loved his bag-of-bolts ship and kept slamming into adventure even though he'd rather've avoided it - YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!  And then you'll find yourself ordering the DVD set of the TV series that spawned this group of lovable characters (\\"Firefly\\"), you won't be able to stop watching the episodes over and over, each time finding a few more little bits of hilarious, and before you know it - you'll be proud to call yourself a Browncoat like the rest of us.
B00005JKG7|4.0|Just to let everyone know. The Fog remake will be PG-13 !!! What a slap in the face. a John Carpenter movie that's a watered down PG-13. Luckily, Doom and Saw 2 will be an R-rating. And the movie industry is wondering why fewer people go to the movies. First, i hate going to theatres cuz of the inflation in movie ticket prices, talkative/cell phone users/baby on board whining kids, expensive concession food, theatre always being extremely cold, and stupid remakes. Hello Charlie's Angels and Dukes of Hazzard. And now, all genre movies catering to teeny boppers with a PG-13 rating.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|**Warning: Spoilers ahead** <br /> <br />     I bought this Matrix collection back in December of last year.  I've watched this collection and thoroughly enjoyed it.  So you must be asking yourself, why did I bother writing a review so late after I got this collection?  Well, very recently I was watching the entire Matrix Trilogy (as well as several episodes of the Animatrix) in one sitting with a large group of people.  After the movies were done with, we broke out into discussion about these movies, specifically as to whether the quality of the movies dropped dramatically after the first movie.  Most of the people at this viewing chastised Reloaded and Revolutions, while one lone voice tried to defend these movies.  Guess who the lone voice was (I'll give you three guesses).  As such, this review is meant primarily as a rebuttal to the various comments I heard about the Matrix Trilogy, as well as my thoughts on the Matrix movies themselves. <br /> <br />     First off, let me just say that the following review will primarily consist of a discussion on the Matrix movies themselves, and not the many documentaries that are packaged with this collection.  Second, I want to focus on a discussion of the Matrix Trilogy as a whole, and as such I'll say something about all three movies, but Reloaded and Revolutions in particular.  Lastly, I realize that different people have different opinions, and everybody is entitled to there own opinions.  I only want to present the reasons why I enjoyed all three movies so hopefully you will understand why I think the Matrix Trilogy is good. <br /> <br />     Notice how in the last sentence I said \\"good\\", not \\"great\\".  I am going to admit something right now...yes, I will agree with almost everybody who has seen all three movies that the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions were not as good as the first Matrix.  HOWEVER, where I disagree with many people is how far the \\"quality\\" dropped after the first Matrix.  Some people have even gone as far to say that Reloaded and Revolutions (especially Revolutions) are the worst movies of all time.  Please.  I've seen the worst movie of all time, and it's called Starship Troopers 2.   <br /> <br />     When I saw the first Matrix in the theatres so many years ago, I was completely blown away.  Not only did it have some of the best action sequences and choreographed fights ever put on film, but it had an intriguing discussion on the nature of reality, and what it means to be human.  On the other hand the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions did not have as much philosophizing, but instead focused more on action.  I think that is one of the reasons why people disliked Reloaded and Revolutions, i.e. many people felt that these two movies focused too much on \\"mindless action.\\"  I would argue though that if Reloaded and Revolutions talked more about \\"what is reality?\\" like in the first movie, people would get board pretty easily because that idea was already discussed at long length in the first Matrix.  In any case the directors needed to move along with the Trilogy's plot. <br /> <br />     Ah yes...plot.  What is \\"plot\\"?  Apparently, to the detractors of Reloaded and Revloutions, these two movies had no plot.  To them I ask...are you blind, or did you just not bother paying attention?  The last human city, Zion, is just hours away from total destruction and there doesn't seem to be a way to stop the Machines.  Neo has visions of Trinity's death and has to find a way to save her.  Is everything Neo doing predestined, or does he have control over his own destiny?  How can Neo stop Agent Smith when he's able to create so many copies of himself?  Those are just some of the plotlines in these movies that apparently don't exist.  As a counterpoint, let us consider the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (which, in my opinion, are some of the best movies of all time).  On the surface, the plot of these three movies appears razor thin, i.e. it's simply all about trying to destroy a powerful ring.  But if you look deeper you'll find stories of hope, betrayal, courage, greed, and love.  The same applies to the Matrix Trilogy.  On the surface, all it seems to be about is Neo trying to stop the Machines, but if you look past that you'll find so much more. <br /> <br />     With Reloaded and Revolutions, the Wachowski brothers upped the ante with what could be done with special effects.  The fact is I am not a person who thinks special effects can make a movie on their own, but you would have to really hate science-fiction movies to not be at least somewhat enthralled with the action in these movies.  Seeing Neo fight dozens of Agent Smiths all on his own in the Matrix Reloaded, and kicking their asses all over the place, was both weird and exciting at the same time.  When the forces of Zion had to defend the city against a massive Machine invasion force in the Matrix Revolutions, I was on the edge of my seat!  I don't understand how anyone could think that seeing people in giant, gun-toting robot suits, blasting away at hundreds of Machine sentinels was not cool.  Yes I know, storyline (which the Trilogy has in spades) is far more important than computer generated effects, but these effects are some of the most groundbreaking ever produced. <br /> <br />     To be honest, looking back I think that one of the primary reasons that people disliked Reloaded and Revolutions was because of their expectations.  After people were blown away by the first Matrix, everybody was expecting the Wachowski brothers to make movies that would cause our heads to explode in the theatres from their sheer greatness.  When that did not happen people became disappointed, even to the level of outrage in some cases.  Reloaded and Revolutions were different in terms of plot and tone than the first Matrix, which many viewers did not like.  Now, this is not to excuse the fact that Reloaded and Revolutions were not and good as the first Matrix, because they weren't.  But our expectations of a movie can definitely have an impact on how we perceive it. <br /> <br />     In the end, the Matrix Trilogy is not going to receive the same reverence as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and the original Star Wars Trilogy.  However, I think it should deserve remembrance for the opening our eyes as to the potential of science-fiction.  The first Matrix movie is arguably one of the best sci-fi movies of all time, and the Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions are good movies in their own right.  Even when I get older, I will still fondly remember all three Matrix movies.  If you have never seen the Matrix Trilogy, I urge you to at least see the first one.  If you have time, go see Reloaded and Revolutions with an open mind, and I think you will come away pretty satisfied. <br /> <br />My rating on the Matrix Trilogy as a whole: 8/10. <br />
B000001ESF|5.0|I could go into a long in-depth analysis of the album, but will spare you. There are enough here in this forum, and I really couldn't add anything that hasn't already been said. <br /> <br />All I know is, I heard this album when I called a friend of mine on the telephone. He was jamming to it in his garage, and it was playing in the background. It blew me away, literally rocked my world. Enough said...
B00007LTIB|5.0|This is drummer Alan White's first impressive performance with the band.  I think it has to do with the fact that the mix is much better than it was on _Topographic Oceans_.  Listen to his solo at the beginning of \\"Sound Chaser\\" and gape.  Patrick Moraz brings a jazz influence to the overall sound.  However, I contend that Yes is a classically influenced band.  You can hear a Stravinsky-like rhythm (I'm thinking of _The Rite of Spring_) toward the beginning and at the end of \\"The Gates of Delirium,\\" plus the final chord of the same song echoes Stravinsky's _Firebird_.  Yes likes to call their music \\"songs,\\" but they're closer to classical pieces - especially the 20-minute variety.  There's a soundscape of distorted guitar before the \\"Soon, oh soon\\" part that makes my jaw drop.  Chris Squire has got to be the best prog rock bassist in the business, with only John Wetton for rival.  In the middle of \\"Delirium\\" he switches from Rickenbacker to his old Fender fretless P-Bass, and there's a part where the synth gets diabolical while Squire plays a few diminished fifths and other hot licks.  It's a fast 3/4 just before the drums and bass pound out a series of eighth notes and slow down before the 11/8 section (I apologize to non-musicians if they don't recognize time signatures).  I haven't said anything about Anderson's voice; I guess I don't pay much attention to it.  It sounds either like a woman's or a little boy's.  But as a lyricist Anderson is a master, synthesizing spirituality with Romantic, Victorian, and modern poetry.  I regret that we Americans don't get that kind of poetry pounded into us when we're in grade school as the Brits do in \\"public school.\\"  _Relayer_ is a masterpiece of composed, classically influenced progressive rock (also called \\"art rock\\").  Listen to it in good health.
B00005JNQS|5.0|The 2005 animated film \\"Robots\\", created by Blue Sky Studios and Fox Animation Studios, tells the fictional tale of a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGregor) who lives in a world populated purely by robots.  After he was built and upgraded (often with spare parts) by his parents, he decides to venture from his small town to Robot City where the famed robot Bigweld (voice of Mel Brooks) resides.  Rodney, inspired by Bigweld who spends his life inventing and improving parts for robots, has become an inventor himself partly to help his father Herb Copperbottom (voice of Stanley Tucci), who has been a dishwasher for many years and is increasingly in need of repair.  However, spare robot parts are becoming increasingly scarce because a greedy robot named Ratchet (voice of Greg Kinnear) and his mother Madame Gasket (voice of Jim Broadbent) took over Bigweld's robotic supply company.  Their plan is to replace outdated robots with new sleek models and reap the profits.  To do so, they need to melt down as many spare parts as possible to create their sleek new designs.  So, many robots run fearfully away as the large collector robots scour Robot City for spare parts that they then take to the furnaces operated by Madame Gasket.  In desperation, many outdated robots that are breaking down come to Rodney in hopes of being repaired.  Rodney then becomes determined to help them with assistance from an odd assortment of other robots. <br /> <br />With wonderfully rendered computer animation and a wonderful story, \\"Robots\\" is a fun and engaging story for both young and old alike.  Other interesting characters include Piper (voice of Amanda Bynes), Crank (voice of Drew Carey), Aunt Fanny (voice of Jennifer Coolidge), Fender (voice of Robin Williams) and Lug (voice of Harland Williams).  The story for the film (written by Ron Mita, Jim McClain and David Lindsay-Abaire) is possibly an allegory to modern society as demonstrated by it's conveyance of greed and the constant need to upgrade trying to replace a philosophy based upon repair, reuse, recycling and thrift.  Overall, I rate \\"Robots\\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.
B000002C25|2.0|I can see what Noel is tring to do on this album, hes tring to keep the rock/pop theme but slow it down a bit. It didnt work, <br />He ended up with a lot of boring, annoying noise. <br />The best tracks on the album are: <br /> <br />1. Stand by me <br />2. Fade in-out <br />3. It's gettin' better man <br /> <br />The ones to avoid are: <br /> <br />1. My Big Mouth (pathetic) <br />2. The girl in the dirty shirt <br />3. Magic Pie  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a huge disappointment and i would not recommend it.
B0009F9O6W|3.0|All right, I can understand the time period that this was recorded, and I can understand the need for Peter Hammill and company to be considered \\"farther out\\" than their prog contemporaries, but the lyrics here are ridiculous:<br /><br />\\"But stalking in my cloisters hang the acolytes of gloom<br /><br />and Death's Head throws his cloak onto the corner of my room.\\"<br /><br />Come on!  Hammill's voice doesn't make me take these lyrics any more seriously.  I can appreciate the Vietnam-era thought behind Lemmings, and it certainly has relevance to today's world situation, but overall this album is a major disappointment.  The drumming is superior, and the sax curls in and out of the songs nicely, but there is ZERO guitar here.  Strike one.  Strike two, the lyrics, and Hammill's annoying vocal delivery makes strike three.<br /><br />\\"We have looked upon the High Kings,<br /><br />found them less than mortals:<br /><br />their names are dust before the just<br /><br />march of our young, new law.<br /><br />Minds stumbling strong, we hurtle on<br /><br />into the dark portal;<br /><br />No-one can halt our final vault<br /><br />into the unknown maw.\\"<br /><br />Still shaking my head as I go back to my Genesis.....
B00097A5I6|3.0|Okay, this is Oasis' 3rd best album. Although it is not as good as the legendary Defintely Maybe and (WTS) Morning Glory, it is better than the rubbish they have produced in between. <br />The songs have definitely slowed down and become more acoustic, but they have done so in a very cool, Beatlesesque way and they have not, of course, lost any of that sneering mancunian swagger. <br />The best track on the album is easily \\"The importance of being Idle\\". It combines a good rhythmic melody with Noel's fantastic singing talents (yes, I think he sings better than that arrogant, idiotic one, Liam is it?). The songs that new band members Andy and Gem arent in the same league as Noel and Liams songs but they're getting there. Liam's main track on the album, \\"The Meaning of soul\\" is quite catchy but the lyrics show immediately that its Liam writing it, who else could put \\"I'm different breed, im outta your league, im 10 outta 10\\" HAHA, its arrogant rubbish. <br />Overall I quite enjoy this compilation of catchy little riffs and slow meaningful tunes but i can see why people would dislike it. It could one of the greatest albums of all time but it is so easy to compare it to their earlier and better stuff.
B000000OSE|5.0|Use your illusions 1 and 2 are some of the best hard rock albums ever recorded.Since there are allot of songs on these albums, most of the songs are considered filler,but rest asured,the only filler on either album is my world.<br /><br />Right next door to hell:10/10:great song,killer opener<br />Dust N Bones:Really good vocals, an instant classic<br />Live and let die:8/10 Not the greatest cover, but I really like to listen to this track for some reason<br />Don't Cry:9/10 Kinda boring, but the guitar solo is kick ass<br />Perfect Crime:8/10 Hyper song, kinda insane in some parts and rather short,plus the placement here is wierd: we get a slow, sad love song,then an insane Hard rock song with a chorus that goes:\\"god dammit, it's a perfect crime,Motherf&*ker, its a perfect crime,I SAID ITS PERFECT!\\" F&*ked up.<br />You aint the first:7/10 This song has Izzy Axl and Shannon on vocals, it's very country like.Good, though.<br />Bad Obsession:8/10 Pretty good stuff<br />Back off bitch:9/10 funny breakup song,kinda insane in some parts<br />double talkin jive:10/10 really cool song<br />November Rain:7/10 A total snooze fest til slash's solo kicks in<br />The garden:9/10 very good song,Alice cooper sings on it, Shannon too.<br />Garden Of edan:9/10 christ, this is fast.It's punk.<br />don't damn me:9/10 Good lyrics<br />bad apples:10/10 This song rocks, it grows on you.And it aint filler<br />Dead horse:8/10 Pretty good<br />Coma:10/10 An epic, It's ten minutes in length and is one of the gunners' best songs. The lyrics are very dark and well written.its about a guy who would rather live in a Coma than live in the real world.<br /><br />Buy this
B000002TQB|4.0|This could be one of the greatest albums ever released. But the stupid cockney accent that Damon puts on in most of the songs its ridiculous. <br />\\"Girls and Boys\\" is one of the most catchy pop songs of all time and \\"End of a century\\" is a very meaningful and likeable song but \\"Parklife\\" is awful, especially as its the main track on the album. Its just a nusery rhyme of a load of rubbish. <br /> <br />Best songs: <br /> <br />1. End of a Century <br />2. Girls and Boys <br />3. This is a low <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002N2P|5.0|First, I wanna say,Greendaysucks,you are a total loser.you go review every green day album saying that green day sucks,when you probably don't even own any of their records.I hate simple plan,but I don't review all of their records saying that their gay(even though they are).Okay,back to business.This is a fantastic album,green days most punkish record.It was, in my oppinion, better than dookie, and it is certainly better than american idiot.Though not as in your face as the sex pistols,or rancid, this still pretty good
B000068QY7|3.0|An improvement on the last 3 albums, defintely, but still nowhere near as impressive as the first two. <br /> <br />This album is a complete mixture of songs, the good the bad and the very Liam Gallagheresque ugly. the best on the album are: <br /> <br />1. Little by Little (a fantastic, catchy, soulful tune) <br />2. The Hindu Times (strangely named but the only hint of the real Oasis) <br />3. Songbird (good to see Liam has a tiny bit of talent, just) <br /> <br />The tracks to forget: <br /> <br />1. She is Love (a quiet acoustic one, but instead of being meaningful and pleasent like, Half the world away and Married with Children, its just plain boring) <br />2. Stop cring your heart out (stop making a fuss over nothing more like! realy not as good as everyone makes out) <br /> <br />Overall, I think this is Oasis' 4th best album. Definitely Maybe and (WTS) Morning Glory are in a different league and Dont belive the Truth is slightly ahead. <br />
B000089CJI|5.0|I think I qualify for reviewing \\"Give Up\\" by the Postal Service. I have listened to it nonstop since I bought it half a year ago. It has been my most enjoyable album, since it hasn't gotten old. <br /> <br />Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello made a great match. I'm glad they collaborated once before under the name Dntel, or this album would have never been. <br /> <br />The sounds of quirky electronic noises and Fender guitars accord throughout an album of fantasy. From basslines out of broken speakers, to poppy high-tempoed sing alongs. The moods they create are very soothing, and the mix of Indie Pop and Electronica is great. I can't really say that anything sounds like this, even after finding some electronica bands through the internet. If you like Dntel, then you will like the Postal Service. If you like Death Cab for Cutie, you probably will like the Postal Service.  <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\". It's first saw-ish synthesiser riff is the perfect opening to an album. It immediatly grabs you, and after two measures, the sounds of snappy surreal drums and Ben's singing come in. <br /> <br />A cachy lyrical song comes up next, \\"Such Great Heights\\". Personally, not my favorite, but mostly everyone knows them by this song and it isn't too bad anyways. Has a lot of electronica and a guitar interlude. <br /> <br />\\"Sleeping In\\" comes up next. It starts with a nice lullaby-sound riff. Drums come in and the song starts. What I get from it is, the lyrics are about the thought of everything simplistic. This was one of the first songs I ever heard from the Postal Service, and is still one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Track 4, \\"Nothing Better\\" is a duet featuring Jenny Lewis from Rilo Kiley. Pretty simple electronica, but great... It is very cachy and is found to play with chords. <br /> <br />\\"Recycled Air\\" comes on next. This is probably their most 'chill' song on the record. It is a great song. A phaser lasts a majority of the song with sounds of violins and other random instruments giving their two cents throughout. <br /> <br />Next is \\"Clark Cable\\", a Disco sounding story. Again, pretty simple, but at the end it is awesome. Not the best of the album, but still better than your everyday alternative on the radio. <br /> <br />\\"We Will Become Sillhouttes\\" comes up next. The most upbeat jiving song on the albun. It's a great song, something even the old ones out there can enjoy. A mix of great real and electeronic instruments. Just musicaly great... you'll have to hear it for yourself. <br /> <br />It comes to \\"This Place is a Person\\"... kind of a dark song on the albun. This is one of the few songs that is based off a true story on this album. Overpunched bass with those innocent keyboard sounds as we heard in 'Sleeping In'. The songs buils without you knowing it, until you hear the climax. <br /> <br />I consider this the last song, \\"Brand New Colony\\". It is another awesome electronica-indie fusion that you just wanted to move along to. I like the lyrics the most in this song, the verses are mostly metaphores and it's just real good. The interlude all the way to the end is a great ending to the album, and I think this should have been the last song. <br /> <br />It ends with \\"Natural Anthem\\", the actual last song. Actually isn't really Natrual at all, a lot of electronic loops over and over and if you haven't already heard it a dozen times, then you probably won't like it. About four minutes of building of electronic noises, which is real basic Electronica and then finallly Ben comes in with some vocals for the end. This song really isn't anything like Postal Service, not really Dntel either, I dunno, it's just different. <br /> <br />I like every song on that track. \\"Natural Anthem\\" takes some time to get use to and \\"Clark Gable\\" is a little too Disco sounding, but besides that, all Clasics. I give this album 5/5 <br /> <br />If you got 15 bucks in your pocket and don't know how to spend it, I say you go buy GIVE UP.
B00092ZL80|5.0|Odd that it is, I've been a Chicago fan since their first album; really have grown up my whole life with Chicago, yet Earth Wind and Fire never really entered my consciousness.  Then I saw this show.  This show was on INHD tv, a marvelous high def show, and they repeated several times, and I was hooked..not just on Chicago but EWF also.  The band's repeated the dual concert mode this summer, and I had to go.  And it was just awesome.  The show I saw this summer in Atlantic City NJ was virtually the same show as this DVD (except Walter wasn't there for some reason I don't know).  Both bands give it their all....and while you can say that Phillip Bailey or Bobby Lamm cannot sing like they once did (to be honest I don't know if Bobby Lamm was ever a great singer) but the talent that is grouped together is just fantastic.  If you like EITHER band more than a little you will love this show.  My family has watched the DVD now several times, and we never get tired of it.
B000A6T1KE|1.0|I have been watching ST since the late 60s.  Every TV show, every movie, read most of the books, etc.  I know these characters.  This movie was just plain BAD.  The writing was disjointed, the lighting was horrible, and there was none of the inside humor that made all of the best ST shows and films as good as they were.  This film has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever.  It's especially unfortunate that it appears to be the last ST film for the forseeable future.  One final note:  I don't get the comparisons to ST II and ST III that some of the other reviewers have made.  Those were actually pretty good films, II being one of the best.  This was just a sad mess, and all those currently in charge of overseeing the ST franchise should be ashamed of themselves.
0385507755|5.0|This book was filled with addiction, hope, life, every day struggles, depression, courage, strength, and most importantly a profound, deep respect for James Frey. This book is a MUST READ.I will say it again, A MUST READ.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Maintaining that level of tension for so long wore me out. It's not all in your face action/violence tension. Often the tension comes from conflicts between characters. Or with one character struggling with their own choices. Of course, the creepy villian and downright disturbing Reavers add to the tension nicely. (You understand quickly why the characters quake in their boots at the very mention of Reavers.) <br /> <br />Aside from the tension, Serenity has good pacing, solid action, great balance of humorous and deadly serious dialogue, great characters, and even a few moments you know are just to give you a thrill and you love it because you crave those old-fashion thrills. <br /> <br />I have only one quibble, which I have a hard time quibbling about. So much is packed into Serenity... It's rather frantic and hard to dig deeply into all that is revealed. But I know why the film-maker put it all in Serenity, and I'm grateful I got to see all of these things, even if it was something of a tight fit.  <br /> <br />And I just want to know: is it too early for DVD preorders?
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I absolutely loved these DVD's.  The show is so witty & intelligent & the characters are hilarious.  I now have the first four seasons of the show & have withdrawal symptons when waiting for each series to arrive in the post!  My 7 year old niece loves the show as well as my husband so great for all the family!
B00005YUNY|3.0|I know a) from having been there and b) from my much played and now worn out VHS version, that this is a stunningly good concert. Unfortunately, Amazon sent me a Region 1 DVD when I live in Region 2. To be fair, they have refunded my money, but I would much prefer a working DVD. Anyone with a multi region player into a swap for this DVD? <br />Love to all Yes fans. <br />Alan

B000002TLX|5.0|I have always liked Richard Marx since I was in Junior High & High School and we danced to his songs at dances. But Keep coming Back is the song that holds a special place in my heart. Every party I went to my sophmore year someone would pop in a tape of mixes and this song was on it at most of them. Well after almost a year of flirting he finally asked me to dance and it was to this song and then he kissed me. Although we were only together for 4 months & I don't know where he is now, I always think of him when I hear this.
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little pieces is the best book I have read in a while. It truly puts you in the situation with Frey as if you were right beside of him the whole time. It is a wonderful flowing read and keeps you think bout all he has been through and if you were him could you have made it half as far.This book is a should read for midteens, parents of children of any age to older adults. It truly puts you in dead center of the adiction world. Cannot wait to read the new one if it is as fantastic as this one.
B0002S947K|5.0|This could be the most fulfilling cd I've purchased in the last 23 years of my existence.  His voice is captivating, soothing, and a bit painful(in the sense that he feels something from the lyrics).  I first got the album about 8 months ago and I'm telling you it is still something that I listen to regularly. Ever since I heard him perform on the Craig Kilborn show I've been listening to him and now I'm just waiting to see what will come from him in the future.  He brings a breath of fresh air and hope to a music industry full of glitter and glamour, he brings it back to the raw essence of what music should be about, the feelings and emotion that relay from the words of the song to everyday life that we all should be able to relate to.  If you are in need of a music high or you just want to hear good music, I highly recommend this cd to anyone with ears to hear and a heart to fill.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|Perhaps, like me, you are concerned of the hype surrounding Neil Young's newest release. Oh, no-not another heralded cd from a back-side of fifty voice from the past! I fell for the hype surrounding the newest albums by Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, Van Morrison, and the Rolling Stones. Those albums have not been bad, but they have (IMHO) fallen far short of the hype lavished on them. <br /> <br />Neil Young's newest release is worthy of the hype it has received. While not quite the career-resurrecting achievement of Dylan's TIME OUT OF MIND or LOVE AND THEFT, Prairie Wind finds Neil in fine form making memorable music once again. <br /> <br />

B000AP04L0|5.0|\\"You see Bob, it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care.\\"  This line from this Mike Judge film sums up what Office Space is all about.  If you sit in a cubicle 8 hours a day and mentally scream then Office Space is your bio-pic.  This movie just oozes hilarity.  From the corporate butt boy, Bill Lumbergh, played by Gary Cole to the ignored and abused Milton Waddams played by Stephen Root this is your work day.  Ron Livingston gives an all-star performance as the hypnotized, hates his job, number cruncher Peter Gibbons.  And, Jennifer Aniston, as the \\"just the right amount of flair\\" waitress Joanna does a good job playing it straight to Livingston's burnt out Gibbons.  There are also fine performances by David Herman and Ajay Naidu as Livingston's co-workers.  Director Mike Judge has a talent for making good comedy out of our normal mundane day to day conversations.  This is a movie you can watch over and over.  This DVD is a definite buy.  It's time to tear down the cubicles, at least mentally.
B0000025DD|4.0|Not being used to writing reviews you'll have to be a little patient. I found this album o.k. as I am a huge Floyd fan. I have all their albums, and am now collecting odd bits here and there of the solo stuff. One I can not seem to get is Rick Wrights \\"Wet Dreams\\". However I digress. The Album is fine, I would call it possibly a background music album. No specific favourites for me on there, however I am glad I purchased it, if for no other reason I would kick myself in years to come if it was the only one I did not have. For collectors of all things Floyd, give it a look. If you are a prog rock purist alone, probobaly take it or leave it . If you are looking for, or expecting somthing outstanding, that will leave you realing, extatic and on the point of doing it in your pants; forget it.
6301969294|2.0|Last evening I saw, for the first time, the film version of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead.  I haven't laughed so much in a long, long time, but of course I'm just part of the mob.  Anyway, here is a list of what you get for your nickel in this film:  1) Ayn Rand's heavy handed screen play.    2) Wooden Acting by Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey.    3) A great imitation of Vladimir Lenin in the Ellsworth Toohey character played by actor Robert Douglas.    4)  Patrica Neal as Ice Princess.  Anytime she comes on the screen you will be singing the old Foreigner tune \\"She's cold as ice.  She's willing to sacrifice our love.\\"    5) A film in black and white, and I mean black and white.  Everything in this story is black and white.    6) Gary Cooper's maniacal little grin right before ravishing the Dominique Francon character played by Patricia Neal.  He even has the grin when he is thinking about ravishing, and possibly raping by the look on the character Howard Roork's face, Dominique.    7) Dominque's husband, Gail Wynand played by Raymond Massey,  pronouncing her name Dominic.  (A little homoeroticism going on here?)    8) Straight lines and lots of them.    9) At the end of the movie a giant phallic symbol looking of a skyscraper and Patricia Neal almost in orgasm as she rides up the construction elevator to meet her new sex partner, Gary Cooper.    10)  Finally, you will find out that all that matters in life is Architecture.  (Maybe, Art Vandalay was right?)    The only reason this movie rates 2 stars is that the direction of this film by King Vidor is actually quite good.  And considering he had to work under that harpy, Ayn Rand, he should have gotten a medal for martyrdom.  The screen play and acting rate ZERO stars.  Well maybe a 1/2 star for comic relief.    Until I saw this movie I thought Ayn Rand and Objec!ivists in general had no sense of humor.  And to think some folks believe anything written by Rand is perfection itself.

B00005UKE0|5.0|At only 18 I've seen very little of life and known very little of the classic rock seen first hand. but still, things are often a mystery to me musically. a classic gem of a cd or an epic masterpiece will set on the shelf for a while until i find it to change me. George had always been my favorite beatle and it wasn't until the wonderful 'concert for george' that i really heard george's music. after i watched that concert i bought 'All things must pass' and honestly, the music changed my life. The first cd contains such classics as \\"my sweet lord\\", \\"isn't it a pity\\" , \\"wah wah\\" \\"what is life\\" and countless others. the lesser known songs like, \\"If not for you\\" 'behind that lock door\\" will captivate you and move you like few other musicians can. George belived in his music and it shows in the first solo album. everything he had stored up from the beatle's appears here in fine form with help from legend's like Clapton and Billy Preston. The second cd contains the title track and songs that will grow on your spiritually. \\"art of dying\\" \\"awaiting on you all\\" \\"i dig love\\" \\"apple scruffs\\" \\"beware of darkness\\" and \\"hear me lord\\" will touch your soul in ways you never thought possible. i give this cd the highest rating possible. i have never written a review for any cd's before and i own a lot of cd's but this masterpiece will take you to places youve never seen. enjoy.
B00001MXXH|4.0|Slightly unbelievable, but folks ate this up in 1986 and still do today when new audiences discover it.  Not like movies aren't on a wish-fullfilmant level sometimes, which is the case here.  No ones principal would chase after them, and no teen could be a high-school version of James Bond, deceiving whomever he wants.  But when you look at the more realistic moments, especially 80s maestro Hughes' patented teen insights, you have some character exploration.  The scene in the garage after the car is totaled may be the film's best moment.  As Broderick is actually powerless for once over somebody and Cameron decides to do what's best for him respect-wise. <br /> <br />So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart already:).

068987474X|1.0|As a guy, I feel that Greg Behrendth extremely oversimplifies mens' relationship to women in this book. While his ideas may be applicable a portion of the time (and a large portion for that matter), the book gives the message that any man giving mixed signals is not interestd in a relationship. When I saw Mr. Behrendth on the Oprah Winfrey show last year, I was very dissapointed that this message was being sent out to thousands of women who may now have lost men who really loved them but, for whatever reason, were not yet able to commit or were giving mixed signals for a variety of other reasons.  I don't think he should lead readers to assume that the lack of strong, direct signals indicate a relationship is worthless.
B00009V7ON|4.0|This is the ultimate example for the penniless screenwriter/filmmaker to work from.  That's the amazing thing, this could've been made by Joe Independent if he was so inclined.  Stick a guy on an island for four years, the only other cast member is a volleyball, and chart his progress.  You'd have to dump the big-budget plane crash, but that stuff can be remedied.  What you'd figure would be boring is actually quite captivating.  Forging for food, bad tooth, exploring the island, making fire.

As the film unfolds, both of their bleak outlooks on life - his worn on his sleeve, hers hidden beneath the steel resolve of a life that is acetic, on the surface - meet to dance a little with each other, and Pollack, wisely, does not pursue romance, just leaves the watcher believing that the two of them will remember each other for the rest of their lives.<br /><br /> Penn's character, Tobin Keller, is with the Secret Service.  He has recently lost a wife, in more ways than one.  Sylvia Broome (Kidman) has lost a brother.  You see him die in the opening scenes, but don't know he's her brother until much later in the film.  Both are reserved and steely in their resolve.  Their mistrust and wonderment about each other is cloaked in elegance.<br /><br />The setting is the United Nations, and Pollack filmed much of the movie there, a first.  His cinematography (by Darius Khondji) makes you intimate with the UN, it is crisp and alive.  Sylvia is an interpreter there, one of few who can speak Ku, the primary language of the African country, Matobo.  (Matobo is fictional).  Some of the political heat that Pollack has taken about the film is in the \\"fictionalization\\" of Matobo.  In character and events, there is much that is reminiscent of real life African countries; Pollack has merely given us a hodge podge of likely events.<br /><br />Broome's knowledge of the language allows her to overhear a threat against Matobo's dictator, who is to visit the UN.  The threat is brought through channels, and the wheels of security begin to invade Sylvia's and the UN's existence.  Assassination of Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) would be devastating for the world opinion of the UN, and cause even more instability in his little corner of the world.<br /><br />In tense sequences, the drama plays out with the UN backdrop; the most exciting scenes taking place with a potential bomb on a bus - here Pollack shifts incessantly between the bus and the security forces who track and follow it from various venues in the city.  There's also a remarkable scene for Penn when he finds, without really seeing, an assassin in Sylvia's apartment.<br /><br />It becomes obvious that Sylvia is no innocent bystander, that she has an agenda, that unlikely as she seems, she is an activist; is she, in part responsible for the threat?  Tobin Keller does not really know, he just begins to trust his instincts about her.  As the film moves rapidly (it is a long film, but the time seems to go swiftly) to the end, the filmgoer realizes that he/she's been caught up in the performances strung together with some well-filmed action sequences, but that the message that Pollack was trying to convey got a little lost, and dragged its feet.  As such, the time spent viewing it is well spent, but, as you reflect on the film, you're not certain it will have a lasting affect on you.<br /><br />Some points that need to be brought up - Catherine Keener is a welcome presence as Tobin's partner.  She's dynamite in what is little more than a cameo.  And the DVD has some excellent extras, notably:  A Day in the Life of Real Interpreters, and a feature on the use of the UN for filming, The Ultimate Movie Set:  The United Nations (I was less enthusiastic about the features I normally like, an alternate ending, the deleted scenes...good thing they were deleted... and scenes of Sydney Pollack at work at the set).<br /><br />This is a film that should be watched for its context, particularly in light of where we are and where we are not in the world today; a film that should be appreciated for its nuance - but the action sequences will be more attractive and it is the disconnect between the film's intellectual value and the action that is bothersome.  This coupling was done far better in \\"Hotel Rwanda\\", for one.<br /><br />See it, but rent it.on a bus - here Pollack shifts incessantly between the bus and the security forces who track and follow it from various venues in the city.

B0000A98ZP|4.0|I can't say enough about John Hughes.  What can you say about a guy who writes and produces twelve classic films in only seven years time.  This was his sort of \\"My Dinner With Andre\\", as he just put five actors together and let them talk.  Not just teens, but adults as well will hark back to this time in their life, where you could do no right.  Your parents, your friends, your teachers, even the janitor, can't help but bag on you and point out shortcomings.  Hughes use of kids from different backgrounds and social standing is the key, and he explores it masterfully.  So for the young writer, don't worry if your film is dialogue heavy, just make it insightful and you'll be okay.    So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart already:). (...)
0553210246|5.0|The Mayor of Casterbridge is a superbly crafted tale of youthful folly and the futility of repentance.  Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.<br /><br />The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret.  He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community.  But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.<br /><br />The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.<br /><br />Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.<br /><br />Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read!  The many TV movies and mini-series do not do it justice!
B00005JXY3|4.0|Most are divided on this sequel, but if you look at it deep down, some elements are better than the first film.  First and foremost, Daniel is not protected by the confines of a tournament anymore.  Or a nice enough bully who kicks you and walks away.  This film's tagline in 1986 was \\"This time, the combat is real\\".  And that is the core.  In the end, Daniel's new foe wants him dead, and this time neither Miyagi or \\"points\\" can save him.      Even the storm sequence, which in another film would be hokey time-filler, is actually a device to bring Sato and Miyagi together again as friends.  As well as drive the final rift between Chozen and Daniel.  And the tea ceremony just an excuse to kiss?  Not if you recall Kumiko saying during Miyagi and Yukie's ceremony, \\"They are falling love again\\".  Kumiko was not only telling Daniel she wanted to be intimate, but that she was falling in love with him.  So many great set-ups and pay-offs for the viewer.    So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart :). (...)

0618001905|5.0|I have just finished Hochschild's \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" and I am amazed.  Terrific book from start to finish - it is kind of jumpy, but every chapter has something extraordinary to offer and you will find yourself what did you learn in history classes after all?  This is definitely a biased history (anti-King Leopold and Belgian colonization of the Congo) but one wonders what King Leopold would offer in his defense if he were allowed to make one.  Basically Leopold used the Congo as his personal cash cow, enriching himself and later Belgium while murdering or otherwise causing the deaths of millions of Congolese.  This book details how it happened, how this atrocity was exposed and what happened as an aftermath.  I was very moved by this book.<br /><br />Other books that might be read in connection with this book are \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" by Kingsolver, a historical fiction set in the Congo in the 1960s and \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Conrad, historical fiction set in the Congo during the 1890s (right during Leopold's raping and pillaging of the country).  Read and be amazed at the depths human kind will sink to to amass profits and plunder.
B000003TA4|5.0|Anyone who gives this below at least 4 stars is musically retarted.  <br /> <br />Yes, they did rip off some songs from the Pixies but that was it but every other band has done that. They were also influenced by the Beatles, Black Sabbath, and other hard rock bands. <br /> <br />All Nirvana tried to do was make an album to the people who liked their Bleach album and never expected to be famous overnight. Yea, I was one of those people and it surpassed it beyond beyond.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|First of all, to the person who gave Batman Begins a 1/5 and is saying that \\"Stan Lee\\" did not edit Tim Burton's work for the new Special Edition DVDs: you're an IDIOT. Stan Lee did NOT create Batman and he does not own the rights to Batman. Stan Lee created Spider-Man and he is part of Marvel Comics. Batman is a DC Comics character, created by Bob Kane and owned by his family since he died quite some time ago. So, now that I've destroyed this reviewer's credibility, I'll destroy his review.     Batman Begins is one of the best movies of 2005. The acting is wonderful. Bale is perfect as not only Batman, but more importantly as Bruce Wayne (something that cannot be said of Michael Keaton who was not young enough and certainly did not have the look described in the comics). The supporting cast is great, except for Katy Holmes. She's okay, but everyone else does such a great job that they make her look very mediocre. Michael Caine brings heart and a \\"fatherly\\" presence to Alfred that has not been seen in the previous Batman films. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Lucius Fox, a James Bond \\"Q\\" type character who creates all of Bruce/Batman's weapons. Liam Neeson does a great job as Bruce's mentor Ducard. Gary Oldman is wonderful as a young Commissioner Gordon (although he's just a sergeant and lieutenant in Batman Begins). Cillian Murphy does a great job as the sinister Dr. Crane/Scarecrow. As I said before, the acting is just wonderful.    The script is well-written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan. Nolan's direction is awesome as well. The film is as real as possible and uses the least amount of CGI possible for an action film in the 21st Century. Nolan makes this film a character development story, a heart-pounding action film, and at times a pretty scary horror movie (Batman actually is a predator and the audience gets to see how street thugs feel when he's hunting them). Batman has been re-invented. Thank goodness someone finally actually considered the COMICSfor a reference when making a Batman film. Batman Begins is without a doubt the best Batman film ever made and it is certainly one of the best films of the year. The acting, script, and direction are all superb.     The only drawback of this film is that the plot starts out great but sort of becomes chaotic while still being cliche. The beginning gives the audience an in-depth idea of how Bruce Wayne decides to conquer his fear and guilt. This part of the plot is wonderfully done by Christopher Nolan. Even when the plot becomes rather cliche (superhero saves a city against a mass destruction plot), the action sequences and one-liners make up for the lack of creativity with the general plot.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I don't know why, but suddenly seeing Led Zeppelin at Royal Albert Hall, such a pure force of nature and swagger--and dripping with energy and style--I wondered why anyone would have ever wanted it to come crashing down. If you love Led Zeppelin--or if you hate them--take a look at the little punk/rock comparison chart near the beginning of Russell David Harper's BALD. (Not a book for everyone--bizarre and funny though. Read it for what it has to say about Led Zeppelin and drinking and smoking etc.)
B0000028UK|4.0|This is still the good Pearl Jam, the band you can relate to, the album that has songs that stick in your head without having to be another 'Alive' or 'Jeremy' that made 'Ten' a success..lyrically a bit more politic, but at the same time a bit more uplifting and even humouristic concepts compared to 'Ten' which was serious all the way. More melodies also, and songs that are a bit more happy and joyful, and also more acoustic songs, which is great. 'Daughter' is an acoustic-driven song, and it was a big hit, a very good song simply...'Dissident' a very melodic riff and some overall nice singing...'Leash' is a great anthem youth song which is refreshing from PJ, and so is the bittersweet 'Glorified G' which talks about gun control with tongue-in-cheek lyrics, this is a song that wouldn't have fitted on 'Ten'...the rest is also good, like 'Animal' a pretty aggressive song that's one of the highlights on here...GREAT!
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|Our friends in Europe,Australia and Latin America will have the luxury of owning the collector's edition with DTS sound and guess what ... we will get stuck with the Dolby 5.1 version here in the US! The Paramount studio things the American don't have good ears. For such an historical re-release, please treat us right! <br /> <br />I have listened to both sound formats along with lot of other people and I believe that almost everybody will say that DTS sound is the way to go. Dolby 5.1 is good but DTS is outstanding. I wish they re-release Titanic in \\"Superbit\\" version which is the ultimate crystal clear video with DTS sound.Those who own \\"Superbit\\" DVDs know this unparallel quality (like Air Force One, Desperado or The Mask of Zorro). <br /> <br />Titanic (movie/features):5 stars, Titanic (sound):3 stars, therefore average 4 stars.
B00004YA0T|4.0|These CDs contain performances of the nine Bruckner symphonies. <br />Of these 3,4,7,8,9 are remarkable, with 4, 8 and 9 being <br />masterpieces. The performances by Eugen Jocum and the Dresden <br />Staatskapelle orchsetra are well-designed, and played at tempi <br />that seem to represent the composer's intentions. The recording <br />quality is good, except for dynamics: the sound volume is <br />on the low side. One needs a high grade system for adequate <br />reproduction, especially given the wide dynamic range and  <br />timbral subtlety characteristic of Bruckner.
B000AMPZGC|4.0|I'm a fan of good Disney movie music.  While this movie is not \\"Disney\\"... the music, in my opinion, captures that same emotion.  I enjoyed the soundtrack (especially the score and the solo piano songs) and the movie was fun too. ;) <br /> <br />Elfman is a great composer.  The score in this soundtrack reminds me of several different movies; Edward Scissorhands, Shrek, Beetlejuice, and that song \\"Portabello Road\\" from Bedknobs and Broomsticks (for some reason).  It has that dark-happy, Disney's Haunted Mansion feel to it.  Not quite as strong, but still very good.  A solid 4 star soundtrack. <br /> <br />Well, there's my 2 and a half cents.
B000AL730O|5.0|This album is a keeper.  I have been listening to it constantly for several weeks now.         This is a great McCartney album that sounds like classic Paul through the ages - say 1967 - 1997.  That is a good thing.  It is much more enjoyable that Driving Rain.  The harmonies are are outstanding.  Over the past 8 years, I have found Ringo's new albums more listenable than Pauls, until now.  Paul is back!         Many people have priased the introspective and meloncholy tracks like Jenny Wren and Riding to Vanity Fair.  They are o.k., but I much prefer the up-tempo tunes.  Some of the best are:    Friends to Go - Probably my favoratie on the CD.  This starts out quietly like an acoustic solo and builds continously and joyously with added layers of orchestration.  Even though the subject may sound sad at first, it is presented in a way that makes the listener feel good.    English Tea - This is a beautifully orchestrated song that sounds like it could be part of a Disney soundtrack.  It would fit nicely into Mary Poppins.  The lyrics are simple, but the music is great.  My kids love this one too.    Fine Line - a nice song; it reminds me of the old song Accentuate the Positive - both in tune and subject.  It has a jazzy Flamming Pie arrangement which is very catchy.    Too Much Rain - This is melancholy, but uplifting.  It's another great song.  It sounds like vintage Badfinger.  It realy does sound like it could have been written by Pete Ham.  Since the Beatles mentored Badfinger, maybe sounding like Badfinger is not so bad.      Follow me and This Never Happened Before are the other good tracks.  Follow Me is a mid-tempo tune, and This Never Happened Before is a slower ballad that grows on you.    This album is a keeper!  I cannot understand why I have not heard some of this music on the radio.  Another reason to get the CD!
B00005JNQA|3.0|I was always brought up with the adage \\"if you cannot say something positive do not say anything\\" so here is my fors and against on this movie.<br /><br />Plus, Kidman and Penn are excellent in their chosen roles. Also it is good to see what all the money is being paid for in keeping the UN open.<br /><br />Minuses. It is a pretty incredulous plot. Someone who works in the UN can come and go without any evidence of their ever being there?  Thirty years ago someone of my acquaintance worked in Harrods in London where they worked on trust and where there was no such thing as a timeclock. The IRA bombed the store and the lack of accounting led to intensive searches for people who purportedly were at work but who had, instead, played hookey. They were found which reduced the death toll and the number of persons, missing, presumed killed, and timeclocks were introduced. Given the focus on the UN it is inconceivable that there were no records. Ditto for being able to leave personal belongings in an interpreters booth, in full view of the General Assembly podium. Never in a million years.<br /><br />No mention of diplomatic immunity anywhere and yet the Secret Service can come and go at will apparently in a foreign embassy without challenge or fear or favour. I do not think so. Foreign diplomats, accompanied by US agents but able to carry a weapon. Hmmm.<br /><br />The interviewing of a foreign national in their own residence by a person of the opposiite sex without a female officer present. No I do not think so either.<br /><br />Published details of an exiled opposition leader's preferred bus route. Really.<br /><br />An interpreter who can steal into the UN building, stay there all night without detection then be next to a head of state in a room with no security personnel, that is  more than a stretch.<br /><br />The most incredulous thing to me is the visit of two secret service officials to the home of a person of interest in search of that person. A chap answers the door but apparently has no english. The agents leave him a card but make no attempt to have him accompany them or call in the services of an interpreter, nor do they follow up. Not very likely is it?<br /><br />There are some poignant moments in this movie which deserve attention. Firstly the portrayal of the use of young boys as killers in Africa to commit murder against undesirables. This is quite commonplace in the horror of the conflicts going on in Africa and it is a facet which up  till now has received scant attention of much of the media to this appalling abuse.  We should be grateful, despite the norror of the notion, to this exposure of the problem.<br /><br />Mind you, the likelihood of the directors of the killings showing up with a government car and a military escort is pretty slim.<br /><br />Secondly the whole notion of the homemade bomb factory albeit it with high explosive bought from your local friendly arms dealer, is one which should send a chill down our spines. The hard truth is that it remains relatively easy to purchase the ingredients for homemade bombs in the US and our concern with personal privacy and constitutional rights should not blind us to the fact that we do not know what our neighbours are up to and we cannot always assume the best.<br /><br />Lastly the scene on the bus where the assassin leave the package, which goes unnoticed until it is too late shows how relatively easy it is to carry out such attacks. If we have not learnt through movies such as Blow Up and this one that we must be vigilant at all times, every waking minute of the day, then we must wonder what else must be done to shake us out of our complacency.<br /><br />This may not be the best movie in the world. In fact, in my view, it isn't.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />There are important lessons to be learned from it.<br /><br />Firstly the reality that this is an interdependent world and what we do is impacted by others.<br /><br />Secondly, it is easy to get caughtup in someone else's quarrels which can do us serious harm.<br /><br />Thirdly, we should always and everywhere be on our guard.>Secondly, it is easy to get caught up in someone else's quarrels which can do us serious harm. <br /> <br />Thirdly, we should always and everywhere be on our guard.

B0002DKCMG|5.0|I caught this movie on cable and IF you have to watch it be sure to catch it on Cinemax! THEY show the unedited, extended version HBO and Showtime show the edited version. The blooper reel while the credits are rolling is great! I love the little old lady giving advice to Scotty and Miki while they are making love in the confessional!<br /><br /> Now being over 30 yrs of age I would have to agree with some of the reviewers here and say that this movie is the Porky's of THIS generation. The comparisons with both the american pie series and girl next door is really stupid. This movie is a stand alone movie and should be view as such and with a open mind.<br /><br /> The story has been told over and over again in the reviews so IF you want or are looking for a rehash about it, read the reviews. Also Freddie Prince Jr and David Spade are too old to play in this movie but the producers did pick two new up and coming actors that will probably be the next generation Freddie Prince Jr and David Spade.<br /><br /> As for the reviews who think this is a career killer for Lucy Lawless, She is enjoying playing bit parts in movies like Spiderman and EuroTrip and making guest appearances on TV besides she is married to a movie director and will probably appear in minor roles in all his movies that he directs, that plus all the money she made playing Xena Warrior Princess. Lucy can afford to relax and take care of her two kids if she chooses.<br /><br /> I enjoyed this movie with the running joke in it about the song \\"Scotty doesnt know\\" and other running gags like the Pope watching his replacement on TV after being 'elected' within 10~20 minutes of his 'alleged' death and the little salutes to other movies and tv shows:<br /><br />  I.E. Cooper's white suit in that european night club paying homage to James Bond or Miki's step brother doing a hitler impersonation in the background while the father and Scotty talk in the foreground is like watching early episodes of Family Guy with Stewie doing something the the background while the adults talk in the foreground.<br /><br />  I wonder IF this movie was to be made now if the FIGHTING MANCHESTER UNITED would appear in the movie knowing what Malcom Glazer did to the team. (IF you live in Tampa the name is extremely familar to buc fans and taxpayers here) or the ending joke about the Pope's \\"death\\" would be changed or not.<br /><br /> Watch the movie and keep a open mind about it.tewie doing something the the background while the adults talk in the foreground. <br /> <br />  I wonder IF this movie was to be made now if the FIGHTING MANCHESTER UNITED would appear in the movie knowing what Malcom Glazer did to the team.

Be thankful the man is still making music. I'm sure the disc is full of great solos. Think about it for a minute - can you even comprehend how great and influential  this guitar player is? For ****'s sake, Jimi Hendrix followed him around and tape recorded him to study/copy. Please.

B000AA305M|4.0|White Ladder ranks as one of the best albums to come out of the nineties. Something about that record was magical, and left me yearning for more of Mr. Gray <br /> <br />His outings since then, while fantastic in their own regard, have yet to hit me with the emotive force of White Ladder. That is, until I popped in Life in Slow Motion. <br /> <br />His lyrical propensities have shifted from melancholy earlier in his career to downright sad. This album is not one to be listened to if one is seeking a pick-me-up. This is an album to be chewed up and digested as the beautiful laments of a man who sees much sadness in life, and knows exactly how to put them to fantastic music.  <br /> <br />Much of the appeal of this album for me is in the irony of the music and the lyrics. This is a dark album lyrically, but Gray has chosen to set these poems to apparently upbeat and positive sonic structures. It is a nice departure from more conventional musical/lyrical combinations.  <br /> <br />The album starts off much stronger than it finishes, with the first two tracks; \\"Alibi\\" and \\"The One I Love\\" marking two obvious highlights. \\"Hospital Food\\" is lyrically one of the best songs I've heard in a while, but the music falls a bit shy of turning this one into a classic. <br /> <br />This album only falls short in its production, which has a tendency to be overwrought (One of Gray's common problems). Indulgence behind a mixer is one thing, but when it comes close to overpowering the force of a singer/songwriter like Gray, too much of a good thing is....well, we all know the saying.
0441003257|1.0|Yes.  Indeed.  I read Good Omens some months ago, and was I disappointed. I should say so!  On the strength of my enthusiasm & admiration for Gaiman's compelling gift (eg, American Gods), my hopes were elevated & expanded beyond the capacity for their base to support & ... um, and ... ugh ... urghhh...<br /><br />[a period of hyperventilation ensues...]<br /><br />So anyway, Good Omens is typical of the later Hitchhiker books, the first two (maybe three, but I think not) of which were hilarious, but after them, my theory is that Adams came to think anything he wrote was rib-tickling & delightful, first draft (I think the later books must not have been workshopped, as were the earlier).  Likewise, MacDonald's \\"Fletch\\" series started out smart & funny, and ended with an irritating fizzle.  That's the same feeling I got from this book.<br /><br />I finished it only from a sense of duty.  Here's a clue, fellas: not everything is funny.  Witness this review -- just irritating.  Droll observation about contrived absurdity is insufficient to sustain a whole novel.  It'll do for a paragraph, just.  Dry British humor is one of my cups of tea, but this is not that.  An illustrative analogy follows: \\"Three's Company\\" is to farce, as not clever is to clever.  The book is so godawful that I'm tempted to avoid the Discworld series, which sounds pretty good from the reviews, but which is authored by Prachett, whom I blame for the horribleness and stinkitude of GO.  I mean, after all, it can't be Gaiman's fault.  He's a GOOD writer.<br /><br />& isn't my use of the ampersand annoying?
B00020HEG6|5.0|John Williams never ceases to amaze me with his ability to compose unique music.  Harry Potter @ the Prisoner of Azkaban soundtrack is a very good addition to anyone's soundtrack collection. <br />    <br />   There is a great degree of variation among the tracks.  Track three has a very jazzy, big band sound to it, while others like track seven use a recorder as the main instrument.  A fair share of action tracks are present, along with some moving pieces like the above said track seven.  All-in-all, this soundtrack has a great variation of music. <br /> <br />   I highly recommend this soundtrack to anyone. <br /> <br />
B000001Y79|5.0|I don't feel that there is anything I can say in this review that hasn't been said (even better) than what I would say.  This is a staple album.  It should be in every CD collection.  One of the best of the 90's.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Although I love music, I usually just listen to it on the radio.  I bought this album and I fell in love with it.  A lot of the songs are very exciting in that they start out with a particular sound or feel and then change into something different that you weren't expecting. <br />While I listen, I often find myself tapping my foot to the beat.  The lyrics are very interesting- a very cheerful sounding song can actually be saying something rather sad once one stops to take notice of the words.  \\"Take Me Out\\" and \\"Dark of the Matinee\\" are probably my favorite songs, but they're all notable.  The album seems to flow from one song right into the next, but that's not because they sound the same.  It's just a logical progression.  I look forward to hearing what Franz Ferdinand has in store for us in the future.
B000AA4M9U|4.0|Known as the \\"King of the Blues,\\" guitarist B.B. King, (short for \\"Blues Boy King\\"), who has been performing for well over half a century now, turned eighty in September of 2005. His album \\"80\\" was released just in time for the birthday party. King is known for his distinctive sound - especially his use of the sliding \\"bent\\" note, and for calling his electric Gibson guitar \\"Lucille.\\" And he sure loves making love to Lucille!<br /><br />A star studded cast of musicians join King for this celebratory album, including: Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, Bobby Bland, Billy Gibbons, Mark Knopfler, Elton John, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, Daryl Hall, and Gloria Estefan. This is far from my favorite King album. The great man's booming voice and uncluttered guitar style, liberal use of bends, his signature tremelo, tend to overpower those he performs with. His talent casts a huge shadow, making it difficult for others to shine as he does. The commanding performances here, and the enjoyment, are provided by Mr. B.B., and the much younger artists have to strive to keep up with him.<br /><br /> \\"Early in the Morning,\\" with Van Morrison is one of my favorite cuts and sets the bar high for those that follow. \\"The Thrill Is Gone,\\" with Eric Clapton's fabulous guitar solos and B.B. playing his vocal chords, is an outstanding track, as is \\"Funny How Time Slips Away,\\" with blues veteran Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland. Mark Knopfler (\\"All Over Again'') and Billy Gibbons (\\"Tired of Your Jive'') are also CD pluses.<br /><br />I am not at all thrilled with Gloria Estefan's \\"There Must Be a Better World Somewhere,\\" nor with John Mayer's treacley ballad \\"Hummingbird.\\" King's strong presence manages to salvage these pieces, however. And although I occasionally like Elton John, he cannot pull off \\"Rock This House,\\" even with help.<br /><br />King grew up sharecropping in the Mississippi Delta and learned to play gospel music on the guitar when he was a teenager. In the late 1940's he turned to playing blues and moved to Memphis, Tennessee to start a music career. He and his band toured almost non-stop, performing hundreds of shows a year. The birth of Rock & Roll music made stars of many black performers such as Little Richard, Fats Domino, James Brown and Chuck Berry. Unfortunately for B.B., \\"black\\" music, the blues, remained isolated from mainstream white America. He finally had a breakthrough success in the late 1960s, when white audiences began to discover the blues. Guitarists like Eric Clapton and Keith Richards sang his praises. B.B. King has recorded more than 50 albums, won 13 Grammys and received dozens of awards and honors over the years. Rolling Stone magazine recently named King as the third-greatest guitarist of all time, with Jimi Hendrix and Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band taking first and second positions. The technique of rock guitar playing is, to a large degree, derived from B.B,'s playing. Many great guitarists, like Bono, Clapton, and Richards pay tribute to him by dittoing that statement.<br /><br />I love the blues, have since I was a little kid. My Dad did too, so maybe I have \\"blues\\" genes. B.B. King is so special to me because he's the reason blues hit the mainstream. During a recent interview, King commented about his lack of interest in retiring, even at 80 years-old, afflicted, as he is, with diabetes and aching joints. \\"I couldn't afford to do it,' King laughed. 'I have days off, but we don't get airplay like other styles of music, so I learned at an early age that unless I go out and carry music to the people, it sure don't come to them by air.'\\"<br /><br />JANAblues and moved to Memphis, Tennessee to start a music career.

0684833395|5.0|Loved it loved it loved it.<br /><br />I'm not going to bother summarizing because it's been done too many times, I'll just say that it's an amazing piece of literature.  There is nothing wrong with this novel.  Not one word is remotely out of place.  I absolutely fell in love with the book and the characters and the author.  It's brilliant.<br /><br />That's all I can say.
1577312082|5.0|My brother gave me this recorded book two years ago and I listened a bit but it did nothing for me.  Then, this year, my family went through a health crisis and I had a hard time.  This book gave me deep insight into what was going on in my head and specific steps to deal with things.  So much in this book puts what I've experienced into perspective.  Sometimes, I start to think the book and its philosophy is simplistic, but it not...it's just sometimes truth comes with simplicity. <br />It's been a lifesaver for me.  Thanks Eckhart!
0440180295|5.0|Truly an American masterpiece.  This man knows what he's doing.  It's gripping and utterly fantastic.  I've read this book a few times for a few different classes and I've loved it everytime.  Vonnegut is a brilliant author and his characters are compelling and real.  Never a dull moment.  An exquisite read.
B00005JN5X|4.0|The Brothers Grimm is a suspenseful light-hearted ghost story in the cinematic tradition of such movies as Pirates of the Caribbean, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Sleepy Hollow. The brothers, played by Heath Ledger and Matt Damon, couldn't be more enchanting in their roles in this fairy tale movie. Jacob, played by spectacle toting Heath Ledger, is the lovable underdog, an impractical poet who wears his gold heart on his sleeve. Wilhelm of course, couldn't be more different as the devilishly dashing woman-chasing lead and older brother.<br /><br />The film is set in French occupied Germany and is quite amusing for history buffs. There, Jacob and Wilhelm have a run in with the French army. They've roamed from town to town making up fairy tales, but not only in the story sense! Jacob largely follows Wilhelm around documenting the folk tales of the various villages they weave their `magic' around. When they are captured, the scenes involving the French general (Jonathan Pryce) are classically macabre in every sense- I don't want to spoil any surprises so you'll have to see the movie to find out why. Caravaldi, a captain in that army, played by Peter Stormare, becomes a permanant pest and an unexpected side-kick. The character is completely absurd with an Italian accent, hilarious yet creepy.<br /><br />With Caravaldi, the brothers find themselves embroiled in a real mystery when all the girls in the village disappear. The townsfolk are strange but the boys eventually warm up to the female lead, Angelika (Lena Headey) who leads them through the forest and tells them of the folk tales of her youth. There's a little bit of that fairy tale magic mixed in with some European folklore which makes the movie interesting from an anthropological perspective... it makes you wonder what our folktales say of our history. The movie makes us imagine that these fairy or folk tales were real events, documented faithfully by the trusting Jacob. And there in the forest the brothers discover the truth behind the girls' disappearance, the connection with Angelika's missing father, and a wolf that has terrorized the forest.<br /><br />The Brothers Grimm is spooky and maybe a little scary/disturbing for young children but don't see the movie expecting a thriller- after all the movie is based on Grimm's fairytales. It's a lot of fun trying to guess which fairy tale is being alluded to in the various scenes as the Brothers seek to rid village of their haunting. And it is interesting how the movie weaves each story into another. There are great questions as to what is real and what is not... is it supernatural, a trick, magic?<br /><br />Magic there is, and chemistry too for sure in this entertaining movie. Lovers of fairy tales and ghost stories alike will find themselves falling in love with The Brothers Grimm! Hopefully, the DVD or movie will be out for Halloween.the truth behind the girls' disappearance, the connection with Angelika's missing father, and a wolf that has terrorized the forest.

0393312836|5.0|An absolutely amazing novel.  Breathtakingly beautiful, to those of us who are slightly twisted and love a little madness.  The language, although sometimes confusing, is truly beautiful, if you just take the time to read it.<br /><br />I'll admit, I read this originally for a lit class and I hated it.  I didn't get it at all.  Looking back, I think I hated the class, not the book.  And the professor, but we won't get into that.  I appreciated it, as a classic novel, but I didn't enjoy it at all.  However, because I am hardcore, I reread it about a year later on my own time and I absolutely loved it.  I think it was just a matter of slowing down and reading it for myself rather than for some class.<br /><br />So, kids, let this be a lesson to you.  Just because you hate it in high school or college ... does NOT mean it's bad ... it just means you need to reread it.  Dammit.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I am a little surprised at the hostility towards the film.  For all that it was I found it entertaining enough to get the DVD.<br /><br />Stuart Baird wanted to take the film in a different direction which he succeeded but I guess for some change is a bad thing.<br /><br />I would offer that probably the biggest problem was were the movie was going.  Is it an action film or one with an in-depth plot?  It seemed to try to do both and I think that is what caused problems for most people.<br /><br />One aspect of the film I liked was the introduction of the Remueans.  I also liked the ship used in the film.<br /><br />People have complained about Shinzon(Tom Hardy) but I kind of liked the character and I think the actor did a decent job at trying to have some of Picards mannerisms.  There is a feeling of a father son issue with the interaction between Picard and his younger clone.  I guess it was an attempt to \\"humanize\\" Picard by giving him nurture feelings as he never got married and didn't have children.  As he said at one point Star Fleet was his family.<br /><br />One aspect that I think will annoy the faithful is the fact that most of the characters from the series really don't have much to do in this film.  It is about Picard and Data.  There is a little humor especially from Worf (mutters \\"Irving Berlin\\" groan).<br /><br />It is the end of the line for Next Generation.  Some people wanted more.  I think the ending could have been better.  There is a deleted scene I think would have been nice if it was left in.  After seeing how they handled Kirks end, I guess they like going out with not a bang but a whimper.<br /><br />The extras should be viewed at least once as you get an idea to what Baird was trying to do.<br /><br />I guess if you never have seen this film, it might be a good idea to rent it first.  I would emphasize renting first for the hardcore followers.<br /><br />Now that the Enterprise TV series is gone and the fact it was canceled will probably mean no movies for that cast.  At least there are the DVD collections for people to get their Star Trek fix.  I have a feeling there won't be anymore movies for awhile.act it was canceled will probably mean no movies for that cast.

0060930187|4.0|I was slightly disappointed with this book.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I've always been told how incredible it is and how true it is.  As someone who suffers from depression, I was kind of bothered by it.  I realize it is a different time and and completely different world for women, but I didn't find it to be quite as accurate as it has been portrayed.  I lovely read, yes.  Beautifully written, yes.  Accurate portrayal of depression, eh, yeah ... weak yes.  Dark and moving, yes.<br /><br />I guess it just lost points because everyone has always talked it up ... and I had such high standards for it ... standards it failed to meet.
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|This movie somehow succeeds in being mildly amusing and entertaining.  I'm not really sure how it pulls this off, since it has more than enough negatives,  such as: <br /> <br />1) Adam Sandler, a 5' 7\\" Pro MVP Quarterback? <br />2) Many scenes that were supposed to be funny, such as Sandler with the Warden's secretary, that flopped. <br />3) Transvestite overkill.  First of all, I don't find a bunch a guys dressed in cheerleader uniforms and lipstick funny even once, but for those of you who do find this funny, is it still funny after the 40th camera shot?!?!  I had to endure this garbage over and over and after every play on the field. <br />4) Chris Rock being in only half of the movie. <br /> <br />However, Adam Sandler is alway able to pull off being likeable, and 1/2 of Chris Rock is better than no Chris Rock at all.  The action scenes were only average, but the movie succeeded in being somewhat likeable.  It's a 3 star choice, but it was very close to being a \\"2\\", thanks to those cheerleaders.
0786271531|4.0|I thought that this book was very good. It had that classic idea that the government will eventually own everything, including our memories. I don't know if I neccissarily agree with the idea of our government eventually becoming totally Nazi-ish but it's definately a possibility. There is also is the very interesting idea that people can hold other people's memories. While I have heard some folklore that poked at this idea, I have never read another book that so clearly and accurately depicted this idea in story format. All in all this is a good book and I would recommend it for children and adults, although some of the deeper aspects of the book might be hard for very young children to grasp.

0440237688|4.0|Can you remember a time in your life when you parents or teacher said to you \\"You're special, because there is no one else like you in the whole world\\"?   <br /> <br />Lois Lowry emphasizes this question in her novel about conformity and a completely controlled society called the Giver.  On a scale of 1-5, I rate this book a 4, because of its immortal lessons beneath the cover.  This book presents extremeties to which there is no hurt or pain, but also no love or true happiness.   <br /> <br />Jonas, the main character, is a boy who has entered his time to be \\"chosen\\" for his assigned job in his completely controlled community.  He is chosen as \\"The Receiver\\", which is the most honored job in the community.  \\"The Receiver\\" holds all memories to which the society over the years has chosen to do away with- all the memories which make life unique, including color, and most feelings and emotions.  Throughout the book we see Jonas emerge and realize these emotions are essential to a fulfilled life, even if the good comes with the bad.
B0000028RR|5.0|Amazing.<br /><br />Thats it.<br /><br />Just listen to this god damned thing, its flipping ridiculous its so good. How come these guys aren't around no more, this stuff was AWESOME! I believe this came out in '92 which makes it sound even more crazy, are these guys credited with starting rap metal? So good LOUD ANGRY MEATY sounds come out of these guys, all natural, no synthetics (nope, they just know how to do insane things with the instruments.)<br /><br />Sure the band is still around as AUDIOSLAVE, but that stuff doesn't compare a bit. Where the hell is ZACH DE LAROCHA, I heard he was doing a solo?<br /><br />You need to own this classic. Every song a keeper<br /><br />GET iT, PLAY IT and TEAR SOME SH*T UP!
B000002B7M|5.0|After being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Ozzy Osbourne became depressed, developed bipolar disorder, and delved deeper into his drug and alcohol addiction. Then two things happened: Sharon Levy (who would later marry Ozzy, and changer her name to Sharon Osbourne) became Ozzy's manager, and a young man by the name of Randy Rhodes stepped into his life, so Ozzy decided to launch a solo career. 1981's \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" was a great success, considering it was his first solo album.<br /><br />This album has definitely withstood the test of time, and it has also gone down in history as a heavy metal classic. Ozzy Osbourne achieved so much with his career in Black Sabbath, and \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" was the start of an equally successful and influential career.<br /><br />It may be mostly due to the inhumanly great musicianship of guitarist virtuoso Randy Rhodes, but this is one of the finest C.D.'s in my collection. And, as any metalhead will you, some of metal's all time best and most famous songs were penned on this record. Randy is capable of making noises with his guitar that I can't even make with my mouth! He is definitely one of the best and most influential guitarists EVER (influencing guitarists like Dimebag Darrell), and he is easily a better axeman than Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi.<br /><br />\\"Crazy Train\\" is an especially great stand out track. It is definitely one of the best and catchiest heavy metal songs ever written. And Randy's solo on this song, which has my vote for the best ever guitar solo, is so great, I can't even begin to describe it. You're just not metal if you don't know this song.<br /><br />But \\"Crazy Train\\" isn't the only great song on here, because every song is a hit. After an ominous intro, \\"I Don't Know\\" rockets into fast, running riffs. \\"Goodbye To Romance\\" is a pretty acoustic ballad, \\"Dee\\" is an acoustic guitar interlude, and \\"Suicide Solution\\" infamous for its controversial lyrics about suicide and substance abuse. Next, \\"Mr. Crowley\\" is another famous Ozzy song, with a pair of ascending solos (one of the solos was ranked #28 in Guitar World's \\"Best Guitar Solos\\" feature). \\"No Bone Movies\\" has chunky, Sabbath-y riffs, and \\"Revelation (Mother Earth\\") and \\"Steal Away (the Night)\\" are both strong tracks, as well, with the latter track sporting some catchy singing by Ozzy.<br /><br />And finally, \\"You Looking At Me (Looking At You)\\" appears on the 2002 remaster of this album, and it's definitely a great, toe-tapping track.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" is absolutely essential in every heavy metal collection. It's heavier than some albums from the 1980's, like any Van Halen release, but it's not as hard or fast as thrash metal records like Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood.\\" Thus, even if you don't like most metal from the `80's, you should still enjoy this album very much. And if you can't stand the sound quality of the original, and you're one of those fans who hates the 2002 remixed/remastered version, this 1995 remaster is the one to get., with a pair of ascending solos (one of the solos was ranked #28 in Guitar World's \\"Best Guitar Solos\\" feature). \\"No Bone Movies\\" has chunky, Sabbath-y riffs, and \\"Revelation (Mother Earth\\") and \\"Steal Away (the Night)\\" are both strong tracks, as well, with the latter track sporting some catchy singing by Ozzy.

B0000C8AW5|5.0|DYLAN and THE BAND. Thats all I should really need to say, always ballsy always loud, either way they do it. The Band was made for BOB DYLAN whenever the sound needed a little VOLUME!<br /><br />This is the only studio album that they all did together; its not as reckless as LIVE 1966 or BEFORE THE FLOOD live albums and its not raw like THE BASEMENT TAPES (all three of these are PISSAH discs).<br /><br />The Band is under control here (as by 1974 they were now proffesionals in the recording game) and the music is layered and weaved and really is just amazing.<br /><br />The songs to me resemble the style of NEW MORNING compositions but with extra balls here from THE BAND. Just a hell of a lot of sound, thats crisp and fresh. WAY MORE FUN THAN BLOOD ON THE TRACKS.....<br /><br />Yeah, I said it, get over it.<br /><br />Two versions of FOREVER YOUNG are necessary, so don't be tossed by that.. HAZEL and GOING GONE are slow and ballady but ripping with feeling; TOUGH MAMA and YOU ANGEL YOU are all about keeping it real NEVER SAY GOODBYE drips with guitar goodness,<br /><br />VERY EXCELLENT. Don't let anybody tell you this is a luke warm effort. ANYTHING that DYLAN and THE BAND did together is HOT!
B0002EXH54|5.0|Many music fans consider this to be one of thrash/speed metal's best records. \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\" is doubtlessly Dave Mustaine's first masterpiece. It is a classic, standard-setting album which is one of the best and most powerful and contagious releases of the 1980's (right up there with Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" and Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\"). The famous album opener, \\"Wake Up Dead,\\" has a pair of guitar solos, as well as a couple tempo changes, and \\"The Conjuring\\" is a catchy song, with fast, propulsive riffs. Next, the title track has more catchy, chugging guitars, several small solos, and an infectious sing-along near the end. \\"Devil's Island\\" and \\"Good Mourning/Black Friday\\" both have tasty solos (and \\"Good Mourning\\" also has a very catchy chorus and almost buzzsaw riffs). From front to back, this C.D. is very memorable and nearly perfect. It's a must own for every thrash and metal collection. The bottom line is, if you like heavy metal, why wouldn't you buy \\"Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?\\"? Plus, I strongly recommend getting the remastered version of this C.D. The four remixes at the end aren't anything especially interesting, but, overall, the album's sound quality is MUCH improved.
B000001IPL|5.0|Yeah, this album is OLD now! A girl I was friendly with in Junior High turned me on to this disc. OFFSPRING are a very accesible band anyway, but this is their easiest album. They just may be punk rock, but way more radio friendly (1994 style).<br /><br />They have manged to keep themselves relevant still in the music world but they won't ever meet the height of this one- They made themselves with this album. GOTTA KEEP EM SEPERATED!<br /><br />NO SELF ESTEEM was a rockin' song on the radio, even back then when I hated the radio. (yes I still hate the radio, but not as much as I did then) GOTTA GET AWAY is awesome and basically the whole first half of the album is rock solid.<br /><br />The second half slips a bit but not much. The whole album is good; the title track is last and it kicks....<br /><br />The announcer at the beggining and the end of it are worth one star at least. And the secret jam at the end is sweet.<br /><br />If the Clash can call LONDON CALLING a classic, then I believe this album is definatley a classic too. 5 stars.
0553378384|5.0|This is an excellent publication for anyone interested in such things.

B0009ZHJ7S|2.0|I don't usually buy cartoon DVD's but the last few that I have seen were funny and really good. I bought Robots because I am a HUGE Robin Williams and Halle Berry fan so I just knew that it was going to be great.  But when I watched it, there were only a few funny scenes, and then the rest were just okay.  I think that this one was only worth 2 stars because of Robin Williams and Halle Berry's acting. Otherwise, I could've left this one on the shelf and waited till it came on HBO or any of those cable channels.
B00000K413|5.0|Fans agonising over the inavailability of TFF's rogue single The Way You Are have plenty fo reason to buy this. Those who couldn't wait and bought this earlier without the bonus tracks, well, continue to be the victims of record companies (deliberate?) lack of foresight and generosity in programming their CDs. What's the excuse? At any rate this under-rated single more than lived up to expectations of a The Hurting follow up despite both the band and some of the critics here's feelings. It is a fantastic song, both lyrically with its minimalist intrigue (going far, getting nowhere... and the sound of machinery slows to a heartbeat, echoing ghost tunes made by those who whistle while they work...) and musically. This extended version is the ultimate bonus, giving the inventive rhythms and sounds time to breathe. One can be forgiven for thinking the original single weak, but with the extended version given here the song acquires greater expression and hence its strength. What is there not to love about this song - the compelling drums and rhythms, the imaginative bass by Curtis, the typically infectious TFF melodies, and Orzabal's cryptic lyrics? After this the next single Mother's Talk (or was it Shout) pales in comparison.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I didn't expect much from this movie after hearing what i heard about it and for about the first 45min. or so of the film i thought the assumptions were correct but after that the movie really picks up,if you liked Troy or even Alexander this movie is better than either of those.It may start slow to tell a story but hang in there you may be pleasently surprised!
B000002O4X|5.0|The music and arrangement is outstanding.  I never tire of the melody. I was in Africa several times and this music brings wonderful memories.  It is a treasured addition to my music/CD's <br />collection.
0451450523|5.0|I loved the movie as a kid.  A few years ago I read the book for the first time, and while the movie will always hold a place in my heart because of the nostalgia factor, I thoroughly love the book as well.  The writing itself is so fresh and alive, filled with unusual metaphors and quirky language.  The characters, at first glance, appear to be fantasy stereotypes--the heroic prince, the bumbling magician, the wicked king--but the author brings them all to life and gives them depth, dimension, human flaws and vulnerabilities as well as their own unique strengths.  It's lovely and haunting and surreal and sad, and ultimately, just a beautiful story.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|One of the things I love about Neil Young is that he so effortlessly divides people, even his fans (as the reviews of this album perfectly demonstrate). Me, I think this cd is fantastic. If you came to Neil via grungy old Ragged Glory, Mirror Ball, Sleeps with Angels or are a happily unreconstructed old rocker who only loves Neil for Rust Never Sleeps/Weld/Everybody Knows this is Nowhere, then maybe this one won't tickle your fancy as much. But if you got into him via Harvest/Harvest Moon/Silver and Gold/Comes a Time/After the Goldrush or saw the Greendale tour and thought it was a lot better than the studio versions of the songs, then I think you'll think this is a cracker too. It's got this wonderful combination of thoughtful reflection on songs like The Painter and Only a Dream, and a sort of mad joyous, want-to-jump-up-and-shout-for-joy vibe on songs like He Was The King and No Wonder. I've lived with this album for a month now and every time I listen it leaves me feeling happier than when I started out. I think this is his best album for a good 10 years or more. And it's so typical of Neil Young that more than a few people disagree very strongly.
B0006L16N8|5.0|definitely, not a single terrible track on here. perfect for a long car ride, not so great for a party situation or stuff like that. very relaxing, soulful music. best track is either \\"fix you\\" or \\"swallowed in the sea\\". it will soothe your soul! maybe
B00079FUI6|5.0|As an avid Desperate Housewives viewer every Sunday night, I ordered the DVD set as soon as it became available on Amazon. I find that as much as I love the episodes on TV, I enjoy them even more on DVD. The episodes flow well, are ten times more enrapturing without the commercials, and are of a high quality. The extras are fun, especially Bree's multicultural dinner party where you hear the characters talking in a variety of languages, and I love the extended episodes. It's interesting to see what you've missed with cut scenes, and the extra scenes add a whole new dimension and further your understanding of the sordid goings-on of Wisteria Lane. They've also done an excellent job of packaging the DVDs, and while there may be six of them they're easy to keep track of. I'd recommend this DVD set to any Desperate Housewives aficionado, or anyone who's seen an episode here and there and wants to get started on the series. Once you start watching, you won't want to stop!
0802136834|5.0|Another testament to Weir's hard work and writing style, this book is chock full of relevant research to support the tale woven about each of Henry VIII's six wives.  I'm not one to read non-fiction but my interest in British history has led me to Weir's books and I was not disappointed.  A large portion of the book is dedicated to the stories of Henry's first wives (Katherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn) but that is not to say that the other four were skimmed over.  On the contrary, I was given a good look at each of these women and what attracted them to the King and to the people.  The book flowed well and was not difficult to read at all.  A pleasure, overall!
B000001GK9|1.0|I can understand all the praises poured down on this recording.  The recording is almost magical and the orchestral playing leaves nothing to be desired.  It is just like the Sports Illustrated Annual Swimsuit Issue.  The girls are so pretty, sensuous, and beautifully photographed.  And Yes, both are utterly devoid of spiritual communication while still remaining attractive.  The Immense Hollow is probably the only thing Karajan delivers, as he does most of the time.  There are many great recordings of Mahler Ninth, Klemperer, Boulez, young Bernstein, and even Abbado with Mahler Youth Orchestra, for example, which will surely amaze you at the very personal level.  This recording is a true Hollywood version of Mahler Ninth, although some people mistakenly label Bernstein with that name.  If you need to buy Karajan's record, I would recommend his Vienna New Year's Concert.  That was the only time I found Karajan really satisfying.
0920668372|1.0|This book is about a mother who doesn't realize her bouncing baby boy grew up into a man and has no identify other than her role as a mother. To think this womam rocked her teenage son with a nursery rhyme is creepy. To think this woman climbed into her grown son's home and into his bed to rock him to sleep borders on pyschotic and incestual. If my MIL tried climbing through our windows, she would be taken for a burglar and shot.    This is a mother who clearly needed someone to shake her by the shoulders and advise the umbilical cord to her child was severed many moons ago.
B00005UJ96|4.0|Of the two albums by Trees, this, The Garden Of Jane Delawney, is more traditional sounding than their second album \\"On The Shore.\\" It's not as hard rocking, much mellower, but still a brilliant album with some great lead guitar solos, and Celia Humphris vocals are just amazing, beautiful and incredible voice.<br />Their is one song on here that Jimmy Page stole the main guitar parts for, and then used it in the song he calls \\"White Summer,\\" but it's actually taken from the traditional folk song \\"She Moves Through The Fair,\\" which Davey Graham covered along with Bert Jansch, who was one of Page's acoustic influences. It's not a surprise that Page stole from that song as well as tons of others. He simply should not have got credit for being the writer of that song, and Led Zeppelin would also play \\"White Summer\\" live in concert. Their is even a website that describes how Jimmy Page & The Yardbirds ripped off other groups/artists of songs, and also Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />The Garden of Jane Delawney is quite different in my opinion from their second album \\"On The Shore,\\" but I still like and enjoy it very much, it definitely has it's moments, and I think the best thing about this album is some of the great guitar work, and of course, fantastic female vocals from Celia Humphris. But I think that \\"On The Shore\\" is a much better and stronger album, it's not as mellow as this, but this still is an excellent album and worth having. Glenn Signal Hill,CA USA
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Yet another solid bunch of songs from Death Cab. It's been a while since Transatlanticism came out, but it was worth the wait.  There are plenty of quality tracks on Plans, and I find myself listening to the whole CD all the way through; much like I did and still do with Transatlanticism.  I've seen some reviews that bash Death Cab for signing with a major label, but as long as they keep making good music I couldn't care less.  Buy Plans today.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I've had this CD for a couple months now, and I've got to say it's really grown on me. Well..to be specific, about half of it has grown on me. The other half just won't stick. <br /> <br />As with their last couple of albums, 'Octavarium' could benefit from a little helpful editing. There are 4-minute sections of songs that could easily be cut out. I wish that they would either adopt a 'lean & mean' approach on their next album, or release a separate CD with the 'radio edits' of all the songs. <br /> <br />One last note: The title track was such letdown. It could have been a Floyd-esque classic...but there's just nothing there (except for yet another boring, song-length Jordan Rudess solo). It's one of the thinnest songs they've ever done.  <br /> <br />Aside from the music, the CD booklet contains some of the best artwork that Hugh Syme has ever done. I'm really glad he's finally hooked up with DT.
B000683VI4|5.0|Set in the 1940s-1950s, this is a wonderful nostalgic film set in the Southern states of the US and that captures that time well from the experience of both upper and working classes.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mc Adams are gorgeous in this and if you love romance, this film has TENSION, great tension and an almost 'epic' feel to it.    Whilst the romance genre here may be formulaic, Gosling and Mc Adams completely distract us from any sense of predictability and formula.  Gosling perhaps in particular, has a power similar to Natalie Press in My Summer Of Love to be so in his own world in his style of acting that you almost are in the room, as if you know this guy.  If you hate romantic comedies and think romance is not your thing, this film may actually change that view.  Gosling isn't soppy and is tangible as a 'real guy' making this film avoid the pile of 'womens movies'.  I know men who hate romance films who've watched it and loved it.
1878424319|4.0|Hey Dummies!! The Toltecs werent the Native Americans who built the temples of Ancient Mexico. The Toltecs are the name of the scientists and artists of Old Mexico who banded together to preserve the ancient wisdom of the past. They handed the wisdom down for thousand of years throug oral stories collected by the naguals, another name for Toltec shamans. Don Miguel Ruiz is one of these naguals. <br />  The Naguals believed that people live in a hell of thier own creation. And it is very easy to escape this hell. Change the way you think, the way you dream, and they way you act. Four very clear and simple rules are laid down for improving the lives of readers of the Four Agreements. Once you make the Four Agreements to change your behavior you are already on your way to changing your life to discovering your true self. The Four Aggreements Are: <br />   1. Imppeccabple Word. Don't talk crap and gossip loaded with emotional poison about people. Use your speech to express yourself not to demolish another persons personality. <br />   2. Don't take anything personally. This one will save you from a lot of fights with people and will make it impossible for you to want to take a baseball bat and break someone's skull <br />   3. Don't make assuptions. This one will also save a lot of heartbreak. We have a tendency to just the world by our own warped standards and then take it for granted that everyone else shares the same beliefs <br />   4. Always Do Your Best. This ones important too. Never give up the fight, live every day like it matters.  <br />   The most interesting idea in the book was the idea of Mitote, the Toltec Word for the fog and confusion the clouds the humun mind. Mitote is the resutl of domestication. It is a virus, consisting of the thousands of little voice we have internalized and incorporated into our perception over the last several thousand years. Mitote is the source of rebellion. Spiritual Warrors spend thier lives fighting against the illusionsof Mitote. Anyone who takes the oath to fight the Mitote will have the war of lifetime on his hands.  <br />
6305622914|5.0|This film is hilarious, moving, exciting.  Here the men are not backdrops to beautiful women.  This is the kind of film where guys can almost see themselves in one or more of the marvellous characters that end up making up this cast of would be male strippers.  But if you're thinking perfect bodies, think again... this is gritty, not beautiful.  The only beauty is in its absolute capacity to shake you and move you and it does that brilliantly without a doubt.  Another film in this genre is Tap Dogs and I'd recommend both as films that will equally appeal to men and women, straight and gay alike.

B0009ZHJ7S|2.0|Robots is what happens when you take a simple story, put it in the hands of talented animators and an exceptional case of actors to provide the voices; and then just allow the project to drift.  For all its promise, the movie just falls flat on its face.  I'm guessing that there was no strong guiding force with a coherent vision to bring all of it together.  Read on and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />The story is simple enough, \\"young robot inventor heads off to the big city to make good, encounters evil corporate titan that has unseated the benevolent founder of his business, and struggles to make things right.\\"  Rodney Copperbottom wants to become an inventor for Big Weld Industries, and work for his idol, Mr. Big Weld -- whose philosophy has always been to make life better for the common robot.  The overall vision of this alternative robot universe is quite compatible with the far, far better Monsters Inc., but the details just seem to get jumbled.  Consider the transportation system of Robot City, which combines elements of the game MouseTrap, pinball arcade games and gyroscopic toys from the 50's.  It all makes for a great visual, and a chuckle or two, but does little to advance the story.<br /><br />The animation is detailed and well done, perhaps a little too well done.  The detail is extraordinary, and I suspect it looked great on a movie house screen.  But viewing it on DVD, you're tempted to hover over the pause button just to answer the many \\"what the heck was that in the background?\\" questions.  But again, these little details do little more than generate a smile or two, while the story just limps along.<br /><br />That brings us to the cast.  Ewan McGregor and Greg Kinnear provide the voices for Rodney and his nemesis Ratchet, and they do a good job with generally bland material.  But the tragedy of this production is that someone recruited Robin Williams and Mel Brooks (arguably two of the funniest men on the planet), and then gave them sober pills!  Whereas on Disney's Aladdin, Williams was given free rein to adlib and build his character, on can almost see the script supervisor hovering over him as he stood at the microphone reading his lines for Robots.  The same with Mel Brooks, the voice is there but the jokes obviously came from someone else.<br /><br />It's not necessarily a bad movie, but it's not worthy of the popularity that the previous work from this creative team (Ice Age) turned out.  It ends up looking rushed and pieced together, and never really makes a connection with the audience.pills!

0393324818|5.0|OK - I'm not a baseball person.  I'm a rugby person.   <br /> <br />But that's ok, because to my mind what we have here is a brilliant book on business and investing.  In fact I'd go as far as to say that this is one of the best books on business and investing that I've read.  And I thought it was going to be a baseball book.  Pretty cool huh! <br /> <br />Moneyball is a story about how the Oakland A's have managed to win so many baseball games.  Conventional baseball wisdom would have you believe that they shouldn't win very many games because they don't have much money and therefore can't afford the best players. <br /> <br />But the way the A's have won so many games is by finding value in players that other people have overlooked.  The way they manage that is by looking at and interpreting the statistics that are used to measure a player's performance in a new way.  What the A's have done (primarily out of economic necessity, as they are a small-market team) is to question all the traditional statistics that get used to evaluate players.   They've challenged the traditional measures and asked if they really are a good way to measure what a particular player brings to a team and how much that player contributes to winning. <br /> <br />Now the interesting thing is that it turns out that the traditional measures are not very accurate.  It turns out that you can find much better ways to measure value if you are prepared to think about the game contrary to conventional wisdom.  In this way you can find value that other people have missed. <br /> <br />Imagine that!!  A game like baseball that has been played for 100 years or more in full view of everyone.  There are plenty of people in the game who know what they're doing (or think they do).  Books have been written.  Players have been studied.  And baseball being baseball, there is a statistic for just about every move that a player makes.  Everyone thinks they know everything there is to know about the game.   Butno - it turns out that there are new ways to look at things and new ways to evaluate what contributes to winning.  And it turns out there are better ways to do things.  <br /> <br />Ok, so what's the connection between this and an investor buying shares? <br /> <br />Well, investors are trying to do exactly the same thing that the Oakland A's have done.  Investors are looking to find value that the market has not seen.   <br /> <br />Let me give just one example. <br /> <br />In baseball, people have been told forever that batting average is the most important metric for a hitter.  Well, as we learn in Moneyball, it turns out that when you actually look at history and determine what is the thing that is the most highly correlated with the number of runs that a team scores, batting average is very low on the list.  Talk about a revelation.  There are a lot of teams that have high batting averages who never get on base with walks and who don't hit for power.  Compare that to a team that gets on base more often with a lower batting average but more walks and that also hits plenty of home runs.  Who do you think scores the most runs at the end of the day?  A big deal was made of the wrong number.  It's been that way for decades in baseball and persists even today.  And this created a huge opportunity for the Oakland A's.  Players with high on-base percentages (made up of a decent, but not spectacular, batting average plus loads of walks) are mispriced by the market. <br /> <br />The lesson is that there are plenty of magic numbers that a big fuss is made over in the financial markets also.  For example, many investors and analysts focus on things like earnings targets or the price/earnings ratios.  Of course, many of these metrics are important and do help to accurately measure the health of a company.  But is possible to think about things differently? <br /> <br />Investors, just like baseball's general managers, have to start asking if there is some better number, some better way to measure how a company is doing.  Is there another way to think about things?  Investors who like to look for the unloved, unknown and undervalued companies will find plenty here to think about. <br /> <br />And I bet these lessons are applicable to a great many things other than baseball and investing - always take the time to consider if what you are doing makes sense; don't do it just because \\"this is the way things have always been done\\"; don't be afraid to ask \\"why\\"?; and be curious about the unwanted and the unloved because if nobody else wants them then they are probably undervalued. <br />
B00008CLOA|5.0|I wouldn't want to re-write what has been said about this legendary recording. It's quite simply the best effort from PF and in my honest opinion, the best sounding SACD I have ever listened to. The discrete 5.1 channel seperation is divine and the clarity is breathtaking! Enough said, if you're a true PF fan, why dont you have this CD?

I saw him earlier this year in Orlando and believe me he is even more amazing live.  He's coming to Miami and I will have front row tickets again.  John is rare talent.  His voice, his aura, and vibe is simply one of a kind.  I am waiting on edge for his next release.  GO buy this CD NOW...Better yet find out if he is visiting a city near you and get that ticket...you wil not be disappointed.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Wow...this movie is breathtaking...sure it might be a little kooky and over-the-top at times...but that's what makes it so great, loveable, funny, and re-watchable. The dancing is spectacular when it needs to be and highly sensual and romantic when the script calls for it.<br /><br />This is a movie that stirs up genuine emotions for me. The \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps\\" by Doris Day scene is simply inspired. The cast is fabulous...especially Paul Mercurio (lead character, Scott), as well has his love interest Fran (played by Tara Morice). I also give special note to Scott's mother, and his initial dance partner, Liz. The romance is impossibly sweet, and also very believable.<br /><br />Very funny...one of my all-time favourites. For people who like to escape and be taken on a fabulous journey when watching their movies :) This movie is pure HOTNESS.

0465043550|1.0|Mandelbrot has been pushing his fractals longer than most of us have been around. They might well describe the markets better than the CAPM but do they predict better is the key question? William Sharpe, who \\"invented\\" the CAPM, makes this very point on his home page. The CAPM captures risk and return, albeit imperfectly but what does Mandelbrot capture? Certainly not an audience as his theories will remain tangential until they have practical use. He wil always be at the frontier until his theory has a practical application, something for good and bad the CAPM has.<br />The normal curve, is, with the lognormal distribution, the entry point to the world of heavy tails and quirkier distribtions and these are all used in markets world wide every day of the week; even the CAPM is widely used in corporate risk assessment. Ditto the imperfect Black Scholes model which allows us to predict, accurately enough for our purposes, the price of a European call, and thence a put etc etc. Although improvements have been have been made, it is like mother nature: unless the improvements give us better predictability, they are probably not worth the effort. Because the BS model gave us that predictability, it is widely used. Until Mandelbrot can do the same, his work will remain tangential at best, irrelevant at worst.
0440238609|5.0|Don't believe teh other reviews - these books are NOTHING like Harry Potter.<br /><br />Based on John Milton's poem _Paradise Lost_, the _His Dark Materials_ trilogy tells the story of a young girl, Lyra Belaqua. Orphaned after her parents were murdered, she is raised by the professor's at Oxford, under the sponsorship of her Uncle, the distant and troubling Lord Asriel. Lyra loves her life at Oxford, she, her daemon Pantalaimon or \\"Pan\\" for short, and her best friend Roger run wild, tormenting the kitchen staff, waking the ghosts of deceased Oxford dons, and warring with the gypsy children.<br /><br />Then, the children of Oxford begin to disappear. Rumors of \\"Gobblers\\" begin to circulate, and Lyra and her friend Roger are both veryfrightened, but also intent on soving the mystery. But with each answer found, more questions spring up: who are the \\"Gobblers\\"? and what of these \\"severed children\\" Uncle Asriel talked about? And why are the oxford Dons trying to do away with Asriel? Lyra and Roger dedicate themselves to tracking down these answers, until the \\"Gobblers\\" reach Oxford - and one of their own goes missing.<br /><br />Then it's a race to the North. Asriel is taken prisoner by the Panzerbjorn - yes, that's \\"Armored Bear\\" - but how much he has them prisoner is uncertain. Lyra is taken under the wing of the lovely Mrs. Coulter, but then runs away when she finds out that Mrs.Coulter is not as lovely as she seems. She and Roger pair up with the gypsies, accompanied by a witch clan from the north, and they meet Iorek  Byrnnison, dethroned monarch of the Panzerbjorn. It's one adventure after the next after the next . . .and that's only half way through the first book.<br /><br />My heart never stopped racing reading these books. Lyra is a character wholely unlike any that I have met in any fantasy novel. It is so rare to come across a young heroine who has such an unconquerable, adventurous spirit; a girl, who though she finds any excuse to get out of her studies, is as smart as a whip, who cares so deeply for people and yet has such an insatiable sense of vengeance, whose curioisity never ends, and who can find trouble around any corner, and save the day at the last minute (I think that was a whole lot of mixed metaphors there, but you get the message.)<br /><br />And there are other amazing characters as well - the fierce Panzerbjorn with their armor of Sky iron, and the witch clans, who can cross into different worlds at will. The Gallavespians were by far my favorite - tiny blue bings no bigger than a hand, who ride on dragonflies and can fit into the smallest cranny to spy on anything, but who are burdened by a lifespan of only ten years.<br /><br />These books are incredibly complex, beautiful works of fantasy,a dn though they are kept often in teh YA section of bookstores, may be frightening for children younger than 12.

0517548232|1.0|This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics. If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaugh's readers or helpers writing a primer on economics, then this is it. Keep government small etc. The author most likely was an Austrian school follower. As it is avaiable free on Limewire, maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library. No need to buy unless you want to flesh out (sic) the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al. The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall, self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad.
B00009ATIX|4.0|The story comes from Stanislaw Lem, a Polish science fiction writer of a few decades ago. In orbit aroud the alien planet Solaris, bizarre things have started to happen to the crew. A security team goes to address the problem and vanishes without a trace. Then, one of the crew calls back to Earth, asking for the one person that may be able to solve the problem: Chris Kelvin, a clinical psychologist. If anything, he gets more deeply wrapped up in the problem than any of the original crew. In the end -- well, I'm not quite sure what.<br /><br />This movie is very well put together, with good visuals and good performances portraying some people who've become very strange. It's not an action movie - not by any stretch of the term's meaning. It's moody, brooding, and claustrophobic. It may also be George Clooney's \\"ego movie,\\" the one that never would have been made except that Clooney had made his pile of money and his box office reputation, and use those to push it through. Somehow, it comes across as a big-budget movie with an indy feel.<br /><br />Not everyone will like this. I do. It has a great look, a very different pace than the usual, and a surreal sense that seems true to Lem's writing, even if the story isn't quite the same.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005ATQ9|3.0|Barry Lyndon is not a very good person, but he isn't especially villainous, either.  He isn't very sympathetic, but not very unsympathetic.  Bottom line, he isn't very interesting, and you may not want to spend three hours with him.  The movie is sumptuously staged and beautifully filmed, but in the end, it is rather a sterile exercise.<br /><br />Ryan O'Neil plays Barry Lyndon with very little personality, almost like a zombie.  Lady Lyndon, played by Marisa Berenson, has no personality whatsoever; they could have saved money by using a mannequin for the part.  With Thackery's story, this movie could easily have been a bit more exciting, but Kubrick seemed to take a perverse delight in making it boring.
B000002KDG|5.0|It's hard to believe this music is more than a quarter century old now. I think it would recieve the same kind of accolades if had come out yesterday. But it didn't. It came out in the summer of 1979. It was the summer before my sophomore year in college, my first summer away from home. For at least a week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select side 1 of \\"Rust Never Sleeps.\\" It took me at least that long to flip the darn thing over. And then, when I did, for the next week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the turntable, I'd select Side 2 of \\"Rust Never Sleeps.\\" My flatmates never complained. <br /> <br />Oddly, the songs I see getting the most grief in the reviews here are my faves. You don't really want to do without the swooping lead guitar, contagious handclaps, and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus of \\"Welfare Mothers,\\" now, do you really? As for \\"Sedan Delivery,\\" I have only the vaguest clue of what it's about, but it's sure a scorcher (and it's still hard to find a job). Allright, maybe we don't need two versions of \\"Hey Hey, My My,\\" but which one would you delete?  <br /> <br />As far as I'm concerned, there's only one song here that hasn't withstood the test of time: \\"Sail Away,\\" which is innocuously pretty, but lacks the bark and bite of even the other acoustic stuff. \\"Trasher\\" and \\"Pocahontas\\" are both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places. Poor Marlon, poor CSN. <br /> <br />Do I wax nostalgiac? Perhaps, but not overly so. This remains essential Neil, which is to say as essential as rock 'n roll gets. It still sounds fresh and relevant. And fun. Did I mention fun? In fact, I'm gonna go plunk it on right now, maybe take a breather between \\"Sail Away\\" and \\"Powderfinger\\" to relive the LP experience. You should too. <br />
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|The second season of the Gilmore Girls is a shining example of television at it's best and it is one of the pinnacle seasons of this show in particular. Back before Rory went to Yale and the series became ho-hum and not something I would take time out of my day to watch, the first three seasons show the brilliance of the program. The small-town humor, the banter between mother and daughter (face to face, not over the phone) and the crazy secondary characters that become less and less present as time goes on. Sookie, Jackson, Babette, Miss Patty, all the ingredients for a great combination. I wish the show could restore it's former brilliance, but if it can't we have these great DVDs to fall back on!
B00005JNTX|1.0|While Sin City is an exceptionally stunning film its pathetic attempt at plot and character development falls flat. It is visually compelling but empty of meaning, interest and emotional impact. While I was captivated by the first twenty-minutes or so, I soon became bored and found the visual effects grating and annoying. The characters (and the actors themselves) are often quite beautiful (Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy) but not in the least bit engaging. There is not a character in the entire movie that holds any emotional appeal whatsoever and, while the film features some incredibly fine actors (Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis, Nick Stahl, etc.) all are wasted in thoroughly unlikable, one-dimensional roles. Many found this movie to be overly violent and, to a great extent, I agree. The violence is intense, but as cartoonish and one-dimensional as the characters who commit it. Yet the saddest part is that it was violence for the sake of violence (think the opposite of movies like The Godfather or Saving Private Ryan) and, as a result has no emotional resonance. Instead it is simply depressing and unpleasant. In general I found the movie to be pointless and extremely over-hyped. It resembles a comic book (or, if you prefer, \\"graphic novel\\") in every way: beautiful, shallow and deceptively hollow.

0316172324|3.0|It's good to exposed to Gladwell's thinking.  It can stretch you a bit. <br /> <br />And we need to encourage good writing-that is, writing that is clear, intelligent, and crisp. <br /> <br />All that said, there's little other than the above of value.  It's remarkably thin,  actually, especially on reflection.  His apparent point of view is that snap judgments are good, except when they aren't. <br /> <br />And everything he offers suggests that snap judgments-or at least those he discusses-are neither snap nor judgments.  They are conclusions based on years of experience. <br /> <br />In the end, this book dissolves into very little.  You cannot say you learned much from it, or even were coaxed toward deeper understanding and insight.  All you can say is that you may, or may not, have enjoyed the ride. <br /> <br />That books like these are our best sellers may be the most compelling information to glean from all of this.  There's not much here here, to steal and paraphrase from Gertrude Stein.  .  <br /> <br />All this said, I will at least scan his next book, simply because the author gets access to some interesting studies on human behavior.  We're better served by his New Yorker articles, not  least of all because they are as long as they need to be to impart the information.   <br /> <br />Maybe a 3.5.  And I do hope he keeps reporting, because he covers what others do not.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I'm not going to compare this album (Takk) with the previous works. I think in and of itself this album shows off the creativity and vision of Sigur Ros once again. <br />\\"Saeglosur\\" is probably their most beautiful song. The turning point of the song played at a high volume sends chills down your spine unlike anything you've heard. \\"Milano\\", \\"Glosoli\\" and \\"Svo Hljott\\" all deliver the goods. This is the best band that I probably can't share with everyone I know. There is a chance Sigur Ros finds their place in the spectrum of American music, but they're a virtual lock to never be too pop or corporate. <br />Their songs make you think about your own birth, your own death, your future that excites you, and your past that haunts you. <br />A real treat in today's times.
B000002OR4|5.0|John Williams has come such a long long way from the time when he was composing for t.v. shows such as \\"LOST IN SPACE\\", \\"TIME TUNNEL\\" and other television series. (He was known as \\"Johnny Williams\\" then).  I have always enjoyed his music because of the spark his scores added to anything you were watching.  You can usually tell his scores however, after the first 2 or 3 measures therefore some of the things have a tendency to sound alike.  It's very very commercial yet pleasant.       This is something altogether different.  It's a true departure from his usual music, which is a breath of fresh air.  You'd never know it was his score if his name were not on it. (But since he and Speilberg are joined at the hip it had to be John Williams now didn't it?)  There is such a strong ethnic feel to it that suits this film that I cannot imagine the movie without it.   I'm a sucker for high strings and the phenomenal Itzhak Perlman to begin with but this score makes me cry like a baby.  It brings tears to my eyes every single time I hear it.  The delicate accompaniment of the orchestration to Mr. Perlman's magnificent solos is subtle enough to add to the mood of the pieces and not overwhelm this in the least bit.   (Thank God he pulled back on his signature use of horns).  I love to listen to this during the Jewish High Holy days in October.  (Rosh Hashanah thru Yom Kippur) when the leaves are falling and it's rainy.     This is truly one of my favorite soundtracks.  It's very moving, so much so that I can't listen to it as snow is falling.  (If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about.)  It's hauntingly beautiful and I wish he'd do scores like this more often.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This is such a strange movie.  The first time I saw it, I got bored and left.  But now (many years later), I own the DVD, and it gets better each time I watch it.  I can't put my finger on it, but there is just something about this movie.  I think it might be the part when the police chief nails Lebowski in the head with a coffee cup.  Perhaps.
B0002858YS|3.0|When I first heard Somebody Told Me while riding with a friend, I was turned off to this band. Frankly, the song was ridiculous lyrically, as has been stated a few times in other's reviews, and the rhythm was generic and uninteresting. I ignored The Killers, writing them off as another crap band churned out to entertain preteens.  <br />However, when I next experienced them (hearing Jenny Was A Friend OF Mine at work,) I realized there might be potential. After picking the CD up, I've gotten more mixed impressions. Some tracks stand out far more than others, with some very thoughtful lyrics (particularly Andy You're A Star,) and some great sounds (All These Things I've Done.) On the other hand, some cuts are as terrible as Somebody Told Me, with bland beats and inane lyrics that crib from every other cookie cutter band today.  <br />Overall, I'd say 3 stars would be a fair rating for the album. Worth a listen by anyone, but don't expect perfection all the way through. Hopefully a sophomore release with correct the flaws, and impress further.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have loved the story of the Phantom since I was a child.  I have seen Tony Richardson's 1999 adaptation and Universal's 1943 Technicolor film (Susannah Foster & Nelson Eddy).  There are also two silent films- Universal's 1923 b/w version and Delta's 1925 b/w version recently out in DVD.    Joel Schumacher's movie theatre version is, by far, the grandest of its kind.  The staging is lavish, the costuming is gorgeous, the acting is consumate, and the voices are heavenly.  Long after the credits have run, Andrew Lloyd Weber's songs linger in your mind.  Emmy Rossum's Christine is perfect, for in the original book, she was a young teen woman. Gerard Butler was menacing and brooding, but not as grotesque as in the orginals/book.  Patrick Wilson played Raoul well, but his part is not a spine-tingling heroic one.  Minnie Driver's Carlotta is over the top, a bit overdone.  All other principal characters are well played.      This version of The Phantom captures the grandeur often lost in a retelling of this story.  Since the story is different from pervious versions as well as from the stage version and the book, it stands in a category all its own.  It is beautiful, magnificent, and well worth the investment for your video library!
0375405380|5.0|A woderful rendering in fictional form of the CIA's involvement in South America & Central America during the Reagan and senior Bush presidencies.  A thriller with a message. If you remember the Reagan years and the CIA shenanigans in Nicaragua and the Iran-Contra affair and all the phony denials by the Reagan and Bush administrations, then you will realize this is not only a very good thriller, but also realistic historical fiction from an embarrassing moment in U.S. history.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|This is a great series.  I couldn't stop watching.
0763619612|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  It not only entertains, but teaches children that their own artistic expressions are valuable.  It's a \\"feel good\\" book that children and adults will love!!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly isn't a perfect show, especially in it's first, and only, season. It tends to never really explain why the government is so bad, nor does it give, much, of a progression between any of the characters. Although in it's favor, it is an expertly written and incredibly addictive piece of fiction. Firefly if given the chance, for more seasons on air, it did would have been an amazing piece in fiction, but as it stands, because it failed to find a mainstream audience, Firefly-The Complete Series is a fun footnote in sci-fi history that deserved better.
B00000099Y|5.0|I am a christian with very strong beliefs and I've heard many reviewers say that if you are Christian stay away from this album.  Personally I think this album is genius and gives you alot to think about.  On the surface it may seem like Maynard is constantly bashing Jesus and religion, but I think people need to study these lyrics closer, and Christians need to not be afraid to have their beliefs challenged.  This album is amazing on all levels.  One bit of advice for new tool fans...you really have to listen to the album many times to get into it.  It took me at least 10 run throughs before I could appreicate its brilliance.
0783117523|5.0|Nothing to complain about. <br />The item arrived in due time and in very good condition and packaged excellently.
B0001HLVS2|3.0|First, let me say that I have been told to watch this movie for quite a while now. And when I finally got around to watch it, I thought it was somewhat of a letdown.    The acting, set, story, action, etc. were all really good, but it just didn't do it for me. I guess it was a lack of depth and closure.. Plus the movie seemed to drone on 3/4 way through.    I would highly recommend the \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" series from A&E if you like this type movie. Those series will give you more to chew on.. and are historically accurate, etc.    In conclusion, I believe my mediocre feel about the movie has more to do with underdeveloped everything. The story was kinda/sorta there. The characters, while rich were not very well developed. You get no real history or genuine feel. It doesn't really seem to go deep (pardon the pun) enough.
B000002JSP|5.0|WOW!  This is a great record.  Many people have led me to believe that it would be horrible.  Then I finally went out and bought it to complete my LED library.  Then I put it on fearing the worst and listened to it end to end.  This is just another obvious step in the evolution of the never ending LED ZEPPELIN sound.  People hate it because it is pretty up beat, but that is only because it is different.  Some people hated Led Zeppelin III because it had an acoustic side.  Those who hate this are just ignorant.  They are just trying something knew and I think it really works and is still awesome 26 years after it was recorded.  If you don't have a great time listening to South Bound Suaerez than you have no heart at all.  Naturally after this they would have gone to an even harder sound than before, but that is what true artists do.  Whole Lotta Love is an utter incredible song, but that doesn't mean you should have ten more songs just like it.  That is exactly where the genius of Led Zeppelin lies.  They never played the same song twice.  Some say Tea For One is a copy of Since I've Been Loving You, but they are actually very different.  If you find fault in this album that is because you are looking very hard for something that isn't even there.  The only bad thing about this album is that it was their last one.  RIP John Henry Bonham.
B0009WFFS6|2.0|I'm a Cream fan, but I have not seen any of the reunion concerts. And I don't know if I'd want to even buy this DVD. Based on the song list in the review above, it seems like my favorite Cream songs aren't even on this DVD!  Strange Brew, Tales of Great Ulysees, I Feel Free, Anyone for Tennis, and Swlabr don't seem to be included on this DVD. Surely they played these songs in concert!  What the hell kind of Cream concert or DVD would there be without Strange Brew?????
B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence is Jimmy Page's favorite Led Zeppelin album and it \\"ain't so hard to recognize\\" why.  Each song is a pure rocker, whether it is happy, sad, or epic.  Just like the albums before it Presence shows a picture of the band in the time in which it was written and recorded.  One of the unique abilities of Led Zeppelin was there ability to show what kind of mindset there are in.  Houses of the Holy was very happy yet at times dark.  Led Zeppelin I and II both show a change not only in the band, but in the music scene.  Physical Graffiti shows a plethera of ideas from everybody while Led Zeppelin III shows a softer gentler side.  And of course UNTITLED shows you a little bit of everything.  Presence is one the more intersting sides of Led Zeppelin, their lonely side, especially on Tea For One and For Your Life.  A must have album, no fillers here.
B00005N91B|2.0|After FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT, Michael Douglas has his part down cold.  What is it about this guy that attracts obsessive, psychopathic women?  Moreover, how does he manage to fall for these women and make it so believable?  BASIC INSTINCT is a very sexually-charged thriller.  The plot is relatively simple: we know from the beginning that there is something not right about Catherine, Sharon Stone's character.  The opening of the film finds her as the prime suspect in a brutal killing, an indictment that is made all the more believable by the graphic/nude murder scene in which we see the muderer's naked body.  Let's just say, we've seen that body before.<br /><br />Thus, I spent most of the movie trying to figure out how the whole thing was going to flop on me.  I waited for the twist that would send me down a different path.  Unfortunately, the twists never occurred.  Instead, we get launched a huge assortment of facts and evidence that can be read in several different ways.  It isn't until the final scene that we learn the truth.  I'm not going to give it away, but I think the movie would have been better without the final shot.  If you're going to jerk around with the audience for two hours, you might as well leave them with their thoughts.<br /><br />Overall, BASIC INSTINCT is just an okay thriller.  I did not truly feel the suspense in this film.  What little suspense there is dissolves into erotic passion.  There is plenty of THAT in the film.  Who could forget the famous \\"leg uncrossing scene\\" that forever enshrined Sharon Stone in our memories (and hearts).  But as for suspense, aside from some graphic violence, I wasn't on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />One thing that I did enjoy in this film was watching the transformation of Michael Douglas's character.  Both he and Stone light up the screen and manage to make something out of this average film.  If you enjoy thrillers about femme fatales, then you have to watch this film.  It is a classic of the genre.  But if you're just looking for a good suspense/thriller, I'd shop elsewhere.lassic of the genre.  But if you're just looking for a good suspense/thriller, I'd shop elsewhere.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Every now and again in history someone or something comes along and changes the way things are in some field of culture.  It may be painting, writing, heck it could even be needle point.  In 1968 God smiled upon man and gave us the formation of the greatest rock band of all time, Led Zeppelin.  They not only had the greatest songs you've ever heard, but they changed the face of popular music forever.  This DVD shows exactly how and why Led Zeppelin were and are so important to the music world. <br />Each song on this compilation regardless of the concert it comes from is perfect.  Not really great, but perfect.  Jimmy Page plays with more emotion than Hendrix, Clapton, and King combined.  Robert Plant sings with such range and diversity to make Freddie Mercury look like a joke.  John Paul Jones does things on bass and keyboars that are not humanly possible with out divine intervention.  Then of course there is John Henry Bonham.  If Moby Dick doesn't prove to you that he is undeniably the greatest drummer in history than you are either ignorant or recently had a part of your brain fried by listening to the utter crappyness that is Green Day.  Every song takes you to a different place and time.  The range of the styles on this dvd also proves the genius that is Led Zeppelin.                     I see some of the reviews here on Amazon saying that the songs are all long and boring, and that 50 Cent is such a better artist.  All of those reviews were written by MTV.  Not directly of course, but by MTV's young brain washed soldiers around the ages of 12 and 13.  They've been told that classic rock is old and crappy except for The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix.  They only go back as far as Punk Rock and they think that they are true geniouses.  Rap and Punk kick ass.  People don't take these reviews seriously.  You only need to look at the gramnmatical structure of their sentences to know they are young and ignorant.  It's not their fault either.  SO thanks MTV for dumbing down America one 12 year old at a time.  Led Zeppelin is the definition of music.  Seriously look it up in Webster's, their picture is right there.  Also young kids don't think I'm some old guy in Southern Alabama who is a narrow minded redneck.  I'm not.  I'm 16 and I have a younger brother who is your age.  He's been brainwashed by MTV too.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy that new Kanye West LP.  Go out and by Back in Black or the White Album or something. (Also throw away all of your Blink 182 and Green Day records)  LED ZEPPELIN RULE ALL!!
B00003BDXG|4.0|You know, America is so obsessed with violence these days that it takes a film like NATURAL BORN KILLERS to finally drive things over the edge.  The brutatity and viciousness that is depicted in this film is finally enough to affect us.  But it's not just nameless violence.  What makes this film tick is the fact that we get backstory on so many of our protagonists' victims.<br /><br />Does Oliver Stone reach for the \\"epic\\" statement in this film?  You bet he does.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS plays like a narcotic carnival ride, splicing a montage of images from color, black & white, 35 mm., and more, weaving them into a hypnotic thriller.  The images are pulled from real life, comic strips, and (most importantly) from actual media footage.  For while we follow our killers across the Southwest on their killing spree, the real point of the film seems to depict the country's fascination with their \\"work.\\"  It is our obsession with violence and crime that takes center stage in this film, from the opening \\"sitcom\\" of Juliette Lewis's abusive childhood, all the way to Robert Downy, Jr.'s \\"Hard Copy\\" coverage of the most violent prison riot I've ever seen on camera.<br /><br />Our two main characters do a phenomenal job.  Who would have thought that Woody Harrelson (having come off of WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP & CHEERS) would have it in him.  But he does.  In spades.  Harrelson is positively creepy in this film--a loose cannon that is ready to fire at any second.  His partner, Juliette Lewis, is equally unpredictable.  I couldn't imagine better casting.  It is perfect.<br /><br />In the end, I am not as annoyed by the film's pseudo-analytical statement on the nature of violence and media obsession in this country.  For me, Stone hits the message spot on.  Watch NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  Watch it a second time.  You'll need to in order to catch everything in this film.
1400032717|4.0|The narrator is a mentally challenged kid, no he is not stupid, he just can't understand human emotions.  He could do math, understand science, physics, the Big Bang, the Black hole, everything else except feelings.  There are lot of symbolism in the book.

B000000XB9|5.0|All I can say is, how did i not know these guys??? The songs are all familiar but i didn't know anything about CCR. I stumbled upon the CD and I haven't stopped listening since i found it. CCR has a great way of mixing blues/country with rock and hard rock. The guitar solo in \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\" is just soul-lifting. Some songs are better than others but the best ones are easy to find. I believe that every rock listener should have this and if they like it, get another CD by Creedence Clearwater Revival. I know I will.
0679405496|3.0|One reviewer mentioned that Forster probably never visited India.  This is untrue...as he visited the country at length several times.  His fascination with India started when he was a private tutor to an young Indian man that he fell in love with...his feelings were not reciprocated, however.  He later went on to visit India because of those feelings.  Just FYI.

B000006V31|5.0|As a 40 yr. old African American who listens to everything from classical to neo-soul, Let me say that this rare stoner is one of the better obscure releases that I have ever had the pleasure to absorb. Tripped out rhythm and lyricism, psychedelic arrangements and soul-searing guitar licks make this one a great find for those searching for hard hippie/stoner styled rock.  <br /> <br />Upon listening for the first time, I was blown away by the bands ability. I don't like to make comparisons, But this group reminds me a lot of Led Zepplin (vocals) and Black Sabbath (arrangements and guitar leads). This is very evident on the tracks \\"Stray\\" & \\"Stagnant Pool\\". Instantly, I was reminded of Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\"...Much in the same vein as \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" & \\"War Pigs\\". <br /> <br />Very good piece for its time...Get it, Get stoned and Get educated.

0195067142|5.0|The Pacific Theater of WWII is not glamorized in movies and American children are not taught much about it - and that's for a reason:  The total carnage and brutality of the Pacific Theater seem more like fiction than reality.<br /><br />Sledge makes it a reality, however.  You are drawn in from the first word of the first chapter.  You feel the emotion, smell the smells, you are there, right there with him as he delves into a war that we cannot wish upon any of our service people, ever again.<br /><br />I am truly honored to know WWII Pacific Theater veterans.  When the last is gone, and stories have died with them, this is one of the books that will still be able to tell it like it was.<br /><br />Semper Fi!

I laughed, I cried, I gasped, and I cheered.  It's the first sci-fi movie I've seen in years that actually makes you care about the characters.  So see the movie, buy the Firefly dvd's and see what sci-fi should be.

However, the \\"Special Edition\\" includes several Asian languages in addition to English, but each time you put the DVD in, you have to go to the settings menu and turn off the subtitles if you don't want them to come on automatically.  If you are an English speaker and want the regular North American edition, buy the \\"Limited Issue\\".
B00092ZMDY|5.0|If you are an Eagles fan, and even if you're not, you will absolutely enjoy this DVD. Glen and Don sound better during this concert than they did in the 'ol days. Brought back some good memories! Harmony is fantastic and of course Joe Walsh can play a mean guitar. I love watching his facial expressions while making his guitar talk. A DVD is great because once you watch it you can always play it like a CD for your listening pleasure and it is great to break out for guests who have not seen it before. It's like going to a concert in the comfort of your own home.
B0002OERI0|5.0|If you like Green Day, this album is worth the money.  I won't buy a CD that doesn't have at least three really good songs on it and this one does more than that.  Jesus of Suburbia is an thought-provoking and entertaining commentary on our TV driven culture, and the American Idiot lyrics are more condemning of the mass media and American culture which eats it up than any political party statement.  No reason that Republicans can't like this CD.  The chainsaw guitar riffs and machine gun drums are what I love about the Green Day sound and it's all here.  The lyrics are indeed explicit, even more so if you read them.  As someone who saw Ozzie Osborne and Black Sabbath in concert \\"back in the day\\" and grew up in the heyday of the heavy metal '80s I have to say that a previous reviewer is rather misinformative.  Green Day has matured with the years and apparently our \\"kid reviewers\\" just aren't there yet.
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a great movie, perhaps one of the best I have ever seen. However, having read the book, I notice that some of the most interesting parts of the story have been left out. By taking out these crucial, yet quiet scenes; the movie has a faster pace than the book. <br /> <br />In the movie, Grandpa died suddenly. The only explanation for his death was that he had a stroke. In the book, the preacher, Casy, explained to the family members that the old man could not leave his land, his home and his way of life. Casy explained that Grandpa was spiritually dead when he left his house, and it did not take long for his body to also die. This shows the great sacrifice that the Joads must make in order to survive. In the movie, it just seems that they pack up, leave, and arrive, without any moral dilemmas. Grandpa dies in another family's tent, not just on a blanket by the road. This is important because in the book it symbolizes the way people have to help one another in times of need.  <br /> <br />In the scenes in California, the pace slows down a bit, so I can feel the details of the book surface in the movie. With the events leading up to Casy's death crisp and clear, I could understand his death as brutal murder, and Tom's speech about him carrying on Casy's work beautifully taken from the book. I really loved these scenes, because unlike most of the movie, these scenes do remain true to the book, and because of that, they are full of detail, and you can see the hand of Steinbeck at work. <br /> <br />Despite all of these forgotten scenes, the Grapes of Wrath is one of the best movies of all time.
B000002AH9|3.0|Great vocals; even if she was as worn out as people say.  String section to overpowering in the mix. Even though it was recorded in stereo it sounds better in mono, bringing out her voice.  Worth the few bucks but not every song is a gem.
0451169514|5.0|This is an excellent book. This is King at his best ( well, actually, King at his best was probably The Stand ). It is the story of a \\"clown\\" that brutally murders people.....children specificaly. 7 friends encounter the beast when they are young ( ages around 11-13 )......They supposedly \\"defeat\\" the monster, but 25 years later, it returns. The friends band together one more time in an attempt to stop the horror. This novel is definetly a heavy-weight, coming in at just under 1100 pages, but dont let that deter you. It combines childhood, with horror, and great writing to create an INCREDIBLE book. The reason I urge not to read this is because you will be compelled to read everything else he has written as I have ( It, The Stand, The Shining, Salems Lot, Christine, to name a few of the ones I have read....alll without stopping to read another author ). But, If you end up going on an SK rampage, allow me to warn you......everything else you read by another author  will be rather disappointing.
B00005JLKN|4.0|While none of the Lechter trilogy reaches the masterpiece proportions of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, RED DRAGON is a tense and involving thriller buoyed by the star performances of Anthony Hopkins, Edward Norton, Harvey Keitel, Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  As the movie opens, Norton captures the elusive Hopkins, not without suffering some physical and psychological repercussions.  Keitel convinces Norton to return to the FBI to help snare a monstrous killer who has been dubbed Tooth Fairy by Hoffman's tabloid publication.  This includes Norton's decision to seek the assistance of the equally vile Hopkins.  Moody and atmospheric, RED DRAGON is well paced by director Brett Ratner with an ominous score by the ingenious Danny Elfman, and a twist ending that might leave you squirming a little in your chair.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Everytime Neil Young releases a mellow country rock album, it's immediately hailed as another HARVEST. Well, this is no HARVEST nor another rather overated HARVEST MOON. COMES A TIME might be more applicable, but as far as I'm concerned, any such comparisons are a waste of breath.<br /><br />This is quite simply the most satisfying Neil Young album I've heard in years. Warm, organic & damn haunting. Death & loss are the major themes & you'd have to be deaf not to notice it comes from the gut. All 9/11 & Chris Rock references aside, \\"No Wonder\\" sounds amazingly like vintage 70's Young. His singular warble has never sounded so faltering as it does on, \\"Falling Off The Face Of The Earth\\". The horns on \\"Far From Home\\" lend a sense of humor to what is by and large an introspective album. The goofy Elvis ode, \\"He Was The King\\" seems to be another one tossed in to keep things from getting too serious. For songs like \\"Painter\\" & the title track, the tone is certainly nostalgic but a thick coat of regret keeps things from flying away. In the hands of anyone else the sentiments of \\"This Old Guitar\\" would come off as a Hallmark greeting, but Young's whispered delivery lends it undeniable gravity.<br /><br />I saw Young & choir sing \\"God Made Me\\" on the Katrina Relief concert & it stopped in my tracks. It still does here. Further proof, that if lent an unprejudiced ear, herein lies a moving & poignant album full of subtle melodies that will stick in your head if given a proper listen. Let audiophiles & die hard fans whine & gripe till they're blue in the face.<br /><br />I'm a discerning fan, not everything he's touched turns to gold but Young's albums are always heartfelt. Some just find themselves in your cd player more often than others. PRAIRIE WIND is destined to be one of those.
0307165485|5.0|I've been reading this book to children since my little sister came along in 1971 and it is always a favorite...for both the child and the reader.  With so many different stories and pictures, there's something for every one in every mood.  If you feel like reading, there are stories to read.  If you feel like looking for items to name in pictures, there are little pictures and large pictures to name.  If you feel like making up your own stories to go with pictures, that's in there too.  This is a book no child should grow up without.
B000069AUI|4.0|I've been dusting off some old classics this summer (figuratively, since I get most of my music from the iTunes music store), and so after picking up the newest Coldplay album during the Korea trip, I bought their other two albums when I got back to the States.<br /><br />A Rush of Blood to the Head was released in 2002, and I can still remember listening to it countless times on the way to school. I never got tired of it, though; the tracks are just that durable. Sure, everybody has heard the two singles, \\"Clocks\\" and \\"In My Place.\\" I'm not saying they aren't quality songs, there just a little typical. Some of the other stuff on the album, however, is nothing short of brilliance. \\"The Scientist\\" achieves the same greatness of \\"Yellow,\\" and \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" channels a marvelous Pink Floyd vibe.<br /><br />Unlike the overtly mellow Parachutes, this album is mellow with an agenda; edgy, even. There's a thread of bemoaning lost love that runs throughout the entire affair, as well a track or two focused on war and dying. I don't mind this, somehow, so well is everything put together. When I need to escape into a soundscape of soulful vocals and some masterful guitar-work, I know what to listen to.
B000002UVX|2.0|I don't hate this album. But in comparison to songwriting and perfomances of the 3 albums which he put out with the Jimmy Hendrix Experience, this album just doesn't cut it. If one is to buy their first Hendrix album, buy the first album or Axis: Bold as Love. Then if one likes those albums, proceed to the wonderful Electric Ladyland.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Possibly the best High-School Loser movie ever made, Napoleon Dynamite is a film that you will either love or hate but if you are willing to see through some of the silliness of the plot you will see that this is a movie about connecting with your reality whatever that may be. All of the main characters of this film are highly out of touch with mainstream society and even out of touch with themselves.  In a word they are all loners.  As a wise person once told me \\"friends keep you sane\\" and these people, without friends, are insane.  Living in the past, online, in another culture or just in some other dimension, they all are living lives that aren't checked by the world that goes on around them. This makes conversation, even between each other, disjointed.   Lost, somehow they come together and eventually Napoleon gets a few friends and begins to connect to some sense of reality. Napoleon's moment of revelation comes when he says \\"I dont have any skills. Girls only want to go out with guys who have skills... Ninja Skills, Numchuck skills\\" ... etc. Here his friend Pedro finally connects with him saying he has drawing skills (which he barely has) and Napoleon begins to have some sense of direction. The setting of the movie is somewhat absurd.  It is set in rural/suburban Idaho with all of its dreary depressingly out of date architecture, which lends itself well to the out of touch feeling the film seeks to develop.   Is the movie believable? No.  Is the Movie thoroughly enjoyable? Yes.      So why is this possibly the best high-school movie?  The answer is simple:  everyone feels out of touch to a certain degree in high school.  This movie portrays that vividly and humorously.  It isn't the run-of-the-mill cool people - vs. loser film but a film about individuals against the world.  Seeing the film as something other than a lame joke is key to its enjoyment but is certainly a good film for mixed audiences and anyone who has ever felt out of place... maybe even you.Ted Murena
B00082ZS5W|5.0|I was lucky enough to see Dido in concert at the Chicago Theatre a year ago and it was the best concert I have ever been to.  I have thought since then, she HAS to do a live cd and this is just like reliving the concert.  She's pheonominal.  The live versions of her songs are fantastic...not too off from the originals but just spiced up enough to make you love them as new songs.   <br /> <br />She is a truly gifted artist and this is a must for any Dido fan.  Her commentary during the concert is great as well...she clues everyone into the real meaning of \\"Don't Leave Home\\" (a song about addiction, not love) and gives a real sense of how down to earth she is.  She's also quite funny (During the concert at the Chicago Theatre a man in the second row center was watching her through binoculars to which she replied, \\"Jesus, I'm not meant to be seen that close!\\").  She's an ace, a 12 out of 10.  Can't wait for the next one.
0767903862|5.0|I am a fan of Bill Bryson's, and this book did not dissapoint. With his usual wit, Bryson covers aspects of his visits to areas of Australia as he has taken on the USA and other areas. One begins to appreciate that under the delightful accounts of his travels lies a solid body of research. <br /> <br />My favorite of Bryson's book is \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything.\\" This book is a testement to the fact of the scholarship underlying Bryson's writings. It is easy to lose track of that because his delightful approach.
B00005JNY4|2.0|Let's face it. Anyone who purchases a movie ticket for \\"Into the Blue\\" isn't going to the film in search of an Academy Award winning performance from Jessica Alba or Paul Walker. I'm not convinced that such a thing will ever be witnessed. If you buy a ticket, you are looking for one thing; T & A or P& A, depending on your preference of the two stars. The poster says it all. \\"Blue\\" is an excuse to get two beautiful people into as little clothing as possible for close to two hours. And the film succeeds, almost admirably. God bless director John Stockwell (\\"Blue Crush\\", \\"crazy/ beautiful\\") for all of the shots of Alba and Walker swimming through the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas, letting Alba's barely covered backside or Walker's admirable pecs undulate (yes, undulate!) past the camera.<br /><br />Is there a story? Or just 110 minutes of eye candy? Yes, there is a story.<br /><br />Jared (Walker, \\"The Fast and the Furious\\", \\"Timeline\\") and Sam (Jessica Alba, \\"Sin City\\", \\"Fantastic Four\\") are two beautiful people living in the Bahamas on a broken down boat. Jared just lost his job as a snorkel guide and Sam works at a local tourist stop as an announcer at a dolphin show. One of Jared's buddies, Bryce (Scott Caan) brings his latest girlfriend, Amanda (Ashley Scott) for a vacation from New York. Bryce has the use of an exclusive estate and the boat that comes along with it. This gives Jared the opportunity to explore for the mythical ship wreck, the Zephyr. He believes that a recent hurricane may have disturbed the sand on the ocean floor enough to help find it. Just as they think they have found it, they also find a plane that was downed in the same storm, a plane filled with kilos of cocaine. Jared insists that they leave it alone until they find the necessary proof of the shipwreck, but the greedy visitors from New York have other ideas, threatening everyone's safety.<br /><br />\\"Blue\\" has some of the most beautiful cinematography I have seen in a long time, a significant portion of which is underwater and appears to have been done without special effects. Of course, it doesn't hurt that the film is set in the Bahamas. The island is captured in crystal clear photography and makes a great tourism brochure. A significant amount of the film is underwater and the photography here is also stunning. Every time Alba and Walker swim past the camera... But I digress... Usually, when a film has a lot of underwater action, it is difficult to keep track of what is going on, but \\"Blue\\" is remarkably clear. For the most part, the four central characters are underwater together, making it easy to follow the action.<br /><br />The story is intriguing enough to keep your mind going as well. Jared has specific reasons for wanting to continue the search for the shipwreck as opposed to reporting the plane crash right away. Once the villains do find out, the story becomes a bit more intriguing and it is interesting to watch Jared and Sam work their way through the mess.<br /><br />Unfortunately, any film is going to require Alba and Walker to act. Alba is a better actor than Walker, but not by much. She is able to illicit some sort of emotion during a couple of scenes, no matter how superficial. Walker seems to have three facial expressions; happy, with a grin a mile wide, sexy and serious, which also stands in for his frightened look. He's a guy, so if he is frightened, he is also serious. But when you look as good as Alba and Walker, who cares if you can act. No one expects them to give DeNiro and Streep a run for their money at the next (or any) Academy Awards. You go to see them because you are infatuated with their looks. Period. \\"Blue\\" at least feeds into this infatuation quite well, allowing their groupies to see as much of their bodies as possible in a PG-13 film.<br /><br />The other actors are less successful. Less successful than Alba and Walker? Wow, that's pretty bad. And they don't have the bodies to make up for their lack of acting skill. Josh Brolin plays Bates, Jared's former boss and the owner of a much bigger salvage operation. Brolin is now so typecast that there is simply no surprise anymore. Any time he pops up, you know he will play the jilted former lover or the double crossing backstabber. He needs to branch out and play someone else. James Frain is perhaps the most memorable of the supporting characters. He has a brief, but memorable turn as the owner of all of that submerged cocaine. Tyson, the model, has a brief supporting role as the owner of a packed nightclub.<br /><br />Scott Caan and Ashley Scott play stereotypical New Yorkers. Caan's Bryce is a lawyer who represents people with questionable motives. He works hard and he plays hard and isn't above saying things like \\"We could sell the cocaine and get enough money for your salvage operation\\" or \\"There's enough cocaine down there to buy one hundred boats.\\" He also brings along Amanda (Scott), someone he has known for 14 hours. Yawn! Excuse me a moment while I wipe the sleep out of my eyes.<br /><br />Not that anyone should expect \\"Blue\\" to be a hyper-realistic portrait of anything, but the characters act with an off-putting nonchalance when one member of their group is seriously injured. This attitude almost derails the entire film until you reground yourself and realize `Oh, yeah, I'm watching a comic book\\" A comic book featuring two of the most stunning examples of human flesh anywhere.<br /><br />The ½ star is for the actual film. The other two stars are a thank you gift for all of the shots of Alba and Walker swimming through crystal clear water.<br /><br />But I digress.lack of acting skill.

B000A6T1HC|5.0|I wish I could thank Cecilia Bartoli for the hours of operatic pleasure! This latest album is even better than the glorious Salieri Album. The cover art is very witty as it is Cecilia Bartoli posing in the poster from the Federico Fellini classic movie La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life). This \\"Forbidden\\" Album features operatic works that for a time in the 16th century, during the early days of Baroque Opera, were banned by the Vatican and Roman Catholic Church. Opera was initially considered more than secular. It was downright sinful. Theater was pagan, vulgar, and led people to live an immoral life. But opera was pardoned eventually and composers such as Handel and even Vivaldi were able to compose both religious music (oratorio and Masses) and secular operas. Cecilia Barotli is absolutely imprsesive in these arias. Her voice is showcased like a fine jewel, and her leaps from octave to octave in thrilling coloratura as well as her chest register is all very wondrous. The featured \\"forbidden\\" composers here include Scarlatti, Caldara and the more famous Handel. I love the opening coloratura aria All'Arme as well as the Caldo Sangue, Come Nembo, L'alta Roma (very patriotic) and the more slow and spiritual Lascia La Spinia. Bartoli is at her best in this highly Italian/Baroque album. For serious fans only.

1400031087|4.0|Addiction/recovery books generally fall into two categories: an author glorifying their own experience, or an author who has never had this experience simplifying and demonizing the addiction.  Frey does neither.  Although I am not an alcoholic or drug addict, this is the first book on the subject that has ever rang true for me.  It criticises mainstream depictions of addiction and is, like Requiem for a Dream, one of the best tools to prevent people of any age from abusing dangerous drugs.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Desperate Housewives, the current most hottest show on television, has its first DVD out- Season One. The success of this show is that it evokes America's guilty pleasures with evening soaps like it's 80's predecessor Dallas or for that matter Dynasty. The characters live lives we fantasize about, the drama is gripping, the cast is a hot bunch, and the sex scenes are sizzling. It is a guilty night-time pleasure right before we go to bed. Meet the women of Wisteria Lane- Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Nicollette Sheridan, and Teri Hatcher. Each woman has something to be desperate about. Bree (Marcia Cross) is a nearly-Stepford Wife-Martha Stewart wife whose only concern is keeping up appearances and keeping her reputation. It all falls apart when her husband cheats on her with a dominatrix, she becomes the gossip of the counry club, she arouses the romantic feelings of her local pharmacist and who is able to kill off her husband. Eva Longoria's character Gabrielle is filthy rich and married to a successful and wealthy lawyer, the Hispanic Carlos. But she is bored and indulges in an affair with a 17 yr old gardener (Jesse Metcalfe formerly of NBC's daytime soap Passions). Teri Hatcher's Susan is a girl who falls madly in love with the sexy but mysterious plumber Mike Delfino, who holds dark secrets from his past. It seems everyone has dirty laundry in Wisteria Lane. This DVD is packed with commentary from the actresses and from the Producer/Creator Marc Cherry. All of America will continue to love this show. Let's just hope they don't make the same mistakes as Dynasty and realize that this kind of series has to have a very solid resolution. The best part of this series is that for a soap opera it has modern twists- there is a ton of comedy in here and a touch of the supernatural. The narrator is the voice of the dead Mary Alice, who knows every little detail in the lives of the Desperate Housewives.  <br /> <br />

Every once in a while, someone has to wonder, \\"Why can't everyone just be happy?\\" Well, The Giver shows a world where everyone is. There is no pain, no war, no hunger, and no divorce. Everything is perfect. Or is it? Lois Lowry gives readers a look into a world of the not-so-distant future, where every aspect of life is regulated so that everyone can be happy. Twelve-year-old Jonas discovers the faults in this system all too soon, as he embarks on his journey into adulthood and into the community. He soon discovers the web of lies, ignorance, and shallow feelings that will shape mankind forever... unless he does something about it.
0399152717|3.0|It is like a 007 thriller and can make a good movie. Greed is the underlying motive. Globalization, anti-globalization forces come close and fall apart in this novel. Reading the first half of the book is a bit laborious. A correction: Babar was the the founder of the great Mogul Empire in India.
B0009UC7H0|2.0|Many people compare this to National Treasure, another movie that critics hate because it had a ridiculous story, many potholes and impossible situations but did very well at the box office because it was a good, fun escapist summer movie. <br /> <br />Where National Treasure \\"succeeded\\" was that it had a storyline and action that flowed. I don't think that National Treasure was a great movie, but it certainly was better and more entertaining than Sahara.  <br /> <br />Sahara is more like Charlie's Angel's 2.  It is a collection of action scenes.  It is choppy and there is no flow to the story.  For instance, they are wandering through the sand dunes, chained to a pick up bed.  They find a crashed plane.  Then, boom, the next scene is them wind surfing across across the desert on bits of the plane.  It reminds me of when they cut up a movie to fit into a TV time slot. <br /> <br />This is based on a Clive Cussler book that came out in the early nineties.  I was traveling with an English teacher who was a big Cussler fan.  He was reading this book and complained that it was completely ridiculous.  Over a decade later, the movie makers appeared to be true to the book.
B000002TQV|4.0|While the bends is one of the most overlooked albums to a diehard radiohead fan, it remains one of their best works.  While any fanatic fan will undoubtedly sing the praises of OK Computer or Kid A, the Bends is a great album too.  If you havnt listened to radiohead before, i think that this album is a good place to start.  \\"Just\\" remains one of my favorite songs of all time, and although i myself think that The Bends pales in comparison to works like Kid A and OK Computer, its still a good place to start for Radiohead newbies.  However, if for some crazy reason there is only room in your cd collection for one radiohead album (i couldnt understand why) then i wouldnt choose this one.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|It is interesting to compare the Marley boyz with their father and see how each one amplifies individual aspects of Bob's music.  Ziggy seems to have magnified the spiritual message that his father carried.  Stephen has his father's voice and makes it difficult to tell them apart.  Julian shows the more playful and relaxed nature. Kymani has heartfelt and thoughtful lyrics and sounds a lot like stephen at times. And, finally Damian seems to have captured Bob's great sense of sound which is always fresh and ahead of the mainstream.  He seems the most connected with whats going on with the youths of today.   <br />This album is just as solid as it gets.
B00063EMJ6|1.0|I consider my self a good listener for any kind of music.  <br />I've never heard Neil Youngs songs before this hits collection. When I saw this CD on the shelf I picked it up without a second thought because I have listened to many people talking about how much influential he was back in the seventies. <br />I am sorry Neil Young friends but I am very dissapointed from what I've heard. I mean the guy sounds like a child with a bad voice. His guitar playing is ammateur (I play better than he does) and the melodies are over simplistic.  <br />I know that you will say that  \\"Neil Young power is on his lyrics\\". But I must remind you this: A song is comprised by the music part and the lyric part. I believe that Young tries to hide his poor music abilities behind his over sophisticated lyrics which I don't have the time and patience to \\"decode\\".
B0002SROT0|5.0|When I bought this record at the end of 2004 and slipped it into my CD player for the first time, I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard of Elliott Smith by way of a Web site and had not heard any of his material before. When I purchased this album, I was going out on a limb. What if it turned out to be absolutely horrible and my money was wasted?  <br /> <br />Thank God that it turned out to be exactly the opposite. When I slipped on my headphones and \\"Coast to Coast\\" started playing, I remember feeling a range of emotions. I knew as soon as the vocals came in saying, \\"Last stop for a resolution / end of the line / or is it confusion?\\" that I was on a musical journey I'd never forget.  <br /> <br />\\"Let's Get Lost\\", the second track on the record, is equally as impressive with its sweet harmonies and captivating guitar work that was so characteristic of Elliott. \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\", which follows, has a very catchy melody that is easily stuck in your head (and for good reason). <br /> <br />\\"Don't Go Down\\" features soaring guitars and shows a more edgy side to Smith. The first verse reads almost like a joke: \\"I met a girl snowball in hell/she was as  hard and as cracked as the liberty bell\\" <br /> <br />\\"Strung Out Again\\" is another great rock song. \\"Fond Farewell\\" is, in my opinion, the best song on the album, and the saddest. The lyrics are perfect (albeit sad) and the background vocals only add depth to the lyrics. This is a very powerful song and is very well put together.  <br /> <br />\\"King's Crossing\\" is another highlight which starts off with an interesting array of voices and soon melds into a beautiful piano and harmony. It is by far the most original song on this record in terms of sonicality and definitely shows Elliott's dexterity as a musician.  <br /> <br />\\"Shooting Star\\" is one of the most emotional songs I have ever heard. Elliott sings it with such a sadness that I'd be surprised if it didn't tug on the listener's heartstrings. It has a beautiful sadness about it that can't be disturbed. I also like the crickets that are really low in the mix.  <br /> <br />The record continues with \\"Passing Feeling\\", another great rock song with great lyrics and guitar work. \\"Last Hour\\" is a very sweet sounding song, despite its sad lyrics. The finger-picking is beautiful and the melody is entrancing.  <br /> <br />\\"Shooting Star\\" is by far the most guitar-heavy song on the record and really, really shows Elliott's skill. He might not have done guitar solos very often, but when he did, you could expect them to be well-written. This song is a perfect example of that. \\"Memory Lane\\" shows Elliott's lighter side, or so it seems. I've heard many people say that this is a \\"happy, cute\\" song. I happen to think otherwise. If you look under the melody, this song reeks of hospitalization and memories one does not want to remember. This song seems to be Elliott's coming to terms with himself, his past, and his future.  <br /> <br />\\"Little One\\" is a great song and is very inventive. I love how the two vocal parts sing different lyrics on certain parts. I think this should've been the last track on the record. \\"A Distorted Reality...\\" has a great intro and lyrics. However, I do not think it is a good closer for the record.  <br /> <br />All in all, I think this could have been Elliott Smith's greatest record, his White Album. I think, with the help of family and friends, we got his Abbey Road. There are many people out there who are probably saying, \\"God, I wonder what this would've been like if he'd completed it\\", and we will never know. But this is a great effort none the less and will definitely be one of my favorite albums for a long time to come. This is the record that got me hooked on Elliott Smith, and while it falls short compared to his other albums (because he was not alive to complete it), I think it's not far behind in the race.  <br /> <br />Please, give this record a chance. You won't regret it.  <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

However, this book really keeps it interesting for the most part and still drives home the design points particularly around EAI. I think it would make a great book for someone wanting to get into design patterns, which is important for anyone writing integration applications. Also, it is a good all-around reference book for the serious and seasoned Java programmer who needs to know how to design integration. I have GoF, and I refer to this book more often from a practical standpoint.

B00005JO0J|4.0|I confess, I never watched the TV show, Firefly.  I like Joss Whedon and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but I just never got around to it, and then it got cancelled.  Thus, I do not know what information in Serenity is new to the movie, and what is already-established lore from the show.  Judged on its own merits, Serenity is a pretty-good film.  Some of the reviews I've read claim that it is better than Star Wars.  This is drastically overstating things - especially since the \\"hero\\" bears more than a passing resemblance to Han Solo.  This movie has more in common with Star Trek - also based on a TV series.  It isn't as much concerned with creating a new mythology, the way Star Wars is - it's about the continuing adventures of a crew of a pirate ship.  As such, I felt slightly anti-climaxed by the movie; it wasn't an earth-shattering experience - it was just a good, exciting story with good characters, exciting fight scenes, and snappy dialogue
B0002EXH5O|2.0|Being a big fan of Megadeth since Dave Mustaine ventured out on his own with his first outing \\"Killing's My Business...\\" and his rendition of his former band Metallica's \\"The Four Horsemen\\" renamed and lyrically changed to \\"Mechanix\\", I really wanted to like this album.  \\"Peace Sells...\\" still holds a special place in my catalogue and is still my favourite.  Album after album came, some better than others, with \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" probably being the very best to date.  Through the years I always thought of \\"Rust In Peace\\" as one of the weaker, \\"well it happens to every great band\\" albums.  But then I started to realise, that I may have actually misjudged the album... other critics and fans noted that this was Megadeth's best album and their defining album--maybe I was wrong, maybe it really was their best effort, and I had missed something.  I went back to my CD collection, blew off the dust and gave it another listen... and then another.  I definitely was missing something.  The vocals aren't nearly as good, the hooks not as memorable, and the lyrics not as creative.  This really wasn't their best album.  I feel a sort of relief with the knowledge that I hadn't misjudged the album; but also a pang of sorrow that I actually wasn't hearing something that thousands of other Megadeth enthusiasts were loving!  In the end, I suppose it's all very subjective.  And I will have to content myself with listening to \\"My Last Words\\" on repeat and revelling in the genius that I believe to be \\"Countdown to Extinction\\".  Who knows, maybe another ten years will go by and I will find a new appreciation for \\"Rust In Peace\\"... or maybe not.  But there are millions of fans who like a lot of other music that I don't appreciate either, so I'll simply have to move on and accept the fact that, yes, it's only me.
B00005YXZH|5.0|With almost six hundred mostly starry-eyed reviews already posted about this album, I probably don't have much new to say on the subject.<br /><br />But I'm going to anyway.<br /><br />Every once in a while a band comes along that's just...better...than the large majority of other bands out there.  They do things their own way, and all they care about is making great music.<br /><br />Wilco is one such band.<br /><br />And then, every once while, these great bands might put out an album that's even better than anything you ever thought that even they were capable of.<br /><br />And \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is just such an album.<br /><br />All I can say is, believe the hype.  Believe it.  Jeff Tweedy, Wilco's frontman, will one day be looked on as someone every bit as talented and visionary as John Lennon, Wilco's role in music history will be discussed in the same breaths as The Beatles, and \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" will be on every music reviewer's Top 100 list.<br /><br />Oh, it's fancy!<br /><br />Listen to it once, and you'll like it.  Listen to it twice, and you'll like it more.  Listen to it a hundred times, a thousand times, and you'll hear something new it with every listen.<br /><br />Fans of the Velvet Underground, of Wilco's earlier stuff, of Jim O'Rourke, of funk and alt.country and indie rock and good old rock and roll all need to own and know this album.<br /><br />Buy it, and I promise you, you'll thank me.
B000AMPZGC|2.0|The soundtrack to The Corpse Bride, left me melancholy, because i had high hopes for the film, and the music. I am not going to get into the film at this juncture. The music was formulaic for Elfman, and i dont understand how you could go from Nightmare before christmas...a great jumping off point and 12 years later not go one up on this film? The songs were boring, the lyrics were water thin, and the melodies were nothing new. I understand that Elfman has his own sound, I have loved him since Oingo Boingo, I adore his movie scores, but this one didnt make the grade with me. The only song i can say was \\"okay\\" was the one where elfman actually sings and tells the story of the corpse bride to Victor, and even that left me wanting more.When I left the theater after seeing Nightmare before christmas, I couldnt get the songs out of my head I think i hummed \\"making christmas\\" for about 4 years, After getting into my car 5 minutes after this movie ended, i couldnt hum you a single melody.....
B000002NJS|4.0|I dusted this album off recently in 2005 and enjoyed it thoroughly. I'm not even a bona-fide Madonna fan but this hits the spot as one of her most polished efforts.  Still sounds pristine after all these years. Put Madonna's past images behind and let the music work its production magic.  Recommended.
0802130208|4.0|If a more repulsive protagonist than Ignatius J. Reilly can be found anywhere in literature, I've yet to encounter him.  Conjure up an image of an older, more twisted Holden Caulfield, unemployed and living with his mother after depleting all of her income on bankrolling his over-education, bloated to gargantuan proportions from inactivity and the consumption of enormous quantities of weenies, and you begin to get the picture.  Whether or not your particular tastes will rate this as one of the funniest books ever written, as claimed by some reviewers, it is certainly one of the most creative and disturbing.  When I wasn't laughing at Ignatius's outrageous antics, I was overwhelmed by the sheer force of his self-destructive behavior.  Surrounded by a cadre of pathetic characters whom society would regard as more-or-less \\"normal,\\" I pulled hard for the undeniably-brilliant Ignatius to expose them as the \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" promised by the title and reveal his true genius to the world.  But time after time, he ended up disappointing me with his serial-lying and delusional views.  While the ending tantalized me with the hope that Ignatius had reformed his ways, I closed the book with the sinking feeling that his downward spiral was bound to continue, a feeling reinforced by my awareness of the author's own suicide at age thirty-two.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\"
B000002LCX|5.0|I can't say that this is The Smiths' best album--I can't, because, they have a lot of GREAT albums--but I can say it's my favorite.<br /><br />\\"The Queen is Dead\\" is terrific, but this feels more anthemic, more forceful, alive, and vital.<br /><br />\\"Louder than Bombs\\" is amazing--though many don't even consider it an album, just a compilation--but this feels more focused, directed, and much tighter.<br /><br />\\"The Smiths,\\" their first album is experimental and fun and jubilant and dark, but this is the work of a mature band that's seen too much and that, although they're bummed out about things, can't take it all too seriously anymore.<br /><br />\\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\" is an amazing collection of songs.  From lyrics like, \\"And the pain was enough to make a shy, bald, buddhist reflect and plan a mass murder,\\" to a conflicted love song to a girlfriend in a coma, to an amazing, self-referential song about the record industry, lyrically Morrissey had never been better.<br /><br />And musically, the songs are driving, haunting, deep...and even catchy.  It's almost wrong to call this \\"Eighties music,\\" because it has almost nothing in common with the Thomas Dolbys and the Duran Durans that once cluttered up the airwaves.  This was music written ahead of its time, and music that's good anytime: depressing, enlivening, uplifting, thought provoking.<br /><br />These songs got me through adolescense, and then they just stuck around.  I don't think they'll ever leave me, and at this point, I don't want them to.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Although I liked their first album, it sounded quite clear they'd come to the song-writing table with distinctly different ideas. Out of Exile sounds better than their previous effort because they're starting to sound more \\"together\\". Occasionally they seem to take an incredibly obvious commercial route, which can grate given three-quarters of the bands' resolute stand on that, but it still makes for some damn good stuff. Chris Cornell's voice remains to-die-for but his riddles are becoming harder to fathom. Tom Morello lets loose with some speedy solos reminiscent of those found on RATM's first album - which I was beginning to think were locked up forevermore in one of his crazy effects pedals! But Morello fans, don't despair - he can still make his guitar sound like an electric elephant's fart. Which is sweeeeeeet. <br /> <br />Stand out songs on this album are \\"Out of Exile\\", \\"Drown Me Slowly\\", and \\"Man or Animal\\" - all undeniable rockers. But the best has to be \\"Dandelion\\". It's unlike anything they've done before with an upbeat feel without being cheesy. (It also possesses a middle-eight thing that could have been sampled from Led Zeppelin!!) Someone said that, although as independent musicians they may have seen better days, Audioslave look like they're on the up; and I couldn't agree more. Also, if you do buy it you get a hilarious photo of Tom Morello posing \\"mid solo\\" on the inside cover, eclipsing the overlookable acoustic bonus track, \\"Like a Stone\\".
B00006AVRK|5.0|I have been enjoying \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" for the past 8 years on the advice of a friend, who knew I enjoy British situation comedies and dramas.  \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" based on the novels of the famous British/American author P.G. Woodhouse, is both comedy and drama.  There are serious elements, but the comic is always at the front, in a very refined, subtle way.  This whole series operates on the basic story of a wealthy young man in the late 1920s, Bertram (Bertie) Wooster, played by Hugh Laurie, who has as his butler/valet/chauffer/cook Jeeves, played by Stephen Fry.  Wooster is frequently involved in marital and business entanglements which he finds impossible to got out of, without the help of Jeeves, his brilliant, behind the scenes butler.  Jeeves often manages to play one party against another:individuals who are antagonists to Wooster in the story - to solve a given situation, or crisis. <br /> <br />I bought these on VHS in 1997 and 1998, after seeing 3 episodes from the 1991 season (the 2nd season) on PBS.  I was so impressed not only with the acting, but also the scenery, sets, and the beautiful, huge stately houses they were filmed in, I was immediately hooked.  I wish I could have foreseen the advent of DVD, and would have waited;  buying these on VHS, I spent about 3 times - for 21 different VHS tapes - the price this Megaset sells for today. <br /> <br />The supporting actors and characters are also excellent, which vary from episode to episode.  The chemistry between them shows a real glimpse into life of the English upper middle and upper classes in the 1920s, and how out of touch with reality they appear to us in the first decade of the 2000s.  There are always 3 plots going on in each episode which shift back and forth, and all are resolved at the end of each 50 minute episode. <br /> <br />I cannot say enough good about this series, and it's very high quality.  Also, the lack of sexual themes, extreme violence, and foul language makes it a goodseries for family entertainment, although some children and teens may miss the subtle humor of Wooster's and Jeeves' lines.  But I recommend it wholeheartedly.
B0000CFW87|3.0|Wasn't thrilled with the CD as a whole.  There are 2 songs on there that are wonderful.
B0000019PA|5.0|You know that kind of empty feeling you get sometimes, when you're alone?  As if there's something missing from your life, but you just don't know what?<br /><br />Well, there is something missing.<br /><br />And this is it.<br /><br />And you need it to be complete, I can tell.<br /><br />This album is mind-blowingly original.  I get chills just thinking about it.  It's amazing.  Neutral Milk Hotel is a big band with an even bigger sound.  Explosive drums that rattle windows and sensibilities.  Theremin.  Horns!  Great bass lines, rockin' guitar, mind-warping (great) lyrics, assorted weirdness, and some of the best, most original vocals the music world has ever known.<br /><br />This album is an experience.  It may take you a while to get used to the vocals which are high and screechy and unlike anything you've ever heard, but which slam you with the full impact of exactly what the singer's trying to say.  Sometimes the music is nothing but a voice and an acoustic guitar, yet the vocals are so full and so...much...that you might not even notice until several listens later.<br /><br />Many of the album's lyrics deal with the Holocaust and World War II and the lives and reincarnations and afterlives of many of that era's victims, and so the album, in a way, feels a bit like a cryptic story, like a concept album, though I hear it was never intended to be one.<br /><br />This is an album by a thinking band, by a rocking band, by a band too original and too intense for the watered down world of modern day pop radio.  Buy it, rock out to it, listen to it.  Immerse yourself in the crashing rain of percussion of \\"Holland 1945,\\" the ghostly theremin cloud that rises through and hovers above \\"Ghost,\\" and the full lyrical impact of a song that explores \\"how strange it is to be anything at alllll!\\"<br /><br />They told you beer was an acquired taste, and you choked it down until you liked it.  Well, this may be an acquired taste as well, but it's even better than beer.<br /><br />Their first album is great as well, as in anything by Neutral Milk Hotel percussionist Jeremy Barnes's other band, \\"A Hawk and a Hacksaw.\\"s in anything by Neutral Milk Hotel percussionist Jeremy Barnes's other band, \\"A Hawk and a Hacksaw.\\"
B00004Z459|4.0|Right, lets try and review this album on its musical merits rather than bringing up any Linkin Park image problems and theories that they are in fact the alter ego band of Backstreet Boys that so many people imply... Firstly, this is a very accomplished rock album indeed. (I try to refrain from that shady term \\"Nu-metal\\".) Hybrid Theory is an impeccably well-recorded album that benefits from a well worked out dual-vocal assault. This in itself is nothing new (311, Mushroomhead and countless others), but the agro-tinged rapping of Mike Shinoda works exceptionally well with the versatile, melody-driven voice of Chester Bennington. In fact, Bennington probably possesses the most significant voice for yelling AND singing since Mike Patton (though Patton himself would probably prefer to shy away from any Linkin Park comparisons. Also, Bennington can't hold the tune so well live). Each song is good and different enough from the rest to maintain interest. All songs draw on the super-tight musicianship of the band (it's a pretty uncomplicated stuff so it SHOULD be tight) and we even have a DJ/sample extravaganza in the form of \\"Cure for the Itch\\" (being the album's penultimate song it's probably a little overdue but never mind). All in all, this is a very good rock album. Contrary to popular online reviewer theory, it is NOT the best album ever, but, however, it is way above average-standard for this type of affair. Those who disagree with the latter are either haters of rock or feel they may become disembowelled for liking a \\"put together band\\". My only criticism... too polished an act? Make your own mind up. Four stars.  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I just watched \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", last night.  This is the film that has had citizens of the United States, France and other nations debating, discussing and deliberating.  While some see it as a true example of freedom of speech, and following the old addage that \\"the truth shall set you free,\\" others see it as a perpetuation of subversion, disrespect and even anti-patriotism, at the hands of the filmmaker and writer, Michael Moore.<br /><br />This is the first of Moore's documentaries that I have seen, and I hope to see more.  His unique blend of ironic narration, juxtaposed with presidential footage, a supercharged soundtrack (interlaced with a combination of rock & roll and standards), and chilling figures and documents, backing up his belief that the whole \\"War on Terror\\" was one of the hugest,deadliest, coldest and most expensive tricks pulled on the American people, to date.  According to Moore, not only was the 9/11 tragedy a set-up, from the get-go, but due to the political and professional ties the Bush family had with the Bin Laden family, our soldiers were sent to start a war with a group of innocent people, in a country that had nothing to do with the terrorism, or the deaths of thousands of innocent casualties in the Twin Towers, that fateful day of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />This film is enough to make anyone opposed to this war very, very angry at our government, the grand manipulators who played with our heads (through media coverage, as an example), and even at ourselves for falling for this cruel joke, devised by politicians who only bow to the almighty dollar.  Moore captures the tone of this anger very effectively, yet, I didn't find it one-sided, subversive or even particularly radical.  I just felt I was being presented with the facts that were coveted for so long, and that I was finally given a glimpse into a reality (more like \\"surreality\\") that many of us may have suspected, but few of us were able to prove.  I felt that Moore's interviews with people in support of the war were not manipulations.  He listened respectfully to Lila Lipscomb, mother of one of the soldiers, with respect and also with tolerance.  What's more, he doesn't let us forget that the young people fighting on the frontlines are just as human, real and have just as much dignity as those who are vehemently opposed to the bloodshed and heartlessness of violence.<br /><br />Masterfully done, Michael.  This is definitely one of those films that will stand the test of time.  It is truly a time capsule that transcends the generations.  I am sure people will talk about \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" for many, many years to come.in support of the war were not manipulations.

076113719X|5.0|This calendar is great. I love the illustrations and it's very functional. I love how I can write birthdays in on the day's title box and free up space in the activity boxes. It's great to see who's doing what with whom and actually have the space to write everything in.
B000001DYA|5.0|Jesus christ, this album is heavy. I wish I had been old enough to check these guys out back in '67 '68. I can only imagine the impact Blue Cheer had on audiences with their dirty RAW grungy thick wall of guitar and thundering bass. Not to mention the brain bashing highly percussive drumming style.<br /><br />Blue Cheer were WAY WAY, did I say WAY? ahead of their time. To say this album withstands the test of time would be an extreme understatement. This music is heavy plain and simple. Sure you can hear the obvious 60's blues, psychedelic influences from the era. But Blue Cheer created music that you could head bang to like any Metal band from the 80s. I can listen to Vincebus Eruptum sandwiched between Slayer, Judas Priest or Black Sabbath any day. if you like Heavy rock/Metal music, YOU NEED this album now!!
1400034779|5.0|How appropriate that Precious is the name of our heroine in this charming tale of an African queen who displays a wonderful sense of humanity in solving problems.  Set in Botswana, the story opens with background on the life of our heroine leading up to how she became a private detective.  The book is filled with humerous short stories in each chapter, usually involving the solution to a brief mystery in which our detective uses clever skills.  The scenery is richly described, and makes the stories endear to the heart.  And there is some love linked into the overall story, which I am sure any reader will enjoy.  I wish I could give this a 6th star!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Frank Miller's immensely popular noir comic books come to the screen with the perfection of a skilled film-maker, a man that has made some wonderful films...and a not-so-good 3D film, Spy Kids. Sin City is the epitome of comic-noir, the psychedelic dream of pulp books and films. I have never read a comic so damn entertaining and grounded. And now I've never seen a comic-to-film adaptation so damn close to its source material.  <br /> <br />If you've never read a comic by Frank Miller, it won't matter when seeing Sin City. The tone is always dark and brooding, with a light comic touch, narrated in such a way as to mimic the style of a 50's crime novel. \\"She smelled the way angels ought to smell,\\" says Marv, a hulking brute, down on life, the center of one of the three stories in the film. A beautiful woman lies next to him on the bed, naked as the day she was born, and gleaming in full color while all around her is laced in black and white. She's dead. And Marv wants to know how and why. A whole world of corruption falls into his lap, pointing the finger at him, framing him, making him the fall guy. But Marv will get the truth out of somebody, and that somebody will have hell to pay.  <br /> <br />Another of the tales centers around a retiring cop in pursuit of a pedophile, one that gets off on hearing little girls scream as he tortures them and rapes them. But this pedophile is the son of a powerful and corrupt senator. Crap hits the fan, needless to say.  <br /> <br />The third tale is about hookers running a certain part of Sin City. The cops look the other way while they run the streets. One day all this comes crashing down when a sleazy cop is murdered by Miho, one of the many hookers running the area - she kicks butt like no other in this film, like something out of Tarantino's Kill Bill. Everything begins to fall apart, and it ends in a graphic bloodbath.  <br /> <br />Sin City is nearly identical to the comics word for word, shot for shot. Try reading one ofthe comics and then watch the film, you'll be amazed at the intricacy. The look of the film is all black and white, exactly as you would see them in the books. Hints of color pop out at you from time to time; blood is always red, eyes of a few beautiful ladies are blue or green, Blondie's hair is shiny gold. It is truly a masterpiece of design. Robert Rodriguez directs this film as if using Frank Miller's comics as storyboards, where all the shots were set up as many as fifteen years ago. The all star cast takes up the characters as if they were tailor-made for them when the stories were written. Anyone else not so gifted an actor could have put this film in the grave long before its release. Each actor's ability on screen shines forth with ferocity and dedication.  <br /> <br />Every shot, every scene, every nuance of Sin City is like a painted picture, one that can be free of its bonds on paper and flow with grace, creating a perfect whole of film noir and comic violence.
0385338686|5.0|I liked the Shopaholics, I really enjoyed \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" but \\"Undomestic Goddess\\" is by far my favorite Kinsella. I'm so thrilled to see that, unlike many successful authors, Kinsella isn't sitting back and resting on her laurels; every book is that much better than the last one.<br /><br />This was such a wonderful story, a joy from beginning to end. Samantha Sweeting is a very genuine, clever, deep character, as is every other character in this novel. From the country-rich Trish and Eddie to the wise and wonderful Iris, every character in this novel is richly drawn and a joy to behold - even the bad guys. Gardener love-interest Nathaniel is absolutely adorable, and the love story is wonderfully developed and tightly told. Just wonderful. A definite keeper novel.<br /><br />Even if you weren't a fan of the Shopaholics, I heartily recommend you give Kinsella another chance on this one. Can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
0596000480|1.0|This book was required for my CSC 301 \\"Distributed Software Systems\\" course in college.  I would get alot of programming assignments and try to use the book as a reference to learn the syntax of the language, but, there are virtually no examples to look at and learn from.  Maybe when I'm at a more advanced level with JavaScript, I'll appreciate it more, however, right now I'm giving it two thumbs way down. <br />If you are a beginner to JavaScript, this book is not for you.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|This is acoustic like I haven't heard Neil,or anyone,do before. Neil dug deep for this one--the lyrics are lyrical,the singing heartfelt(even where it's Shakey) and he gets real weight out of his acoustic guitar with some of the finest rythmn playing I've ever heard,from anyone. It reminds me of Jimi's rythmn playing on \\"All Along the Watchtower\\". Say what you will,for me this cuts everything he's done acoustically,overall, except Harvest and in some ways(maturity and heart) it's beyond them all. Even the horns work, which surprises me as much as anyone, and the strings are great!!! Everything fits tightly into the whole to create a truely powerful experience. I'm VERY surprised, but Neil Young has pulled it off. Taken together,this is the best Neil Young record since----\\"Rust Never Sleeps\\"?,\\"Sleeps with Angels\\"?-----in the end though, in the unique way Neil has of crafting individual and unique works, it has no peers.
B000001GQP|4.0|Sorry to spoil all the rave reviews written. Indeed this is a classic recording, but that does not mean it is ideal or the best. In fact I listened to samples of Muti and seems almost perfect. Grammophone reviewed this classic and recommended it but said Muti was better and more expensive. Later, when Jochum appeared in \\"The Originals\\" Grammophone changed its mind. Not mine. Muti seems more explosive and incisive and has greater depth in quieter sections. The famous tenor solo \\"Roasted swan\\" it seems too ridiculous to my ears. It surely was intended to be funny but here the singer took it to the extremes. And the bassoon which introduces the piece seems here too fast (again, Muti is slower and more perceptive). As I said \\"Amor volat undique\\" \\"In trutina\\" and \\"stetit puella\\"  are a bit too fast. Not that it is wrong here, just much better if you for God's sake slower for one time speeds and let yourself savour the atmosphere, dear Jochum. And Dulcissime ... listen to Auger (again Muti ...) and well, that tiny vibrato of Janowitz in her high notes ... well, quite annoying on repeated listening. And her Dulcissime is taken so fast that seems nonsense.  <br />Great chorus and orchestra, great sound, great speeds (excepted what I highlited). Ahh I forgot... Baritone FD was miscast. WHAAATTTT???? How Dare I to say so??? One of his great recordings!!!! Well, yes. Great a lieder singer as he is, varied his singing as his is here, his voice does not suits this piece. His voice colour is too lyrical, too light. Of course he knows that and does what he can (and he achieves) in dramatic sections like Abbas and Statuens but listen to eg Blomstedt and find out what a truly dark baritone is. Please let me explain: here we have a wonderfull miscast interpretation.  <br />A classic? Yes. Ideal? Of course not!! There is room to improve still, I think. Did Muti achieved this? I dont know. But ... you will say it was approved by Orff.  <br />Yes but that does not mean this recording tobe perfect, just good. Did he listened to the competence? Did he know about Plasson, Dutoit, Thielemann, Runnicles ... Orff was dead when this recordings were made. There are always room for improvements in the future so a composer's \\"OK\\" made in a popular work years ago should not be the only valid recommendation to purchase it. Sorry, Amazon reviewer, I disagree. A classic, but not perfect.
B00020HEL6|5.0|If you like Josh Grobin or Michael Baube you'll like Michelle.  I listen to these smooth vocals over and over again.  The sounds of smooth jazz are great!  I look forward to more of her work.
0060977493|5.0|I loved this book.  Sorry to say that my husband threw it at the wall and never finished it.  That's the way it is with magical realism and loose story spinning.  But if you just float with it, accept the imagery and the magic, you will be rewarded with a poignant sensitive tale of a family gone asunder, and how easily emotions, fate and circumstance lead to tragedy.  Not for everyone, but you will probably know right away.  A sweet sad book, and much better than lots of other highly touted novels out there, not to mention any names!! PS If you like this novel, read House of the Spirits by Allende.

Wonderfull interpretations. Full of passion, energy, and that \\"autumnal fragance\\" so typical of Brahms. They don't seem bland at any moment. Concerning the sound, it is truly great, not a problem. Main melodic lines inside orchestra are well audible.  <br />To sum up one of the best symphonic cycles, and the best at this price.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|What a terrible movie,Reeves is just horrible and boring in this role.Maybe a spectacle for the kids but I think this film would put most inteligent adults to sleep or just prompt them to hit the eject button.Watching this really is like a trip into hell !!
0783227434|3.0|If your not 15 and obsessed with b horror, 'army of darkness' is nowhere near the quality of Evil Dead 2, yes Evil Dead is a classic, just not a very 'good' movie, per se. Army of Darkness tries desperately to recapture the magic of 2, it's kind of like the Matrix sequels. The first made you think, and as soon as i heard they were making sequels, I had to roll my eyes, and my predictions came true. Utter garbage to the first one. I don't think the disparity between 2 and AOD is as large as the matrix sequels, but it is similar. It just stinks of the usual, milking the fanboys ala 'lucas style' <br /> <br />Thank God their not re-remaking 2.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|I bought this 2 disc compilation last night and have already listened to the whole thing, and I'm about to listen to it all over again. Every song has a different feel to it and like always the lyrics are adventerous and touching at times. Songs like All Night,Sad,Down,Hitchhicker,Alone,Footsteps,Education,U, Yellow Ledbetter,Fatal,Otherside and a few more just draw you in. I only had to skip maybe three or four songs cause I just did'nt dig them. I'll put it this way why spend a ton of money tracking down the earlier singles to get these tracks cause you get all of them here in a two CD compilation in a great package. The artwork is intresting something I've never seen before and that makes it pretty unique. Everytime I purchase a PJ release it never fails to let me down and it won't let you down. The only complaint I have is PJ's '92 Unplugged performance hasn't been released in any from yet and really it should they did a great job that day. <br /> <br />Sorry this is so long, so I'll wrap this one up. If your a causual fan and want to hear some rare songs then go for it get this album. If your'e a new fan to PJ I recommend getting Rearview Mirror Greatist Hits, Ten and then purchase this this. Do what you want really you'll never go wrong with a PJ CD.
0440237688|4.0|A great book that really pulls you into it. The plot is great and develops smoothly. The characters are well developed and the book itself is written greatly. This book is recommended reading for anyone who likes this style, and some who might not. When i first started reading it i really didnt want to but then it just pulled me in.
0307276902|5.0|From the first page I could not put this book down. I am drawn to stories that are real, honest and about how people survive extreme situations. This is definitely an extreme life situation. I sort of relate to James in how he does not believe in AA or the twelve Steps and how it is OUR OWN CHOICE to not kill ourselves with drugs and alcohol. I think this book is a must for anyone to understand addiction and to be very grateful if we do not have extreme addictions like James in our own lives.
6305949980|5.0|Jack the pumpkin head is the star of this show. I liked the song \\"What's This,\\" as Jack, the curator of Halloween puzzles over his discovery of Christmas. He toys, and examines all of the physical trappings that emerge during the season, but cannot figure out the heart behind it. With some peer pressure, he makes Christmas his own without satisfying himself with what he really wanted to discover about Christmas, before actually taking on the task.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Great, solid blues cd.  Near perfect tone from Mr. Guy, with songs that are rife with emotion, and weigh heavily on the listeners conscience.  I like the guest work, Santana is right on and the John Mayer duet is powerful stuff.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Forget about all the previous Batman films. \\"Batman Begins\\" blows every single one of them out of the water.  No Contest.  Christian Bale is Batman/Bruce Wayne.  This is the first film of the series where the hero is the focus resulting in a much more compelling and more focused storyline.    This isn't \\"The Joker\\" co-starring Batman, ala the 1989 film and the strongest of the previous incarnations.  The problem  with that film was that Jack Nicholson was just too over the top as the Joker (if that's possible). It seemed for the audience that it was all about \\"hey , look at  the chances Jack is taking in this role\\" rather than getting lost in the character.  Jack's hammy acting seemed to place the story in a secondary role.    Not the case here.  There were two themes present in this movie: 1) Fear and 2)Relationships.    When we meet Bruce early in the film, we see he originally has a fear of bats after a very harrowing(and fateful) incident. We then see Bruce's attempts to conquer his fear after the tragic and very brutal murder of his parents, by throwing himself into the heart of the criminal element. This eventually leads Bruce to a \\"Monastery\\" where he meets Ra's Al Ghul and comes under the tutelidge of the enigmatic Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) who teaches Bruce how to use fear as an effective weapon.  This weapon, the most important in The Batman's arsenal, is used skillfully in this film, showing us, from the perspective of the criminals, what it's like to be hunted by The Batman. Fear is also the weapon of the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) used to chilling and sometimes disturbing results.  Finally, The Batman must overcome fear to defeat the Scarecrow and \\"Ra's Al Ghul.\\"    \\"Batman Begins\\" has more emphasis on strong relationships than any of its recent contemporaries.  The strength of young Bruce's relationship with his parents, especially his father, manages to make their inevitable deaths all the more horrifying.  Equally important is the mentor/student relationship of Henri Ducard and Bruce. Ducard becomes a father figure to the young man which figures prominently in the film's climactic battle.  Thomas Wayne instills in his son moral strength and the courage to stand against evil. Henri Ducard instills in Bruce unwavering focus and, when needed, ruthlessness.    I especially loved the relationships between Bruce and the supporting cast:   Bruce and Alfred - Hearfelt, touching and believable. Michael Caine is the best Alfred. Period.    Batman and Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) - Loved the intial mistrust, turning into mutual respect. Lt. Gordon is one good cop in a sea of corruption in the Gotham Police Force.  Batman needs Gordon and Gordon needs Batman, a truism only alluded to in Tim Burton's initial outing.    Bruce and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) - Addresses the question of how and where Batman gets his gadgets (especially the very cool Batmobile).  Loyalty and trust are very important in this relationship. As mentioned in a previous review, Fox is like James Bond's \\"Q\\".     As for Katie Holmes, she's not as weak as many reviewers have reported. Her role as a tough attorney who grew up with Bruce worked for me. She was certainly the most resourceful and down- to- earth of the all the series' love interests.     Great action sequences, excellent acting and a compelling back-to- basics story make this the ultimate Batman film.
B000002H2H|5.0|Given the fact that it only runs for 47 minutes, this album still manages to cram enough memorable songs in it. You also begin to hear the voice of James Hetfield change to what it is today, more mature, as oppose to the awkward, screaming, teenager-esque voice in \\"Kill 'Em All.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Fade To Black\\" is a great melodic song, coupled with faster, more harder, songs like \\"Trapped Under Ice,\\" \\"Ride The Lightning,\\" and \\"Fight Fire With Fire.\\" \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" starts off good, but after a while (it's 8:53 long) it tends to get kinda old and you eventually forget what you're listening to. But it's still a great album. <br /> <br />Metallica forever!
B000021XS0|1.0|Well I was pretty harsh on Dream Theater's \\"Images and Words\\", to say the least. Not being one to never give a band a second chance, I decided to take a good, long look at \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory\\" in the hope that I might find something I enjoyed. <br /> <br />Heh. Yeah right. <br /> <br />Now I'm sure many a prog fan will look at my rating and, like all narrow-minded fans do when their sacred cows come under attack, presumptuously assume I'm too stupid to \\"understand\\" Dream Theater or something. I take a lot of shots at bands I dislike, for sure, but I'm truly beginning to deeply loathe Dream Theater. To me, they represent all that is wrong with Progressive Rock in general. Hyperbole, you say? Let me explain... <br /> <br />\\"Images and Words\\" may have been self-indulgent, but \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" is just off the deep end. The album starts off well, but by the fourth track, the band just completely abandons all sense of restraint. Many songs have three or four minute instrumental passages that are ridiculously overdone, full of sound and fury, but existing for no other reason than for ego gratification. Arpeggio after arpeggio, solo after solo; it all becomes incredibly wearing after but a few tracks. If music is a language, Dream Theater is someone who can talk very fast and in a very ornate fashion, but can only speak gibberish. They know no subtlety, and boy does it show here. <br /> <br />It's no surprise, then, that the songs on SFAM are utterly dreadful. This is prog-by-numbers; a time change here, an odd meter there, a lengthy, masturbatory instrumental passage here, etc. There's absolutely nothing here that will make you stop and think \\"wow, what a great riff!\\" or \\"I must hear that again!\\" There's no emotion, no soul, and every endlessly-rehearsed song sounds like it's had all the life and spontaneity sucked out of it. Whatever potential the album had is torpedoed by the band's shameless, relentless excess. Listen Dream Theater, I don't care how many notes you can cram into a measure, how fast you can beat the drums, or what great virtuosos you think you are. I want to hear something I'm going to remember. I want to hear melody. Anything but this mindless wankery. You're simply trying too hard. <br /> <br />Lyrically, the album is trite and pedestrian, taking an interesting story and completely falling flat in their delivery. For those of you who are interested, \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" is a concept album about a man who relives a past life while under hypnosis. Sadly, the \\"story\\" lacks any emotional impact due the coldness and soulless-ness of the music, and James LaBrie's vocals are just plain awful, though not as unlistenable as on \\"Images and Words\\". If a band is going to tell a story, it should at least make me care about what happens, as any author should. \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" had me looking at CD-player's time, wondering when it would finally be over. <br /> <br />No doubt Dream Theater fans will be able to give me a lengthy list of reasons why they love this album, but I found it utterly lacking in soul, passion, and artistic value. Needless to say, this will be the last Dream Theater album I ever listen to.
B00005JODA|3.0|\\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a polished work absent the rage its subject deserves. Noble. Liberal. Emotionally punchless. The ingredients are there. John LeCarre novel. The continued abuse of impoverished Africans. Government corruption. Corporate greed. The death of a beautiful activist. And yet the movie poses as little more than an Amnesty International ad. <br /> <br />Part of it has to do the marriage of the two main characters. Ralph Fiennes plays British diplomat Justin Quayle, stationed in Kenya with much younger wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) a firebrand working for whatever cause she can find that helps the poor in Nairobi. She ruffles the corresponding feathers of whichever organization is giving aid on the cheap or, worse, testing other drugs on AIDS patients. Tessa's research points toward fatal side effects of a certain experimental TB drug. <br /> <br />Justin doesn't know any of this, because he and Tessa have an agreement: She won't tell him. So when Tessa is killed at a remote lake, Justin mourns and discovers her at the same time. The Le Carre novel may better explain theunderstanding Justin and Tessa share, but in the movie it's one-sided even after Tessa's death: A lot of people make a lot of excuses about a woman who essentially drove into her own death while playing some \\"you know our deal\\" lip service to her husband. I don't care if it's unlikely. It's a little inane.  <br /> <br />So while the movie doubles back and shows us the hearts of these two characters, it expects us to care more about a byzantine conspiracy to inocculate millions by killing a couple hundred. The villains being the diffident Danny Huston and Bill Nighy as pitable, slightly dingy diplomats, the edge is lost. Yes, the world absolutely suffers out of bemused ignorance and neglect.  But \\"The Constant Gardener\\" executes fairly empty <br />justice in its second half, as Justin becomes as comfortable with his demise as his wife apparently was.  <br /> <br />It's directed by Fernando Meirelles, whose last film \\"City of God,\\" about the slums of Rio De Janeiro, was cinematic lightning, a vicious, brilliant, candy-colored epic that deserve mention beside the great gangster pictures of any era. Here he employs a curious ethnographic technique: There are tons of random shots of Life in Africa. Weisz plays with kids. People wave at the camera. This a strange grab at prestige, bolstering the movie's case by showing \\"the real thing.\\" Okay at first, eventually annoying. Meirelles doesn't take any of the chances he did in \\"City of God\\"; the scenery is dramatic, but Meirelles relies too much on its beauty. Better films give context to the visuals through camera position and movement. Meirelles is proficient but functional from credit to credit. <br /> <br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" is the same as a whole. Fiennes is in the upper crust of actors, but he's traveled this road in \\"The English Patient\\" and \\"The End of the Affair.\\" He's empty of charisma here. Weisz is a beautiful woman and the movie's only pulse, but she's hampered by a lack of screen time and her role, to some extent, as a near saint.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|This whole CD is amazing. If you're looking for something relaxing with only a couple sounds, this CD is for you. Obviously inspired by works by Steve Reich, these songs you can play over and over again, only getting more complex as they progress.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This Cd is amazing. Definately a different sound for Nine Inch Nails. I really like The Hand That Feeds and Only.
0307276902|3.0|Frey is a good writer, actually a good \\"reteller\\" of his 6 weeks at Hazelden.  Graphic, stunning and very honest, his story is breathtaking for sure.  The way he recalls his past crimes and assaults are heartbreaking too. Most touching and powerful are the moments he has with his parents as he tells them, event by event how he has become the animal in front of them, teetering on the brink of certain death should he choose to drink or drug again.  He was a truly sick, horrible and profoundly addicted guy.   <br />Most disturbing is realizing that in the face of great hope, optimism and change, Frey demands to steadfastly rely on his own \\"self,\\" refusing to allow the light of ANY spirit into his heart. He remains through it all, cold hearted, mean, angry, defiant, resentful, proud and likely, smug.  Through it all it becomes apparent that there's little or no true, humble redemption, in fact, he more or less dries out and returns to the world only to prove that the others in recovery are week and spineless believers in the 12 step programs and a higher power guiding them to a better purpose on the planet. <br />The book is FULL of anger, rage and defiance.  Frey insists that  he is above the laws, codes and  rules of society, Hazelden and  (not) ironically story structure, verse and outcome. <br />Does that mean that because Frey is a jerk that it's not a good story and it's not worth reading? No, of course not.  Reader beware, there's not an \\"Oprah\\" sized silver lining or rainbow at the end. <br />Take a deep breath and read it.  Sigh in relief that places like Hazelden exist and accept anyone willing to clean up.  Be grateful that this kicking and screaming man/child/boy is loose on the streets without a drink or drug fueling him.  Thank God that you're not carrying his pain, rage and arrogance. <br />The old saw about \\"you take a drunken horse thief and sober him up and you're still left with a horse thief\\" is certainly the case here.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This Movie just plain ROCKS !...I truly believe that if there is any negative reviews on this film it would probably be someone who is jealous because they cant make something this awesome. My little brother never played FF VII and he was blown away by this film as well as myself. Go see this movie, you wont regret it !
B000002LQR|5.0|This album is one of their best. I love it. This is my second one. My first was scratched and skipping, so I HAD to buy another.
B0009Y336A|5.0|The last two Supergrass albums, Supergrass and Life On Other Planets, were both mixed affairs.  While their sound, both mellow and energetic respectively, sounded like another step in the right direction, aside from the obvious singles there was a lack of sturdy songs on each disc.  Some three years later Supergrass has returned with their fifth full-length and what a return it is.  Easily their strongest and most consistent album since In It For The Money, Road To Rouen is worth the wait.  This release finds Supergrass mellowing their sound without getting depressing or dull.  The album still bounces around with a great, subtle energy finding all the songs brimming with a slowly growing beauty.  The opening track \\"Tales of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6)\\" starts out as a beautiful acoustic number which then transforms, with the help of some majestic horns ala Ennio Morricone, into a full out blues-stomp rocker.  It's a great example of Supergrass' ability to twist their songs around while staying inside the same groove and now they show this great talent through the course of nine songs.  Unlike prior releases, Road To Rouen stays in the same groove and never seems spastic or inconsistent, even on the hilarious intermission \\"Coffee In The Pot.\\"  Singles \\"St. Petersburg\\" and \\"Low C\\" find Supergrass in full acoustic mode, both songs being prime examples of just how beautiful music can be.  The mini-epic \\"Roxy,\\" the funky rock of the Curtis Mayfield-esque title track, and the shimmering, electric mod-rock of \\"Kick In The Teeth\\" show us that Supergrass can still rock, even if their sound is more sophisticated than the youthful punk of I Should Coco.  Despite all these varying styles, none of the songs seem out of place here.  Every track on Road To Rouen grows more and more classic with every listen, making it the most beautiful album of Supergrass' career and their best in the last eight years.
0385512058|3.0|The advance praises on the back cover from CEOs of AOL, Siemens, Deloitte and Activision certainly guarantees the author's charisma, if not his networking capabilities. Despite some reviewers' complaint against the lack of structured action plans and networking strategies, I am satisfied with the many tactics or methods discussed vividly thru the author's own personal stories. Those sections of \\"Connectors' Hall of Fame\\" profiling Bill Clinton, Dalai Lama, Dale Carnegie and so on are informative and motivating. However, as per my title for this review, I doubt how many readers can have the passion and the \\"sincerity\\" of the author to develop relatively deep, if not close relationships with all his targets, which is the key stratgy of the author himself. Also, as per the chapter \\"Balance is BS\\", the author had manifested his committment on a daily schedule starting 0400 and no indication of when he could go to bed after all those fully scheduled night events. FYI, the author got divorced at least once. I knew so because he had told a story of breaking the ice (and for excusing his getting distracted) through discussing it openly.<br /><br />In case you are very committed to networking, this book may motivate you and offer you some new tactics. If you just want to read for leisure about somebody successful in networking, it's okay though I think \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" is a better choice. However, for the majority of sales practitioners not of those direct marketing type who thrive primarily on personal relationships, you may think that the effort required is too overwhelming, time and money wise.
B0002PUH2Y|5.0|I dont speak one word of spanish but Im am for some reason into latin music. I have recently purchased Shakira, and Thalia - El Sexto Sentido and some other new english albums but NONE can conpare to this album. <br /> <br />Almost every song is just great to hear. Words cannot describe this album. You must listen to the songs for yourself. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this album to ANYONE who is a fan of music. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are: <br /> <br />1. Men Senara (8/10) <br />4. Siempre Me Quedara (7.5/10) <br />5. Malo (10/10) <br />6. Ska De La Tierra (9.5/10) <br />7. El Colpe (7.5/10) <br />11. Siete Horas (8/10) <br /> <br />Thats right I have 6 favorite songs from just one album.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I had not played any FF game before. However, as a TV game fan (Biohazard, Devil May Cry, Metal Gear Solid series), I am always fascinated by the superb CG of Square, in particular those trailers from FF8 onwards.  Watching FF AC is like experiencing an ACT game and enjoying the marvelous CG trailers without the need to go thru hours of gameplay. Some may dislike it. However, as an impatient and slow middle aged man, I like that a lot. I had watched FF Spirit Within. Nevertheless, it just resembles too much a Hollywood cartoon (in particular the character and the costume design) and lacks style. FF AC basically removes all the shortcomings of FF SW. Nothwithstanding the story (hard to compare coz FF SW is an original creation whilst FF AC is an extension of FF7 the game), FF AC got better of everything as per my review title. The action/fighting scenes are simply the best I had watched so far for a CG movie. In short, dont miss it.<br /><br />p.s. I expected to press the fast forward button regularly per my experience with many Japanese CG movies. I could hardly do so for FF AC.
B000AL730Y|3.0|I to have listened to Paul's new album 7/8 times and my conclusion is this, its a good album with a few delights such as the brilliant 'Jenny Wren'. The intention of the single 'Fine Line' was to gain at least a top 10 placing and garnish hugh album sales. 'Fine line' has proved it is not strong enough to do this, and in truth is an average album track. There is no commercial McCartney except maybe the ballads 'This Never happened Before' & 'Anyway'. I have found the album lacking in uptempo tunes, there is only 3 on Chaos. McCartney should do a flip like Tug of War/Pipes Of Peace and release his next album with the title from my review piece, on this album he should record 10 uptempo rockers and a couple of ballads. There is no better songwriter on the planet even at the age of 63 that can turn out brilliant commercial hit singles/albums. Paul come out from the cloak your hiding behind and get commercial. When you get right down to it, its what you do best.
0156027321|5.0|To Kill a Mockingird has been my favorite novel for many many years. I didn't think I'd really enjoy The Life of Pi by Yann Martel, but I was wrong. It is a beautiful, terrifying, horrific, fantastical, sad, poignant, uplifting, surprising, astonishing, and lovely lovely tale of a young boy's drifting (literally) into real life. But what is real life? Is it reality--or is it the better story? I  cannot make myself believe in his \\"better story\\"-- but oh, I wish I could. To kill a mOCKINBIRD remains my favorite book of all times, but <br />The Life of Pi is perhaps second or third, right behind The Member of the Wedding, by Carson McCullers. And if each of these stories is about a young person learning about life the hard way, well, yes--isn't that what most good stories are about? tHE ENDING OF Life of Pi blew me away. But of course, sadly, the second ending is the \\"real\\" one--or is it? I think I prefer \\"the better story.\\"
0596007124|5.0|I've bought several design patterns books and on the suggestion of a forum decided to try this one. At first glance I wasn't sure what to think, but I was soon seduced into reading the first 75 pages in one sitting. Not only is it engaging (like a comic book almost), but I actually understood the patterns being discussed and the OO principles behind them. I'd never gotten that out of my other books. In fact, I thought I knew about OO design until reading this book, now I think I really understand them. <br /> <br />The book does employ a lot of interesting tricks: graphics, humor, and a lot of changes in format to keep your attention. I have to say it works. But, if you're looking for a conventional technical book look elsewhere.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|Beware of spoilers here: <br /> <br />This film is totally enjoyable.  Once again Carrey shows that he is capable of serious acting and not just the goofy stuff.  He really is a wonderful talent and I still continue to wonder why he did so many of those toilet humor movies.   <br /> <br />The premise of the film is fresh and entertaining.  In these days of reality television can a show like this be too far off in the distance?  I think not.  Here's the premise.  Carrey plays a poor unsuspecting soul named Truman.  He was an orphan who was sort of adopted by a televison show producer.  His whole world is fake.  His parents, his wife, best friend, neighborhood, job, etcetera.  The weather, the sun, wind, rain.  All fake.  Everyone in his world is an actor.  Even his town was a set.  Cameras were hidden everywhere.  The whole world watched Truman as he grew up.  His first steps, his first day at school.  Everything.  Can't you just hear Hollywood's wheels turning as they try to figure out a way to make this happen one day?   <br /> <br />The Truman show is such a hit that people in the real world have trouble functioning and living their own lives because they can't stop watching it.  It's on 24 hours a day.  There's the premise for reality t.v. Are we really so bored with our own lives that we have to tune in to watch what's going on in someone else's family?   <br /> <br />Truman starts to notice little strange things around him.  A light seemingly falls from the sky as he's on his way to work.  The radio announces that it fell from a plane but we know that it was one of the studio lights.  He also pines away for a girl that he never really had a chance to have a relationship with because the network already had a wife planned for him.  They can control his world but they can't remove his memories.  He also he a desire to travel but he lives on an island (or so it seemed to him) but he has a paralyzing fear of water because he saw his father drown in a storm at sea.Actually, the father was fired (from the show) and the station decided to kill him off.  The man who played his father slips back on to the set one day and Truman sees him before the actors who play security guards and cops hustle him off the set.  Things start to fall apart for the show after that. <br /> <br />Laura Linney plays Truman's make believe wife.  She plays his wife strictly for the cash and fame.  Ed Harris is excellent as the producer/director of the Truman Show.  He feels like he is Truman's real father since he's the one that's been taking care of him all of his life. <br /> <br />Things finally come to a head and Truman has sort of a showdown with his creator.  I won't say what happens but when the transmission of the Truman Show is cut, what do the folks that have been watching faithfully for years do?  Turn the channel to see what else is on. <br /> <br />This film raises some interesting questions.  Should we make a person's life a subject for our own entertainment?  Can we really be so disinterested with our own lives that viewing someone else's  life fulfills us?  Just how far will the entertainment industry go to make a buck? <br /> <br />To those of you who are not Jim Carrey fans, I urge you to give The Truman show a try.  Yes, Carrey is still a crazy, zany, rubberfaced guy but his range of acting abilities is remarkable to say the least.  There really is talent inside that brain of his.   <br /> <br />There is no sex or violence to speak of here.  It's okay for young children although the concept could be difficult to grasp.  Enjoy!
B00005JNTX|1.0|While yes I know Sin City is based on Frank Miller's graphic novels and does indeed work hard to look like a comic book in all its noir glory. Unfortunately, a movie should do more than just look great. The throwaway dialogue and cliche self-destructive characters coupled with the non-stop over the top violence, seems to have no point, other than to overload us with bullets and blood, not to mention enough view of skin, to keep teenage boys busy for awhile. Rent it first, before shelling out money for yet another inflated movie.
B000001DTM|5.0|I was befuddled when I first heard the great Acthung. U2 was always a band to reinvent themselves, but this was a total departure. There was something heavy, something menacing to the sound, like the end of the world. But this is the particular draw of this album- it's gravity. There aren't really any anthems, just really tight and fuzzy guitar hooks and muffled vocals. The sound is still big U2. There's a lot of stuff going on in this album, both universally and personally with the band. They had announced their official break up on tour, but decided to keep it together. Instead of destroying themselves, they destroyed the old U2 and came up with one of the most brilliant albums of all time.
B00000K31Q|4.0|This is an excellent, very funny movie.  I reccomend it to anyone who wants to spend a night watching a light movie.
B00005K9QP|5.0|during the swinging sixties, there was a serious and scholarly reverence for american, blues music. spearheading the movement was a guy called john mayall. being a part of his band meant going to an elite blues school and being under the strict rules of the mayall blues regime. you had to do things his way. eric clapton was a devout follower but for one great studio album. he then walked away from the austerity of john's compound in order to do cream. this album is, never the less, one of the most seminal and inspirational, blues guitar albums of all time. anyone that i know, who considers himself to be a serious guitar player, has this album, without fail.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I loved the movie in the theater so much, I saw it three times! <br />The DVD treatment of the film definitely does it justice.  This film adaptation of the stage show is wonderfully accurate, and gorgeous to look at. <br /> <br />My favorite part is definitely \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,\\" when Christine sings in the graveyard, walking through the silent snow.  Emmy Rossum has the voice of an angel, singing Christine with great prowess, especially considering that she was only 17 years old during the filming of Phantom.  The only critism I have for the film is that Gerard Butler is not a very good singer as the Phantom.  This is quite significant, since he sings a lot, but his acting performance is very good, and the amazing Patrick Wilson's Raoul makes up for Butler's shortcomings. <br /> <br />Excellent movie, fantastic DVD.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|The first reason any person will watch this movie for, is the action.  It's not a modern action movie by any means, but it has some really good shoot-outs.  But that's not why I bought this movie.  I'm at an incredibly dull college so I was looking for something to do in the boredom, so I started taking the movies I have and analyzing them, once I got through them I started buying some more just to pass time.  This Movie is easily the best western ever made.  <br /> <br />The Director of this movie isn't American, at the time he made it, he didn't even speak english.  But many of the elements are so much more authentic than American westerns.  The clothing and settings for instance.  One thing that stands out is the background characters, they're all very rugged, worn down, some don't have legs, others have no arms, Angel Eyes is missing the tip of one of his fingers, which you can see if you look close enough.  This lends so much to the gritty feel of the west.  Another element that is downright amazing is how Sergio Leone (the director) uses close-ups and Panoramas, typically a movie specializes in one or the other, this movie has amazing panoramas and then, seconds later, a close-up showing the ruggedness of a character (the first scene where Tuco is introduced stands out, with the man who trys to kill Tuco).  All three of the characters balance out as well, and all of them are well developed.  Blondie (Eastwood) is quiet, contemplative and smarter than the other two in many ways.  Tuco (Wallach) never stops talking, and is always looking for a way to earn money, or to take revenge on the others in the movie.  Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) is thoroughly evil, and he fits the part of a scheming and evil man very well, with his thin eyes and evil chuckle. <br /> <br />One of my favorite parts of the movie is the Dialogue.  For instance, \\"...even so, I know that I have a brother who'll never refuse me.\\"  Or, \\"Hooray for the Confederacy, God is on our side, he hates the Yankees too!!! (Tuco) No, God is not on out side, he hates idiots too.(Blondie)\\"  Which he says as the officer that just rode up reveals a blue uniform covered in gray dust.  And lastly, \\"See you soon, id...idi.... (Tuco), Idiots, It's for you (Blondie).\\"  There are many other incredible lines that speak so much to viewers, like many of the things that the Yankee army captain says about the horrors and stupidity of war and leaders (about some unimportant bridge that could save thousands of soldiers lives if it were just blown up instead of fighting over it). <br /> <br />Pick up this movie for it's action, watch it for the depth, you'll enjoy it.
0780021967|5.0|The film is captivating and thoroughly enjoyable, and demonstrates Hitchcock's skill as a director even in the early days. The transfer IS gorgeous, both for picture and audio. It's amazing how good a 1935 movie can be made to look and sound. Thank you, Criterion for this excellent restoration!
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is the best Smashing Pumpkins cd ever. I loved it! It was too spectacular so I listened to it all night. One of my most favourite cds of all time. I mostly enjoy the guitaring from James Iha. Billy Corgan is very poetic, one of the best music poets of all time. His music have no doubt one of the best lyrics. My favourite song on this cd was Rocket because it had a catchy beat. Especially the chorus. I enjoyed that song, even though it gained not much popularity. Smashing Pumpkins also made great music videos for this album. The awesome, superb song Today had an awesome music video, showing Billy driving an ice cream truck and explaining how he wanted more than he could grant for. This is such a great cd. Oh man, it is one of my most favourite of all time. But I can't classify it as one of the best ever. The reason for this is it didn't really gain much popularity until 1994 and when Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness was released. I liked Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness more, but yeah this cd was still a five star classic.
B000005JA8|5.0|You've heard it all before: \\"It's just noise\\", \\"My toddler can play drums better than that\\" or maybe even \\"It's sooooo pretentious\\"...    Then you take a look at the Wish Carts of these people, or perhaps you are unlucky enough to take a peek at their record/CD collection, and you suddenly realize why they hate this album.    Captain Beefheart is to music what Picasso was to art. I used to look at Picasso and say \\"This sucks! He can't draw! He's a fraud!\\" Then I found a book of Picasso's sketchbooks at the library, and I was shocked: He COULD draw, and he was EXCELLENT at it!    It took years for me to realize that Picasso was exploring primitive-looking art because he was BORED with drawing realistic images. He wanted to capture multiple dimensions of reality in one painting-- string theory for the avant-garde art world, really!    Captain Beefheart is a Cubist songwriter, if you ask me. His music is meant to be heard several different ways SIMULTANEOUSLY. And for those who think he lacks talent, go out and find the recordings he did with Ry Cooder in the mid-Sixties. Like my discovery of Picasso's sketchbooks, hearing those early Beefheart recordings proved to me that he COULD be linear and commercial if he so desired... Thank God his desire to be accepted and loved by the world was lacking, or else \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" might've never been made!    [...] There is no conspiracy to elevate this album above its status, because it was an INSTANT CLASSIC and has never been surpassed by anyone or anything.     You can't get any higher than INSTANT CLASSIC status.    It's not for everyone, true, but I pity the people who don't \\"get it\\". They like bands like The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and you could probably find the other CDs they like in a 99 cent bargain bin at Amoeba.    Keep this in mind: Captain Beefheart, aka Don Van Vliet, is a sculptor and a painter. Around the world, his abstract art (the kind of stuff I used to sneer at before I fully understood it) is respected and revered. He was a sculpting prodigy as a child and was offered the chance to study with masters in Europe. His parents thought otherwise, but Beefheart had the genius and vision to make himself known, in the rock world (of all places!)...    Therefore, I say unto you: if you don't have an artistic bone in your body, don't bother with this album. Hell, you may be a well-respected gallery artist and STILL hate this album... but I'd bet the farm that your CD collection probably sucks big time as well...    It's a symptom of the age.
B00008CLOA|5.0|After 30 years these guys are still great and this 5.1SACD is an experience of delight.
B00005JO0J|5.0|First, the other reviews are spot on.  I can not add to their depth of coverage, so I will just add my small voice to the chorus.  In my opinion, this movie is the best one released this year.  Period. In any category, class, genre, you name it.  Whatever the second best movie might be, is simply canine excrement to be scraped from the bottom of my shoe, in comparison (yes, I am pointing my finger at you, Mr. Lucas). <br /> <br />Is the Serenity movie better than the Firefly series?  Well, it is simply not possible to exceed that benchmark.  But I will say that this movie is equal to the same high standards that Joss has established.  The story, plot, writing, and acting are superb.  The result is an experience that tickles all the emotions, so expect to laugh, cheer, and yes, bring some tissues too.
B000AJJNPY|4.0|A beautiful album, but the packaging is completely useless.  Be very careful when you pull out your cd.  Be mindful of how the cd is sitting in the pocket.  You may have to bend the back cover a bit.  Otherwise, Yeah, as one reviewer put it \\"Makes you want to move mountains\\"
B00003XAVA|5.0|I bought this LP the day it came out. I saw the tour and even took some very good pictures of this time in David and Graham's career. They played Moody Colliseum on the SMU campus in Dallas. Compared to some of their later work this album stood the test of time. With Russ Kunkell on drums, Leland Skylar on bass and all assorted guests these guys laid down some tremendous songs and soaring harmonies. To The Last Whale made me mad and sad at the same time. I mean killing whales for eyemake-up. If you have ever been on the water in a boat next to one of these gentle giants the song hits home. The guys in this backup band were the most sought after session men in L.A. for years. They were tight. Once again I lived this album. I put it on cassette the day I got it and I know every song by heart. I can't help it. I love these guys. These musicians both influenced my songwriting and my desire to seek music as a career. This album moved me very much.
0671799320|5.0|This book is fantastic.  Gripping, well-written, insightful.  It tracks the history of a business that has gone from total anarchy to total centralization (and back again), from the iron grip of the West to the single most important threat to Western existence.  Critical to understanding our world today and what challenges we face going forward.
B000929AJQ|5.0|This album is amazing. There are no words to explain how amazing but I will do my best. <br /> <br />Until very recently I was barely a fringe fan of NIN. I liked \\"Head Like a Hole\\" and \\"The Downward Spiral\\" albums, but little else. My wife is a total addict to everything NIN has ever released, in fact she almost has every disc they have ever put out. So when \\"With Teeth\\" came out I got it for her within the first week. Ever since then it's been a struggle over who gets to take the album with them that day. <br /> <br />From start to finish it is one of the best made albums ever recorded. Technically it has all the polish of a true masterwork. The lead ins and sound engineering are excellent. the vocals are meaningful and thoughtful without being overly dreary or artsy-fartsy. The music has an edge and tone to it that is sure to thrill most hardcore NIN fans or anyone that really wants some good tonefull angry/melancholy rock. To explain the sound of NIN is impossible but the best I can think of is Heavy Metal, House, Trance, Progressive, Grunge, throw into a blender, push puree' and serve hot at full volume. <br /> <br />It's a wild ride. <br /> <br />The album has only one \\"weak\\" spot in a track that I can't listen to every day. Not because it is bad, which it isn't. But because it gives me a headache with it's pulsing bass. It has to be played at higher volumes due to it's subtlety but that means the long moaning bass has a chance to really numb your eardrums. Honestly, the singles \\"Bite the Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"Only\\" are great tracks, but they barely give a glimmer of how great this CD is. This is a MUST have album!!!!
B00005AQGH|5.0|A lyrical genius. This album is simply the bomb. 2Pac or Makaveli as he is now known has done it again. <br /> <br />Toks, <br /> <br />London, UK
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|CASINO is the third installment of Martin Scorsese's True Crime tryptych. MEAN STREETS and GOODFELLAS preceded it, and highlighted low-level street crime and workaday organized crime. Based on a true story, CASINO takes us inside the glitzy yet seedy universe of Las Vegas in the 1970s, a period when Mob influence reached its apex and then fell, dizzyingly fast.<br /><br />Scorsese brilliantly reunites most of the GOODFELLAS crew for this three hour epic. Robert DeNiro plays \\"Ace\\" Rothstein, de facto boss of the Tangiers, while Joe Pesci plays Nicky, his closest friend, bitterest rival, and muscle. Sharon Stone garnered an Oscar nomination for her role as Ginger, a former showgirl/call girl turned Rothstein's wife, who basically makes his life miserable, abuses their daughter, and runs back to her scrawny no-account pimp (James Woods) at every opportunity.<br /><br />Pesci's \\"Nicky\\" is GOODFELLAS' \\"Tommy\\" with a bank account. More conniving and calculating than Tommy, Nicky is just as amoral and violent. Pesci taps the underlying sociopathic core of the character, drawing it forth like an oil well of evil, and making Nicky the ugly face of CASINO's enclosed world.<br /><br />DeNiro is the handsome face of Vegas, addicted to crazily color-coordinated suits, charming the high rollers, torturing the scam artists, and trying to run a good operation while earning for the boys back home.<br /><br />Both Ace and Nicky are over-the-top characterizations, all the more true to life in Vegas. As Ace muses at one point, \\"Anywhere else they'd put me in jail. Here they give me civic awards.\\"<br /><br />Their private empire collapses in the end, not so much because of their many excesses, but because they simply outlived their time. The general crackdown on organized crime in the 1980s consumed Las Vegas as well, turning it from a hardcore, all-adult playground into Disneyland with roulette wheels. As the wiseguys vanished the corporations flourished.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that CASINO starts off too slowly. As in GOODFELLAS, Scorsese uses the voice over technique, this time alternating between Ace and Nicky. Scorsese errs at the outset. The voice overs are so dominant in the first half hour that the film slips into documentary mode; however, the cast quickly finds their feet and redeems the remaining two-and-a-half-hours of this film with amazing, engaging performances.<br /><br />Running a far distant second to GOODFELLAS in Scorsese's canon, CASINO is still a fine film, and is a fascinating glimpse into that real world where all of life spins black and red.in GOODFELLAS, Scorsese uses the voice over technique, this time alternating between Ace and Nicky.

B000AADYRQ|4.0|I heard of Death Cab For Cutie a while back, but forgot about them fairly quickly, all the while hating their name. Fairly recently, I heard a few Postal Service songs and became a little more interested. I have since aquired all of DCFCs' releases and can't seem to get enough of them; Transatlanticism quickly becoming my favorite of the bunch. Imagine my joy when I read \\"the new one\\" was coming. I immediately liked this album, I will say that. Standouts include the absurdly catchy \\"Crooked Teeth\\", \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\", the opening track \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" and the weep-inducing \\"I will Follow You Into the Dark\\". I didn't find this album all that different than past releases, but then, I don't know that it needs to be. Sure, Plans doesn't hit home like Transatlanticism, but any new DCFC is a good thing, don't ya think? Don't know? Plans is a more-than-adequate place to start. Find out.
B00008ADPF|5.0|Even if the song are sappy it's still great. My all time favorite song in life is SOMEDAY. It's girly and sappy, but I love it. Nickleback is great, heartfelt, and just plain fun to listen to even if they are melodramatic..
B0002S947K|5.0|This is a really good CD that grows on you the more you listen too it . Trouble is not the best song on the cd but i can see it being the one that gets the radio play .
0471267554|4.0|THERE ARE SO MANY DIETS TODAY, ONE CAN HARDLY MAKE AN INTELLLIGENT CHOICE. EACH HAS ITS COMPLICATED REASONS FOR BEINB THE BEST. IN CASE OF THE PALEO DIET THESE REASONS ARE EASILY COMPRREHENSIBLE AND MAKE SENSE,
B00005JODA|5.0|Moving political thriller that has the right combination of wit, emotion and noir to make this among the best films of its nature. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz give the best performance of the year in a thrilling look at the evils of corruption and the ways its willing to stoup to cover up its own practices. Fiennes is great as the wounded man trying to come to grips with the way the world really works in his quest for answers for his wife's murder. His performance is his best in quite some time and Rachel Weisz is just amazing, giving a performance that not only proves her to be the most versatile and talented actresses working today but almost locks her up for a Oscar nomination with one of the best performances of the year if not the best.  <br /> <br />It's a strong and moving theater experience and it will not leave you once the movie ends.  <br /> <br />

B0007VZ9DK|2.0|Amazon was nice enough to replace this movie after it wouldn't budge at the 96 minute mark.  Unfortunately, the replacement disk was also defective, freezing multiple times.  I thought it was just me, but read that another reviewer had the same problem.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|For an amazingly low price, you get 14 episodes of Science Fiction with a Western twist. Thankfully, the author(s) don't try to dwell on the technical explanations of space travel or other developments of the future. Instead they've woven a plot and story line that develops over many episodes, and focuses on character development. Although seeing a single episode is fun, the real fun is making the connections between the details that are slowly revealed over many episodes; why did Shepherd Book get such sudden and unexpected help from the Alliance? Considering he's a preacher, how come he knows so much about crime and weapons? And what's the story with River, anyway? Two by two, hands of blue? <br /> <br />Lots of buzz about this one. I expect to see a revival of the series, TV, DVD and/or theater.
B00003CXCT|2.0|George Lucas has a nasty habit of making \\"improvements\\" because he can, not because they'll add anything to the story. <br /> <br />1. We see the rump of a big beast blocking the camera at Mos Eisley station. <br />2. Luke screams when he jumps into the shaft at Cloud City to escape Vader.  To make matters worse, it's not a Mark Hamill scream, it's a recycled Emperor scream from when HE is thrown down the shaft in RotJ! <br />3. Stock footage of RotJ Death Star scenes slipped in to ESB. Like we weren't going to notice? <br />4. The worst offense of all, and the one thing that has made me put the long-awaited DVD box set away and stick to my old, battered VHS copies: Hayden Christiansen has been \\"gumped\\" in at the end when Luke sees Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda standing together during the Ewok celebration.  How in the heck does it make sense for HAYDEN CHRISTIANSEN to be in that scene?  Of all the pointless, stupid, idiotic things for GL to do, that ruins the whole thing for me. Why gump Hayden Christiansen in there and not Ewan MacGregor?  Because it was Alec Guiness, that's why, or he'd probably have done the same thing.  Mr. Lucas:  step away....from the edit button!
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica is one of the most innovative metal bands of all time period. I can't really explain in words how great early Metallica is. The word Metallica alone turns the heads of all metalheads and rock fans alike. Lately, Metallica has fallen apart and has turned into some kind of crappy nu metal band(see St. Anger). It is sad when you see a band that used to be so great, sell out like that (I place all blame MTV and Electra Records; for ruining Metallica), but their early days were golden and unbelievable.  <br /> <br /> I remember the first time I listened to Metallica; it was an unbelievable Revelation; from their on I gave up KoRn( and nu metal in general) and started listening to real rock. ....And Justice For All has to be Metallica's most complex album, like a fellow reviewer said. Metallica was going through some rough times, with the loss of their bass player Cliff Burton. This time around Jason Newstead steps up to the plate with big shoes to fill. In ....And Justice For All their are able to pull off a great album, despite the hardship; with Kirk Harmmet and Lars Ulrich displaying some of their best shredding in their entire careers, with some sick guitar solos and some awesome machine gun drumming. <br /> <br /> Yet their were some production flaws that, kind of brought down the album, for example Jason Newstead's bass playing was damaged by the choppy sound and terrible mixing, which really put him out of the spotlight. Yet, Newstead played an important part in songwriting for this album as well as The Black Album. As a bass player, though he can't really compare to Cliff Burton, but still becomes an important part of Metallica. James Hetifield as at vocals( the voice of metal), does a great job, not being as agressive as his performances Kill em' All or Ride the Lightning, but still does a great job. <br />  <br /> ....And Justice For All, has to be Metallica's most mature album, changing their music style, along with adding more to the songs. This album has to be the best put together Metallica album out their; can't top Master of Puppets, but is really great. ....And Justice For All, is probably the most under-rated  Metallica album, with some people complaining about the sound production or the album taking a bit more of a mature and more complex feel, instead of that Raw edge. In, fact their are elements of \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\" mixed together, along with some new tricks. I see what people mean when they say that this band was Rage before the mechines; as the speaki in their songs about injustice. <br /> <br /> This album contains a great combination of songs like the legendary \\"One\\", the speedy and agressive \\"Blackened\\", along with the instrumental \\"Frayed Eyes of Sanity\\", and much more. The album is gold from beginning to end; showing what Metallica can do!!! This album has to be actually one of the greatest albums of all time, never failing to sastify. This album is still in fact selling after being on the market for about 17-18 years latter with fans still raving about how great it is. That fact alone tells you what kind of impact early Metallica 1983-1990 left on the music industry. I listen to this Cd pretty much every day. If your a new Metallica fan this and Master of the Puppets should, be the first two you should look into. Metallica is called \\"Mighty Metallica\\" for a reason!!! <br /> <br /> Now here's a basic overview of the songs which rate anywhere from 0/+10; +10 being the highest and 0 being the absolute lowest. Everything on this album will be 9 or above so you have nothing to worry about. <br /> <br />Rating System: <br /> <br />+10/ An unbelievably awesome; an classic/ an divine masterpiece. <br />10/An awesome song, a materpiece <br />9.5/ An awesome song, that is very fun to listen to <br />9/An awesome song <br />8.5/A really great song <br />8/Great song <br />7.5/ A great song, with some flaws <br />7/A pretty good song <br />6.5/ A good song with some cruical flaws <br />6/ An above average song, nothing special <br />5.5/ A below average song that falls short <br />5/ A plainly bad song <br />4.5/ A very bad song <br />4/ Not a good song at all; boring; repetive; or plainly bad <br />3.5/ A very suck ass; sad excuse for a song <br />3/ A very,very suck ass; sad excuse for a song <br />2.5/ My ears are starting to bleed <br />2/ Barely considered music <br />1.5/ At this point it's now considered trash <br />1/ I'd rather tear my ears off than ever listen to that again. <br />0/ Rather set myself on fire, and beat my self up, while being attacked by a wild man eating bear, and being hit over the head by a sledge hammer, than ever listen to this again.  <br />-1 or below/ An absolute masterpiece OMG(sarcasm)...... by this point really you get the idea it's not something you should listen too. <br /> <br />Blackened/+10/ I myself really loved this song and is an fine example of what Metallica. With the fast and agressive vocals with Hammert's famous guitar solos and Ulrich's machine gun drumming; constantly twisting and changing in tempo. This is truly a work of art and a masterpoiece. An Personal Favorite!!! <br /> <br />...And Justice For All/9.5/ One long motha... clocking in at almost 10 minutes in lengeth. Very fast and agressive, speaks out against unjustice; and really packs a punch. Not my absolute favorite, but heck of a good song. <br /> <br />Eye of the Beholder/9.5/ Great song, has elements of Blackened and ... And Justice For All, blended into it. Great guitar action as well. Great song in general, but nothing to make this legendary, at all.... yet respectable. <br /> <br />One/+10/ This has to be one of Metallica's most powerful and moving songs of all time. It tells a tale about a soldier who lost both his sight and hearing, due to a land mine( during Vietnam) it starts off slow and staedy similar to Fade to Black see Ride the Lightning. Then it turns into a series of heavy guitar solos and such. This is the highlight of the album along with Blackened. This is one of Metallica's greatest songs of all time. <br /> <br />The Shortest Straw/9.5/ One of the shorter songs on the album, but still very fast and agressive. A catcy song as well, but nothing compared to One, but still some kick @$$ metal to go. Love tempo changes, very fast, very agressive period. <br /> <br />Harvester of Sorrow/9/ Has more an evil feel, probably the weakest song on tha album though. Kind of similar to Dyer's Eve, revealing Hetifield's troubled past and how relationships break. Loved the sound effects of the Imperial Walkers. <br /> <br />Frayed Eyes of Sanity/9.5/ More of an instrumental song, starting off with the Wizard of Oz theme, than turns right into  metal maddness with the guitar blaring. A great song for head banging. <br /> <br />To Live Is To Die/9.5/ This song is an complete instrumental song; like Call of the Ktulu and Pulling Teeth; kind of dedicated to their lost friend Cliff Burton(R.I.P), I loved it!!! <br /> <br />Dyer's Eve/10/ A plainly great song almost as good as Blackened themed like Harvester of Sorrow, talking more about personal issues very fast and agressive, could of maybe used a longer solos besides that the song is nearly perfect and showcases what the band is capable of doing. <br /> <br /> Overall, ... And Justice for All is an great album, could have possibly been the best, vut due to the sound production. It still deserves a lot of credit. An absolute masterpiece. Metallica's most complex album for certain, I must say. <br /> <br /> I rate this a 9.5/10 or by the Amazon.com Rating system a 5/5. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006CXSS|5.0|\\"Band of Brothers\\" is an excellent docudrama of the 101st Airborne Division, Easy Company's training, and military exploits including D-Day, the failed Operation Market Garden, triumphant survival during the Battle of the Bulge, and subsequent forays into Germany and Austria until the Allied victory in World War II. The series contains an excellent format in which each episode is preceded by the accounts of aged Easy Company veterans who both set the tone for the drama that follows and who remind us that (unlike \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"), this is not a Hollywood adventure film-it's the real thing. Each episode is based on a true story and none of the characters in this series is fictional.     The DVD series also contains some excellent supplementary material. Each episode also includes a brief summary, biographical information of the principle individuals, and historical details about World War II, the American military, and maps that pinpoint Easy Company's progress.    The most remarkable aspect of this series is that it allows us to witness life in Easy Company from a variety of situations including training, leave, deployment, and combat, as well as a variety of perspectives. We see the entire life of the company from the lowest ranking soldier, to the executive officers and we experience issues ranging from killing and surviving on the battlefield to navigating through the thick military bureaucracy.        Not surprisingly, the most sympathetic people in this series are the non-commissioned officers who provide the actual leadership of the company under all circumstances. When Easy Company is lead by competent field officers such as Winters, Compton, and Spears, the NCOs simply augment their effectiveness with their own professionalism and understanding of the day-to-day realities of their men. In some situation, however, Easy Company is lead by incompetent officers such as the hapless Lt. Dike who (like our President) is given command because of his connectionsbut proves vacant and cowardly during a crisis when leadership is most needed. In such situations, command of the company unofficially and almost unnoticeably falls to the NCOs who must hold things together and make them work in place of the leadership needed from above.    Equally as interesting is the mindset of Easy Company. Veterans who have survived training and battles together command the respect of green replacements. Even returning veterans, who have missed out on a battle or two because of their wounds, are not given an instant welcome but must prove themselves on the battlefield again.    \\"Band of Brothers\\" inevitably contains many dramatic moments since it examines battlefield heroism, survival, fear, despair, killing, and the horror of seeing your buddies die. Unlike \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" however, this series manages to be dramatic without being melodramatic. \\"Band of Brothers\\" simply recounts events and explores some of the feelings behind those events and fortunately, it does so without moralizing or sentimentalizing as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" wound up doing.    After watching this series I came to see the \\"greatest generation\\" of World War II veterans in a new light. It's not so much that they were better than our generation or that we are worse than theirs. It's just that they had great leaders and a just foreign policy, which motivated them to unite and make sacrifices for the greater good. Unfortunately there is no such leadership or foreign policy in place today. Consequently, despite the fact that Americans are hungry to serve their country in a meaningful way, they simply can't unless they figure it out on their own. You see, right now, we are all under the leadership of Lt. Dike and the only thing he's good at is serving himself or chickening out during combat.
0790729350|5.0|I wasn't born when Woodstock happened, but I always empathized with the 60s-- the hope and idealism, the noncommercialism, and the way that bands just jammed their hearts out.  Just put the first Woodstock against the megacommercial, metalhead-violent Woodstock 1999, and you'll see what I mean.  I was born 30 years too late, man!<br /><br />This documentary almost makes you feel like you're there.  You get not only the great jams, you get building the stage before, meanderings through the crowd for Yoga sessions, slip-n-slide through rainy mud, and playful skinny-dipping, even the cleanup after.<br /><br />Santana was my personal favorite of the bands-- it's as if the gods speak through his guitar, even today.  It's cool to see almost glam-punk Who in their prime.  Janis Joplin is SO good belting her heart out-- maybe not as technically good as Joan Baez, but a lot more raw.  Of course, Jimi shreds too.<br /><br />I dig CSN, but their harmonic melodies sound better on album than live IMHO.  Sly & the Family Stone was also musically disappointing-- bad transfer quality maybe-- but Sly's voice getting hundreds of thousands to shout \\"HIGHER!\\" is a peak moment.<br /><br />This film is exhilirating if you dig the 60s sound and scene-- but also slightly depressing in a way, knowing that this precious moment is gone, and that I could never take part.

0451197879|5.0|I think it's safe to say that Roadwork is King's least-read novel, largely because it represented an attempt on King's part to go straight, to prove he could write a mainstream novel.  Written in between 'Salem's Lot and The Shining, Roadwork was released in 1981 as Richard Bachman's third novel.  I first read it as a young teenager, and I no longer remembered a great deal about it - except that, at the time, I did find it somewhat boring.  King himself has never gone so far as to call Roadwork a good novel.  Reading it again now, though, I was surprised by the sophistication and emotional power of the story.  You almost have to have experienced some of the pressures of adulthood to really relate to the protagonist, Barton George Dawes, and it really doesn't matter that the story is imbedded in the socioeconomic worries of the early 1970s.  In its essence, Roadwork is the story of a man pushed beyond his means of coping with change.<br /><br />On the face of things, Dawes doesn't have it that bad.  He has a good wife, a good job, and friends.  Inside, though, he is suffering miserably - and has been since his little boy died of a brain tumor three years earlier.  Having never allowed himself to grieve properly, his mind proves unable to bear the disruptions caused by a new local road construction project.  He's worked for the same laundry since he got out of school, and it will have to relocate elsewhere because of the roadwork - and he is the one responsible for finding a new site.  He's lived in the same house since he got married, and it too has a fateful date with a wrecking ball - and he has to find a new home for him and his wife.  It's just too much for him, and he can't do it.  He lets the deal fall through on the new laundry site, which costs him his job, and he doesn't even go looking for a new house.  Haunted by dreams of his dead son, he's already a broken man - even before he loses his wife and basically his whole life.<br /><br />We the readers basically watch Bart Dawes go insane as the days pass.  We watch him lie to his wife and to himself, drink himself into nightly stupors, procure destructive objects from dangerous men, and plot revenge on those who have taken away the few things in life he could cling to.  At the center of his problem is Charlie; George can't understand why his son had to die, and he can't bear the thought of his home, Charlie's home, being destroyed.  The plot is somewhat analogous to that of the film Falling Down.  Even as we watch Dawes do some terrible things, we can't help but sympathize with a man so beaten down by the cruel vagaries of life.<br /><br />King has said that Roadwork was in some ways a product of the death of his mother.  After working hard to raise King and his brother single-handedly, she died just as King's material success as a writer was beginning.  The book served as a vehicle to let him work through his own emotional issues over his loss.  Why does a loved one have to die?  That question permeates this novel.  It's a very personal story, but it is one almost any adult reader can relate to very well.  King fans who have passed this novel by would do well to go back and give it a chance - it's much different from King's other novels, but it is a surprisingly impressive exploration of emotional disintegration.ically watch Bart Dawes go insane as the days pass.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|Never thought they'd put out a relevant album again after the dismal Blaze years.  Not to mention the lackluster efforts of the early 90's -- NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING and FEAR OF THE DARK.  But this album isn't only relevant; it's essential and one of the landmark metal albums of the 2000's so far.  Dickinson has never sounded better.  He has better control of his amazing pipes now.  He has nuance.  Adrian and Dave and Steve and Nicko are doing what they do and they're doing it better than ever.  I'm not really sure what Janick does to be honest.  I'm not familiar with his playing and I'm not sure I can pinpoint his contributions.  But he must be there for a reason.  God knows Dave and Adrian are enough for 99% of your guitar needs.  The songs?  They rule.  Especially the unbelievably awesome WICKER MAN.  The movie was cool and the song is cooler.  If this song doesn't make the remake's soundtrack, well, to hell with the filmmakers then.  The song just crushes.  So do BLOOD BROTHERS, BRAVE NEW WORLD, THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE.  But, really, every song is good and every bit of playing is just tremendous.  Welcome back, guys, you're just what the world of metal needed.
B000001DWG|3.0|Mother Love Bone was good, but nothing compared to Pearl Jam at all, Pearl Jam is 100 times better. Quit saying MLB is better just because theyre much less known and theyre your \\"hidden;secret;special\\" etc.. band, if MLB's first album was 'Ten', then Andy (with the voice of Eddie instead, died) and PJ's first album was 'Apple'... there would be about 5 times more people here saying MLB was better.    What a bunch of jerks, I'm here reading reviews & so many of you cant seem to compliment Andy Wood without insulting Eddie Vedder.. yeah range wise, Andy could sing some songs better than Eddie, but Andy couldnt of sung 'Jeremy' or 'Daughter' with as much power & emotion.    & don't get me started on Andys lyrics, for the most part, they were below average to be polite, whereas Eddie Vedder has written the greatest lyrics in music since Bob Dylan    And another thing...     Mother Love Bone sounded like an 80s band, its true.  They did NOT sound like a hair metal band, but they DID sound 80s...     Pearl Jam didnt sound 80s, Pearl Jam sounded new & fresh - If Andy didnt die & MLB stayed together, their music wouldve become insignificant because of the raw sound coming from Seattle, that Pearl Jam fit in with... MLB did not.  This is why MLB wouldve never been huge.  Times were changing.    Eddie knew that, Andy did not.
B00005Q45W|5.0|What can you say about Leonard Cohen that hasn't already been said?  He's probably one of the most revered and analyzed artists of the last thirty years.  He's written some of the greatest lyrics in pop history.  The guy just seems to get better and better.  Wow.  What an album.  Forget the production.  Get over it.  It's miminial.  That's the point.  The man is a minimalist now.  Waves of synth bass and the occasional key comes rolling in out of the black.  It's lovely.  The songs are beautiful.  Standouts?  They all are.  Okay, okay, the *real* standouts are IN MY SECRET LIFE, ALEXANDRA LEAVING and LOVE ITSELF.  IMSL is the best thing he's done as far as pop music goes since...well, I can't remember anything better.  Just amazing.  This guy is a master.  Buy it and turn yourself on to the unstoppable legend that is Leonard Cohen.  May he live to be a hundred and ten.

B000641ZA4|4.0|I really think that Genesis has to be one of the Greatest bands of all time. Now im only 18, So I dont recall any of there old videos. So this is why I picked it up. It has every song that I love and others that I never thought were videos. I never thought Illegal Alien had a music video. But the only thing about this dvd. theres no extra content on it. I also have to agree with ArmyVet, there is no sound effects in the Land of Confusion video. Now thats kind of a ripoff knowing that you've seen that video many of times in the 80's. And there were other videos that did pretty much the same thing. Why did Nick Davis do that?. Anyway, its a must buy for Genesis fans who want to remember the videos.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Let's all take a moment and try to remember (or forget) just how bad the last two Batman movies (\\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\") actually were. They were horrible. Neon Lights in Gotham?? Nipples on the bat suit?? Bat-cracks? Alicia Silverstone in a Batman movie? As Batgirl???? All this left the general movie-goers with a clear picture of what they thought comic books and the movie adaptions from them were all about, and it has haunted us true and loyal comic book fans for a long time.    Now think about the last few years, in particular the \\"Spider-Man\\" movies. They proved, finally, that hollywood can invest a ton of money, get a great ensemble cast and (cherish the thought) be faithful to the source material. The result? Two great movies (spidey).    Now comes \\"Batman Begins\\", and thank you very much it follows the story more than very well. It is dark, gritty, emotional and everything a Batman movie SHOULD be. But before we get Batman, we get Bruce Wayne and the movie is 100x better for it. We can't empathize with Wayne unless we see his journey, his struggles and his mistakes. And this film shows us all of that.    When the moment comes that Batman finally makes his appearance in the dark shadows of a Gotham dock, you almost have forgotten your watching a Batman film. The first hour or so focusing on Wayne and all the supporting characters (all amazingly well acted) is a great film in and of itself, and then we get an hour or so of Batman on top of it!    The film moves along well, and is just a great great flick. Fans of the comic walk away having seen there favorite caped crusader finally told right and told well (not to take away from Burton's two films, but they aren't even on the same level as this). And newcomers get an amazing story.    The Deluxe Edition DVD is definetly the way to go, as the single disc version has nothing, not even a trailer. This version, aside from a nifty comic book featuring three Bat-tales that inspired the script of themovie, has about a dozen featurettes ranging from 7-15 minutes on the script, the costume, the batmobile, stunts, etc. Also a great comic book interactive menu sits on the 2nd disc, which is really fun.    The sound and Picture quality are top notch, and this DVD is very Highly recommended!
B0000X2EOW|4.0|What can be said about this movie that has all ready not been said time and time again for many years?  I saw this movie when I was 7 and it did nothing but add to my then creative mind that was just growing. Labyrinth is what fantasy movies have forgotten how to be save for the recent string of Harry Potteer movies. This movie no matter how old you get is one you will find yourself watching again and again and finding that you cannot help but enjoy what Jim Henson and staff created. From the tunnels of the Ooglet to the Bog of Eternal Stench this movie had something waiting around every corner to keep you entertained time in and time out. This was a story that was well created the actors well versed and cast as well. David Bowie as the Goblin King Jareth was a character I often found myself mimicing for many years because he showed conflict that most good villians truly have. Torn between his affection for Sarah and just his own malice cause he likes to impose his will. The songs are as magical as the story itself and the characters are unforgettable. Share this movie with your kids share it with their kids and when your time has come place it in a time caspule and pray a new age of children get to enjoy it as well.
B0000024R8|4.0|I had this disk on vinyl many years ago and it was \\"ok\\" at the time. Now, 43 years later, it sounds much more interesting. There is an intensity in the songs you don't usually hear now.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This was a fantastic movie.     However, my reason for submitting this \\"review\\" is to voice my disgust and anger at so many of these 1-star sham reviews which contribute nothing but bigotted remarks and immature obscenities.     I have no problem if someone truly disliked this movie or any other movie, book, etc. What I do have a problem with are immature, emotionally-twisted kids who are bored with submitting reviews for angsty, black metal CDs and want to yank our chains here with hackeyed anti-Christian statements.    Get a life little boys. If you despise Christianity that is your right. But this is not the place for you. Nobody here needs or wants to put up with the same old blah-blah-blah about the Christian religion.    [...]
B000ASATWQ|4.0|It's hard not to compare all the Marley kids to Bob. They all have some very big shoes to fill. That said, if you're a fan of Bob and classic roots reggae, you're not going to find much to like on this disc. The production is good but the songwriting is sub-par and there's nothing to sink your teeth into other than a couple of catchy songs.<br /><br />I know, this is the new wave of reggae talent and by no means is Damian trying to be like Bob, but I'm just not buying into the hype. I mean the best song on the disc is a Bob Marley song (Pimper's Paradise) and it's not even sung by Damian. Stephen Marley, who in my opinion has always sounded the most like Bob, steels the show with his incredible sound. His rendition of Pimper's Paradise is worth 2 stars by itself. One of Bob's most beautiful songs shines here. He produces the disc so I have to assume Damian didn't have much to do with that track.<br /><br />Certainly not ground breaking and it feels as though its pieced together with various artists helping out, but an OK effort.<br />---------------<br />Revised Review -- Ok, I've had time to listen to this recording. I was a bit harsh on it when I first heard it. I have to say it took a while, but I've warmed up to it. I still think Stephen's hand is all over this record and his solo effort is superior to this. That said, there's a lot to like here and I hope Damian's next release show's more of Damian and sounds less of a collaberation. 3 1/2 Stars.
B000088E77|3.0|Fast and painless. <br /> <br />But ordered the newer edition of this cd with more songs and, I assume, better sound quality. Received the earlier, unremastered version without extra tracks, which was available elsewhere on Amazon for $4 less.

B000002H6C|5.0|Seriously,Metallica can never be better than this!Awesome thrash album to reaffirm that Metallica can't be beat.I mean,which other band can produce classics like Blackened,Harvester Of Sorrow and Dyers'Eve and mix them up with emotional classics like One and the best instrumental ever'To Live Is To Die'.Kirk Hammett's solos are mind blowing and Lars' drumming is really ambitious as a result of which it doesn't sound so great live in these songs now that he is in forties.James growls and sets his fretboard alight to perfection and Jason can't be heard, a sad tribute to the late Cliff Burton.This ranks as possibly the best album by any band in any genre of music ever!Get it now!
B0009QZ456|1.0|I'm surprised by some of the reactions to this CD. In truth, it is merely recycled R & B mixed in with a few amateurish high school songs. Gavin DeGraw is a white singer who's caught the public's fancy with his feigning hip persona, his blues-oriented voice and his contrived gospel mimicry. A closer look, however, reveals he's part and parcel of that familiar, commercially-sanitized version of this kind of music, pretending to be gritty but sounding untroublingly bland. Clive Davis discovered and promoted this guy which should tell you something. Outside of \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" (which just happens to be the theme song for one of those WB teen soaps), there's not only little else that is worth mentioning, there's simply nothing inventive- or even slightly exciting on this album (try to wade through some of the ballads without getting bored). The music has all been done before- a lot better and a lot more  genuinely. Those few appetizing bits and morsels that are occasionally thrown our way are clearly the result of the hand of a clever producer in the studio deftly weaving in a catchy intro here or a slick riff there.  Otherwise, this stuff is shallow. Presenting it in acoustic versions, an attempt no doubt to give it some integrity, makes it no more appealing or authentic. As for what passes for \\"lyrics,\\" sophomoric tripe such as \\"Girl, I think you're fine but I haven't got the time . . .\\" reminds us once again of that middle-teen mentality which embraces it.  Save your praise for someone/something else. This is lowest-common-denominator, purposely well-packaged pabulum for the under-aged or uninitiated mass market.  \\"Oh Char-eee-ot .  . .,\\" please! Take your driver and his wares and ride into the distance.
B00005MIZ5|3.0|After his debut recordings as a leader in 1947, it was quite a while until Thelonious Monk returned to the studio as a leader.  His next two sessions for Blue Note, in the summer of 1951 and spring of 1952 are collected as \\"Genius of Modern Music, Volume 2\\".  Although LP technology was available, Blue Note chose to keep Monk in the single format.<br /><br />The first session, from the summer of '51 finds Monk with perhaps the first frontline that truly \\"got\\" his music in alto saxophonist Sahib Shihab and vibist Milt Jackson, with bassist Al McKibbon and drummer Art Blakey anchoring the session.  With the exception of a reading of \\"Nice Work If You Can Get It\\" (which Monk curiously recorded for Blue Note in 1947 as well), all the pieces are Monk originals, and this level of focus benefits the band, whether it's the midtempo oddball \\"Criss Cross\\" (which works nicely with the odd frontline), ecstatic \\"Straight No Chaser\\" (which curiously flounders a bit on Shihab's solo), or piano feature \\"Ask Me Now\\", where Monk really shows just what he's capable of.<br /><br />The second session produces far less interesting music, with Monk accompanied by trumpeter Kenny Dorham, reedmen Lou Donaldson (on alto) and Lucky Thompson (on tenor), bassist Nelson Boyd and drummer Max Roach.  By and large, it feels as though the horns don't quite get into this as much they should and they seem to get in the way of each other.  \\"Skippy\\" is fantastic, full of energy and explosiveness, mid-tempo number \\"Let's Cool One\\" works reasonably well, but some of the material (\\"Sixteen\\", standards \\"Carolina Moon\\" and \\"I'll Follow You\\") receive straight and largely uninteresting reading.  This is most surprising on \\"I'll Follow You\\", which sheds the horns entirely and presents Monk in a trio setting.<br /><br />As part of the Rudy Van Gelder edition of remasters, this album features fantastic sound, given the age of the recording, far superior to the previous issue.<br /><br />There's enough good music on here to make this one worth digging up, but for interest in early Monk, start with Volume 1.music on here to make this one worth digging up, but for interest in early Monk, start with Volume 1.
B0009X766Y|5.0|Discerning fans of this great film will want to splurge on the \\"Legacy Series Edition\\" DVD.  The bonus features are fairly interesting, but probably not worth the upgrade (and certainly not worth a second disc!).  However, the film's rendering almost certainly is. <br /> <br />A lot has been said about the widescreen presentation.  I'll stay out of that debate, for the most part.  I much prefer widescreen presentations when available and this is no different.  But I can understand the argument of purists who take issue with an unauthorized reformatting of the late George Roy Hill's film. <br /> <br />That said, the transfer of this film on the Legacy Series DVD is simply gorgeous.  The colors are as sharp and bright as ever as is the soundtrack (yes, a DTS track is included!).  It far outpaces the older DVD release on both counts.  The cover and disc art are also vast improvements. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of \\"The Sting\\" -- and particularly if you're picky about A/V quality -- then I can't recommend this new release enough.
B00005R8DB|5.0|In 1956, Thelonious Monk was still not widely known.  Revered by musicians, his reputation with the public sat on a handful of compositions, a few sideman dates, a bunch of sides for Blue Note and a handful of albums.  It was into this that he recorded on his best, 1956's \\"Brilliant Corners\\".  His first album for Riverside to be by and large a feature for his compositions (only \\"I Surrender, Dear\\", a solo piano piece, is a standard, and you wouldn't know it by listening) recorded with a supportive band, this is Monk beginning to peak, and it shows. <br /> <br />One thing that's pretty clear throughout the album is many of the things that make Monk's music what it is-- the fractured rhythms, the bizarre harmonies, that dry swing he mastered.  Even the standard he performs is totally enveloped in his sound and concept.  The first three cuts feature a band with reedmen Ernie Henry (alto) and Sonny Rollins (tenor), bassist Oscar Pettiford, and drummer Max Roach.  From opener \\"Brilliant Corners\\", you can see the music is inspirational to the sidemen-- the odd harmony implies a third part, and both Rollins and Roach take remarkably powerful and lyrical solos.  The remainder of the session finds the leader in rare form, with a slow, patient and breathtaking solo on blues \\"Ba-Lue Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are\\". <br /> <br />And speaking of features for the leader, his arrangement of \\"I Surrender, Dear\\" is angular, exciting and extremely advanced, even for Monk.  The album closes on a slightly different note, the ecstatic and exciting \\"Bemsha Swing\\", with trumpeter Clark Terry and bassist Paul Chambers joining Rollins and Roach for what turns out to be a stunning performance. <br /> <br />This edition features breathtaking sound-- this remastering process clearly worked wonders, and includes the original liner notes essay. <br /> <br />As far as essential Monk goes, this piece is one of them, even for those who don't particularly care for Monk, this one is well worth the investment.Highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon is just a superb writer, pure and simple. I watched the series with no advance hype, and was just blown away by the great character development, ensemble work, and his penchant for paying tribute to the western and sci fi genres without ever giving in to their cliches... One feels for all these characters over time, and Whedon never loses his humor with them -- not taking it all too seriously makes the show even stronger. I'd recommend this series (and the movie) to anyone.
1400031354|4.0|The language is simple, the characters uncomplicated, the plot effortless, the morality is straightforward. It has an innocent naivety as if the story teller is narrating his tale to a child. The adults are addressed by titles and last names, which seems oddly formal in this dusty, sun-baked village in Botswana, but it becomes one more charming quality. Precious Ramotswe is assertive and independent. She takes pride in running her own detective agency and as a child might do simply names it \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.\\"  She also feels satisfaction in having as her secretary a woman who received a mark of 97 percent from the Botswana Secretarial College, a fact the reader is reminded of from time to time. One gets the impression from other characters that she is overweight, but she comfortably refers to herself as a \\"traditional woman.\\" I would love to sit down with her over a cup of bush tea in her home on Zebra Drive and have a conversation. She is absolutely endearing. Having read one other book in the series, I felt drawn to read another.
B000A0GP0Y|2.0|Very weak remake of the superior Burt Reyonolds football flick of the 1970's. By now it's a familiar tale of a bunch of criminal rejects that somehow are made to look better than the (as always) oppressive establishment. In this case it's the evil prison guards and the heartless warden. Adam Sandler is convincing in the title role and there are a couple of memorable performances. Especially Courtney Cox who nearly steals the movie in what is maybe a 10 minute total walk on appearance. Her new and improved body are housed in spectacular red dress that should have the men using their remote controls over and over again! But 10 minutes of beauty can't overcome a weak script and a tired plot and sad to say this movie has both of those things going against it. To put it into simple sports terms why watch an extra point movie when you can enjoy the original which is a six point touchdown! There's just no comparison. This one has a big red flag on the field. The referee is trying to tell us that this flick is definitely offside! Rent don't buy.
1401206905|5.0|Frank Miller opens this absolutely must own graphic novel classic from 1987-88 by telling us that if the only Batman we remember was Adam West on Saturday mornings, then we do not know the Batman he once met, a much darker batman, a more real batman, the kind of Batman that Tim Burton would succeed somewhat in bringing to the screen in 1989, but Batman: Year One is just so much better in so many ways, and probably will remain better than any movie or television program you can expect to see or have seen. If you want to know Batman, then you should really be meeting him right here.<br /><br />I especially like the Batman: Year one story. It is an excellent beginning, lots of in-jokes and capturing moments, even on-the-edge of the seat suspense, almost 100 pages of intense artwork. It is about the beginning of Batman like you have never seen it before, but also and probably more importantly, includes the beginning of Commissioner Gordon, a Lieutenant Gordon here, with a pregnant wife, who comes to Gotham City and finds his whole department on the take. The millionaire Bruce Wayne, has been training to become a vigilante since his parents where murdered by a gang of thieves. It is a psychological condition of revenge. He is trying to find the right formula to scare his victims. When he does, he goes up against the same criminals and kingpins that Lieutenant Gordon finds himself up against, no Jokers or Penguins here, but regular underworld types making it all the more level-headed, and thus a more accepting Batman and story. Batman fails in first few attempts, but manages miraculously to survive and continue on, both Gordon and Batman building their careers as crime fighters in Gotham City throughout the pages, a surprise bonus Catwoman introduced in the final act which sees the new crime-fighting duo of Batman and Gordon finally meeting up, without any sign of Robin among the 96 pages, this is certainly an alternative Batman and probably the best one. Miller's look is a murky color bleeding hard edges and smears, resulting in a Batman graphic novel that takes your breath away. The action sequences are better than any movie I can think off to date, your eyes go wide open from frame to frame as this is the kind of animate Batman you have always wanted to see in action.

B000002BMV|5.0|after steve perry joined journey in 1978, the band started a new chapter in their history book, starting with the album 'infinty'.  on through 'evolution', 'departure', and the live album 'captured', the boys racked up radio hit after hit, album smash after smash, and set concert venue attendance records everywhere.  which leads to 1981, where we find original keyboardist gregg rolie has left the group, and been replaced by former baby's keys man jonathan cain, and here we are with \\"escape\\", probably the most popular fm rock radio album of all time.  \\"escape\\" reached number 1 in august 1981, after the first single, 'who's crying now', peaked at 4 on the pop charts.  then came the all time rock anthem, 'don't stop believin'\\", which peaked at number 9 on the charts and forever became the theme song for sports championship teams all over america.  somewhere, in the cities of boston, new york, los angeles, houston, chicago, and other cities you can imagine, \\"don't stop believin'\\" is being blasted on somebody's radio, stereo system or bar jukebox.  take it from me, the song still gets me hype when i'm ready to rock out.  and then we have the 'piece de resistance' of the album, the all time number one power/rock/wedding ballad of all time: 'open arms'.  this is a song i refuse to remind you of, for you all out there know it by now:  soft, melodic piano from jonathan cain,  soothing vocals from the ever soulful steve perry, fantastic drum breaks from steve smith, and not to mention the great guitar and bass playing from the great neal schon and ross valory.  this song spent 6 weeks at number 2 on the pop charts, behind olivia newton-john's \\"physical\\", which had been at number 1 for 10(?) weeks.  after the success of open arms, the table was set for journey: sold out show after show, multiple nights in many cities including 6 sold out shows outside detroit , 4 shows in rosemont, illinois in may 1982, 5 l.a. forum shows, and many more which i will not take up any more of your reading time.  other songs on this album include the title track, which still gets played on recent tours, \\"keep on runnin\\", 'still they ride\\", 'mother, father', and another concert favorite, \\"stone in love\\".  well, there it is, the all time album that journey the premier rock album/concert act of the 80's.  it is a classic, and will be so for the decades to come.  p.s: for those who think that some of this stuff should be played in more intimate venues(theaters, clubs, etc.), let me tell you something:  hockey arenas and footbal/baseball stadiums were as intimate as journey got back in the old days. and one more thing before i go:  who in the hell is this limp bizkit jackleg fool?  after reading that review of his, i wanted to find some other journey fans, gather together, and beat the crap out of that dude who is so far behind in his knowledge, or whatever knowledge he thought he had.  this was rock circa 1981/82, not 1998/99!  get with it, you damn fool!  and hey, while journey is still packin' the arenas and amphitheatres across america this past summer as part of their 30th anniversary tour, where in the world are your beloved limp bizkit boys, huh?r reading time.  other songs on this album include the title track, which still gets played on recent tours, \\"keep on runnin\\", 'still they ride\\", 'mother, father', and another concert favorite, \\"stone in love\\".  well, there it is, the all time album that journey the premier rock album/concert act of the 80's.  it is a classic, and will be so for the decades to come.  p.s: for those who think that some of this stuff should be played in more intimate venues(theaters, clubs, etc.), let me tell you something:  hockey arenas and footbal/baseball stadiums were as intimate as journey got back in the old days. and one more thing before i go:  who in the hell is this limp bizkit jackleg fool?  after reading that review of his, i wanted to find some other journey fans, gather together, and beat the crap out of that dude who is so far behind in his knowledge, or whatever knowledge he thought he had.  this was rock circa 1981/82, not 1998/99!  get with it, you damn fool!  and hey, while journey is still packin' the arenas and amphitheatres across america this past summer as part of their 30th anniversary tour, where in the world are your beloved limp bizkit boys, huh?
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|Seeing this film as a teenager, I was confused by its somewhat erratic pace and strange characterizations.  The scene with the Yardbirds was the epitome of 60's nonchalance- and perhaps Antonioni's vision. what does it matter- I fought for it(the guitar neck) but so what. The entire film deals with our perception of the reality we know.  It's here, or is it? The photography scenes are laughable- anyone who has enlarged a negative will agree, I think. The final scene has a closure which works for the film- but it left me with a feeling of being conned-maybe intended.
0743454529|4.0|brilliantly written.  The constant swapping between scenes kept me riveted to the the very end.  The end was somewhat disappointing , as we all hope for a happy ending (sorry to those who are yet to experience it!!) and it certainly had me thinking about how difficult life must have been for poor Anna. Alot of the times you can almost put yourself in her position and can feel the emotion that she felt.again about the ending all you can really say i guess is \\"isnt it Ironic?\\".i cetainly will be looking forward to reading more of Jodies work.
B00006ZSAD|5.0|In my humble opinion, most of the reviewers below, by focussing on the stylistic aspects of Beth Gibbons' new album, have completely missed the point.  Let me add also that I'm one of Portishead's most rabid fans, and that I consider their almost impossible to find \\"Trip Hop Reconstruction\\" (differently titled depending on the country of origin--mine's Australian) to be one of the greatest albums ever--along with Dummy, Portishead and Roseland of course.  But maybe albums like \\"Out of Season\\" should be reviewed both by normal people who can critique them effectively on their purely stylistic attributes, and those who are \\"damaged\\" in some way, and who can therefore critique something like this on a more general aesthetic level.  Because this album bears comparison with the greatest musical art in western civilization that seeks to encompass the emotions of loneliness, alienation desolation and despair.  I'm serious.  I recently compared it to Brigit Fassbaender's Schubert \\"Winterreise,\\" Shostakovich's 14th Symphony, the \\"Abscheid\\" from Mahler's \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\" and Moussorgsky's great \\"Sunless\\" and \\"Songs and Dances of Death\\" cycles.  That's about as good as it gets, and this magnificent album easily belongs in that \\"elite\\" company.  The songs range from excellent to unbelievable as do Paul Webb's haunting arrangements and accompaniments.  But it's Gibbons vocal performance that elevates this into the realm of high, serious art.  I've never heard a singer (I'm speaking here solely about the perforance rather than the material) who is able to convey the meaning and essence of what if feels like to be completely, hopelessly isolated from the world.  This isn't solitude, it's bleak, stark loneliness.<br /><br />Lucky for them, most people don't get it.  For example, one of the reviewers below describes the dreamy atmosphere of \\"Sand River\\" and quotes the lines \\"Beauty has a hold on me; Autumn leaves, pretty as can be.\\"  But the emotional center of the song is in the next two lines, when Gibbons virtually sobs out \\"Everyone can see, everyone except me.\\"  Try to imagine what it feels like when even beauty leaves you behind.  Listening to Beth Gibbons will help, if you want to give it a try.  I've never heard a vocal performance like this. Gibbon's can float a beautiful note better than just about anyone when she wants to, and when she does so on this album--taken in context--it will tear your heart out.  When beauty takes a back seat to truth, as it often must on a work like this, I find myself wondering how someone can get so close to the edge without losing it and falling off.  Subtle changes in inflexion, the emphasis she places on certain words, the way she adopts a slightly different tone to suit the mood of each song remind me of what separates something like Maxim Vengerov's shattering performance of Shostakovich's 1st Violin concerto, which literally makes all prior and subsequent recordings of the work superfluous, from other, merely competent performances.  You can't describe it without doing it a disservice; this is the truly the kind of music-making that begins where mere words lose their ability to adequately convey the intent of the communicator.<br /><br />So this album is for everyone who's ever stuck a needle in their arm on a slate gray Sunday afternoon in a filthy flat in some rotten city, who's ever made a serious attempt at drinking themselves to death, who's ever known that \\"died of a broken heart\\" can be more than just a metaphor, who has gone a month without even a call from a telephone solicitor, who has ever forgotten how to talk because they've gone so long without speaking to another person, who has loved so hard what they can never love again that they wished they had never loved at all.  Each song, in its own way, is like a suicide note from the edge of the abyss, except perhaps for \\"Rustin Man\\" which sounds as much like a love song from beyond the grave as you're ever likely to hear.  This is not music to make your martini slide down easier, or to use as a soundtrack to your next sexual conquest.  It's not easy to listen to, and it might just ruin your day.  But make no mistake about it, this is one of the greatest vocal recordings ever made.his is not music to make your martini slide down easier, or to use as a soundtrack to your next sexual conquest.

B00005JO0J|5.0|Great movie. Those who carp about the technical details; the plotting; the effects; etc. are just wrong. Sorry, folks.<br /><br />I wanted, however, to comment re: the one reviewer who trashed the film because of its message. Golly. How horrible that a movie exists that actually believes each of us owns our own lives! Wow. That each of us should decide for ourselves how those lives should be lived. Gee. That rejects the social-engineering that is the hallmark of today's world.<br /><br />I suspect that the vast majority of those who reject this movie are those who support collectivism and statism, who think they have the right to force others to live as _they_ want them to live, who run in terror from anything that smacks of real freedom, real rights, real morality, real heroes.<br /><br />Such people deserve each other.<br /><br />Go see this movie.
B00004RITP|4.0|Mining the notebooks of deceased composers for unpublished and nearly completed works has a long and venerable tradition.  Brahms edited works by Franz Schubert and others completed works by Mozart including his famous \\"Requiem\\".  Every now and again a new work is uncovered in some library and the world is hungry to hear any scrap of new music from these favorite composers.  Doesn't this say something about the quantity and quality of new music?  In their time, there was so much other music being written, and its expected life was so short, that no one cared a bit about \\"lost\\" compositions.  There was simply too much music competing for the stage for it all to be heard.<br /><br />Despite this disk being entitled Mahler's 10th Symphony, there is no such thing.  Mahler's compositional process was such that he worked out a complete notebook of a symphony during his summers and worked out the final versions, often substantially revised, during his winters.  However, during his last year, he spent a great deal of time preparing his ninth symphony rather than working on this piece.  What we have here is the notebook draft of what would have become the 10th symphony had Mahler lived.  It is a largely complete draft and was put into performable shape by others.  Four names are provided on this label, but principle credit is given to Deryck Cooke.<br /><br />So, what do we have here?  It is a long elegiac piece that emphasizes strings.  I am not convinced the winds would have been as suppressed as they are here, but we have what we have.  The gestures and effects are all Mahlerian.  If you heard this and were not told the composer, you would immediately know whose work it is.  Or maybe, since you would not know the work, suppose it was someone imitating Mahler.  There are some gorgeous moments, some incredibly poetic moments (the amazing ending to the first movement), and some wonderfully howling chords that are somewhat surprising.<br /><br />If you don't know Mahler's music, start somewhere else.  The first and second symphonies continue to be favorites and easily accessible.  His music is clearly tonal, but highly chromatic (it slips from key to key easily and has many inflected chords).  Some people refer to this music has late late Romantic, others see the budding of atonality.  I personally hear this as 11:57 pm on the clock of Romanticism.<br /><br />This recording is well done, poetically performed, and sensitively conducted by Simon Rattle.  He is able to architect the whole work into a whole that makes sense and every moment is connected to all the others.  Still, this is a work that is more for devotees of Mahler who want one more piece than for the general public.  For them, there is a lot to hear before they need to spend time with performances of notebooks of uncompleted works, however beautiful individual moments might be.se.

B000001DQG|5.0|Elton John and Bernie Taupin were a genius songwriting collaboration 'made in heaven'.  Like Lennon and McCartney, Difford and Tilbrook, so go these masters.  There is a little bit of everything for everyone on this awesomely creative release, and all the songs are rather well written and catchy.  Straight ahead rockers, love songs, country tinged, broadway operatic, etc. This is quintessential Elton John, and the CD remaster is pure aural bliss!  Long live the 70's!

I learned that no matter what color of skin someone is they are still people and it matters who they are inside.

B00005JNQS|4.0|Robots!!  Well if you havent seen the movie yet and are a fan of this style of movie at all, then I reccomend watching it.  Sure, its not Finding Nemo, or The Incredibles, but it is a very entertaining show.<br /><br />Basically the plot goes like this:  A new baby (Rodney Copperbottom) is born (well assembled anyway) and he grows up in poverty; His father is a dishwasher at a local resturaunt. Rodney's family love him and raise him with lots of love and affection.  He grows up and sees that his father is doing all he can to give Rodney a good upbringing.  Then as Rodney is growing up, he is inspired to become an inventor by watching a television show called the Big Weld Show.  Rodney grows up learning to invent and when he finally moves out of the house he decides to show an invention of his to Mr. Big Weld in the hopes that he will land a good job and then help his Father get out of his situation and have a better life.  What Rodney finds out is That Big Weld industries is being run by an evil Money monger and Mr. Big Weld has gone into a forced retirement.  Rodney meets up with some really funny Robots and his adventure begins.  Eventually, the movie has a happy ending and Rodney saves the day.<br /><br />Yes the movie is a bit predictable, but hey, arent they all really??  We usually like to have a happy ending with a hero winning and a villian getting what is due.<br /><br />I read other reviews that say the fact that they are Robots, they had a hard time relating to the show, but in my opinion, the voice acting was done very well and I never had a problem relating to any of it.  All in all, its not my most favorite movie, but I will buy it to add to my collection cause it was a fun and origional movie.  The older I get the harder it seems that hollywood can think up anything origional anymore, but they keep surprising me!<br /><br />Worth watching at least once with your family, I recommend it!
B0001XAS1W|5.0|I bought the original album back in 1977, on the strengh of the title song and On the border. But boy, I did not know the rest of the tracks were that strong! This is Al Stewart artistic (and commercial) peak. Put together a talented singer/songwriter (at the heigh of his inspiration), a fantastic back up band with only top notch musicians, tasteful arrangements and, to top it all, a Grammy awarded producer. What do you have? The Year Of the Cat! Al has always write great songs, but this time he really mastered his skills. He could be a fantastic poet or novel writer, but he still has the hability to deliver his words with fine melodies to back them up. <br /> <br />When I found the CD version on the market I had to have it and remember why I heard the original vinyl album until it wore out. I really love Modern Times and Time Passges, as well as the other  albums he made before and after this one, but The Year Of the Cat is still his best, period. A truly masterpiece. It deserved all the success it had. wish other such great albums had the same fate...

B000AL730O|4.0|As someone who is a songwriter and musician by trade and a Beatle fan since 1963 I have been moved by this current release.I hadn`t bought an album of Pauls since his 1st in 1970.I began hearing blurbs about the new CD so I decided to go to his website.After streaming the audio to \\"Fine Line\\" I had a strange feeling that this release would be the one to pull me back in to the world of Sir Paul.I decided to download a few tracks and at that point I was commited to buy the CD...The actual songwriting on this recording is so advanced harmonically and so advanced in the use of melody that you finally can see the role Paul played in the collaboration with John.The songs have an effect of wanting to be played many times over.I`ve played the CD no less than 8 times in the last 4 days....If I sound like this is a perfect CD,I`m sorry to report that it`s not.The problem is the standard that was set by 1970 (after the Beatles split)is so high that no mere mortal could ever surpass what was done...Even if it is Mr. McCartney himself...Having said that,The music on this CD has brought tears to my eyes, not just over the sentimental aspect of a former Beatle continuing to write great music,but as a childhood hero who has seen a rebirth.Like an actor who \\"stretches\\"in a role for a new film,Paulie has once again showed us that he`s not just the \\"Silly Love Song\\"guy.His experiments with classical music,electronic as well as different ethnic and other styles have given him a platform to finish his career with a bang....I even went on Ebay and bought 2 tickets to the Oct. 4th Madison Square Garden concert....I plan on wearing sunglasses to hide the tears I`ll shed on that night....Long live Paul and the memory of his former bandmates!!!   A final note to music types...There are so many unexpected turns on the CD.He`ll go to a minor key just when your expecting major...His use of deceptive cadence is all over this record...(sorry for the technical jargon but I`m a musician dammit!!)
B000A0GP0Y|1.0|A remake, such as this one, begs to be compared to the original. If that's the case, this is one awful movie. Adam Sandler is completely mis-cast as the character Paul Crew. I didn't believe he was an ex-NFL quarterback for one minute and his pedestrian effort throughout the entire movie did nothing to try to convince me otherwise. Even Burt Reynolds (who was excellent in the original) seemed lost as to what the director was trying to convey. Chris Rock could have been more memorable in the role of Caretaker but the director made poor use of his talents. <br />If you enjoy huge, sweaty, steroid infested non-actors mugging and growling and screaming in front of a camera, this may be a movie for you. I prefer a compelling story mixed with a bit of a message, which was present in the original movie. The only message in this version was,\\"Look, we got Adam Sandler and Chris Rock in the same movie, isn't it hilarious?\\"  NO, it isn't.
B000ASSDVA|5.0|Director Anthony Mann specialized in intelligence action films (see his early film noir work or his '50s westerns for comparison), so he proved an excellent choice for bring the story of Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar (better known as El Cid) to the screen in all its widescreen glory.  Mann didn't invent the epic, but with 'El Cid,' he took it to heights it had rarely reached before and has rarely attained since. An astonishing achievement for its era, the passage of time has done little to diminish its scale or its power -- indeed it seems, in a curious way, to have gained in stature, in dignity, and in sheer, blissful watchability. <br /> <br />Heston was never better than this. Nor was Loren. And as for those closing seconds, whilst intimations of legend take wing upon the thunderous organ coda of one of composer Miklos Rosza's finest scores, one becomes impressed at how something with this kind of scale has been brought off.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, scriptwriter Jordan never could script a believeable love scene, but don't let that put you off the genuine pleasures offered herein.

Kristen Chenoweth has the kind of soprano that would be appreciated at the Metropolitan Opera, yet is so very easy to understand when she is doing \\"show\\" music like this.  Their second act duet is beautiful, while their first act encounters are hysterical, even on disk.  If you haven't seen the show, buy the disk!  If you have seen the show, buy the disk!

B00005JO0J|5.0|This is a great movie for Firefly fans and is still pretty good for those who don't know & love the crew the way the Browncoats do!  The complex characters and interesting dialog that made the series great are expertly recreated in the movie thanks to Joss Whedon's focus on the acting over special effects.  While Mal and River are the main characters in the film the others do get a chance to shine, although I would have liked to see more of the lovely Inara.  Jayne did get some classic Firefly lines (\\"gee, wouldn't it be nice to have some grenades right about now!\\", \\"you can never have enough guns\\")that helped liven things up.  This movie was worth seeing and hopefully will lead to another movie or maybe a return of the series, although that will be hard to accomplish all things considered...
B00080ZG10|4.0|I was warned that this movie was long and slow and boring and that I would hate it.  So I just yesterday rented it and watched it during the day to avoid getting too tired and I watched and I enjoyed, emensly.  This film is a great biopic standing tall with films like 'A Beautiful Mind' or 'The Insider'.  Leo does an amazing job portraying Hughes or so I've heard.  It's hard to judge the acting on this film form my perspective because I am too young to know how these people really were like, but I hear it's spot on, I mean with the oscar nods and Blanchett's win as Miss Hepburn you know the acting is up there.  I personally enjoy watching John C. Reilly act.  His portrayal of Noah Dietrich was great.  He just has a great presence.  The cameos by Stefani who played Jean Harlow and Jude Law who played Errol Flynn were great and the ever beautiful Kate Beckinsale in her performance as Ava Gardner was amazing.  Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda play the perfect villians and Alda (Senator Brewster) deserved that oscar.  I've never been a MASH fan but he nailed his performance here.  The court room scenes were my favorite in the film.  I do want to say that acting aside the direction this film took was better than say Ray took this year.  I felt that Scorsese did wonders with this movie, making everything feel like you were right there.  The sets were beautiful the colors were vibrant and the script was very well done.  This is a great movie and I'd recomend it to anyone with an interest in history, aviation, the art of movie making or someone who just wants to be entertained...this is your movie.

B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is said to be the best Beatle album by many people, all over the world. Not only that, but I believe it holds out for one of the best ablums of any band ever. Although Let It Be was the last released Beatle album, Abbey Road was the last recorded. Here is a breakdown of the Fab Four's farewell album.         It starts off with John's rocking Come Together, huge cult hit. One of the most original songs ever. It takes a creative mind like that of John Lennon to compose such a unique song. Something is a Harrison classic. The perfect love song. It's such a simple, easy song to listen to. Maxwell's Silver Hamer is deffinetly no the best song on the album. Not bad, but a bit childish for my tastes. Oh! Darling, a great love song like Something. Booming Bass. Octopuss's Garden is Ringo's song from the album. It sounds a bit country, especially the opening riff. I In my opinion, its a slower song, similar to What Goes On, Ringo's song from Rubber Soul, which also sounds very country. I Want You (She's So Heavy). I dont like this one a whole lot. To long and weird. Here Comes The Sun may be the best song on the album. Beautiful acoustic piece from Harrison. Because, the eigth song is a darker feeling song, with pretty much the same opening as I Want You (She's So Heavy), except higher. You Never Give Me Your Money, is very underated. It starts off slow and piano based with Paul singing, then it speeds it up and starts a new part of the piece. It's an amazing song. Sun King, sort of boring. Mean Mr. Mustard, probably my least favorite song on Abbey Road. Polythene Pam, a great rock song. She Came In Through The Bathroom Window. Short, but still ok. Golden Slumbers, the fourteenth song. A slower, more mature song. A song only for a mature teenager, or an adult. Carry That Weight. This song has a very cool singing style. It's all sort of sychronized, melodic, yelling. Very nice. The End is a masterpiece, that should be at the end of the album. It's the song with that legendary line. \\"In The End. The love you take, is equal, to the love you make.\\" Great ending for a song. Her Majesty, pretty, short song, but should not have been the closing song. That should have been The End.         Abbey Road is essential for any Beatles fan obviously, but if your a kid, and you just pretend to like The Bealtes because they were so huge, then you dont deserve this album. People like that wouldn't enjoy it anyway. This album for more of a mature audience. Farewell Beatles. The End.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Imagine a television universe with action, mystery, suspense and characters with actual dimension. Now, imagine that the show was a commercial success. Sadly, only one of those two sentences can be true.  <br /> <br />With Firefly, Joss Whedon pulled a sci-fi trick out of his writing hat, and in the process gave us a new group of fascinating characters to care about. With his customarily sharp wit, Whedon delivered arguably the best dialog in television, and laid out a new Anglo-Sino dialect peppered with wild-west accents. Chinese and \\"awww-shucks\\" english blended seemlessly together, all the time cracking wise to crack us up and turning effortlessly poetic to break the heart. For the first time in a very, very, very long time, we get a captivating brave new world of not-so-good-good-guys and lots and lots of secrets. <br /> <br />It all added up to a formula of sci-fi that was not self-important, formal, serious or hygenic to the point of sterility. It was a used, lived-in universe that bore all the markings of having people in it. It was space opera meets shoot-em-up-western, and it was the best thing to happen to television, even if it only lasted an all too brief moment. If you like good old-fashioned storytelling, this is your show.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|... like the Tinker's Coin from Jack Hardy's songbook. In any case, Young has come up with a brilliant CD. And it's simplicity is its calling card. These are songs about a marriage, about a father's dementia, about what was sacred in a family setting, about the way Music invokes a special relationship, and the songs are delivered with an authenticity that sometimes is disarming.  <br />All of it works. And that's remarkable for a Neil Young record. Perhaps his own brush with potential catastrophe sharpened his focus. This IS a focused CD. There is only what is necessary for the song herein. Emmylou Harris once again delivers such a perfectly complementary touch to Young's songs that it's a wonder they don't work together as closely as she did with Gram Parsons. Ben Keith, Spooner Oldham lead the band through their paces. The gospel choir is understated. This is a document for the ages. Having riffed through more incendiary rockers than any of his contemporaries, Young has found via Hank Williams' guitar an instrument to take him places. Much like Metheny with his baritone guitar on ONE QUIET NIGHT, Young here plays with something so close to ineffable grace that you wonder if the guitar isn't in some way playing him. <br />He alludes to as much in the paean to the instrument. And that's key to the whole album: it's Life living through us. We need to be reminded of that every so often. Young does so with a compassion and a rootedness that comes with having grown up among family on the Canadian prairie.. He brings the album to a beautiful conclusion with \\"When God Made Me.\\" It is a simple church hymn that lays out the importance of what Abraham Lincoln said: \\"I pray not that God is on our side, but that we are on God's side.\\" Young's spiritual is a hymn for understanding and tolerance, not something you hear often in the Bush-Cheney Berchtesgarten.  <br />The Cd also includes one of the most important songs Young has ever written: \\"No Wonder\\" . In it Young has developed a parable for the world as it is now and it is at least the equivalent of Dylan's \\"All Along The Watchtower,\\" or \\"Idiot Wind.\\" Even the title portends more than you realize: when you consider that Thales, the father of philosophy, said thinking was born of wonder, then the prospect of a culture that would restrict wonder, martial the way you think, curtail your freedom in service to an ideology, well, then quite literally no wonder is exactly what they have on the menu. Wonder leads to Thinking and that can be dangerous to those who only believe. For my 2 quid, this is the most profound Young song ever. <br />The DVD version of the studio sessions is brilliant. Young forgets to lip-sync a couple of times, but no matter, the way the image takes so long to fade to complete black is entirely the point to \\"Prairie Wind,\\" Young's homage to his father and his descent into dementia. There are a lot of ghosts throughout this record. That long fade concludes \\"When God Made Me\\" as well and it packs an emotional whallop akin to his minimalist rendering of \\"Philadelphia\\" from the Demme film. It is so spare that it haunts you. <br />Young has called this a rumination on what's important. Well aye.
B00005JO0J|5.0|My husband and I saw Serenity this weekend. It was terrific. I think that if you have followed the TV series you'll, of course, have a better understanding and connection to each of the characters. But even if you don't have a clue, this  movie absolutely stands on it's own merit.<br /><br />I've always like how Joss Whedon mixes the serious with a dash of humour when you least expect it.<br /><br />I'm sure you'll love this movie as much as we did. I hope this is the beginning of another new season on TV and movie sequel. Hey, why not wish for both.
0743487478|5.0|I was compelled to write a review for the first time on Amazon after being so shocked to see the negative reviews for this marvelous book. Alphie Kohn is the first (that I know of) to put not only himself as a parent but also the whole body of parenting advice literature in a critical light. His own humble advice is simple and logical but, at the same time, nothing less than earth-shattering. It puts the whole concept of parenting under the microscope and makes us ask ourselves whether our ideas are ethical, or even practical. I have now seen my children blossom under the respect I have been able to give them after reading this book without fear of losing my \\"authority.\\" I found that my children are even more able to show me the respect I need as a mother and a person, when they are being respected themselves. This means taking their needs and feelings seriously, as seriously as we take our friend's or spouse's needs. What a simple concept, but oh so threatening to most of us who are deeply afraid of those shopping-mall tantrums and bad reports from teachers. It takes a lot of courage for parents to shut out the rest of the world, with its judgements and expectations, and relate directly with the small, but equally valuable, person that is our child. What scares so many parents is the idea of losing control, and this fear comes through in negative reviews. What a sad reflection on us as \\"big people\\" and as a civilized society, where everyone, except of course the young, have equal rights for respect, dignity and freedom.

0399152717|3.0|Really not much here.  Passable entertainment for the plain or beach but you can certainly do better.  I have heard good things about Cussler, but I was not impressed.  The characters were all one deminsional and the action and plot was comic book at best.  He has been writing for a long time and maybe I should read some of his older stuff, a lot of mega selling writers get lazy after so much success.  I also noted this book was co-authored.  Is this Like James Patterson who has others write books and then he adds his name as the coauthor?
B00005LC1H|5.0|Lots of very visual humour. Show translated and shown in about 80 different countries. Best $50 you can spend on a DVD. As good as it gets. I watch episodes over and over again and they are just as funny as the first time.
0790729377|3.0|There are three reasons for watching \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\": Brando. Brando. Brando. <br /> <br />Marlon Brando's bestial heat still flares off that black and white celluloid like the flashpots from the third row of a KISS concert. It is obvious why his work in this movie has been lauded, critiqued, dissected, imitated, codified and ultimately iconicized - it's absolutely astounding! To this day, few have captured that feral rawness and \\"natural-ness\\" that he exuded; an actor boldly pioneering a new style, a bravura \\"Method\\". The screen becomes all too two-dimensional when he is not onscreen. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Vivien Leigh's acting style, though lauded by film aficionados as a symbiotic, diametric marriage of intensity with Brando's, is just plain hard to watch and truthfully quite embarrassing at points.  <br /> <br />For modern viewers, she cannot seem to \\"convince\\" with her old-school \\"presentational\\" style, clashing irreconcilably with Brando's \\"method\\".  <br /> <br />The icy romance between Leigh and Karl Malden's character only serves to pound home the truth that sexual mores have moved too far from filmic 50s etiquette, to be in any way considered vital or even interesting to modern viewers, even though, for its day, much censorship was brought down upon \\"Streetcar\\". So we are left with an inordinate amount of yapping that Leigh inflicts on Malden; enough to make any man turn to drink, drugs, other women, other men, football, synchronized swimming or forsaking humanity and leaving for outer space like Chuck Heston in \\"Planet Of The Apes\\".  <br /> <br />During Leigh's incessant rambles, strewn passim to illustrate her neuroticism, one continually wonders whether one is missing innuendo which was considered innuendo Back Then but which is now simply naivete, or whether there was any innuendo courted at all and it was as innocent and puling as it sounded. Ultimately, it is too taxing to pretend filmic sophistication and dissect character motivation - on a pure enjoyment level, Leigh delivers only to historians and Serious Critics. <br /> <br />Surely, 'The Play's The Thing' and the story is as vital now as it was then (that of the estranged sister - Leigh - with the profligate and promiscuous past attempting to excise her demons by immersing herself in a new life with her sister and brother-in-law - Kim Hunter and Brando), but the manner in which this tale is purveyed has dated, the only vital remaining aspect being Brando. Brando. Brando. <br />
B0000A02TZ|5.0|How does one review a movie such as this?  This obscene, ludicrous, piece of fine entertainment!  National Lampoon and Caddyshack fans come together and purchase this film which should already be in your collection!  What are you waiting for?
B00005JKN9|5.0|There are three reasons to watch Martin Scorcese's superlative \\"Gangs Of New York\\": <br /> <br />Daniel. <br />Day. <br />Lewis. <br /> <br />Over the years, in his diversity of roles, Day-Lewis has insidiously placed himself amongst an elite few who have the right to actually term themselves Actors in this \\"excrementitious\\" business which has degenerated into a forum for \\"movie stars\\" (people with correct hair and *au courant* clothes designers). <br /> <br />In a film stocked with excellent actors, Day-Lewis (no doubt, through the assistance and vision of director Martin Scorcese) molds a larger-than-history persona that illustrates the fact that Acting isn't really as easy as we all think it is. We are shown - by an absolute MASTER of the craft - how it's REALLY done: the force of will to forge this unique embodiment of power; abrasive, ambitious, ruthless, loyal; the choices of movement, accent, attire; each inflection, each flourish - Grand Gesture - not a smirk out of place, not a twirl of the moustache unintentional.  <br /> <br />This movie's plot is almost an afterthought: set against the cyclorama of political machinations which defined early New York City's cultural eclecticism, an iron-fisted tyrant (Day-Lewis as Bill Cutting) must deal with crooked politicians (are there any other type?) threatening to usurp his power over a swathe of borough known as the Five Points, as well as deal with Leonardo DiCaprio (playing the son of a former civil leader whom Bill executed personally in a street battle), seeking vengeance for his father's death.  <br /> <br />Were it not for Daniel Day-Lewis, \\"Gangs of New York\\" would be merely a \\"great\\" film, scourged from the engine-pit of misbegotten pseudo-history and sand-blasted ocher-tinged onto the epic screen - but with Day-Lewis' incendiary performance of Bill Cutting, this film rightfully earns the mantle of \\"classic\\". <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|Normally movies based on best-selling literature are \\"edited\\" to be more \\"interesting\\" to the general public. I love the book Pride and Prejudice, and this movie did not let me down.  There are a few things that may deter some from watching, the movie is six hours long, but for anyone who loves the book this movie should be just as well loved.
B000000WFZ|5.0|This soundtrack is memorable. The music and voices are beautiful. One of the best.
0385720920|2.0|When I pick out a book, I don't read the back.  I read the first couple of pages to see if I like the writing style.<br /><br />I should have been paying more attention to the words.  He came right out on page one and told me I wouldn't like this book and I took it as a dare more than a warning.  Should have read the warning.<br /><br />The writing style kept me turning pages but I was uncomfortable with the subject matter.  The vulgarity of the main character's sexual addiction, the sheer lunacy of every other character and something about the casts struggle with starvation made me feel like the book was my own manic episode.<br /><br />This book marks the closest I've ever come to not finishing a novel.  It would take a lot to make me pick up another of Chuck's books.
0425163407|4.0|Great book - entire series is very good.  Would definitely recommend for a great mystery read.
B000088E6D|2.0|Yeah, I too, have to agree, that this guy is a good singer- good at imitating Frank Sinatra. He doesnt have his own voice.  <br />Nora Jones has her own voice. Dolly Parton has her own voice. Randy Travis has his own voice. Not this guy. These songs have a very schmaltzy feel to them. But, I must say it is relaxing. The guy does have talent. But I would like to hear him try something that is a reflection of his own personality.

044024157X|2.0|I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting, but it kept deviating away from the story and introduced way too many characters, that in my opinion, had little or nothing to do with the story.  It's almost as if this was a short story stretched into novel length.  Either that or the author was under a deadline to crank the next book out and this is the result.  Still overall it wasn't terrible, but still not one of his best works, that's for certain.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|i am not exactly hardcore. but i loved ff7. <br /> <br />as for the movie. the story was very underdeveloped and at times made no sense. and yes there were very unrealistic and ridiculous fight sequences. but ff7 is not very realistic to begin with anyway. IT'S BASED OFF A GAME. you shouldn't expect anything more from that. or anything less rather. it's like saying: \\"magic doesn't belong in this ff7. it's too unrealistic.\\" give me a break. it's people like these that ruin a game or movie for themselves that they grew up loving. sure the fight scenes were very unrealistic. but can't you ff7 fans just look past all that reality bs so that you can actually ENJOY the movie? <br /> <br />and to those people who thought ff7ac should have been a theater release: no it should not have been released in theaters. it would turn into another spirits within. hardcore ff fans watch it the first week or two. then the ticket sales just die after that. the failure of spirits within is the MAIN reason why we ff7 fans have waited so long for an ff7 game sequel which is currently in the works. there just aren't enough ff fans in the usa to make up for all the money that could have been spent to bring this movie to the widescreen. <br /> <br />but i DID like the movie. i loved the action, loved the animation(absolutely loved sephiroth). i think they did a great job catering to the hardcore ff7 fans. <br /> <br />but seriously. you really have to how you say..have high expectations about this movie to like it. or be a very optimistic person. if you are planning not to expect much from this you probably will see all the little faults of this movie and automatically hate it. i would know. my brother expected little out of this movie. and he ended up hating it. funny thing is; he was the one who got me into the game in the first place. haha. <br /> <br />i expected a lot. and i was rewarded greatly for it. minus the story. once again i will admit that the story was very poorly done. but i did understand it. so i am a satisfied customer and i WILL buy it when it is released in the USA.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Sin City is, perhaps, one of the worst films of the year. I was amazed to discover that others found the so-called \\"story lines\\" compelling, for I was left utterly disinterested. In fact, I barely made it through the movie with my sanity intact. I am less amazed at those who found it to be visually compelling. But the visual interest is quite buried beneath a wealth of pointless violence and a truly horrendous script. I would give it zero stars if it were allowable!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have to say that I find it amusing when people equate George Lucas's fixing shots that he never figured out how to do for the original trilogy (erasing the orange smudge that hid the wheels under Luke's speeder, replacing Jabba the Hutt with a digital character so he matched with Return of the Jedi, etc.) with sacrificing story telling for visual effects.

B00005JOGU|5.0|Director Bennett Miller has done a terrific job of creating a deep sense of foreboding and impending doom in his re-telling of the story of Truman Capote (Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a tour-de-force performance) and his relationship with the convicted Clutter family murderers, Perry Smith (an intense Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino).<br /><br />Be forewarned though, \\"Capote\\" is not a filmic love letter to Truman Capote and his Jet Set cronies. This is a blunt, peeling away of the glamour that was the Capote persona and what Bennett comes up with is not pleasant...but it is honest and straightforward and for this Bennett is to be congratulated.<br /><br />Hoffman, as opposed to say Charlize Theron's quasi-performance in \\"Monster,\\" not only takes on the manner and physical attributes of Capote but he also inhabits and reveals the heart (hard) and soul (decayed) of the man responsible for the breath-taking, \\"In Cold Blood.\\" But at what price to all involved: Smith, Hickock, FBI agent Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), close friend Harper Lee (a very subdued, Catherine Keener)?<br /><br />\\"Capote\\" is a brilliant, shining example of deadly honest film making done at the very highest level. It is physically, psychically and mentally beautiful and like a fine old Burgundy it is meant to be consumed with as much commitment as it took to create it.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|Ever since I read the books I always thought that Tim Burton would be a great choice to direct the remake. I was right. Everything was much better than the original, which I still like an awful lot, and very wisely he only had the Oompa Loompas' sing in this version, with Danny Elfman's voice no less!<br /><br />  I didn't think everything was perfect however. Burton obviously can't help but add scenes like the Automated Puppets bursting into flame and showing oh too loving closeups of the resulting mutilations which, If I were six or seven, would have made me hate the film as a whole.<br /><br />  I also think that if you could transplant Gene Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka from the first version into this version, it would make the movie even more enjoyable. Wilder captured that mad quality Wonka had in the book, sly, mischievous, but not too mean or nasty. I do have to applaud Johnny Depp, though. He certainly made his Wonka memorable and unique.<br /><br />  All in all, a very satisfying movie, and one of the better ones this year. I would probably place it in my top five favorites of the year, alongside Star Wars Episode III, Batman Begins, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the Brothers Grimm.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Never was the timing more correct then now to breathe a breath of air into the dying lugs of the current music scene. Emo is dead and everything else is bubblegum wanna bee's with coporate influence dragging down all creative potential, lyrically, and musically. This is the first record in a long time that is art, with out being a guy hitting a snare drum for five minutes and moaning, with \\"ambient\\" music creeping in the background. This is unpretentious art. It not only achieves this status but is also fun to listen too, and not intented to take that seriously. The lyrics remain stellar through out almost reading like a lost Keroauc novel, and the music will leave you tapping your feet and humming the choruses. Lyrically, this album  laughs in the face of traditional song writing structure. The vocals are what Patrick Stump from FallOutBoy wishes he could sound like without Protools. The singers voice soars high, then hides almost to a wish keeping the listener on edge and creating a tention not seen in music today. So please take notice of Panic! At The Disco now because they are what our scenes future is, just a few years in advance and better.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|I recently heard someone say they were disappointed with Gilliam's \\"update\\" of the Famous Brothers and their Fables. Whoever said that doesn't understand Gilliam's modus operandi. He is a genius at creating brand new worlds(Time Bandits and Brazil) and Bringing old Folktales and fantasy stories back to their roots while still making them entertaining(Baron Munchausen).<br /><br />  The same is true of the Brothers Grimm. He offers a unique spin on Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, and quite distinctly the Gingerbead Man, but at the same time retains the essence of the original stories. Fariy Tales are DARK! They were meant to frighten Children into BEHAVING!<br /><br />  I also appreciated the emphasis on Character. With the Exception of Peter Stormare's hammy torturer, the Cast is Excellent. Matt Damon is always good, but Heath Ledger Steals the film with his portrayal of Jacob Grimm. And of course Jonathan Pryce is always enjoyable.<br /><br />  My biggest complaint though is a rather nasty scene involving a kitten. Gilliam can at times have an extremely nasty sense of humor and this was particularly unpleasant.<br /><br />  Gilliam's films are not for all tastes I confess. But I thouroughly enjoyed this film. I'll never look at the gingerbread man the same way again.
B000B0WODA|5.0|Im going to re-write my review to provide readers with an analysis of the album. I do admit that I enjoy fun music along with great bands such as Coldplay, and I believe this album deserves its recognition.This album takes listeners to a whole new level of music. I bought the first album considering the popular song \\"Take me out\\" last summer and in the beginning i was not satisfied because i thought the album was going to have much more catchier tunes, however, the first album grew on me and it later became known as a classic. This album is an amazing growth for franz ferdinand, taking tracks to new grounds with slow songs (which they have not done before) such as \\"Walk away\\", \\"Fade Together\\" and \\"....Put Your Boots On\\" often times sounding like the beatles and bringing back the spirit of the early 1970's. With that said, the album does provide its danceable music which im sure most people like to hear. Tracks such as \\"Im your villain\\" and the new hit \\"Do you want to\\" gives listeners tracks that most can nod their heads to. As the first album, franz ferdinand ends up pleasuring their audience with fun tracks and inspiring music. If you are not a franz ferdinand fan, I urge you to give the album a try. It is a new experiment for franz leaving the listeners with delightful music unheard of since the 80s.     1.The Fallen- a great opener and political track 9/10  2.Do you want to- one of the most danceable songs on the album 10/10  3.This boy- an alright track, good riffs...still worthy to be on the album 8/10  4.Walk away- would be great if it was a 2nd single, 10/10  5.Evil and a Heathen- good song, however, i find this song a bit too raw 8/10  6.You're the Reason I'm Leaving- a very fun track! I love it, personally one of my favorites, too bad its short though 10/10  7.Eleanor Put Your Boots on- Exploring the realm of the beatles, great experiment 10/10  8.Well That Was Easy- good song 9/10  9.What You Meant- alright song...8/10  10.I'm Your Villian- one of my favorite tracks on the album, when i listen to this song, the beat sounds like a villain is coming out in a movie 10/10  11.You Could Have It So Much Better- I dont know why this song was mentioned as a comparison to \\"Smells like teen spirit\\" however, i find this song to have good riffs and great melody 10/10  12.Fade Together- I personally love this song, its very psychadelic, reminds me of \\"because i got high\\", enjoyable song,perhaps it has two meanings... 9/10  13.Outsider- I love this track, awesome beat and great ending to the album 10/10    Please keep in mind that i am not an easy grader, however, i find this album to be a great sophomore album and perhaps another franz classic. A great purchase!
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I've been a fan of the Great Bard since about '65 while in Jr. High. So I really enjoy the hell out of this film. I love every minute of it,and cannot get over the old live concert footage. What a treat!! But beware. If you don't like Dylan, this film will be of little interest to you. My wife fell asleep before I got to the second disc. I heard her mumble something like  \\"..I still can't stand that voice\\" (this coming from a Neil Young fan!!).    So in conclusion: Any Dylan fan will love it. The average viewer not interested in The Mighty Zimm will not think much of it I guess.

It was a sad day years ago when Bill called it quits on the strip, but it's nice to have all of them collected within this keepsake.<br />I have heard a rumor that a couple of the strips have been edited because they contained content of Calvin being adopted.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I never watched firefly because to me it just looked like they were on the ship all the time with hardly any action. I guess I always chose the wrong time to switch in though. Because now that I saw the whole series on dvd I see what I missed out on. This show is great fun and you never know what's going to happen next to the crew of Serenity. What helps is that the crew is unpredictable and you never know when they'll do something heroic or steal from other ships. The acting and characters are top-notch as well. There's nothing bad I can say about this series. I can't say I saw one bad episode. Even the episodes that didn't make it on tv blew me away. Those 3 are 3 of the most entertaining episodes too.<br /><br />  In one of those you have Mal (Nathon Fillion) bumping into that foxy red head again who likes scam  men into thinking they're married to her. She has a heist planned that she wants Serenity to help her with. Which leads to one of the funniest endings. The 2nd one has Mal and Zoe open a package and find an old war buddy in it dead. However when an autopsy is about to be done, he appears to be very much alive. In the 3rd never viewed one. Serenity helps prostitutes battle a low life cowboy who wants to his baby from one of the women he got pregnant. He'll kill everyone of them until he gets it.<br /><br />  Some of the characters remind me a little of Buffy characters. The pilot Wash has the sort of wise cracking lines that we were used to hearing from Xander Harris. While the adorable Kaylee, the engine repair girl reminds me of  Willow when she was innocent and sweet. Hell a lot of Mal's speeches or wisecracks sound like something Buffy would say too. It's fun though seeing Whedon put some of Buffy characters in each Firefly character. The cast had a strong chemestry too with just fantasic scripts to work with on each episode. Each one just got better and better. I'm just clueless to why this show was canceled. It's better than most shows that are on the air now. After getting into the series it made me behind Whedon all the way in bringing it to the big screen. Plus after seeing Serenity I hope there's more as well.e air now.

B000A6T1KE|1.0|I may not rank too well with this review but this is the bottom line: This film is not Star Trek, it merely has similar characters. <br />I left dejected and weakened; how could someone do this to a franchise? <br />The one star (vs. no stars) fits because it's a very watchable movie for someone who doesn't know anything about the Star Trek universe.
B000AL730Y|5.0|Give this CD as a gift to someone that is having a really hard time in their life, and have them play \\"Too Much Rain\\". This is a powerful song about how it isn't fair that some people go through more than their share of pain. This song is destined to be a McCartney Classic.
0812550706|5.0|This should be top on the list of \\"must-read\\" stories for any sci-fi or fantasy fan.  If you haven't read it yet, ORDER IT NOW and get started.  You will not be sorry.  Ender's story is a classic tale, well written, with strong characters and plot lines.  Don't miss this book.  Once you've read it, you'll be an OSC fan for life.
B0009S3HI0|5.0|Oh, this is a must have for any true Deftones fan!  I've waited for years for a compilation such as this.  Each song is extremely diverse; from Wax and Wane, which has an electronic feel to Change, Digital Bath, and Be Quiet and Drive which are soulful acoustic versions.  I'm not a huge fan of covers, but the Deftones managed to bring their own sound to each one, which was refreshing.  I recommend buying this even though I haven't seen the DVD yet, but how can you go wrong with 12 Deftones videos on DVD???
B00005O5U9|5.0|By this time, it was very clear that Freddie Mercury was on his last legs.  With that, the band decided to do one last great album and what an album it turned out to be.  Already by this time, in fact since \\"The Miracle\\", Queen decided they had nothing to prove and had starting making music for themselves and were having fun again.  The tracks here are very beautiful and introspective as a result and this one in particular has become one of my favourites.  \\"Those Were The Days of Our Lives\\" still brings a tear to my eyes whenever I hear it.  Still, all is not doom and gloom as Freddie's sense of humour is still evident on \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" and \\"Delilah\\".  Other strong tracks are \\"Ride the Wild Wind\\" and \\"Headlong\\".  This remastered version means the cd sound quality is quite good indeed.  A highly recommended cd to have in your collection.
0312979479|5.0|I love this book. The first time reading it I was truly perplexed. It is an amazing mystery that will have you guessing up until the shocking end. It's a classic in the mystery genre and everyone should read it, you won't want to put it down!
B000244FDW|5.0|As P&P book fan I decided to purchase all available adaptations and as I have read so many positive reviews here at the amazon.co.uk website to raise my curiosity I bought the '80 BBC version.<br /><br />First of all let me tell you that watching the film was pure delight. Fay Weldon's script stayed faithful to the book without destroying the excitement or lessening its pleasures. I especially liked the end which was too short and precipitate in the '95 version: there you had no time to enjoy the part before Elizabeth & Darcy actually profess their love for each other, here it was more detailed and leisurely, which I found very positive. To my disappointment in the '95 version there was no scene with Mrs Bennet rejoicing over Lizzy's engagement which is of course much more fun than Mr Bennet expressing his concerns and doubts. Here the excellent Priscilla Morgan was given the chance and I liked it very much.<br /><br />The actors were all excellent. Elizabeth Garvie IS Elizabeth Bennet both physically and spiritually. Her sparkling eyes expressed all her emotions, her wit, playfulness and intelligence - just as Jane Austen described her. I actually liked Jennifer Ehle's performance up to now, but compared to Garvie she fades away and I actually discovered that she SMIRKS instead of smiling playfully or even mischievously. Garvie could act playfully and even challengingly without being impertinent or impolite: J Ehle simply couldn't.<br /><br />David Rintoul was also excellent, although I admit that I prefer Colin Firth's Darcy, but I found him a bit too rigid and aloof for a while. I know, I know, Darcy IS rigid and aloof, but I couldn't spot any difference in his behaviour towards strangers and his friends the Bingleys: he didn't looked relaxed for a second even in their company. However when I saw his \\"almost smile\\" in his eyes and on his lips he started to grow on me gradually. I still thought his acting monotonous occasionally, but I learned to like him.<br /><br />I also liked Barbara Shelley and Michael Lees as Mr & Mrs Gardiner: they were truly genteel and sensible, once again what Jane Austen might have in mind. Priscilla Morgan as Mrs Bennet and Malcolm Rennie (Mr Collins) looked and acted their part tremendously.<br /><br />This version is more like it was adapted to the stage (the other is a true movie adaptation, more dynamic) but after getting used to its pace I did not mind it at all.<br /><br />Clearly, this version did not have the budget the other did, but it did not spoil neither costume, nor scenery nor the lovely music.<br /><br />This is a must see adaptation for all Austen and P&P fans.<br /> <br />I also liked Barbara Shelley and Michael Lees as Mr & Mrs Gardiner: they were truly genteel and sensible, once again what Jane Austen might have in mind.

B000063UR1|5.0|I will skip the extravagant lingo. I am not an expert movie reviewer, but have spent a lifetime enjoying movies. I can tell you that Bruce Dern does an incredible job of acting in this movie.  <br /> <br />At 38 years old I remember my sister seeing it for the first time in the early 70's. She was moved to tears. The story that is told here is a real life example of what we have to face about ourselves. It pulls no punches about the level of cruelty and abuse that we all in some level inflict on this planet.  <br /> <br />It is easy to put this movie down if you have no brain cells because this movie will make you think. It is not for the people that think reality tv offers substance. Those individuals will be lost. <br /> <br />To say that Bruce Dern is a sociopath I believe is completely incorrect. He is a compassionate individual seeing everything that this planet has to offer in the way of beauty being destroyed.   <br /> <br />That could push anyone that is left on this planet today with a heart over the edge in my opinion. I am not a nature freak, nor one of those green peace guys. But I have seen enough clearing of rain forests and killing of majestic creatures to understand that this movie is reality.  <br /> <br />This is a must see for everyone. The robots are wonderful. No they are not state of the art machines like those computer animated fake creations everyone seems to revere these days. But they are capable of instilling a reality in the viewer that will make the viewer feel compassion even for the inanimate robots.  <br /> <br />This movie took me along time to come back to only because it is so riveting intellectually and quite sad overall in its message. Be prepared to feel the plight that Bruce Dern feels. Decide for yourself how it makes you feel. I'm thankful I saw it.
0792838068|5.0|This movie is a very good drama about two people who are suffering under the affliction of their life styles and become best friends and fall in love at the very end.Nicolas Cage gave a great performance in this movie.Elizabeth Shue was outstanding as always.I wish she would make more movies.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|I never really liked The Mars Volta all that much, and this album doesn't make me feel any different about them.  People keep telling me that we're going to be looking back fondly on the Volta; that they're the Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin of our generation. <br /> <br />Yeah, I laughed too. <br /> <br />There's nothing here but confused noodling, obtuse lyrics that seem laughably forced, and songs that stretch a good twenty minutes longer than they should.  Coming from a hardcore Sonic Youth fan who is long accustomed to ear-splitting noise, meandering improvisation, convoluted lyrics, and labyrinthian song structures, this is especially harsh.  None of the improvization on \\"Frances the Mute\\" seems organic at all.  When a Sonic Youth song crashes into an extended feedback and noise section (think \\"Total Trash\\", \\"Silver Rocket\\", the second half of \\"Mote\\", or \\"The Diamond Sea\\"), it feels and sounds like it was the only thing that could come next in the song-and it's a very satisfying feeling.  Most of what goes on in \\"Frances the Mute\\" seems like the result of a board meeting of blowhard critics, hipsters, and art majors on how one would go about making them cum the hardest.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|If you have listened to DCFC for years or are just coming on board with their totally unique vision, their new album \\"PLANS\\" is an instant great catch.  The lyrics grab you and the melodies spin in your brain like cotton candy on a stick.  You'll love it.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I remember I was in the 9th grade I walked all the way to Bestbuy just to buy this album which the distance from Bestbuy to my place at the time was a very long walk. I was a big Limp Bizkit fan in my 8th grade year thought they were the best band out there. Now that I have grown up and look back it's like man how in the world can you like this stuff? It's just terrible.. I threw away this cd along with all my other Limp Bizkit cd's awhile back ago. Now I still like alittle bit of material off there first 2 albums I'm not going to lie there good songs when you want to listen to something just for the kick and that don't really mean anything. But the lyrics on most Limp Bizkit songs are just pointless and real childish it is pathetic. Well I didn't want to give this cd 1 star but I had to. to Do not get this CD if you must get something Limp Bizkit get Three Dollar Bill Or Significant Other but even those albums after awhile will start to become pointless.
B0007Z4S4C|3.0|Though he is now in his 60's and probably has enough money to buy an island, the former lead singer of Led Zeppelin has graciously split the bill and dubbed himself as Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation for his eighth solo work, 'Mighty Rearranger.' It's a strained signal, meant to tell us that he's reinventing his sound rather than resting on his laurels. It's also a bit of a misnomer, because this background band is no more a presence than the players who backed him on better outings like 'Now and Zen' and the underrated 'The Fate of Nations.' I suppose we can admire his willingness to expand his oeuvre (indeed, we have more or less been instructed to do so), but unfortunately the results are not compelling.    Mind you, there's good stuff at the front and back. The opener \\"Another Tribe\\" is a beautifully simple commentary on the war, while the single \\"Shine It All Around\\" works to a funky big noise in the chorus. Third is the irresistibly titled \\"Freedom Fries,\\" which is more interesting lyrically than musically; it starts with an ode to \\"American Pie\\" and goes on to rather one-dimensionally dissect the Bushes (whose greed may, in fact, deserve no more than one dimension). After that, the album drops off a cliff. I suspect it's all supposed to play as adult folk, but mostly it's kind of stuffy and boring until the title track at the end.    The objective of 'Mighty Rearranger' is made clear in the lyrics to \\"Tin Pan Valley\\": \\"My peers may flirt with cabaret, some fake the `rebel yell.' Me, I'm moving up to higher ground, I must escape their hell.\\" I won't argue with Mr. Plant that he's doing better work these days than Billy Idol (hardly a daunting task), and I'll gladly acknowledge that a subpar Robert Plant album is still better than the best of many modern artists. However, I hope he'll see fit to scan back over his fair-haired days for inspiration next time around. He's better when his roots are showing.
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks is my favorite Van Morrison album. The rough edges, the acoustic instruments, lyrics, all of it. This is the best album available to test speakers with. The sound of each instrument is just incredible.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Or better yet, my favorite animated film of all time.<br /><br />I can see how some have problems with the movie. It is extremely violent, and I think the confusing nature of the plot trips some people up.<br /><br />This movie really makes you THINK, and it doesn't really give you all the answers. I have seen this film a number of times, and I still don't understand everything that happened, and I have read all the mangas too! Doesn't matter. Everything doesn't have to be spelled out to be good. Everything doesn't have to say \\"Hey, this is what happened\\". I don't mind the ambiguity. And a lot of other people obviously don't either.<br /><br />For those that say this film is boring...uh, whatever. It has TONS of action. It starts with one of the coolest motorcycle actions scenes I have ever watched. The battles toward the end are exciting and downright brutal. The whole film is extreme. From the vocal performances to actually what is happening in the animation. It's a very intense film.<br /><br />As for the technicals...the film was made in 1988, and yeah, animation has advanced since then, but the film is still beautifully animated. I have a hard time recalling any cell animated film wiith so much attention to detail than this one. And the music is phenomenal. Tribal drums pounding, and japanese choruses chanting throughout the picture. Wonderful.<br /><br />This new edition is superb. They have really sharpened up the picture a great deal. There are a few times when the specks of dust show up, but overall it looks great. The new dubbing is VERY welcome. For those who hang onto the Streamline version...I can't understand why. It must be nostalgia. The old translation didn't even make sense to what was happening on the screen. And for a movie that is this complex, having a translation that bad pretty much made the film impenetrable. The only problem I have is that the voices aren't done by top actors, like in Steamboy or the Miyaziki pictures. It's a real shame that one of the shining jewels in animation doesn't have the best treatment in the audio section. Still, it's much better than before. And, there's always the Japanese track, which is great. That's the way I watch it.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this film is a true masterpiece. It's not for kids at all, and you must be ready to think when you watch it. It's not just some cheap action movie. It's deep and complex, as well as beautiful. That's the reason this film is considered such a classic.<br /><br />I hope you like it as much as I do.<br /><br />Sam M.l shame that one of the shining jewels in animation doesn't have the best treatment in the audio section.

0385720920|4.0|This was the first novel I read by chuck and I plan to get some of his other works.  I must be a total perv because I was fascinated by the main characters sexual addictions.  I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't want to read a run of the mill predictable story.  I would not recommend it for people who are not comfortable with crude language or sexual descriptions.
B000084T18|2.0|How could he make that statement in a song? Half the time you can't understand what he says. Cause he mumbles when he rhymes. Also, H-E-L-L-O!? You just signed a major deal with Eminem, one of the most popular acts in music! Your no longer underground. There are only 4 songs on this CD I like: <br /> <br />1.What Up Gangsta <br />2.Patiently Waiting <br />3.Don't Push Me <br />4.Wanksta
0452282152|4.0|A teenaged girl named Griet leaves behind her family to take up domestic service in the household of the celebrated Dutch painter Jan Vermeer. Though she is but a kitchen maid, Griet comes to the notice of the master painter who, while faithfully wed to his strict Catholic wife, becomes fascinated with her and makes her his model for his most famous work \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring.\\" This novel imagines the life history of the wistfully expressive girl in the painting, gives her a name and background, and then creates the circumstances under which she came to be in the portrait. This is an exercise in filling in the blanks in one of art's mysteries, and it is a skillful creation that sets the world of 17th century Holland back to life again more than three-hundred years after the original scenes of the book have passed.
B0002234LS|4.0|This movie would have been utterly terrible without Johnny Depp in the starring role.  If you are seeing this movie for the first time, try not to think too much about what will happen.  Otherwise, it is pretty obvious to predict what will happen. <br />  Depp plays a quirky writer who is in the middle of a divorce.  He had caught his wife cheating on him.  A man named John Shooter harasses Depp about plagiarism and things begin to get very violent.  Depp creates an entertaining charachter out of a fairly boring role.   <br />  As the plot unfolds, people die and the story takes very strange turns.  Even though this movie is not the greatest, it is still a must see. <br />  The music and cinematography are good in the film.  The acting is sup par besides the performances of Johnny Depp and John Turturro.  This movie deserves and eight out of ten. <br />
0060872675|5.0|I cut my teeth on Ogden Nash's \\"Custard The Dragon\\" and my son gets both Mr. Nash AND Mr. Pratchett -- what more could a mom ask for?  I laughed so hard, especially at the \\"Sizzle\\".  My son loves the disc world characters, especially the swamp dragons and the wee free men.  He gets to blame \\"Mr. Nobody\\" (i.e, his Rob Anybody) for a wide variety of transgressions (which I don't really let him get away with).  Enjoy and remember, it's better if you read it with a small person on your lap. <br />
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The new Mars Volta Album Frances the Mute, is one of the most artsy, flashy, and strangest sounding pieces of art to ever exist.  This band has gone to even bolder limits then their last album, Deloused in the Comatorium.  They use even more styles and odd time signatures.  This album will make you think long and hard.  It is only for those with true grit. <br />  The first song is thirteen minutes long.  There is about a three minute outro that Mars Volta is common for doing with strange electronic sounds.  The song starts off very fast and loud.  The guitar uses jazz chords and twists them around to make them sound punk/progressive.  There is very fast drumming in this song and lots of dynamics. <br />  The next song is the radio-friendly, The Widow.  This reminds me of a modern Led Zeppelin song.  This song is very catchy and has a guest appearance with \\"Flea\\" of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.  He plays trumpet on the track. <br />  \\"L'Via,\\" the third song, is by far the best song the band has ever made.  It is a hardcore/latin/progressive song that has lyrics in both english and spanish.  Amazing guitar and paino solos really make the song along with help from the main riff. <br />  The last two songs with strain your brain just trying to grasp the eccentric concepts.  They are not worth listening to if you are feeble minded.  Otherwise, the album is a 9 out of 10 on the whole.   <br />
0740748475|3.0|I used to look forward to Calvin and hobbes every morning when I grew up until, at age 11, it ended.  I have many fond memeories of this Comic, but going back to them is somewhat disappointing.  While some are funny others are often boring.  For every work of genius there is a sad retread of an older joke.  These were meant to be read once a day, and reading a large group really wears you out.  I always thought the comic was a bit overrated, and it seems that Watterson may have been a one-trick pony since so many of his comics are basically the same gag over and over.  After the Greatness that was the Far Side collection, I think my hopes may have been too high, but that Collection is definetly a better value.
0307276902|3.0|Unlike many of the negative reviewers of this book, I would never imply that what James Frey has written is exaggerated or untrue. Nobody's recovery is the same. I do however, find it very unusual for someone so terribly addicted to alcohol and a bunch of drugs to come across so pompous and confident. Guilt and self-loathing are known to be very difficult issues for people in recovery, especially early recovery.  While James Frey thinks these things at various times in the book, what he actually articulates comes across differently. I had to check the back of the book a couple of times because I was sure I must have read the length of recovery wrong. Nope, he went from an alcoholic, multi-drug-using mess to a real life super-hero rescuing a poor lost soul from a crackhouse, in just six weeks! Amazing! It was a very difficult read from a literary, as well as an emotional standpoint. However, this is the first memoir I've read on addiction and I am curious to read some of the others that reviewers have recommended.  I usually like most \\"Oprah picks\\", but this goes to show, not even Oprah is right all the time. Unless you've been through addiction and recovery or extremely close to someone that has (and maybe she has), I don't see how you could ever \\"get\\" this book.
B000093BDX|3.0|They could have picked songs from their later stuff that was better than what they put on this CD.
B0009IW88A|5.0|This is an excellent soundtrack - no ands, or, buts about it. I am not familiar with Elfman's score, but whether people think this soundtrack reaches those expectations or not, there's nothing to complain about here. It is a very rare thing when it comes to sountracks that I can listen to every single song. I never skip anything, this CD is that good, and I listen to it constantly.  <br /> <br />   As far as I'm concerned, that's easily enough to earn a 5 star rating. Elfman may have a great score for all I know, but this music couldn't have been better. It fit the movie beautifully. Many of the songs consist of variations of the main theme, but I happen to like the main theme a lot, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest.  <br /> <br />  I loved it. Some people won't love it as much as I do, but regardless, this is very well composed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Because TV, when it's good, can be so achingly good. And this show is an absolute delight.  We got the DVD as a lark before seeing the movie and spent a lost weekend with it.  In the space of 14 episodes, I went from \\"Huh, this is odd and they sure talk funny\\" to crying over the theme song of the last episode because it was almost over.  Great TV as an art form creates a long relationship that builds over time, and it can only be imagined where this show would have gone.  I'm just so glad to have discovered it.
B00005JO0J|5.0|i will admit i am a fan of the series, so it makes sense that i loved this movie...enough to go watch it three times already, and i will go see it a few more...what suprised me is that every time i have gone so far, the crowd gets bigger...the first time we caught the morning showing, and there were about 10 people there...and we all loved it...granted, we were all browncoats (firefly fans), but then that should make us the harshest critics, no?  the second time, there were about 50 people, and not a single person did not enjoy themselves...the third time, the theatre was practically bursting, and STILL everyone was absorbed in the movie...all ages, all races, everyone had a great movie expereince...and that is what makes a great movie...when people who have seen it tell friends who will then go see it and tell more friends, etc.  so...GO SEE IT!!!
0142401080|5.0|This book really gets out a lot of color and fun to readers of all ages.  After watching both movies based off of this book, I wanted to compare them to the book.  The author really does a great job in entertaining children, as well as adults, with his famous tale of a boy and a chocolate factory.
0312305060|3.0|I found this novel terribly disappointing.  I had just read A Home At The End Of The World and was desperately in need of more fantastic literature.  I assumed that this novel would be just as great, if not even better.  Well, I made an ass out of you and me.  I found it boring and rather difficult to get through.  It was a quick, easy read, but I was bored to tears through most of it.  I think I only got through it because I was eager to finish it and move on to a better book.  The only reason it gets any stars at all is because once again, I am sucked in by Cunningham's writing.  I wouldn't say DON'T read it, because I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who adore this novel and I'm sure they are right, in their own way.  Personally, however, I didn't enjoy it near as much as I'd hoped.
B0000025T6|5.0|This is a great album though very dark and intense.  \\"Atlantic City\\" has to be considered one of his greatest songs, it's a slice of life right out of \\"On the Waterfront\\".  This is the album he made with just tape recorder and his own wits (which as you can see from this album are considerable).  It's a necessity for anyone who appreciates Bruce and takes him personally.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|4 and a half stars actually.  The songs on this cd are great, as far as I am concerned.  Its not like many greatest hits where they leave off one or two very big songs, all of the best of Jimi is here.  My only complaint is the sound quality on some songs, not all of them though.  Some songs have a noice present during them, which I find distracting.  But overall this is a very good compilation.
