B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love listening to scripture as I'm falling to sleep and while I'm getting ready in the morning. At night once my kindle goes to black screen which I have set at 15 minutes, the chapter being read finishes and that's it. This makes meditation so good since you catch things differently hearing than you do by reading alone. Add to this the reading plans, the multiple versions available, the social networking if you want it, note taking ability, etc. All of the above makes this free app great!!!!!!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Was a awesome book to read. Did not just cover OBL raid but went through the training it takes and other missions they go on. Great for anyone who wants to know more about DEVGRU and their actions.<br /><br />Finished it in 2 days and highly recommended.

B003R0LBVW|5.0|I am surprised to say that I like this novel. Having read several of Franzen's long-winded, self-important essays, I expected his fiction to be similar. This book is long. There is no denying that, but it is also compelling. Franzen has created vivid characters and set his stage with meticulous detail. He must have done extensive research to be able to assemble all the facts about conservation that he weaves into the story.

B009AMAK0E|4.0|I knew that I wanted to see Trouble with the Curve without knowing anything about the plot. The reason? Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams are so likable. Eastwood claimed that he would never act again after making Gran Torino, but I'm happy that he changed his mind. Eastwood plays baseball scout, Gus Lobel, and his character is similar to Walt from Gran Torino in many ways. He's hard to get along with, even if you happen to be one of his close friends.<br /><br />One thing I should point out is that Trouble of the Curve is funny. Although it's tagged as a drama, there is a lot of humor in the movie. Eastwood has good comic timing and his character delivers one-liners at every opportunity. The audience in my theater laughed loudly and often. But the story also has the ability to move you emotionally. It feels somewhat like a James L. Brooks movie, such as Broadcast News or As Good as It Gets.<br /><br />Like Moneyball, Trouble with the Curve is about people more than it is about Baseball. Gus has three months left on his contract and with the exception of his friend, Paul (John Goodman), people are starting to wonder whether he's still capable of doing his job. He's a dinosaur, preferring to dig through a pile of newspapers for statistics, rather than rely on computers for the information. His boss (Matthew Lillard) wants to replace him.<br /><br />The thing is, there is some truth to the belief that Gus is struggling to do his job as a scout. His eyesight is failing and it doesn't go unnoticed. Paul pays him a visit and advises him of the situation, asking him if he has considered the future, but Gus won't listen. In desperation, Paul asks Gus's daughter, Mickey (Adams), to go on the road and help out her father with his latest scouting assignment. She's an ambitious lawyer, and on the verge of becoming a partner, but she agrees to squeeze it into her schedule and intervene.<br /><br />Adams is a talented actress and I've been waiting for her to get a meaty role after earning an Oscar nomination for her performance in Doubt. Her role in The Fighter was too brief to count. I've yet to see The Master, but I came away thinking this was the best Amy Adams performance in the past four years. I mentioned that she is likable, but she's also good at what she does. There's a certain intelligence and vulnerability to her characters that I find appealing, and it's present in Mickey. She appears successful on the outside, but she has never been close to her father.<br /><br />There are three main themes present in the movie:<br /><br />If you have seen Absolute Power, you'll know that Eastwood is convincing as a father who has a problematic relationship with his daughter. One of the keys to Trouble with the Curve is seeing how Mickey attempts to resolve her issues with Gus.<br /><br />The most obvious issue is with Gus, as old age threatens his livelihood. Director Robert Lorenz takes plenty of time at the outset to establish his characters, allowing us to get an idea of what is at stake. Is Gus washed up, or does he still have something to offer? I won't ruin that for you.<br /><br />The other main theme is the ability to decide what constitutes happiness. It's different for everyone. Are you happy because you earn a good salary and thrive in your career? What about personal relationships and family? How about having time to enjoy your life?<br /><br />It's clear that Gus is happy working as a baseball scout, but what isn't clear is how Mickey views her own life. Is she truly happy as a lawyer? Can she come to terms with the distance between her and her father? She's also romantically involved with a man who thinks of her as a commodity rather than as a woman he loves. He figures that they get along quite well and are both successful, so it would make sense for them to be together. He's not the most romantic of men.<br /><br />That's the setup. As you can see, there are a lot of issues at stake.<br /><br />One thing the movie does badly is make it obvious which characters you are supposed to root for, and who you should dislike. That flaw makes it easy to predict the outcome for Gus, Mickey, and at least three other minor characters. Those flaws aside, I enjoyed the pacing and the thorough characterization.<br /><br />If this turns out to be Eastwood's final acting role, it's not a bad way to finish. As for Adams, it is good to see her in a role which allows her to show that she can actually act. I should also mention Justin Timberlake, who plays a former baseball player and young talent scout. He's also interested in Mickey if she'll let down her defenses long enough.<br /><br />Trouble with the Curve isn't a great movie, but it's very good, and one that I want to own. It's a pleasure to spend time with the actors and the story has a lot of warmth. If you're a fan of Eastwood or Adams, I doubt that you'll be disappointed.ke it obvious which characters you are supposed to root for, and who you should dislike.

B000021Y77|5.0|Two lovers are caught in a bad situation to say the least, Manni (Moritz Blebibtreu) calls his girlfriend Lola (Franka Potente, \\"Blow\\") and says he's gonna be killed by a mob boss if he doesn't come up with 100,000 marks very soon (20 minutes in fact). He begs Lola for help and says if she can't help him he's going to rob a supermarket to get the money to save his life. Panicked and frantic Lola takes off running out of her apartment to help Manni, what follows is 3 different showings of Lola's sprint to save Manni by getting this money.<br /><br />Each situation shows how little things can either delay or help someone get somewhere faster, like not tripping over someone on a sidewalk, catching a casino at just the right time to gamble and win said money, so okay its more like just a game of chance and with her boyfriends impending death Lola feels the compulsion to do whatever she can to help. Each showing of her run has little differences to it and the first two don't end well for obvious reason (what need would there be to show the next one if the first or second one ends with everyone happy).<br /><br />Between the pursuits are some drama scenes with Manni and Lola talking that are decent but the film really shines during the running scenes. There's a pulse-pounding German techno soundtrack during most of the movie which does get the adrenaline pumping and I personally enjoyed looking at Franka as she's quite stunning and gives a good performance here (though she would go on to do better movies after this).<br /><br />This flick is a perfect example though of style over substance and the 81 minute running time is just right as any more would've made the experience tiring in my opinion. If it was rated on plot it wouldn't score much above average, but as a fun and fast film its quite entertaining and thats all this movie could've hoped to be. ***1/2 out of 4 stars, simply as a fun experience.
0525953728|5.0|One cannot go wrong with reading this book. It puts the reader in the action and makes one feel like they are watching history unfold with every turn of the page. I am so glad someone put their neck on the line to get the true story out!
0783225849|5.0|Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a young woman who is given a good sum of money to take to the bank so a customer can purchase a home, while on the way to the bank suddenly greed takes over and a chance to start a new life appeals greatly to Ms. Crane so she decides to take off in her car with the money. She purchases a new car, has a banter with a sheriff who stops her on a road, then Marion decides to stop for the night at a hotel, The Bates Motel. This is run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is well troubled shall we say, even after a dinner with Norman Marion still stays the night and this is where the famous shower murder scene occurs and Marion meets her untimely end. The rest of the movie has a private detective search for Marion (only to meet his own sad end) and Marion's sister (Vera Miles) decides to also look for answers.<br /><br />Director Alfred Hitchcock truly made a great classic here, while it was made in 1960 it does still old up today thanks to Hitchcock's style and ability to show both creepiness and care when it comes to his actors. Perkins is absolutely fantastic as Bates, Leigh does well as Crane and the rest of the performances are also quite good. The shower scene was fantastically done as Hitchcock took special care to make sure no nudity or knife wounds were shown, just did the cuts and shots so well to make sure it still chilled you without being violent.<br /><br />What's great about \\"Psycho\\" is you can appreciate how Hitchcock was able to play on a lot of people's fears and how there no bad action goes unpunished (hence the greed of Marion sadly leading to her end in the hotel). Also Alfred turned the horror/suspense franchise into an art with this film that few have ever been able to recapture. The build-up and conclusion are also very well done and its one of the few movies I can pull out of my collection and watch, just to enjoy some good classic film making. **** out of 4 stars.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy to play and very addictive.  Good graphics.  Highly recommend this game. I can't wait to unlock the other games.
B008220DGE|1.0|Hype and casting got us into the theater; film qualities, music, intensity of main characters kept us hoping for some sense to be made.  When the credits rolled, I commented, \\"well, what was all that about?\\"  My husband laughed with relief.  He was afraid he had missed some compelling point and I was going to help him \\"see the light\\".  While I found bits and pieces that tied some of my own history together, it was not satisfying.  We paid, we sat, we do not recommend.
B002L5KKK2|5.0|My Italian neighbor recommended this movie.  She said, \\"If you want to know what my childhood on Author Ave was like watch this movie.\\" I was very hesitant, I'm very picky and critical when it comes to movies but I decided to give it a try. I loved it. The message is a very good one and it's it very entertaining. It's one of those movies you talk about after watching.
0061743526|5.0|I know you probably already read this book at some point in your either distant or not-so-distant past, depending on how long you have been out of high school.  So did I (I'm in the distant past category).  I liked it then, I loved it now.<br /><br />Beautifully crafted, this book celebrates doing the right thing even when it is not the popular thing.  Fighting a losing battle for a worthy cause.  And parenting through example.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird tells the tale of a white lawyer defending a black man accused of raping a white woman in 1935.  But before Atticus Finch can defend Tom Robinson, he must first protect him from a public lynching in this Southern Alabama town, where the most crooked white man is still perceived as more credible than the most honest black man.  But can Atticus protect Robinson from legal injustice?  And what price will his two young children pay when he tries?<br /><br />Told from the viewpoint of Atticus's eight year old-daughter, Scout, this book leaves lasting impressions on topics of racism, justice, and parenting.<br /><br />As I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird this time, I found myself wondering if this celebrated novel would even get published in today's cut-throat publishing world, where readers are looking for some serious conflict and mayhem by the end of the first chapter.  Instead, Harper Lee takes the time to introduce the characters and setting, making Maycomb, Alabama come alive with all of the players typical of a small town.  I grew up in such a town so I recognized the trueness of them.<br /><br />Like many books, this book was difficult to put down.  Unlike any other book, it made me want to be a better parent . . . and a better person.

B004LQGXPA|5.0|When I saw this movie as a young man, I felt there was \\"not a lot of fighting for a war movie.\\" Well, this is more than a great war movie: it is a character study, and a great investigation into the noble-tragic human condition. What else can be said?
B006OFN0BQ|5.0|This is another TIME PERIOD PIECE movie which AGAIN, leave it to ONE popular actor to make it EXCELLENT.

Ashton can be the dumbest character, or just plain dorky, but he is still SO handsome & very strong characters which he plays.  This makes us appreciate his acting even more-so. He always takes you with him into the adventure and makes it BELIEVABLE-or not! I am sorry, who is she?  Oh, I thought this was about the hot guy again.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Layout was good on the Kindle and easy to read. The book was well written and made me feel I was there with the action. The way the story flowed and brought all the smaller stories together to form the whole was well done. My only complaint was the obsession of the author with nudity. Katniss becomes naked on several occasions throughout the book and rarely registers any self-consciousness at being viewed by adult men. That contributes nothing to the story line and is unnecessary. I appreciated the lack of profanity. The author was able to tell a good tale without taking that low road. Having seen the movie first, it was interesting to see how faithful to the book the movie succeeded in being. The tenderness and affection between Katniss and Rue was endearing and was better developed in the book. It appeared that Rue reminded Katniss of her sister Prim and served as a connection to her family.

B008966SIU|5.0|Grizzly Bear isn't all that accessible at first.  Their songs feel delicate and fragile, each one a work of art constructed under intense deliberation, as opposed to just some fun sing-along tunes.  This is part of what makes this album so interesting to me though.  The fantastic news is that this isn't just an album to admire, but is also very easy to enjoy.  By around my fourth or fifth listen I got to where I loved every song with the exception of one... A Simple Answer.  (Still, the only part that draws me in are the last two minutes of that song).  This music is so rich and complex that it's staggering, and is also just downright confounding at times.  Half Gate is still a total mystery to me, and one of the most delicious compositions on the record.  The album is terrifically trippy in some places, and really manages to stretch the mind to unfamiliar sonic territory.  I'm so happy to report that this is an excellent addition to the band's discography.  For fans of indie rock, psychedelic folk, or anyone with an open and curious mind.

B007Q4Y9I2|5.0|In their latter days of international super-stardom ELP were often justifiably accused of an excess of choreographed showmanship and the triumph of technique over genuine feeling in the music, especially in their spectacular, no-holds-barred big-arena stage shows.<br /><br />Well, not here. This first album, recorded in 1970, is a landmark of musical innovation and virtuosity born of the fresh enthusiasm of youth combining classical music motifs (Emerson was a classically trained pianist), the improvisational ideas of jazz fusion, some standard rock-genre verse-chorus song structures and even some simple folk-derived melodies to produce an enjoyable cocktail of excellence still eminently listenable after 40 years: a sure sign of greatness.<br /><br />This 2012 package from Sony offers two CDs plus an audio-only DVD presented in a 4-section fold-out with the original album-cover art front-and-back. The first disk features the original album mix produced in 1970 by Greg Lake; the second a recent stereo remix adding some bonus material and the DVD is in 5.1 surround sound DTS & PCM stereo. All the remixing work was done by Grammy-winning sound wizard Steven Wilson. A 16-page booklet replete with period photos from the 1970s, full track listings and story-narrative by Chris Welch completes the package.<br /><br />Of most interest to fans will probably be the extra material on CD-2 & the DVD. This includes:<br /><br />* An extended version of `Knife Edge' (a reworking of Janacek's classic `Sinfonietta'), plus a wholly instrumental cut of the same track<br /><br />* An early studio recording of Mussorgsky's `Promenade' from the `Pictures at an Exhibition' suite, with Greg Lake singing unaccompanied in perfect pitch<br /><br />* A syncopated track titled `Rave Up' which subsequently evolved into `Mass' on `Tarkus' showcasing some awesome time-switching interplay between Emerson and Palmer<br /><br />* A drum solo from Carl - probably of interest only to drummers<br /><br />* Several alternate takes of `Lucky Man' and `Take a Pebble' (one wholly instrumental but unfortunately cut short)<br /><br />Fusing classical and rock music has always been difficult and rarely successful, possibly managed with true panache only by ELP. The original album mix sounds as good as ever, from the lounge-jazz-feel middle section of the 12-minute `Take a Pebble' to Emerson's awesome piano and church-organ work on `The Three Fates.' Because some of the 1970 master tapes - notably of `Tank' - are lost, even a sound wizard like Wilson is unable to improve on some of the original recordings, and doubtless nit-picking audiophiles will never be satisfied. But overall the sound (especially on the DVD, if you have the equipment to exploit its qualities) is good.<br /><br />If you don't have this interesting piece of rock history in your collection, then this is the one to buy. If you've only ever heard ELP's successful singles such as `Lucky Man' and `Father Christmas' and don't know their adventurous early album material, then this is where you should start. It's a purchase you're unlikely to regret and for the price, it's a steal.>* Several alternate takes of `Lucky Man' and `Take a Pebble' (one wholly instrumental but unfortunately cut short)<br /><br />Fusing classical and rock music has always been difficult and rarely successful, possibly managed with true panache only by ELP.

1400079276|5.0|[[ASIN:1400079276 Kafka on the Shore]]<br /><br />My review's perspective is from already reading this novel and liking it enough to want to add it to my collection. I feel this is one of Murakami's stronger novels - and aside from 'After Dark' I consider it one of my favorites. I have slowly and steadily begun building up a collection of his novels after finishing almost all of his fiction. I am currently reading 'The Wind Up Bird Chronicle.' This is the same edition I checked out from a library and I particularly enjoy the translation; I am also studying Japanese, and have only the vaguest idea of the original, but he has not cut so many corners that I feel strong essences are lost. Gorgeous cover, the contents are superb - all in all, a good edition and I would recommend it to anyone. I would say to read it before buying it, because some find this a weaker installment of Murakami's, though I am inclined to greatly disagree.<br /><br />Arrived promptly on time in two days (I qualified for free two-day shipping).
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|I didn't go in with high expectations considering some of the reviews I've read here.  To be honest, I thought the movie was alright.  It's not exactly non-stop action from beginning to end and it can drag a bit in certain places.  Nevertheless, I didn't get bored.<br /><br />The bluray is first rate in all regards.  It was very impressive in terms of picture and sound. 10/10 for the disc and 6/10 for the flick itself.
B00846REIS|2.0|Unfortunately this book was so similiar to Fifty Shades it's rediculous.  Maybe if I had read Bared first it would have been a better read, however I read Fifty before and LOVED it.  The awkward meeting of Eva and Gideon with her being \\"clumsy\\" was too much like Ana in Fifty.  It seems odd that both authors could come up with nearly the same story line.  I read Bared, barely. Will not buy the 2nd book.
B004USLWVE|2.0|I travel a lot for work (both domestic and international) and take side-trips for photography. So I needed a good backpack to carry all my gear: 5D2 + 15 fisheye + 16-35L + 35L + 50/f1.4 + 70-200/2.8 + flash + 15.6\\" laptop + accessories (adapter, charger, filters, Kindle, etc.). Since a lot of my travel photography is in urban settings, I wanted a pack with side access. The Tamarac looked perfect.<br /><br />The functional design is fantastic -- love that the camera compartment can be accessed from both right and left sides; means I don't have to stack lenses and root through them to get to the bottom -- I can access all 4 of my extra lenses just by opening one zipper. Laptop compartment is roomy. The storage compartment on the top can hold my Kindle + space for adapter, charger, etc. External zippered side storage holds my passport perfectly. Lots of internal storage slots for cards, filters, etc.<br /><br />The build is disappointing though. The zippers are not as beefy as on my Lowepro, ThinkTank, or ClikElite bags -- they may work fine, or they may not (found out later from a friend he had his front access zipper fail on a trip). The biggest disappointment are the straps -- very thin with a lot of extra length that just flaps around. The shoulder straps are the deal-breaker. I wore it around the house with just my camera gear and after 45 minutes my shoulders were itching to get them off. The straps are quite narrow so they don't distribute the load well and they're also a bit abrasive. Not the cushiony feel of a Lowepro or ClikElite (did a 12-mile hike yesterday with my fully-loaded ClikElite in complete comfort). No way could I imagine walking around for 10-12 hours with the Tamarac.<br /><br />Despite the great design, I ended up returning the Tamarac. Got the Dakine Quest instead -- camera compartment is quite a bit tighter than the Tamarac, but way more comfortable to carry.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Good game for kids and adults. Great way to practice math skills. Would like to see side-by-side matches as well as vertical. Otherwise a great game.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read enjoyed really all the books in the series, and this book was good.  It kept me guessing the entire time and I was happy with how things turned out in the end.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd is my all time favorite band.  This cd did not disappoint me. I love about 9 out of 11 songs. Worth adding to a library.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is well crafted and beautifully designed. Just a simple and relaxing touch game. I would have zero issues with paying for this game.<br />I use a Huawei Mercury. Plays this game flawlessly.
B000067QMD|5.0|These sealing discs are great for traveling. They provide your Avent bottles the perfect airtight seal with no leaks, so long as you remember to use the blue ring. All you have to do is push these through the larger white ring on your Avent bottle and once you hear a small pop, you know that it's in place. Then screw it close, it's that simple. These discs also make your bottles smaller and easier to pack in your diaper bag/cooler as well, since you don't have to use the nipple and cap. Sometimes it's just easier to pack the bottles with the discs and store the nipples/caps separately.<br /><br />You get a set of six per pack, which for most, is more than enough. They're easy to clean, don't stain or warp, and store easily too. So long as you don't forget to use the blue ring on your bottle and properly use the discs, these sealing discs won't leak out any milk.<br /><br />This is a good buy if you can get it on sale on the site, otherwise look elsewhere for a better price. It's great for parents who are on the go and are looking to store baby bottles more efficently.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|Like a not so great Mario Kart. Wish you could drive by tiling the phone. I controls are so so at best. Hard to tell how good it really is with only one rather tame demo level.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|We bought this movie for our son but the wife and I love it just as much as he does!
B0087HT36U|5.0|The game is a great time waster  :-) Love the first person view, definitely prefer it over the side view of angry birds. Lots of fun, keep up the good work developers!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|The opening scen pulls you in and the action simply keeps coming!  Even my wife loved the movie and she really doesn't care for Tom Cruise.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a book that you can't put down.  It takes you to a world that you may never have understood.  The more you read the more you want to understand the depth of the characters.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|very relaxing gets rid of stressl and gives your mind a good workout. good graphics but uses a lot of battery because you get addicted to game
0062082353|3.0|This was a birthday gift.  They were happy with the book, however, it did take quite a while to get the book.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After reading the first two \\"50\\" books, I felt the need to finish the trilogy. In all honesty, I liked the characters and enjoyed the trash. They are simple, quick reads. However, this last book seemed as if the author had trouble finishing the storyline. It ended poorly and bounced all over the place with very little congruancy. I wouldn't stop anyone from reading it, but at the same time, don't get your hopes up for a great read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Steamy and an excellent read.  I can't wait for the next one on Oct 2, already bought and paid for.
B004T5K3OK|5.0|This is the only way I can use my printer now. My laptop is has Windows 7 and I can't print to my wireless printer. Now I open it on my phone and use this to print out what I need
B004H83IFA|4.0|If youre like me and like watching the 48 hour, dateline, Investigation Discovery type shows, then you'll love this movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading fifty shades, I was trying to find something like it and a friend told me about this book. I loved it and can't wait for the second one to come out. The characters past is darker than fifty shades, so be prepared, but I still highly recommend this book.
0345803485|1.0|This is the worst book I have read in a long time.  The only reasons I finished it are that it was an easy reader (like a children's book) - despite being X-rated on the sexual count - and I wanted to find out firsthand what all the hype is about.  I am glad to say that I borrowed the book and didn't fork out my hard-earned money on it.  I am encouraged to read that many readers like me found the references to the inner goddess and subconscious grating.  These, like the repetitions - were annoying, childish and slowed down the plot - what plot there was to be had.  I found the repetitions so aptly recounted by DS from LA, unbelievable.  How can this get past an editor/ publisher?<br /><br />I don't read erotica or much romance and didn't find the sexual references either interesting or `hot' to quote the author.<br /><br />Character development is in its infancy in this book.  The characters didn't interest me in the slightest and I could not see the fascination Mr. C. Grey had in Anastasia, other than her beautiful face and skinny body.  And how can a 28-year-old become not only a billionaire but so accomplished in so many things: piano, helicopter-flying, knowledge of wines, etc.?<br /><br />And yet it is a multi-million seller! Its success beggars belief.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I actually was enjoying this game on my Kindle Fire- I find it easier to control where the projectile goes than games like Angry Birds. And then I came to level 2-28. A cart comes rolling along and the controls are locked until it is too late to save the girl. I looked up the run through on You-tube and they were able to respond long before the rolling cart hit. I got the app as a FAOD. If this is fixed I would give it 5 stars.
0307474259|5.0|There are numerous four and five star reviews where people have had great success with weight loss.<br /><br />There are a number of three star reviews and below and people express their opinions but not one person in any of those reviews says I tried the Taubes way and didn't lose weight.
B000YAA68C|3.0|always loved Judy but when I saw her sing in kinda tandem with Hillary to parallel a deep loss of love it spoke to me like never before, what a powerful performance!!!  I know this is about Gerry n Holly but everyone else makes do with their incisive comments... I found Gerry to be resurrected to walking on water, EVERY single scene with him looking so loving, handsome, and most of all seXy....  who is married after 10yrs in NYC and sees every memory sooooo saccarine syrupy overkill... we get it, Butler looks better than he did in his first foray well over 15yrs ago... thought Mom was too bitter in the you will always be alone and this memorial project was a waste, geez, thanks for the support in only her FIRST year of grieving, glad she got over her absolute love of her life in less than a year, bravo! and seems like the only thing they all do is go out and party, guess to show off her shoes???  Marie Antoinette did the same thing with less spectacular results, but hey this is 2008, so when someone has their health, a good business, friends and close relationship with her daughter I am sposed to just fall to pieces when she can't have everything?? ack.... I did find the film with many redeeming qualities, given how much I enjoy Hills, Gerry, Kathy, Harry, Gina, hmmmm, Lisa I can do without..... esp. the trip to the Green Isle, wow, thanks for those visuals, mostly all attractive men, PTL, and the happy ending was quaint finishing touch to the last letter, and yeah the tongue lashing at the harpie in the real estate deal was theee best!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|All that the program does, my brain needs. The OCR feature is really helpful as I store pictures of  flip charts from seminars. Ability to have data on the computer or phone is a big benefit.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is a great interactive game with multiple ways to play it and it sure isnt a waste of space in my kindle
B000V656X4|5.0|I love this album.  It was one of my first albums from Columbia House back in the 80s.  Played it over and over on my Walkman.<br />(Dang, I'm old.)<br />This music still makes me smile.  Love the synthesizers and harmonies.
B008XG1X18|4.0|loveing every second of this app. took way to long to get up and running but it's here now. it does seem to take longer to open than other apps but works fine once it's opened. fix the speed and I'd give it a 5.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I hate it updated by itself and it wont let me login<br /> hate they need to redo the app. because it doesn't work I and.now i hate the app . they need to fix it.  cant even go online. and go on twitter. I know my pass it wont let me sign in. at all don't get it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This is a so so book. Yes there are some twist and turns but the writing itself is so so.
B009329ZF2|4.0|If you were expecting a dramatic enactment of the Battleship boardgame, what's wrong with you?  Who would watch that?  This was exactly what it's supposed to be - exciting, action-packed, full of explosions, and if you can go ahead and suspend a substantial amount of disbelief, a rollicking good time.  If you wanted Hamlet, you wouldn't even be looking at the reviews of this movie.  Look at the picture - does this look like Academy-award winning drama to you?  The romance is contrived and cheesy, the acting is stretched, the characters are stereotypes.  So?  If you think you're gonna like this, you're right.  Grab a beer/wine/cocktail or two and enjoy yourself.
B001O1O71C|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was one of those hard-to-put-down, quick-read books.  The author did a great job writing the book from a young boy's innocent and niave perspective.  It puts a different spin on the reader's perspective of an atrocious period in history.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am a puzzle lover and this is my favorite puzzle app! The colors and pictures are perfect! I would highly recommend this app to any puzzle lover!
B0058Z4NR8|1.0|Much too wordy and repetitive.  He could have got across the key ideas with enough examples to back up his arguments with less than half the words.  I found the constant repetition produced a feeling of \\"get on with it\\" in me.  There's no doubt in my mind that the presence, or lack, of stable institutions has much to do with the success or failure of countries, but he overdoes the argument.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Super fun time playing this game. Why not give it a try! A great mind challenge! You will love it!
B0090EKRKU|1.0|Watch Horton Hears a Who or How The Grinch Stole X-Mas. They have more heart than this film. Expected more from this film. It didn't do Dr. Seuss' story justice. Or here is a novel idea? Buy the book. The sell it on Amazon.com
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Interesting story with many twists. Some parts dragged a bit (an effective strategy by the author) while other sections you wanted to continue forever. Great character development and how a once tragic experience can be resolved.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got bored with this game on my phone after getting to 5000 coins and level 110 but it IS  a fun game.  I love coin dozer games irl, too, of course.  The trick is laying your coins in stacks so they all pour over the side when a big coin drops.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this. i have to make myself shut it off! too many things i want to look at and do and see!
B00992CF6W|5.0|although it isn't the computer version but it IS THE BEST APP EVER MADE FOR ON THE GO IT IS SO FUN WHEN ON MULTIPLAYER.  IT IS WORTH THE SEVEN DOLLARS GET IT NOW NOW NOW
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interestingly written.  Keeps you in suspense throughout.  However, I was a little disappointed in the ending but I still recommend it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I wish that u would add the other coin dozer's games<br />also I wish that the getting coins was as hard or as long as it is
B0087HT36U|4.0|Fun game, kinda like angry birds with a different spin on it. New levels would be fun. Tries hard to get you to spend money but beatable without buying anything
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm currently reading book 2 and can't put it down! Truly a good read and I highly recommend it :)
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Creative, colorful, engaging, AWESOME! Gorgeous , Myst like scenery ; relaxing music. Perfect puzzles , not overwhelming , with perfect hint system if you do get stuck. Would love to see these designers try an ancient historical theme, or use their talents for educational programs. Thank you for this little Gem!
B005IQZB14|5.0|The book lets me live Cheryl's experience vicariously.  Loved it!  Want to read more of her experiences.  I hope she is writing as I write this.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It is obvious why these books ar e so popular! very gripping and you really get involved with the characters.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book satisfied my need for a true story, scientific history, and a personal experience. I'm not sure if everyone would appreciate the science in the book, but it was fascinating. We often take or granted the medical technology  that we have available to us now, but here you learn how Henrietta's cells helped a lot of it come into being. Amazing. Her story made everything seem so personal and severed as a reminder that we are all part of science.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Pardon the play on the Batman quote, but that was a great movie, amiright?<br /><br />Anyway, Born and Raised was a slightly different side of John Mayer than we are used to. He took a risk on this CD, which is admirable. He donned a Neil Young getup, grew out his hair and picked up an acoustic guitar for a few songs. John wears many hats on this album. The folky sounding headliner \\"Born and Raised\\" was a nice simple song. The kind of song that sounds like it could have been recorded on a country porch after a southern meal, watching the sun sink below the valley. He puts on his trio hate with the bluesy, \\"Something like olivia, and has a few throwbacks to our the John Mayer we know and love with songs like, Shadow Days. Personally, I love what he did with, \\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967.\\" This is John's wildcard song, but he makes it believable with his wonderful song writing. It's his homage to following your heart, even if it leads you on a path opposite to what your loved ones expect.<br /><br />Great CD! Pick it up.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|The music is moving and has an amazing beat...love it and cant wait for more :)I already have Continued Silence so did end up with a couple duplicates on the Night Visions but that is ok.... Bleeding Out is a favotite for sure...
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I love this album. It's wonderfully sung and reachs into your soul. I've enjoyed all Ray's albums but this one is my favorite, I put it on often when I just want to relax.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very cool app its amazing how much stuff you didnt know you had an interest in until you start looking thru the app. Thanks again
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was absolutely incredible. The amount of bravery this book contains is overpowering and the fight for survival is just saddening. I can't recommend this book enough. It should be required reading for anyone looking to join the military especially the elite forces.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|Wow such a great movie. The transfer looks great. And the sound is awesome. Shipped very fast. Thanks again. Love movies on bluray
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|This is not a very good movie.  Perhaps if one had read the book, it would make more sense.  But I have not read the book and so all I saw was kids killing kids and two kids win, just in time for a second movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app works great on the fire! I've had no problems. when trying to use pinterest before the app it took too long to load and wad very difficult to pin, now it's set up great for the fire. best app I have
B00063EMJ6|3.0|I agree with Evil Lincoln that someone as prolific as Neil Young deserves a 2-CD greatest hits compilation.  The total absence of Buffalo Springfield hits is a glaring omission, as well as the title track from \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.\\"  The liner notes state that his \\"greatest hits\\" are defined by record sales, airplay, and download history.  Perhaps the problem is copyright ownership...I don't know.  There certainly are other CSN&Y hits, as well, that deserve inclusion with Young's greatest hits.  From a sonic standpoint, I also found that the first 3 tracks on this CD from the \\"Everybody Knows...\\" album could have been remastered better.  There's obnoxious tape hiss that could have been eliminated.  I have the \\"Everybody Knows...\\" CD, and there's no tape hiss on it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because it is mind controlling. When you start to play you can't stop. I just love this game so much!
B00000D9TQ|4.0|This is a good compilation of Phil Collins hits...but not great.  I mean, how can you not include \\"Don't Lose My Number\\" from this anthology?  It's one of Collins' best songs ever...certainly better than \\"Sussudio\\" from the same album.  But there are other songs on this CD I'd rather see replaced.  Though why not just add a 17th track.  As a Greatest Hits CD, this one missed the mark...if only slightly.  So, I'm giving it 4 stars, instead of 5.
B0086700CM|1.0|gosh such a great game but untill lugs get fixed one star is wat i give it right now- a waste of time
B0094KF4WG|5.0|I have read a number of similar Special Forces books - a number written \\"off the cuff\\" with no real thought or research carried out prior to writing or publication of the subject matter. This book is enlightening - no bragging of 'I did this','I am' etc; Appears honest and factual against recent similar comments and articles. Loved the book, finished quite quickly and recommend to anyone.<br />One does not have to be an ex Military person to understand what occured here or the lead up to the final event.
B007N85POS|5.0|My grandchildren love it. It keeps them occupied for hours. It is amazing that a three and four year old can operate it so well.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Phillipa Gregory does it again! I loved that she really showed what could possibly have happened on the other side of the \\"White Queen\\". I would have liked her to go more into the two missing princes from the tower(possibly another book???)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a solid game that showed up in the FAOD. I played the original game and liked it as well. Some levels are very tricky and require a lot of thought. The music is very soothing as well. This game is worth the purchase even if it is not free.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Amazing 5 Stars all around, beautiful sentence structure. What a great book. Now on to the next one. Loving this series!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I am enjoying this game quite a bit, and as the title says it is an excellent sequel to an already great game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So it doesn't matter if you have no writing talent what so ever, it just has to be the 'shock and awe' of moral decay.  The book was shallow in its story line, written to desensitize a public with an already crumbling moral line between the acceptable and unacceptable.  I can't blame the author for writing the trash.  It's more the fault and responsibility of an ignorant public that gets duped into reading it, pass it to their friends and then tell themselves that they are good people of faith and character. Disgusting at best,  a moral plague at worst.  Wake up, people. Remember, what's permissible isn't always right or good.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Graphics..story..entertaining..Big Fish has done an awesome Job! Can't wait for the next part.The Ghosts of Maple Creek is one of the best games I've played. Good storyline and lots to do.Thanks Big Fish!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|If you like 3 of a kind game this is great. With your winning from your score you can decorate your tank and buy your fish. To me this help to keep the game interesting and fun. I own the game on another device and this is why I wanted it for the Kindle. Hope you enjoy it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book back in 2003. This book should be issued to every teenager who does not fit in a crowd or that feels left behind. I can't tell you how many times that I would pick up this book when my life got rough or I was feeling down and read it cover to cover. It's an amazing story with the music background that is in this book. The characters in book were easy to understand and made the book what it became. I absolutely LOVE this book.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This program is worth less than I paid for it - and I got the free version. It stopped working after 12 pictures. It won't let me erase it and reload it. It won't let me reboot it. The help page was no help. It's a shame because the game was fun when I could play it.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|My kids loved this movie.  I thought it was very current with the happenings of today and had a great message.  I give a 4 out of 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun the best part is that it has 101 games grate game so try it lol
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Every woman needs a Christian Grey in her life at some point! What an incredible story line, with an even better ending. Once you have read them all.<br />The explicit sex scenes were a definite turn on, my husband is very happy that I am reading these books.  I would say all women old and young should have a read.<br />Looking forward to the movies!!!
B005LAII94|5.0|I just cant believe some people rate this movie so low. One review even called it the worst of 2012. Wow, they must be on the conservetive side of the spectrum. This film was great, good plot, wild sex, hot women,humor, action and a surprise ending. Trust me , you will like it!!!
B00932A2MC|4.0|I liked this movie. I watched the streamed version from amazon. It was exciting and fast paced and fun to watch.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Its ok. Best RPG I have found so far on the Kindle. No story though. Basically a time waster. Requires you to give a rating for updates. That is the most annoying thing.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This book is exceptional.  What is so great about this book along with all of Daniel Pink's books is the fact that it has simple, easy to understand ideas.  Daniel Pink has a real gift for not only keeping things simple, but also to tell them in a way that entertains you so it is an enjoyable process.<br /><br />The concepts of intrinsic vs. extrinsic rewards are extremely valuable and I have used them in my conversations and day-to-day life regularly.  In addition to this great resource of information, Daniel Pink also points out other resources to check into if you like what you read.  Definitively worth a look.
B007R41E8O|3.0|no complaints for the price  just. 99.  does need a few more instructions.  takes  a little while to figure out how things work.
0062124293|5.0|I loved this book!  It is hilarious and brutally honest. I just read Vagina and then The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf, both honest and thought provoking books as well, but so serious and a little depressing.  How To Be A Woman came up when I looked at the \\"people who bought this also bought that\\" and it was a great book to follow Wolf's work.  They basically are talking about the same issues, but Caitlin's book is so funny and uplifting to read, it makes me feel hopeful for the future of feminism.  I am a feminist, and have been a strident one since before I was a woman, and I have never read anything so positive about our path before.  I especially love when she writes that, by her calculation, we're on the 5th wave of feminism, and that by the time the 5th wave rolls in, it's the tide coming in.  Fantastic!  The only problem I have with this book is that it is really raunchy.  I'm a raunchy gal myself, so I loved it, but it makes me hesitate to give it to all my girlfriends, lest they realize what a dirty girl I am!
B005BQNC44|2.0|Although you feel devastated by what happened, the story just seems to drone on and on. I do not think it is at all well written and certainly did not hold my attention. There are just too many unanswered questions and unexplained events.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|disappointed.  I have always loved reading his books but this one was very disappointing. I will<br />wait to see what he writes next, hopefully better.

B004LROUNG|3.0|...of a lawyer make me glad I was an engineer.  If I had to choose one word to describe this story, from an author whose work I have enjoyed over the years, I'm afraid it would have to be \\"boring\\". It did not have to be this way, the material was potentially interesting: Young Harvard trained lawyer, with beautiful young wife, leaves $300,000 a year boring corporate law job in such a depressed state that he ends up in a bar, gets smashed and finds himself on the door step of a law office run by a couple of shyster ambulance chasers, a sharp black secretary (who holds the place together), and a dog. These guys, a recovering divorced alcoholic, and a would-be-divorced grouch, glad to have the prestige of a Harvard man on the staff, take him into their little office in Southwest Chicago.  A case then falling in their lap involves big pharmaceutical company and an anti -cholesterol drug which seems to be causing heart attacks.  From here, to me, the story drags, gets bogged down, offering few exciting moments and almost no surprises. A side story about a Burmese couple whose grandson is brain damaged from a lead containing toy, rises up to save the day after the Big Pharma case fizzles. The young lawyer wins a settlement from this case, rescuing the little law firm and allowing him to open his own office, during the course of which, though another side story, he wins a judgment against a company hiring Burmese workers for less than minimum wage. It was hard for me to get my teeth into this series of short stories or get very excited about them (even though the author tried to add some excitement when the young lawyer punched out a law blogger for blogging that his wife was a bimbo) - maybe if I were a lawyer I would have found it all more fascinating - or if it had been developed differently. I was impressed with the amount of research the young lawyer was able to do and the number of supporting documents he was able to pull together by himself with no paralegal or law clerk. How he did this was not explained, however, but there definitely was no crazy \\"Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\\" to help,  with either his research or the story interest.clerk.

B001I45UFC|4.0|This classic is an enjoyable read.  My dyslexic students are motivated to read it. So I am rereading it.  I sure enjoy having it on the Kindle so when I am waiting I can easily access it.
B008I3R2VG|4.0|As with all the Killers/Flowers albums I needed to listen it 3 times to start liking it. It is closer to \\"Flamingo\\" than to the rest of The Killers albums, but still very different. It is not what people (and I) expected.
B003PJ6UHA|3.0|I appreciated a different kind of opinion about physics subject matter.  I'm interested in learning about physics and the sciences in general.  There are, however, some parts that are intensely autobiographical.  While he ties some of it into what he's talking about, I could've done without such large swaths of autobiography.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|I can see a good improvement on my mental addition. I wish they had this game with subtraction and multiplication and division. And three digit numbers. I'd pay 5 bucks for it. And if it had better graphics and music I'd pay 6.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is without a doubt the best book of its genre I've ever read. I totally in agreement with the author's premise that this was a story that needed to be told.  I also sincerely hope that the author's community can fully come to terms with that.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|works as advertised great free game. well see.... forced a review a lil early to tell. truth.<br /> blab blab blab blah
B008393Q2O|5.0|This is a deceptively simple, or perhaps I should say deceptively powerful notepad. The filter and search feature provide the organizational power; you can make checklists, set reminders -- there is quite a lot of power under the hood, so to speak, but it is very easy to use as a basic notepad as well. But what I really appreciate is the look and feel of this app. Notes are large and easily legible. It is simply a pleasure to use, and a terrific bargain at the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My 11-year-old grandson urged me to read this book.  I had heard of it and the movie but was not interested until he started telling me about it. I had never read a story quite like The Hunger Games and was very pleased that it was so entertaining.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest, I need to learn, what to do after I have pinned,  where are my boards kept?  I need a class I think. Pinterest has it all, my favotite app.I need to have my boards in one place.I know its me, not the app. I someone could walk me though.,  it would be much appreciated.There's something I'm missing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am reading the triology with my 11-year-old grandson.  We both enjoyed Catching Fire immensely.  The author is a good writer for both younger people and adults.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|The human spirit is as relevant today as then.  The great struggle of the working poor and the money motives of business that take advantage of the desperate.  This book must have led to many new laws that protect people.  A review of his work is really superfluous.
0525953728|5.0|Mark Owen describes all that preceded the operation that finally took Osama Bin Laden permanently from committing and inflicting terror on the US. It does get things straight and corrects all of the erroneous press releases at the time after the operation. A lot of wrong information was given to the public, and quite frankly we were inundated with newspaper articles, tv network coverage that was quite conflicting at times. Mark Owen clarifies a lot of this and subsequently shows us vividly how our elite American forces go about encountering and neutralizing evil in the world. I forever give thanks to all our forces for the past and continue sacrifice endured.<br />Vincent
0061743526|4.0|I'm in the middle of this classic right now. I see why it is a classic. Its tale of racial segregation is one to stand in one's mind for a lifetime. I am getting a feel for what this novel is about. Wish there was another. I guess you can't duplicate a classic. Harper Lee's only work of publication but still upon reading is a masterpiece that should never be banned but taught to people why the content is wrong. Why certain terms for people were used. Never this book taken off the shelves via censorship and there rules that in some ways make points that set good standards. Some rules are bad. This book deserves not the out of print treatment nor edited cencorship. Morals of this story should be taught to people. Bad morals should have explanations as to why. This novel lives on in a glory need not disturbed by the senseless ones. This classic book will always stand the test of time. Mockingbird o' mockingbird live on forever.
B0063GORYU|5.0|when i am bored, its a very addicting way to pass the time.  I am disabled and so enjoy immersing myself in a nice game of spider.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story set in a post apocalyptic society. Howey tells an incredible story of man struggling to survive in a silo underground. Really recommend this series to everyone.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A handy guide to have if you are thinking of publishing. Formatting can drive one mad,but this how-to helps a great deal.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Seige Hero is a cool game you get to throw rocks and fire and you get to burn and break things
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Read all five books from \\"Game of Thrones\\" and excited to read book six which we hear might be out soon? Hopefully? The writer keeps you on the edge of your seat, has chapters dedicated to each player in the game. Is educational, exciting and captivating. Love it!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read books before in a week, but never in 2 days until I read Safe Haven! It was THAT good!
B008VBYN80|1.0|game never opens. tried uninstall and reinstall. reboot several times. close all running apps... still nothing. no response from customer support
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Excellent the songs are so wonderful the backup singers are angels and the musicians are so wonderful . I listen to this album 1 to 3 times a week
B006LSZECO|3.0|As you progress thru the beginning of the book, the reader wonders where the plot will bring you because there seems to be something missing, something off. However, later in the book as the plot thickens, I became more interested. However, I was left with little feeling for the husband and less for the wife.  At least the husband should have been a more sympathetic character.<br /><br />I think the characters were not fully developed and I felt that I was reading \\" a movie of the week\\".  The ending was supposed to show a psychological twist, but instead I was left extremely disappointed in the characters and with the book as a whole.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I love the album.  Every song is worth listening to many times.  I am really glad I got the album and I love the band.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok first of all people say that this game doesn't work on kindle fire but that's bull crap its awesome on kindle the only thing that doesn't work is playing online
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great story about how the CIA Analysts and the Navy Seals took out one of the biggest threats to America Osama Bin Laden
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was skeptical at first about the book, but I dont pay much attention and want to judge for myself.  I was hooked from the first chapter.  I was able to read the book in just over an hour i couldnt put it down.  The book was well written and very thouroly researched.  I have friends that are into the BDSM lifestyle and they even agree.  I fell in love with the book and bough the other 2 about a week later and that was holding off for me.  Ana's charachter caught me from moment one and then Christain OMG!!!!! Loved the books loved the series.  If you use your imagination you can actually put yourself in Ana's shoes or even if your a guy you can put yourself in Christains shoes.  I hope that the rumors are true and this gets made into a movie that would be freaking hot.  of course it may come with a X rating but thats ok.  this is one i will spend money on to see.
B000002C2E|5.0|Dylan's recordings are either great or ahem...so-so This is outstanding. Love the instrumentation and production. Dylan's gravelly voice has aged like da finest bourbon spirits. I also have 2 give honorable mention for da other catz involved in dis musical journey,epiphany to da earz: Augie Meyers, Luther Dickinson, Daniel Lanois~all geniuses in their own right. Zimmerman has  done his best work when he has good musical foils around him. This is the good Dylan stuff, not the half baked demo style stuff, which isn't bad, but is just kind of forgettable (ie a lot of these early acoustic demo recordings that populate the famed Bootleg Serier type releases)
B001JI7WTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie because it has real adventure in it, where the focus is on the adventure, not the tight clothes of the female or the inappropriate language of most of the cast.  It shows real male bonding between a teen and his uncle, and overcoming fear.  My favorite phrase in the whole movie is when Brenden Fraser looks at his nephew just before they are about to go down a very dark tunnel and says:  \\"Cowboy up!\\"  The nephew then squares his shoulders and goes in.  Everything in that expression sets the tone for what that boy is going to have to do over and over.  It makes a great family movie!!
B000008FNB|4.0|I especially love the Peter Green era disc with all the stuff dating from the beginning of the band in the sixties up to the Bob Welch/Danny Kirwan era and my faves are I Believe My Time Ain't Long, Albatross, Rattlesnake Shake, Green Manalishi, Oh Well, Station Man, and an unrelease Danny Kirwan tune called Trinity, which outshines alot of the other stuff featured on here from the same era.. The other two discs are no slouches either, featuring an awesome extended mix of I'm So Afraid by Lindsay Buckingham. I'm so Afraid is my case in point of Lindsay being an underrated, awesome guitar player. The Rumours cuts on here appear albeit in remixed versions or some type of alternate extended versions (ie Gold Dust Woman). Used copies are for under ten bucks and yes, there are a few snoozers on here, i admit, but not enough to diminish da power of Mac when the Mac machine was firing on all cylinders.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Just started watching about 3 weeks ago because of people I work with all talking about season 5. I am now up to season 4 and cant stop. I would recomend watching the series strongly! I did start with season 1 episode 1 , and would recomend anyone who has never watched it, to start from the beginning.It is well worth every viewing moment.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|If Bob Dylan has proven anything on his 35th studio album it's that hummable tunes with memorable melodies never really go out of fashion. He plays with a cluster of genres on Tempest that are in most cases older than he is, but resists coming off like an out of touch septuagenarian instead soaring like a newly invigorated elder statesmen. Whether he's balancing country and swing on opener \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" or paying homage to Muddy Waters blue's on \\"Early Roman Kings\\", he makes these well-worn styles sound timeless and charming here.<br /><br />Despite the inviting feel of most of these tracks, Dylan's no holds barred mixture of violent imagery and black Humour has got a lot of critics calling Tempest his darkest album yet. The slew of songs on here that deal with grim subject matter's also add to the credence of such an epithet, \\"Long and Wasted Years\\" is about a bitter divorce, the title track graphically pays tribute to the sinking of the Titanic and then there's a trio of murder and suicide in \\"Tin Angel\\". The bleakness on Tempest doesn't feel too overwhelming though, as his bourbonated Father Christmas growl gives these songs a warmth and humanity that creates an intriguing juxtaposition if anything here.<br /><br />Ever since Mr Zimmermans critical renaissance began on Time Out of Mind, people have been claiming that each subsequent record he's released is up their with his absolute best work, so it's no suprise that this album is gathering similar plaudits. personally i think it's a good record rather than a great one, with the overly long \\"Tempest\\" and mawkishness of \\"Roll On John\\" being two obvious offenders that drag the record down somewhat. Tempest is still a considerable achievement from a man who's entered into his sixth decade of releasing music though and anybody who's a fan of Bob Dylan would be doing themselves a real disservice by overlooking it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been a long-time follower of Stephen King's work, and 11/22/63 rates with \\"The Shining\\", \\"Christine\\", and other writings of his.  Definitely worth a read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|At times, I found the book dragged a bit, but I'm glad I stuck with it. There are surprises along the way that provide insight to deviant thinking. I have heard that there is talk of making a movie based on the book, and I would definitely want to see it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|When I got my new phone it said I wont work on my phone out of the google market.Came to amazon. Com.and it let me download it. It has worked great.  Thanks amazon
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Has been a blessing to get this Bible, now my husband is able to see Gods words. Thank you and God Bless
B002MCJZHS|5.0|Where did these guys come from?  Who outs out a debut album this complete and polished.<br /><br />There is nothing to not like.  Awesome female and male vocals that work together or separately.  Good grooves with sparse beats.  Moody background that creates a good tension.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Excellent, one of the most enjoyable show I've ever watched... Acting is superior, costumes perfect and nothing can even compare to the landscape and countrysides beautiful.
B002AR9YPI|5.0|This is the first Grizzly Bear album I purchased.  I kept hearing about these guys and downloaded the album for $5 from Amazon mp3....the best $5 I've ever spent.  Every track on the album is great.  I like the fact that the songs aren't conventional and go places you don't expect.  Even after repeated listens the songs still keep their freshness.  If you are a fan of Grizzly Bear, you surely have this album.  If you were like me, and heard of these guys, DO IT.  Take the plunge, buy this album and do your ears a favor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. I felt like I was truly in the story:) looking forward to reading the next book!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|By far the best book of the series. Could not put it down. Read it in one day.  Love love it!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the best game in the world. my brouther has it on his xbox and we both like it. this version is a bit diferent outlet bit but still the best game ever. if you like kiling monsters and bilding houses this is your game. I for one think it is grate and youbshould get it.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|at level 90 and it's still fun, a must download!!! if you have 2 minutes or an hour, fun little time game.
B0086DBE62|2.0|Julia Roberts who I enjoy as an actor killed her character for me with the in and out faulty accent from no where. Though the story is pretty good I felt it was inconsistant and often tedious rythmically. The humor was also often more painful than funny. I enjoyed the minor characters the most!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was my first book read written by Blake Crouch...I enjoyed this book and have already ordered another of his books,\\"Run\\".
B006OOHYIC|5.0|very well laid out game , fun and challenging many many levels , very nice sequill to quell would buy it if amazon hadnt offered it free .
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great story, the final book of the continuing saga of the HUNGER GAMES trilogy, \\"MOCKINGJAY\\" held my attention all the way through as did the first two books, \\"HUNGER GAMES\\" and \\"CATCHING FIRE\\".  Collins is truly a gifted writer with the ability to keep the reader \\"glued\\" to the storyline.  All three are real page turners. Great read. I'd recommend \\"MOCKINGJAY\\" to anybody who's read \\"HUNGER GAMES\\" and \\"CATCHING FIRE\\". Very entertainiing!
B006HTUZ1C|3.0|blocks don't flip when tapped and sometimes slide too far when dragged. I did like the math aspect pf this game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Awesome product.  Very easy to use.  Works in different applications syncs between all my devices. Set up very easy and started using right away.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I replaced the peltier module in a Cuisinart wine cooler .  The most important step is not only having the polarity correct, but, using the proper heat-sink material.  Arctic Silver is fantastic and easy to apply to both sides of the peltier wafer. I highly recommend it. Amazon was quick with my order, and I would use them again.
B005MMY534|4.0|Great storyline - sexy - like the Tudors- nice scenery- the lead ladies r hot too - buy it buy it buy it
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!!!  I read about a dozen other reviews before I figured out how to leave one myself. I cannot believe anyone would only give this a 3 star rating. Seriously? It was great. An emotional rollercoaster! I grew up with this story and honestly it was like seeing it yanked me back to childhood when my mother read me this story. But her version was the Disney Golden Book. As a true movie lover you will appreciate this next: Watching this movie took my breath away in the same fashion as Pan's Labyrinth. It was like the first time I saw Legend. I'm 38 now and didn't recall the story well enough to make the movie too familiar, so I was able to thoroughly enjoy it!  (My boyfriend brought it home and I was reluctant to watch it,  we were both tired and didn't want to invest a few hours in a movie. So we threw it in and,  like, an hour into it we were both riveted to the couch. PLEASE Do not let other reviews ruin this for you. EVERY actor was great. Wardrobe deserves an Oscar. Only one thing I feel like mentioning...Chris Hemsworth was the true image of the Woodsman, but, man,  his accent was slipping left and right...not enough to ruin anything. I'm still going to watch it again. And again.
B0041OT9W6|4.0|the diary of a young girl by anne frank was a wonderful book. actually, there is no one-word answer for how much i liked the book. its historical, interesting, true, and just plain wonderful. my bff said that she loved the book so much!she said that she co0uld read it over and over again. i liked it, but my friend LOVED it.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|This album is ALL Pink.  If you love her music, you will love this album!  It's real, raw, honest and awesome!  My favorites are Just Give Me A Reason, True Love, and of course Blow Me One Last Kiss.  True Love is so refreshingly REAL, so for anyone who's ever had a relationship like this, you'll understand.  Just Give Me A Reason is also real but in a more heartbreaking way.  Again, if you've ever had any sort of real meaningful relationship, this will resonate with you.  Bravo Pink, another fabulous album, can't wait for the tour!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I went to Target to get the CD because I couldn't resist hearing the exclusive tracks.  I love the whole album, but now Run and Is This Thing On are my new favorites! I purchased the CD on Amazon, but it's worth going to buy it at Target to get the extra 4 songs!  It's a wonderful album, I heard somewhere that Pink said she knows it's sort of all over the place, but that's what makes it so good!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Its weird but nice and i hope it works. I like programs that give progress of my machines and i can appreciate this one. But, like i said i just hope it works.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Ran across this album after discovering DEVO's recent \\"Don't Rook Rack Me Bro\\" single. I have always been a fan of their geeky electronic groove and this album does not disappoint. Purchase the entire album and make it the Deluxe version (available in MP3 only), it is well work getting the bonus tracks .<br /><br />From \\"Fresh\\" to \\"What We Do\\" with biting lyric lines like \\"Eating and breeding and pumping gas, cheeseburger cheeseburger, do it again.\\" to \\"Human Rocket\\", \\"Step Up\\", \\"Later is Now\\", \\"March On\\" and \\"Watch Us Work It\\" there really is Something for Everybody.<br /><br />One of my favorites \\"Knock Boots\\" with lyric lines like \\"The goons talk, the creeps arrive -- The suits laugh as they rob you blind -- Bigger Ballers and self-appointed cops -- In attack dog mode, they just won't stop -- Feelin' really low, then I start to wonder how to stop myself from goin' under -- It flashes super-bright, I realize the surest way to prove we're still alive -- Knock boots until you die now -- You never know when they're gonna pull the plug, So knock boots until the end\\" Simply a fantastic song!<br /><br />The real question is how come I did not hear about this album until 2 years after it was first released? It really should get more attention than it has. I would put it in my top ten list of favorite albums. Just when I was thinking, that current music does not hold a candle to what has come before, in comes DEVO to prove me wrong. Thanks so much for this album guys, it is getting heavy rotation in my workshop!<br /><br />March On!
B00992CF6W|5.0|so much better then block story I have minevraft for my Xbox,Pc,ipod,kindle its BEAST I would buy it if I was you.
0062197258|3.0|This book took me about three times longer than other books to finish because parts of it just went on and on without seeming to have progress. To be honest I almost quit it half way through but I wanted to stick with it. I lost interest often but I felt compelled to go on. I wanted Catherine to have her moment of victory. The storyline was brutal to be sure, yet Catherine's quick recovery seemed off once she started therapy.<br /><br />Most disappointing to me was the ending when she finally has to face off against him. It felt anti-climactic...almost over before it began. It lacked the \\"tour de force of suspense\\" that the synopsis promised. That scene should have lasted a while and and have the readers biting their fingernails! A missed opportunity to be sure.<br /><br />I think overall what was lacking for me was her attraction to Lee in the first place. There was never a time where I thought he was just such an awesome guy in the beginning that would make her so attached to him. He was a turd from day 1 so I didn't see the charisma. I didn't find it bad...just..ok.<br /><br />Remember Sleeping With The Enemy? That guy made you want to crap your damn pants! He was a mental mind freak! This guy...I don't know...just \\"meh\\".
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is great. I am on it all of the time. the is a wide selection of categories that are fun to look at

0385738773|4.0|James Dashner's third novel in the Maze Runner series brings us back to Thomas, Minho and Newt, three former dwellers of the Maze.  It's the final journey to stop Wicked from the extremes of their planing to find a cure for the 'Flare' - a disease that is taking over humans and making them act in unexpected ways.<br /><br />Thomas still has his role as leader, but this time for a handful of people who chose not to get their memories back.  I kind of understood why he did that.  No matter how many times Teresa said Wicked was good, I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />Even in this third book, relationships changed in ways that were expected, but in other cases not at all. It really felt like an end of an era, like saying goodbye to an exciting family friend.<br /><br />The book held a lot of surprises, well for me at least, and a lot of sadness and bittersweet moments as well.  So much happened in this book that there was never a dull moment.  It was full of action and reveals, although, that being said, we never found out any more about what had been discovered with their blueprint.  But, that's another story.<br /><br />Even though, we got a taste of 'Cranks' in the last book, I never truly realized how horrible it was until I read more scenes about them.  Their lives would have been horrible and I could understand why they wanted to find a cure so badly.<br /><br />The book settled a lot of questions for me and, on the whole, I was happy with the outcome.  And, I still found this series better and more satisfying than the Hunger Games.  I'm going to miss Thomas, Newt, and Minho.<br /><br />Now for my rating:-<br /><br />4 out of five stars
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|the game dilivers what it promises coins for wasting time at the bus stop and when you cant sleep cant wait for all the prizes
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|AWEsumly fun! Recommend for all ages! Gotta love math, though.<br /><br />I do wish there was a way to slow it down more for my 1st grader....
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book. Mitch Album never fails to amaze me. Love all his books, but I think this is the best yet.
B004UID2LC|4.0|this app is very good if you have a youtube account and you subscribe to someone because then it it emails you when they make another video and with this app you can download the video and not have to pause it and rewind it. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has a youtube account. the only problem is that if you turn it off while a video is downloading, it doesn't download all the way.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I just saw this movie today and I found it to be one of the best movies of 2012 so far.  I recommed this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it in theaters like myself.  It is worth the money.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game.  What a \\"big kid\\" I am. For a senior citizen this game keeps the mind and senses sharp. My younger family love it even more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so good! Seriously if you watched the movie... Read the books! I'm on catching fire right now and they are sooo addicting!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can not believe this game was free. I love it although it stresses me out when I loose and the challenging enemy pigs laugh at me. It is a fun game and very addictive.
B009329ZF2|1.0|Life is to short to waste on this turkey of a movie. The action was stiff,cgi lacking and the content shallow. Nuff said.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book back in highschool, i hate books but this book is probably the only book that ever held my attention.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love pinterest!  its awesome! the hair and beauty section is sooo amazing!!! gahhh i lovee it(: great app.
B008OTTRXU|3.0|I feel almost guilty that, being a member of the over-50 set, I too was sucked in by the catchy, bouncy spell of \\"Call Me Maybe.\\" Searching through some downloads, I was impressed by Jepsen's songwriting skills on \\"Tiny Little Bows\\" and \\"This Kiss.\\" I even enjoyed Jepsen's duet with Owl City.<br />Listening to the entire album in one sitting is where doubt and eventual boredom creep. The same manufactured dance beats that make you run away screaming from Katy Perry and Lady Gaga albums show up on almost every song on \\"Kiss.\\" By the time you get to the otherwise endearing \\"Guitar String / Wedding Ring,\\" you want to seriously injure whoever it is that insists on placing that hollowing thumping sound that passes for a drum track in so many places where it doesn't belong.<br />Jepsen is a talented songwriter and has a bright future IF she can escape the manufactured dance pop production that makes you want to eject \\"Kiss\\" before it finishes. Jepsen does not deserve to be tossed into the Bieber-Gaga-Perry-Spears ashcan of disposable music. The question is whether she is willing to throw away teen pop stardom and the megabucks that go with it in favor of serious music.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent post-apocalyptic story with intertwined characters.<br />Very well-written; the author provides enough detail to make characters and situations interesting, but not so much that the reader questions the \\"science\\" or \\"facts\\" behind the story.<br />As with every great story, I was sad to turn the last page -- the author left me wanting to know more about this world and the characters that inhabit it.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|What an interesting mix of math and tetris! I hope the update in the future to add subtraction, multiplication and division.  Great fun for any age, worth a try. No issues on the kindle fire.
B0047JSJEY|5.0|This, the debut album (Asylum 5054) for the L.A.-based group that would, 26 years later, be inducted into the R&R Hall Of Fame, came out in June 1972 and quickly established them as a coming force in the genre. Recorded in London, England at Olympic Studios, and produced by Glyn Johns, it would reach # 22 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts and produce their first three Billboard Pop Hot 100 singles. It would also one day be listed at # 374 in Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time.<br /><br />The first of the singles, Take It Easy, also hit the charts in early June and would peak some weeks later at # 12 on both the Hot 100 and the Adult Contemporary (AC) charts on Asylum 11005 b/w the non-album track, Get You In The Mood (one day that hit would be listed by the R&R Hall Of Fame among the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock `N' Roll). A few months later, in September, Witchy Woman would make its way to # 9 Hot 100 on Asylum 11008 b/w Earlybird from the LP, and by late December they had Peaceful Easy Feeling climbing to # 20 AC and # 22 Hot 100 early in 1973 on Asylum 11013 b/w another album track, Trying.<br /><br />The band members at the time (there would be changes ahead) were lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist Glenn Frey (also slide guitar, keyboards and harmonica), lead vocalist, bass guitarist/guitarist Randy Meisner; lead vocalist, lead guitarist Bernie Leadon (also banjo), and drummer/guitarist/lead vocalist Don Henley.<br /><br />The tracks, with writers shown in brackets, are:<br />Side One<br />1. Take It Easy (Jackson Browne & Glenn Frey) - 3:29 - Glenn Frey lead vocal<br />2. Witchy Woman (Don Henley & Bernie Leadon) - 4:10 - Don Henley lead vocal<br />3. Chug All Night Glenn Frey) - 3:13 - Glenn Frey lead vocal<br />4. Most Of Us Are Sad (Glenn Frey & Randy Meisner) - 3:33 - Randy Meisner lead vocal<br />5.

B000FC1MM8|4.0|My husband and I are avid readers and thoroughly enjoy the \\"Bosch\\" mysteries. We find them current in subject matter.<br />The only \\"complaint\\"[[ASIN:0316614564 The Harry Bosch Novels Volume 2: The Last Coyote, Trunk Music, Angels Flight]] about The Last Coyote is that it seemed to have an abundance of characters and therefore became<br />somewhat confusing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Playing coin dozer whenever I have a few moments. Learning slowly how to finesse the coins to lose fewer points! FUN!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Held your interest through the entire book.  Constantly moving but just cannot get use to language used.  A good read for both men and women.
0385344333|1.0|I'm a huge fan of this author and was so excited that he had wrtten another Jack Reacher novel that I did the unthinkable..I paid full E-price for it. I never do that unless they are from the very best. What a huge disappointment. BORING!!!!!! I  found myself skimming alot of the pages further into the book or just plain skipping them all together. I will certainly download the \\"free sample\\" next time and follow the \\"trust but verify\\" if this author decides to write another. Unfortunate and disappointing!!!!!!!
B004XE0P5E|5.0|This is an amazing album. I am glad I spent my hard earned money on this, it was definitely worth every penny. Best CD I own.
B001KWTBVQ|4.0|Great movie. and costume designs!!! I watched it with my 17 yr old daughter and it was fun, romantic and a happy ending.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Once started it was hard to put down. I would highly recommend<br />this book. In my opinion he did no worse than the \\"clowns\\" in<br />Washington who should know better.
B0082A3IKO|5.0|Every song is great, he is a very talented man.<br />Every body that listens to the CD says the same thing.<br />CAnt wait for his next CD.<br />Scot228
B007OWG3LM|3.0|Don't mind me even when substandard Sigur Ros is majestic. I have been listening Valtari non-stop and I like the album. I just don't think it's Sigur Ros's finest. I think it sounds a lot like Riceboy Sleeps and to support my claim I only have to look at the production credits and there you are Jonsi and Alex co-produced it. I can see this band slowly turning into jonsi's gig which is a pity since everyone of them are great musicians.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book,easy read.tells the real story.of the navy seals job to keep this country safe and free.go seals.the best the navy has to offer.
0345803485|2.0|I gave up reading just under half-way.  The development of the story line was slow, the characters were lacking depth, and the S&M, dominant and submissive made little sense.  Too much waffling by the main female character and the male character had no personality.  Best seller...NOT! I'm glad I read the library copy before wasting my money.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Needed an alarm and all I had was my kindle.  This app was perfect.  It lets you set the song or sound you want to wake up to.  It worked perfectly.  Love it.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|i love this album, this is the one of the best of 2012<br />every song is so great<br /><br />buy it now

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long long time.  It kept up the interest from one page to the other.  I hardly laid the book down from the first page through the entire trilogy.
B004LQEYAG|3.0|This was an ok movie.  It was not up to the hype I heard about it.  I was a little disappointed, I don't think it was worth the rental price.  The best part of the movie was Ted Cassidy.
B00881VLCE|4.0|good but I didn't get some of the puzzles when I downloaded them. it takes a lot of time if you use the small pieces sobits good for taking trips
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I downloaded the YouVersion Bible from Amazon and, after a few miscues getting it loaded on my Kindle, I am ecstatic. I really appreciate the opportunity to read in different versions. I love it that my pastor can post his notes and verses for me to read and then look at again whenever I want to throughout the week. I LOVE the reading plans that are available with daily reminders, opportunities to contemplate what I have read, and even the rewards for completing a plan. I have already shared this with more than a dozen friends and I now highly recommend it to anyone reading this review.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun and well designed. I have played a lot of these and it is great on the physics. would like to see a free coin option though.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was great to read a fantasy scifi with some surprises in it. The sequel books are just as clever.
B0017I1FP8|1.0|I am sure I would have enjoyed this a lot, had I ever received it. I sent an email shortly after ordering saying there was a change of address. Never heard back from the seller. Communication would have been nice, even if it said that the product had already been shipped. Now I don't know where in the world the CD was shipped to. I checked with the apartment complex that it was originally addressed for, and they said they had no record of it ever even arriving. I wish I knew more about what happened, and if it was a more expensive product, I'd press harder for a refund. In this case though, I know just not to shop from this person again.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I am so happy I own the complete series of Daria. This a great funny show. When I watched Daria on tv back in the day I just enjoyed it. Watching it now, years later, and being friends with Cecilia, I feel like I am watching us. We are two close opinionated friends. Who don't make many friend because people think we are mean or grumpy. They just don't get us.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was taken back by the ineptitude of the Seals at first.  I guess I might have been having trouble with the training time ; as the book moves back and forth  between training and deployments.<br /><br />Half way thru the book I was disappointed, and then it be came apparent to me how realistic the book had become.<br /><br />Things just go wrong, and these guys have to overcome those changes and still succeed.<br /><br />The writers took exceptional precaution to not expose any secret  or compromising information; unlike their Commander and Chief.<br /><br />I have even more respect now for the mind set of the type of individual that can become a Seal; as well as a profound respect for what they do and why.<br /><br />Too the point that I am going back and change my rating from a 3 to a 4 star.
0061122416|5.0|Mr. Coelho, I've perceived the notion that you are a \\"romantic gentlemen.\\" By the way you have given the information that Julia Roberts and Bill Clinton read your book; it made it much more interesting from the very beginning. Fatima, she obviously did not know that she had a jewel in her hand. Santiago, was a young man that wanted more in life, besides what was given at home. He pursued his life goal legend in traveling and learning, but he was still naive to the fact that there was going to be hindrances during his journey. He found it an amazed and a well-learned experience that reached his satisfaction in the very end. Love was the greatest gift that caused him to have reached his goal. Bravo!
B000VWLEK2|5.0|Easy download from Amazon, then fire it up and it's Eric (I know, seems like we know each other) at his best.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Interesting plot, enjoyed book, but felt it never reached a level that her other books did. Overall I would recommend this book and author.
B007PFD90G|5.0|This has to be one of the most well written books I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|I not only ordered the book but also purchased the audible book.  After Jon Katz's reference to Call of the Wild in his books, I was interested to see what inspired him.  I kept looking for a happier end for Buc but, unfortunately, it wasn't to be.  I found myself gasping in horror, chapter after chapter, while reading the abuse this poor animal received from his many handlers.  Not for the animal advocate!!
B003VS0CXI|4.0|I loved this movie ever since I first saw it at the drive-in movie theater when my parents took me and my brothers and sister to see it back in 1968.  I bought this two disc disc edition hoping that they had done more than just a plain DVD to Blu-ray transfer, but that is basically what was done with this edition. While the few extras on the Blu-ray disc is nice they could have done so much better, which is why I only gave this classic movie 4 stars.  Aside from that this a great deal for the price.
B003ZDO90G|5.0|Seriously, this author gives me too much pleasure. Think: can't stop reading. Just one more story. I tend not to read many short stories. But Alice Munro has such a talent for describing characters that I get engrossed in their life-be it mundane or exciting-and I HAVE to keep reading. Her writing is superb, especially her use of metaphor. I think I might just have to read all of her work.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love love pintrest have pinned more crafts than I could ever do in my life time....so much fun...only issue is that it does a force close a lot
B00336C3EY|5.0|This is a movie of depth, breadth, and infinite wisdom. It may not be quite as titillatingly funny as the Big Lebowski, but I find it to be more profound and humorous in a  different way.<br /><br />Learn to accept the mystery.  That's one of the themes here.  Another favorite theme is \\"I didn't order Santana Abraxas\\".  I love the theme that life is like getting records from a record club you never joined--really this movie needs to be watched several times to be truly appreciated. I still feel someday it will be a cult classic hit to rival the Big Lebowski (ok maybe not, but I'm hopeful).<br /><br />To me it answers the biggest questions about life more satisfyingly than any other movie or book I've seen (except maybe Ignmar Bergman, but that's heavy man, so heavy). They tackle God, what is life, and how to confront death. They do it in a non-direct Coen-brother fashion, but what did you expect?
B00932A6G4|4.0|I enjoyed it and I found it entertaining. Not the most engaging plot, but it is a decent movie to watch on a rainy Saturday.
B007RP4D5Y|4.0|It's been awhile since I've purchased a 'Metheny' CD.  My last one was \\"We Live Here\\", so that goes to tell you just how long its been.  This CD kind of brings you back to that time period. Its a good CD, but I must admit I missed his pianist \\"Lyle\\".  The piano is missing here, and for me, I would enjoy it better if he were present.
B0058VW36U|4.0|My 3 year old granddaughter talked me in to downloading this on my phone...now I have it on my tablet and Ipod as well.  It is a challenging game and requires some thought to finish each game/level.  My granddaughter loves this game and replays if she doesn't get 3 stars!  The only issue I have is the levels with the short rope are hard to cut and my finger moves the rope when trying to cut it.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This series will have you laughing constantly.  The acting is superb - if you need a lift up, this is it.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Great game but it freezes all the time when switching or restarting levels. Quite annoying having to exit the app and restart.
0812993292|2.0|When Lois Lowry recommended this book on her blog, I immediately downloaded it to my kindle. What a disappointment! The relationship between Harold and his wife is clearly beyond redemption, yet the author manipulates the reader into believing that Harold's \\"pilgrimage\\" will save them. And, of course, it does, but not before making me want to barf. Spoiler alert: the most appalling part of the novel is Harold's reunion with Queenie. She has stayed alive all this time, physically deteriorating and suffering more and more by the minute, and for what?!!! She dies in agony, though of course the reader is led to believe she experiences some sort of miraculous afterlife. Sentimental tripe.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|While I don't really see all the hype about the contents of this book I still enjoyed it. I hate the fact that it ends right in the middle of a story forcing you to buy the next book to finish it. I can't wait to see what else the author comes out with.
B004IK30S2|5.0|Still one of my favorite dumb humor movies. I just love the over-the-top antics and 70's look and feel of the movie. If you are looking for a serious movie, this is NOT for you!
B0083EW97W|4.0|John Mayer is long time favorite of mine, and this album has some of his most terrific music to date. If I have one criticism it is that his musicianship outshines his lyrics in a track or two. But that is really being picky. Overall, this is a very listenable collection of songs, a few of which border on exquisite.
B00555X8OA|4.0|i did not get to read this book yet, because i can not say goodbye yet too my hans falada books; they are so beautiful.<br />i will review 'thinking' as soon as i have read it; but for the moment there is no doubt in my mind that i will like it, because it was highly recommended by my son (and he knows what i like).<br /><br />i am half way now and it is very interesting - shows you a new way of thinking and viewing. it is not a bedtimebook; so progress is slow, because you cannot loose attention for a second.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like it but it takes forever to regenerate the coins unless you set the internal system time forward after running out of coins
B0066W1AZK|5.0|if you wanna play chess this is the app to use. it lets you pick the difficulty so u can play at your own skill level. overall it is a great chess app.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|This CD is awesome. There isn't a bad song on it. I compare it a lot of times to One Republic's \\"Waking Up\\" In the way that both are written very well and both cd's all their songs are great and could be hits. They both are original and different.
B004T2QZL8|2.0|I played this before but irlt was something else called like alchemy or something. then I decided to purchase it and I beat it in two days and it barely kept my attention. I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again. the mini games didn't even make sense. game was too  repetitive. waste of money.
B000FC10MU|1.0|Even though the Kindle edition is linked from the tenth anniversary edition page, it is not the tenth anniversary text.  Great novel, wonderful to read.  But I already own the original version and was specifically looking for the tenth anniversary update.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the game!  it needs no wifi, so it is great for long trips. you can get really addict!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game itself is fun and completely addicting. However once your initial allotment of coins is gone,  you either have to buy more or get one for free every 30 seconds. Uninstalling just for this reason.
B008EQIJQO|5.0|I really enjoyed this film,  it was refreshing to watch something different.  I would recommend this film for anyone looking for a movie to curl up and watch and dream about how things use to be.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not up to the usual Lee Child standard, plot was fairly easily worked out early in  the book.  Still it was Jack Reacher so had to be at least 3 stars.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is my favorite show on television.  If you are a fan of the classic Sherlock Holmes series being able to see the stories set in modern day London will warm your heart and grip your mind.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  The character developement and descriptive landscape was very imaginative.  It is written very similarly to \\"The Hunger Games\\".  Well worth the time.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Piano master is so great.It helps me consertrate on playing the piano and it helps me to get better and better.This helps me with my piano classes.
0596007124|5.0|I am an experienced programmer at Constant Contact Inc.  We mostly prefer this book over the GOF book because of the simple and interesting way this book deliver knowledge about design pattern.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This has the feel of the actual game....complete with the urge to slake it to make coins. drop!!! we like it!!
B004EPYZXK|3.0|i love movies that push the envelope...don't worry lemmings who loathed this tiny gem, your next Bay film or Cohen majesty will be out soon... Personally, to set up this take on A18, I thought Blair Witch was one of the scariest films I had ever seen. While Apollo18 isn't a horror, its certainly worth a whirl...<br /><br />Apollo 18 is what it is, and it also answers a very plausible question, and considering the United States thinking they are governors of the world, the chances of them leaving behind 2 men behind for a greater purpose, is forever plausible. Anything for the mighty USA to advance in all areas. Bruuu Hahhhh<br /><br />This movie is raw in all areas, most wont be able to handle the no crash and burn, explosions (boom, bam..yeah bammmm oh dead, BOOOm WOW) or lack of CGI and nearly all black and white, might be hard for most dolts, they will probably complain about the Cloverfield type camera jittering (no, its not bad at all) When you watch it you pretty much know what was going to happen and its predictable, yadda yadda yadda...watch it, enjoy it as something unique, with stellar sound and eerie lighting which adds a distinct flavor to the quirky premise....Moon it's not, but its certainly fun.
B0086700CM|4.0|so tracking addicted just when I die it is because it didn't read my swipe right doesn't always happen but when it does I get a little bummed
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app was highly rated, so I decided to give it a try.  Best decision ever.  Everything in the description is true!  A must have app!  Well worth the 5 dollar pricetag.l!
B0073U2FB2|4.0|I like this movie.  It kept me guessing and involved with the characters as they run from these invisible aliens.  Make sure you have a bowl of popcorn for a great night of fun.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This book is one of which a person can truly be inspired. The author grabs the attention of the reader at the very start and keeps the interest all through to the end. I like a story that is believable yet not predictable like this one.
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|This was an interesting movie.  Being set up then finding out it was the people you worked for isn't new, but how she handled it was.  Lots of excitment and chase scene with the usual narrow escape.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Would be really good for kids needing to practice simple addition.  Good, fun game for when you need something to do for a few minutes.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This was a great movie to experience.  Kids with superpowers and how they deal with that as well as normal life - great premise.  Especially when thing go bad. The question I had to ask myself was - which power they had was the best?  FLYING, OF COURSE!  The
0385344333|3.0|Jack Reacher, a rather menacing six foot five with a broken, bloody nose and dirty clothes, should have wondered why a car with two men and a woman would pick him up on the side of a freeway in rural Nebraska. But he did notice that they seemed to be not what they claimed to be. He could not have known that a brutal, though professional, execution of a man had occurred just hours earlier in a small town near the freeway.<br /><br />This novel starts well with Reacher, the local sheriff, and FBI agent Julia Sorenson, called in because the crime scene is an old pumping station with terrorism implications, trying to unravel the intricacies and contradictions of their situations. Unfortunately, the novel leaps its rails, playing the terrorism card to excess. One is confronted with a jumble of various gov agencies, multiple undercover agents, terroristic detention centers in the middle of nowhere, abandoned DOD bunkers housing scores of Arabic terrorists, etc, etc.<br /><br />The novel is saved by the appealing Jack Reacher and a couple of interesting story lines. And it is fairly gripping despite it excesses.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|This video was pretty good.  The plot was good and engaging.  I knew how it was going to end up, so no surprises there.  The chemistry between the two was believable and the preformances were great.  Didn't care for the ending.  Felt they could have come up with something better than that.
B008ZTVQLA|5.0|Ian Hunter is a musical treasure. He never ceases to amaze with the relevancy of his music. The man brings it in every way. From The At Last Its The 1958 Rock And Rolls Show right up to this new album, classic stuff. The new album? It's brilliant. Buy it. Treasure it. And be very glad you lived when an artist like Ian Hunter was around. I'm a fan.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game to play. lots of fun. reminds me of the old arcade game. very easy to play and its free!
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|This app keeps your brain moving fast and this is a better tetris.its awesum. Get this app. May help kids learn math the fast and fun way.
B008BIN9EW|2.0|This game SUX! I tried for 45 minutes to get my guy's to move where I wanted them to. There is NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to play this game! I have never played any RPGs before so maybe this game isn't for beginners but to have no guide at all? Lame
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this app reminds me of a game at a flying j near my town. I love that game and this one too.:)
B0091REZMW|5.0|love hidden object games. like that there are different rooms to explore. I do wish these games would have lesser requirements so that u don't have to use social media to progress or use real money. I do appreciate the talent involved in developement and thankful that it is available for.free.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|A good book for anyone who has never set up for basic formatting, but a lot still has to be figured out by trial and error.
B003SHYVO8|5.0|Really enjoyed Step it up 2 awesome dancing good music over all a great movie and with a small part with Channing Tatum still made my heart skip a beat
1591840562|5.0|It's basic. Words to the point. No bullshit. Overall a solid and somehow fantastic book to fire up your thinking process of building a new venture.<br />To those who has experience, it doesn't cover things in detail. So if you want to know any particular topic about start-up, try other books.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Worked great for about 3 months..... BUT now it doesnt let me watch anything or download anything this app STINKS!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book took a while to get into. I had no problem putting it down in the beginning. The reviews were so good I had to keep going, waiting. It finally got interesting. Not quiet finished but I can't wait to pick it back up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This tool is very easy to use. I love the size of the keys which allows fewer keystroke errors. Good calculator.

B008476HBM|5.0|I have always loved Pride and Prejudice. It is a stroy I read over and over every few years. There are so many similarities to life everywhere and how pride and prejudice could get in the way of happiness if we let it. I love that I can now read it on my kindle as well!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I liked this book a lot and feel that I must now pass it on to my husband in hopes that he will \\"get\\" my language!!!
B008D28HYS|4.0|Gradually gets more challenging. Not much for replay ability. Game play has been great on my phone but the app FCs from a certain point on my transformer.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|very helpful for insomnia. makes me sleep like a baby. zzz. zzzz.  love the ocean sounds too...too relaxed to even type this review..
0743496736|5.0|The terms \\"agonizing\\" and \\"one of the best books I've read\\" don't normally go together. But in this case they do. This is the first Jodi Picoult book that I've read all the way through. She had me in her clutches from the very first paragraph and didn't let go until the last page. She takes on a sensitive topic and offers it up from an unexpected perspective...getting the reader to sympathize with the killer. That takes guts and talent.<br /><br />Her portrayal of Peter is one of the best examples of character development I've read. I've been known to cry at movies but can not remember crying in a book...I had to stop for several minutes near the end because of the agony I felt for Peter, and his parents. Picoult's presentation of this topic, which we hear all too often in the news and yet not nearly enough attempts at a solution, offers room for discussion of all those eternal \\"ifs\\" that could have made things turn out so differently for Peter and the victims and the parents...not just in this novel but in real life.<br /><br />I tend to stay away from \\"dark\\" novels, but this one goes on my best books list.
B006LSZECO|3.0|...and then went downhill. I loved the first section; it gathered me in and I stayed up much later than usual reading it. When the second section began, I thought, well, ok, here's a twist, interesting...but I found myself not liking the characters and not as interested as I was. When the ending came, I felt I'd been cheated, and, like many of the other reviewers, I really disliked the characters I started out liking so well.<br />  So is this masterful writing, or, as many reviewers have said, a reflection of the author's inability to craft a good ending to the book? I haven't decided. After a day or so to reflect, I'm glad I read the book and did find it entertaining...but the ending was very anti-climatic and spoiled my memories of loving the book in the beginning.<br />  It's been a long time since I've been so ambivalent about a book. Upon reflection, maybe that's what the author was aiming for, because I'm certainly spending more time reflecting on it than I would any other book I rated 3 stars. My recommendation is to give it a read and see for yourself. I'm sure you have (as I have) wasted more time on worse reads!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|We have enjoyed this game, my 8 year old and me.  We have learned as we go, some of the finer points.  It would be nice to see a game that didn't have the option to spend real money to better their game - kind of a rat trap.  Other than that, it's a mindless, but fun waste of time.

B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I have to say I love Halestorm. Lzzy Hale is a phenomenal lead singer who can sing anything from hard rockin' jams to emotional ballads. One of the most underrated and underappreciated bands today. Favorite song, Here's To Us.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|loved this game couldnt put it xown once i got it it is even entertaining just to watch someone play
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|A little short on &quot;directions,&quot; but still absorbing and actually more fun than the real arcade game! Can't beat a bit of fun distraction that's even free!
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Lee Child has reverted to the formula that got him started. Good descriptions interposed with action. Unfortunately he cannot carry a story for 400+ pages and gets bogged down. Some of the descriptive passages need to be edited out. Or stop being lazy and put in another scene. A good read but could have been do much better
B0087HT36U|3.0|I got stuck on a couple of the \\"treasure\\" levels and went online to discover how to beat the level.  Turns out that I was doing the same things as the videos online, but, the levels were slightly different than the videos and the behaviour of the bombs/timing of the flames were longer making the completion of the levels impossible.  I find things like rolling carriers move much faster than the response from the system when I shoot making it impossible to rescue the peasants on some levels.

0545265355|5.0|These are very good, brand new books. The shipping was on time and the product was well protected when shipped. I enjoyed the books and its great that they come in a box that they can be organized and kept protected from any damage. Its worth buying it in the set then individually from a store.
0812992784|5.0|Brilliant insights, elegant, natural prose, timely and relevant.<br />This is a book for the ages.<br />Praise the author, who, it's, now clear, is the greatest writer of our age.<br />Nobel Prize for Literature.<br />Yes, by all that's intellectually honest and appropriately courageous.<br />Can I rate it six stars, or am I limited to five?
B008XG1X18|5.0|Like viewing different ideas and views on everyday household items. Good app to pass the time away. Have fun pinning.
0142419400|5.0|Falling in love has never been sweeter in this cute story by Stephanie Perkins.  And falling in love in Paris is even better.  Perkin's characters are realistic and flawed, but you can't help but loving them anyway.<br /><br />I have to say that this is the best falling-in-love-for-the-first-time story I have ever read.  I definitely had troubles putting it down.<br /><br />The ending went a little long and cheesy, but overall a great and sweet read.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to experience first love through someone else's eyes.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|This game is so much fun, I am totally addicted to it. Very challenging. I love the graphics. Works great on kindle fire.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this in one day. I loved how various twists were revealed at the right moments. Card has a way of hooking me into caring about Ender from just the first few pages and to the very end. I also liked how the language was kept mostly simple and the story was not bogged down in a bunch of techno babble.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun fun!! its just like the real thing and its not too bad waiting for coins because a lot of times they get dumped on you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was well written and very entertaining.  Each chapter had a new twist that made you unable to put the book down.  The end is great!
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Interesting but disappointing at the same time. Too many negative revalations about the restaurant business and those employed in the business of feeding us!I think that I enjoy the author's TV show more then his writing.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|For those of you that don't know, this movie is on PSN and i got to watch it early :D. Anyways, this movie is everything degeneration wasn't. The characters look better this time around and the story is super interesting! I don't want to spoil much but, let's just say that the last 40 min of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat as Leon has the fight of his life with some scary dudes. Lickers are in this movie and they are brutal! This movie has lot's of gore, action, and a bad@zz Leon. Ada also shines in this movie, so the spot light isn't always on Leon. Voice acting is awesome, action is amazing, sound, explosions, some humor, tear jerking moments, overall A MUST SEE!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game, just don't get caught up in &quot;buying&quot; coins with your real money. you want to keep playing and don't want it to end
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is great. Sometimes I love it and sometimes I can not figure out the solution and then I hate it.<br />Get it.
B007HJ98XC|5.0|Some good guys, some bad guys and some that don't know themselves which side they're on.  I'm hooked! A wild ride!
B005TOW9JM|4.0|Audio, Video, Disco is a different beast from what Cross was, but the two species are still closely related.  The newer album still carries Justice' signature sound, but it takes the music slightly different places.  Musically a bit more sound and refined than Cross, Audio, Video, Disco is also more relaxed.  It's eminently listenable, but doesn't give you the same involuntary urge to shake something, and I miss that a little bit.  At the same time, I find myself whistling bits of the title track, or singing a bit of a verse from On'N'On in the shower.  It gets to you, and sticks with you, but not in the same visceral way that Cross did.  That's not to say it's free of tracks with some drive behind them, but they don't dominate on an album more filled with more nuanced musical play.  Worth a listen; I would definitely buy it again.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|My family loves this song and we turn it up and dance around the house. Great song. Fun song for everyone
B0070NSPCU|5.0|There isn't much I can say that has not been said already.  This book is amazing.  I wasn't expecting much since I have not heard much about they author.  Also, whenever someone describe something as \\"epic\\", I am always a bit weary.  This book delivers.  The price is unbelievable.  Thank you Mr. Ryan for making this so affordable.  I very much enjoy the way the book is told.  One of the reason the book is so long is the details of Vaelin's early years.  It is a very important part of the story and I'm glad it wasn't glossed over.  There are so many great characters.  He keeps you guessing on Princess Lyrna's true intention.  Mr. Ryan left the ending at a good place.  I look forward to the next book.  If you like this book, you will like like Brandon Sanderson's \\"The Way of Kings\\".
B001NLKT60|3.0|Warning - trilogy is quite violent and graphic; may be a bit much for sensitive readers.<br />Good book if you're used to the dark undertones and sometimes awkward translation (from Swedish). Recommend all of the trilogy (Dragon Tattoo, Played With Fire, Kicked the Hornets' Nest) but recommend not reading out of order/sequence.<br />Couldn't find the book while traveling so purchased relatively pricey E-version.  Pro: Downloaded promptly and was everything vendor stated.<br />Con: Cost as much if not more than the book but isn't as transferable.  I only read fiction once so can't recoup or resell.<br />Wouldn't you know I ran across the softback version in a thrift store a few days after finishing on Kindle.  As the saying goes: \\"Want it bad-Get it bad\\"
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I read this book based on the number of 5-star reviews.  I wasn't disappointed. It is a story within a story.  The book started out with the retelling of Kvothe's story.  I really enjoy reading about Kvothe's early years and his struggle at the University.  I wanted to know more about his friend Auri.  The story pause every now and then and returns to the scene at the Waystone Inn.  It is a long book but I enjoyed reading it so much that it didn't seem like it.
B000VRNCGQ|5.0|I gave away my old vinyl albums years ago and I'm trying to recreate them again via mp3s. Great price for a classic album!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I have to admit it has been several months since I read the book.  It is hard to type up a book review on my kindle so I tend to put it off.  So I can only go by my the impression is left after so long.  I was pretty disappointed with this book after blazing through the first one.  I had to force myself to finish to find out what happened.  I could probably have skipped the whole thing with Felurian.  What?  Being the best wizard isn't enough?  Now he has to be the best lover too <eye roll>.  You would think someone as brilliant as Kvothe would wonder if there is a connection between Ash and Cinder.  At $9.99 for the Kindle version, I was expecting more.  For $2.99, I highly recommend \\"Raven's Shadow\\" by Anthony Ryan.  The way the story is told reminded me of \\"Scriber\\" by Ben S. Dobson.  It is a standalone novel.  The verdict is still out on whether I will buy the final book.  I hate to pay $9.99 and be disappointed.  I'll wait for the reviews.
B008XG1X18|4.0|when it opens correctly and doesn't get hung up, this app is great. it's very easy to view and pin things.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm a supporter of our American military, and a fan of spy and war novels.<br /><br />I bought this book thinking that regardless of how well this book is written, I wanted to support the effort.<br /><br />I read it in days.  I really enjoyed it.  Its well written, but conversational.  I suspect that is the impact of Kevin Maurer, an experienced author and journalist.<br /><br />This book feels like a conversation at a bar, or around a campfire.  I suspect it was written based on a series of interviews between the Seal and Mr. Maurer.<br /><br />The first half of the book covers a quick blast through \\"Mark Owen's\\" career as a Seal.  It covered both training and real missions.  There aren't a lot of details in the missions, but it does give a good overview of what it feels like to be a Seal.  The second half of the book covers the Osama Bin Laden (or UBL as they called him) mission.  It covered the extreme level of detailed practice missions they went through, while Washington decided what to do.  It covered the mission itself.  \\"Mr. Owen\\" was the team leader in the helicopter that crashed on the compound wall, his first crash in ten years as a Seal.<br /><br />If you like the military, this is at least a must buy, if not a must read.
0938045768|5.0|Bottom-line Up Front - I would buy this book again, and I have recommended it to friends.  This will not be a \\"5-star\\" for everyone.  For me it was.<br /><br />Pros-<br />-Any fitness level, age, gender, those with past injuries, etc. can use this program (major plus for me due to past shoulder injuries)<br />-Bodyweight exercises require some problem-solving for your own home or workout area, but technically require little-to-no \\"gym\\" time/equip<br />-The level of fitness obtained upon completion of this program will be of unique value to the martial artist, youth athletes, field and track athletes, future gymnasts<br />-Followed carefully a supperior level of safety compare to other methods of strength training<br />-The \\"convict\\" theme was a decent marketing \\"hook,\\" more importantly functions well as a writing \\"device\\" to communicate the author's point that patience, the appropriate progression and selection of calisthenics, and focus can help anyone who follows this program develop a level of physical capability often not seen even in professional athletes.<br />-A truly unique offering breaking away from typical overload, pyramids, 3-set, super-set, or other techniques for getting stronger<br /><br />Cons-<br />-NOT a book for anyone wanting to \\"Get Big,\\" NOT ABOUT BODYBUILDING!<br />-The program requires an extreme of patience largely extinct in modern society<br />-Perhaps based on the con above, the author rants excessively against his perception of weightlifting and bodybuilding, and perhaps somewhat belabors \\"old-time\\" examples of pre-weightlifting strongmen<br />-The \\"convict\\" theme at times appears forced to the point of being contrived
B0058PJ6NE|3.0|OK so at first this app was AMAZING I swear but... now everytime I try to use this app its says error check wick and yet I can buy other apps and I have an obvious connection Its a true shame this apps useless now and all I'm left with to remember it by is my measly 20 songs that I got out if it. so take my advice don't come to rely in this app because it will fail you in the end
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is not quit what I expected.  Most of the book deal with procedures in reaching the point where he was at the right place at the right time.  The final few chapters actually described what was involved in taking Osama out.  Was not as specific as some war time histories, but what was done is still mostly secret.  A description from his point of view was great.
B008XG1X18|4.0|this works well on my fire...occasionally it locks it up when starting and I have to shut it down and restart- so for that 4 stars instead of 5
B005OP7162|5.0|A fantastic show that I could not stop watching!  The story lines are all intertwined magnificently and I can hardly wait to watch the second season!
B006ZAZ31U|2.0|Easy read but fails to give significant insight into the life of Navy Seals or their families. Pretty much a whitewash with religious overtones of a profoundly disturbed individual. Our protagonist is a pleasant psychopath who covers his drug addiction and thrill seeking behaviors with a thin veneer of family, country and religion.
B001LJZ3AG|5.0|Saw them at RFK way back in the day.  Lost the video years ago.  This album on mp3 is the next best thing.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is not my usual genre, but looked interesting. I could not put it down. My wife (who is Irish) and I went to Ireland last year. That gave me some great visuals of what what going on. Definitely recommended!
B005K17RU0|2.0|Eats battery it starts on its own.<br />Each time i check it has restarted I only want it runnign when I choose not all the time.<br />also asks for access to to many features.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so cool I can play and play all day long and never get enough of it. So you gotta get this game.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Fascinating story, great acting and scripting.  Classic HBO.  Presentation box is spectacular - like a well bound old book.  Pity it only went for two series.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have enjoyed reading the book \\"Wheat Belly\\". My husband and I have been following his recommendations to eliminate wheat from our diet and we feel very good about the results. We recommend the book to many family and friends when discussing diet choices.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love puzzel games and fun games with this game I feel this game is perfect. But sometimes u get frustrated that u lose the good coins u can wait.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what I wanted in a calculator.  Extremely easy to use. I add my shopping items as I go through the store and find it easy to get the tax figured and added easily to a memory total.  The display is large enough for someone over forty to see without having to need reading glasses on.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I used to love this game, but now, I think that with the new update, it moves WAY too fast even at the beginning it moves really fast. I think that maybe its just a glitch bit it would be great if Halfbrick could fix or change this
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Man, just when you think you're good at math, this game makes you think again!!  This game is easy to play, great fun, with no annoying ads popping up!  I would suggest it!!!
B0064W639K|5.0|The story telling is very gripping while the artwork is simply stunning. One is always at tenterhooks to know the killer. The climax and twist at the end make it a must read for Batman and comics fans.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|I love Paul McCartney's [[ASIN:B0076OW9DE Kisses On The Bottom]] (see my review), and I just saw the \\"Live Kisses\\" special on PBS, which was fantastic, so I will be pre-ordering this DVD, which has even more material and interviews than the PBS version did.  Paul may be 70 years old, but he still sings better than many performers half his age (take that, \\"American Idol\\" wannabes)! I will add more details to this review when I receive it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I watched the DVD last night (November 16).  It runs about 15 minutes longer than the PBS special, and has most of the songs from KISSES ON THE BOTTOM, along with interview segments with Paul, Diana Krall, and the rest of the crew.  The 5.1 surround sound is excellent.  Bonus features include six versions of the \\"My Valentine\\" video, with Natalie Portman and Johnny Depp (not sure why they were chosen), a mini-documentary on the making of the video, two versions of the KISSES ON THE BOTTOM photo shoot, one set to \\"My Valentine,\\" the other featuring commentary by Paul with excerpts from the songs on the album.  Finally, there is an interesting interview with Macca and producer Tommy LiPuma on the making of the album.  It is packaged in a nice hardcover book with photos and liner notes by Elvis Costello (the husband of the gorgeous pianist).<br /><br />Can you imagine Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, or Katy Perry making an album like this? Nah...neither can I.<br /><br />This DVD is a must-have for Macca fans, Great American Songbook fans, and anyone who likes good relaxing music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and this app works great on my Kindle Fire.  Would recommend this for anyone who loves this site.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I got the game for my wife she loves them in the arcades...but found myself playing it too. Dealt good game.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|I can best describe UniWar HD as a turn-based, StarCraft-like game.  There is a broad variety of units and terrains.  The terrains provide bonuses or penalties to certain units.  Different unit types have different strengths and weakness, and some are better against certain enemy unit types than others.  There is a bit of a story, but that's probably the weakest part of the game.  I really like the game because -- being turn-based -- it focuses on strategic thinking rather than how fast you can click a mouse or tap on a screen.
0062060562|3.0|This was a well done book, but would have been MUCH better as a shorter novel. A couple of hundred pages could have been cut, with the same result. THE reader gets it....GROUNDHOG DAY EVERY MORNING. A tiny touch of suspense didn't begin to start until after about 100 pages. SLOW SLOG. However, it was interesting to see what an amnesiac really goes through. Can't remember old memories, cannot form new ones. By the by, I was surprised to see that this author was a man.
B00881VLCE|5.0|it is a good game it gives you choices to pick what section you want like love it will give you love pictures and it is good for kids.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I kinda liked the movie but love the books I read them all really fast and will read them again.
0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed the book! I really liked the story line plus the erotic parts in it. First time reading a erotic/romance book. Bought part 2 which I thought was really good too. Reading part 3 now.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Just a little romantic movie get's you alot in return!!! Thank you Jane Austin for this wonderful book that made a wonderful movie.
0345803493|5.0|Better than part 1, and I really liked part 1. I've never read exotic/romance books before. 50 shades of grey were my firsts. Bought part 3 also.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This book brought in ideas that I think most are aware of but maybe lose in the struggle.  It is much easier to focus on what is wrong,; you can deflect issues of accountability through negative assessment.  This book flushes that out and outlines ways of creating success in change.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|The premise of the story is about a Secret Service agent entrapped in a small city, Wayward Pines. He wakes up in Wayward Pines so badly beaten that he can hardly move and cannot remember who he is. He has no wallet, no cell phone, no money. He seeks help, eventually, from the townspeople and no one, not even the sheriff, is interested in listening to his story or helping him in his predicament. Eventually, he does get assistance from one person only to find he is trapped in the town and cannot get out. He infuriates the people of Wayward Pines by trying to leave. He gets injured, he gets beaten so badly, so often that it makes a good sifi book into a totally unbelievable script.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app has worked great for the kindle fire, but lately it hasn't been working.  The app says that they have something to fix it, but they haven't put anything up on amazon though. I hope they fix it soon because the app is great!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent book.  Read it immediately !  Happy Birthday Mr King !!!  Live long and prosper.  I love all of your books.  You and Mr Gaiman are the best writers of the world.
0545265355|5.0|I really love the quality of the books that I got in this set.  Although they fit a little snugly in the box, the books themselves were in perfect shape.  I really like the series, and always had to borrow my friends' books, so I finally got a set of my own.  It was a good choice!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I probably would have loved this book in my twenties but at fifty years of age it's a lot of \\"been there, read that\\". It's just a current and um, shall I say, more \\"detailed\\" version of the Barbara Cartland period paperbacks my grandmother read.  That being said, I did come away a bit more knowledgeable about sexual fetish, just not really sure if I wanted this knowledge... Hey, it's a fun beach read if you're in the mood, and if not, it just may get you there.  ;)
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Very addicting game. Blocks could stand to be smaller &amp; doesn't always turn the blocks like it should. Great time killer.
B00009NH5W|5.0|This is the first CD I can recall where his eyes are open!  Love this guy, CD came in great shape and on time.  So happy to have it and thank you for your services.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Pretty handy to have on your phone or tablet. Does exactly what it says, plain and simple as that. Would recommend getting it for sure.
0812993292|5.0|A librarian friend recommended this book because I had recently been to many of the places Harold goes. I ended up loving the book, although I went through periods of frustration with both Harold and his wife. By the end, though, I realized there were many threads and issues here that begged discussion with another reader. We had recently seen the movie Hope Springs, so it found it interesting that here was another older couple in a rut. Do not expect action and adventure. This is a study of two people and a marriage and how tragedy, jealousy, and courage affect them. It's a keeper to be read again.
B0050IY61G|5.0|This book is easy to read and full of practical information. I highly recommend it to the lay person or professional.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was nothing short of pornography.  It is way over the top in outrageous scenarios that demean and belittle women.  This is the kind of GARBAGE that is shaping the next generation in this country. After YEARS of women fighting for respect and dignity, this book gives the impression that a woman should be HAPPY to be a man's slave. What a horrible message to send to our daughters AND sons.  Aren't there enough men in this world who are abusive and demeaning to women without giving them another HOW TO book. A friend said she had heard this was a best sellar. Intrigued, I purchased it online.  I returned this book for a full refund after the first 100 pages.  There is SO MUCH GOOD READING out the why would anyone CHOOSE to fill their minds with this SMUTT.
1606863622|5.0|I fell love with this book, and this book is far most favorite book out of all others. Sparks yet another person who inspire me to write my book, [[ASIN:B009AIXFPU Moonlight Witches (Book 1)]]<br /><br />I really love his books and his passion. This book crept inside of me and made me cried especially John and his father. Two thumbs up and dropped mouth!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|totally kool........ it's ah nice time killer and I always loved this game but wasway to cheap ta waste the money in the arcade.... total win win lol
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I don't quite understand the rave reviews I read. The beginning of the book was intriguing enough to keep me enthralled, but then it lost me. I just hated the sci fi stuff thrown in and it lost its creepiness immediately. It definitely does have a Stephen King tone to it, and echoes his type of writing, but I am still disappointed.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Awesome Game! Simple enough for the younger kids to play and still entertaining for the older ones! It's worth the buy!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|wonderful book, make you laught,cry and fall in love<br /><br />I just finished reading this book , and i have to write a review,i cried ,laught and devour this book like no one before. If you are a romantic or not ... like me ,you will love it too
B00846REIS|4.0|Giedeon runs a close second to Christian Gray. He is hot, has tons of money, can be carrying and has his own issues. Must Read!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|A good read but rough. Since I'd enjoyed the author's latest \\"Gone Girl,\\" I wanted to try her first. Am now reading her 2nd, Dark Places. Of the 3, I would rate GG the best, Sharp Objects #2, and Dark Places #3.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|I use this little meditation moment whenever I start heading over the top of stress which is often these days as I care for a father with dementia...it also helps me fall asleep. Try it a few times...totally worth it...
B0087HT36U|3.0|its a pretty good app. but it really rodent entertain me as much as the other apps I have. I wish the developers would find a way to make this more interesting.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I really liked this album from the start. A few songs have been played a lot on the radio and have worn on me a bit, but overall it's a great piece of art!
B00729V7NG|5.0|Max are one of my favorite metal singers of all time, Im happy he brings us this outstanding metal to us but he really should patch things up with Kisser and co in Sepultura and bring us the reunion tour we all want! But if that doesn't happen this is a very good substitute. Horns UP!!
B00884GR0W|2.0|I really don't like it I paid and it was the exact same thing as the free version and now I cant get my money back its a bad ripp off of minecraft
0786955570|5.0|I posted this to a board game forums, Think of it as suggestions to improve play.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I'm loving Castle Ravenloft. I only had to make a few changes. Instead of always drawing a card when you don't explore, I roll a d20, 1-15 draw, 16-20 don't draw. This really stopped if from feeling like you had no hope, without making it to easy. Also, I don't discard and redraw when a encounter isn't relevant, you don't redraw treasures when not relevant, I don't think you should have to redraw encounters. When I lvl to lvl 2, I heal for healing surge.<br /><br />I'm thinking of also letting you remove environmental cards from play by spending exp, I'm thinking 7-10. People should give the game a try with these slight mods, I find they still keep the balance of play, while adding 100% to the enjoyment.<br /><br />I have many other ideas to improve play, I'll look into play testing and writing them up. I know some people feel like the rules of a game are written in stone, I say rules are made to be broken. You paid good money for this game, why not adapt it to your needs. Still, even if it weren't a playable game, it's well worth the 39.71 I got it for off Amazon just for the components.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Great game, don't let the haters run you away from a game that with a few tweaks, can be a extremely enjoyable experience. Oh, don't expect this to be DnD to the letter, this is Castle Ravenloft the board game, not DnD 4th edition.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I loved playing this game. It was interesting and addictive. I was very sad when I finished and had no more bubbles to play with
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in the book. Felt like it was too drawn out without a lot of \\"meat\\" but then I have read other books about Seals so perhaps feeling I already knew what a Seal endures didn't find it all that interesting.  Liked the part about the actual capture.  Can't understand how anyone can say secrets were revealed!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is real!  you cannot go wrong buying and reading this book. I am a Viet-Nam vet and can tell you I recognise fact from fiction. Riveting! If you can't read it straight thru, you can't wait to get back to it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I think Dexter has regained it's momentum in this great season. I am just writing this review to warn buyers of the spoiler in the previews section, which is difficult to skip, and gives away the ending of the season. If you are unable to skip the previews, keep the volume off and try not to look until the menu comes up. I was a little angry, but otherwise a fantastic season.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|The very last page references The seven Daughters of Eve, which themes through the book.  There is much science-based fiction, which any chemist or biologist would love.  I also love the historical references.  Whenever I visit foreign countries, a book like this helps me to \\"frame\\" the historical background as I look around.  The sequel really nails it!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I'm hooked on this series, and love all the characters, even the ones I hate, but to me the dialogue sounds as if all the writers were born well after the sixties. So many idioms that resonate of the nineties and oughts creep in, such as \\"I don't like your tone\\", or \\"can I get a glass of water\\" Don't even get me started about all the characters whining about their feelings, as if it were the '80s. From the beginning, many characters seem to have a 21st century ironic self awareness of their prejudices, which would have mostly gone unspoken at that time. Oh well, I still love the show.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|Great young actors of the 80s great performances a peek Into the styles of the early 80s. The cars are interesting to look at now in 2012
B00846REIS|4.0|I have done the 50 shades and though they have more of a love story going I enjoyed Bared to much more.  I was expecting something more a long the lines of Shades and was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't.  I would highly recommend this book.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Echoing other reviews this is a weak book.  Wait for the paperback, if at all.  I love the Jack Reacher series and pre ordered this book.  The plot was so weak it felt like a small plot in some larger book that he expanded to try and fill the pages to make this a book.
B0090EIILU|5.0|This man is so freaky funny.  I loved borat, enjoyed Bruno and can't stop laughing about the dictator.  Even the trailers that I knew were coming still made me LoL!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was made for kids but I enjoyed it as much as my son.  I LOVE the minion's.  The music is great also.  I rented it for my son to watch on the plane and it kept his attention the whole flight.  Thumbs up for this pic.
B002QNEJT2|5.0|Next to Mash this is the best TV series, ever.  The story line is the most innovative of any on TV.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|sweet like god of war. of course you can buy credits or slowly earn them. good game<br />can play for hours
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like playing it every day and all day long.But then it gets boring after a while it's till fun.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm only just getting into book 4, so this review is based on the first 3. The third book is absolutely excellent. I could not put it down for most of it, especially from around half way to the end. The developments of Jon Snow, the entire remaining Stark family, the battle for Crown, Brienne, the story of the wedding at Twin towers, all of it is captivating and I didn't even mention the dragons and Dany. As GRRM says in the beginning of book 4, he's built a solid foundation from which to build on this story. That's very true...if you've liked books 1 and 2, you will find that 3 is better yet, just have patience, it's long.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|I have been holding out on watching this movie for a while now. But I finally watched it. And I have to say it's good but not great. In today's saturated animated movie market, no one will actually remember this movie. While it was fun, it's nothing special. The whole western theme was amazing though. And character animation and details were great. Johnny Depp was excellent as Rango.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This was one of the most startling movies I have seen in a long time.  Christian Bale got his weight down to 120 pounds just to play the part and gives a performance that is worthy of an Academy Award.
B000SEFNMS|1.0|The main reason I am willing to purchase Kindle books, rather than check them out from the library, is to listen to them.  This book has text-to-speech disabled.  Just wanted to warn others before they waste their money.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This book reminds me a lot of his The five people you meet in heaven novel. If you have read that novel and enjoyed it, you will definitely love this one. I haven't found a Mitch Albom book that I didn't like yet. He seems to know how to tug at your heart strings and yet make you feel good at the same time.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I really love this game it is the best game ever!!!!!!  :) I would love to have the game to keep forever!!!
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Total krak once you get it.  Some minor control issues, but a clever spin on the puzzler.  Look forward to more from these guys.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|The knife is large, well balanced and strong (thick at 1/4\\").  It's a heavy knife and it came very sharp.  The knife was great for baton wood splitting.  The only complaint I have is that the black coating that protects from rust comes off quite easily under heavy use such as baton splitting or opening a can.  The knife itself handles both tasks readily with minimal, if any, damage to the sharpness of the blade.<br /><br />I love the sheath.  I quickly replaced the built in belt loop with a tek-lok loop.  The tek-lok connects to sheath via three holes on the blade side of the sheath.  The other side's bulge makes it impossible to connect the clip at more than 3 tek-lok holes.  Despite being only connected on the blade side, it's quite secure.  It sits on a duty belt in a horizontal position and is easily removed and replaced.  When moving or running, the knife is fairly noiseless in the sheath.  The sheath is also a very hard plastic that is fairly tough.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Fantasy literature needs writers like Anthony Ryan. Although fantasy books are becoming more and more predictable and most writers repeat themselves (publishing books by the dozens), \\"Raven's Shadow Book One: Blood Song\\" is clearly a pleasent surprise. I liked the plot, the characters and could not put the book down. As a fellow reader commented, I felt sorry for paying such a low price for such a good book. On the negative side, there were several editing errors in the version that I read but I would not like to give 4 stars for this reason.
B002KH4DBI|4.0|About A Boy may not be for everyone, but it works for me. The acting, writing and directing make this one of my go-to favorites, up there with Jerry McGuire and As Good As It Gets. The romance is plausible, the situations are quite funny, and the dramatic payoff at the school talent show is always wonderful. Good fun.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|The Zoom lens is really working. We got 2 pieces me and my friend. Both of them are working fine and they are easy to install. maybe the Lens protector is hard to install! I didn't manage to install it but the Zoom piece is very easy to install.<br />The Zoom lens is working almost half distance but the 2 players is not working well needs adjustment.<br />Overall if you have space issue Get this one it is 100% good
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I really like this app, finally I can search for my favorite music and it is guaranteed that I will find the original music video, and not some kind of third handed re-mix like on YouTube. Great App. The only downside is that it only lets you use one folder for your favorite music while I would like to create several. Otherwise, great little tool to have.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|Ghost Rider:Spirit of Vengeance(released Feb/12) stars Nicholas Cage as the Ghost rider,Johnny Blaze,Johnny Whitworth as Ray Carrigan,Fergus Riordan as Danny,Ciar&aacute;n Hinds as Roarke,Violante Placido as Nadya,Danny's mother,and Idris Elba as Moreau.This installment of the movie franchise(yes,you bet there will be sequels),is a film onto itself,that is you don't need to have seen the first to get this one.Also it has a far greater sense of humour and a more balls-to-the-walls dynamic than the previous venture,and I liked it.<br />The plot finds the Rider in eastern Europe.A black Frenchman by the name of Moreau is after protecting a boy named Danny and his mother Nadya.They are on the run from one Ray Carrigan,who works for none other than the devil himself,this incarnation going by the name of Roarke.The pair don't stop to accept Moreau's help as they're too busy fleeing from Ray,and just by the skin of their teeth.<br />Moreau seeks out and finds the Ghost Rider and asks him to help him to find and protect Danny,and in exchange he will rid Johnny Blaze of his inner demon.The bargain made,they set out to find and confront Ray and his boys,and get Danny back.At one point a confrontation of gigantic proportions takes place in a quarry.Ray has rendezvoused with an arms dealer who allows him the use of a bunker busting bazooka.The Ghost Rider appears and Ray goes to work,but nothing stops the Rider who ends up tearing the entire contingent of men there apart,using an immense digger that comes to life in flames.Ray is seemingly dead and the Rider has both mother and Danny,safe for the moment.<br />They arrive at a monastery where the monks hide the boy and his mother for their own safety and the Rider undergoes a cleansing ritual of sorts within the monastery's catacombs.Before he does we learn that it was an ancient angel that was taken down to hell and turned mad,that now inhabits Blaze's body.When the Rider comes out,the demon within is gone,as Moreau promised,but the monks are now bent on killing the boy,as he is the child of Satan and must be taken care of before the devil comes to inhabit his body.Before the monks can perform their duty,Ray re-appears,now risen from the dead by the devil and given enhanced powers.He kills each monk but Johnny and company are powerless to stop Ray from taking the boy to Roarke.<br />The scene switches to Turkey at an ancient site of ruins,where the devil will transfer himself into Danny.Johnny and Moreau storm the ceremony and the shooting begins.Moreau is killed in the ensuing struggle by Ray and Johnny is captured and about to be killed by Ray also.However Danny stops Johnny's death by seconds,walks up to Johnny and taking Johnny's head in his hands gives him back his Ghost Rider powers once more.Roarke and Ray,however,get away with Danny.<br />A high speed pursuit takes place in which Ray is killed and the vehicle with the devil and Danny is sent out of control and ends up upside down at the side of the road.The Rider whips out his chain and sends the devil back home,and then revives an apparently deceased Danny with the good spirit of justice from the original angel inside of him.The Rider himself now appears in blue flames,riding into the distance.Fade to black.<br />I love the sense of humour in this film and the much more intense dynamic that Johnny/the Rider exhibits;harkening back to the comics.We see Johnny's control,what he ever had of it,is now not as strong as it used to be,as the spirit within has grown much stronger since we last saw him.We also learn about the ancient spirit that inhabits his body,that IT was driven mad,which explains Johnny's ever perverse and growing behavioral change.Also someone has FINALLY explained and shown,what happens to such a character as the Rider,when on fire and in his full glory,when he has to go to the washroom!! He explains it to Danny,and I won't give away the answer if you haven't seen it,but it is to die for,so to speak.There are some plot weaknesses in the film,such as Moreau's back story and Nadya's disappearance and sudden reappearance from Eastern Europe to Turkey.I am wondering whether an extended version might help explain these two points better.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes only.<br />All in all a step up,I think,from the original film as it pushes the whole kit and kaboodle up a notch,with some interesting developments in Blaze's character and alter ego.The story and its elements harken back a little more to its comic book origins,and along with the Rider's epic battles and off-kilter attitude it also has a nice sense of humour about itself.4-4 1/2 stars.On fire and recommended!!aknesses in the film,such as Moreau's back story and Nadya's disappearance and sudden reappearance from Eastern Europe to Turkey.I am wondering whether an extended version might help explain these two points better.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes only.<br />All in all a step up,I think,from the original film as it pushes the whole kit and kaboodle up a notch,with some interesting developments in Blaze's character and alter ego.The story and its elements harken back a little more to its comic book origins,and along with the Rider's epic battles and off-kilter attitude it also has a nice sense of humour about itself.4-4 1/2 stars.On fire and recommended!!

B007EC27QM|5.0|no negitives works well. my go to calculator when I need big type. worth the price for sure. got to get it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept me mesmerized through the whole book.  I would recommend this to any woman.  I can't wait to buy the next one.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game that you can play for free. There is nothing in that game you can't unlock with time, which adds an element of achievement.
B00400NHRO|5.0|I read this years ago when I was in college.  I subsequently have just repeated reading it 25 years after I have graduated from medical school.  Although cynical it is entertaining and enlightening.
0789318245|5.0|I got this for my granddaughter who is getting back into tattoo work.<br />She was really thrilled.<br />I wanted her to have examples of work outside of what she had done in the past.<br />I was afraid she would be disappointed at the simplicity of some of the work, but she found that very valuable.<br />It gave her what I wanted to give her.<br />George H.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it! It was a great story, I enjoyed it. Kept me wanting to read more and more. I look forward to her next book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome book, hate it that he did release classified info, and his life as a free man is numbered, but I think its an great book to read!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addicting. love it.works great on the kindle fire. always want more coins to keep playing. enjoy the puzzles. takes me back to my childhood at the fair.
B008XG1X18|4.0|A little slow to load but otherwise great for the kindle. I do wish there was a way to flag where you last were beccause kindle doesn't keep the app open when you switch to something else
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an amazingly written book, with compelling character descriptions.  It was a page turner....complete with white knuckles....HOWEVER.....without ruining it for anyone who hasn't read it....the ending lowered it from 5 stars to 4 for me.<br />Disappointing and unsatisfying finish to an otherwise incredible book....but I'll have to say it DOES leave possibilities for a part II....
B009329ZF2|5.0|Just because its based on a board game that's been around for over forty years, doesn't mean this films that far fetched. I even watched it with my dad, who's a twenty eight year veteran that did most of his work in Hawaii, well he was impressed. The idea of mixing the past with the present is great. The film has wonderful music, great one liners and of corse, Liam Neison.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|A lot of action and depth with many twists and turns.  A very active cop for an \\"off duty\\" officer with suprising sentimental insight.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the omnibus edition...It was fantastic...Loved the concept, it kept my interest through the whole book.  Couldn't wait to see how it ended.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Pentagon's security naysayers castigating the author for not vetting the content of this book with them only peaked my interest in reading it before in got 'Operation Darkhearted' (the govenrment bought up all of the first edition of this book before the public got a shot at reading it). I found it no more revealing than any of the dozens of other SEAL insider books out there. In depicting the actual Geronimo operation, the lone and potentially fatal blunder of losing a super-secret ultra-quiet Blackhawk helo was given short shrift, but any military rotary wing pilot could easily figure out what went wrong, and also what went stunningly right with the pilot putting the bird down the way he did. All that being said, I found this book informative as to the depth of training these operators constantly go through the maintain the skills necessary to be the point of the spear we regularly require them to be. The extreme threats the insurgency warfare models pose as far as defensive unpredictability and small unit execution effectiveness means that fewer warriors must be faster, more versatile and way more lethal than we have been used to in military operations. This book subtly argues this point. It also effectively portrays the pressures of maintaining their edge the special operators face over the length and breadth of their unique careers. Good book, points well taken, and interesting insight behind the made-for-the-public version of this singly monumental event in the insurgency battle. Freedom of the press is, as I last recalled, still one of the great freedoms these guys fight to protect.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Awesome!! I'm so glad they got rid of certain people (don't want to say who in case people haven't seen it yet). Can't wait for season 3 to start!
1451627297|5.0|11/22/63 is easily King's best work of recent years.  The amount of research done, from the events of the Kennedy assassination to the price of a root beer float in 1958, is quite impressive.  The characters are well conceived, and while the idea of time travel and stopping the Kennedy assassination has been done, 11/22/63 is one of the most compelling and thoughtful of them.  Absolutely recommended.
B000VCDJQY|5.0|Epica's most epic, speedy and emotionally charged bombastic effort of all their releases to date; possibly ever. All the tracks in this collection are so emotional, whether it be the fast and epic or soulful ballads. There's lots of emotion thrown around; a spectrum ranging from sadness to anger; from desperation to hope. One major emotion fuels this heavy release. You'll have to buy it to find out :)<br /><br />The guiding concept of this collection: God created many different religions for humanity to figure out and overcome them; so as to discover that, in nature and essence, they're all in fact the same one.  The dispute between science and religion and other controversial topics are lyric'd; but at the same time, does not attack either side.  Your attention will yield to their controversial points. Intellectual Candy and Mind Seductive Entertainment. Set it in stone, it is a masterpiece.
0736092269|5.0|This is a great book if you are looking for something simple to understand and very useful and detailed at the same time which is really something hard to find, illustrations and short explanations of exercises give you a great perspective of what muscles are involved in what exercise. I recommend it to all of you out there who are starting our and those more experienced as well, sometimes we can be overwhelmed with information like myself, I've previously bought Arnold's encyclopedia among other books, looked at videos, etc and this book makes it so simple.<br />Next edition, if there'll be any, should include something about nutrition keeping it simple and easy to understand.<br />5 stars!
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Kimberly has a fantastic voice! The brothers, Neil & Reid, have crazy skills on the instruments! Great CD for county music fans!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|this game is horrible. The controls are bad and there is only one level. You can only pick pac-man ur driver and its really easy. Don't buy this game. Ur just wasting ur time. After one play u will be un-installing this game like me.
0439023513|5.0|I loved it! Definitely a must read for all tributes out there. An incredible conclusion to the series. I didn't want the book to end.
0307888908|5.0|I have found valuable information in this book about things one can do to move forward in any area of life, not just in business/ career. Coupled with network tips from the founder of LinkedIn ( author of this book) this should produce good results.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book even more than the first (which I thought was impossible)! I think it was genius of Collins to write an entire second book with a similar premise than the first, yet with much more depth since we already know the characters and our emotions are already invested in them. I loved loved loved this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought that the sequel to the first book would not compare. Boy was I wrong I am going to start the third one tonight.
B0085YNML2|5.0|It is awesome. We are addicted... the little chameleon is so cute. I love when he gulps the bug. YUM!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|If you're looking for a game that's just great fun without using a ton of skill,  then this is for you. I just started playing it and it's great. The graphics are amazing on my Kindle Fire! I would recommend this game for those people that are a fans of the dungeon crawlers of old, like Dungeons. and Dragons, the stand up arcade version.
0345803493|5.0|i really havent gotten to the \\"good parts\\" of this book. its very slow so far. i imagine its going to be a lot of reading but ill take the time and finish it
B005LAIHHC|4.0|It was very funny adult humor, but not so bad that it could not have been rated.<br />The only nudity was so brief (and not much to be seen, to tell the truth) it could have been R rated.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|I love this film. It starts out with how a rat lives, and there's a GREAT history of rats documentary on here. If you ever want a rodent pet, rats are phenomenal critters. Very affectionate, extremely smart, unbelievably clean-they actually put their food and waste in neat piles-and best of all VERY durable if you have kids. I saved mine from being a lab animal. They can jump 3 feet easily, and can fall 5 stories without injury. They can swim for three days as long as they can see. They smell as a dog does.<br /><br />Mine was the cleanest rodent I've ever had. Ferrets are stinky!<br /><br />So, I was willing to roll with the premise from go. This one is as gorgeous as cars, toy story, princess and the frog and up. I'd watch them just based on that. Oh, and Nemo. It's about a guy who a rat controls because the guy can't cook but the rat can, so he controls him with his hair.<br /><br />This is JUST a BEAUTIFUL movie, and you'd be missing a lot of you didn't have it in blu-ray.<br /><br />No, white rats don't bite. A cat, on the other hand....I never had my rat bite me.
B008XG1X18|3.0|and when it works it is fantastic! but it locks up or doesn't open once for every 5-6 times I use this app.
B0086700CM|5.0|funest game I ever played in all of my game I have already played you made a great game good luck with your next game
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|I love thrillers...or I should say I love well written thrillers. This is a book I thoroughly enjoyed. It was taut, and fun. I didn't feel like I had read it before even though it was about a troubled cop chasing a serial killer. The ending, for me, was intense! Loved it!! My only complaint is that I kinda knew who had done it early in the book and I hate that. But to make up for it, it was well written and researched. It was fun and I always love a serial killer with an awesome calling card and a Snowman was really cool.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|what a great game. the controls are very responsive and easy to use. it is a lot of fun to play
B008YRVW0I|5.0|it is very addicting, and it is as good playing on my fire as it is playing on my computer
B0058YPILY|3.0|The show gets weaker with each season, same-old.... same-old.....,<br />if not for the pretty good actual crime stories I would not watch it anymore<br />Especially the final two episodes had incredibly bad writing<br />so: only for die-hard C.M. fans......
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Just wanted to get to the end. Forgot how much I liked the way the King writes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so much fun I spent 30 minuets on it like every morning. I lost my kindle for a week and this is the game I missed most.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Got it as the free game of the day. You can buy buster bombs but you don't need them. I got some do I could get all the trophies. It is similar to angry birds but do much more fun.
B002OT730K|5.0|:-)  This is the bomb.  If you only have enough money for one rolling stones cd get this one.  You can't go wrong with this cd.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Entertaining but mostly formulaic in the plot development. Acting was above average, and watching the movie is not a complete waste of time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i love this app it makes it easier to know specifically how much battery i have and you have many settings for your satisfaction
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I have great respect for the Navy Seals. I am amazed at what they can do. Some of the reviewers evidently thought the author was egotistical, what did they expect? I thought his presentation was rather humble.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The title should have been \\"Courting Death\\" , the luck factor that enables success of a muission is so conspicuous and so mandatory, if I may say so , the Seals truly are pushing themselves to the very edge of survival.That said , the racy style of the author wherein he is able to conjure up sequences of images much like a thriller movie, as one reads the book, is laudatory to say the least and raises the bar manifold. the book ensnares you to an extent that one forgets everything else, till completely read.
159413586X|5.0|I thought this book had a perfect ending to the trilogy.  I absolutely loved everything about it.  The twists were wonderful and I couldn't put it down!  I read this book in 4 hours and recommend the trilogy of the hunger games to everyone I know.  I just wish there were more!
B007PVHANM|5.0|I am a huge Bob Marley fan.  My whole family went to see this movie at the theater when it came out. It was so well done that we had to own it when it came out on DVD. This is the most comprehensive and informative movie ever made about Bob Marley.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|this thing is 20mb that is lot if you like Maori mart you might like it other wise it SUCKS
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I started playing this game thinking that I would like it but this game is @$#%. You can only play one level on expert or easy and only with pac-man. This game sucks!!
B000YH6YG8|3.0|I heard some good things about this movie that built my expectations, that were left unmet. The story to me was largely unbelievable. The acting by many was weak including Edward Norton. There are much better movies about the dangers of racism and extremism.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I didn't really care for angry birds but I really like this one. I beat all the levels and didn't even need to use my super bomb. some were a bit tricky but I eventually figured it out. I need more levels. I would have given it 5 stars but I uninstalled it because on my second time playing it the touch was a bit off. now I can't get it back on my kindle fire.
1416550550|5.0|The author tells the story in a very well written story line.  As a reader I was caught with the past and current mixture. The ending was a surprise. Great book to read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love the memory features with a runnning tally and last amount entered display. Ideal for balancing a check book with a lot of entries.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I just love youtube and it is a downloader that is what I'm talking bout Omb than ain't did that lol lol lol
1593078684|5.0|Absolutely beautiful book.  I would've expected nothing less from my favorite artist, Yoshitaka Amano.  Each page is its own story.  It's not possible to just flip through this book.  To enjoy his art completely, is to study each piece.  There is art inside of art.  The details are amazing and brilliant.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Great performances, great colors, and a good story all make for a very enjoyable and fun movie. What fine actors. I love them. Highly recommended. Short and very sweet review.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a real page turner. This book had some twists and turns that I didn't see coming. I really couldn't put it down. Good fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me on edge the whole time and the characters were so well thought out! also love the slight love story throughout the book.. cant wait to read the second one!!!!
B00005JLKN|5.0|The first in a series of movies about Hannibal Lector and the start of a great series. Anthony Hopkins is at his best as Hannibal Lector. I saw Silence of the Lambs several years back with my husband and after that we got into the series and watched them all. Now I own the complete set. I've watched them over and over again.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great controls and fun. the best part is you can keep going with out having to shell out any money.. your able to upgrade with points you've earned.
B003RUZKC8|2.0|The movie is okay, but it left a lot to be desired. It had potential, but didn't quite reach it. Save this one for when you're truly bored and anything will do.
B0085157B8|5.0|This movie was extemely good. It was just as good as the first movie, It was just a really quick movie it seemed.
B002JODPSO|4.0|I continue to enjoy John McCain (sp?). Just plain fun to watch these shows. I enjoyed the storyline, action, and acting. This movie completed a great movie night. My daughter and I both loved it.
0525953728|1.0|Extremely disappointing. This book is an insult - I learned nothing, i wasn't inspired, i wasn't even entertained. I've never written any review, but when you come across something so disappointing as this book you just can't help but share an honest opinion.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun app --- not much skill involved. strangely addictive.<br />better than wasting money in the arcade and it 's free. get it.
B003JACW6I|5.0|Absolutely love the Gilmore Girls and only wish it was still going. The final season was as excellent as the previous seasons. Someday I have to buy the entire set with all the seasons.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This product is very helpful to wake you up I really liked it because When I have to get up it wakes me up on time and it's just a matter of seconds I feel energetic and don't feel like snoozing so Now you can wake up on time and won't feel like snoozing at all when you get up you will be fresh and ready to get to work or wherever it is you have to be.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|I've read several books now by lead singers and band members from the 80s' LA rock scene.  And in some ways their simular to one another.  This book was much different to me.  Ozzy seems very honest about his hard early years in England and the adventures that have led him to where he is today.  And in a very, very funny way of story telling.  I enjoyed reading the whole book to the very last page.  I give it 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool game I love it Keeps boredom away play for hours and hours woo hoo thank you for the game. awesome awesome game with lots to do
B003VANOFY|4.0|Really great sound.  I love watching movies with 7.1 surround sound at night and not disturbing the neighbors.  Even the non 7.1 function on them produces great stereo sound for music.  I mostly use them for Voice Chat for gaming.  Really good sound for both Voice and in game sounds, but takes some adjustment for both at the same time.  Games sounds can drown out voice chat at times without adjustments, usually from within the game.  Also, 7.1 in shooters is just pure awesomeness.<br />Cons: Just a couple.  The 3 side G buttons are somewhat limited by the software it comes with.  However, I haven't really explored the plugin options available, so there might be a solution to this.  Also the mute mic button on the side is a bit pointless since all you have to do to mute the mic is move it to the up position.  Would've been better if this could be a mute button for the output on the headset, so you can mute whatever is playing if someone needs to talk to you in person.  Again, there could be a plugin available that does this, I just haven't really looked.<br /><br />Over all, a really great headset and worth the money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very good read.  Nothing in the book that would comprise any secrets.  Gives you the amount of thought and planning that goes into an op.  Good job son.  The nation thanks you.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|Not only was I ready to leave about 15 minutes into this disaster; I had a hard time watching the grotesque characters on the screen.  I kept a close eye on my watch the whole time and rejoiced when the movie was over.  If I could take away about 3/4 of one star I would.
1451648537|5.0|Absolutely compelling.<br /><br />The intersection between madness and genius has been chronicled many times (see, for example, Kay Redfield Jamison's \\"Touched by Fire\\").  Here, Isaacson doesn't presume to deliver clinical diagnoses, but his narrative suggests that Jobs was manic-depressive (huge mood swings), attention-deficit disordered (superhuman focus on things that interested him, but bored distraction otherwise), and  a classic narcissistic personality (grandiosity, abusive treatment of others,  self-exemption from conventional rules, dualist view of the world--everything was either \\"perfect\\" and \\"the best\\" or \\"shit\\",  and great charisma).<br /><br />Jobs, as portrayed here, made me think of another manic-depressive world-changing narcissist:  Alexander the Great.  They had in common another trait that was decisive--what Isaacson calls Jobs's \\"reality distortion field.\\"  He willed the universe to bend itself to his vision.<br /><br /> It probably killed him.  He tried to will himself well for nine months after his cancer diagnosis, instead of having the surgery that, if timely done, might have saved him.  But that same trait brought about the MacIntosh, Pixar, the iPod, the iPad, and the iPhone, collectively amounting to a figurative conquest of the known world that Alexander accomplished literally.<br /><br />Jobs was so innovative in so many ways that it's difficult to list the most important.  Among them:  combining liberal arts with technology; focusing on the customer rather than the technology; refusing to do market research--\\"they'll know what they want when they see it\\"; obsession with beauty and simplicity--a rare trait among techno-geeks.<br /><br />The book has the feel of having been rushed.  It is laxly edited  and sometimes not up to Isaacson's capacity for elegant expression.  But these are minor gripes.  This is the best kind of biography:  derived from hard, street-pounding research, and filled with original insight.  Read it, and understand.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this app is pretty fun and has some challenges once you get into it I recommend it.  If you looking for a small challenge and something relitively fun have at it.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Rather fun, but i Want more levels to play! The missions can get rather hard on medium, i played through the second half of the missions on easy.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|I disagree with Tom C., I love Michele Rodriguez, she is a strong actress and a good latina role model.  She is graceful and pretty.  The story is just more than being a Marine.  Being a U.S. Marine is honorable and brave,  but the story is really about human nature and how war shows no favorites.  Eckhart and all the cast did good.  I loved the movie.  I have downloaded to my kindle and will watch over and over again.  The enemy doesn't matter - alien or human - it was how other Marines viewed the Staff Sargent and assumed he got his men killed not realizing war takes with no mercy by killing all his men including Lockett's brother.  By the end of the movie everyone knows the truth and what a true military soldier is - relentless.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|After watching runaway bride, I just wanted to see Pretty woman again...It never fails to make me feel good even after all these years...
B009329ZF2|1.0|A sad day for the motion picture arts! Battleship appears to be the work of simpletons for an easily duped population of moviegoers. The script is childish and the computer generated effects were sloppy. Oh yes, the acting was crap!<br /><br />I walked away from this one feeling completely cheated.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Great book! It kept me engaged. Love the concept. Very imaginative. I recommend to anyone. It wasn't at all what I expected it to be.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|Some areas were overly dramatized; other than that, it was a very well produced show.<br />The villain actually played a similar, creepy role in at least one movie that had to do with a young girl. It does not deserve four stars in my book due to its too Hollywood style, predictable ending of the thriller part--problems get solved, bad guys get caught, etc. But the ending of the movie itself was very nice, almost gives one the taste of enjoying a short story. The female character was quite charming in her brutal honesty, and dark integrity. You will like it, --it's better than many junks we get on this side of the Atlantic.<br />Again, the phrase \\"dark integrity\\" (my coinage, :-)) comes to my mind when I think of the girl with the dragon tattoo.
B002DKF57S|4.0|Released way back in 1978 being one of Eno's earlier ambient works, this was to me the \\"runt\\" of the litter. The distortion and crackling associated with some of the higher frequencies meant that I didn't play this LP (1978!) as often as I would have liked.<br />I loved the content but it felt second rate, as though Eno himself considered it unnecessary to fix the problems. Even upon its initial release on CD those distortions remained, sounding worse than ever.<br />Thankfully all these years later those distracting noises have gone and with the remastering many subtle nuances surface for the first time.<br /><br />Bravo!!
B000HF6XKO|3.0|The movie is convincing and I suppose it's so not because it shows something unique, but because we already have a popular consciousness about collusion between politics and big businesses. That we are already familiar and, in some fashion, comfortable with the idea that our intelligence and  other branches of government were, are and will be involved in some capacity or another, with manipulating the world economic and political affairs--even if it means selective elimination of powerful figures beyond our borders. However, the style of storytelling in the show was very poor, despite good acting from all involved. Who should I blame? I think the director and screen-writer are to share the burden. Yet, they took up a complex subject matter to deal with, so this weakness is forgivable. But, a B is a B on paper. So, a three star quality is a three star quality. Those who are wondering about my vague notion of the story's weakness, I suggest you watch it. Kind of hard to pin-point, but the transitions of the scenes are too fast and could be more coherent. At the same time, I can assure you that you won't miss much if you spend your time watching something else. Thanks for reading.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Michael Connelly's character Harry Bosch really comes to life in this story. I had a hard time putting it down. Just when I thought I had the murderer figured out something proved their innocense. What an interesting climax to find out who really killed Harry's mom when he was a boy. Harry Bosch stories are one of my favorites and this one reminds me why I like them and this one is no different
B0007TKNII|5.0|Yes, I found the movie to be a mythic tale, or should I say,\\"tales?\\"--of masculine feminine, of lovers confused amidst the conflict between love and power , of a beauty and her tormented beast, and ultimately a tragic tale. I never read the original French novel and this is the only version I enjoyed. The production is so rich in its contents and presentation that it's difficult to give credit to a single performer for the wholesome experience. The soundtrack was awesome, and despite the occasional humor, the tragedy never failed to claim on the audience's emotion. What did actually win in the end, love or chivalry? Are they really that different? What was really important to the \\"Phantom\\"--love for the beloved or the love itself?<br />Occasionally, towards the end of the movie, I kept thinking about the Ugly Duckling of Hans Andersen. The movie brought me closer to the conviction I have carried within me that deep down, most of us carry a beast, frustrated in its solitary castle, awaiting a beauty to see through the outer layer and break the curse of solitude, as if a healing awaiting to happen.<br />I encourage you to watch it.<br />Excellent work. Thanks to all involved with the project.
B004P8A7J2|4.0|The ultimate junky film....  If you're thinking that heroin (or similar drugs) are recreational, hip, or that you can control your use (abuse responsibly and even make some quick cash, this film might just scare you straight.  All the characters, from the upper class beautiful and talented girl with dreams of being a fashion designer to her gorgeous boyfriend (who just wants to make some money so he can change his life) to his best friend, who actually comes out lucky as he might get some rehab while in jail, begin as good-hearted people.<br /><br />This film truly shows how easy and quickly one can fall from the \\"grace\\" of occasional chemical euphoria.  The main character's fate is worse than an O.D.  As is his girlfriends downfall from creative, happy, beauty with everything going for her to a life of degradation due to her desire for drugs and fear of getting sick from withdrawals.<br /><br />Recommended for any young person who thinks that he or she has self-control and a \\"those things only happen to uneducated, poor folk from the ghetto\\" attitude.<br /><br />The only thing that shows that the director or someone has no experience in abuse of heroin is in the artistic editing depicting the injection of opiates (heroin, in this case), the pupils of the guy getting high are shown dialating (getting huge!)  post injection.<br /><br />Heroin, as well as all other opiates, constrict the pupils and cause Pin-point pupils, even in dim light.  In fact, one way doctors can tell if someone is detoxing or withdrawing from high doses of opiates is that their pupils will dilate.  Drugs that dialate pupils are cocaine, some psychedelics, and other compounds that I don't know about.<br /><br />Great Film, very intense, and quite sad.  But....  If you are thinking about experimenting with opiates, this is a must see.  It could save your life.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I found myself thinking about this book while going about my day. Love the writing style which pushed me to read another book by this author. The ending, though, was flat.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|THIS BOOK IS WAS EXCELENT..FAR FAR BETTER THAN SNIPER ELITE. I DO NOT RECOMEMD SNIPER ELITE .SNIPER ELITE WAS VERY BORING AND DRUG ON WITH TRIVIAL DETAILS . I'LL TAKE GOOD OLD AMERICAN ANY DAY.

0345803485|2.0|Honestly, all of these people who gave bad reviews may as well just come out and say it.  We didn't read it on a whim...we read it because we heard it was erotic.  Like everyone else, the whole first 5-8 chapters I kept asking myself why I was reading it and kept telling myself to put it down because it was so poorly written.  It was like a inexperienced teenagers view of what SM is about.  Because it had done so well with sales, I insisted that it had to get better....it really didn't.  I was entirely non-climactic and drug on and on.  I can't say how many times we had to hear about how the main character was confused...in great detail.  If you read the words, her confusion is described in exactly the same way chapter after chapter.  Huge disappointment and I WILL NOT give the author the benefit of the doubt and read the next two books.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought Gone Girl was an extremely creatively written book.  There were many unexpected twists and turns.  The ending was truly a surprise.  I read most evenings and I found that I couldn't put this one down.  I have recommended it to all my friends.  I think it would be a great book club book for discussion.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I found the story very interesting!! Kept me glued to my Kindle Fire for hours- cannot wait for Book 2 to come out!! Keep up the good work Anthony!!
0553386794|5.0|Gritty, dirty, creepy, bloody, realistic, suspenseful, and very epic.  George RR Martin's Game of Thrones is any fantasy lover's dream come true.  There is nothing here not to love (unless you have a weak stomach). If you think the HBO series is fantastic, the books will leave you breathless, sleep-deprived, and begging for more.  In my opinion, Martin's Game of Thrones / Song of Ice and Fire series is the very best in Fantasy literature today.
B006L4MWVE|5.0|Far better movie than the hunger games, so long as you don't mind it being in Japanese with subtitles. Movie was in premium shape, sleeve was a little rough, but case and disk were almost mint. Arrived early as well. Great price too
0756405890|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is one of the most talented fantasy writers to come along in many years. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is original, magical, and truly unforgettable. This first book as well as it's equally great follow-up \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" are books that no reader should miss.  Definitely in my top 5 fantasy picks.  The Name of the Wind is simply OUTSTANDING.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I was surprised when I watched this movie and enjoyed it. The critics and some people trashed it but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story wasn't boring. The effects were good and I was entertained the whole time. Goes to show, that not always, people will agree on something. You should watch the movie yourself and make up your own mind. But I think you will like it and not be disappointed with it.
145162445X|3.0|Maybe it was because I listened to the book on tape or because I have no background in physics or astronomy, but I just didn't understand a lot of the book.  I don't think of myself as a stupid person, but I certainly felt that way for a lot of the book.  Reading it makes me admire the people who have written reviews talking about how accessible the book was.  I was not able to access most of the information in the book.  Hope other readers have more success than I did!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie is the best superhero film of the year and maybe the best one so far. It is brillant how they tied all the other marvel superhero films Iron man,Captain America, Thor, the Hulk and connected them into this movie. The story line was good, the special effect were done well. The movie works.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a very detailed, beautiful, intriguing and wonderfully mysterious game. I loved it! I highly recommend it for mystery seekers.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked all of The Hunger Games books because they were different and they held my interest all the way through. Mockingjay was probably my least favorite book of the series- it was pretty gory and there was too much killing and dying, considering that this is a \\"young adult\\" book. Still, it was hard to put down.
B0053O89JM|4.0|Although lacking some of the strength in writing that made this series great it's worth having as a bookend to a great story. Come on, you have to find out how your favorite sociopathic doctor ends up --- seriously, you can't put it down!<br /><br />I especially enjoyed how the story wound down about the characters like Chase and Foreman.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please add your vote.
B00846REIS|4.0|Interesting start to a trilogy I'm looking forward to read.  It follows the tend of Fifty Shades of Grey, yet it has it's own flavor.  The writing is definitely a step up from fifty shades and the story follows more fluently.  The male character is dark, sexy and intriguing, I can't wait for the second book to find out more about Gideon Cross.  Very steamy sex scenes yet not so original.  All in all, If you are a fan of fifty shades of grey, you will enjoy this book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app.  worked lkke a charm.  no problems with it at all.  verry easy to use.  loved the radar feature.  although a bit sliw

B007SNMYNS|5.0|This book made me really think about what I eat.  I found it to be very interesting and thought provoking.

B000TYWAUA|5.0|Stii one the most action packed movies I've seen the last few years.  Acting was great, the download never lagged and it was just a great movie
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put this down. What started out as a dysfunctional family story evolved into a more serious  plot turnaround. Liked the alternating chapters by character. The story moves back and forth from the present to the past.  The author gets you into the minds of the characters.
B000LYXLI8|5.0|Well, its not quite a seque, but Suzie went right into Rocket Man on the vinyl release, no breaks between the songs.<br />On all CD versions there is a 2-3 second gap between songs, I know it's nitpicking, but I like to listen to the album thee way it ws originally released, that's just me, hopefully there are others that feel the same way I do.<br /><br />On to the album, one of EJ's best, thats for sure, what a lineup of great tunes:<br /><br />side One:<br /><br />Honky Cat (a popular ,love the banjo playing by Davey Johnstone)<br />Mellow (great elcetric violin solo by Jean Luc Ponty)<br />I Think I'm Ging To Kill Myself (this is a staple at Elton's live shows with just him and Ray Cooper)<br />Suzie (Dramas) (a great rocker, also the B-side of Rocket Man)<br />Rocket Man (cool Synth by David Henschel)<br /><br />side two:<br /><br />Salvation<br />Slave<br />Amy (more great electric violin by Jean)<br />Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters (not released as a single, but got lots of airplay)<br />Hercules (was gonna be releases as a single, but never was, my favorite track on side two, Gus Dudgeon plays an instrument called a rhino whistle)
1439102430|2.0|I have read all of Kathy Reichs's books and enjoyed her earlier works.  However, the last few have been absolutely poorly written and not enjoyable to read.  \\"Flash and Bones\\" was a great reading disappointment and her latest book, \\"Bones Are Forever\\" was just another awful read.  The story got so boring at the middle of the book, I struggled each night to read a chapter on my Kindle.  It is apparent between her profession and TV episodes that little thought and time is being devoted to her writing.<br /><br />Do not waste your time and money on her latest literary attempt.
B0002VK66U|4.0|JLT came out from Rainbow with his first stop his solo debut Rescue You. It had a modest MTV hit with \\"Endlessly\\", but not much critical response & wouldn't be given a follow-up until 1995. Though, by then, JLT's prolific work as a session musician would put thirty albums on his resume. By the time of his second solo album he'd built up lots of studio experience with an array of musical styles, had some new writings partners, let alone moved away from the shadow of Rainbow both musicially & personally. On Rescue You most of the tracks were co-written by keyboardist Al Greenwood, formerly of Foreigner. The outcome echoes of Foreigner (i.e. \\"Losing You\\", \\"Endlessly\\") with embarressing abandon. Part of it is the now dated sounding stabs of keyboards that take prominent ground over the guitars which are lost in the mix at times. It has a very 80's AOR sheen, though considering he'd just worked with guitar demon Ritchie Blackmore it's probably better that he stayed away from guitar heavy music for the moment. Sadly, the album doesn't have a kick. The material sounds too dated & too weak & definetly too repetitious in its feeling & style to ever truly rise. But, JLT shines above it with a great range of vocal nuances. Though, on first listen one is liable not to hear anything but JLT's voice falling into the generic music & not out from under it. Thus, on one hand, this is not the best JLT album to recommend as its not a strong album musically, later albums would often bring in multiple songwriters to their benefit, but his voice is rich & enjoyable once one gets past the 80's sheen. Actually, on the second half of the album it's incredibly nuanced & you can feel him putting his whole body into the notes riding it forward like a boxer. Let alone the man is pitch & tone perfect as always. There's a reason he's a prolific session backing vocalist & its not just due to self-promotion. In many ways I'm reminded of Michael Bolton's first few albums, when he was still a guitar playing rocker. He sings his heart out but the material just isn't there & too much time spend on radio friendly love ballads. JLT has the same problem. But, this isn't so bad of a first step out into the great solo unknown, though its obvious why it didn't have a bigger impact. JLT fans should pick up this first release if they're at all interested in his career & anyone else probably won't regret it too much. Anyways, it is Al Greenwood of ... Foreigner, not just any old keyboardist.playing rocker. He sings his heart out but the material just isn't there & too much time spend on radio friendly love ballads. JLT has the same problem.

B008OOYALE|2.0|There should be a warning on this game that Kindle Fire users are severely disadvantaged compared to iOS and even other Android users.  Kindle Fire does not get the Goals to earn Gold.  Updates are available for iOS to boost coin production,  so in-game prices are outrageous for other users.  It can take weeks for new users to earn enough to clear more space on the island, which is the only way to have room for the dragons you are breeding.<br /><br />Great game... for iOS.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have watched this clever and entertaining comedy series from the first season.  It just gets better each season.  Thanks for making my Thursdays the best of the week.  I think all the actors fit well and were chosen well for the parts they play. I have admired Cuoco's acting ability since she was on 8 Simple Rules. And I remember Galecki and Gilbert from Rosanne when they were playing teenager parts.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|I admit I didn't finish this book.  Early on it seemed rather far fetched to me, but I gave up when her first indication of pregnancy was \\"the bizarre being-poked-by-sharp-edges-of-uncrushed-tortilla-chips feeling in my gut.\\" I've had four pregnancies and been around a lot of pregnant women.  This symptom is a new one and she's the first person I've heard of who went out and purchased a pregnancy test kit based on this singular symptom.  She also had just eaten in a Mexican restaurant.  Maybe some chips fell down her blouse.  This book reminded me too much of \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" by James Frey and both Oprah and I were fooled by that one. I would't even give her one star for her writing and story but I'll give her five stars for making money.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|What idiot said K. Stewart could act?  I guess it is obvious to all now how she gets the parts.  I think I saw her blink once and smile once all through the movie.  Her only parts involved running and riding a horse.  And even then she had no emotion.  I almost turned the movie off until Theron came in as queen and saved the day.  C. Theron was the only performance worth watching.  I have admired her acting ability for many years and she did not disappoint. The action and graphics around the castle were interesting.  The Dark Forest was boring and perdictable.

B009AMAK0E|3.0|In this 2012 offering, Clint Eastwood makes his return to the big screen since the blockbuster, \\"Gran Torino\\".  Eastwood plays Gus Lobel, an ancient, ailing baseball scout for the Atlanta Braves, who is perhaps embarking on his last scouting road trip, as younger Braves management is beginning to see him as an anachronism rather than an asset.  Fortunately, his scouting boss happens to be his good friend and supporter, Pete (played by John Goodman), who suspects Gus is having physical problems.  Pete calls up Gus's estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), an aspiring corporate lawyer, and urges her to go with her father on this last road trip.  Being fiercely independent, Gus resents the intrusion of his daughter into his job, but after his anger subsides, he stubbornly accepts her at his side.  Gus's job is to scout a highly touted top high school baseball prospect and decide whether \\"Bo\\" should be the Braves number one pick in the upcoming draft.  It readily becomes apparent that Gus' failing vision puts him at a distinct disadvantage of evaluating Bo, so daughter Mickey steps in to be her father's failing eyes.  In the process, she tries to reconnect with her father and figure out why he seemed to reject her and ignore her after the death of her mother when she was just 6 years old.  She also rediscovers her true love of baseball, and learns from her father the intricacies on how to scout players, from the flow of their swings to the sound of the fastball hitting a mitt.  Intermixed into the relationship is  Johnny Flanagan, (Justin Timberlake), a rival scout who takes a definite love interest in Gus's daughter, Mickey.<br /><br />Although the movie stars Clint Eastwood, clearly, this is Amy Adams' movie.  She absolutely shines in her role of \\"Mickey\\" (named after Gus's favorite Yankee player), and she single-handedly rescues this film from being a mediocre film about an aging old man, to a very relevant film on how a father and daughter reconcile their past hurts and differences.  To his credit, Eastwood knows to step back from the limelight and let Adam's star shine.  While baseball plays a major role as the backdrop of this movie, it is the troubled parent-child relationship that is the core of this film. Amy Adams is nothing but terrific and her performance may very well be Oscar-worthy.  Justin Timberlake, as Johnny, is also remarkably well cast as Mickey's love interest.  I thought Timberlake could only sing; but his acting performance is more than adequate, and his relationship with the emotionally confused and tentative Mickey carries this movie forward in a huge way. A strong supporting cast, namely John Goodman, shores up this movie as well.<br /><br />The ending is particularly satisfying, and while all the questions about the troubled relationship between parent and child are never fully answered, clearly, the relationship is healed, and there is a promising future for both Gus, Mickey, and Johnny.<br /><br />I hope this is not Eastwood's last film performance.  He has some emotionally engaging scenes where he really shows his range as an actor.  He has so much more to give yet to the film industry.  I hope he finds another role that allows his diverse talents to shine.<br /><br />While probably not generally appealing to the crucial 16-24 age group, (thus not a box office smash hit), I believe many \\"Baby Boomers\\" will appreciate this movie, not only for the portrayal of the angrily aging parent, but for the reconciliation that is possible in all relationships.<br /><br />(Rated PG-13 for language).<br /><br />koneand differences.

He has some emotionally engaging scenes where he really shows his range as an actor.  He has so much more to give yet to the film industry.  I hope he finds another role that allows his diverse talents to shine.<br /><br />While probably not generally appealing to the crucial 16-24 age group, (thus not a box office smash hit), I believe many \\"Baby Boomers\\" will appreciate this movie, not only for the portrayal of the angrily aging parent, but for the reconciliation that is possible in all relationships.<br /><br />(Rated PG-13 for language).<br /><br />kone
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Loved it! I knew I would because I gush about the Forever Girl every chance I get. It put me right back in the story. A different perspective is what I needed from Hamilton, and she delivered. I loved her style and the lyrical use of words. Perfect, can't wait for the next one!!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Not as detailed as the book but it represented it well. I wish it had included more characters from the book. It did an excellant job giving us the basics of the story. It made for a good preset for the next book.
B005L12SB2|4.0|I just got my Billy Joel Complete Album Collection and that was done the right way. Each CD sleeve looks like the original album.... with a sleeve insert to boot. These Kansas sleeves are just that... cheap cardboard sleeves. That's prime for scratched CD's in due time. I have all the remasters from a few years ago and I will keep those because I think the ones in this package are going to get ruined over time.<br /><br />Yes, Monolith sounds fantastic! That was the only reason that I bought this. It was nice to have the discs released after that, too, but Monolith is the key here.<br /><br />So, if you don't mind the cheap packaging (which is the norm these days thanks to the enviro nutz) then this collection will suit you fine.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has been a wonderful read as was the one before it! I'm looking forward to reading book three!
B007REABAG|4.0|But great sounding stuff, especially the CD's that haven't been remastered. The packaging is crappy like it was for the Kansas box set. Get ready for scratched or scuffed CD's in due time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good ending to the trilogy. Read and re-read the abduction scenes and hospital scenes. Could have done without the two extras that were tacked on but they were ok.
B008BO61BE|5.0|Because it has live tracks not release before. Plus, the DVD is absolutely killer.<br /><br />The DVD performance is inspiring and very powerful. Not to mention, the film looks good for its day. I feel sorry for Triumph who had to follow the Priest. I'm not taking anything away from Triumph, a great band in their own right, but this performance by JP looks tough to follow.<br /><br />As an aside, the track Devils Child is not from the San Antonio show as the other live tracks. It's the same as the one on the 2001 remaster.... and it's also the audio of the song from the video they made back in 1982 recorded in Memphis.
B001DRF84W|1.0|Only movie that has has ever made me walk out of the theater. I hated it. Most boring movie involving super heroes from a comic ever made.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I hadn't really thought I would enjoy the Hunger Games story, but as it had such brilliant reviews I gave it a go.  After reading book 1 I just had to get books 2 and 3 and thoroughly enjoyed them.  Not the greatest literature of all time of course, but an interesting and stimulating read, and maybe, just maybe, a warning for our future.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I love this movie, thats why I bought it : ) If you like magic tricks or elaborate story lines than youll love this movie!
1847879071|3.0|Being one if 4 required text, I find this book ago be fast moving and complex. Clearly the efforts to oversimplify ain't working too well for me. However, the professors purchased slides help greatly.
B006UAWH2S|4.0|Surprising, I wanted to watch a steamy romance, but it is a futuristic portrayal of the downfall of the human race, in a very creative and surprising way.  Very good movie.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|The music is soothing, the game is interesting and challenging. I've never been great at games like these, so the hints come in handy sometimes!  Good FAOTD.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not put it down! Well written and made me feel as I was there......I didn't feel any secrets were given away. Too many things are discussed everyday that should be not mentioned. Let the money go to the wounded soldiers. They fought for our freedom and need our support.
B004IFYMWK|4.0|Fair Game is based on the true story of CIA agent Valerie Plame, who shares some of the qualities exhibited by Gary Oldham's character in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  Both are stunningly skilled operatives.  Most of the story you know:  The Bush administration had decided to go to war in Iraq.  Seeking reasons to justify an attack, it seized on a report that the nation of Niger (not Nigeria) had sold uranium to Iraq.  Joseph Wilson, a former ambassador to Niger, was sent to seek such evidence.  He found none.  In fact, he learned that such sales would have been physically impossible.  His report was ignored.  War was begun using the nonexistent uranium sales as cause.  He wrote an article in the New York Times reporting the truth.  In order to discredit him, someone in the administration leaked the information to Chicago Sun-Times columnist Robert Novak that Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, was a CIA agent.  Eventually, Cheney aide, Scooter Libby, was tried and convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury, sentenced to prison, and had his sentence commuted by Bush.  The part of the story you probably do not know was the \\"collateral\\" damage.  Plame's sensitive work in the Middle East was disrupted and as many as 70 of her informants were killed.  The Plame-Wilson family (including young twins) came close to breakup.<br />Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are excellent as Plame and Wilson, even looking remarkably like them.  The film does not change the names of any principals, uses actual footage of administrative figures, and even closes with footage of Plame herself testifying before congress.  Here are a couple of ifs:  If Wilson had kept quiet, Plame's CIA work wouldn't have been destroyed.  On the other hand, if the Bush administration hadn't suppressed Wilson's information and smeared Wilson and Plame, there might have been no Iraq War.  A story worth contemplating.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|A must read, absolutely beautifully written. They are not books that I would normally read,thought I would try something different. Very hard to put down. The trilogy has everything, mystery, adventure,lots of action and a little love. Thoroughly enjoyed.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is one beautiful movie.  I would be happy to merely watch it without knowing anything that was going on, because the cinematography is so stunning, every shot a painting or a portrait.  It is also beautifully acted and a wonderful puzzle to try to figure out.  I want to see it once more, and I think I can then get everything straight.  This is mostly a quiet spy story.  No car chases, not a lot of violence, yet a sense of tension, and mostly the need to sort this all out and discover the mole.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|The Sun Also Rises - Hemingway gave a glimpse into a lifestyle today's youth would doubtless disdain as silly and prosaic.  What he actually provided generations to come was a lesson in how it was to be decadent, talented and hard-working.  He proved, also, that the nature of the beast hasn't changed a bit.  Worth a third time around for me.  I am re-reading Fitzgerald and Pound again as well.  Yes, I'm no spring chicken!  Read this time around on my Kindle from Amazon.
B005V1WYZC|5.0|I find most Hollywood comedies these days not at all funny. The French are much better.  This film replaces the usual raunchy slapstick with fine acting (Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Marisa Tomei and the wondrous Ryan Gosling) and is laugh-out-loud funny.  The excellent screenplay of two generations seeking and finding love has two unforgettable surprise scenes.  Don't miss this one.
0646497855|5.0|I just bought it, and it arrived two days ago. It is really good tips and i like it very much.

0307352145|5.0|Cain's book on introversion does more than give introverts their long overdue due; it clarifies some of the egregious problems going on in U.S. culture today (like the global financial crash) and how we might make a perceptual shift in values to overcome them.  Cain explains how Dale Carnegie's rise from farm boy to salesman to public-speaking icon reflects our cultural shift at the turn of the twentieth century from a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality.  This shift moved us from the ideal of being disciplined and honorable to making an impression, being a performer - people who not only sell products but sell themselves, focused not on inner virtue but outer charm.  Cain tells the story of how we made this shift without realizing what was sacrificed.  She lists what the world would have missed without introverts, e.g., the theories of gravity and relativity, Chopin's nocturnes, Harry Potter, and gives a pep talk to introverts, the approximately one-third of the population who have received short shrift for so long.<br /><br />Here is my summary of the pep talk:<br /><br />Introverts are more quiet, resolute and have the kind of strength that not everyone can see.  They tend to trust their intuitions.  They have the tenacity to solve complex problems.  They enjoy relative freedom from the temptations of superficial prizes like money and status.  They may feel underestimated by those around them (and often are) but when focused on a project that they care about, their energy seems boundless.  They are better at making a plan, staying with a plan, being very disciplined.<br /><br />Introverts are not that good at small talk, even bored by it, but enjoy talking about values or morality.  They are highly empathic, have thinner boundaries separating them from other people's emotions.  They tend to have strong consciences and often focus on subjects like personal problems, which others consider too heavy.  They tend to be  spiritual or philosophical rather than materialistic or hedonistic, love music, art, beauty, feel strong emotions,  and notice subtleties that others miss, like another person's shift in mood.  They don't need as much stimulation because they are highly sensitive to stimulation.  Others feel freer to confide their problems to them and feel understood by them.  They make good sales persons because they listen better and ask good questions.<br /><br />Extroverts are more prone to overconfidence not matched by ability.  They would do well to listen to introverts when making decisions.

1605092762|5.0|To learn about poverty, Paul Polak goes to poor people where they live, focuses on learning from them without assuming he knows, and asks for details of their lives.  He was stunned when he learned that people in the World Bank, or in research labs in Stanford, or in FEMA offices of U.S. government, etc., seldom if ever actually visit the people on site that they are commissioned to serve.  This book is based on Polak's interviews with  three thousand poor farm families and his listening carefully to learn everything he could about the specific context in which they lived and worked.  First, he learned that the most direct and cost-effective first step out of poverty is to find ways for poor people to increase their income.  That way they can make their own choices.  Second, the most effective way to help poor people increase their income is to bring profitability to grassroots enterprises like small farms and small businesses.  This is where design comes in.  Polak wants to change the way design is done by designing for the 90%.  That means designing what the customer (poor people) prefer and can pay for.  (The so-called \\"experts\\"  are worse than useless because of their preconceived notions.)  Schumacher's \\"small is beautiful\\" is still true and Polak has added, \\"cheap is beautiful too.\\"  Polak's work over the past twenty-five years has helped millions of farming families invest in their own futures.  This book traces his journeys to his revolutionary process which is downright practical, simple to implement, and astonishingly effective.  In my book, the man is a saint.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child has returned Reacher to the present after excursions into his earlier days.  And he's just as good as ever.  It's a good story, plenty of twists and builds up the tension.  Can't wait to find out if he ever gets to Virginia - and what the girl is like!  Only problem with a new Lee Child book - Once I start nothing gets done until I'm finished.  Next one please!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love love loveddd this on my iPod touch! I would recommend it to anyone! It looks pointless (which it kind of is) but it's so entertaining! LOVE IT.
0385344333|3.0|Because I love the Reacher novels, I cannot write a trashing review. I agree with most of the comments by the disappointed readers. I agree there was too much narrative, not enough action. I agree that the bad guys weren't bad enough. The plot seemed put together just to slam certain ethnics, and while we may all be sympathetic with anti-terrorism and some people might be anti-Middle East, this portrayal of this group did not compel me to hate them more. I felt a shrugging boredom during Jack's long ponderings over the source and abilities of the bad guys. The only good thing Reacher proclaimed was that they were well organized and clean. True opponents are equal in degree of power or resources or something so that there is really a fight at hand. In the final scene, Reacher had 24 opponents, but it may as well have been one, a very poor one at that.<br /><br />Prior to his entering the bunker, one of the good guys died and it was no big deal. Reacher's expression of vengeance was not believable. I pictured Rambo rising from the mud when Reacher took out the two guys in the truck who had come to claim the dead body. Machine-like, passionless. Speaking of passion. There was NONE!!! No sexual tension, no recollection by Reacher about his past loves. He is traveling to Virginia to meet a woman whose voice appealed to him. As Reacher broke into the bunker, I felt the excitement mount, but there was no real payoff. With all the descriptions and guessing and lecturing (Lee Child's lecturing to the reader), the book went on far too long. I would rather have seen Reacher being reacher for an extra hour than to wait out the long car rides and stupid storming of the empty house.<br /><br />Maybe Tom Cruise has  influenced Lee Child. Maybe Tom's stiff, unnatural acting has infiltrated Child's writing style. I can picture Tom in this role (NOT PHYSICALLY). Cool, clean, all power and no heart; a little man trying to be big and bad. Reacher is the big man here, but in a very small role.<br /><br />Anyway, I've watched some Lee Child interview videos and he himself seems cool and calm. He lately seems possessed of a notion that he is on top and doesn't have to prove anything. That is just an observation.. I could be wrong about this.<br /><br />I am disappointed in the book mostly because I really waited for this one. Needed a break from assigned reading and looked forward to some substantial fluff. There were moments that I laughed out loud, because I knew what Reacher would do. I could actually speak the lines before I heard them... we know what he and his kind of people are going to do. I was optimistic after the tedious car ride to the bunker, when finally the action began, but it was just more silly. Rambo again. And, Rambo has its place. But these books, up till now, have been better than that.<br /><br />The idea of the FBI agent being outside the bunker driving back and forth three times and flashing car lights - well that's just ludicrous since the bad guys had perches and long range rifles and would have noted the car and blown it up. That is just one of the ridiculous things.<br /><br />The invasion of the terrorists' house, the looking for McDonald's and the approach by three people to take over the terrorist cell is simply stupid. Then, Reacher says, \\"deal with it\\" when one agent is shot but he risks his life to rescue another.<br /><br />But I will await the next one.. consider this one a blip, though I wish I had waited until the price dropped and didn't waste a credit.<br /><br />Regarding the women in the book. I think LC is trying to do too much. Even though the women were his \\"superiors\\" as they were active in their jobs and Reacher was not, they deferred to him automatically. Strong women, if that is what he is trying to champion, would have kicked his \\"a...\\" and taken over. I don't think he needed to add women just for \\"political correctness\\" if the women were powerless and weak because it is sort of an underhanded way of announcing that women are powerless and weak! - they need a man, etc. I am not going to belabor that, because, frankly, I don't care if the women in these books are \\"correctly\\" portrayed. This is fantasy. There should have been some kind of sexual something. Did Reacher lose his \\"stuff?\\" He acknowledged the women were attractive. He saw one of them in some state of undress and still nothing sprang to mind? Bah!<br /><br />In summary, I liked parts of it very much. An aspect of Lee Child's work that I do like is the history/geography lessons he weaves into his stories. And this book had plenty - a tad too much for my taste, but I won't abandon the series unless this is becomes a trend.<br /><br />I, too, am looking forward, albeit with a very jaded sense of humor, to watching Tom play Jack. I will go to the movie to laugh and to look at the audience's reaction. I wish I could know how many people are readers of the series vs. the number of people who are going to the movie without prior expectations. If he does it right, Tom might have a bankable franchise on his hands - and good for Lee Child. If Tom bombs, I hope he doesn't take Lee with him.f announcing that women are powerless and weak! - they need a man, etc. I am not going to belabor that, because, frankly, I don't care if the women in these books are \\"correctly\\" portrayed.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|My family and I really enjoy this app. It's fun and challenging at the same time. only downfall is that there is not a hint option to help with the harder puzzle games,  other than that this app is great.
B007BZM30M|5.0|The first time I heard it I couldn't get it out of my mind. I would be humming it all day long. I just had to purchase it so I could listen to it on my Phone, tablet, and in my car.

B000JPRPAO|4.0|I especially like the definition of the word, FINE. Enjoyed the beautiful scenes during the boat chase in Venice. I'm usually not an action movie fan but the plot was good in this one.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|once u run out of coins it takes 30 seconds to get another coin. and all u do is sit and wait. and if u leave the game it is 9 minutes per coin. and hours for it to fill back up to ur maximum coins. I thought maybe there would be a puzzle game to play for more coins, but there's not.  so I find it very boring waiting for coins.

B0061PEAUY|3.0|Have always enjoyed her books but this one went into to much detail about bones and autopsy details that were a little over the top for a reader who just wants to enjoy a book and good story without all that detail.  P. Cornwell is also doing this and have quit reading her books.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written, all things considered.  Very informative and shows a high degree of credibility and truthfulness, something that is lacking in all previous accounts.  It certainly dispels the warrior myth of this administration!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Although I have have not read the full series it is easy to see the resemblance with Tolkien, but not nearly as complicated. I only have about an hour or so per day to read and I do wish it were more but I do enjoy the tme I do have. I look forward to each day and I find myself sneeking a few extra minutes a day with my Kindle just to see what happens next. I marvel at the emagination it took to write such compeling stories. I highly recommend the book.

B0073XORLU|4.0|It's been a long wait for Tull/Anderson fans - 1999 was the last proper Tull album, with a Christmas album (featuring 3 new Anderson compositions) and Ian Anderson solo album about 8 years ago being the last new material since.  This release is listed as \\"Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson\\" - musically it SOUNDS like a band release (and a Tull release at that): the arrangements focus on a full rock band, with nice classic organ sounds, acoustic and electric guitar, backed by drums and bass, with plenty of flute and some other interesting instrumentation.  The overall style is a mix of old and new Tull - not as sophisticated as the classic 70s, but more varied and complex than the basic rock style of most post-70s Tull.  The songwriting is definitely the most progressive rock/70s Tull we've heard from him since the old days, although it's also reminiscent of more recent Tull and Anderson solo albums - a nice mix.  None of the band (aside from Anderson) has recorded as Tull before, but the keyboardist and bassist (I believe) are in the current Tull touring lineup.  Guitarist Florian Ophale is a regular of Ian's recent solo tours, and a good Martin Barrish-style guitarist; although Barre is one of my favorite guitarists of all time, I can't complain about the guitar on this album.  Ian's voice has suffered over the years, but (maybe because I've grown used to his more recent studio singing) works quite well here - the only complaint I have is there's some excessive spoken introductions.<br />  Lyrically, the album follows the possible paths in life Gerald Bostock (fictional author of the original \\"Thick As A Brick\\" lyrics) might've followed in life.  The connection with Gerald Bostock seems irrelevant - it could be the paths in life of ANY person in modern England (or America), although this is nonetheless a worthy prog-rock concept album theme (in fact, Gentle Giant pretty had a very similar concept for their \\"Three Friends\\" which came out around the same time as the original\\"Brick\\").  Ian Anderson seems to have lost none of his cynicism and satirical leanings - the paths don't seem to be ideal (the religious man is a money-scamming evangelist, the shopkeeper has a somewhat shallow and monotonous life, etc.)<br />  I got the one-disc version - I didn't see the point of paying twice as much for bonus stuff I'd check out once or twice, and I much prefer a sturdy jewel case to a chincy digipak.  I was a little disappointed the lyrics weren't included - particularly since Ian's lyrics are actually worth reading!  (This seems a current trend in the music industry - odd, considering the lyric book would be an incentive to BUY the music rather than stealing mp3s off the web, like so many people do nowadays . . .).  I don't think the deluxe edition has lyrics in the book, either, though - I printed them out from the web, but I don't see why I'd have to do this when I bought the CD!<br />  Some of the music seems a little derivative from previous work (admittedly, sometimes it's deliberate references) but overall, this is a good, musically interesting and lyrically thoughtful work from Ian Anderson that is a worthy addition to a Tull fan's collection.

B003VS0CYC|5.0|Maybe I'm missing something but I found this Robocop Blu-ray collection looks and sounds very good compared to other similar movie transfers from the 80s. It's definitely 1080p and not some \\"upscaled DVD\\" transfer. I have the [[ASIN:B001AQO3QA Alien Anthology [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Skynet Edition) [Blu-ray]]] as well as [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]] and this Robocop set compares favorably to those transfers. Yes the first movie does have SOME grain...DUH...given that it was originally filmed on...gasp...FILM and not some digital HD rig! In fact the grain isn't even that big of a deal considering that some modern films have MORE ARTIFICIAL grain added than this movie. As for the sound the main track is encoded via lossless DTS-HD MA!<br /><br />For the price I paid..less than $6 per disc and free shipping I have no reason to even think about complaining. I'm so glad I didn't fall for the uninformed negative reviews and just went ahead and ordered this set. Given that I also own the Robocop DVD set...there's just NO WAY you could upscale those low resolution transfers and end up with the great quality on this Blu-ray set. To do a proper review you need to have seen or own the DVD set AND you need to own a native 1080p TV and have it receive 1080p output from a Blu-ray player. A computer with a Blu-ray drive connected to a native 1080p display is acceptable too.<br /><br />Oh and one final note, I think the people who said the video quality looks exactly like the DVD are either blind or they erroneously watched the first couple of minutes on the first film and thought that was the actual quality of the entire film...LOL! For those who do not know the first couple of minutes is supposed to look blurry and low quality due to the fact it's supposed to be footage of a \\"TV broadcast\\"...
0439023521|4.0|This book was a lot of fun. It was entertaining from start to finish.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I could not put this book down!!!! Super book! I plan on reading more of Blake Crouch's books!I loved the suspense and couldn't wait to find out what would happen next!
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Listen to this every day.  It is hard not to feel good about yourself and appreciate your world.  Highly recommended as a daily motivation tool.

B0087HT36U|4.0|Great Angry Birds type of game. fun and addictive. it needs more levels and more weapons but overall a great game
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book once and then went right back and read it again. I really like this book. It has taken me a long time to write a review for this book. Every time I sat down to write it I could not find the words to describe why I like this book so much. It is a hard story to read. Both the characters and the love story are deeply flawed!  I can honsetly say that at many points in the story I was angry with Abby and Travis.  I just wanted to smack some sense into them. This is not a fairy tale love story! It is hard and real love story! It is not flowers and sunshine. It is ugly at times.  But it is touching and true to both the Characters and the story!<br /><br /> It is a great story to read and reread. It make you believe in the power of Love and the strength it takes to make a true love work. I did not always agree with the decisions the characters make in this story. I did like how they had to work to make the relationship work and struggle to understand not only each other but their own personal demons. It shows that loving someone means loving the best and worst of the person.<br /><br />Great book!

B000N7KTBU|5.0|The build quality on this enclosure is among the best. The aluminum has the same finish as that on a MacBook Pro. It was easy to install the drive and it has been working great. This a very good product if you want something more than just a temporary place to use your hard drive.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very explicit verbage, but from the start this is a \\"can't put down\\" series! With each turned page there is an emotion you realize. You keep asking yourself, 'how would I feel,' and foremost,'what would I do'?.

There is one out there that didnt get much attention. He obviously didn't have the cash Moore had to promote this propaganda. Anyway he re buts every single point made in this horrendous doc.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|I decided to read the fifty shades of grey books to see what the big deal is and all three books are awful. The story line is weak and the characters are so unrealistic.There is no way I will read these books again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband and I love this app.  Been feeling sick and it help keep my mind occupied. Definetly a good way to kill time.
0525953728|5.0|This book was incredibly well written and the story itself totally amazing.<br /><br />I appreciate the author's candor and letting us here on the outside see a little of what happens on the inside. As a former helicopter pilot in the 160th, I can attest to the accuracy of the attitude displayed in the book and I can only hope that other readers take away the same heart felt appreciation for these brave men, as I did.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are many in the government that would have preferred that this book not be published, but the writer did tell a story that really should have been told with out jeopardizing our security.<br /><br />This a ten star book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book! Once you get to Chapter 4 it grabs your attention and don't let you go till the end of Book 3! Love it!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy and convenient to use big screen also like that it remembers what I do and makes totalling easy and convenient.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Having never read the book, the movie was completely new to me.Being an archer and hunter I found many interesting twists and turns that I would have never thought of. The clarity and color of the scenes were fantastic. Can't wait for the next film and no, I will not read the 2nd and 3rd books before I see them. The only reason that it did not receive a 5, is that some of the scenes were a little drawn out  and slowed down the flow.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am very attractive to this book not so much the writer. I am waiting for book too. If Sylvia Day still write like this book I will continue reading her books, but the last three books I was not impressed at all
B008M34INW|4.0|Gritty,action packed Mel Gibson vehicle!! Great cinematography of the sordid Mexican penal system.Young Mexican boy was unbelieveable in role of prison yard wiseguy!! I give Get The Gringo 4****s
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was very different from your standard King boogeyman book. There was the feeling of something hovering just out of sight that was threatening, but the story played out, beautifully, with only that feeling of threat, until it came to bear. King is still a master wordsmith, and he unravels the characters and the story masterfully. I loved this book, but there is so much I can't write into a review without spoiling it. Just understand -- there is no killer clown, no Randal Stark-- the villain is much more complex and more troubling in the end. I was enjoyed the hell out of this, in spite of it not being horror.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book series is great for older kids, ones who know all the bad words. The author uses thinly veiled bad words like : slithead, shuck, shuck face, now I know what they are really saying but I would not want my younger grands using those words. Our older children know better to use those words, so maybe thirteen and up depending on your rules.

B002FOAVGC|5.0|Most films that depict an apocalyptic future include elements that require much suspended disbelief; the realism of Children of Men makes the dystopia frighteningly immediate. The lengthy single-shot sequences put the viewer right in the middle of the action segments, especially the climactic battle/escape scene.

1250004217|5.0|July 1942, a very dark period in the history of France as thousands of Jewish families are rounded up and kept in Vel' d' Hiv'.  The families were locked up for days in appalling conditions with nothing to eat or drink in the stifeling heat and stench and then sent to Auschwitz in cattle trains that carried them to their deaths.<br /><br />These shameful events became a public secret in France because it was the French police who arrested the Jewish families, not the Nazis.  It was like a secret buried in the past.<br /><br />The author blends two emotional stories into this novel.  The story of Sarah, a Jewish girl and her family rounded up in 1942 and the story of Julia, an American, married to a Frenchman living in Paris 60 years after Vel' d' Hiv'.<br /><br />A heart wrenching novel about hatred and horror suffered by the Jewish people and how the surviving Jewish people's lives were forever tainted by this dark and evil event in history.<br /><br />An appalling read --- just achingly sad.  I highly recommend.
B0095R64AO|4.0|Trailers didn't give the film justice.  It almost kept me renting.  However, I am an Emily Blunt fan and took a leap of faith.  Glad I did.  A good laugh.

B004XISI4A|4.0|A rollicking good yarn and hard to put down, like the rest of the series. ifind the growing cast of characters hard to keep up with , especially on the iPad as its easier to look back when reading a book. Love the price of down loads though. Roll out the rest of the series George I'm hooked.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fantastic thriller, one of those that make the reader take a stroll around the block, with good turning points, well developed characters... I bought it out of curiosity after reading some reviews and I also recommend it!!!
0375842209|5.0|I decided to read this book after over 20 people told me it was in their top three books of all time. It is probably in mine as well. Heartbreaking, wonderful story that talks about love, sadness, hope, and depression for a German girl in World War II. This book will not disappoint.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  Totally engrossing and captivating.  I felt like I was there in person.  I have always appreciated our men & women in uniform but I have a new-found pride and patriotism for the job they do.  God Bless all of you who serve or have served.
B0087HT36U|2.0|This would be a solid 4, possibly 5 star rating,  but the game lags on my Thunderbolt so bad that some levels (like 2-28) are unplayable as it's impossible to get a shot off in time.
B0072OFM28|5.0|First of all I can say the new actor did a pretty good job as Spartacus, as far as his acting, but the absense of the original, Andy Whitfield, is definitley missed.  They share some similarity in appearance with the biggest discrepancy being their physique.  The new Spartacus is fairly small and weak looking, but he pulls off the character well pretty.  It's good to see most of the other main characters return.  Spartacus is still an awesome show with lots of action and drama.  Sometimes they go a little overboard with the blood.  For example, someone gets headbutted or a minor cut with a sword and a gallon of blood comes flying out.  I'd rather see it a little more realistic, but then again this is an over-the-top show.  If you liked the first season and the prequel, it's a no brainer you need to see this complete second season.  Now I have another long wait until the next season!

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book is pretty neat. Its so cool to read about Jaycee's life in captivity straight from her, all details. I've never heard of a victim writing their own book before, so I was very excited to read this. At first, I couldn't put the book down until about halfway through. After that, it wasn't such a page-turner. By all means, it was still good and interesting, it just wasn't as exciting. I just finished it, and was pleased. I liked hearing about her life after she was rescued, and about her therapy. I'm an animal lover as well, so I was able to relate to her on that aspect - not the kidnapped thing, but you know.

B0068MNO4S|4.0|First of all, both the cinematography and characterization in \\"Anonymous\\" are outstanding. The scenes of London, circa 1600--particularly those of the Globe Theater--are truly stunning. All of the cast are quite natural in their roles, and Redgrave, Armesto, and Spall give exquisite performances as, respectively, Elizabeth I, Ben Jonson, and Shakespeare. This is one of the few films I've seen where the great (alleged?) playwright himself plays a prominent role, and it's fascinating to see Shakespeare as he may very well have been. If you are interested enough to read a review of this film in the first place, watching \\"Anonymous\\" should prove to be a rewarding experience.<br /><br />With a very general knowledge of Shakespeare's life and his more famous plays (particularly \\"Hamlet\\") and some of the more famous historical characters--Ben Jonson, Christopher Marlowe, the Earl of Oxford, and a few others--I was able to get the basic gist of what was going on in \\"Anonymous\\" and appreciate its dramatic twists and surprises. Still, it helped to stop the film and consult Charles Boyce's excellent commentary-encyclopedia, \\"Shakespeare.\\" I might recommend reading up a little (a quick google should be sufficient) on the lives of Shakespeare himself, Elizabeth I, and perhaps most importantly, Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, before watching this.<br /><br />While it's important to remember that this is a work of fiction(and some of the details are certainly inaccurate), the basic story it presents seems plausible. One would have to be quite an expert on Elizabethan England in order to fully understand the complex political situations presented here. Nevertheless, all the details and intimations leave room for multiple viewings of \\"Anonymous,\\" noticing new things every time.
1451678193|3.0|The book does not read like a novel or a bunch of short stories. It is understood to be a classic, but I thought a classic holds up and this does not. There are solid worthy ideas in place, but I did not feel like an adult as I read it.  Might be great for high schoolers, who could find some new ways of looking at the world, but it was not great entertainment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Such an amazing book. Kept me in suspense the whole time. Will deffinately buy from this Author again. It should be a movie!!!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Finally the greatest movie made in the latter last century has made its most well deserved debut in BluRay, Bravo!,and well done!The clarity is superb the costumes and sceanery is clear as life so clear that a good eye may notice the computer animated people walking on the decks is not people,the only drawback to hd resolution its just to clear for its own good at times.Other than that the realistic clarity is a marvle to behold!I truly waited for the best of movie to become BlueRay and now my movie collection maybe complete for now.....?
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I was really excited to get this for my Kindle Fire, but it is a bit of a challenge to set up, and then it stops working sometimes.  It recognizes my computer only sometimes, and other times, won't link with it.  I am not sure what is happening, but I will keep trying.....

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a wonderful book - grabbed me from the very beginning and kept my attention until the very end.  A very insightful look at the lives of the house slaves on the southern plantations in the late 1700's.  The story is told from the point of view of Lavinia, a young, white indentured servant who is brought to the kitchen house by the master after her parents perished on a ship bringing them from Ireland to America.  Her color-blindness is an important part of the story, even as she moves up in white society as she comes of age.  It is an important story as it reminds us of the way all people are alike in their feelings and desires, and how easy it is to dismiss others whom we view as different from ourselves - a lesson still important to be reminded of in the 21st century.
B0085FS5XG|5.0|To all fans of the band(testament) their latest audio cd release titled(dark roots of the earth) is a must have. the music is powerful, Pulsating, And full of Testament energy. we dare you to take a listen to this testament audio cd. a thank you goes out to Amazon.com and all the employees at Amazon.com for delivering my audio CDs securely safely and on time. good day to all.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I love Lee Child and his Reacher books.  But the last two, this one especially, are just plain boring.  What happened to his intricate plotting? To the twists and turns and surprises?  None here.  The only faintly amusing point of the book is that David Baldacci tries to make fun of CHild in his latest book about a man called \\"Puller\\" which is a parody of \\"Reacher\\"  Now Lee child is naming an idiot cop \\"Puller\\".  Fun.  I hope Lee Child takes a vacation, stops writing for a while, and then writes a really fabulous Reacher novel. This isn't one.
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|this game was topology confusing. it made absolutely no since at all! and I love logical games. not worth the download

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading \\"The Hunger Games\\", I was hooked.  I raced through Book 2 (\\"Catching Fire\\") and was eager to read \\"Mockingjay\\"!  The book started out well, picking up where \\"Catching Fire\\" left off, with the same characters and some new ones.  Unfortunately, the characters get bogged-down in superfluous details of the rebel battles.  The ending and reunion of Katniss and Peeta  is abrupt and lacking in the descriptive prose of the first two books.  This final book left me longing for a re-write!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really a page turner. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read flynns other work. You should buy it too.

B0000399WI|5.0|There are hundreds of reviews about The Shawshank Redemption in general, and its place as one of the finest movies ever filmed. This review of The Shawshank Redemption is specifically about its context in the American Film Institute's Top 100 listing.<br /><br />The first release of the AFI Top 100 came out and while it covered movies through 1996 somehow it did NOT have The Shawshank Redemption on its list. This even though the list had a variety of other movies that even most casual film-watchers would consider far less worthy. I suppose one could launch a wide variety of conspiracy theories about why. Is it because there were practically no females in the entire movie? That in the entire, long 142 minutes of film lines I think we have 3 lines total by a female voice? That can't be true, because Patton was on the AFI list and I'm fairly sure it had NO female speaking role at all. Neither did Platoon, with the exception of a female villager who briefly spoke in Vietnamese.<br /><br />OK, is it the rough prison atmosphere in general? I'd be hard pressed to say that was true. After all, they included A Clockwork Orange which has some pretty foul rape scenes in it. Pulp Fiction had bondage and male-rape scenes. So it's probably not that.<br /><br />But in looking at the original AFI Top 100 listing, pretty much the *only* film which features a key black character is Guess Who's Coming to Dinner which squeaked in at spot #99. That was it. And the portrayal there was extremely banal. I do love the movie, don't get me wrong. But the character was as \\"squeaky clean\\" as they came. Heck, we had more Native Americans in the AFI Top 100 than we had blacks.<br /><br />So then fast forward ten years, with everyone screaming about some of the choices they'd made with this first listing. Off went Guess Who's. And on came In the Heat of the Night. On came Do the Right Thing which in its wildest dreams didn't have anything even remotely close on the first list. And on came The Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />Absolutely I feel The Shawshank Redemption *should* have been on the AFI list in the first place. And I'm pleased that it vaulted right into the #72 spot in the new revised listing. But it feels odd the way that it happened. I wish it had always been on the list, and that it hadn't seemingly been part of some of this on-and-off behavior.<br /><br />Still, with that all being said, clearly the movie is incredibly well done and well worth watching. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5shank Redemption.<br /><br />Absolutely I feel The Shawshank Redemption *should* have been on the AFI list in the first place.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Love this book!  Love the characters, the plot, the length, everything about this book is great.  I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN to the detriment of my sleep.  This is now one of my favorite books up there with LOTR, Harry Potter, and Game of thrones.  Seriously, this is a great book.
0385344333|3.0|See book summaries above.<br />Just a quick blurb. I have read all of Lee Child's thrillers and really liked them all. Jack Reacher a just a character I have really taken a liking to in the past few years.<br />While I still like the character, this latest in the series seemed rather lackluster. It really hooked me starting off then about a third way through i seemed to get a little bored with it. It just seemed to lumber on. This really took me by surprise, and caused some disappointment, because of what I'm used to with Child. Though it didn't have the vigor I'm used to, I still plan on reading on knowing it will get better.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I debated over this book for many days. Reading countless reviews trying to decide if I should purchase it it not. This is a great book, but I think it only appeals to the gaming generation. There are instances where the language got hard to decipher, but the way the author compiles the words together you quickly understand. I gave this a 5 star because I enjoyed the book from cover to cover. If you enjoy video games, using your brain, and turning a lot of pages this is a book for you. Enjoy =D

1594481938|5.0|I must begin: do NOT read this book if you are not interested in introspection (that was a double negative wasn't it), or if you like fairytales...<br /><br />Suicide told from the perspective of four unlikely characters.  The disgraced celebrity.  The rebellious 19 year old.  The lonely single mother.  The washed up musician.  Their lives intertwine in A Long Way Down, in Hornby's snarky, creative and ultimately soulful novel.<br /><br />Hornby writes from the first-person perspective of 4 characters.  By alternating between characters, the story is passed off from chapter to chapter like a baton.  In the process nothing gets glossed over, as much as nuisance and perspectives change as a different character takes the narrative further.<br /><br />All the characters are authentic.  In fact, Hornby has perfected a twenty-first century style of writing all his own of not becoming self indulgent and getting bogged in details, as so many writers do.  Hornby is keenly aware of his audience and shows the reader great respect moving on wear other authors would like to wax and digress.<br /><br />This is the rare book that is both very funny (out laugh out loud) and very sentimental.  It is after all about life and death and the banality of our existence.

B000OVLBHG|5.0|Starship Troopers is terrible! The dialog, the acting, loose plot. But I love it! Such a fun B-movie, and I've watched it a few dozen times. Fun Sci-Fi movie that you can get into. Plus it has Doogie Houser! But really, I love the idea of bug aliens, futuristic militaristic propaganda and intergalactic war as the ultimate combination. I love this movie even though I can find tons of things wrong with it.
0740748475|5.0|every single panel, ever. what is not to love? a must have for any Bill Watterson Junkie. You never know when you're gonna need a priority check in life.
1469984202|4.0|Of course, you have to suspend your sense of logic, and not probe too deeply into questions flitting about the edge of reality- Nonetheless, this series is a good read with some interesting characters. Surprisingly perhaps, the female characters in general exude more strength of character and are more appealing than the primary male characters, who tend to be relatively weak, borderline pathetic at times. The prequel 1st Shift was also worth reading- tho I would suggest reading Wool First. I look forward to reading further explorations of this world as they are published, while hoping there are fewer tears soaking the pages of future books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fantastic game! i play it at the higher levels and my 7 &4 yr olds play it at the lower level we really that it pushes the kids to think critically
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an 'impulse' buy for me; usually I stick with with my favorite authors.  That said, I was so glad I decided to give this author a try.  My one caveat?  At least for me, I really found it slow going through the first 50 or 60 pages and had to make myself 'stick with it.'. The further I got into this book, the harder it became to put it down.  I absolutely LOVED the ending, though I hated to see it end.  I'm anxious to try another one of her novels.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Battleship is a great action movie in the line of transformers and independence day. I enjoyed the plot and the highs and lows of events. The only odd thing about the movie was I thought it was too short? Especially for the price of admission/viewing. I will be watching the price of the blue ray to drop so I can fit this into my movie budget. Also, when Amazon has the movie watching on sale I will stream it again. I like action and adventure and this movie was great to me.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this and then had second thoughts about it afterwards. I wasn't sure if it was going to be worth it so I tried cancelling the order but it was already shipping on that day. I waited anxiously all week for my new toy and when it came in, I couldn't have been more elated. After posting a picture of me with my new gadget on Facebook, my friends are now calling me Mrs. Ponds. :P<br /><br />The UV light is fantastic and a nice little addition to the item. The pen works well but not in receipt papers. I bought this for two reasons: 1) I love Doctor Who and really wanted a Sonic Screwdriver and 2) I'm a cashier and needed a pen that no one would mistake for a pen that belonged at the store. It was the perfect excuse to spend $21 (the price wen up shortly afterward) on a new toy. So if you want to use the pen, it works well on everything except smooth, receipt paper so don't try signing any with it.<br /><br />My favorite part about the item is the sound effects. It's a great touch to the item overall. I actually didn't know about the sound effects until I opened the box and I was overjoyed. The box says that it has two different sound effects but it actually has two different buttons you can press for the same sound effect (unless I overlooked another button but I don't think I did because it's pretty easy to operate.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great product. I have no complaints, although I can't describe how ironic it was that I needed a real screwdriver to insert the batteries.<br />My only concern is when the ink will dry out, what do I do? I'm looking online for refills but I haven't found any so good luck to you all if you buy it and need a refill. If I find anything, I'll try to post it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Cool but some games are kinds weird. You should get the game if you are looking to be continuously distracted.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Absolutely love this app. So much fun and I have found it difficult to put my kindle down at all! But one must go to work.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Very entertaining.  Ranks way up there with the likes of Angry Birds!  Only crappy part was that I ran out of levels!  Make more!!
B0054SMID0|5.0|Haven't read the other reviews.  (Spoiler coming.) This entertaining little story commits political correctness as only Hollywood can, making the bad guy as lily white as they can, and it turns out he's a real son of a bitch.<br /><br />Tomei and McC---y were both good, though Tomei was nearly  a cameo, but not wasted either.  McC----y wasn't really \\"noir\\" enough to suit me, and this could probably be re-written in a darker style that would really work.  Nevertheless, I had a smile on my face at the end and didn't have that nagging \\"how could I have wasted a perfectly good 90 minutes on -that-??\\" feeling, because it was just good story telling.  Five stars, not for being world shaking, or brilliantly acted, but for being a nice little yarn.<br /><br />There was a half-twist at the end that didn't quite surprise, much less live up to the twisted ending I thought I saw coming, and the movie never really explained it.  You just don't care when you've been entertained.  Hollywood, for that matter, can't really tell a story that ties the loose ends together any more, if they ever could.  We don't really mind that much, do we?  After all, it's pop fiction.  What do we expect?  We expect entertainment.  Nothing less, but little more.  And this more than met that requirement.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|I thought this book was the most thought provoking I have read in a long time.  Challenging in both spiritual and<br />physical ways.  The way the tribe used to communicate, to follow the path, to learn to eat and bless what was provided.<br />The most interesting part to me was their healing methods.  When the man had the compound fracture and it healed in less<br />than a day was so amazing.  Just their willingness to honor one another and support each other was contrary to most of our<br />Western ways. I was grateful the author could share so many little details and be able to be absorbed into a totally different<br />community that took her completely out of her comfort zone was remarkable.  Probably even more so was her ability to have to<br />adapt to the western way of life when she left the tribe.
B0051BVQFG|1.0|Doesn't anyone in Hollywood have any imagination anymore. The same old lame special effects, the same tired characters, the same old explosions, the same old same old. I love a good Sci-Fi movie, or any type of good movie, but this stinker is one of the worst. Put it in the same category as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Super dumb !!!!!
B005KA188S|4.0|Movie is Awesome<br />Loved the Cast<br />It was nicely packaged and the movie has been played 5 times already<br />the only thing that bothered me was that it had no cover or paper cover insided Blu Ray but i had to go get one on my own<br />Great Price and good quality
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|My step-daughter and I love this game! Her only complaint is the tiles move down too quickly for her (age six) at level seven. But other than that, amazing spin on the falling blocks game!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is really fun! It combines a great game with critical thinking and my favorite show, how can I not love it?
B0060D0XE4|5.0|This is one of the better movies I've seen. It is very family oriented, and also a good fun time. I have probably watch this movie at least 50 times. It satisfies that inner hero within yourself.<br /><br />As it is a superhero movie, I do not wish to give away the plot. But it is sufficient to say that there is one and you will enjoy it. The acting is very good, and you will care about the characters by the end of this film.<br /><br />This movie is also very creative. They went to a lot of trouble creating a diverse set of characters as well as a cool villain.  They paid much attention to detail. Anybody that has ever read a comic book, or rooted for the underdog, will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Even though this is a children friendly movie, this movie also has enough for adults. It is witty, and well written. The characters of the parents feel just like regular parents.<br /><br />I can easily recommend this movie to all viewers.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I love the old language, and English usages.  It is such a classic piece of literature and one you can just read and enjoy.  The books run back to back and you can read one at a time or continue reading as much as you like.
B004T5R2HQ|2.0|I downloaded this app out of a last minute necessity and it seemed to do the job nicely.  Took a photo of a doc and turned it into a clean pdf, then sent it as email.  The next time I took a photo of another doc to do the same thing, it created a pdf which included the previous doc as well.  There doesn't seem to be a way to delete the gallery so it just keeps adding one doc to another.<br />The last time (following an update) I tried to photograph a doc, save as pdf and send, the pdf option disappeared.  I'm done.  Deleted it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is simple and fun i luv the bonus coins thre jinormis i luve the stuffed animals awsome!!!!!! toats fun
B001AIY58O|4.0|I found this movie to be halarious and a sad prophecy. As retired military and law enforcement I have experienced the growth of politicl correctness to a point almost as funny. Yes it is an action movie and all the hokey stuff that comes with. Two favorite lines , \\" We are police officers, We are not trained to deal with this level of violence.\\"  \\" an evil Mr. Rogers.\\" The real message is in the comedy.  This movie has been one of my favorites for along time.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I think this is just a hyped hunger games like the first book - most interesting parts only happen to the end - last parts seem most exciting out of the entire read but that i guess is too ensure one buys the 3rd book - nevertheless its a fun read but i in no rush to read the final book - enjoy the book
0802130208|5.0|the funniest book i have ever read.<br />once you meet igantius , you will never forget him and his adventures :)
0062206044|5.0|Three children, Violet, Klauss, and Sunny, become orphaned, after their parents perish in a terrible fire. See what kind of surprises await their new \\"father\\". Although there are a lot of unfortunate events that the three children endure throughout the story, see who is left with the misfortune in the end. It is a quick, witty, and entertaining read. However, don't expect a happy ending. :-).
B007SGM084|5.0|The story line was very good, you do not want to drop the book once you start reading. Erotic scenes were thought out and were essential to the story. Two thumbs up!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I haven't read the books,but my family recommended this based on the fiction series.It was entertaining. I hope they will do the other books as well.
B007P6VM04|5.0|This is a great soundtrack. Every song is outstanding. The Katherine Mcphee songs on this soundtrack are way superior than her own CD. please purchase this collection.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I read The Bourne Identity back when it was first published and I reread it every few years. Ludlum's plots are tightly woven and the characters are admirable but flawed. I really enjoyed it on my Kindle.  It is a favorite because of the suspense Ludlum builds.  It is a good thriller.  It is also a mystery and one of the few I could not figure out until the middle of the book.  Since I usually throw mysteries away in the first few chapters because I solved the mystery, this is high praise, indeed.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Very good movie. Worth watching. I watched on my computer and enjoyed it tremendously. Good action and the ending was great.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|The kids love this movie (actually, they love all of the Ice Age movies).  Hard to tell if they like the main characters or the crazy squirrel the best.  Either way, you can't go wrong with this flick.
B000002TQV|5.0|A truly awesome album.<br /><br />\\"Street Spirit\\" is probably one of the best songs ever!<br /><br />I was unimpressed with \\"OK Computer\\", but this is more approachable and, in my opinion, far better!
B007U4DIM6|5.0|sweet, charming, excellent family movie!!  didn't really see the first two, but it didn't make a difference.  this movie stands on it's own.

B003MC5N28|3.0|A watered down version of Huxley's Brave New World about a dystopian society. Written from a 12 year old perspective so young teenagers can relate to it. (Spoiler) I enjoyed the non-closure ending.
B00008PX8P|3.0|This stinks!  I bought this dvd 3 months ago for a party at a club so I had never used it.  We went to play it and get the message \\"NOT COMPATIBLE IN THIS REGION\\"  Why in the heck didn't this seller state this?!?!  This caused me embarassment and disappointment.  It's not really the product but the Seller.  I want a full refund including my shipping!<br /><br />**UPDATE - this company immediately refunded me the cost of the product and the full shipping amount. I would definitely do business with them again.  I change the rating to 4 stars since they were so prompt in their action but not 5 because it should have been stated that it only plays in certain regions.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|[[ASIN:B0087JTAKW The Time Keeper]]As always, the author captures an essence of mankind in a thoughtful, easy read. Albom's writings continually feed my thirst for insight and comfort, especially in this latest depression of the U.S.A.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I saw Hunger Games before I read any of the books. Was afraid I might be disappointed seeing it before I read the books, but I shouldn't have worried.  I loved all three of them.  Can't wait for the next movie
B0087HT36U|5.0|nice action. smooth play. addictive. better than angry birds imho.....challenges me to try unique approaches. five stars from me and i recommend it.  if i paid for apps, i would buy for a buck.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love it. More strategy than ABs. Many enjoyable hours spent playing the game. I'll go back through and work on high scores.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I love buying the series, for I can then just view each show and not have to wait a week. Soon to buy Season 4.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great App ! It is easy to use this calculator. I have used some apps that seemed to over complicate the basic calculator. This one is great.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was afraid that this series would be too juvenile for me and I couldn't have been more wrong. I couldn't put the books down and was disappointed at the end of the third book because there wasn't a fourth.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is a great read! From page one it draws the reader into the dangerous--but necessary--world of military special ops, climaxing with the raid on UBL's compound in Pakistan. In doing so, this book forces the reader to feel the fear, the excitement, the brotherhood and patriotism of the men and women of this \\"dirty business.\\" Despite what others have said, I can find no indication of secrets being revealed and jeopardizing the USA or any person. The authors went to great pains to be sure that didn't happen while still providing enough details to keep the pages of this book turning as fast as one can read them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is one of the best book I have read I can't wait for the movie but not sure if it can happen with all the sex scenes
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I thought the movie started off strong, it seemed to pull me in, and I thought it was extremely interesting watching the first part. A lot of people claim that this movie had stunning visuals, but I thought for a Science Fiction movie it had what it needed to. The one thing I would say was a little over the halfway mark I felt that the story got a little sloppy, and had a lot of elements that were typical in a lot of other films. This movie though had the potential to be a really great film, if they had focused more on the plot, and had the disease be the primary enemy. Like at the beginning of the film when the alien is exposed to the disease and dies instantly, why then when the human that is exposed to it in the film after he's burned alive come back to life? It's almost like two inconsistencies, and I just wanted them to have sticked to one, I thought it was lame that the one guy came back to life after being dead. I guess I was looking for more realism. Secondly, there's no life anywhere, so where do those eel things come from? I think they were looking for action when it wasn't necessary. It would have made sense if they came to that place and discovered it was an old military base where they engineered this disease or microb and it started killing them, but to have the eels and inconsistent deaths to me just ruined it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Literally every mystery story Arthur Conan Doyle's ever written. The best mystery stories ever! A classic, and only $1 for over a thousand pages, but is worth so much more. Buy this book!
B0088TG252|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Denzell is at his best. Ryan Reynolds is the up and comming actor to watch. The supporting cast was also good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run. It's a great game for all kids. Sometimes it is a little sensitive but otherwise a great game!
B004JKLBUU|4.0|Very disappointed that it was such a tiny book.  I had hoped to use it in my High School class I teach, when we have preschool.<br />Shipping was good.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|With the implied threat that this would be pulled before release, I was anxious to receive it, and glad when it showed up. Considering all the \\"important,confidential information that was supposed to be in it, the author said right up front he changed names, etc to protect national security. It was well written for an amateur, and gave some insight to the mind set of the team as they prepared for and executed their missions. I definitely recommend it as a must read. It was exciting and I was so proud of these young men who were able to finally put down Bin Laden.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first one was great, this one was great and so was the third! Reads very well on the kindel app.  I am looking forward to more books from E.L. James.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Powerful and intense description of the tactical work some of our most elite troops do. Timing of the mission, plan B if things go wrong, teamwork, training and so many factors to consider. They are our best for a reason and God bless each and every one of these souls.
B0086700CM|5.0|I own a Kindle Fire and i have no lag for this game. i have allmost completed the whole game too.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game but then again I don't like how long it takes to get the coins. Still love the game though :)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Deployers will like this.  I am glad the rumint was put to rest with this account.  Of course we were not there in person and even if I was my version would be different than the next guys.  This book gets you there as close as possible without the blood sweat and pain it takes to be in a position of actually participating.  This is an easy fun read.<br /><br />A few pokes at the President and VP late in the book but nothing worse that you hear every day.  My guess this attitude is prevalent in the military.  I hope they all get a fair chance to have their vote counted.<br /><br />It is a shame that he couldn't keep their names private, I have seen some exposed in other media.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|if your a serious Mario kart fan then this games is for you. honestly I just got the game and I already don't like it from playing 1 game. my tip to you is look at all the comment and listen to them they 're telling you the truth.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed this book as much as the first book of the Hunger Games series. It was hard to put down.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is the best batman yet in the three part series! I can't waite till this movie comes out on DVD and Blue-Ray!

B007BT0RKG|1.0|I tried searching for the name of Ponce, the second largest city in Puerto Rico. it told me I needed to buy the paid version, which I did. whereupon it returned everything EXCEPT the city of Ponce. Same results within Illinois. My complaint to Amazon has gone unanswered so at this point I'm out of luck and money.<br /><br />bottom line: don't buy this potentially great app yet!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It seems similar to Monopoly or Risk to me. It says it takes about an hour to play, which it does. Although the first time we played and tried figuring out the rules, it took us a couple of hours. Only up to 4 players can play, so I plan on purchasing the expansion to this game. It would be a lot of fun. This game is really fun, I would recommend it!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story is a small gem that I just happened upon... at first, I was disconcerted by the 2 story lines until I realized the earlier life was a part of Jamies` earlier life.... a truly engrossing picture of a different way of life.  I found myself laughing out loud at the restaurant scene.. the whole book played like a  movie in my head while reading it.... this book evoked lovely scenes and the dialogue and brogue made The Misremembered Man an unforgettable novel that I would recommend to everyone as a must-read.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|This is a man who had music secreting from his pours. This is a must see for any Bob Marley fan, or even a fan of the genre.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|While I'm disappointed that the two disc version wasn't released, I really enjoyed the Destroyer \\"Resurrected\\" experience. The new mix overall gives the album a fresh clean thumping sound... I probably would have left the echo on the snare drum in God Of Thunder and I still dont understand why the new version of Sweet Pain isn't the bonus track, instead of interrupting the original track sequence with a different solo... From what I've read online, the clitch at the beginning of Flaming Youth is Universal's problem and I look forward to them replacing my CD with one that doesn't skip (as it is very annoying).
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I don't see what all the hype about giving away secrets is all about as it would seem to me that all operations would be prepared for differently as the circumstances present themselves, nothing in here that is out of the ordinary.<br />As far as the read, it was very well done leading up to the mission itself.  Although the mission on the ground took about 40 minutes, the details and explanation of the operation itself seemed a bit anticlimatic.  In spite of this I would recommend reading this book.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this is an awesomes game I play it every day and all of the things in it are so cool it is definetly the best game on kindle fire ever
B0018QQQK8|4.0|The book was kind of slow at first but then got exciting. Very good love story. I can't wait to watch the movie.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|very addictive, but it had some problems loading one day and I had to turn of kindle and restart it to get it working again.<br />at first I didn't understand the point of it but after a few hours I couldn't put it down. be warned, it is the type of game that you need to play regularly (like farmville)
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|awesome awesum app! great way to while away the hours. also a good way to practice your math (for youngsters) and keep your mind sharp (for oldies).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book.  The storyline is very intriging.  The type of book you can put down.  I finished book one and had to start Book Two immediately.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|So fun with different jet packs.i play it when ever I have spare time. Love this game it is so awesome.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is a great cd.  I believe it showcases her incredible talent and range.  I would give this to any music enthusiast.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was a wonderful read. I enjoyed the character development throughout the trilogy. Ana and Grey are two very opposite individuals who work together in this love story. Thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can anyone say but, 'What a voice, what a talent, what raw emotions, and wow!'  Great cd and it did win the Grammy for both Album and Song of the Year.  That says anything.  I bought this for myself, and I love it.  Thanks!
B0086449YA|5.0|I can't say much more than has been said by the other thoughtful reviewers.  I just wanted to add my opinion that this is a fantastic effort.  This is the first of Mark's albums since \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\" that I could repeatedly listen to from beginning to end and never reach for the next button.  Most of his other records have a couple of great songs, several that can be appreciated by a Knopfler fan, and the rest, meh.  This is a great one.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I love Enya, and this albums is her best.  It has songs on that I didn't expect like silent night in gaelic.  Just beautiful and peaceful music to listen to in a much too rushed and busy world.  Thanks for the break away from the hectic world.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|I think some people who are true sci-fi fans and either didn't like this movie initially or were confused on how to feel about it should watch it again.<br /><br />I watched this the first nite it came out in theatres and everyone was super quiet after the movie ended. I think everyone was processing...This movie doesn't use the typical sci fi tactics to engage the audience... there isn't really a constant feed of mind-numbing visual action one would assume. This movie was done tastefully (for the most part) and speaking of good taste...wow, there is a really freaking hot guy in this. Logan Marshall-Green is so friggin' hawwwwwwt he made me smile just watching him. But prepare thyself because there is a price to pay for those good looks of his. I will not spoil anything but if you're squirmish, get ready!. .<br /><br />Initially it was hard for me to accept Noomi as the female protagonist for a few reasons. I'll just come out and say it: there is something off-putting about her facial structure and hair for me. Her bone structure is maybe just bad on film. I wanted to slick her hair back the whole movie because it was always in her face. Not to mention her accent in this. In the end, she won me over with her perseverance for answers despite the obstacles and her ability to survive. I can't say I'm sold on the idea that she would have pushed through all she did due to how her character was presented, but I accepted it and kept my eye on the idea her character brought up which is you may not like what answers you find that reside beyond your faith but the truth is freeing. She really is a pretty good actress so eventually my shallow reasons for not liking her fell by the wayside.<br /><br />I love the guy who plays the captain of the Prometheus- Idris Elba. He has a few cheesy lines, but I think he was good for the role. And ya gotta have the black guy! Charlize Theron is, as usual, wonderful to watch. Fassbender was pretty good but I never got why he was such a vindictive android plus I had just recently seen him in Shame and the transition from a sex crazed sad guy to android was a little (*cough*) hard to shake. Guy Pearce was okay at best being a gross old rich man; I wish they would have just used an old man though. Older actors need roles and this would have fit the bill for the right old man. And I REALLY wish they would have better visualized the ship itself since the movie was even named after it. I never got a good sense of the layout. One of the things I didn't like about this movie.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! The aliens in the movie are well done. I got so frustrated when the alien doesn't answer Dr. Shaw in some way after she pleads for answers and pours her heart out. In his facial expression, the alien seems moved by her briefly, but then the android steps in and just pisses him off. You'd think Mr. Weyland would have a better plan for first contact than to use an android as ambassador asking for sh1t. That is not how you get what you want. No less from an HR Giger represented alien species.<br /><br />Despite the stereotypical plot twists and tactics, I really enjoyed this film. I wish there were more sci-fi movies in general and I've always been a fan of Aliens (and I'm not too big on scary stuffz). Don't expect perfection from it, despite my 5 star rating. Compared to all the thoughtless garbage Hollywood makes these days, this is a gem... You might just need to give it a second (or third) chance to let it charm you.ctive android plus I had just recently seen him in Shame and the transition from a sex crazed sad guy to android was a little (*cough*) hard to shake.

No less from an HR Giger represented alien species.<br /><br />Despite the stereotypical plot twists and tactics, I really enjoyed this film. I wish there were more sci-fi movies in general and I've always been a fan of Aliens (and I'm not too big on scary stuffz). Don't expect perfection from it, despite my 5 star rating. Compared to all the thoughtless garbage Hollywood makes these days, this is a gem... You might just need to give it a second (or third) chance to let it charm you.

B007UPNA6Y|4.0|From Lee Child, the Wanted Man, is about as predictable, formulaic and highly readable as all in his successful series.  Like the others, the Wanted Man includes all that a reader could wish for:<br />the huge, intellectual, observant, mathematical, lover of skill, Jack Reacher performs one clean out of bad guys while vastly outnumbered, one great bedroom scene, a resolution that keeps police and governments clean but is of course, arbitrary justice and vigilante behaviour on his part.  Jack Reacher is as the blurb says the man men would like to be, and the man women would like to be with.  Sigh, formulaic, repetitive, but whens the next one coming out!

B003UAKE9Y|5.0|When was the last time you had a good scare?  Coraline is an interesting stop motion animation feature that came out in 2009.<br />It is based off the book of the same name that came out in 2002.  It is very well done and guaranteed to work your imagination.<br />Coraline is essentially a movie about a little girl with an adventurous young spirit.<br />She moves to a new apartment building with her parents and is destined to find an adventure.<br />During her adventure she meets the neighborhoods and makes friends with fellow tenants.<br />She eventually finds a secret door that leads to an alternative universe.<br />At first glace everything in the other universe is wonderful and ideal.<br />Her alternative world parents spoil her and everything is fun and games.<br />Before long she realizes that this vision of reality is actually fueled by an evil force.<br />Throughout the movie Coraline interacts with many different interesting characters in a battle to overcome<br />the monsters on the other side of reality.<br />Coraline is actually a horror movie that is also a children's film.<br />The images and scenes are fantastic and really capable of causing a stir in a person of any age.<br />Caroline is imaginative, entertaining, and creative film.
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|Why should you watch HAYWIRE then? Because it's a film by Stephen Soderbergh, a filmmaker so utterly devoted to his craft, he's threatened to retire from it (yeah, one of \\"those\\" auteurs). Sarcasm aside, Soderbergh knows what he wants, and he almost always delivers. HAYWIRE isn't intended to be anything original; and it's not. It's a straight-up action film, full of those twists and fight scenes and menacing baddies that all action films feature, but filtered through Soderbergh's well-honed lens. The cinematography is perfect; the fight-scenes are flawlessly choreographed, with no weird cuts or music to take away from the brutal punches and shattering glass. These are real people doing real stunts. Yep, just like it used to be.<br />Simply Sublime.

B0014EVO4M|4.0|As a fan of Pearl Jam for many years, I'm biased toward this album to begin with. I read the book before I saw the movie. Both were inspiring, but what really made the mood of the movie come through for me were Vedder's songs. Soulful and echoing the loneliness of someone who's chosen a path apart from society, every one of the songs on this album are amazing and stirring to my spirit.<br />The only reason I gave this album 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is so short. The problem with good music is that it seems to go by so quickly, and when the album is only 30 minutes long, it goes by even faster. At just 33 minutes, it falls about 15 to 20 minutes short of what I would expect from a full length album.

B0088RQ4TI|4.0|The kids love this movie. They have watched it 2 times so far, and have wanted to watch it more. They love the story line, and effects of John Carter. It kind of reminded me of a Star Wars meets Indiana Jones, with a little bit of Avatar. Great movie!!

B0042JIL2E|5.0|IMELDA MAY-MAYHEM: Retro rockin' roadhouse raver? Whopper-bopper show stopper? Swingin' sex kitten with a whip? Red hot Irish soul-mama IMELDA MAY fits all these descriptions and so many more on MAYHEM, a sultry, sleazy, slam-bang affair immersed in heavy doses of jumpin' jive, rowdy rockabilly, and cool country groove-ology. Fueled by MAY's ultra-expressive pipes and vivacious vitality, searing rave-ups such as PULLING THE RUG, JOHHNY GOT A BOOM-BOOM, and PSYCHO pulsate with twangy echo, surf guitar funk, playful RNB and everything else in the kitchen sink. Lower key excursions KENTISH TOWN WALTZ and TOO SAD TO CRY are very neccessary \\"smoke breaks\\" during an otherwise non-stop party, while a just-for-fun cover of TAINTED LOVE almost erases SOFT CELL's synth-wave smash from the memory banks. This sizzlin' platter should effortlessly hook fans of BRIAN SETZER, WANDA JACKSON and PEGGY LEE alike, a diverse rafter-raiser that demands repeated spins no matter what mood you're in. IMELDA MAY is probably far too talented to ever achieve mainstream status...but there's nothin' wrong with spreadin' around her dirty little secret.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE YELPS

B0085KGHI6|5.0|Well I had to settle for the comfort of my man cave and my flat screen Panasonic lol, when watching this live concert at Buddy Guy's Checkerboard Club in Chicago.<br /><br />Everybody was crammed into the club like sardines in a can. Muddy Waters was up front and center perched on his chair belting out the blues with his band when in walks The Stones in town to perform their own gig. The boys saunter into the club, pull up a few chairs and settle in while Waters is warming up the crowd.<br /><br />The Stones idolized Muddy Waters back in the 1960's when Muddy was touring spreading the blues gospel to the rest of the world. The connection was made back then between the blues and rock and roll as we have it today. The blues seed was planted and the Stones nurtured this style of music into their own style of music.<br /><br />It doesn't take long before Muddy is coaxing Mick up to the stage to join in and next thing you know he has them all up jammin' as if their lives depended on it.<br /><br />Other Blues Greats make their own way to the stage cramming it to over capacity to the delight of all those lucky dogs who were present. Lefty Dizz, Buddy Guy, and  Junior Wells to name a few.<br /><br />It seemed like everybody in the house was on something that night, a high octane groove was in the air and the banter and swagger back and forth between the performers was electrifying.<br /><br />It was a hoot watching Mick strutting his stuff, wagging his caboose and howling to match one of his peers. His  band mates coolly just played off to the side, chain smoking and rising forth when prompted to do so.<br /><br />A few drinks later, a few fine performances past, the whole joint breaks loose. Lightening rarely strikes the same spot twice. Wish I could have been there to see history in the making.

B001S49AQW|3.0|I love Georgette Heyer so much. I've read over 10 of her books but Friday's Child left me so disappointed. I felt I never really understood what each character was feeling. The ending does wrap up the story and was pleasant, but I felt disconnected from the story the entire read. :(

B008FDOS66|5.0|I am a Skynard fan going back to the 70's. I still have an unopened Street Survivors album. To me, I was always a little scheptical about any new releases beyond the original Skynard. Over the years I have enjoyed the \\"New\\" releases a little more as the modern band matured. The God And Guns album is a great collection of songs which are well written and relate to our currant times. The Last Of A Dying breed is one of the best written releases to date. Ready To Fly is about family, getting older, what all of us will go through in time, excellant song. Good Teacher, from learning about love, to life, to school, great song. Start Livin' life Again, About the excesses in life. All the songs are well written, well played. I know that there is only one original member left, but you have to check this out. Give a listen, than listen again and again. I believe you will pick your favorites. Out of 11 songs, 9 are excellant, two are great. With the quality of song writing, the excellant ability of these musicians, I hope the title does'nt mean it's their last.
B006XOBFJC|5.0|Wow-this is really excellent, and an amazing bargain. Not previously being a huge Wagner/Ring fan, I am now playing this for the second time all the way through. My only slight quibble is that the sound is just a bit compressed, and may lack a little sparkle, but thankfully and more importantly doesn't exhibit any CD glare. As another reviewer states, this is an extremely (taut) and dramatic version of the Ring, emphasizing rapid tempos and with terrific voices and ensemble throughout. I really love this-can I be saying this about the Ring?
B00881VLCE|3.0|I almost rated this higher until I realized a few things.  The puzzles aren't updated as frequently as the ipad  version, the rotate function doesn't work very well and most importantly, all of the puzzles are exactly the same regardless of the pic!
B00943SQCI|4.0|Don't know how I missed this movie when it came out in theatres but it is very well done.  This is the perfect role for Johnny Depp.  If you liked Sleepy Hollow you will love this.  Very entertaining and the styles and music from the 70's add to the fun.  Admit I have never watched the original series so cannot comment on that aspect but will definitely check them out now.

B000N6UERK|5.0|i've always really liked this film and i had a dvd version which looked great with my blu-ray played upgrading the clarity. so, when tony scott, the director killed himself recently, there was mention of many of his films including this one. so, i bought the blu-ray version mostly to honor his career. i knew this film quite well and i was always impressed at its quality on dvd, so i really didn't expect much from the blu-ray version. well, i wrong. the blu-ray is really stunning and the sound which is crucial at certain points in the film especially at the beginning is equally stunning. i think i bought a used version but i never noticed any loss of quality. this is an interesting story with a completely implausible premise, but the actors from top to bottom create such a realistic atmosphere that the suspension of disbelief is quite easy, i think. the script is quite clever and the implications of their interference in trying to play god with time has powerful consequences. and there is a powerful laura-like romance where the investigator falls in love with a person believed to be dead. in \\"laura\\" it was a mistaken identity problem, but here it is more troubling, but highly charged. i am really happy with this upgrade to blu-ray.

It was difficult when I got injured.  It's funny because no one tells you that you need to learn to run.  Everyone thinks running is innate.  It is not.  There is so much technique involved.  Finally, a system to learn how to run!!!!  It works!!!  There's more to it than you think.  It's easy to understand and learn.  Feeling pain free for the first time in years.  Stop working too hard and learn ChiRunning.
044024630X|4.0|This was the first book I have read by this author. The character, Jack Reacher, has quite a few favorable qualitys to me. He stands up for whats right not fashionable or CYA. He has human weaknesses that make him more human, no superman, but an abundent amount of common sense. I reall prefer authors that make the hero an everyman so the reader can relate to them. He has that likeable quality while still getting the job done, no fluff just end results. Rules are broken and the guilty pay for there sins, the way the world should but does not work, many times. I recommend this book, it moves at a good pace, just fast enough to keep you wanting to read more. Will be buying more Lee Cchild books in the future.

I keep hearing our DOD and WH saying about classified info involved - I bet it is clean.....not like the info that The Anointed One espouses.

Strongly recommend reading this book.

B008BM9L72|4.0|Book one sets the scene, books 2 and 3 weave the story.  An interesting story. Book one woud be shallow without reading the other 2 books.  The characters were developed into strong personalities.  A great trilogy to escape into.
1582406723|4.0|The Walking Dead is the story of the zombie apocalypse and the survivors who fight to stay alive. They band together and work to find food, shelter, and safety in a world overrun by dead people who feast on the flesh of the living. The social effects of such a cataclysmic event are on full display here which is what makes it so new and entertaining.<br /><br />It is not as exciting, as frightening, or as real as the television show is, but I chalk that up to it being so short. The idea is spot-on, to show the human struggle against the zombies, not to glorify the zombies themselves. The introduction clearly explains the author's motive and I believe he succeeds. This book covers what season one of the show covers. It leaves some things out and it is minus some of the characters in the show, but fans of the show will enjoy reading this and seeing how things were manipulated or embellished for the small screen.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Intriguing book. I picked it up through my library since I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the $12 Amazon wanted. Elements of the writing were excellent. The POV kept changing from the Protagonist, to the wife's diary, and then to the wife, all throughout the novel. This kept the plot moving in ways I wasn't expecting, which helped to hold my interest. The middle of the novel got a little dull, since you're waiting to see if the Protagonist can figure out what's really going on. That being said, I wanted to see how it ended.  Without spoiling it, lets just say the ending kept me wondering, \\"WTF?!\\" I'm glad I read it. It was definitely something different and it would have been a great book for a discussion group, but the ending felt really flat and abrupt. I was happy to return it to the library.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The Walking Dead is about the zombie apocalypse, which has been done many times before. I am not a fan of the countless zombie movies that are made year after year, but this show is a revelation. While it has its share of blood, guts and gore, the main theme of the show is survival in a world that bears no resemblance to the one before. A group of varied people work together to survive against a common enemy and discover that survival of the fittest is a fact.<br /><br />Rick Grimes wakes up from a coma after being shot in the line of duty to discover that there is no one alive in the hospital besides himself. There are bodies in the hallway and a room marked \\"dead inside\\" in blood. He finds a dismembered body on the side of the road, bones sticking out, a gruesome sight, but it is moving and trying to come for him. When he realizes what has happened and what he is facing, his only hope is survival, and his mission is to find his wife and son.<br /><br />This short six episode season is a teaser for what is to come, an exciting and disturbing show that strips human nature down to its barest instincts.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This is the fourth book in this series that I have thoroughly enjoyed.  I especially like the fact that Philippa Gregory uses no unclean language and no filth in her books.  It is a welcome change to some of the authors who are writing in this day and time and seem to think that the more profanity and vulgarity they use, the better.  I look forward to future books by this author.

1594481938|5.0|I am now listening to Long Way Down for the third time and it makes me laugh just as much as it did the first time.  The audio recording is probably the best way to experience this novel because there are four great actors who perform the roles of Jess, Martin, Maureen and J.J.  I listened to the book twice in a row more than a year ago and just pulled it out again after hearing Scott Brick (J.J.) read another audio book.  The humor here is dry and understated but the dialogue and inner musings of these four characters are among the funniest I have read (listened to) ever (and I listen to hundreds of books a year on a very long commute).<br /><br />The concept of the book is brilliant -- a traffic jam on the top of a well known suicide building on New Year's Eve, with four very different and quirky people.  Notwithstanding each of their surface quirks, there is much insight to be had in this novel and from these characters.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very addicting and fun app!  The only problem I have had is I have trouble opening it on occasion but once I force close and reopen, it works fine.
B007U4DB4G|5.0|This is for sure a Disney classic, because this movie has everything a great disney classic needs, great characters, great/funny/sarcastic  villians, and a great catchy song sung by rainia Rodriguez.

0811870413|5.0|I have been baking my own bread for close to 10 years now. I thought I had the holy grail with the no knead recipe from Mark Bittman. However, I purchased this book and it lay in my pantry for about 2 years, and the first time I spent the effort to make the basic country bread from the book, I knew I really had found the holy grail! OMG...beautiful crunchy chewy crust, holey, complex inside with beautiful crumb and texture unlike anything I have ever made. To be honest, it is the best bread I Have ever tasted in my whole life. We live only 1 hour from San Francisco, and have eaten authentic sourdough bread my whole life. This is better, in my opinion.<br />I did not make his leaven from scratch, I had some 100 yr. SF sourdough starter, that I used to set up the leaven. It works beautifully. I make my bread with 30% whole wheat, and it is as light as any all white bread. I recommend this book for any baker. I follow the directions to a T, and get pretty consistent results!

B003GSLX5Y|3.0|My original paperback copy of this book was in tatters. As the author of \\"Write with Passion...Sell with Power\\", I found it very useful.The ideas and the rules to follow are essential in clearing out the mess that first appear in your draft. With my paperback in hand,I was able to reference and make the corrections on the fly.Now that my original is in tatters,I thought I would purchase this for my kindle as a permanent reference. While this kindle version is not as comprehensive or as complete as the paperback....it does the job.Using the kindle version makes writing easier with the ability to highlight (kindle touch) passages and rules quickly. The book is essential for any serious writer. If you can find the original...all the better. Which begs the question...why isn't the full blown version of this formatted for the kindle?

You have various styles from so many genres and MORE importantly you have Billy operating at a lyrical apex, along with Adore, that he will never match again if what his newer works concede is true. Pick this up and fall in love with this beautifully remastered set.<br /><br />I do have one note and that is the deluxe remastered version. ABSURD pricing. My lord. 90-125 bucks? There aren't even DVDAs in the package. King Crimson gave us DVDAs with tons of extra stuff AND the past remasters plus a CD version for 20 bucks! This kind of pricing is beyond insane.<br /><br />I do like many of the throwaways, remixes, acoustic pieces, etc. But it's nothing I can't live without. I have them in 24/96 digital from captain hook himself, but I felt obligated to get this box because the packaging is very pretty and the extras are decent if a bit useless. I do like the nice paper quality of the large lyrics booklet.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Too much ego, causes doubt as to the validity of the content.  Account creates more questions than answers.  Would not recommend for reading.
B00066N8JS|5.0|Not much needs to be said here. This album stands the test of time like few others do. The lyrics are some of Reznor's best and most personal and they will never be replicated again in this context. There isn't much else to say that hasn't been said before. It's basically a perfect album from start to finish. Harsh, quiet, reflective, abrasive, dejected, and filled with emotion. A powerful statement of the times and to this day still remains relevant in all aspects. An utter masterpiece of musical perception.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|No words to describe how this book made me feel! Mitch is a terrific writer, all his books are full of hope, faith, & wisdom. Keep 'em coming!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am a korean vet and for a short while was stationed at Little Creek Va. wear the UDT trained. (forerunner to the SEALS). This book describes exactly how the SEALS trained and the accounts of their missions are really great. This book deserves the five star rating.
B00846REIS|4.0|Bared to You was an exciting book to read but too close to Fifty Shades. I did enjoy the characters and will probably read the next book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It makes you appreciate that much more what our soldiers go through each and every day to protect this country!
B008OHV5HS|5.0|Damian Wilson is back with his beautiful voice, the music is still the same, full of great melodies, songs with a lot of catchy chorus. The guitar of Karl Groom is always shinning with some exquisite solos, the rhythm section is solid and the keyboards of Richard West are efficient as background. The combination of all these elements have created a texture that make the music of Threshold something very consistent. The quality of the compositions is in their ability to unite the metal with the neo-prog approach without falling in too much complexity and technicality.<br /><br />After listening many times to this release, i get the feeling that there is something more in this one than the previous one. They have surpassed themselves with some stronger parts that seems new to me, despite the fact that their style doesn't allow for a lot of diversity. Maybe the comeback of Damian Wilson  is the beginning of a new chapter for the band in their quest to be one of the leader in the progressive metal genre.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very engaging game which offers so many puzzles. I used this on a flight and couldn't stop! I never intended for that, but I kept being impressed by this game even though I'm not a very big puzzle person.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day was a hard to put down book. I have read many books on combat special groups and this ranks tops.I felt like I was there.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I was blown away by these headphones!! Some of the best around-ear headphones Ive purchased (and Ive purchased A LOT.)<br /><br />Pros<br />-High range of sound (you'll definitely hear those highs and lows)<br />-This will rival some of the 10-20 dollar headphone Sony is producing.(In terms of sound, not build quality)<br />-Good level of noise cancellation.<br />-Thick and durable cable. Good length.<br />-Very comfortable, i can wear these all day!<br /><br />Con<br />-The treble is not the best.<br />-Flimsy materials (expected at this price range).<br />-Due to its design, some noise leakage will occur depending on your head size.
B0024CEY36|4.0|While not at the level of Pillars of the Earth, this historical novel did not disappoint.  The Man from St.Petersburg would be especially interesting to readers with adult children as the characters are dealing with the generation gap. It was interesting to see a mother trying to protect an adult child from strong emotions where the mother has her own passion return.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Intuitive and fun to play!  Treasures of Montezuma 3 has great graphics and superb sounds. Will there be a Treasures of Montezuma 4?
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Very challenging game, each puzzle gets harder and harder with more spiders. Very hard to put down, I can play for hours. Great entertainment.

B008XG1X18|4.0|absolutely love the pinterest app. some nice features. love the home page and the swipe left to right. easy to repin and browse. sometimes it doesn't open correctly but honestly not that big of a deal to me. love it for the kindle fire!

B008XG1X18|5.0|There are so many great ideas cooking, cleaning, crafts, etc. I love looking up new recipes to try, and crafts for the kids.
B005RKBZEI|5.0|I've been buying Darren Hayes music for years and years, ever since he was a member of Savage Garden. I have his first two solo albums but hadn't kept up with his music for a while. I bought this with an Amazon promo and I'm glad I did. It's the perfect mix of upbeat and soulful music. I already have my favorite tracks, and listen to them on repeat often.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|Another excellent Baldacci thriller. This one introduces a new hero, Will Robie, and a great mystery scenario too.<br />Robie is a covert operative who finds himself in a situation where no one can be trusted, and every person could be his killer. Complicating this is Robie's decision to save a young runaway from the man who may have killed her parents.<br />Well worth reading.
0307887448|5.0|If you're from the 80s (like I am) and you're a gamer geek (like I am) or if you like the 80s (like you all should because it was awesome) you're going to love this book.  I read about 75+ books a year (see geek comment) and this is by far the best book I've read in a couple of years.  It's a real page turner with an excellent method of story telling.  I'd highly recommend it!!
B0017I1IZA|4.0|I have become a rabid fan of her works.  This series is enjoyable, easy read on an airplane or late nights when sleep evades me.  I have read the entire series this month and am anxious to read the upcoming #19 due out in November of this year.  When I read it, I see actors......
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This is the best of the three. I Could not put it down. But if you haven't read any of them yet, you must start at the beginning with the dragon tattoo.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I earlier gave this book a one star review saying that the price of $20 missed the sweet spot for pricing.  My review was removed by Amazon.  What's the real rating of this book?
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|This series just pulls you in.  Kind of like Sopprano's from a long time ago.  I would make this part of your Blu-ray collection!
B005G5PPGS|5.0|One of the most addicting books I‘ve ever read.  If you like reason and statistical analysis you will love it.
B00845PV16|2.0|Bad acting, did not follow the the story line of the first Gost Rider. The first Gost rider beat the devil and at the end he was to continue fighting the devil and help man kind. In this movie the Gost Rider just stood around flexing and growling. Instead of meeting evil head on.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is cool. cooler then virtual city paradise<br /> I just love. this game. but dang how was the game made 1654?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Every time I knew where the story line was going, another twist.  really enjoyed  the book.  looking forward to another by Gillian Flynn
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Enjoyed these quick stories.  Connelly always has a great imagination.  The price was right for good entertainment.  I would recommend this book for your enjoyment.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|So far so good! I really like. This is the best game I've ever played. This is a must have game.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I have to admit I hadn't heard much about this movie, but enjoyed it thoroughly. While predictable, the story is a good one with a positive message.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read Hunger Games trilogy and enjoyed all 3 books. Easy reading and all 3 page turners. If I could add a little critique it would be that in some cases I would have liked more information. For example, the entire story is a post-apocolypse period and takes place in what we call, North America. This new society possessed many of the technologies that we enjoy today, there was no explanantion how they maintained to acquire these technologies. There was also no mention of any other continents, if people survived elsewhere or if there was any travel to other parts of the world, with the exception on the districts within the North American continent. I did give it 5 stars purely for the entertainment value.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Even when many reviwers say this wasn't necessary or that they don't notice a sustancial change in the sound of this record, I think Ezrin and team did a great job. Some tapes were lost through time, so they worked with a variety of mixes and single tracks, and the result is great and very noticeable if you have a decent audio equipment (if you don't, but you know the original recording perfectly well you will find it very interesting anyway). Tha main improvement is in sound. It's not a remaking of the record. Have that in mind if you are going to buy it.<br /><br />The disc (not the package, right?) is a very nice replica of the original LP, you'll see. And the booklet liner notes are by Bob Ezrin, who gives you technical details many times missing in this sort of re-releasings.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|I was looking for a math app and this one came up for free. I am really enjoying playing it. it is just like tetrus. ( I am sure that I have misspelled that) it was well worth it.

B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I have read and enjoyed all \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels. However his latest is complicated and almost unreadable.  Lee - get back to basics.
B005IS565S|3.0|This my first experience with FFDP and this CD certainly does rock. Nice, heavy in-your-face guitars, a lot of double bass drumming and a singer with a strong voice and the ability to scream with the best of them. American Capitalist is good for about 40 minutes of straight head banging. Even the slower songs have their powerful moments, no all-out power ballads here.<br /><br />There are downsides. By the time you're finished all the songs end up sounding the same. The lyrics are bad and every song is about the same subject: I won't back down, you can't defeat me, I hate you, I hate myself, screw you, leave me alone, I'm a man. There's enough testosterone in these songs to choke a bull. The music gets you charged up while the lyrics become silly as the CD goes on.<br /><br />I listen to this at work when I need a shot of adrenalin to make it through the day. Just don't pay too much attention to the lyrics.
B007SGM084|4.0|The sex is hot. It does get a little repetitive. Loved the first 2. The third is super slow in the beginning but I had to finish. The end is good. And the last two chapters from Grey's perspective was really good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you have a hard time reading the bible this is a great product.  Not only is the bible easier to read but certain translations have audio therefore you can hear the bible as it is being read to you.  This really helps me to read certain passages of the bible and there are numerous translations to pick from.  Overall I am glad I picked this product.

B0091THRCU|5.0|Like my title says the engineering that went into this thing is very precise. It really fits perfectly. Don't be in doubt thinking the phone will stick out a bit, it does not it sits flush once it is pushed down into the case, I was worried about that looking at snugg's website and the picture they show. There is a leather strap that is magnatized to stay on the side of the pouch used for helping you get the phone out, because after all it does fit in rather snugg ;). I just think this addition puts this pouch/case above the competition. The craftmanship of the case and the materials, while not real leather, are of amazing quality. The stitching is strong, the inside is lined correctly it is just really put together nicely. I don't dout a couple years from now I'll still be using this pouch. As I love my phone staying \\"naked\\" but don't wish to actually use a big/obtrusive case, but while having protection from keys etc. in the pocket. Snugg has a lifetime warranty registration on their website which just puts the icing on the cake. If your a pouch kinda person this is the pouch for you honestly look no further.

1858111773|5.0|An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This excellent work is a little dated today but it remains of historic importance to students and lawyers because of the fundamental problems concerning enforcement are still with us. In the post-O'Brien era, lawyers continue to remain alert to the tactics of the defence and need access to a range of counter-strategies which Marc Beaumont offers.<br /><br />Those acting for banks and other financial institutions in mortgage litigation will find a ready and reliable companion in this work whilst recent problems with the so-called \\"credit crunch\\" have highlighted and exacerbated some of the problems.<br /><br />Beaumont covers the following areas which tend to arise most frequently in the course of a mortgagee's possession action: defeating existing Barclays Bank v O'Brien defences; defeating relevant claims linked to O'Brien defences; defeating forgery defences notwithstanding new legislation since the book was published; defeating overriding interests (a popular examination question for students!); defeating defences under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which are still in force and coming before the courts; and essential guidance on practice and procedure.<br /><br />The work also includes example expert reports in forgery and extortionate credit bargain cases which may still remain relevant today although the issues are of historic importance and academic relevance for undergraduates.<br /><br />\\"Effective Mortgage Enforcement\\" remains an important work for solicitors in practice seeking a first point of reference or a quick revision of the relevant law as it was a couple of years ago although practitioners will need to cross-refer to recent developments.<br /><br />The book is not too simple for the practitioner who is seeking to carry out rapid but valuable research and it can be used in conjunction today with more recent publications from the Law Society and the Legal Action Group.<br /><br />Counsel will find the emphasis on recent and unreported case law in this fast-developing area of practice useful although the work now needs to be revised with a new edition to take account of internet law report developments since 2000.Action Group.<br /><br />Counsel will find the emphasis on recent and unreported case law in this fast-developing area of practice useful although the work now needs to be revised with a new edition to take account of internet law report developments since 2000.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Sterotypical and idealized characters and sex scenes that grow boring with their repetition.  If that was the authors intent, then I must say \\"well done.\\"  But I doubt it.  The Marquis' place in literature is secure.

B004G6009U|5.0|I bought this Disney movie for my collection as I enjoyed them growing up and wanted to also be able to share with children that come to visit me and in time for my grand kids. The DVD was packaged very well and I especially like the outside cover that it comes in which protects the movie itself. It was received in wonderful condition and I have no complaints.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect with this book, I kept hearing about how great it was all over the internet so I decided to give it a read without ever reading the summary. This book really captured me for different reasons.<br />The first reason is that in my opinion this book is really well written. I like Chbosky's choice of narrative...I don't think the book would have had the same effect if it wasn't written as Charlie's letters to an anonymous friend. I feel the narrative really captures you and allows you to enter Charlie's world. I personally didn't really identify with the anonymous friend but knowing that this character was writing to someone made him seem more real to me.<br />The second reason I loved this book is because, considering Charlie's age and psychology, it makes sense for him to write anonymous letters to someone. His degree of loneliness during high school makes me really believe that he was trying to reach out to someone in anyway he could (specially since email wasn't as common when this book was written).<br /><br />The third reason I loved this book was because I loved Charlie and I don't really mean as a character but as the person I imagined he would be like. Book aside, I really believe that studying psychology changes your way of thinking...maybe it's because in my case at the beginning all the practice in trying to diagnose and understand came from watching movies and reading books. I think the reason I love Charlie so much is because I empathize with his particular way of being in a professional and personal way...this made me keep reading in the hopes that he would somehow figure out what was bothering him. I wasn't surprised by the ending, I had sort of figured it out before but I kept waiting for him to have a moment of discovery.<br />Honestly I found this book incredible. I was paralyzed and silent after I finished it. The ending gave me goosebumps and I'm really glad I read it. It has a Catcher in the Rye feel to it, but it didn't really bother me. I think the reason I liked this book and hated Catcher in the Rye is because even though Charlie and Holden have some similarities (teen angst), the both have different personalities in formation. Holden is more like a pessimistic antisocial narcissist while Charlie has more of a schizotypal passive aggressive personality in formation.<br /><br />I recommend this book to teenagers, young adults and adults for the pure pleasure of reading something interesting that I believe we all can relate to in a way.t didn't really bother me.

B0058YPL66|5.0|\\"Once Upon a Time\\" is the only new television program which I watched regularly during the 2011-12 TV season, and it can be appreciated equally well by both adults and children.<br /><br />  The show's plotline is cleverly constructed to mix its fairy-tale/fantasy elements with a somewhat drab modern-world existence in the sleepy little Maine town of Storybrooke, which none of its original residents are able to leave--unfortunate events always seem to befall those who try to do so. Each episode consists of a story line set in the \\"Enchanted Forest,\\" the fairy-tale/fantasy world, along with a parallel one set in Storybrooke involving the modern-day counterparts of the fantasy characters, although the two story lines don't necessarily end up the same way.<br /><br />  Trapped in Storybrooke by a powerful magical curse unleashed by the Evil Queen (Mayor Regina Mills in the town), the other residents there begin the series living a literally timeless, basically unchanging existence while the Queen gloats over them in triumph--of course none of them are conscious of their situation, but they are however aware of their lives being dominated by her in Storybrooke.<br /><br />  The purported rescuer of the magically-cursed town is Emma Swan, an orphan seemingly abandoned after her birth, who is manipulated into coming to Storybrooke (from Boston) on her twenty-eighth birthday by her biological son, ten-year-old Henry Mills, who is the adopted child of the mayor. (Emma and Henry are the only regular characters without \\"Enchanted Forest\\" counterparts.)<br /><br />  There are ongoing subplots in Storybrooke involving numerous other characters, notably the star-crossed romance between Mary Margaret Blanchard (Snow White), Henry's fourth grade teacher, and David Nolan (Prince Charming), who starts the series as a hospital patient in a coma, and the machinations of the program's other major villain, the mysterious pawn shop proprietor Mr. Gold (Rumplestiltskin), who owns much of the town. (As Gold explains to Emma about the townspeople, \\"They're afraid of Madame Mayor, but they're more afraid of me.\\")<br /><br />  The fantasy parts of the ongoing story don't always exactly match the classic fairy-tale plotlines, although they're at least similar enough to be easily identifiable, and (unlike the modern-day parts) they're not necessarily shown in chronological order--so it's valuable to view the different episodes more than once to appreciate how the 'pieces of the puzzle' fit together. There are sublties within each episode that analytical adults should be able to appreciate, including some of the characters' names, while children would certainly enjoy the skillful and innovative presentation of the fairy-tale/fantasy elements.<br /><br />  This is a television series whose episodes can be viewed more than 'once upon a time' and still be quite entertaining...the town.

B003O86FMW|3.0|Mainly read this since Hunger Games left many unanswered questions.  \\"Catching Fire\\" answered some of these questions, but raised others.  So now I have to read the third installment.  The first installment was better than the second but not that good.  I only hope the third will be the best.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm going to make this simple.  This is the best novel that I have purchased in this price range on Amazon.  If you are looking for a good, inexpensive fantasy novel, buy this one.  You better hurry though, because this author is too good to keep his novels at $2.99.
B005FUTC86|5.0|While chatting with my daughter-in-law, she told me she had never watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. This meant that my 3 granddaughters had not seen it either. I went straight to my Amazon Prime Acccount and had it delivered to there home. When I saw the girls the following weekend, they were singing the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang songs. They loved it! A must see classic for children - and adults :)
B00943SQCI|1.0|I haven't been too fond of Mr. Burton's work for several years, but this takes the cake. He takes a cult classic, a horror soap opera whose cheesy fun factor was the fact that actors, writers and directors took everything seriously while working on a horror soap opera, and turned into one of his idiotic menagerie of weirdness and oddities. The only saving grace in this movie was Eva Green. Everyone else, from Burton's partner in crime Johnny Depp to the kids were all miscast. That includes Mr. Burton himself. Run from this movie, unless you are a masochist.

1451627297|5.0|I never read Steven King novels but this book is very different. He combines a good story with history. It is not horror fiction but can make you think!! I am impressed with his writing ability and was immediately drawn into the story. Don't be put off by its length. I could not put it down. It is not intended to prove or disprove a conspirator theory but tells a good story about what could happen if history could be changed..

B007STBUIW|5.0|i have seen this movie so many times that i have lost count.obviously i like the movie.i have it on dvd and was not planning on buying it on blueray for a while.however i read a review on high def digest and blueray.com which indicated that this was a must own blueray.i decided to purchase it and have to agree with the reviewers.i have watched the movie and was totally involved immersed and entertained by the movie as i was when i saw it for the first time.i am again reluctant to go swimming in lake michigan.this is a great blueray transfer of this movie.audio and picture are great.5 star in my opinion.this movie transfer is the definitive reason why you would want to upgrade from dvd.another great transfer is titanic recently released.another favorite of mine that is so much better on blueray is zulu circa 60s stanley baker michael caine et al.this is what blueray is about.

B008MG1E4A|1.0|This book, while interesting, leaves the reader with the feeling that maybe it should not have been written. In  my opinion, our military needs for certain details to be kept secret.  I can see where some of these details regarding procedures, materials used in the operation, even locations of events, might benefit those who want to do harm to our nation.  I do not question the patriotism of the author.  In fact, I'd like to thank him for his service, and wish him well, but just feel that this book should have not been published.
B002DOSBMK|2.0|This book is an extremely difficult read. I really wanted to pick up the Drizzt saga from the chronological beginning, so I chose to start with Homeland. I was immediately turned off by the constantly changing character perspective. In five paragraphs you get the situation from five different points of view. Where's the drama? Where's the mystery? I don't want to hear the bad guy(s) spell out his thoughts - I want to figure them out for myself!<br /><br />I found this book extremely irritating and almost couldn't finish it. I'm not even sure I'm going to attempt another Drizzt book. It's that bad. If you're like me and looking to start out reading about the dark elf hero, do yourself and favor and choose another book to start with.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Someone else said it. \\"I wanted to like it\\"<br />The bad lady destroyed everyone/thing and get a little knife pick from snow white and dies....??? didn't I see more than seven little people?
B004NS710C|3.0|i had this movie recomended to me to watch. i liked but wasnt crazy for it. im thrilled that my kindle fire provides movies to watch if so enclined its great to watch on the small screen anywhere you want.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is so simple and totally addicting just like the arcade game only you can play as much as you want. I regimens it highly (:
B008BIN9EW|4.0|Good strategy game.  21 levels in campaign mode.  You can also play solo maps and vs. online.  I'd prefer more campaign levels, but it's still a pretty good value.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was mostly good and it's well written but the ending could have been a lot better. I was disappointed.
1439102813|4.0|It was an excellent journey through the stages of Alzheimers, dementia.  I could really relate since my husband has the disease and we are living day to day.  He is to the stage where he does not recognize me or family.  So sad, nut was reassuring to know, this is common for the disease.  I am in the process of trying to learn as much as I can so I will know what to expect!  It is a horrible wasting disease, and lonely for those on the outside looking in.  The patient lives in his or her own world!!!  Alice was so young as was my husband.  We have been 14 years at this already, and he is still only 73.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|...(or at least I did)..what's really going on. There are a few possibilities that make you go, \\"Oh, no, not THAT old chestnut!\\" But wait ! No chestnuts here! This book leads you through several twists and turns until the final chapter. Excellent, excellent work, Mr. Crouch~!
B005QUQ99K|3.0|I would have to repeat a lot of what some people have said, it looks cool - it's got awesome \\"gold blades\\" all over the thing - (why do these ninjas obsess over gold objects? - oh well) and well... it's Kai and who doesn't love Kai?<br /><br />But the negatives are... the kit is super advanced to put together, whatever the age is on this thing, add two years at lest. Most of the pieces are from the advanced construction kits.<br /><br />Second, this vehicle \\"transforms\\" but whenever your kid does it - one of the 4 wings snaps off and he runs over to you and asks you to put it back together. This kit is one of those top contenders for: \\"I am going to super glue this together so it doesn't fall apart ever again\\" awards.<br /><br />Of the four vehicle kits, this one is the \\"entry level purchase\\" because it's the cheaper of the four, but I hope the other 3 are better constructed for the money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much, well written first hand account of what really happened NOT what our \\"regime\\" wants us to believe happened,
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This fun game has some great powerups, my favorite being the hopper. The game play is easy but gets challenging as you go.  There is a slot machine game you can play after your game as well.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Sweet songs with interesting and realistic lyrics. Nice listening when driving, brings peace and good thoughts. Whether every song had the same entonation, confortable and smooth voice the hammer in the ear would beat in an infinitive frequency and therefore spending miminum energy to the maximum pleasure.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the tag feature in bookmarks and notes. On the downside- the program force closes sometimes, but my my latest edits are saved on reopening. A very nice program overall and it has my recommendation for Bible students at all levels.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just don't give 5's...but this was an amazing piece of fiction. I too have my favorites that I reread again and again like: 1984, Historian, Grapes of Wrath, Dune, and I can add Wool to my list. I would love to see this made into a movie; it is so imaginative and thought provoking. I can see a whole universe of Wool...thanks Hugh!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is cool.  Big numbers...easy to use.  I always have my Kindle Fire with me but not always a calculator so this helps at works etc. if I need one.  The price was right, too!
B008EAV4NK|5.0|Excellent book for children!!  This book is great for counting, colors, etc.  It will keep your toddler's attention and provide lots of fun opportunities for sharing.  The ending, when the caterpillar becomes a butterfly, is wonderful for talking about how we all start out little and grow into the wonderful person we can be.  What a fantastic book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found this book very intriguing. It was a little slow in the beginning but then a quarter of the way in it captured me through to the end. It is a must read.

0307592731|5.0|Wonderful narrative of a woman who thinks she can get back to or find who she truly is on a 1,100 mile trek on the PCT. She is not prepared she is haphazard. She survives inspite of mistakes. This book is honest and the author is an unapologetic feminist.
0321714113|5.0|The book is well organized and well written. The fact that the authors choose to explain the intricacies in simple English, makes it easy for the reader to perceive and understand the concept.<br /><br />Programming background is required though to appreciate the presentation.<br /><br />If some one wanted to quickly understand how do I deal with pointers, the chapter on Dynamic Memory and Smart Pointers, is a good read presented with good examples.<br /><br />Chapter 15 has a good presentation of OOPs concepts. The example of the Query class is a pretty good demonstration of the OOPs concepts.<br /><br />We also have a nice introduction to specialized libraries. However, not much is covered since the authors claim the goal was not to over all of the specialized libraries.<br /><br />Exception handling is presented well too with good examples.<br /><br />However, the topics addressed in Chapter 19. could have been addressed in chapters that were dedicated for discussing those relevant topics. To me it looks like what ever was missed or forgotten were all crammed into one last chapter. Its just my opinion though. Otherwise, even that is well written.<br /><br />The authors also have pointed out new features in C++11. For those that are keen to upgrade and take note, they serve well.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is a moving, motivational drama about two individuals who connect in a way that is awe inspiring and uplifiting. Former lives that they are each trying to escape come crashing back to surround them in conflict and no matter how hard they run it continues to seek them out and draw them together like a heat seeking missle.Finally they come to the realization that they are bound by forces they can not fight and learn to love and live together in the reality of the situations.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a delightful series about an aristocratic family during World War I.  It is filled with intrigue, humor, and has a great love story underlying the saga.  We thoroughly enjoyed watching it and are waiting anxiously for Season 3 to be available.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a lot of fun fun fun.  I recommend it because it isn't impossible to solve each puzzle and isn't overly easy either
B008VBYN80|4.0|this game is okay but you have to have others you are plavying because you run out of life quickly. but that is okay with me I just move onto my next game. they want you to buy diamonds but I do not. its just a game so play and enjoy while you can.

B002UBRFDC|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book. If a Western mind wants to know how someone from the Far East thinks, this is it. I understand the Japanese culture so much better now. Honor, duty, family, life and death, and how they view war and betrayal. Clavell also shows how religious beliefs and traditions greatly contrast, especially during this time period. After reading this book I even borrowed the miniseries from a friend and watched it. Not bad, but the book was far better. Great read!

B0064NTZKI|4.0|A very good documentary on Woody Allen's life and film career.  The most interesting part is part 1 of course, the rise of Woody Allen from a teenager who sent jokes into the newspaper into a comedy writer who passed his jokes on to many famous comedians of the 50s including Mort Saul.  He wrote for Your Show of Shows and other TV shows.  Finally he turns to stand up comedy and writing screenplays such as What's Up Pussycat?.  The films are big hits but are terrible and finally he works out a deal in which he makes his own films but has full control.  That leads to his heyday in the 1970s in which he does his best work.  This period ends with Stardust Memories, a film that is talked of in length and said to be not very good.  I personally like it and the documentary uses clips from this movie more than any other.<br /><br />Part 2 has a different structure.  Instead of chronological, it introduces the present first, films such as Midnight in Paris are covered first and other recent films.  Woody Allen is making films in Europe instead of New York City and some have become very popular.  After covering this period the documentary goes back to the 1980s when Woody made films with Mia Farrow.  She is treated respectfully and commentators including Woody Allen are full of praise for her.  Then the big bogey in the room drops, the scandal when Mia Farrow discovered nude photographs of Soon Yi in his apartment.  Woody claims it must have been a Freudian slip and says it was good fortune as it lead him to his current wife.  What is not mentioned is the sexual abuse charges against Dylan and when talking about the children, a friend says he had 2 children with Mia not 3.  I felt bad that Moses was left out.  It is mentioned that Woody was never allowed to see the children but doesn't mention why the court barred him from seeing the kids.  The movie Husbands and Wives was finished during the crisis and it affected Bullets Over Broadway.  Later movies such as Mighty Aphrodite are covered.  The documentary sums up that he is happy now and has two children with Soon Yi.  I'm not sure if they could have handled the crisis any other way with Woody's cooperation but it is a shame that the situation isn't dealt with and stays unexamined.  Soon Yi and their children are only shown in photographs and not interviewed.are covered.  The documentary sums up that he is happy now and has two children with Soon Yi.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Well made film. Having read the books first, I found it easy to follow. I liked all the characters and the cinematography is excellent. Looking forward to the next movie.
0824835921|5.0|This book is fantastic. I was looking for an alternative method of Kanji study that would really make the characters stick in my memory. This method is truly a revelation! I am now looking at Kanji in a whole new light. But pease stick with the Author's instructions for studying this way. Very highly recommended.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Despite its simple side scrolling missions, this game is very well made and very entertaining. I would recommend for sure. Looks great on the kindle fire.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I had been curious about this book because of the uproar when it came out. I purposefully read some of the better reviews (after reading the book, I agree) and then some of the worst. To be honest, I expected political sniping, and it was there. There were others, however, that focused on what a lousy writer he is, what a lousy storyteller he is, what a big ego he has, etc. What struck me the most was that despite the fact that the SEALs were bothered by the fact that they were included in the story, most of these bad reviews insisted in exposing his real name, which told me that it was more than a mere book review. It went beyond that.<br /><br />While not a Tom Clancy, I found the book up to the best reviews. It was very well written and had a good flow to it, with retrospect and flashbacks when required. The first half was about his career as a SEAL, with the second half about the raid. Anyone who has been in the military will identify with much of what he went though.<br /><br />If you are invested in the official story of the Bin Laden raid, this is not the book for you. He debunks much of it, and compared to the official story the actual one (although compelling) is almost a letdown. It is very different, which I think is the reason for the bad reviews.<br /><br />Much is left out for security reasons, but there is much in this book about the training, the effort, and - most of all - the comraderie of the SEALs. I highly recommend this book.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Great action and suspense and if u love medievil stuff will fall for this game in a heartbeat but like more so we can get Thule updates for this game

B001KWTBVQ|4.0|This was a very nice movie...clean and sweet.  We enjoyed it. It was nice for adults and children and I would recommend it.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|Loved, loved, loved it.  If you're a fan of sci-fi this movie is a must-add to the roster of great sci-fi.  With amazing characters this great sci-fi flick becomes a character study, even robots enhance the drama. In my opinion best scene ever in a movie-spoiler alert-when Roonie Mara's character performs surgery to rid her body of an alien-epic.  Must see.
B0031RS7X6|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. I found it funny and easy to read. It was a bit predictable but still a good story line. Glad I purchased it. Have endothermic books from this author which I have also enjoyed. Would recommend.

B006BAEQB2|3.0|I have read a lot of Gregory's books and I had trouble caring about the main character seeing as she was a little girl through the majority of the story.  I know that she became older throughout the story but Gregory didn't make me feel as though had grown up.  There wasn't much depth to the characters, very little action and after reading the Lady of the Rivers this was a bit of a letdown.

You do not know how, but you know Reacher will always succeed, no matter how impossible his mission is.

1476712042|4.0|M/F romance    This story follows the very torrid and obsessive relationship dynamic of tattooed bad boy Travis Maddox (mommy issues) and the seemingly innocent Abigail Abernathy (daddy issues) during the course of her freshmen year in college.    They first find each other during one of Travis's secret fight club matches on the college circuit... Travis, also a college student, sets his sights on the 18 yr old Abby and pursues her like a madman.  He drops his womanizing ways and wants only her sensing she is someone who will never leave him.  Abby has been running from her daddy issues and is trying to start fresh, but being with someone like Travis would rehash that whole relationship dynamic all over again in her love life.  She resists and resists... and pretends they can only be friends, thus driving Travis nuts.    I gotta admit, the writing isn't bad at all here, but I almost laughed this book off as a 7th grade romance.  It's definitely the Young Adult genre... but with a pretty serious edge.  There is some fighting violence and Travis is full of rage.  There's a whole lot of alcohol consumption.  And there was sex here, but it wasn't graphic or gratuitous. Heck, I found The Hunger Games equally as violent (albeit mostly asexual), but it's a massive hit with most young people I know.  And this one is going to be a movie as well from what I've read.  I was curious at what the fuss was about... this is not my usual romance genre.    It turned into a very addictive read with some unexpected twists.  And their relationship dynamic got more and more fascinating for me.  It's kind of a Sid and Nancy story where Nancy is actually the healing force this time around.  Not an unhappy, self-destructive ending... but these two are never going to be a traditional church-going couple, lol.  Yet they do grow and change and mature for the better.    I can certainly understand the criticism of this novel... if you're a concerned parent or if you prefer less dysfunctional romances.  But I don't see a point in censoring dysfunctional relationships (even in the romance genre) as they help us to examine ourselves and the people we relate to... and the whole train wreck is just plain entertaining and engrossing to follow.  Then again, I may have an excessively high tolerance for melodrama due to the lesfic romance I normally enjoy reading.  What can I say.  I'm actually looking forward to this movie myself if they ever make it, lol.    A final note:  This book is written from Abby's point of view.  The sequel (Walking Disaster) is written from Travis's point of view.  If I were 18-19 again and found something like this to read... I'd probably have enjoyed it even more and given it 5 stars.
B003XU02QG|3.0|Good action scenes, cinematography, etc. but the tone of this movie is strange -- like we are supposed to like or admire the Romans, though they are the invaders. (I guess it's hard to identify with the protagonist if he's a creep)...Maybe the Romans would have found the Picts to be fairly likeable if they weren't trying to kill them and take their land. You never know...........<br /><br />A better movie concerning the same subject is the Eagle -- which doesn't seem as forced as this film...

B004AUGJS8|4.0|The movie is riveting and sad - a morbidly fascinating study of schizophrenia, sociopathy and asperger's syndrome and the victimology that follows.  It's unsettling to know that a murderer is wandering scot-free around my state of Florida.  Justice frequently does not prevail.

B008JB4XX2|5.0|This album has very good songs, jammin tunes and excellent workout songs for the gym.  Keeps you pumped up and motivated.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|Don't look for anything close to character development in this movie. If you're a Liam Neeson fan you'll be very disappointed because he doesn't get much on screen time and the role is lighter than air. I think his sole purpose was lending some star power in the trailers. The special efx are pretty nice and we thought adding the veteran's and Mighty Mo' was a top notch idea and was done nicely. Other than that this was a hughe miss!  3 Stars for vets, Mighty Mo and the aliens...that's all!

0553275976|4.0|It may take readers few chapters to acclimate themselves to the breakneck pace of The Bonfire of the Vanities, but the time is an investments that pays off in a wonderful, entertaining tale of an era that not too long ago provoked intense social discussion.  Thomas Wolff's best seller evokes a period where New York City tried to crawl out of the fiscal doldrums of the mid to late 1970s.  The Federal Reserve Board decided in 1979 to stop defending interest rates, which led to unprecedented trading in the bond market. Price was inversely related to interest rates, and firms that could price bonds properly in a time of fluctuating interest rates could make big money.  Some of these professionals earned enormous amounts of money.  This veneer of gold beside a decaying city provided the backdrop for Wolff's tale.<br /><br />The urban decay of the 1950s became an epidemic in the 1960s, then a fact of life in the 1970s.  Cities may not have gotten worse in the 1970s, but its symptoms were more prevalent.  New York City defaulted on some municipal bonds in 1975.  It had a massive power outage in 1977, and Howard Cosell announced during a post-season game that the Bronx was burning due to a fire visible from Yankee Stadium.  Though New York City has never been one to dwell on its historical sights, the seventies saw unprecedented dilapidation in Grant's Tomb and other landmarks.  Most subway cars were plastered with graffiti.<br /><br />Within the city, small enclaves of wealth took foothold in areas such as Park Avenue and the Upper East Side.  The Upper West Side had transformed from the area that Saul Bellow wrote about in the late 1950s to another yuppie haven.  These residents still had many of the fears of the rest of the city that its former residents, who fled to the suburbs and elsewhere, wished to escape - particularly when they were not traveling in familiar areas.  Sherman McCoy and Maria Ruskin exhibited those fears when they took a wrong turn off the Triboro bridge and ended up, probably, following the Bruckner expressway to somewhere in the Hunts Point neighborhood.<br /><br />The silence of the victim, Henry Lamb, is contrasted by the boisterous protests of Reverend Reginald Bacon, a character that Wolff merely borrowed from the Reverend Al Sharpton.  Sharpton wasn't well-known during the setting of Bonfire of the Vanities, but he began to make a name for himself with his racially polarized stances on isolated cases of urban misunderstanding in the mid-1980s.  Sharpton fed into sales of Wolff's book in 1987 when the reverend accepted the story of Tawana Brawley, and launched a furious campaign against the district attorneys of Westchester County for covering-up a crime.  In fact, a hoax had been committed - and a jury ruled that Sharpton had known this, yet recklessly and maliciously attacked a junior prosecutor named Stephen Pagones for inaction.  Pagones later won a substantial lawsuit against Sharpton, who never paid, claiming indigence.<br /><br />The victim's mother, Annie Lamb, was a member of Bacon's church, and came to the Reverend with the story of her son hit by a Mercedes and lying in intensive care while the driver of the car fled the scene.  Sherman McCoy did flee the scene, because he thought the two boys were up to no good.  It wasn't necessarily Lamb that put fear into Sherman and Maria; it was the large boy in the Celtics jacket who was with Henry at the time.  The actions of the yuppies are not too far removed from what many people would have done in the same situation.  A friend of mine told me a story about a carjacking in Overton - in Miami - which began when someone ran in front of the car, forcing the driver to slam on the breaks.  The car was then attacked by several others in cahoots with the man who ran in front of the car to stop it.  The moral of his story was that his father should have run the guy over and gotten the hell out.  Nobody wants to be a hit-and-run driver, but nobody wants to berobbed, either.  It is a thought-provoking dilemma.<br /><br />The Lamb Case was publicized by an alcoholic reporter in a small local paper that hadn't written a good story in several years.  Peter Fallow was destined to be fired from the City Light for ineffectiveness at his job, and his personal life consisted of mooching free drinks and food at a local pub by finding a sucker to get stuck with the bill.  If Fallow woke before noontime, it was because someone woke him up.  This story was a remarkable boost to his career - in fact, we learn at the end just how far he could run with the story.<br /><br />A number of coincidences must occur before this case can get any traction - and, remarkably, they do!  For example, Maria is having an affair with an artist, Filippo Chirazzi, while she is entertaining McCoy.  This artist also knew Caroline Heftshank, one of the Brits who frequented Leicester's, a local hangout of Brits in America.  When he failed to call Caroline, whose interest in the artist failed to match his interest in her, she told Peter Fallow about the artist's involvement with Maria and some conversations that linked Maria to Sherman McCoy.<br /><br />Nearly every character in the story has an ulterior motive, and how these play out is a remarkable social statement of the decade.  The power-broker becomes a scared, witless dolt.  The beauty with the brown-lipstick distracts the married assistant prosecutor.  Even a simple matter of speech is laden with innuendo.  Wolff captures the decade in one compelling, impossible-to-put-down story that ought to appeal to anyone.
B005DC68NI|4.0|There are quite a few e-books out on this subject, but I haven't read any others so I can't compare. I chose \\"Let's get digital\\" based on Amazon reviews and I can say that I'm not disappointed.<br /><br />I've spent a lot of hours online researching digital publishing, often seeing conflicting advice or comments where there was obvious self-interest. Quite confusing really. This book has answered most of my questions (and ones I didn't even know to ask). Money well spent as far as I'm concerned.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|this is a book that you cannot put down. You will understand while reading this true account why the government wants to punish the author for telling the truth. A compelling story of our very best fighting men who got the job done. Bravo, and well done.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Kathy Reichs has done it again.  Bones Are Forever grabbed me from the first page and held on until the final sentence.  Both Reichs and Brennan are out in full force form.  Having her and Andy Ryan working together and focussed on the case was as riveting as always.  The plot and mystery were well woven and well paced.  The emotional twists and turns were wrenching and all too believable.  The supporting characters, both familiar and new, were enhancements and not distractions.  The setting was unique and as much a part of the story as the characters.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|This movie was obviously marketed towards 12 year old boys, but still manages to be a great movie. It's very visual, so the widescreen is a must. Important things get cut off in the full screen edition, so don't waste your money on that.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Really fun free game. lots of fun while having nothing to do at work and long road trips and plane trips.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Wonderful adaptation of a frank miller classic. I loved the Batman Year one animation as well but this one was very impressive. Unlike Year One this is not a faithful frame by frame translation to animation however it's still the same idea and some of the images come straight from the pages of the comic book and are recreated in this modernized version of the 1960's \\"Dark Knight Returns\\". I recommend this for anyone likes Batman.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love it because if kindle fire dose not tell u it can tell u on the app.it is awesome and cool and wicked
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Awesome cover, does not block speakers:<br /><br />I looked at all the covers that were available for my new Kindle Fire HD, and I could not believe the prices. Some covers cost 1/3 of what a brand new Fire would cost.  That just seemed wrong. The Belkin cover was the cheapest one, so it seemed like a good deal, but my big concern was that from the product photo I could not tell if it would block the speakers. So I ordered the cover, it came right away, popped my Kindle Fire HD into it, and blasted my favorite music. The cover is perfect! It doesn't block the speakers, since the device is curved at the edges.  Sound is great.<br /><br />Holds the device securely:<br /><br />The edge holders are also really sturdy, and hold the device tightly. They are really easy to slip off and get to the device.<br /><br />Protects the screen:<br /><br />The inner cover has a nice felt on it that seems like it will be really kind to the glass on the device.<br /><br />I don't write many reviews, but I like this cover so much I had to let you know this is the cover for you!
B008YP272M|5.0|Even though this book is rather short and can easily be read in one sitting it is well worth the read. It is an interesting insight into the life of a cancer patient and the thing that makes it a great read is that this cancer patient was one of the best thinkers and writers of our time. I would recommend it to anyone.
B008MZPVP4|5.0|Great music and song writing.This is so much better then half the garbage that comes out these days.Phils vocals sound great and song writing is excellent.Hope they make more albums like this.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Martin's second installment is no less enchanting than his first; readers will gladly endure sleepless nights reading this one cover to cover, too.  Although a profusion of characters populate his works, the wise reader foregoes memorizing names and lets the story wash over them.  And a deluge it is.
