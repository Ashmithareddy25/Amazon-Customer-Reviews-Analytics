B000EQHHJW|5.0|Grat Presentation, one of the best Opera Films I've ever seen!!!!! As usually the DVD's made by Deustche Grammophon are one of the best. Pavarotti in one of his best opera roles.
1416511946|5.0|This book was amazing! It gives great insight into the life of a famous rockstar, Nikki Sixx. This guy was in Montley Crue and spent his hours off stage getting high on what ever he could find. Eventually, it cultivated into a huge out of control addiction. But the addiction that really threw him over the edge was heroin. It was true love. There are lots of pictures and it is arranged in a diary format. Between the entries there are quotes from people who witness his abuse and offer a second perspective. This format gives the book a nice full 360 view of the whole experience, so you never miss a beat. Read it and you will not forget it.
B000008H4E|5.0|About two decades ago I discovered Vangelis (thanks to Chariots of Fire), and soon after I gobbled up all works of his I could get my hands on. One of these works was Portraits, which had Vangelis and Anderson together--I fell in love w/ their music and have bought all the music I can with the two of them performing together.    Short Stories does not disappoint. Some of the music I have on other CDs, but others are new to me. All pieces are great. This is a very good addition to the library of all Vangelis/Anderson-philes.
0060763280|5.0|A lot of what's in this book I've read before in other books on creating wealth. However, the author's writing style is pretty entertaining. It's a great book to keep yourself inspired if you've read other books but lost your motivation.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I bought this for several reasons...primarily because it was released for free and I want to reward risk-takers in the entertainment industry. The bonus features are top notch, hilarious, and worth twice the price.     I strongly encourage the purchase of this brilliant movie.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This album is wonderful. Love all the love songs. It really shows you how Keith was feeling while in the process of making this album. More love songs added to my iPod now : ) GET IT! You won't regret it!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I agree with a previous viewer's comment that it's unfortunate Amazon copied all the reviews of the previous edition of this DVD. The color on this edition is MUCH better.     It also comes with an interesting book (which could have been longer). It has quite a few (sometimes too small) pictures of the production. Pictures of the cast without makeup are particularly interesting. There's one amusing story about Alison Steadman, who was quite a bit younger and prettier than her character (Mrs. Bennett). It involves a crew member not recognizing her when she was in her costume ... funny.     We watched the previous edition of this DVD many times, and we still enjoy the story. This newer, better DVD just makes it that much more enjoyable.

B001EBC8U4|5.0|Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is one of those rare books about which I get to say the following:  it was too short.  I reached the end of it and mourned that I would no longer be a part of the lives of Juliet, Dawsey, Kit, Isola, Sidney and so many others.<br /><br />Juliet Ashton, a Londoner, receives a letter from a resident of Guernsey, seeking information regarding Charles Lamb.  From this rather innocuous beginning comes an epistolary novel featuring romance, war, deprivation, mourning, and the healing nature of reading and friendship.  Told via letters between Juliet and her editor and then the residents of the formerly-occupied Guernsey, the novel wrapped itself around me like a warm quilt, and I was loath to step back out into the cold world after finishing the last page.<br /><br />Juliet is so arch and clever that my laughter rang out through the house as I read her letters.  Then, sometimes only a few moments later, I'd be reaching for a tissue.  Mary Ann Shaffer is a writer of great talent, and her loss is a deep one.  It breaks my heart to think that we will never hear her voice again.  As for the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, I'll carry them in my heart and memory always.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|When LILO & STITCH first premiered on DVD, there was quite a bit of bonus material already, but this new \\"Big Wave\\" 2-disc edition really does pay off the package claim that there are more than two hours' worth.<br /><br />Much of that time is taken up by the feature-length documentary that literally follows the creative team, particularly writer/directors Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois, from initial concepts to a glamorous premiere at Cannes (where, by the way, we get to enjoy a continental breakfast with Chris Sanders as he brings his bakery products to life on the tray).<br /><br />It also contains the original climactic scene in which Stitch wildly pilots a 747 through the city. This seemed completely out of the realm of reality at the time to the filmmakers, but then 911 happened and it was totally changed. (I was working on the graphic novel version at the time and was sent a new script in order to change it, too.)<br /><br />Making an animated film is not all sunshine and talking muffins, though. Sanders and Deblois are also seen in the midst of a disagreement, capturing a moment that does not appear to be staged. A lot of what the two explain on the audio commentary is also supplemented with the generous supply of deleted scenes on the discs.<br /><br />One of the most interesting comments the filmmakers share is that they consulted with someone at Pixar who suggested a very pivotal plot point with the \\"Ugly Duckling\\" book. This was before the Disney*Pixar merger but clearly Pixar's influence was felt. In fact, Lilo & Stitch may be one of the most Pixar-like of the Eisner era Disney films because it has a very odd storyline. Perhaps this was because it was made in Florida, 3,000 miles away from day to day \\"input,\\" just as Pixar remains six hours away.<br /><br />The only thing that seems to have been shoehorned in the film was the teen pop song at the end, which Sanders and Deblois dart with comic sarcasm in their commentary. The music video of this song, by the A-Teens, are among the few items not repeated on this new edition. Most of them were, in part, added to the documentary feature.<br /><br />Chris Sanders' presence on the bonus materials is well worth noting. He was let go from Disney after a publicly-known creative stalemate with John Lasseter about AMERICAN DOG, which was reassigned and renamed BOLT and ironically released at the same time as this edition. But it speaks highly of Lasseter's integrity and character as a human being, as well as a person who cares about Disney, that Sanders' important role in Disney history was not obscured or removed because of ego or corporate complication.<br /><br />It would it be terribly wrong to eliminate the contributions and commentary of anyone who has made a contribution to the Disney organization and history and even more heinous if they were attributed to someone else. Committing such an act would be a disservice to Disney and the people who are part of its heritage, be it past or present. It would be like saying Ward Kimball animated STEAMBOAT WILLIE because Ub Iwerks left the Company. This would reflect poorly on  professionalism, ethics and respect for the contributions of Disney people, past and present (remember Walt's quote about people?).<br /><br />To the immense credit of everyone connected with this edition of LILO AND STITCH, such a tremendous, unconscionable act did not occur in this particular instance. It's a fine new DVD release, which truly delivers a lot of new material and lives up to its claim of \\"much, much more.\\"ms not repeated on this new edition.

B001TH16DI|5.0|Great job Paramount, however it would have been nice to have a little more.  I understand the problems with the Motion Picture.  I will let it pass for now.  The Director's Edition used the 480i tape to create the new edits and there is no going back.  Thank you for releasing 6 movies at once and not making us wait for 3 years to get the entire collection.  Let's get the final four by the end of the year!  It would have been nice to have both versions on the Blu Ray...or at least the deleted scenes on the disc!!!  I will enjoy this set.  You only live once and I love this series!
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This new cd reminds me of Golden Road which was released a little over 5 years ago. It is very melodic with almost an 80's pop/rock sound on \\"my heart is open.\\" Unlike Keith's last album which had a lot of piano, this one is more simplistic which showcases more of his great guitar work.   This is definetely my favorite since Golden Road and will be for a long time.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|\\"The Return of the King\\" is the final conclusion of Gondor´s Fate and in this score you will live exactly the same as Aragorn when he remembers Minis Terth as his homeland and capital of Men´s Kingdom, Gondor.   With the Theme of \\"The King\\" (repeated in the whole 3 movies when it comes to talk about the kingdom that needs to be reclaimed by Isildur´s heir) you will live Aragorn´s Fate as sound mixes in your ears with songs like: \\"The Lightining of the Beacons\\" and \\"Journey to the Cross Roads\\".   Sauron´s Eye Fall and Dernhelm Battle will rise images of the movie to your mind, Faramir´s Sacrifice will move you to a weightlessness and oniric athmosphere, and the long tender end of Bilbo´s voyage with the Elves will catch your dreams and translate them to the Middle Earth in your homeplace.    This is a Must Have in homes of all Soundtrack fans!!
B001KKRD6I|5.0|(\\"Carboniferous\\" by Zu)<br /><br />Zu are a Roman (as in from Rome, Italy) instrumental trio consisting of drummer Jacopo Battaglia, bassist Massimo Pupillo and saxophonist Luca T. Mai.  They specialize in the sort of wild, loud experimentalism that is constantly compared to the more aggressive recordings of John Zorn (i.e., Electric Masada).  Those expecting Jazz or other fusionoid tendencies should be warned, though.  Zu are definitely more of a rock band--a brawny, rabid noise rock band to be more precise.  While their past efforts had a \\"jazz\\" element (courtesy of those saxophones), on \\"Carboniferous,\\" they attempt to crush your skull and grind it into so much dirt to prove their R-O-C-K credentials.  Sure, there's no guitars to be found, but Pupillo distorts his bass to produce low-end riffs n' roars.  Likewise, Mai's saxophone never noodles; it squeals, honks and gernerally skronks things up.  Battaglia cements the deal; those are no brushes in his hands for sure--his relentlesness is closer to the industrial of early Swans or the math-metal of Helmet.  As a matter of fact, with their whiplash time changes and tempo shifts, they eliminate all kinds of clutter normally associated with jazz, such as soloing or even melody.  Ipecac recordings head lunatic Mike Patton was so impressed with their chops that he not only signed them, but also contributes the only vocals on the album for the track \\"Soulympics\\" in his patented gibberish grunting.  As if to also prove they don't don't need no stinkin' vocals, this is the weakest track on the album.  In fact, the only moment of relative restraint here is album closer \\"orc,\\" but even that seems designed to kill.  What's all the more impressive, though, is that it never grows tiring.  These monsters are good for both moshing and listening.  In fact, this is one of the best of '09 so far.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of: Lightning Bolt, The Flying Luttenbachers, Helmet, Blind Idiot God.  Not to mention repeatedly slamming your head in a car door.car door.
B00005V9IL|4.0|A solid cast of characters and an interesting premis drive this sci-fi offering.  Ed Harris is the tool pusher, the #1 man on an oil rig, except that this rig is located on the ocean floor. When a US Navy submarine sinks in the vicinity Harris and his crew are caught up in the middle of an international drama.  Things get take a turn for the grim when a team of Navy SEALS arrive at the undersea rig and take over...you'll have to watch to see what I mean.<br /><br />Likes:<br />1) I like the setting for the story - the deep sea<br />2) I like the assortment of characters that work on the rig, the intelligent and strong-willed woman engineer that designed the rig<br />3) The contrasting attitudes of the SEAL teams, especially their team leader<br />4) Some of the special effects are quite good - for example, the \\"water tentacle\\" is great<br />5) The portrayal of challenges of living in the deep-sea<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />1) The special effects used to depict the NTIs (watch and you'll see) are getting to be pretty dated, though they were good when the movie was originally released...that's about it.<br />2) There's way too much meaningless profanity sprinkled throughout the movie...though some would contend that such language would be essential for accurately portraying oil workers...I wonder.<br /><br />All in all this is an engaging and interesting bit of inner-space sci-fi.  If you enjoy sci-fi you will enjoy this, though it's doubtful that if you take a careful look that it will truly score 5 stars.<br /><br />This is a solid 4-star offering, no doubt about it.  You'll be glad you own your own copy.
B000BNI90O|5.0|This is the most important tale on Epic Fantasy written on history. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the trilogy \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and is a first contact with the world of the Middle Earth, and so does the soundtrack.   With songs as \\"Many Meetings\\", \\"The Council of Elrond\\" and \\"The Departure of Boromir\\" you will first hear the childs´ chorus in order to imagine the Elves lands and the One Ring that corrupts the soul of everyone who tries to hold it in his hands.  Frodo and Sam will begun a dramatic trip to send the One ring to the Flames of Mount Doom... and Howard Shore´s music will follow this hobbits in each step to make it more bearable.    \\"One Score to rule them all\\"
B0001I561E|4.0|Robin Williams as the unpredictable genie is the game winner for this movie.  At the same time Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, are good, and Jaffar and Jago are evil.  So the stage is set.<br /><br />Alassin is the poor unassuming hero with a heart of gold, and he becomes the hero only because of his attraction to the sultan's beautiful and headstrong daughter.  The villian does all he can to place himself in power, and the genie and the most cleaver character in the whole movie - the magic carpet - provide the comic relief.<br /><br />The movie is definitely watchable, it's fun, and extremely Disneyesque.<br /><br />You will definitely be glad you have your own copy of this disc.  It's a kid-pleaser, but it is not a 5-star offering in my opinion.  Very good, but not great.<br /><br />4 stars.
0240808452|5.0|[[VIDEOID:33156491]]Here's a very useful book not just for animators, but for anyone who do character drawings. It's called Force: Dynamic Life Drawing for Animators, authored by Michael D. Mattesi.<br /><br />First of all, this is a book for intermediate and advanced artists. Foundational knowledge of anatomy is required to fully appreciate and follow along with the lessons.<br /><br />This book is about creating realistic poses for life drawing. Examples show how forces inside the body and outside (gravity or objects) act on the human figure, and how the body reacts to the force.<br /><br />There are lots of tips and illustrated examples on strong and memorable poses, such as the using of structure and form, overlaps, foreshortening, silhouettes etc. The explanations are clear and simple, even very sketchy illustrated examples bring the point across with very few lines.<br /><br />While many instructional drawing books teaches how to draw, this book teaches how to think before drawing. Whenever I draw, I always remind myself of the tips to help prevent my characters from being too static.<br /><br />Additionally, there are also chapters on handling clothing, drawing on location and drawing animals.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
0767803434|4.0|Harrison Ford plays a US President that has traveled to Russia to make a deal with the Russians to fight terrorism, and to seal the fate of a rogue ultranationalist, former Soviet general.  When terrorists supporting that general slip aboard and then take over Airforce One, the president and his family are in danger.<br /><br />The action is good, and the bravado of Ford as the US president is exciting. I have to admit, however, that the believability of the entire story is pretty sketchy.  There are quite a few holes in the plot, the largest being the lack of an explanation about why a top secret service agent, the one over the President's security detail, would ever help terrorists.<br /><br />Even so, the drama and action are good.<br /><br />Those things together make for a good, but not completely outstanding show.<br /><br />4-stars...that's it...and perhaps a rather weak 4 stars at that.
1845767055|5.0|[[VIDEOID:33155911]]Paul Bonner is one of the finest fantasy illustrator around. This book is a collection of over 150 paintings he has created for many big name clients, namely Games Workshop, Mutant Chronicles, Fasa, Riot Minds and Rackham.<br /><br />I love his style of mixing stylized creatures, extreme details and a little quirkiness into all his paintings. Imagine a desperate monster holding a human hostage, or maybe an orc wearing the head of a mammoth as helmet. The details in the design of characters, costumes and background makes everything looks so believable.<br /><br />Although his paintings capture a frame in fantasy time, I always imagine what would happen in the next frame, to learn more about the story of that world. The composition is wonderful, always framing the scene when the characters are suspended in action.<br /><br />And all these paintings are done on traditional medium. There are a few photos of his workplace at the back.<br /><br />Throughout the book, there are writeup from people he has worked with. He also talks about his college days, his travels in Europe and his creative process.<br /><br />If you're interested in fantasy art with lots of orcs, dragons, warriors, intricate armour design and dinosaurs, this book is for you. Oh, there are no elves, but there are a few human character designs as well.<br /><br />The book is printed in low gloss high art quality paper.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|Jamal Malik, an 18 year old orphan coming from the slums of Mumbai, is one question away from winning RS 20 million on the show \\"Who wants to be a millionaire\\", only to be arrested by the police before the night of the final part of the show on suspecion of cheating. To prove his innocense to the police, he tells the story of his very tough life, indicating how he learned the answers to all the questions of the show in his own past.     This is my first Indian movie to see, and I have to say its GREAT!     Great Story!     Great Directing!     Great Acting!
B001O2MBMI|5.0|Again another singer who does not get the respect due in America. I had stated the same thing in a previous review of a dutch singer/songwriter who's CD I purchased awhile back named VanVelzen. I have heard some of her songs recently on the local radio station but it was not until I pulled up a pieced together video of a tv soap on YouTube and listened to the song attached to that video called \\"Run\\". It literally took my breathe away for a few seconds because her voice, the lyrics and music was so beautiful. Her look was so amazing as well. I know it is a Snow Patrol song originally but I love Leona Lewis's version even more. I could listen to this CD all day and never tire of it. Hope she becomes hugely successful in the states. I also love the Deluxe CD/DVD that Amazon offers because the videos of some of her songs are a nice bonus as well.
B001P9KR94|1.0|At least two times I heard the media refer to this at a feel good movie.  This movie made me feel terrible.  The only think that made me feel good was that the characters survived this movie, and it was finally over.  I would have felt good if the character won the money and then did something great with it to change the slums.  All the characters, save one, were black and white.  As opposed to say, Gran Torino, the movie I think should have won, which had characters that were black, white,grey, good, bad, and changeable.  Really depressing to me is that nothing has changed in the slums of Bombay(now Mumbai) since I was there 40 years ago, and nothing will until the culture changes.  If you want to see how the people have survived with dignity and compassion those forty years watch a real movie live Patrick Swayze's City of Joy!

B000MR9D5E|5.0|The Planet Earth DVD's are unbelievable!  There are few things we sit and watch entirely, but we don't want to miss any of these DVD's.  We can't even imagine the patience of the film crews.  We really enjoy the 'diaries' following each sections, that tell how some parts were filmed.  We'd recommend these to anyone - especially if you enjoy nature and want to learn more about this wonderful earth of ours!
1416585710|1.0|Okay, let me start off this review like all reviews start - I am a huge Stephen King fan. I first discovered him in 1989 and quickly devoured his entire back catalog and then every book he has published since then. A couple of his books I have even read twice. This book sucks, to put it bluntly. I cannot remember the last time I have ever been so bored reading a King book or any other book for that matter. After forty pages, which I consider being pretty patient, I just could not take it anymore and put it down. I was really mad because I had just purchased this book before going on a plane trip and I had nothing to read on the way back. I just stared out the window wishing I had purchased another book. I still could not believe that one of my favorite authors could publish something so boring and pointless. I hope this is just a fluke and he is not out of ideas, just writing for the sake of writing. At any rate, I would advise you not to waste any time with this mess. Pick up anything else. Even reading a cereal box would be more interesting than this.
B001CZVVUU|4.0|If you've been agonizing over which version of Massenet's delectable Manon to get, the Bastille Opera's take with gorgeous staging and costumes in traditional style with the superlative soprano singing of Fleming or the delightful singing duo of Dessay and Villazon in the Liceu production, along sashays Netrebko with Villazon in a stunning Blu ray recording directed by Vincent Paterson which looks very much a winner. Personally I prefer the first to the second not just because of the singing but sorry, McVicar's staging just leaves me cold. The Netrebko/Villazon version is time transposed from 18th century France to 1950's Paris but is rather enchanting and works well.The staging is visually interesting and the costumes marvellous especially in the promenade scene where some of the ladies seem to walk out of the pages of Vogue magazine and the high definition video shows this in all its color and splendour. But it is the singing/acting that wins hands down and the chemistry between this famous pair. Netrebko arrives Amiens in Act 1, a breathless starry-eyed Lolita enthralled by the prospect of glamour and as each Act unfolds she changes --a teaser in baby-doll lingerie frollicking in bed with Le Chevalier(Villazon); a glamour queen trophy paramour strutting the Concourse with rich playboy Bretigny for whom she has deserted Le Chevalier,a tornado in red beseiging Le Chevalier's sanctum in the abbey to get him back, a fur clad platinum blonde bombshell ala Marlyn Monroe urging him to risk all at the gambling table and a pathetic, bedraggled prisoner dying in Le Chevalier's arms. Anna as Manon,is a throbbing tour de force.As for the well known arias, Villazon scores with his      wistful \\"En fermant les yeux\\", dreaming of an idyllic life with Manon whilst she is barely able to look him in the face because she's already thinking of leaving him for a richer life with Bretigny. This scene fairly drips with pathos. His \\"Ah fuyez douce image\\" is sung with as much passion aspain. The lighter weight numbers are very enjoyable too; the rueful \\"Adieu, notre petite table\\" by Netrebko and the frothy, joyful \\"Je marche sur tous les chemins\\" in which she celebrates her glamour queen status at the Concourse. I could go on. I love this disc. The only reason for not giving it a perfect score is a slight problem with balance in the audio at times( for ninety percent of the time  the DTSHD 5.1 sounds very good, I hasten to add)and I suppose recording a live performance is always a major challenge for sound engineers. Still it is a small flaw that will not affect your enjoyment of this disc at all. And enjoy it you will.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I loved this movie. I always have the songs from it stuck in my head.
1401923119|4.0|This is a book that I will leave out on my coffee table for easy picking-up, rather than tucking it away in the bookcase.  It is heartening to see a book written by a scientist that explains realistically how your thoughts can and do effect the physical body, with a good amount of humor thrown in.  Yes, not being a scientist myself, I did have a little trouble understanding some of it, but it was well worth skimming over those parts to get to the golden nuggets.  I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for wcientific proof that thoughts can change even the tiniest cells of your body.  A most fascinating read.
B001R0KH3W|4.0|The picture and sound quality is execellent, but as a Stevie Wonder enthusiast, I was a little disappointed with some of the song choices. \\"DO I DO\\"..No he didn't...I would have loved to hear a Beetles version of \\"Loves In Need Of Love Today\\"...oh but the Beetles didn't sing that...neither did Stevie on this UK concert..I'm in need. I saw a version of this concert in DC and Stevie did Stevie, not the Rolling Stones, Beetles, or traditional Jazz tunes ...just R&B Stevie. Overall It's still an excellent concert and a must have for your DVD or Bray collection. How about an encore...WE want PT2...We want PT2... with all StevieW songs.

B001TK3XOA|5.0|After I read Tolle's book, I felt inspired and empowered; I felt more confidence in dealing with the problems one has with everyday relationships.  It IS a difficult book to read, and yes, he's certainly not the only one to explain what an awakening is and how to attain it; however, this book spoke to me.  I do think one has to be open and ready to embrace the concepts of the author's writing; otherwise, it's just another book.  I've passed this book on to friends and family.  I can truly say that Tolle's writings have influenced me and many of my family/friends.  I feel happier, and I know what to do, even though it's tough, and we're all only human, so most of us can't live it every minute of the day.  Still, the awareness of what IS is extremely profound.  It is helpful for everyday living and especially helpful when one is faced with a serious challenge.

044024367X|2.0|I'm a big Jack Reacher fan, awaiting every installation with anticipation.  This one disappoints; not just as a Reacher novel, but as a novel in general.    Lee Child is the master at detail.  As a book is winding taut suspense, he will cut-in with terrific descriptions of the little details in life.  Perhaps how a sugar packet is torn, or how a door hangs askew.  The reader, reading with baited breath for the next action event, has to stop and admire the details.    Unfortunately, in Nothing to Lose, there was not much more than detail.  Every 40 pages or so we were told how many blocks Reacher went west, then north, then west, etc.  Every building, street, vehicle, table and chair were described, as well as every cup of coffee and the mug in which it is served (we do learn that Reacher is a coffee addict/officianado).  It was the only way to fill the pages since the plot was paper thin.  The resolution was very unsatisfying as well since the solution seemed to be devined by Reacher.    This is a Reacher novel to be skipped, and certainly not the one upon which to judge Reacher or Mr. Child's writing skills.  Even Gold Glovers are entitled to an error once in a while.  Skip this one and reread an earlier Child thriller.
B000SQJ2JG|5.0|I have been a Deep Purple fan since high school when I was 13 years old when I bought my first Deep Purple album featuring the wickedly good line-up that featured Turner as the lead singer but produced what that godawful red-headed stepchild REO Speedwagon-Foreigner disgustingly bad rip-off \\" Slaves and Masters \\", that only had the one good track ( The INSANE first track \\" King of Dreams \\" ).  After that I picked up all of their other albums in succession according to the line-ups and of course I started with Mark II, then Mark III, and so on.  When I got to Mark IV I was COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY BY THIS ALBUM FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ALONE:  TOMMY BOLIN.  THE GUY WAS AN INSANE GUITAR PLAYER, especially on tracks like \\" Coming Home \\", \\" Dealer \\", the disco Purple track \\" I Need Love, and \\" You Keep On Movin' \\".  I had never heard a guitarist like him ever in my life and after being a Classic Rock/ Hard Rock/ Metal fan for most of my life I don't think there will ever be one like him again.  If you're a new fan just getting into DP, RUN, DON'T WALK TO BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU CAN FIND IT LOCALLY and then buy some of Bolin's other works, especially his two solo albums \\" Teaser \\" and \\" Private Eyes \\", Tommy Bolin Whips and Roses 1 & 2, and anything else you can get your hands on that's legit Bolin.  Having died of a heroine overdose at the age of 25 we weren't blessed to hear the sounds that this legendary guitarist would have made over the years, and it's a damn shame that most people today haven't heard of him but I think that's more a testament to how narrow-minded people are in their choice of good quality music and see it as just music but for serious fans of any band it's art, and Tommy Bolin's canvas was his guitar.<br />  The album itself is a mixed bag, I do have to say.  Coverdale sounds more mellow and groovy than he did in \\" Burn \\", whereas Burn had slower tempo tracks then this album did ( mostly cos Blackmore's guitar playing didn't have the frenetic energy and flair Bolin was known for ) on this album he and Glenn Hughes are singing in concerto, that is they sound more on the same page on this album then they did on the previous Mark III albums they had made with Blackmore.  This was a really revitalized era for Purple and could have been a kind of Renaissance for them, but by this time Lord had been thinking of quitting the band for a while and almost all of them were hooked on drugs and the rock and roll lifestyle had gotten to them, but not before they entered the studio to record the album!  It's just a fun, fun album if you're more into blues rock and jazz ( the main reason Blackmore quit the band, since he was  having problems with Coverdale and Hughes over their love of what he referred to it as \\" shoeshine \\" music. )<br />  That is where the true problem with this albums lies with true DP fans, and causes the raging debates that you'll hear from all the warring Purple factions.  This album is not DEEP PURPLE MARK II, AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN.  I'm sure most Deep Purple fans would have been happy it the band had changed it's name to reflect something new and didn't have the moniker Deep Purple since most fans have a hard-on for Gillan or Blackmore ( both of whom I love to death but I think of Deep Purple as an institution, not as a band ) but most fans probably don't know that the band was actually founded by Jon Lord and the first musician he approached to join was Blackmore, and that little tidbit has been lost over time and later on Blackmore took over more and more and Lord went along.  The power struggles with Gillan and Blackmore led to the Mark III phase and while most people didn't initially know how to react to Coverdale subbing in for Gillan it was Glenn Hughes who made a more capable and better bass player than Roger Glover, so this thing went on and on until Blackmore finally had enough and founded Rainbow.  This could have marked a new era in Deep Purple's history, but tragically this final,tragic album was their last until the Mark II reformation in 1984.  Bolin breathed new life into Deep Purple just like Steve Morse did in 1996, and his flailing guitar playing and thrashing style should be emulated more today ( IF at all possible, cos NOBODY comes close to playing like this guy, NOBODY. )  For anything else, BUY THIS ALBUM TO HEAR TOMMY BOLIN SLAY YOU WITH HIS GUITAR ELTEE!!!!!!!!!!ragic album was their last until the Mark II reformation in 1984.

B001PPLIFU|1.0|This is the WORST Bond ever! Far below \\"Moonraker\\", \\"View to a Kill\\", \\"Die Another Day\\", or any other all time low! Shame, shame, and, hopefully, a panic red alert for EON Productions, especially after the franchise's brilliant makeover with \\"Casino Royale\\".<br /><br />Ten basic aberrations:<br /><br />1.- Pretentious and incoherent title. The plot lives up to it, unfortunately.<br /><br />2.- No gun barrel opening. Why put it at the end?<br /><br />3.- Horrible song. It's like a tradition now, ever since Tina Turner sang the powerful \\"Goldeneye\\" theme. No fireworks afterwards.<br /><br />4.- Uninteresting girl. A tanned, pouting, undernourished model so limp, Bond doesn't even kiss her, let alone bed her! The bit about her belonging to the \\"Bolivian Secret Service\\" makes for the only (unintentional) joke in the movie.<br /><br />5.- Feeble villains: one is the same French runt who played Pappa's boy in Spielberg's own spy fiasco 'Munich'. The other is just an ugly Hispanic thug in uniform.<br /><br />6.- Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright. Neither made much of an impression in 'Casino Royale'. Why bring them back? Giannini's corny death scene makes the entire audience squirm with embarassment.<br /><br />7.- Horrible locations (except for Siena). Chile and Panama stand for Bolivia and Haiti. I've been in those four countries, and I can tell you there are plenty of plush resorts and beautiful places in each and every one of them. Why just show their ugly slums? India looked lovely in \\"Octopussy\\", Thailand looked fabulous in \\"Man with the Golden Gun\\". Why make the exception with Latin America? What's so exotic about a dump? Who'd want to go there? As for picturesque alpine Austria, all we get is an arty-fartsy opera staged in a scaffold, intercut with some rapid slam-bang-dung. Which take us to number...<br /><br />8.- Convoluted editing. The whole movie looks more like a music clip than a Bond movie. After a while it gets not only tiresome but annoying. At that point all you want is to see the end credits. Even if there is no gun barrel sequence.<br /><br />9.- CGIs. Hate them! EON should avoid them altogether. People expect to see real feats of derring do, made by the world's top stuntmen risking their very lives before the camera. At least in a Bond movie they do. That's an essential part of their appeal. Skip on that and they become standard action flicks. Finally...<br /><br />10.- Hollywood's new PC crapola, paying lip service to Marxists despots like Castro, Aristide, Ch&aacute;vez and Evo, against evil multinational corporations (which conveniently remain nameless or fictional). Has Bond turned out to be Kim Philby? Say it isn't so, James!<br /><br />Last but not least, a<br /><br />P.S.: Why would anyone build a huge minimalist hotel with no swiming pool in the middle of a mountain desert? Why would it blow up in flames all of a sudden, like an oil refinery? No idea. That's what they call them \\"Mistery Movies\\", I guess...<br /><br />*************************************************************<br /><br />Just for the record: Bolivia is a South American country facing many problems. Lack of water isn't one of them. Half the population lives near the immense Lake Titicaca, amid the ever snowed Andes, while the other resides on the banks of the Amazon River. Bolivian deserts are so due to their high altitude, just like those in Tibet. Wherever the Bolivian terrain slopes down, it becomes the Amazon jungle.

B001JNNDGA|5.0|I will say up front that I am a Christian... a devout Christian. Therefore, know my perspective when watching this movie and giving it my review.    I want to address what I hear said by a lot of people, that being the graphic violence portrayed in the movie.    I, like most people, cringe at the thought of those bloody, gory scenes that are in so many movies these days. In fact, I won't watch nor allow in my home a \\"slasher\\" movie. There is pretty graphic violence depicted in this movie, and I can't bring myself to look at it when it is taking place. But I do want to address why I think it should be in the movie.    So many movies have been made over time, and so many paintings have been created, all to recreate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Most often He is depicted as having little-to-no wounds and with a small trickle of blood running down his forehead.    That depiction is so inaccurate. The Bible tells of what happened when He was scourged and history teaches us of how Roman scourging was so horrific.    God took the form of man in order to become the final and eternal blood sacrifice for all sin; past, present and future. Satan, in battling with Jesus, had the most horrific pain imaginable inflicted upon Him. For many people there has been no knowledge nor appreciation of exactly what that entailed. And to be perfectly honest, the scourging depicted in \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\" probably did not go to the full depth of damage inflicted.    This movie is the first that really gives one an idea of just how bad it was. No, it isn't at all pleasant. I can't and won't watch when that part of the movie plays. But the entire time it is happening my mind and my heart are thinking, reflecting on my own life, on the mercy and grace and love of God and a more clear understanding of what really did take place and that it was done for my salvation... and for yours.    I highly recommend this movie.
0205632645|5.0|I picked this up sometime in December, after having read the original edition online for free. I know it has been getting a lot of bad reviews citing greed and whatnot, so I thought I'd add my thoughts on this newest edition of the most useful primer on the craft of writing.<br /><br />In my opinion, the biggest draw of this new edition is the cover. It's black and professional looking; The perfect compliment for your shelf of writing books. I would recommend this edition to anyone willing to spend a little extra for a copy that isn't likely to fall apart after a few dozen reads. Long after you feel you've mastered all there is, you will still find yourself dipping into this now and again as a refresher. The advice is timeless and this high-quality edition does it justice.<br /><br />If you're a student or don't care about a nicely bound hardcover, you could do just fine getting the ~$10 softcover edition.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I once met a trainer who told me that before getting into personal training she never went to a gym. She did all her workouts at home. This rang true for me because unless you want to be a body building champion, workout equipment at gyms is irrelevant for most of us. Since then I began a search for the perfect at home workout that I could substitute a gym membership with. As a busy person, who isn't in New York City?, this perfect workout had to be done in under an hour. I have compiled a pretty good library of short-format workouts spanning strength training to pilates to yoga. Although some of these are excellent and accomplish what they set out to do, they always required additional components in order to achieve full-body balance. What's great about Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred is that you could stick with this as your only workout for a while and achieve a healthy, toned physique. The only thing I do aside from this is yoga and it's because I love it and get benefits beyond the physical from it. But, if you're mostly searching for a complete strength training/cardio/abs combination, you cannot go wrong with this DVD.    (P.S.: this is my first review for an amazon product - ever - I've been purchasing from the site and enjoying other people's reviews since 1997.)

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Most people tend to experience dull and monotonous days on a regular basis. The movie's simple, yet effective premise is that by taking small steps to improve and enrich yourself on a daily basis, one can improve his lifestyle to a degree. Incredible acting by a charming and beautiful cast makes this movie a pleasure to watch over and over again. One of the rare movies where you glean something new everytime you see it.  The script is so tight and carefully thought out that you will marvel how it all final comes together at the end. Wish hollywood made more like these.    Note to detractors:  This movie demands that it be seen multiple times to be appreciated.
0061474347|3.0|Lirael continues the great story and magical structure, but it suffers from things that put Sabriel at a higher standard.  I ended up enjoying Sabriel more and it nearly took me months to finish this episode.  The reason being, is that I just really couldn't keep focus on the new characters.<br /><br />I won't say that the novel is bad, because it's really not.  Lirael has a great story and is generally unpredictable.  Mogget continues to be hilarious as one of our new characters, the Disreputable Dog, compliments the cat very nicely.  Garth Nix is an extremely talented writer, with a knack for creating a whole new fresh world for fantasty fanatics to enjoy.<br /><br />Now wheres the problem?  My problem is that Lirael and Sameth throughout the novel are very dislikable characters.  Sameth seems like he has a huge tendency to become selfish and betray.  He ultimately becomes a hero, but he starts as a real self-loathing, annoying character.  Lirael seems to mimic this personality as well.  She starts as a quiet, depressing, and suicidal individual.  I overall understood the purpose of the personalies, but I didn't find my salvation in anyone, because every character was mean and pessimistic.  With the effect of this and the reduced intensity(action) I read this novel a lot slower than the first book.<br /><br />So in the end, Lirael steps down Nix's ladder a bit, but Nix has a very strong selection.  Shade's Children and the Seventh Tower series really moved me.  Maybe the reason for that was an array of very heroic, admirable characters.  I tend to connect more with stories of outstanding heroism.  Where as Lirael tended to avoid the heroism and save it for the third novel.  I am very confident that Abhorsen will be an excellent novel, but thats because Lirael and Sameth got over their small problems in the huge scope of the novel.  I look forward to reading the next installment, but I am going to keep it real and say the book was good, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as I longed to.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Amazing concert! I gave it as a gift to my mother and she loved it.   The additional CD with songs from the concert was a big plus.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Jennifer Hudson has such a powerful voice. This CD was good it has fast upbeat songs and then it has some slower beat songs. Overall this is an awesome CD.
B00005B534|4.0|Adagio is the vehicle of French guitarist Stephan Forte who according to the handy liner notes seems to have a voracious musical appetite. Apparently there was a demo in '96 called Visions but this is the debut and young Stephan certainly sets out his stall with confidence and not a little flair. Comparing this to other guitar virtuoso projects like Kenziner for example this comes out on top most of the time and IMHO the reasons for this are;<br /><br />Adherence to song based structures. Sure when you are a hot muso you might as well show off a bit however unlike his idol Yngwie Malmsteen young Stephan doesn't feel the need to overplay constantly. Having bandmates for this project of the calibre of Richard Andersson (Majestic) on keyboards, Dirk Bruinenberg (Elegy) on excellent drums and Briton David Readman on vox certainly has aided the overall feel of the thing. Though much of the keyboards for this release were programmed and Andersson merely assisted.<br /><br />Secondly Stephan is truly gifted - to hear some of his Malmsteen inspired runs just listen to In Nominee... or The Stringless Violin. This musicianship (by the way check out the drum work on The Inner Road) has been allowed to shine by Dennis Ward who at this point - 2001 - was starting to really carve his niche.<br /><br />Another good point - tasty graphics, full credits and lyrics and the aforementioned liner notes. And being a debut it has all the energy you often find with a newcomers first outing.<br /><br />Downsides would be the project feel that can sometimes detract from such albums, the somewhat narrow width of composition and self important/pompous lyrical tones that may prove an acquired taste for those not familiar with the mindset of Euro metal. There are more than a few thee/thou/thine sort of words that may give you flashbacks to Shakespeare plays from your school days. Not to mention that 11:40 of The Seven Hands of Sin may be too much prog/shred for all but the most indulgent listeners given there are two bona fide instrumentals on the album anyway.<br /><br />But overall good stuff.instrumentals on the album anyway.

0743277708|5.0|Outside Reading Book Review    Watership Down by Richard Adams is an entrancing, engaging novel that chronicles the adventures of a band of rabbits that, through personification, are given human qualities.     In this novel, there takes place the journey of a band of rabbits, led by Hazel and his brother Fiver who leave their warren because Fiver, who seems to have an inexplicable sixth sense and exceptional instincts and perception, even for a rabbit, feels they are no longer safe there. After seeing a billboard near his warren, Fiver gets an uneasy feeling about the fate of his home and tells his brother that they must gather as many rabbits as they can and leave the warren immediately as he is sure that something horrible will soon occur there. Hazel then proceeds to gather a band of rabbits, comprised of those who believe Fiver and those who are discontent with their place in the hierarchy at the warren and want to leave. The rabbits endure many perilous adventures and eventually are able to form their own warren which right from its formation undergoes many trials.   What I found fascinating about this book was Richard Adams's use of famous quotes and passages from historical works to start off each chapter. The quotes, if interpreted correctly, also help to foreshadow the events to take place in the chapter. Watership Down teaches many lessons and parallels many aspects of the human world teaching the rabbits about the outside world and themselves as well. The novel cultivates the overall themes of the book- leadership, trust and reality. Hazel leads the rabbits through many perilous dangers which lead to his companions' absolute trust in him and Fiver. The book also expresses the nature of reality, showing unfortunate facts such as (as Mr. Jepson would say) \\"power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" and showing the sad fact the although animals kill for food and out of necessity, humans potential for harm is limitless and without compassion or thought. This is shown by the callous way in which the humans bulldoze and kill all the rabbits in a warren without mercy or thought so that they may build their houses. This is expressed by the rabbits with anger, \\"All other Elil (rabbits word for living creatures) do what they have to do and Frith moves them as he moves us. They live on the earth and they need food. Men will never rest till they've spoiled the earth and destroyed the animals\\" It also, however, shows reality in a happier light highlighting the relationship of the rabbits extolling friendship and faith. What were very fascinating to me were the parallels of the warren Hazel and his band run into on their journeys, Efrafa to a totalitarian state, a communist state and an oligargic government; Efrafa is run very differently than other warrens, while many other warrens have a \\"monarchy\\" such as Hazel's home warren which is ruled by the \\"Threarah\\" or Chief Rabbit, or council in control, Efrafa are ruled over by General Woundwort, a rabbit who has fought for his power and maintains peace by absolute control. Woundwort issues strict schedules about when who can feed where and even marks and categorizes the rabbits. He rules using fear, and the same occurs in a totalitarian state where the dictator controls every aspect of the lives of his subjects. It had the same effect that Hitler had upon the German people, the atrocities and evils he committed were minimized, dismissed and covered up, but what he did for the German people was perceived as great, bettering their lives (if you were Arian of course) and making them feel strong and proud of the heritage. This nationalism was also felt by the rabbits of Efrafa who Hazel hears them praise, \\"Did you see his body? No. Did anyone? No. Nothing could kill him. He made rabbits bigger than they've ever been--braver, more skillful, and more cunning. I know we paid for it. Some gave their lives. It was worth it, to feel we were Efrafans.\\" In most other warrens such as Hazel's original home warren, the Chief Rabbit rules with the help of his \\"Ousla\\" or police which help to protect and serve, cultivating the Threarah's  will, or in some other situations, protecting power with force. This parallels an oligarchy or the rule of the communist party in the Soviet Union in the late 1900's, as those in the communist party (which was ruled, along with the rest of Russia, by Stalin) enjoyed special privileges such as being able to shop at different stores.   I thought that this book was extraordinarily well written and the lessons one learns from it are exceedingly important. Watership Down takes the triumphs and troubles of humanity and expresses them from a different point of view, with the result being an award winning novel about what one is truly capable of. I recommend this book to anyone over the age of twelve who appreciates a wonderful story and is able to read between the lines to interpret the true meaning of a work of art such as this. Five stars.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|It's nice to see Woody shooting in an exotic setting, but there's little here of Barcelona proper aside from a brief sampling of Gaudi architecture and a scenic street/alleyway.  Several scenes appear to be of the Rambla, but they are tight shots, not long shots, so one does not have the full effect.  That is not to say that the film is not beautiful.  It is simply not an extended, loving portrait of Barcelona.  That is somewhat surprising, since the film is part 'Americans Abroad' in the sun, getting into romantic situations they would otherwise avoid and part Almodovar, with passionate lovers fondling one another one moment and shooting at one another the next.  The 'Americans Abroad' theme dominates.  Its separate scenes are linked by an ongoing voiceover which I found to be intrusive and inauthentic.  The film comes alive when Penelope Cruz enters, but the film lacks the exquisite script, urgency and momentum that one expects from Almodovar.  Sorry, as Simon Cowell would say, but this was slow, very slow.

B001FBSMF8|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but I'm going to write one about this album.  I consider it one of the greatest albums I've ever heard, and I find it sad to think that many people will overlook it.    At least for me, this album took a few listens for me to \\"get it.\\"  I find the best music often works that way.  But because I respect Cornell so much as an artist (due to his prior solo work and his later work with Soundgarden), I gave the CD a few listens.  In the end, I had a full reversal of my opinion of it, and I personally find this album to be unmatched in its music brilliance in the rock genre, other than by the solo works of Roger Waters.    I saw an interview in which Chris stated that the album is meant to be listened to in its entirety.  I strongly urge any Chris Cornell fan who is tentative about this music to give it a few listens through, beginning to end.  That's the only way it makes sense.    This music is not about Cornell's outstanding vocal ability.  It's not about \\"rocking out.\\"  And it's certainly not dance music.  It's a seriously upsetting and depressing masterpiece that was meticulously assembled.  It's extraordinarily complex, moving, and, for me, life changing.    I wanted to write this review to let people know that, at least to some, this may be one of the greatest albums ever made.  Those who take music very seriously, and especially those who understood what he was doing in Euphoria Morning and Carry On, do yourself a favor and give this album a few very serious listens.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! As a product of the 60's this movie describes the tumultuous times.  With the Beatles music as the background it has the emotion of those times.  I especially like when Jude sings \\"Revolution\\" at the office Lucy is working at.  Using \\"Strawberry Fields\\" to describe the confusion and angst of the times and especially the horror of the Viet Nam War was brilliant in my opinion.    There are certainly some contrived songs like \\"Dear Prudance\\" but even they work.  The singing and acting is brilliant and I fell in love with all the characters.    I am so happy Prudance found her contortionist!    Peace Always,  Sandi (former Flower Child)

B0015OKWL2|1.0|The only reason I wanted to see this movie (thank God I didn't buy it or see it in theaters) is because of DeNiro and Pacino. But they couldn't save this piece of trash, no one could. It is honestly so boring, I kept falling asleep and had to restart it when I woke up at least fifteen times. Finally with 20 minutes left I turned it off and took it back to the video store and asked for a credit.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I ordered this product and it did not look anything like the pictures. He told me to return it USPS. I waited and waited and he would never credit my card. I also had to pay 7.88$ for shipping this item back. I will not order from him again, I would not recommend anyone to order from him. The DVD almost look like fake copies.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|I really liked this movie. I thought it was well acted and did a good job at depicting the era. Some scenes were hard to swallow i.e. the child abuse and the fact that the police department could ever be responsible for such a terrible thing to happen. I just couldn't believe this was based on a true story because it was just so angering what happened to that mother. It was written and directed very nicely and I thought it was a great movie.
B001RFIGQ2|5.0|I have decided I like her voice. Her screams are wonderful. The DVD is as described, and contains a very touching live perf at the Wiltern of \\"Dont Forget\\". In the middle of the song, she throws her hair up over her face. Really cool! She also talks to fans waiting in line at the concert, and they dont even recognize her. Watching the DVD, you find out she is nice and down to earth. Demi: Dont ever change. I for one wont forget you!
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|I must confess that, after \\"half a perfect world\\", I was waiting with a lot of fear the newest album from MP. Really, her first three albums (with garrison included) had been somewhat depressive: from a singer painted as the new Joni Mitchell, everybody could expect more.  Whit this state of mind I have heard this work, and, surprise!! it sounded wery well, varying song by song but in almost all tracks aways at a hogh level.  In conclusion, maybe she will not be like JM, but is actually one of the most intriguing singers.
0385340990|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this book. It was so wonderfully written with so many interesting ccharacters.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|As for Diana's style of singing, she has always had a Shirley Horn influence and it is more evident here.  I wouldn't recommend the CD to anyone other than for dinner background music.  What a shame that JH, JC and AW are blanketed by the string arrangement.  Honestly, I think this album was put together to compete with Stacy Kent but no one can come close to the talent of Stacy Kent.  Put Stacy with JH, JC, AW along with David Newton and Mrs. Kent's husband and you'd easily have an academy award derby winner.  Compare the tune from \\"MY Fair Lady\\", I've Grown Accustomed To His Face and Quiet Nights to Stacy Kent's take on the two and you'll easily be able to decide yourself.  Diana Krall is not a jazz singer and her piano style has changed from her earlier years.  I think Elvis Costello's approach to music has something to do with Diana's music lately - more pop than anything.  As for the upcoming Bossa Nova DVD due out in late May, don't count on it being any better other than the fabulous musicians MS. Krall is able to put together including her percussionist who co-wrote many songs way back with Herb Alpert.  Don't you remember Spanish Flea???  Stacy, please put together another album soon.....
B000MRA5NS|4.0|I hated Pierce Bronson (sp?) as Bond!  Yes he looked the part for the sly/suave secret agent, but I never thought he worked in the action sequences.  He was just downright goofy.    Daniel Craig on the other hand fits both perfectly!  He has a subtle cockyness to him that really works, and his action sequences work.    The acting in this Bond is also far superior to the previous 4 tries.    Definately check this movie out, even if you're not a fan of Bond, but a fan of action movies, you'll really enjoy this!
B001K3JF7K|3.0|Being an avid fan of hers, I eagerly awaited this album.  Also as a long-time lover of Bossa Nova, I was particularly excited.  The album is good because I like her style, but most of the songs are not Bossa Nova in origin.  The songs that ARE Brazilian are so mildly so that one can barely tell.    Verdict:  Buy it if you like Diana, but don't buy it if you expect classic Bossa Nova stylings.
B001E75QGG|2.0|I was honestly really looking forward to this movie, and don't mind the prequel trilogy of Star Wars and thought that it was looked a little too harshly upon.  So I went into this with open arms, and within the first 10 minutes I could tell this wouldn't be anywhere near the quality of the other Indiana Jones movies.    To give you some background, my personal favorite was The Last Crusade.  My least favorite was the Temple of Doom, and it still is.  So if you are ok with this movie better better than Temple, but not as good as the other two, then go for it.    Otherwise, there are some major logic jumps that you have to just take and some wooden acting done my Shia Lebof as well as his mother (forgot her real name).    This series they should have just left alone!

B001PPLIEG|3.0|Quantum of Solace is a frustrating Bond film, which switches between very entertaining to fairly pedestrian at frightening speed. At best, it may be described as uneven. Coming off the backs of one of the best Bond films ever and a wonderful piece of cinema in its own right, namely Casino Royale, the producers and director of QoS make a strange choice to halt the revolution early and instead, produce a fairly standard, sometimes even pedestrian outing for Bond. In that sense, QoS has none of the revolutionary flair, the deft characterization, and the bold styling of its predecessor. And don't let anyone tell you it's being judged harshly because it's being compared to Casino Royale either. Put simply, the film never elevates itself above the level of standard blockbuster actioner. It's major failure is that it doesn't continue the path toward reinvention that the previous installment did, and rather falls back on some well worn cliché's, which is surprising, considering that Marc Forster is the last director I would expect \\"the usual\\" from.     Nearly everything in QoS grates where you crave escape. From it's truncated opening, supposedly taking place one hour after Casino ends, to the horrible song played over the credit sequence, to the maddeningly slim running time, the movie announces itself as almost intended to dissatisfy. In the pre-credits sequence, there's a visceral but much too short car chase somewhat hampered by the hyper-stylized editing, popular with directors who lack confidence. (Although it's implied this happens fairly shortly after the end of CR, Bond is apparently wearing a different suit to the one we see him in at the end of that film.)     Bond himself is a bit of a wreck in the movie. The loss he suffers previously is taking a toll on him. He's drinking more heavily and prone to do more serious damage than his superiors might like. He's angry and upset and self-destructive and, because of Daniel Craig's excellent performance, somewhat sympathetic at times. But these little touches get lost in the \\"by-the-numbers\\" feel of the action sequences, all of which happen too quickly and trail off at the end rather than build to a satisfying climax. It's as if the producers, writers and director together, sat down before the film was written, counted out how many set pieces they intended the film to have, story-boarded and location-scouted them, and then sat down to write the movie. The film is also mean - Bond's treatment of Mathis is shocking and doesn't have the effect the filmmakers may have thought it would. In fact it undermines all their earlier efforts to make Bond sympathetic. The most irritating aspect of the film is the heavy reliance on that annoying and much overused plot-point involving Bond going rogue/losing his licence/being sanctioned by superiors/called back by MI6 or whatever. It's tired and re-tread here to very annoying effect.     By far the movie's biggest weaknesses are the fairly weak plot at it's center, the unfortunately weaker villain involved, and the generally weak third act. The confrontation in the desert is especially deserving of derision as it is so typically summer blockbuster fair/cliché' that it is unforgivable. Third acts of Bond films are usually their Achilles heal, but you can usually tell the bad ones easy - they involve everything blowing up for no discernable reason.      For all this criticism though, QoS should be watched. It's a Bond film, Daniel Craig makes another superb turn, all the other performances are fantastic and there are parts of it that are genuinely thrilling, even if you've seen most of it before. And it's not that the film is very bad, though it is flawed. It's just that the movie's only \\"ok,\\" and nothing more.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I first fell in love with Diana about 11 years ago.  I was walking through a very large electronics store in Sacramento, and her music video \\"Live in Paris\\" was playing somewhere in the store.  I wandered over to a large plasma screen and was entranced by her music.  Since that day, I have purchased every album she has made.    Diana's style of singing on this album isn't her best. The song selection is good, but her performance is sub par.  Her whispery/raspy voice was a disappointing surprise, and quite a departure from the energetic, fun voice that she sang with 10 years ago.    Listening to this album was like hearing that a favorite restaurant has just closed its doors. I am sorry to say that I won't be buying any more Diana Krall albums.

Victims murdered in a way similar to how children play tag, gleefully, laughingly, joyfully playing a game of 'you're it'. Cornwell's novel UNNATURAL EXPOSURE is fast paced, and in some instances hard to follow as it boils in a pot full of gore, forensic science, virtual reality, internet enticements, and a rare disease Scarpetta is exposed to during one of the autopsies. I had to read a few pages twice in order to sort out where Scarpetta was headed, but for the most part it was a good read. I'd certainly recommend it.<br /><br />Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin. A tale of suspense around an accidental discovery by an aging rancher on his land in Oklahoma.

0307265730|5.0|At first sight, Jhumpa Lahiri's latest short story collection, \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" moves on the same ground of her two previous efforts - the Pulitzer prize winning \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" and the novel \\"The Namesake\\". After all, in this new book, she is also dealing with cultural e generational gaps. But, once one digs deeper, the reader can find things that go beyond these.<br /><br />These stories are, in the end, about ties. And we can realize that the same ties that unite some people can be the ones that apart others. Lahiri's major influence is clearly Chekhov, dealing with details to reach bigger results. Sometimes, a small thing is capable of trigging a major reaction - for instance some old photographs in a story called \\"Year's End\\", in which something that has been long kept inside the protagonist's heart comes out in a moment of rage. This scene, as a result, will shape the rest of his life.<br /><br />Lahiri writes about what she knows. The problem her young character faces are probably much the same ones she had to - or knew people who had to. On the other hand, her imagination is so precise - as is her prose - that she can make things up and be totally believable.<br /><br />Each of the stories in the first parte of the book is self-contained. But the second part of the collection must be read in the right order because they add layers to the character and follow them two throughout the years.<br /><br />Since her first book, Lahiri displayed a sure hand to tackle not only the narrative, but also her characters' arc. In \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" this is not different, but we can easily notice a more mature writer. Her style reminds of the great Alice Munro's, in which the shifts and turns of the narrative are totally developed - nothing comes up gratuitous.<br /><br />In the end, the stories leave a sense of loss, but also a note of hope. In the world where Lahiri's characters inhabit, there is not much room for fairy tales' solutions - which is pretty much like our real world. Her last story has a heartbreaking ending, but, at the same time, the assurance that destinies have been filled.ory has a heartbreaking ending, but, at the same time, the assurance that destinies have been filled.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|This is a great movie to watch and enjoy when you just need to sit and have a \\"pick-me-up\\".  The Abba music is wonderful, and Meryl Streep is just terrific in her role. Is there ANY thing she cannot do?  It is a joy and a feel-good movie to watch.

B001GM28HO|3.0|Um.....ok?  I'm a fan of dance music, and although I can find an occasional good song on record here I'm unable to figure out why Lady Gaga is as big as she is.  \\"Just Dance\\" was decent, but I expect more upbeat and faster paced music from a dance artist, especially when her first single is called, well, \\"Just Dance\\" (really, can anyone dance to that song?  Not really, because it's too slow).  \\"Poker Face\\" has, if you've checked, since hit No. 1 on the iTunes singles list, and I'm appalled seeing as I think this song lacks any real melodic hook.  Gaga has unoriginal, unfeeling vocals and her songs are nothing more than dance fluff (the only song I've found with any hint of a memorable melody is \\"Paparazzi\\").  Being a fan of this genre of music, it's hard for me to say this, but The Fame is hardly original and even less entertaining.  Lady Gaga?  Lady Blahblah is more like it!

1582701709|2.0|I read this book, and as I was reading it, I couldn't help it wonder if it was a joke to make people have a good laugh, a conspiracy to fool people, or just something so deep that is beyond my perception. In fact I'm still not sure!  First of all, let me tell you, the book is about 200 pages, when everything it has so say can be well explained in only 20 pages. Most of this book is just repetitive. Most sentences are repeated or rephrased over and over again. Almost 90% of is just redundant.  And as far as the message it has to deliver, I just don't think it that literal. I can see how positive affirmations can help you have a better attitude, but I don't believe it can \\"create things\\" or \\"cure diseases\\".   Funny thing is that the author tries to back up her \\"secret\\" with science (quantum physics) without establishing any real relationship between the two, which can be proven.  All in all, if you are curious and just wanna read the book that's been a bestseller for over 100 weeks and you have some spare time with nothing better to do, read it. But I do not recommend buying it! Just get it from a public library and return it as soon as you get bored with it! Or just contact me and I'll send you my copy, since I'm already stuck with one.
1577314808|5.0|This book rings true. You feel it is written from direct experience, with great sincerity and compassion. The question and answer device it uses is very effective in shedding light on an esoteric subject. In spite of the clarity of the writing, this book will probably only appeal to those who already have some inkling, through their own experience or intuitive sense, of what the author is trying to convey. Otherwise, it could be viewed as so much \\"mumbo jumbo\\". However, for those who do have that inkling, it confirms and validates truths that are deeply felt but difficult to express, in a very convincing way. It is a book to be treasured and re-read.

One day, the Witch of the Wastes come in. Sophie insults her, and in turn, the witch turns Sophie into a crone. Upset by this, she ventures out to the moving castle, which is owned by Howl. Howl is a wizard that is feared in Sophie's town of Ingary due to stories of him capturing pretty young girls and devouring their hearts.<br /><br />After she arrives at the castle, Sophie meets Howl's apprentice, and Calcifer the fire demon. Her and Calcifer make a bargain that if she finds a way to break the contract Howl and Calcifer have, Calcifer will break the spell that is put on Sophie. She agrees, and becomes the cleaning lady for the castle.<br /><br />While in the beginning of the story, Sophie is a relatively boring character, after she's turned into a crone, she becomes very lively and witty. She constantly annoys Howl, and bosses Calcifer around.<br /><br />You soon find out that Howl is not the evil wizard that the town believes him to be. He's a self-absorbed man that throws fits over things like a mix-up of hair dye. Sophie also finds that the door of the castle leads to different places, including modern Wales.<br /><br />Over all, this is a really good book that's full of humor. The reader will fall for Howl, just like Sophie does.
B000CBSHK2|5.0|It took me putting the album on a shelf (figuratively) for quite some time until I had the urge to return to it and allow it to slowly envelope me.  It has not only become my favorite Beth Orton album, but one of my favorite albums, period.    The musical and artistic change did confuse me at first, as it did most people - it just seemed so drastic.  When I was formulating an amazon review in my head years ago, I had a much lesser opinion that drew from the nature-y and very green artwork and lyric content.  Listening to the album then, for me, felt like I was being buried in soil in the afternoon - warm, but also claustrophobic.    Now I no longer view the album like that, but more as a celebration of life, even with its faults.  This is best represented in moments like the drum-shuffling title cut, the bright and groovy \\"Conceived\\", the rollicking \\"Shopping Trolley\\" and \\"Heart Of Soul\\", which must be a blast to clap and sing-along to in concert. She is also lyrically playful and witty as in \\"Heartland Truckstop\\" where she sings, \\"We're all bridge builder's daughters, with incestuous dreams, confidentially speaking all is at it seems.\\"  Another example is in the first words that open up the album when she sings, \\"Worms don't dance, they haven't got the balls.\\"  Her backing band is tightly behind her every move, as on the intense \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\" and the slow-builder \\"Safe In Your Arms\\"; the latter may very well be the best track of the album and gives me goosebumps every time it begins.  Beth also enraptures her listeners with the stark acoustic numbers \\"Absinthe\\", \\"A Place Aside\\" and \\"Feral\\" which are startling in their naked honesty.  All of the tracks rank among her best songs and I never seem to tire of hearing them over and over.  This probably comes unexpectedly from their short length, as well as the album's short playing time over all; just more proof that less can be more to make a very lean product.    The one valid quibble people have about the albumis that on CD is that, although very dynamic in audio range, it is somewhat muffled and quiet.  It has taken me some time to get past this, as I recognize it was obviously mixed to be this way.  I also will admit that, although I am very anti-LP, it does seem to sound the best in that medium, as if that was intentional as well.    The album is an absolute breath of fresh air for Beth's catalog and the exact kind of switch she needed after the very stagnant DAYBREAKER.  Anyone who truly enjoys an artist needs to respect and expect their growth as singer-songwriters, because where's the fun in hearing the same old thing again and again?    I commend you, Beth, and eagerly await your next release; I hope you continue down the same path and explore any musical ground you feel like trudging through.

015206396X|1.0|I don't usually write reviews. But every once in a while I come across a book that makes me want to PUKE and I feel the need to alert the world to it.     I did not like this book.     The main characters were average, and the author has a horrible habbit of over-explaining things in an attempt to make a point sound like its something great.     I aspire to be a writer. I have a draft of my first book written and I have a draft of that same book that I started crafting in the 5th grade. This book reads worse than my 5th grade writing.     Not gonna lie here, every other sentence began with a noun. Like this:    Katsa did this. She then did this. She did this. She did this. The forest looked nice. She felt this.     [...]..     The romance? Could have been good but the writing fails to make it seem anything other than silly.    The action? Poorly written.  The drama? Ha. Hahahaha. Ha. Yeah right.   The intrigue? Nonexistant.   And the end? I threw the book down. The last sentence was cheesy to the point where I wanted to scream.   In fact there are many sentences like that throughout the book.    The plot lacked severely in originality, and so did the description, the dialogue and the names of the world. I know fantasy has become this thing where you have to have Jashra and Goura from Wagga, but if you can't write like Tolkein, most people won't think anything if it Bill and Jane from Fell.     The character names in the story are weak and you can tell she (the author) thought herself clever when she came up with the country names-- well they're not clever. They're lame.     The only thing keeping this book alive is that the \\"grace\\" idea was somewhat interesting. But the cheesiness of everything killed it.     I know this sounds like a lot of ranting, but I have honestly read a TON of books; I think I know my stuff. My range is big too, so don't think me narrow-minded.     So should you read it?  Only if you have absolutely nothing else to do. And skip anything you find boring--trust me, it won't make a difference.    If you're into painfully blunt writing and mediocre plot go ahead: that's your preference.   But if your looking for something more, I would recommened THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzane Collins, which was ultiamately more interesting, funny, and the romance and action and everything was better.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|This film appears to be written and directed with the marketing strategy of appealing to mixed up and angry adolescents in that stage of life where they think the whole world is crazy, absurd, and working against them. It is a science fiction film yet we are given enough background to also think that maybe this is a film about a mentally ill or schizophrenic teenager. The lose ends of the film are eventually resolved, but in a way that appeals to the romantic aspect of adolescents that seeks some dramatic way to change the world.     We are shown a world of dysfunction around Donnie. His mother seems to think discipline is a bad thing and allows her son to curse her out and then sobs around the house in a depression thinking she failed as a mother. His father tries too hard to be a buddy to his son rather that be a strong father. His teachers range from the intellectual, to the weak, to the right wing fascist type. The school principal fires the one teacher that treats the students as intelligent and supports the most outlandish right wing teacher on the faculty. School bullies dominate the school and community. A crazy motivational speaker begins to dominate the community with an evangelical style self-help strategy. All of this Donnie seems to recognize as out of line and yet he also sees things that are definitely not real, and thus whereas he sees through hypocrisy with x-ray vision, he also is plagued with odd hallucinations of a demonic 6 foot sharp toothed rabbit.     Well where does this weirdness lead us? It finally leads to mysterious airplane engines falling from the sky and then to acts of sacrifice and heroism, again appealing to the romantic and idealistic instincts of American youth.     It is an odd film, neither outstanding nor terrible. The film uses the classic strategy for maintaining suspense, which is to withhold information from the audience. Eventually the viewer is given enough information to have the structure of the film come together andfor there to be resolution of all the issues in the plot, or at least the major issues. I don't think many folks over 21 would find this film to rank high however.

0743539133|5.0|If you stacked all the printed works dealing with the life and Presidency of Abraham Lincoln end to end, they'd likely girdle the Earth.  Nevertheless, noted historian Doris Kearns Goodwin has staked out her little piece of turf with this outstanding look at Lincoln through the prism of his diverse Cabinet.<br /><br />Team of Rivals is, as the name suggests, a historical record of Lincoln's rise to power, primarily focused on the 1860 presidential campaign and the Republican politicians he surprisingly bested in that race.  In a move quite unusual for its time, instead of concentrating his power and distributing patronage to his supporters, Lincoln co-opted his rivals by including them in his Civil War Cabinet.<br /><br />Even more so than today, political parties of the period were highly factionalized, especially on the issues of slavery, trade and secession.  That Lincoln was not only able to construct such a cabinet, but to keep it together and use it effectively enough to win the American Civil War is perhaps his most impressive accomplishment.  Virtually every member of his original cabinet underestimated Lincoln's intelligence and political savvy.  Some (most notably War Secretary Edwin Stanton) treated him with utter contempt.  By the time of his death, with the exception of Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase, they all recognized him for his leadership and historical greatness.<br /><br />Even if you've read several Lincoln biographies in the past (as I had), I can still highly recommend this look at the war time Lincoln administration through a slightly different lens.  I purchased this work in an abridged audio format, 10½ hours of audio in eight CDs and was well pleased with the result.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|Let me begin by saying this is a decent film.  It's not BAD, but it's not nearly all it could have been either, and the reason for that is that the makers of the film are falling into the same trap that killed Brosnan's last Bond outing \\"Die Another Day.\\" -- too $@&% much emphasis on very elaborate and very flashy stunts and effects sequences and not enough on the plot and the story.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" was a great film not because it featured the coolest effects and biggest explosions, but because it told a riveting story.  That's also why the first several Connery Bond films were great.  It's distressing to see that after hitting a home run with Craig's first turn as Bond, by getting back to good storytelling, they couldn't see that THAT was why the film worked so well and stick to that approach.  They make it look like they are lost as soon as they don't have Fleming's actual story to work from.<br /><br />At least they left out the science fiction gadgets, but they did give way too much screen time to the elaborate stunt sequences.  If they'd put half as much effort into plotting and story writing it would have been a far better film.

The cd has a Blues-like quality to it with a little of the 1980's mixed in!  I suggest everyone go and buy it because it is a wonderful set of music!
B001TODCII|5.0|The movie deals with a heavy subject and the scum that deals in the sexual exploitation of naive young women.  I loved Liam's character as the devoted father who loves his child above all else but still has a very sharp edge.  The men who took his daughter really had no clue as to the hellstorm they were unleashing and Liam's intensity to save his daughter was like a hot knife slashing through all of Paris to get her.      When his French counterpart asks him if he would go on tearing parts of Paris apart in the pursuit of these men he quickly replies that he would burn Paris to the ground to get his daughter back.  As the father of a beautiful daughter I can understand his rage as well as his reply.  That line resonated with me because I would paint all of Europe red with her captor's blood to get my little girl back.    The movie is fast paced and action oriented with a dark glimpse into the pathetic excuse of human beings who get off owning other human beings and feeding on their misery.    It is an unapologetic action movie that is intense and powerful and I highly recommend it.
B00005MP58|5.0|I want to comment on the quality of this DVD. It is absolutely beautiful when viewed on the right screen. On my laptop screen the scenes did look washed out. However on my new HD Sanyo flat screen TV it was breathtaking.  The DVD player is connected to the TV with an S-video cable. Definitely worth it for anyone tired of their VHS version.
B000B7QCKO|4.0|I didn't realize that this recording was from the 90's; I wanted the new one that just came out in March 2009. This one is good, but make sure you know which recording you want and expect to get!
B000094HMU|5.0|This is truly pucinni's turandot. this is the real thing.  I cannot visualize truandot being performed with any additional grandeur, or display of fine opera on the stage. eva and placido are the ones.  I have seen on stage zeffirellis producition of turandot and it is always super but any production is always compared to this one.  Great opera at any price.
B00000G6H1|5.0|this cd is absolutly fantastic, and I really have enjoyed listening to it. It is of great quality which I have found with all of my purchases at amazon.com. I will continue to order all of the olivia newton john collection until I have all of them music and movies.
0307277887|4.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter comes off as awkward in places, as if the author is still searching for their voice, but the Dexter character is such an original delight that the sometimes-floundering passages are easily ignored.  An inventive and surprisingly quick read, it is easy to see how the book spawned a Showtime series.
B001O2ZW1A|1.0|Dissapointed!  Saw the 5 star reviews and was excited until I heard the confusion and loss for direction!
0545128285|4.0|A little collection of fairy tales from the wizarding world. The fairy tales themselves were okay, charming, not bad not great. I loved reading Dumbledore's part after each story though. How I MISS the Harry Potter series though!! It was pretty bitter sweet. But put something that has to do with Harry Potter in front of me and I will gobble it down with a smile.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Diana Krall has delved again into familiar territory, but not with the passion and improvisation of the past. What happened? After listening to two of three cuts I was angry about my impulsive purchase. I expected a high degree of artistry, execution and musicianship. Her breathy vocals are best left with the likes of Elaine Elias who use it to their advantage, Diana just can't pull that delivery off. I hope she will return to jazzy, playful side we have all loved her for.
0451450523|5.0|The book that is one of my favorite animated movies, ever. I fell in love with it when I was a wee lad.<br />The book has very unique writing. Beagle always uses lightening and thunder as metaphors and descriptives. Beautiful story. It was almost identical to the movie, so I loved it. It was a treat to read it in word form, I very much enjoyed the whole thing. Schmendrick=love.
0142410373|4.0|I missed this book the first time around because I was 10 when it was published and I was a bit precocious and never one to read at my grade level. I wish I hadn't missed it! I'm a big Lemony Snicket fan, and it's easy to see that he's been influenced by Dahl. This is a little dark and violent, but quite enjoyable.  Unfortunately, I enjoyed it more *before* Matilda develops her magical powers, when she was just a really smart child - though Miss Honey's explanation at the end mitigates some of that. I'm looking forward to reading some more of Dahl's works.
0451528018|4.0|I would have NEVER picked up Sherlock Holmes on my own! I'm so glad my English teacher assigned this to read (I wrote my paper on the male only space Doyle created, not megatively or anything). The book was pretty creepy at times, shocking! I was never bored, but then again it was so short. I loved the legend of the hound mystery and all of Holmes' deductions to solve the crime. Good times.
1416550534|3.0|This is one book I bought specifically because of all the five star reviews here.  Sometimes I buy books based on the old cliche \\"because of the cover\\" and sometimes I buy them because I'm familiar with the author.  And then there's those times I'll buy them because so many other readers have recommended them to me.  But then every once in awhile, I'll come upon a book I've never heard of and don't think the cover is all that interesting yet it has all great reviews on Amazon.  Such was the case with The House At Riverton.  I was intrigued and that was enough for me.<br /><br />One hundred pages in, I went back to read all of the reviews again just to make sure I had purchased the right book because, at that point, it wasn't grabbing me. I had just finished watching a few Netflix BBC series all set in the early twenties so I felt my recent connection with this era would surely make me feel right at home at Riverton.  Such was not the case.  While it had all of the requisite elements of a good Gothic story set in Edwardian times.....the old manor house, its wealthy inhabitants, servants who gossip, secrets revealed, the challenge of female emancipation, the war and its sacrificial lambs and the never-ending desire to escape one's past....for some stange reason it just did not resonate with me.<br /><br />I do enjoy novels where an elderly person is reliving their past and the book floats between two places in time.  While this book did this seamlessly, I just never really felt invested enough to care about the residents at Riverton or even to care about the mystery involved therein.<br /><br />Grace is the elderly woman in question, once a lady's maid at the esteemed house and now forced to relive her past as a result of a movie being made of an apparent suicide at the same great house.  During the course of her many years of service, she had seen enough and heard enough to last a lifetime.  She had also been asked to keep many secrets, many of which she'll take to her grave.  Or so it would seem until she begins her life \\"on tape\\" to be given to her grandson. There is one secret here that I wish the author would have expanded upon and it might have given me reason to add another star to this review.  But the secret is left out there without the reader being able to witness what it would have meant to the person involved had they known its truth. I would have to say the last third of the book is much better than the beginning.  It's at this point many of the secrets are revealed but, by that time, this reader was just counting the pages until I was done with it.<br /><br />So suffice it to say I'm in total disagreement with most of the other reviews of this book and that's why I say every book has its day and this day wasn't the day for this book for me.  And, by the way, my rating on this book is really 2 1/2 stars but Amazon doesn't allow that so I rounded up as opposed to down.d seem until she begins her life \\"on tape\\" to be given to her grandson.

B001FOR5XU|4.0|This book wasn't bad. These particular vampires/zombies weren't all that interesting but I did like it. I am legend wasn't scary or fast paced and I felt it could have been longer. I was a bit confused on the new society and 'people' but Matheson was a good writer overall. Haven't seen the movie yet...
B001LYD2K4|5.0|i have been a fan of michael schenker since his days in ufo.i think he is one of hard rock,s finest guitarists,this album is great,from; are you ready to rock thru and including the new live bonus cuts with this album michael had assembled a great band cozy powell from rainbow,paul raymond his buddy from ufo,chris glen and gary barden,its too bad this line up did,nt last longer..anyway if you are a schenker fan grab this cd and play it loud!
B001QB9H1A|4.0|In the first scene, some guys are patrolling the cargo bay of a tanker ship.  They open a container to find an open barrel that is oozing toxic waste.  What would you do?  A: They march right in, to get a closer look.<br /><br />If this kind of \\"logic\\" bothers you, you probably won't appreciate any of the Transporter series--but they are Statham's best movies, although the bank robbery one was pretty good, too.  Lots of silly fun.
B001LYD2JU|4.0|this cd is still great 29 years after it,s release in 1980!michael had just left the scorpions after some of the love drive tour and before that he left ufo as they were mixing the excellent strangers in the night double live master piece album,when in ufo on the obsession tour his flying v was all white..soon after that he created the famous two tone black and white trade mark flying v by the time he was back with the scorpions on the love drive tour...any way this debut album by schenker is chock full of classics such as;armed and ready,cry for the nations,victim of illusion,feels like a good thing and the instrumental into the arena the remastering is very good and the bonus tracks are interesting for the schenker fan this album is a must!
0316168815|1.0|I was very disappointed by The Lovely Bones.  It was a difficult read right to the last page because the storyline just wasn't deep enough to be interesting.  Where many readers couldn't put the book down, I had to force myself to stick with it.  I couldn't connect with any of the characters and often found myself wondering why they were even part of the story.  I assumed they'd play some key role later but alas, they did not - just sort of fell off the radar, only to be vaguely mentioned (if at all) in later chapters.      If this is Ms Sebold's first novel, I have to give her credit.  Writing isn't easy and getting published is even harder - especially a first novel.  Just wish her editor had encouraged her to deepen this story a bit rather than allow it to just skim the surface of a plot that had so much potential.
B001N18HOQ|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good set, however I think a few things are missing from the unplugged show though.  My only real complaint about the set is the fact that on the dvd it only shows Eddie, Stone, Jeff and Mike on the dvd menu, what about Dave Abbruzzese? I kinda thought that was pretty rude, he was an awesome drummer and had a lot of input in the band.  I noticed they also blanked him on the photos contained in rearview mirror (the best of)  Anyway the remix cd was cool and it was awesome to see unplugged on dvd even if it has been cut.
0385340567|4.0|Nothing to Lose was my introduction to Lee Child's work and I liked meeting Jack Reacher for the first time. Child writes well and the story moves along all right, but I had a little trouble believing the main character could possibly be real. Yeah, this is who a lot of us would like to be, at least some of the time, but I don't know anyone who lives this lifestyle. On the other hand, I found vicarious enjoyment in the way Reacher kicked ace, even at six to one odds. Shades of Grasshopper!<br /><br />What I don't understand is the way some critics take Child to task for producing work that is not up to his previous level in the first eleven books in the series. It's almost as if such critics feel the author has set out to disappoint them personally and nothing is further from the truth. As with all of us, some things writers produce are better than others, and honest writers make no bones about this. So why set oneself up for disappointment with unrealistic expectations? Why not appreciate what is there?<br /><br />So it's *** for kick-ace characters and competent writing and * for holding my interest and keeping me awake.
1582701709|5.0|Since being loaned a copy of this book, I've bought dozens for friends who were down and out, had lost their jobs, suffered sickness, financial troubles and all other sorts of problems life can throw. This is about positive thinking, but it carries it further with more detail and how-to than any book I'd ever seen. It is not your regular book in that many authors write all throughout, and their message, help and advice is powerful indeed.     If you will read this and apply its principles in belief, the chances of your living a happier, more productive, fun, and fruitful life are increased many times. It makes you feel good about everything, and it puts you back in control.     I can not place any book above this one. It goes right along with the Bible, and what many very smart men have to say on the subject of how we should think. It is so important to think correctly, and this book is a great help in that.

B000002KB8|5.0|Black Sabbath's self-titled debut album was one of the first heavy metal albums that changed the musical landscape and created a new genre of rock music.  This 1969 album and Led Zepplein's 1968 debut album have heavily influenced the thousands of hard rock and heavy metal bands that have followed over the past four decades.  Every hard rock and heavy metal band owes something to Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />The title track on Black Sabbath, \\"Black Sabbath\\", was unique for its time, with thunderstorm sound effects, a distant tolling bell, and a very slow pace the first half of the song.  The momentum picks up considerably the second half of the song, as it is much faster.  All in all, this track is so dark and evil and has been very influential to many bands over the years.  Ozzy Osbourne's vocals are probably his most sinister sounding in the band's history.  His voice oozes darkness, evil, and dread.  The song \\"Wicked World\\" just plain rocks.  Dark and evil.  \\"The Wizard\\" features harmonica and a great melody and beat.  The whole album is awesome.<br /><br />The album has one of the iconic album covers in history.  I don't think there has ever been an album cover as dark and scary looking as this album's cover.<br /><br />If you want a trailblazing album by the gods of hard rock and heavy metal, then Black Sabbath should be in your collection.  This is one of their best albums.  The music is raw, dark, and powerful.  Get it.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|\\"One of the most unique and noteworthy rock vocalists for over 20 years collaborates with a pop producer.\\" - Sounds disastrous? It's even worse than you'd think.<br /><br />Chris Cornell, former vocalist of Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, and Audioslave, teams up with pop producer Timbaland. The result? A complete trainwreck that ruined Cornell's career.<br /><br />The songwriting and lyrics are extremely repetitive and nonsensical; it's hard to believe that Cornell actually sunk this low. Timbaland's production is completely predictable. Seriously, the guy who produced for Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, 50 Cent, Ashlee Simpson, and many more pop acts, is behind the production. I shouldn't explain more.<br /><br />Congratulations, Chris Cornell. You managed to not only disappoint many fans of your work, but your former roommate, Andrew Wood, is spinning in his grave. If you want a definition of career suicide, this is it.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Many people do not like the new side of Keith Urban but I really think it is amazing how much he has changed over the past few years not only as a songwritter but as in his personal life and people really need to understand Keith writes songs from the heart and is going to record how he is feeling and with songs like \\"Sweet Thing\\",  \\"Why's It Feel So Long\\" and \\"Thank You\\" it really shows Keith in a different state then the \\"Golden Road\\" and \\"Love, Pain & The Whole Crazy Thing\\" years and if they calls for a change of song writting then I am glad to hear it because to me Keith writes the best songs with the help of Monty Powell they always turn out just amazing!    KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK KEITH!
0596101996|4.0|I've been using the JavaScript 1.1 version of this book by David Flanagan for years, but it was becoming less and less useful to me as I increasingly needed to look up new additions to the language that were missing from the older 1.1 book.<br /><br />I took the plunge and purchased the new 5th edition of the book.  Flanagan still only provides mediocre examples, like when he explains parseInt() he only shows integer arguments so it's no big surprise that he gets back integers.  It would be much better, say, if he showed how parseInt(2.5) returns 2 so it really can't be used to validate that the input argument is an integer.<br /><br />My boss has the \\"JavaScript Bible 6th Edition\\" by Goodman, but that book merely teaches the language, if you have that kind of time.  You can't really look things up in that book.  Where this book by Flanagan excels is in its reference, but I hate the new arrangement.  Flanagan provided an A to Z reference in the 1.1 book, but not any more.<br /><br />I nicked this review down a star because Flanagan now groups content in the reference by whether it applies to what he calls \\"core JavaScript\\" vs. \\"client JavaScript\\".  Who cares?  Speaking as a developer who jumps among multiple languages -- JavaScript, CSS, DHTML, HTML, LotusScript, @formula language, Java -- to support several web applications, when I need to look something up in JavaScript, I just want an alphabetical reference.<br /><br />I don't really care if something is \\"DOM Level 1 Core JavaScript\\".  I don't even know what the heck that means!  I'm not a JavaScript purist.  JavaScript is just one of the tools I employ.  Flanagan needs to realize that his technical books are not novels, we don't read them from start to finish.<br /><br />Despite my frustrations with the book, it's still a worthwhile purchase, I don't regret it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michaels 30 day shred is INTENSE!!!!!!!  I consider myself to be very in-shape.  My workouts before starting these videos consisted of running about 4 miles a day on a treadmill.  I bought the videos because there are 3 short videos that I thought I would do on an \\"off\\" day when I didn't have much time.  WOW!!!  I was not prepared for the intense workout that insued!  I was sweating my a$$ off in the first 10 minutes.  I thought I was ready for the 2nd level right off the bat--I quickly retreated to the 1st level.  Great workout would recommend to anyone!! There is a beginner and advance person working out in each level, so you can follow which ever is your level.
0609610570|4.0|This book takes practical advice to a new level above the obvious and not going into abstracts without making it executable! I love this book.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite read in the past 12 months. I loved the characters in this book, so much so that when I finished reading it, I missed them. A lot. And I mourned the one character I never got to meet. I felt as if I'd lost the best friend I never got to have. Sorry, I don't know how else to describe it.<br /><br />The title may be long and hard to remember. Remember it however you can. Do not miss this wonderful novel.
B00009QG73|5.0|Outstanding video. Well constructed with good coverage of all musicians.  The band is packed with talent and they play most of their big hits.  I really didn't know what great talent they had in this bad until I rented this video.  Had to buy it once I saw it.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|Seven Lives Many Faces album is different from the others, but in a progressive way.  I needed some time listening to the different pieces over and over.  There is a fine thread that continues in this album that begins with the first one.  Everyone should have the entire collection to experience and enjoy all Enigma has to offer...Can't wait for the next CD.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|THIS IS KEITH URBAN'S BEST CD YET! ANOTHER FABULOUS WORK BY SUCH AN AMAZING ARTIST. EVERY SONG IS HAPPY AND LOVING AND UPLIFTING, AND WICKED AWESOME!! <3
B000687M48|5.0|The DVD contains 14 songs, filmed at a concert in Paris, France. Amy Lee (An Arkansas Native), is great, and so is her band. This is an excellent concert DVD. The line-up on this DVD/CD Combo include: Amy Lee on lead vocals, Rocky Gray on drums, John LeCompt on guitar, Terry Balsamo on guitar, and William Boyd on bass.    You get 14 songs as follows: \\"Haunted\\", \\"Going Under\\", \\"Taking over Me\\", \\"Everybody's Fool\\", \\"Thoughless\\", \\"My Last Breath\\", \\"Farther Away\\",  \\"Missing\\", \\"Breate no More\\", \\"My Immortal\\", \\"BRING ME TO LIFE\\" (a HUGE HIT FROM 2003), \\"Tourniquet\\", \\"Imaginary\\" and \\"Whisper\\".    You get extensive bonus material also, which includes the band \\"trashing\\" a hotel room. Plus, you bonus videos of some of their songs. Overall, it is a great concert DVD/CD Combo, well worth having. Thanks!!!!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this soundtrack. It has introduced me to many new groups that I never had heard of. I listen to it every day and I also think that the movie was very well done. I mean, really, we all know that no movie is just like the book. Want the book version? Read the book. Love the movie for what it is.
B000I9S64U|4.0|I didn't mean to order this in the format I did but I'm sure that it will be nice to have it on the computer.  Love the movie and I've always wanted it.

B001GM28HO|5.0|As a 37 year old dad, I'm not the target audience, but have not stopped listening to this CD since I bought it.    I haven't enjoyed a CD from beginning to end this much since Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\".  You'd think this album came from a confident veteran rather than a debut.  Pretty impressed to learn she wrote songs and played instruments as well.    Track #2 LoveGame is a standout.  The heavy synths and beat make up for the silly \\"disco stick\\" lyric.  It is best heard driving at night on your car stereo.      As others have said, if you like Gwen Stefani, you'll like this.   So nice to have a new star on the scene. She seems like more than a one-hit wonder.
B001MW0J2O|5.0|Cars carrying The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd with Syd Barrett, Pere Ubu and Boards of Canada collide at an intersection and accidently exhange band members One carload stops to get stoned at Syd Barrett's house. Syd attempts to put his vinyl copy of \\"Endless Summer\\", only to discover it has melted in the sun, and fused with his copy of \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\". He plays it anyway. Everyone goes in the studio next door, where the drummer passes out from too much wine and is replaced by a drum machine, calliope, and retro synths submersed in an endless ocean of reverb. Everything gets too much Digital signal processing and is slowed down by half speed, after which the Beach Boys lay down vocals.        Truely great and will be remembered as a classic. Both totally pop, and totally wierd at the same time. Track densities approach \\"King's Lead Hat\\" by Eno in some cases, and if you like textures, this is for you. Nice package too.
0345440927|2.0|Be prepared for the guilt to be layed on while you read this book. I understood the advice Hogg is trying to give to the reader, but I didn't appreciate the way its written and how she comes accross. The author's voice has this sort of all-knowing, all-seeing judgemental grandmothery tone to it. For instance, she likes giving examples by saying At play group, I couldn't help but notice how Taras Mom did such and such, while David's mom did this. David's Mom is doing it all wrong and needs my help. It comes off as condescending and quite a few times after putting it down I started to feel like I was really doing this mothering thing wrong! One of the examples she even gave was of a mother whose overly involved in her child at playgroup, and does everything wrong. One of the many things she does wrong is she even (shock) \\"forgets\\" to bring a snack and is embarrased! It just so happened that I forgot to bring snacks to my sons playgroup the same day I read this... I couldn't help but think what a load of crap. Am I really supposed to be that embarrased that I had to ask my friends to share their cheerios? Thats pretty much what the writer is saying. I found this book to be wordy As mothers get enough guilt and fear every day of our lives from various medias. Enough already.    I also found her to be a bit sexits and old fashioned. She encourages Fathers to be involved in their children's lives, and gives some examples.  \\"Quinn's Dad\\" takes his son (reluctantly at first) to the park for an hour every Saturday. Of course, she says, hes a big Lakers fan, so he schedules the trips very early so he doesn't cut into game time, god forbid. \\"Still\\" the author writes, \\"it gives his wife a big break.\\" Oh, thank you so much dear husband for scheduling an hour of playtime with your child at the crack of dawn! What would I do without my hour of freedom on Saturday?  She says the reluctance for fathers to be with their toddlers and to schedule it around their own priorites is perfectly normal and acceptable- \\"many fathers are like this\\" she says. Ok that is just dumb and sexist. Sure, both mothers and fathers get weary of caring for their high energy kids. But a reluctant father that spends 1 hour of his week with his son and then goes back to his Real Life (the game) shouldn't be preceived as normal and acceptable. That is sad.    Most of the advice in this book is on point, but I hated the way it was written. I also hated the cover. Very waspy. Those kids aren't even related to the author.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This is apparently a difficult recording for some to get - considering the negative reviews.  It is personal, quiet, all those things - but it drips with emotion.  In many ways, this is Diana Krall's most obvious tribute to her mentors - London and Lee especially.  Even the album cover recalls the heyday of the great torch singers - a pantheon in which Krall belongs herself.  This may not be quite as accessible or obvious as some of her earlier works, but it will repay the careful listener.
B00000DHTF|4.0|I purchased this set when it was released in '98 and listened to it a couple of times, liked it, and then didn't listen to it again until April of 2009.<br /><br />Maybe I have too many c.d.'s, or possibly my 4 kids diverted my attention, but I can't believe I'd forgotten how good this collection is.<br /><br />It's difficult to summarize a 66 track set, but from '72 through '95 Springsteen's artistic powers were such that even the unreleased material exemplified here is uniformly excellent and only comparable to the first volumes of the Dylan Bootleg series.  This boxed set is truly a stunning achievement.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|Yep.  My Morning Jacket keeps popping up everywhere.  The lead singer's vocals are a twin to Jimmy James' sound.  My honest first impressions are that this band is what My Morning Jacket should have matured into but instead My Morning Jacket devolved into something extremely awful from \\"Z\\" and on.  Any fan of My Morning Jacket's earlier, more indie sound will absolutely love Fleet Foxes.  They fill that aching hole with what My Morning Jacket should have.  The mix of folky, acoustic guitar, with hints of haunting gospel in beautiful, emotive, vocals, well, it all adds up to a unique, mature sound early on in their career.  Let's just hope they don't follow My Morning Jacket's bad example and get worse with time instead of better.

0452289963|5.0|This was a difficult read, Tolle is SO PROFOUND in this book, but it definitely makes  you look inside of yourself and think very differently of the world around you and what part you play in society. Definitely a good read!
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This cd, the latest release from Keith Urban, is absolutely excellent. I have all of his cds but this one has got to be his best work yet. The music is wonderful with tunes and vibes of country yet a little rock. There are some songs that tug at your heart such as \\"Thank you\\" which he dedicates to Nicole; others are just great uplifting songs. The whole feel of this album is light and just a good feel. WHEN you buy it you will agree it is one of his best works of art and talent, as well as you won't be disappointed. Enjoy this wonderful artist we are blessed to hear.

B001K3JF7K|5.0|Maybe it is a matter of taste, but I do love it. Appropriate title - it is perfect for chill nights. I can see this being a nice album for the winter months in by the fire.  There is a time a place for all kinds of music, and this album fits in well - when you need it.  Good job Diana - I look forward to your show in Baltimore in June.
B001EO2UJK|2.0|...all that was sublime, articulate and pleasant about these recordings evident on any/all previous pressings (CD or vinyl) has been lost.  Someone should have had the foresight re-present the original mixes for the fans and to archive the original quality--delicate, raw in places but highly intentioned/best they could do for their day--for generations to come.    So much effort went into these gnarley and smashed together mixes, that I feel my money would have been better spent finding good pressings of and paying top-dollar for these albums on vinyl.  I think most time was spent on the 5.1 mix and then a computer decided what the stereo mix should be.  This leaves the vocals sitting in your lap and everything sounding like a bunch of instruments squashed together, resembling a mass of uncoordinated sound instead of what was once a nice 'tune'.       I have waited almost a decade for this box set to arrive...Let me assure you, I was not let down by my own high expectation, I was dismayed to find songs that I know and love have been replaced by sharp, rough and crushed boxy replicas.      I wish we as fans could vote.  I think it'd be great if we could get Mobile Fidelity to give the original Genesis masters their usual high quality treatment.  I would gladly pay for the whole Genesis canon again for like the 4th or 5th time if these songs were given the respect they deserve.
0956010903|5.0|I have the collector's edition and am I glad I bought it when I did. I see it's sold out. This book takes the reader into an imaginary world created by none other than the queen of fantasy J.K.Rowling. I have to say I totally loved the read and will read it again and again. Bravo!
B001PPF130|5.0|Odds are that if you are looking at this collector's edition, you are familiar with Radiohead's Legendary Album, OK Computer.  In fact, odds are that most people are familiar with the album, so I'm not really going to talk about disk one.<br />This Collector's Edition is really about three things (other then the original album): The box-style packaging, the bonus cd, and the DVD.<br />The packaging is cool because it doesn't use any plastic.  I think it's great to see more and more cds in environmentally friendly cases, it's a good trend.  The postcards are irrelevant because they aren't really good for anything, but it's a mildly nice touch.<br />The second disk is where this edition really shines.  It is a collection of B-Sides and live recordings from the OK Computer Singles.  Worth the whole set alone in my opinion.<br />The DVD is, unfortunately, a little disappointing. There are three Music Videos and three Live Recordings of a total of four songs.  I would have appreciated a little more variety, but what is included is fun to watch: Deranged in the way only Radiohead can be.<br />Still interested?  Good, I don't regret purchasing this box set for a minute!  It's a good addition to any fans collection, or a great place to start if you don't already own OK Computer.

0380730405|5.0|With only the title and cover in mind, Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca could easily be mistaken for a sappy romance novel filled with love triangles, beautiful women, and implausible scenarios. Fortunately, it is not. Beginning with the first line, \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\" (1), you become a captive of this magnificent piece of literature, captivated by its suspense, romance, and intrigue as we follow a young woman battle the past to make herself known in her own home.<br />Set on the Cornish coast in England in the 1920's, the novel revolves around Manderley, the beautiful, isolated estate of Mr. Maxim de Winter. Our narrator, whose first name is unknown throughout the novel, meets and quickly marries the recently widowed Mr. de Winter.  When they arrive at Manderley after their honeymoon, the young bride becomes consumed by the apparently unforgettable life of the late first Mrs. de Winter, the stunning Rebecca. Although she has been dead for over a year, nothing at Manderley has been altered. Much of the estate remains exactly as it has been since the night she mysteriously disappeared into the clutches of the sea. While the second Mrs. de Winter tries her best to acclimate to this new, proper world, having been only a companion to a wealthy woman traveling in France, she finds herself constantly comparing herself to Rebecca, self-conscious and timid beneath the searing eyes of Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's personal maid who still runs Manderley and is constantly making her feel like an intruder in her own home.<br />\\"Something, in the expression of her face, gave me a feeling of unrest, and even when she had stepped back, and taken her place amongst the rest [of the servants], I could see that black figure standing out alone, individual and apart, and for all her silence I knew her eye to be upon me.\\" (67)<br />The second Mrs. de Winter becomes a slave to Rebecca, terrified of disturbing the spirit who still controls Manderley.<br />\\"She was inthe house still as Mrs. Danvers had said, she was in that room in the west wing, she was in the library, in the morning-room, in the gallery above the hall. Even in the little flower-room, where her mackintosh still hung. And in the garden, and in the woods, and down in the stone cottage on the beach. Her footsteps sounded in the corridors, her scent lingered on the stairs. The servants obeyed her orders still, the food we ate was the food she liked. Her favourite flowers filled the rooms. Her clothes were in the wardrobes in her room, her brushes were on the table, her shoes beneath the chair, her nightdress on her bed. Rebecca was still the mistress of Manderley.\\" (233)<br />As the novel progresses and the second Mrs. de Winter begins to resent the world she is trapped within, Rebecca's, she digs deeper into the secrets of Manderley and the real fate of the first Mrs. de Winter.<br /> There is no doubt that Rebecca is a masterpiece. Daphne du Maurier's writing caresses the tongue as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony caresses one's ears. Its chilling plot, vivid characters, and superb descriptions draw you into Manderley's immense halls, and you feel as though you are by the second Mrs. de Winter's side as she uncovers the secrets of Manderley and its former mistress - secrets that were never supposed to surface again. Although the very beginning of the novel was a little slow, the plot quickly thickens and you become completely enthralled.  Filled with brilliant language, stirring emotion, and nearly unbearable suspense, Rebecca is sure to have you wide awake into the wee hours of morning. I would highly recommend this novel, without any reservations, to anyone in search of an intriguing classic that can be read dozens of times without ever becoming old.
B0000793ZC|5.0|This album (to my mind) further established Simple Minds   as not just another one hit wonder band from a successful   movie soundtrack! With this album, I was able to delve deeper   into the best of their earlier works   (mainly \\"New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84)\\"/\\"Sparkle In The Rain\\")  and absorb what they were all about artistically.   Here are LIVE & re-worked versions of some of their best songs  up to this point in 1987 when they were enjoying worldwide success  with the multi-platinum \\"Once Upon A Time\\" and the worldwide   number one hit, \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\"!!  The gems of this set are their live renditions of their songs like:   \\"Oh Jungleland\\", \\"Promised You A Miracle\\", \\"Book Of Brilliant Things\\",   \\"Once Upon A Time\\", \\"Sanctify Yourself\\", \\"Alive & Kickin'\\",   \\"New Gold Dream\\" \\"East At Easter\\" and last but definitely   not least,  \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\"!!   Too Bad they didn't include a live version of   \\"All The Things She Said\\" on here since this was actually   from the world tour of \\"Once Upon A Time\\"    and that song was well recieved at the time.   I never got to see these guys live, but this is the   next best thing!--Buy It!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I tried 30 Day Shred thinking it would be like other workout videos--you quickly progress through level 1, intermediate is a breeze, and soon it becomes that workout you do every now and then on the advanced level.  Not so with Jillian Michaels!    I consider myself a pretty athletic person (running, biking, and lifting weights several times a week), but level 1 of Jillian's workout kicked my butt!  Literally.  After a week, I have finally managed to bump up to level 2.    Perhaps the best thing, though, is her encouragement.  She knows when you feel like quitting, and that's precisely when she looks right in the camera and says \\"Don't stop now.  I know you want to turn this DVD off, but you'll never get the body you've always wanted without some work.\\"  She's inspiring, and with this video, I know I'm on my way to getting fit.  If you're thinking about buying it, go ahead and spend the $8.50.  It's worth every penny.

B000803CU2|5.0|Though I had been a fan of the then 24 yr old (in 1982)   genius out of Minneapolis named Prince since his debut   (For You) in the spring of 1978, he was only a marginal   cult figure at this time, who was eeking out his own way   between Funk/R&B and Pop/Rock with those first 4 albums   before this one was released in the fall of '82!  To say it was a breakthrough into the wider world of early   80's pop is a gross understatement!    \\"Dirty Mind\\", released in fall 1980, had already served notice   to the world that this mysterious kid was different and out   to raise much hell in the music business in the coming decade!   That was his \\"Rubber Soul\\" album.  1981's \\"Controversy\\" basically exbounded on it's predecessors   premise and was basically his \\"Revolver\\"!!  But \\"1999\\" was a whole other animal to the music listener of 1982..  it was innovative, imaginative, and rocked like a mofo   and was DEFINITELY FUNKY!!  There was a new wave-meets-funk-meets-rock-meets-soul thing   about this album that appealed to a wide fan base and was a   master stroke of brilliance in setting up the creative   zenith of 1984's iconic \\"Purple Rain\\", which would seal   his place in music history in blood!  He had already used the mystery about his racial makeup,   sexuality, artistic direction and general mercurialness to   his advantage to draw the listeners into his music, and his   live performances during this period were in a class all by themselves!     Speaking from the perspective of a fan and a young man of 18   at the time this was released and in the military, I can tell   you that Prince Rogers Nelson was definitely the avant garde   move in 1982/83!!--Cutting Edge Party Mofo 2 The Max!!  I used to carry around one of those mammoth boom-boxes with   all the flashing knobs & lights at that time, and in the   evenings after we had done all of our Army stuff,   it was our time, and we used to hang out and get smashed   and jam to the hot music of the day!  \\"1999\\" and all of it's jams got heavy rotation on our playlists!  There was the now anthemic title track with it's futuristic sound   and message to party like it's all gonna be over tommorow!   And Prince's forays & experimentation with the Linn-9000   drum machine, which he began on \\"Controversy\\" had began   in earnest, dominating his work for the next 4 to 5 years!  The sounds he got out that thing was amazing!   Then there was another classic...\\"Little Red Corvette\\",  which became an instant pop-rock classic!--Moving on to the  punk-new wave-retro sounds of \\"Delirious\\" and \\"Let's Pretend   We're Married\\" which both were fan favorites.   Then there was the scorching party anthem D.M.S.R.   (Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!!) which defined a wild  & still pre-aids epidemic mass of Gen Xers like myself   and what we were all about! ( Cooo-Coooooo!!)  Next came the tranquil & patriotic rockish \\"Free\\",   which I still love to this day!   Other faves of mine that came from this album which still   hold up are: The sparse, quirky & original tracks   \\"Something In The Water (Does Not Compute) & \\"Automatic\\",   the long-playing but never boring stanky-funk of   \\"Lady Cab Driver\\", the weird & kinda funny   \\"All The Critics Love U In New York\\" to the lush, soulful   and sexy \\"hump opus\\" called \\"International Lover\\",   where Prince uses all of his musical, lyrical, vocal   and charismatic charms to the max on this track!   During the live \\"1999 Tour\\" which included his then new   protegees \\"The Time\\" and \\"Vanity 6\\", Prince would end his set   with this song, rising up through the stage floor on a   huge brass bed and sending the fans into a frenzy!!  A true showman for the ages!    This album was a triple platinum tour-de-force in it's time,  opening Prince's musical genius to a whole new audience and  sounding the trumpet for his 80's pop chart domination!  It was badass then, and it's still badass over 25 yrs later!  Buy This CD 4 Sure!!
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Sorry for this title...but I loooved Diana till this cd.  It sounds too husky, and in my opinion this has nothing to do with singing. She can do better than this.   I'm very dissapointed. But these arrangements...WOW!!! (5 stars for Mr. Ogerman!!)

B00003CXCW|5.0|Some of the situations depicted in classic film are charmingly dated, like the car the main character is trying to save at start of film. The look of early Los Angeles. Some of the lines of film are unforgettable. \\"...the crazy '20s.\\" Who ever mentions life of wealth in the 1920s today? Also, kind of funny, but scary, too, how the main \\"star\\" of the film is viewed by other characters in story as \\"old\\" and washed up. But today, she honestly looks good. Even in old movie, you can't believe the character was depicted as a Hollywood retiree at such a young age. Things are easier for women these days, truly.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|Such a disappointment.  Her voice barely has any musical tone... which the producers tried to coverup with an orchestra.  Sounds like she has been smoking too much.
0439023483|5.0|This was one of the most engaging books I've read in a long time. I literally could not put it down - was planning to read 15 minutes before bed and instead read until 2 in the morning.     The plot twists and turns, the characters are like-able AND believable, it's intense, it's violent, it's thought provoking, it might make you cry, it will definitely have you at the edge of our seat... it's brilliant. You must read this one!
B000YAA68C|2.0|This movie kind of seems to hate women. From the neurotic main character, the crass best friend, to the unreasonable but ultimately loving mom, all the women in this movie are really hard to relate to. The men on the other hand are all handsome, kind and insightful with token superficial flaws. They try to imply complex relationships but in the arguments I always end up siding with the guys because the women \\"don't know what they want\\" (as stated by female protagonist). I have to admit, it was genius giving the new love interest turrets so it wouldn't be socially unacceptable for him to move in on a widow. Though I love Nellie McKay, my girlfriend observed that it seemed like she was making fun of the movie. There were a lot weak rom-com cliches, and contrived drama when I was hoping for a movie that had the worst and best moments love has to offer. I feel like this movie at it's core had a lot of potential but it was just poorly executed.

0440244870|5.0|Rebecca Bloomwood, is a 25 year Financial journalist,whose boss seems to appreciate her exuberant personality and often sends her to cover important press conferences all over London.   She also rubs shoulders with the most fabulous A - list friends, living in this spectacular flat in London's trendiest neighborhood (Her boss would kill to live in her building,But HE can't afford it.)Her blue collar parents are so proud that she is done so well for herself, Her friends and colleagues are green with envy.  Oh, If they only knew.  The only problem is her so called life is nothing more than one big fat sham.  Although she loves her job, she doesn't really make all that much, and her friends are all buying houses and getting married and moving up in the world.   Poor Becky can't even get her current boyfriend to have sex with her, no matter what she does to try to pique his interests.  She is literally wallowing in debt trying to keep up with all of her friends( who can truly afford this lifestyle) To top it all off,Rebecca is stalked by creditors night and day, and is terrified of answering the phone.   Sometimes when she has had a really bad day, she dumps all the mail that looks like bills into the sewer drain or someone else's dumpster and forgets all about it.    Whenever she gets down about all these things, she goes shopping.  For clothes mostly, and what a wardrobe she has. I listened to the book on tape and that was half the fun of this book, hearing the narrator  bring life to the high fashion designer clothes Becky buys and her rationalizations on why she needs them.     My favorite scene in the book is where Becky falls in love, with a silk blue scarf with this enormous price tag that she just can't live without. She can't find her credit card and she is completely broke so she begs people at the financial conference she is covering  for money under the pretense that she has a sick Aunt Ermentrude dying in the hospital who just has to have this scarf.    Oneof the speakers at the conference, a very successful Financier,by the name of Luke, overhears all this and gives her the money for it. Becky is so happy until she runs into him and she is wearing Aunt Ermentrude's scarf.  I adore this book, because I think a lot of people can relate to Becky's want to fit in,even it means ruining your credit for years ,and even decades to come.   A lot of people on here classify her as an idiot.   I thought she was a very charming ,smart young woman ,who turns into huge little girl whenever she happens to end up in the mall.( I don't quite get this way with clothes, but put me in a good restaurant or a bookstore and I am a goner.)The only really bad thing I can say is Sofia Kinsella writes in British English. What I mean by this is ,she uses a lot of English slang . She also writes everything in English currency,which makes it hard  to understand if your aren't from Great Britian.  Here are a couple of basic definitions   pound is a dollar and fifty cents  quid is slang for a dollar,   loo is the toilet   p----d means drunk   Knackered means exhausted    If you really like stories with happy endings and lots of belly laughs and silly heroine,please give it a try.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|As a professional in the \\"biz,\\" I'm pretty picky when I watch a movie.  More often than not, I notice problems in the screenplay, the direction seems clunky, or something else just doesn't work.  The price of doing it for a living.  THE LIVES OF OTHERS is one of a handful films that I've seen in the least ten years (as in counted on one hand) that seem nearly perfect.  A beautiful screenplay, terrific direction, true and mesmerizing acting, incredible cinematography where the light is a character in the movie, outstanding set decoration with vivid, dream-like scenes through a limited color palette, amazingly well researched (my mom grew up in East Berlin - I know), and a beautifully moving story about the tug of war between art and the forces of political repression - a story that resonates far beyond the world of the Stasi, the East German secret police.

B001PPLIEG|5.0|This feature in the series of the extraordinary creation by Ian Fleming is nothing less than a great advancement in cementing the future in both the hearts and culture of this next generation. As the official review in Amazon states, this movie is great continuation of Casino Royale. It is foolish to attempt to understand and appreciate Quantum of Solace without placing it in the proper context of the Bond series.     Quantum of Solace allows the viewer to develop an intimate relationship with the character, building on past experiences from Monte Carlo, and preparing the viewer for the true unveiling of James Bond when his character fully matures. These two initial chapters in the Daniel Craig epoch have been a delightful introduction into what is becoming the 21st century standard for Bond.     FIVE STARS
0618918248|4.0|Richard Dawkins has a bone to pick with religion, and in \\"The God Delusion\\" he spares no remonstrance in dismantling just about every counter-argument to unsupportable belief systems, focusing mostly on Christianity and Islam. The book is wordy, over-argued almost to the point of its own zealotry, the key distinction being that Dawkins' arguments, as opposed to those of religious zealots, can mostly be backed up with observation and experimentation.<br /><br />Many of Dawkins' arguments will make complete sense to those with any reasonable scientific education, education at the public school level, not necessarily more advanced; and if there is one adamant theme steering its way through the book it is this: Society allows the corruption of the scientific education of its young people at its peril. Dawkins attacks religious faith, even casual religious faith, for being the enabler of the irrational religious fundamentalism that seems historically to lead to violence and deprivation. This is not a view I would have held prior to reading this book, but Dawkins' arguments give cause for thought. The live and let live supplication to religious faith does seem to bear out Dawkins' conviction that belief systems are thereby able to perpetuate themselves in the face of clear contradiction, yet I would not know how to achieve an alternative. Were all unsupportable belief systems to be stamped out tomorrow, you can bet that within a short time new ones would arise. Why? Some peculiar wiring in the neo cortex no doubt.<br /><br />Dawkins spends many pages trying to theorize how unsupportable belief systems arose in the first place, exploring everything from memes to social hierarchies. But I suspect the answer is really quite simple: Once, one or two hundred thousand years ago, an ancient Homo sapien, perhaps the first Einstein, awoke below a vast savannah sky, mumbled his version of cogito ergo sum, and then thought, \\"Oh heck, I'm going to die someday!\\" And he has been afraid ever since, grasping at anything that would allay the fear.<br /><br />In the here and now, though, science has brought us to a point where our species can control the fundamental forces of nature. This is not a place where ignorance can be safely or rationally tolerated in society, but there is only one mechanism that can deflect the danger: the proper scientific education of young people. Religious zealots push back against natural selection and geology, but I notice that (with just a few exceptions) they have no qualms with internal combustion, heavier-than-air travel, antibiotics or the polio vaccine. It must be a peculiar way to live, unable to square one's religious beliefs with the advancement of human knowledge. \\"The God Delusion\\" is not going to change the minds of the indoctrinated, but if the reader can look past its wordiness and clumsy structure, there are valuable insights throughout the book.sping at anything that would allay the fear.

B001FB4W0W|3.0|This is a decent show, my husband and I enjoyed it when it first came out, but I hadn't read the books yet. Well, I have to say that the books out rank the show by far. I am addicted to the books and I am only on the 4th one.  What they did to the characters in the show is just wrong. Don't get me wrong, I'll watch the second season because I'm curious, but I'm sure I'll be disappointed because it's not like the book.  I mean her brother is a ho in the book, but what is the \\"V\\" crap, that's not in the book. There are drainers but they don't call it \\"V\\" and it doesn't make you high like in the show. I loved Layfayette in the show, but he wasn't even a big part of the books maybe a few scenes. The plot about Tara and her alcoholic mother is false too - her parents died and she didn't even show up in the series until the 2nd book and she really isn't even that close to Sookie. The best thing out of watching the show . . . Ordering the books on amazon and getting addicted to them. If you never have read the books - watch the show but don't read the books because you won't like the show anymore. TRUST ME!
B000AQACO8|5.0|This is fantastic value given the original DVD-A is selling for ridiculous amounts of money now! It's a 24 bit/96 khz recording which sounds fabulous on my Oppo 980H. Given that some of  the later  REM CD+DVD sets appear to be 24 bit / 48khz, this is a well remastered album which brings out details that were not apparent in the CD before- recommended.

There are enough compelling instrumental passages so as to suggest the nature of this being important work, but this female Jazz singer just doesn't compliment the mood properly, with an overabundance of cleverly conscious lyrics and stiff delivery crushing  most musical momentum. Ambition may contribute to the overall pretentious mood, but enough compositional salvation makes the disc at least worth checking out.
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I can't say enough about this wonderful instrumental. What an accomplishment! The music of Yo-Yo Ma has captured my artist heart. A great accompaniment for my work at the easel. I never tire of listening to the sweet/at times haunting sounds. I thank you,YO-Yo Ma, for your God given talent...your beautiful music. I highly recommend this CD,\\"Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone.\\"
8185300534|5.0|It took me a good two years to read this book. I am an avid reader, so I usually have 6 or 7 books going at once.  I read this book in small doses: a page or two a day. But as time progressed I found myself so deeply and profoundly affected that no other book could compare to it.  I survived off of this book, page by page, for months.  I would read a short section and just bask in what I had learned for hours on end.  It is difficult now to put into words how profoundly amazing this book is.  It is literally light years beyond anything I have ever read before (or since).<br /><br />There were two things I loved most about this book. First, I loved that the \\"technique\\" for realization that Nisgadatta proposes is so easy to do.  I have done exactly what he said and noticed situations in my life clearing up in ways I never imagined.  Secondly, I Am That clears up a lot of spiritual inconsistencies and contradictions I have been confused by over the years.  How does one disassociate from the physical world, while at the same time worry about meditation postures, right action, and world peace (Yes, I know there are many answers to this).  But Nisgadatta answers them in a way that makes sense.<br /><br />Most importantly is the huge boost these books receive form David R. Hawkins (Power vs. Force). He holds these books in very high regard and I trust his research.

I'm just glad this stuff is out there, and I think the only appropriate response to this music is to shut up and listen.  And, maybe tweak a few things about your life before it's over.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|Z koniunktura na TY!<br /><br />Danny Boyle - niczym mloda gwiazda - rozblysnal we wszechswiecie znanych rezyserow swoim filmem 'Trainspotting' (1996). W kolejnych latach potwierdzil swoja pozycje calkiem - moim zdaniem - udana komedia 'The Life Less Ordinary' (E.McGregor, C.Diaz, H.Hunter) oraz 'Beach' (L.DiCaprio, T.Swinton). Niestety po latach bezowocnych poszukiwan w apokalitycznych krainach Zombi ('28 Days') oraz Si-Fi ('Sunshine'), jego blask zaczal slabnac. Jednakze bedac wytrawnym rzemieslnikiem sztuki filmowej, postanowil on powrocic do zasadniczych pytan branzy rozrywkowej: \\"co sie dobrze sprzedaje?\\", \\"gdzie mozna zrealizowac produkcje o stosunkowo niewielkim budzecie?\\", \\"ktore elementy globalnej kultury sa latwo rozpoznawalne przez wiekszosc wspolczesnych ludzi?\\"<br />Otoz dobrze sprzedaja sie tematy \\"dzieci\\" oraz \\"romansow\\". A juz szczegolnym finansowym powodzeniem ciesza sie bajki o dzieciecych marzeniach, szczesliwie spelnianych po latach. Bajki, o ktorych z utesknieniem sni polowa doroslych. Egzotyczne kanwy obrazu czesto gwarantuja brzemie sukcesu nie tylko honorowego, ale i finansowego. Pomysl osadzenia akcji filmu w Indiach - kraju ze swietnie rozwinietym zapleczem realizacji kinowo-telewizyjnej - nie byl wiec bynajmniej kreacja balwana.<br />Bez wiekszego \\"kukuryku!\\" mozemy tez powiedziec, ze cywilizowana wiekszosc naszej planety zmeczona jest juz cukierkowa obluda amerykanskiej kultury. Podobnie, wiekszosc dzieli bezsilny bunt przeciwko amerykanskiemu \\"zamordyzmowi\\". Jednakowe nastroje podziela demokratycznie ukierunkowany Hollywood, o czym - oczywiscie - mowia juz nawet eskimoskie przedszkolaki.<br />Ogladajac z mojej kanapy 'Slumdog Millionaire' (Dvd,2009) pod takim katem, doszedlem do wniosku ze jest to film utkany niczym fartuch Lowicki, dziargany \\"pod turystow\\" przez lokalnego artyste.<br /><br />Hotel Detective.
1904265790|5.0|I really liked this book because it gives a fan a historical perspective of how the character evolved and how it all started.  The stories are fun and the earliest ones are a little cheesy.  I like the cheesiness of it though :)
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|Top Gun is an amazing movie plain and simple. I watched it 3 times on VHS in a row the first time I saw it. Its the perfect movie to watch with a girlfriend because it offers enough action and romance to keeps both parties interested. But i'm sure this has all been said before, the real question is \\"Is it worth it on blue ray?\\" My awnser, ABSOLUTELY. The movie looks better then ever, the blue's and oranges have been tweaked but it gives the movie a more vibrant modern look. The plains look amazing, and the in cockpit views provide some of the best detail images of any blue-ray movie released. The the visuals and audio experience manages to keep up with todays standards while still keeping the charm that made the movie so great to begin with. Whether your a old fan or a new one, this movie remains top notch, and is definitly worth the upgrade to blu-ray.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief: A Book Review  By Ms. Wagner    Have you ever wondered what the Grim Reaper did during World War II?  Did it ever occur to you that Death himself would be overwhelmed by all the killing?  In Markus Zuzak's The Book Thief Death is the narrator, and he is indeed perplexed by what's happening in Europe during World War II.  To help him sort out his grief, he finds an amazing little girl, Liesel Meminger.  She, in essence, lights up his world.  Even though Death narrates this story, he is in the background, just as the killing in the death camps were in the background during the time the story takes place.  The novel begins with the theft of a book, The Gravedigger's Bible.  Liesel steals it at her brother's funeral.  It is her first book.  Unable to care for her, Liesel's mother gives her up.  The little girl is taken in by the Hubbermanns of Molching near Munich.  Liesel grows to love her foster father, an accordion playing painter.  He is gentle and caring.  He teaches her to read using The Gravedigger's Bible.  Unlike her husband, Frau Hubberman is known for her cursing and sewing.  The Hubbermanns constitute a united front, however, when Max, a Jew, arrives on their door.  They hide Max in the basement.  Dejected and lonely, he and Liesel form a relationship around reading books and words.  Max even uses a copy of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf to make books for Liesel.  He whites out the pages, allows them to dry, and writes on them anew.  As Liesel grows, matures, and becomes an exceptional reader -not to mention a thief of books--she realizes what is happening in her country.  Eventually, the war comes closer and closer to her doorstep.  She loses people she loves.  She tries to rescue Jews as they are marched through her town to another death camp.  She struggles and rises like the ashes from her beloved street after it is bombed.  Ultimately, her life is marked by the books she steals and shares with others.   I have read recently that U.S.A. todayclaimed that The Book Thief will end up on the shelves next to Eli Wiesel's Night and The Diary of Anne Frank.  I couldn't agree more.  Zuzak's writing is surreal and heavy.  Liesel's story is one of courage and understanding.  It is so artfully told that, at times, this reader cried.  To see the atrocity of war against the background of the grief over the losses of a child somehow makes the war comprehensible in a way that has never been explored before.  After all, it is how Death made some sense of it, and he's used to this sort of thing.  Isn't he?
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Great part about this film there is authentic home film of the wire walker and crew in the 70's training and playing, really added to the experience, nice treat. The film itself is about the only man to tight rope walk (or dance as a witnessing police man said in a live interview after the act). What Philip Petit did was a awe and life aspiring feat. This should be watched by basically everyone...what made this film extra special for me is that I watched (by happenstance) maybe 2 days after seeing another documentary concerning the world trade towers. It was called \\"falling man\\", which was about the attempts of a journalist trying to uncover the identity of a man who was one of the many who choose to leap to their death than be consumed by flames following the jet attacks on the towers (the unidentified falling man was put on the front page to the shock of many viewers, that picture only ran once, remember?)...the movie is actually about more than that but that is beyond the scope of this review.<br /><br />After watching \\"Man on Wire\\" was a life affirming movie. We should all live so passionately....what else are we to do with this small amount of time given on this earth?

B001ED7C58|5.0|After seeing this film, I knew I wanted the music from it.  I would have otherwise not heard of these great bands.  I am now a new fan of theirs as well.  LOVE Blue Foundation!  Also, having Rob on the album is amazing. I never even knew he played music.  His voice is very seductive and impressive.  Also, I recommend downloading it on iTunes. You get bonus tracks, and again I have found a new love, Claire de lune, which I probably would have not come across.  Great buy for sure.
076781214X|4.0|I can't remember anybody who didn't like this movie when it came out just over 20 years ago. It was very popular, and justifiably so. It had a lot of charm to it and romance, comedy and time-travel seem to be a good mixture.    Also, it had an intriguing premise and made us think about it. If you could go back in time, knowing what you know now, would you do it and what would you do? I'm not talking short periods like in \\"Groundhog Day\\" (which was done seven years after this film) but if you could do it ALL over, from a certain point, like high school. Anyway, it's fun to think about.    Nicholas Cage and Kathleen Turner were fun to watch. If you view this film today, be prepared to be shocked how young Cage - and Jim Carrey - look in here. Turner isn't so shocking only because today we don't see her in films regularly as we do those two guys. In fact, Turner was a big star in the '80s and most people remember her looks from that period, beginning with \\"Body Heat\\" (1981). She is the star of this film, too.    When I last watched this, in the late 1990s, I found it wasn't as good as I remembered, but it still has a lot of charm and sentiment to it. It helps to be fascinated by time travel, which I am.    If you are a film buff, you'll be shocked at all the familiar faces in this movie, from veteran actors like John Carradine to a young Helen Hunt. Check out the names in this cast! If you haven't seen this film, you owe it to yourself. I'm not saying it's terrific, but it's definitely worth your while not just for the actors but the thought-provoking subject matter.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was fascinating to read step-by-step and moment-by-moment, from her own perspective, as Dr. Taylor's brain function deteriorated as a result of her stroke. I felt much admiration for her as she described her attempts to get help - from the first realization she needed help to the enormous focus and patience required to just dial the phone to get that help.   Reading about the recovery stage after her stroke was also very interesting and inspiring. She was very fortunate to have a mother who had the right balance of patience and firmness to assist her in returning to a person who has the use of both sides of her brain. I believe Dr. Taylor's trust in her own healing process was also instrumental in her recovery.  I wondered, as I read the book, how it was possible for someone with such profound damage to her brain to remember, after she recovered, what her thoughts and feelings had been while that damage was occurring.  Her recollection as written was not vague, but very specific. Perhaps she explains that on her website - I'll have to go look.  This book was a good read - interesting and inspiring. I'm glad I bought it.    Alexandra Aina, co-author of [[ASIN:B001SN7UMO Emotional Triangle: A True Story of Overcoming Childhood Trauma, Years of Grief, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]]
B000R8YC1I|5.0|The Dark Crystal is probably one of the most beloved fantasy tales of all time. There is a bit of reference to some of the Final Fantasy games in here and the story is timeless. Too bad the movie did not exert well on DVD. There was a decent special edition that Columbia put out in 1999, but the picture and audio sucked miserably. Then there was a supposed collector's edition released in 2002 I think and that version was literally a sour double dip. Also to add, WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!. Finally in 2007, Columbia released what may be the best presentation of this film yet. The 2-disc 25th Anniversary Edition brings this film to life finally. Very little grain and the special effects look better than ever. The Blu-Ray should be out by now so I can't imagine what that will look like. Save your money and snag this version or the Blu-ray but I got this version. It's not that expensive on Amazon and some stores sell it at a decent price. The set also comes with some decent material as well so go for this version. You won't be disappointed.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|Being a Jane Austen novel (this edition brought to the screen courtesy the BBC), you know it's primarily a chick flick, a romance novel with old English spoken, very nicely photographed with nice period sets and scenery and some interesting women to view.    What's different about this is the leading actress: Amanda Root, who plays \\"Anne Elliot.\\" In America, this is not a lady whom we are familiar with, so she was a new \\"face\\" for me, as well. I liked her. I've heard criticism of her looks. You don't have to be glamorous to be accepted as a fine female actor. She was excellent in her role and just the looks on her face, particularly the sad looks, spoke more \\"volumes\\" than any dialog could manage.
B0013NS6EU|1.0|The book discusses some interesting ideas.  Unfortunately, those ideas are explored with drawings (which makes sense given the subject) that are totally illegible using Kindle for iPhone.    A complete waste of money.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|This is a long but interesting character study of a real-life person: General George S. Patton, probably the most famous military men of World War II.  Over the years, better DVD transfers of this film keep coming out and now we have a great Blu-Ray version. It just gets better and better!    How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction, I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made - during the heyday of the anti-war (Vietnam) movement - I have my suspicions but  WWII buffs I've talked to pretty much  back up this film.  Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have, Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way, thanks to the acting of George C. Scott, who was astounding as Patton. He gives us one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.    Not only is Scott's acting superb, the widescreen photography is also good. Thank goodness DVDs came out so films like this could be seen in the aspect ratio in which they were filmed.  As for special-effects, the explosions and machine-gun fire was realistic, especially for a film that is now approaching 40 years old.    Nonetheless, if you enjoy character studies, this is one of the best. Patton's opening 6-minute speech before this huge American flag is a famous scene in movie history. That, and the rest of his performance and this movie in general, is one you won't forget.
B001DJLD1M|3.0|There's no reason to spend more money on the Matrix Box Set unless you want all of the additional footage from behind the scenes ETC.  This has ONLY the movies and that was good enough for me.  In my opinion though, only the first Matrix is worth watching more than once.  The 2nd and 3rd one are flashy with effects but the stories suck.  There were no problems with the discs.  Buy this if you just want the movies!

0240808452|5.0|In my drawing classes, I've always wondered why my drawings looked so boring and lifeless. I knew they were missing some sort of boost, but I couldn't figure out why. After I've read through this book, I can honestly say drawing figures has been so much easier. The book clearly explains the fundamentals of what gives any pose and powerful feel of flow, even for simple standing poses. Reread the concepts if you need to, and study what's going on in the sketches. Once you master applying his lessons, your characters will have much more life even in the sketch's earliest stages. Don't just look at the images in this book. Analyze and study its construction. It will pay off.

B000VWYJ86|4.0|I enjoy movies that are nonstop obstacle courses; in that respect, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM does not disappoint.  This third installment of the Bourne franchise features grim-faced Matt Damon as a former CIA hit man with no identity--but an unwavering determination to whip out a can of payback.  Being chased and hounded by the very organization that created his deadly persona, Damon's Jason Bourne leads the viewer through three different continents at breakneck speed and high-powered action.  I love the pacing of this movie; from the very start it puts a lead foot on the gas and never, ever lets up.<br /><br />Damon, a formidable combatant no one wants to mess with, is solid; Albert Finney is even better as the soul-sucking head of the CIA's clandestine \\"project\\".  Julia Styles makes me want to go outside and howl at the moon.  I get the jerky, shaky, handheld camera/documentary ploy, but must confess it is a tad overdone.  When a film looks like the director pulled a stranger out of a 24-hour bar to operate the camera then we might have just a little overkill.  And THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM deserves better.<br />--D.

0743298039|4.0|This book will delight true book lovers, from it's cover depicting beautiful old leather volumes and the end pages with it's marbleized patterns, to the spine of the book under the dust jacket which is beautifully embossed in gold.<br /><br />The story itself feels old.  Setterfield is clever to leave out specific dates in any of the details of the story and in doing so gives it a timeless feel.<br /><br />It's simultaneously ghost story, mystery and pseudo-biography.  The story itself is flawlessly woven together.<br /><br />Our narrator is Margaret, a biographer who is recording the life story of Vida Winter the famous author.  Winter has recounted innumerable inaccurate histories of her life but claims that this time she wants to tell her true life's story.  Margaret isn't certain that Ms. Winter is being completely honest with her.  She maintains a healthy dose of skepticism and checks facts where she is able.  Margaret's own story is revealed to us as she puzzles through discoveries about Ms. Winters' life.<br /><br />Rarely do I finish a book and hesitate to start another.  This is one of those books that I want to ruminate on after finishing it and savor the characters and the stories of their lives.
B001RCUL5Y|4.0|Let's just clarify at the beginning. If you are looking to just own the movie, buy the less expensive regular BEDTIME STORIES DVD.  However, if you or your family enjoys the special features that usually are included with movies, you'll want to purchase this, the DELUXE DVD EDITION of BEDTIME STORIES.<br /><br />In 2008 Sandler starred in two movies. One (YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN) was a complete bust on all accounts.  The other was BEDTIME STORIES, a film the critic meeting with mediocrity, but that was made major box office during the Christmas season.  The film has a pretty decent story line with enough laughs for kids and adults and is actually quite family friendly (the movie was the first Happy Gilmore Production to receive a PG rating).<br /><br />Sandler portrays Skeeter Bronson the son of a father (Jonathan Pryce) who attempted to fulfill his life dream of owning and operating a small hotel.  However, Skeeter's dad just isn't a very good businessmen and ends up having to sell his hotel to Barry Nottingham (Richard Griffiths), but only on the condition that when Skeeter is grown that he will be made manager.  The deal is struck and Nottingham tears down the quaint hotel and builds a luxurious, mega-hotel.  He keeps Skeeter around as the head janitor, but soon forgets the promise he made.  When Skeeter learns that Nottingham is going to be building a new hotel, he believes this is his big break, but then Nottingham announces his future son-in-law, Kendall (Guy Pierce) will be the manager of the new hotel.  Skeeter is heartbroken.  However, he does have other matters to occupy part of his time because his sister, Wendy (Courtney Cox) has to leave town for a job interview and asks Skeeter to watch over her kids, Patrick (Jonathan Morgan Heti) and Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling), in the evenings and overnight.  Wendy has already arranged for a friend of hers, Jill (Keri Russell) to watch the kids during the day but in the evenings she has classes to attend.  Initially Skeeter is a bit hesitant with the kids and he absolutely abhors Jill.  However, after an evening of bedtime stories the kids are hooked and bond is made between them.  The next morning events from the bedtime story he told that night before begin to come true.  Skeeter is amazed and then attempts to manipulate his nephew and niece ideas to allow his own dreams come true, but true to life, things don't exactly turn out the way he imagines.<br /><br />I really enjoyed BEDTIME STORIES.  The idea of the film is not exactly a new one, but it was done in a fresh and interesting way.  The film has a great amount of family humor, with nothing too gross and very little crudity.  The movie also has some very positive messages about family and living in a community.  Bedtime stories can have a major impact upon children and I really enjoyed how the filmmakers used this concept as a way of strengthening the bonds between emotionally-distanced family members.  Unlike some other recent Sandler projects, BEDTIME STORIES has no pretensions about being some kind of movie it isn't.

0316017922|4.0|The development of Gladwell's arguments is amazing at times. He takes heavily engrained thought processes that we have about certain things and breaks them down in a way that has you wondering at the end how you didn't manage to think of the same thing. The book will make you take a step back and ponder what kind of things you really think determine success.<br /><br />The only problem was that some of the solutions he had to problems do seem fairly impracticial. He also talks about the opportunities presented to both himself and his family because of a chain of events that happened in the past 100 years relating to their color and race. He writes about how if everyone were presented with similar opportunities, perhaps they could also have great success. Many of these opportunites, however, were things that developed more out of chance than anything. (Common element to the book-Success developing in large part from chance/luck)<br /><br />Regardless, definately an interesting read and tough to put down.

0743270754|5.0|I just finished reading Team of Rivals this very minute. First, may I say that I am ever so sad to be finished reading this incredible piece of work. Over 750 pages, I cringed everytime I moved my bookmark closer to the back.    This excellent work of literary art covers the life of Lincoln, from his youth all the way to the heartbreaking assassination. Ms. Goodwin flawlessly fills 750 pages with Lincoln's life journey.    Along the way in Lincoln's life, we are introduced in absolute riveting detail to characters that President Lincoln meets and who help shape the cabinet when he enters the office.    I have always had a pedestrian view of Mr. Lincoln. I knew OF him, and that he was a good president.     But this book has made me a novice in the minute details of Mr. Lincoln's Presidency, the Civil War and the contributions made by President Lincoln and his Team of Rivals.    I usually give most of my books away after reading them. But this one I am keeping. I look forward to the day when I am ready to read it again and be just as riveted and impressed. Thank You Ms. Goodwin.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|Ok, I gave this a good, objective, honest chance...and it still sucks. No, really. I don't want Chris to just go back to grunge...he's already done that.  He can write any kind of album he wants to, so long as it's good (Eurphoria Morning was a massive change and was brilliant), but this stuff just isn't.<br /><br />The songwriting is bland, the production is overdone, the synths are cheesy late 80s loops, the drums sound like a Casio, Chris' vocals are so processed that it sounds like he's singing through a straw, and the lyrics barely qualify as bad Hallmark card schlock.  Chris \\"dropping\\" lyrics like \\"the b*tch ain't a part of me?\\"  Are you kidding me?  That is the kind of stupidity I expect from some joke like Kanye West, not the brilliant lyical mind of Cornell.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion (and I fully realize that everyone has one), probably the worst album by any really good artist in the last 15 years.  I can't find a single redeeming quality about it....<br /><br />I've been a fan of Chris' since the late 80s when he was putting out stuff like Louder Than Love with Soundgarden, and I stayed on board through Temple of the Dog, all of the Soundgarden changes, Audioslave, and his solo material, all of which constitute significant sound changes.  I'm not upset that Chris wants change, I'm not disappointed that he wants to experiment, and I certainly don't begrudge him freedom as an artist.  However, at the end of the day, if the experiment is lousy, then it's lousy.  Scientists count on experimental failure in order to better understand how to create success.  Hopefully, Chris will understand what a massive misstep this collection is, and while not returning to the same sound he's produced before, will return to focusing on solid songs played by actual musicians.<br /><br />Sorry, Chris--I admire the big swing, but this is a miss.
B000W91RUG|3.0|I love the pop culture references in this show - especially the sci-fi ones. A must for any \\"geek\\" lover.
B00023B1A8|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He watched it once and won't be watching it again.  He expected the same perfected sound as on the Greatest Hits CD.  Over all, it was a good performance and a good re-visit of the past, but if you love the classic perfect sound, stick with the CD.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|If you've never heard of Keith Urban or his songs, you are really missing something wonderful.  This is the CD to buy!  The songs on these CD's take you back to a first kiss with someone new to not giving up on love and thanking the one you love.  Keith has another hit with this CD.  The songs are happy and witty.  It will give you hope.  Keith Urban is one of the greatest song writers and guitar players of our time.   I saw him in person the other night and he played 4 of these songs and he sounds just like the CD.  His songs are honest and go right to the heart.   Can't stop listening to this one!
B000001GXC|5.0|Excellent, excellent work. Very enjoyable. If you appreciate Beethoven's symphonies, and are not familiar with Felix Mendelssohn's work, you must get this CD. Deep rich melodic symphonic sounds, more mellow perhaps than Beethoven. People who may not consider themselves as listeners of classical music will enjoy these symphonies.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was my first exposure to Jillian Michaels.  I consider myself in pretty good shape and workout regularly on the treadmill; my attitude going in was that level one would be a bore and level two might also be \\"too easy\\" for me....ha ha.    Well, I was surprised and humbled to find even the first level of her workout tough....    This is not Jane Fonda (for those who remember her videos!)...no water breaks here!  But when Jillian says you'll feel more stamina as early as day one, she's right.       The intense cardio-strength combination is a lot different from a treadmill or rowing machine workout, with much to offer regardless of fitness level.  It's a huge bonus that the routine is fast, easy to follow, and takes up almost no space.    Beginners will be inspired and experienced exercisers will not be disappointed with the results.    Highly recommended!
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Much inferior to its predecessor, \\"Casino Royale.\\" What happened? Some interesting setup, and then we learn it's All About Water, that American spies don't bat an eyelash about sanctioning the murder of a British spy for reasons of allegedly exigent foreign policy, and other such nonsense. Some interesting bits and shots, and Craig is a better Bond than most who have played him, but there's no there there. After having seen it in the theater, I was too bored to watch it all again on the DVD. Disappointing, especially since \\"Casino Royale\\" was a much-needed and riveting re-boot of the series.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|After listening to snippets of this album, it sounds like the old days of when the A&R people took over the artist and told him/her what to do and how to do it. I thought those days were gone in the late 60's.<br /><br />I have tickets to see Diana in June. I hope Diana doesn't choose the same fare or bring the orchestra with her, or I will be out cold for the evening.<br /><br />PLEASE, BRING BACK THE REAL DIANA!<br /><br />While Verve may have been on top four decades ago, this proves that the day of the recording labels is over.<br /><br />Astrud was well cast for this music and with Stan Getz on tenor, you couldn't ask for more, but please, this is not Diana's music! I love Diana, but let her do her own thing--not Verve's! Let it remain with Getz and Gilberto. Astrid Gilberto/Stan Getz and is still a classic today!<br /><br />Diana, don't let Verve shut down your funky piano, your wit and your humor. Bring back the quartet! Dump the label! It is a dis-service to your artistry!

I'm now 135 pages into this thing, and I still have no clue that a crime (other than a \\"crime against the State\\") has been committed. I doubt that I'll go much more deeply into it.

See them live if you get the chance, you won't regret it!
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|After having listened to this album here and there for the last few months, I have to make a few observations:<br /><br />- Loud (and louder) does not necessarily equate to interesting.<br />- Though there seems to be more &#34;energy&#34; on this record, I feel like this energy is just a product of the in-your-face production by Jacknife Lee, not a product of the music itself.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this record, but I just found the &#34;energy&#34; of this record forced and in-authentic, and none of the tunes hold a candle to those produced by the band in the 80s and 90s.  In addition, I truly resent the ridiculously poor sound quality of this CD.  I hope in the future that R.E.M. can do better.
0316017922|4.0|What made the Beatles so successful? Was it their innate talent, cultural background, age, historical era, hard work or just plain luck?<br /><br />ANSWER: Yes. (All of the above.)<br /><br />That's the basic theme of Malcolm Gladwell's fun little book, \\"Outliers.\\" Great individual success is rarely the result of genius or talent alone, Gladwell says. We are all products of our time and our circumstances. Even Bill Gates admits that he was \\"extraordinarily lucky\\" to get access to a time-share computer system during high school. Even Mozart had unique advantages as a child that contributed to his later success.<br /><br />After several months on the bestseller list, most reviewers agree on a few basic points about \\"Outliers\\":<br /><br />1. It's fun to read and intellectually stimulating, but not a work of scholarship.<br />2. Most of Gladwell's text is based on research done by others.<br />3. He downplays certain facts for the sake of argument.<br /><br />Generally speaking, I think Gladwell is right. It's quite probable that the Beatles would NOT have achieved global superstar status without the right combination of luck, timing, talent and outside help. The other magic ingredient was hard work -- lots of it.<br /><br />As Gladwell explains in the chapter named \\"The 10,000-Hour Rule,\\" mastering a major skill takes about 10,000 hours of practice -- whether it be programming a computer or performing music in front of a live audience. The Beatles, for example, had a rare opportunity to sharpen their skills at the Star Club in Hamburg, Germany, long before they became famous. In less than two years, they performed more stage hours than most band members get in a lifetime. When \\"Please, Please Me\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" hit the charts in 1963, they were ready to conquer the musical world.<br /><br />All too often, in my experience, our young people want to soar without doing the hard work first. Our pop culture constantly fawns over prodigies and celebrates \\"overnight success\\" in shows like \\"American Idol\\" and \\"America's Next Top Model.\\" Unfortunately for aspiring young people, most success does not come this way. Not in the arts. Not in sports. And certainly not in business.<br /><br />Gladwell's chapter on rice farming in Asia and the famous Asian work ethic is another example of this principle. As the Chinese proverb says: \\"No one who can rise before dawn 360 days a year fails to make his family rich\\" (p. 238). Persistent effort doesn't guarantee success, but it sure makes it more likely. For that reason, I think \\"Outliers\\" should be added to every high school curriculum.<br /><br />Some reviewers sharply criticize \\"Outliers\\" for being shallow, derivative or unconvincing. To them I would say this: This is a short work of popular non-fiction. It's not supposed to be scholarly or comprehensive. Even if you despise this little book, you'll have to admit that Gladwell has forced thousands of readers to reconsider the origins of success.<br /><br />Here's an analogy: A friend of mine who studied marine biology has nothing good to say about Jacques Cousteau. \\"He was a self-promoting media hound with very limited professional training,\\" says my friend. My response is that Cousteau did the world a great service by exposing millions of TV viewers to the wonders of marine live while simultaneously raising awareness about serious environmental issues.<br /><br />As Voltaire said: \\"The perfect is the enemy of the good.\\" And that's good enough for me. Read the book and decide for yourself.t Top Model.\\" Unfortunately for aspiring young people, most success does not come this way. Not in the arts. Not in sports. And certainly not in business.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been doing this video for 15 days now and it is very challenging, even with shorter 20 minute workouts, and is great for gradually increasingly your strength/endurance to proceed onto workouts 2 and 3.

B001ZRYQSO|4.0|This is the same old Cohen-ian deep dark smooth as silk voice as before. Who can say he is 70+ as he performs live at London.    I heard this 2 disc set on NPR live streaming and was floored to hear the master at this best - the same wry homour, same deep poetical lyrics.    Many of the songs are his previous work as usual. If you like Cohen as he was before, you can ut not like this set of songs as he performs today.    The Live experience adds to the mood of the songs and to listen to him as he performs gives a glimpse into the man himself.
B00003CX8N|4.0|Enjoyed the dvd,I am a fan of Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins,would watch just about anything in which they appeared.

Hopefully the cost will come down a bit??JUdi Dench is another favorite of mine and is in so many things over the years,I watch the BBC shows on TV which she appears.

B00008LOS1|5.0|Sure we have all heard the Who's Next studio album a million times and it is one of the best all time classic rock albums but this Deluxe Edition is all about the live tracks. These live tracks are awesome and the sound quality is loud and clear.   This album catches this quartet at their absolute peak and I rank the disk two above the \\"Live at Leeds\\" album mainly because the song selection is better. No prissy tunes from \\"Tommy\\" here. The first three tracks on disc two \\"Love aint for Keeping\\",\\"Pure and Easy\\", and \\"Young Man Blues\\", are non stop raw energy. Pete complianing about the fan dancing (apparently on stage) after \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" is unreal.....\\"because this is a new song and it is hard to remember the chords\\".   The best track is \\"Bargain\\" with Pete humming in place of a synthesizer and Keith still sober enough to pound out the beat like only he can. At first I thought this could of been recorded in a garage somewhere but upon a second listen you will conclude this is raw rock and roll at its best.  Get this album it is a frickin bargain.
0307277453|4.0|I was initially turned off by the title of this book.  I thought it was yet another book presenting a nutty diet or obtuse health plan.  I guess the main objection is the implication of naive Lamarckian evolution that all species are trying to evolve into humans.  Humans haven't been evolving since the Devonian because they didn't become human until about 3 mya.  With that said, I was pleasantly surprised that the book presented good insights and sound information regarding evolution leading up to our own species.  It is an excellent read and I highly recommend it for those who like to read about primitive features that have found \\"unanticipated\\" new uses; a process that has so many parallels in technological development and biological evolution.  Creationists will not like this book.  Reality keeps biting them in the behind.
0375842209|5.0|This book was amazing.  At first I was skeptical as it was formated a little differently than most \\"typical books,\\" and through the first part of the book, I remained skeptical and considered just putting it away and not finishing it, but I am sooo glad I didn't.  I soon forgot the different format and was hooked.  The story was told beautifully, and the ending would not have had the impact it did if it had been told any differently.  This book made the holocaust and the World War more real for me than any other book I've read on the subject.  I loved the writer, and his straightforward style.  This book was pure genious.

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm does a great job of dispelling that success comes so easy for some.  In fact they have worked really hard at it, about 10,000 hours, and they were also lucky along the way, they were in the right spot (born at the right time) for opportunities to come along that helps them become the success.  Not only that, but culturally and history have all been working hard to help someone become successful.<br /><br />It's hard to say if the book is inspirational or scientific, at the end, I found that it could be easy to throw up my arms and say that there isn't much I have control over and not try, but then again, I realize that not everything may work in perfect in alignment for success, it's the fact that it requires hard work and dedication and with that, you can create your own level of success.<br /><br />Thanks Malcolm for the look inside and behind success.

Oh baby, where have you been all these years? This album is a flawed masterpiece.  Where to start?  Well Echoes. I must be the last person on earth not to have listened to this high. It does not need chemicals, it is perfect. It is the wildest flight of fantasy you will ever hear. Play, replay and play again.  Next flip over to One of These Days. A dirty, nasty, hateful, inspired piece of driving rock. It rips out of your speakers and blows you t othe back of the room.  er \\"Fearless\\"?

0307346617|5.0|First thing to know about this book. It's NOT about Zombies. It's about governments. This is a social/political allegory that details mans' reaction to something it doesn't truly understand and applying failed logic to fix the problem. Max Brooks does an excellent job describing different reactions taken by different governments of the world and their flawed mentalities. You can take out the word Zombie and replace it with \\"terrorist\\" and the story would be just as good. This book should be required reading for any student going for a Political Science degree. It's that spot on.

0765348276|4.0|This is a great read, with a new and interesting concept or idea to wrap your mind around in every chapter.   It will be difficult to put down once you start.  The author was clearly influenced and utilized the tone and viewpoint of others, especially Heinlein, but in the best way and Scalzi definitely has his own voice as well.  The book is in PG-13 to R territory language wise, with the \\"F\\" word used dozens of times and a few (fairly tame) sex scenes.   I personally would not let my 12 or 14 year old read it.  For those over 50, there are some laugh out loud observations about old age that occur throughout the book and are worth the price of admission by themselves.    I look forward to reading the sequels.

B000E1ZBFY|4.0|I wanted to see this film because Karol Wojtyla/Pope John Paul II was a major figure in 20th-Century history, and a fascinating person in his own right.  Being Jewish, I also wanted to see how the film would treat the Polish Pope's early life in Poland during the Holocaust, and whether or not it would deal with the Catholic Church's overall silence with respect to the Holocaust.    The film is emotionally compelling and engrossing.  An amazingly talented Polish actor, Piotr Adamczyk, portrays Karol Wojtyla as a gifted, compassionate young student/budding artist who decides to devote his life to the priesthood in response to the horrors he witnessed and experienced during the Nazi invasion and occupation of Poland.  The film disproportionately highlights and celebrates the \\"Righteous Gentiles\\" among Wojtyla's college friends; while it is very likely true that a Polish intellectual in his early 20's during the late 1930's probably socialized exclusively with fellow Poles who were not anti-Semitic, the film ignores and eliminates by avoidance the huge problem of endemic anti-Semitism throughout Polish culture.    Thus, the film is intrinsically biased in favor of showing Polish Catholicism particularly, and the Catholic Church in general, as innocent, when history shows that it is not.  I think this is understandable, but it is an obvious bias and should be taken into account when viewing.    Overall, the film is a very fine work of art, and the performance of Piotr Adamczyk really brings the character of Karol Wojtyla to life.  I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in understanding major figures in 20th/21st century world history, but would caution them to keep in mind the vested interests involved in the making of the film.

0385340990|5.0|Dear Readers,<br /><br />I have a confession to make, and the sooner I get it off my chest, the better.  I admit that the outlandish title of this book, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society, left me wondering if I'd ever actually read it. Many recommended this book to me, but I couldn't get past the awkward sounding, eight-word title. Guernsey brought to mind that special breed of cows--not anything to do with books or literary circles-- and it took me a while to even be able to recite the title properly. Furthermore, potato peel pie, quite frankly, sounded utterly unappealing to me,  and I wondered if the book held any appeal for me at all.  But, because this book received so many glowing reviews, I knew I'd read it--eventually. And I'm glad that I made the effort recently.  Now I realize that the title is just right--its very oddness is wonderful--and I don't stumble over the title words quite as much.<br /><br />An interesting, well-written letter is worth it's weight in gold, especially in this age of email and instant messages. Published in 2008, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society  is a set of letters from Juliet, a writer in London, to the other characters in the book, many of whom live in Guernsey,  one of the Channel Islands (part of Great Britain but located in the English Channel, close enough to see mainland Europe with the naked eye). This is an epistolary book, a novel written as a series of documents, letters in this case. (I wish I could write such dramatic letters!) Written with ample warmth and humor, these letters form a novel that's an original celebration of books and the written word, and of human connection.<br /><br />In this sensational novel, written by Mary Ann Schaffer and Annie Barrows, the title literary club is formed, literally, in self-defense.  During World War II, Guernsey was occupied by the Germans for five years, who, among other things,  imposed strict curfews on the villagers.  Caught heading home past curfew after an illegal dinner of roast pork, an assorted group of islanders form The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society--out of the need for an immediate alibi.  In order to validate their claim, the members of this newly formed literary group decide to hold actual subsequent meetings (sometimes featuring desserts such as potato peel pie, the only pie they could make with the scant supplies available). To their surprise, especially since several of the members had never read much before, the club soon ignites a genuine love of reading and books, as well as some intense literary debates.<br /><br />As London emerges from the shadow of World War II in 1946, writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. She is contacted by a native of Guernsey, who has discovered her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb.  As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the intriguing world of this man, Dawsey,  a pig farmer, and other members of the book club who also write to her.  Juliet begins a prolific correspondence with the society's members--charming them (and us!) with her marvelous letters--and learning about their island, their book preferences, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sails to Guernsey, and the course of her own life is greatly altered.<br /><br />I absolutely adore this line from the book, and although it is on the inside book jacket, I will repeat it here because it is superb:<br /><br />\\"Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.\\"<br /><br />That is exactly how I felt about this book: that it was precisely what I needed to read.  This happens to me fairly often. I pick up a book and quickly realize it's what I need to be reading, that it has significance and relates to my life in some way in an almost uncanny manner.  In this instance, it's significance was mostly due to all the\\"book talk\\".<br /><br />If you read only one book published in 2008, choose this one. You will not be disappointed!<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br />SukoIf you read only one book published in 2008, choose this one. You will not be disappointed!    Yours sincerely,  Suko
0060751967|3.0|I gave this book 3 stars because it has a good story line and good characters, BUT it falls way short on the romance and their are very little sensual encounters between the main characters Roman Draganesti the rich handsome vampire and Shanna Whelan a dentist. Vampires should be strong and romantic in their sensual prowess and seductions of mortals but this was weak and it ends abruptly without settling the new couple into their new lives togather, Its just not developed enough!!!!!
B000060OFT|5.0|this movie is a modern interpretation of shakespeare's tragedy of romeo and juliet. while the dialogue stays faithful to the play, the visuals were modernized and some minor liberties were taken, most notably by exchanging swords for guns (named sword 9mm) and implied drug use.    im not a huge fan of the silly beginning of the movie, but it quickly becomes more serious. i absolutely love the art direction and photography in this film and while im not a huge dicaprio fan, his acting is very solid with glimses into pure brilliance. his most moving scene is when he confronts and murders mercutio after tybalts death.    overall, i absolutely love this film. ive tivoed it several times and ive now watched the dvd close to a half dozen times in less than the same number of weeks. i absolutely love this film
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is not your average \\"dancing\\" or \\"Cinderella\\" chick flic. The characters are finely drawn and the dancing complements the story line. I saw the movie by chance - didn't have anything better to do - and rushed to purchase my own copy ASAP. Highly recommended!
0618918248|1.0|Im an atheist for the most part but after reading this book I became compelled to challenge some of the conclusions by Richard Dawkins.<br /><br />Dr Dawkins seems to make a swift conclusion that it is rather improbable that an all-knowing entity could exist. A non-complex entity which could listen to all our thoughts and hear all our prayers seems like an improbable scenario for Dr Dawkins. And this notion is the foundation for which he draws most of his conclusions in this book.<br /><br />But then I thought about such a scenario.. could it exist?<br /><br />Entertain my thoughts for a little while<br /><br />In the last century, technology has advanced to bring people closer. Within a short timeframe, telegrams allowed us to communicate long distances, television allowed us to see around the world, mobile ohones to keep in contact, and the internet allowed us to interact effortlessly. And now very quickly social sites like Facebook have taken over the world. I know what my friend halfway across the world ate for breakfast. Status updates, Amazon reviews, blogs... and recently with the advent of the google glasses, interactivity is accelerating exponentially. And what we might actually be witnessing is the primitive, infant stages of a future where people all over the world can plug into a single hub. Sharing their inner thoughts. an all knowing single hub that collectively knows what everyone is thinking and doing. Imagine people having augmented chips plugging them straight into this single source.<br /><br />You might think im smoking high. But ask yourself why this isnt inevitable on a long enough timeline. That by considering the very science Richard Dawkins has spent his life studying, we could actually conclude that human beings will evolve into one singular entity. Connect. Come full circle. And that one entity represents the very god he thinks is improbable.<br /><br />He is assertion that an all-knowing god like entity is impractical and improbable is too hasty. And it is these types of assertions he makes which make his argument weak for me. This book was not written as a scientific conclusion on the subject of God. It was merely his own rational conclusion based on what he predicts, and what is probable.<br /><br />As an agnostic/atheist Im challenging these conclusions<br /><br />Now im aware that such an entity does not exist here and now but we are yet to fully comprehend how 'time' can possibly relate to a single all-knowing computer driven entity from the future.<br /><br />Point being ive come away from this book feeling even more confused.o hasty.

B001ED7C58|5.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack...has been in my vehicle since day one and I've not grown tired of listening to it yet.
0571202284|5.0|The book is great. It have a lot of info on how to animate correctly characters. This is a must for animators and newbie. There is some history and part of the story of the author on how he goes in this industry. Really interesting.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|We not only loved this movie at our house, but we especially enjoyed the sing-along features included on this version.  We have played them over and over again.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I think all Judas Priest is incredible. With Nostradamus, they have created a Masterpiece!  Rob Halford's vocals just get better all the time, and the guitar playing is superior. It proves what a great band Judas Priest really is.  The Metal Gods are mature, and show their true confidence in this album. The range of their career has bloomed with the coming of Nostradamus.  They are to be forever remembered as the Metal Gods!
B0007LXPBI|4.0|I rented this movie recently after the tragic death of Natasha Richardson March 18, 2009.  It made me sad to see this beautiful, talented woman in a lovely movie, knowing we'll never see her in another one again.  She was so young and vibrant, and she really shines in \\"The Parent Trap\\".  It's really eerie watching a movie or listening to a song, after the actress or singer died young and tragically, and you realize you know how and when they'll die, and under what circumstances.  It's not the same if they die old and by natural circumstances.      I always liked this movie, and now I appreciate it more than ever.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|I watched this series when it was on tv and that waas why I wanted to buy it.  It was fun and kind of suspenseful to know that a teenager can solve crimes/problems.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This outstanding documentary plays like a top-notch work of fiction.  It's exciting, of course, but it's also hilarious at times -- with a cast of compelling, oddball characters right out of a Monty Python skit.  Highly (pun intended) recommended!
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|we are very pleased with this dvd, was received in excellent condition with on time delivery
B001NXBRJG|5.0|Just purchased this blu-Ray today and I am happy with it.  1080p Picture, DDTrueHD (I only have a 5.1 system) sound a bonus Digital Copy of the Matrix for you home PC.  only paid 24.99 at Fry's Electronics for it.  Good deal.    This is the fourth film I've purchase this year (one each month) and I am slowly growing my collection, this is definitely a movie that should be in most peoples movie collections.    I'm using my PC to play these blu-rays and they look and sound great :-)
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This isn't a real review...I love this movie...made me cry...    Now the good news for those who got a copy without special features:    I filled out the form at slumdogdvd.orderassistance.com yesterday at noon...my replacement is coming today via UPS...they are fixing their screw-up at a rapid rate...
1577314808|2.0|The book came to me in good shape and as stated in the description when i bought it.  I just DO NOT LIKE this book!! It was a waste of my money!!  it's too hard to understand so much of it and I struggled through what I DID read although i didn't finish it.  It's just not interesting.  (to me).
B001VSZ7RQ|5.0|Defying Gravity is full of incredible songs. It is a Keith Urban best.  I love every song.  His greatest job yet.  I have every one of his albums and the songs on this album are well worth buying.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|Of all the manifestations of the Star Trek series' this is by far my favorite.  The plots are cohesive and well written, the characters are complex and well developed, and the actors are all attractive.  That being said, my favorite character is the least attractive (not necessarily the least attractive actor) is Dr. Phlox.  John Billingsley is good in other roles, but he shines in this role!  And the rest of the cast is outstanding as well.  My only complaint is that it only ran for four seasons.  When will the makers of Star Trek get it?  Those of us who love Star Trek will watch it.  Stop canceling on us!
B001VB8UAE|4.0|a concert filled with wonderful moments. I also rushed to get the UK version with all 3 discs region free and pal, playable on US DVD player and flat TV. Although the concert 2006 DVD is the first Streisand concert DVD in 16:9 format, the picture quality is a bit disappointing. Movement and resolution could be better. Wonder if it was shot in HD. I did enjoy very much the DTS 5.1 mix though. DVD2 is similar in quality to the previous release of the MGM show.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|This film is a lot of fun! Lots of great action, and I just flat get a kick out of watching drift cars doing their thing (these ridiculous \\"Drift Comps\\" are stupid and boring. Drifting was created for mountain roads, NOT parking lots or sections of GP track like you see on TV).One thing I have issue with is the way the Yakuza is portrayed in the film. Yakuza are ruthless and lethal in the way they do business. The Yakuza seem to be near-bumbling fools in \\"Tokyo Drift\\". It was likewise nice to see \\"Konishiki\\" in the bathhouse sequence (he was one of America's premiere Sumo Wrestlers in Japan, back in the late 80's).Lucas Black has come a ways from his \\"Sling Blade\\" role some years back. He plays culture shock well. Japan HAS come far from it's post-war reconstruction, to be a world leader in technology, especially robotics.\\"Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift\\" departs from the two previous films in location and actors, but I see that the next \\"F and F\\" film returns to the combo that started it all- Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Hope it turns out great, because the first three films were!!
B001BWQWKS|5.0|What a sensational disc! At a time when there is a multitude of crack new quartets, Quatuor Ebéne here stake their claim to join the top rank with riveting playing that encompasses an almost other-worldly sound-range. The Debussy especially left me reeling. With Ebéne, the Pavel Haas players, the Belceas, the Pacificas, Jerusalems and more, chamber fans are in good hands for the next few decades at least.    -- Gramophone [12/2008]
B001N26GBQ|5.0|Kylie Minogue is back, and better than ever. This show is even better than Homecoming or Showgirl, bringing a renewed and sexy Kylie. Great performances, great coreography, and the photography is beautiful.    Don't waste your time and buy it right now.
B00133KHCY|1.0|Never was able to even watch the movie.THE BLU-RAY movie was defective<br />i emailed the seller and told him the problem and i was instructed to return it and mark it refused and my dvd warehouse also said, that they would replace the movie as we'll as pay theshipping cost also.i Never<br />got any response regarding this purchase. Thanks to amazon.com i got<br />a refund less the shipping cost to my dvd warehouse. I will never deal<br />with them again.
0375842209|5.0|Mr. Zusak takes you into the life of a child during Nazi Germany and it's hard for you to leave that little girl whenever you set down the book.  When the book ended, you're left with extraordinary feelings that stay with you and make you want to read more about this era in history.  Keep the tissues handy, it's very emotional.
0316067601|5.0|I could not put this book down. Stayed up for 2 nights to be able to finish. I cried and my heart was beating out of my chest. Thank God for the Marcus Luttrell's of the world. Made me proud to be an American and glad to see we have such great warrior Patriots out there protecting and defending us. I feel like this is a must read for every American.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|As a Diana Krall fan, I was eager for new material and pre-ordered on the basis of my trust in her musical sensibilities. Unfortunately, I'm quite disappointed with this release. It seems to lack the passion and instrumental mastery that I've heard on previous albums. The singing style is absent the usual power, texture, and depth.  The arrangements are pedestrian. The musicianship is routine and uninspiring. Nowhere in this collection of songs do I hear a moment that makes me think, \\"Mmmmm, delicious!\\", the way I've reacted to her material in the past.  In my opinion, this makes a great collection of lullabyes. I suppose everyone has off-days . . .
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I just bought Keith Urban's New CD Defying Gravity....and it is terrific! Right now there is so much stress in the world and Keith's new CD is joyous, uplifting and just plain fun to listen to.  There are plenty of up beat songs perfect for dancing or working out, some beautiful love songs that will melt your heart and of course one signature Keith song especially written for his wife Nicole.  This CD will make country fans happy but really it's so contemporary that I think anyone who appreciates great lyrics, good melodies and killer guitar playing will appreciate it.  Amazon has a great price on it...so what do you have to lose!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a very fun & even educational game.  What makes it so much fun is that it's never the same turnout twice!  Well done and got it for a great deal too! thanks.
0143038419|5.0|This book came along at just the right time for me and I became engrossed in it.  Well, true to my personality, I became engrossed in the \\"extreme\\" sections - Italy and India.  It took me a while to come back and finish Indonesia, but I was very glad that I did and yes, I think I could benefit from more balance.  This book touched me intensely, so much so, that I hate recommending it to other people and I often don't - it just felt like too personal an experience to send anyone else towards.  If they are looking for this type of memoir, they will find this book.  If they are not looking, then I suspect that it is not for them at this time.    There are plenty of reviews that give you the recap of the story, I wanted to try and recap the experience.
0767817710|5.0|I loved this version of The Quick and the Dead, even though it's the only version I've seen, lol. Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe, Gene Hackman, and Leonardo DiCaprio are spectacular and are the right fit for the characters in this movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I consider myself in pretty athletic shape and this video was still a challenge.  She really gets a great workout in 20 minutes!  I couldn't be happier because I now have a back up plan for those days I can't make it to the gym or don't have a whole heck of a lot of time to invest in my workout.  I love that she is not cheesy like some can be! This video works all parts...arms, abs, legs...I love it!
B00007AJGH|5.0|I got exactly what I ordered & I am 110& satisfied! I look forward to ordering more in the future!
0312323867|5.0|This was the flip version of Something Borrowed which was also good. This version was a lot more interesting to read as had a lot of twists and turns and unexpected events.  You were never sure what would happen next even if you thought you had it figured out.  It was really hard to put down and was great for a rainy Saturday to sit around in pj's and enjoy the journey this book took you through..
0374139563|1.0|We need more books on how to improve and reform development, but this is an unsubstantiated rant calling to cut off aid in five years. Everyone needs aid and should work together to improve the global well-being as a whole. The author's suggestions aren't just radical, they're baseless and dangerous. The solution she proposes is that the free market will bail out Africa almost overnight. Right now, we can't get the free market to work in the US let alone pull off a miracle in Africa.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This is Keith best CD to date!!! If you are a fan you will love this CD, and if your not at Keith fan yet, you will be after you hear this CD.  It has something for everyone!!!
045122499X|5.0|If I didn't know better, I'd swear that a couple of Follett's more manipulative clerics were plotting to accuse him of witchcraft. After all, his novels cast a spell. Once you're in, you can't get out; you are hopelessly in thrall. While this addictive excellence distinguishes all his books, the Kingsbridge duo are most powerful of all. Beware, oh Gentle Reader: There is no escape. Nor antidote. And that's the problem: Once you've read the Kingsbridge duo, where do you go? I've read the Sir Walter Scotts and Thomas B Costains. The Sharon Kay Penmans and the Edward Rutherfurds... some of which were better than others. I could go on, but you get the picture. Follett's left me stuck in medieval England, without an amazon.com list to insure my survival there. What do I read now?
B000X2H8G4|3.0|Does amplify the sound so you don't annoy the neighbors watching t.v. late into the night.  Of course it picks up other sounds as well which can be disturbing.  Can't avoid that.  But for the price, I am not complaining much.
032147404X|5.0|I ordered this first book in the series after reading the second one. This is the better of the two. I am new to digital photography but some of the tips in this book have helped me avoid some common mistakes. For example, don't shot down on flowers, don't cut off joints or how to use light or dark backgrounds to shoot flowers. This book helps with deciding on what camera lens to use explaining the use of filters and basic issues that the beginner or even expert may have overlooked. A must have book!
B000006045|5.0|Last review was in 2000. That was nine years ago. Still listen to this album with veneration, never get tired of it. The next album released by these guys, after Mezzanine, is completely different and for some reason or other I can't digest it, it's rather boring.   I wonder if that's why they sort of quitted.
B000W4KT64|5.0|This was great!  I have always loved the movie and couldn't wait to see John Travolta play mom.  My girls loved the Zac Efron aspect.  I was not at all surprised that I loved this one as much as all of the other versions that I have seen and now I feel like my kids have seen just one of those movies that you should definately see in your life.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|I am a huge Diana fan.  I've driven hundreds of miles to see her in concert, and have almost all her CD's. First off, I am a HUGE bossa nova fan, and I love the collection of songs she chose for this release.  I was so excited to receive it, as I had pre-ordered it before the sample songs were available before purchasing.  I knew it would be great: bossa nova, great songs, and Diana at the helm.  Had I been able to preview the songs first, I never would have purchased it.  What happened to her great piano solos?  what happened to her saultry, bouncy voice?  She has taken every song and turned them into a sleeper.  I am so disappointed in this one.  Every song seems to have the same tempo--slow.  This sure is not a toe-tapper.  It is something I will listen to when I'm feeling like relaxing and having a good nap.
B00005M91K|5.0|A mesmerizing experience of life and cultures!  A must see for everyone, especially the documentary enthusiast.
140120841X|3.0|Verily, this Vichyssoise of Verbiage Veers Most Verbose...    A rare instance where I heartily enjoyed the movie more. While both have their problems I found those in the movie to be ultimately more bearable, if only for the fact that it's two hours and you're done. Also the Wachowski's rewrote the fascism story in the movie to coincide a little more closely with the Bush era. Interestingly enough, the problems with both the book and the movie are directly inverted.    Where the movie used cliche to fill in complex gaps, the graphic novel was too complex in parts that ultimately should have been simple exposition. As I understand it this is one of Alan Moore's earlier works and, while a lot of what people love about him is here, there are whole scenes (3-4 pages) where characters pontificate about their various ideologies while nothing else is going on but for them walking from one room to another. I felt as though Moore was so anxious to explain the merit's of his personal philosophy (I hear he's a anarchist, socialist, wizard in real life (check the picture of him here!)) that he lets telling a good story slide too much.    This didn't happen in Watchmen for example. There was never a moment where I felt someone was monologue-ing for the writers sake and thus breaking character. When Ozymandius goes on a tangent about his evil plans in the end, it is as it should be, and not interrupting the flow of the story.    There is brilliance here of course ad it's more of a 3.5 than a 3 for me but Watchmen was for superior and...I feel guilty for speaking such sacrilege ... but I found the movie to be a little better told than this was.
0156034026|5.0|this book led to one of the best discussions our book club has ever had. It was like an abstract painting that led each person to differnet discoveries and questions.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This is a must have for any KU fan and if you aren't a fan buy it anyway and you'll become a fan.  I've listened to the CD several times but cannot pick a favorite song yet because I love them all.  I cannot wait to \\"Escape\\" with Keith and see these new songs live!
0743298039|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It draws from lots of great stories, many clearly referenced within the book, but everything was fresh, original, and engrossing. I'm not often a mystery reader, but I thought this was great. Setterfield presented enough suggestions to get me thinking but never entirely certain of how things all fit. And when things were revealed or did fall into place it was entirely satisfying. While parts of it were ambiguous, this was done in a way that is satisfying to the reader, leaving us comfortable either with uncertainty or filling in our own assumptions.
B001ILFUDM|3.0|I really expected more from a Blu-Ray release.  Though the PQ and Audio was as good as you can get for a film that's been released for almost 70 years.  I was very disappointed with the film not being able to fit a widescreen TV and would have to include side curtains to cover the side borders.
B000002GYW|5.0|You can't go wrong with the Eagles as this album shows how they became one of the premier bands of all time.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Slumdog is a great underdog story.  It follows the life of a boy, Jamal, who grows up on the streets in India along with his older brother and a young girl, Latika, whom they take under their care.  They face horrible treatment including barely escaping being maimed so that they could earn more as beggars for the men who are their \\"keepers\\".  They all become separated but Jamal never forgets Latika.  He finds her a couple of times only to lose her again.  Knowing that \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\"  is one of her favorite shows, Jamal earns a spot on the broadcast so that hopefully Latika will see him and he will be able to find her again.  As the questions are asked on the gameshow, Jamal remembers his life and how it is that he knows all the right answers.  He is suspected of cheating because no one believes a lower caste slumdog could be smart enough to answer all the questions correctly.  It's a beautiful movie in which right wins over might and good triumphs over evil.  It's a modern day Rocky.  The movie does contain some violence and profanity.  It is not for children under 12 at least.  Don't miss out on this movie.
B00155GDXC|5.0|This took a while to get going, as it's an unusual voice.  You feel like you're watching a one-man show, as the character describes the setting, what the others in the theatre are doing, etc. Soon, however, you're so drawn in, this becomes an all-night read.<br />Hamid writes of a Pakistani Princeton graduate who is offered a top position in the business world. Then 9/11 happens, and this perfect world he's been invited to join reveals cracks...too many of them.  It's a fascinating story.
B000PXVXVW|4.0|I like the fact that this is not just a boyish or girl-ly color and can use that as an education toys for kid. It is great that comes with toys, too. I recently bought couple for my friends' kids (3 and 4 years old)and they love them. Good way to teach numbers and time.  I am not sure about it the watch last for a long time or being extremely accurate. The reality is for $15, I get an education toy for a child. No compliants at all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow! Jillian is amazing! Even her beginner's workout kicks my BUTT! She is awesome. Have faith, friends and fans. Follow Jillian. She will get you into shape. Don't expect it to be easy.  Anything worth having is rarely ever easy to obtain, but Jillian can get you the bod you have been wanting... or missing. :)
B0001WTVUW|5.0|A dynamite film, really makes you think about what COULD have happened. I always wondered why the network never re-ran this movie. My wife missed it in '83 because of a night class she had. She only had to wait 26 years to finally see it. It was just as good the second time around. The impact of these images is almost too intense to describe. You really have to see it to appreciate it.
B00000DOZE|5.0|Great Service. It came in a blink of an eye. It was in excellent shape and easy listening.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I received my movie in great shape and was very pleased with my purchase.  I highly recommend this vendor.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|Great re-issue of possibly the greatest album from the 90's.  The remix CD is great, but the bonus DVD of the live MTV Unplugged is worth the price of the package alone - catching the band at their heyday back when there was only one MTV station still and they played music some of the time.  Great 5.1 mix on the show too.
1569242739|5.0|My brother's girlfriend brought the Cookies n Cream cupcakes over for his birthday, and they were heavenly!!! So far I made the Pineapple right-side up cupcakes, and they were amazing!

B001PPGAIA|5.0|Very good movie. If you want to see Hugh Jackman use his Australian accent then this is the movie you've got to see.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana Krall sings \\"Quiet NIghts\\" with a such tender passion with her sultry voice.  Her fingers on her piano takes over when her voice is quiet.  We can feel what she feels when she plays the piano and beutifully lets us know how she feels through her piano notes.  The sultry voice I do not have to tell you how it sounds.    I loved the whole CD and every song she sung!  Each song has a special meaning to me!  ..  This truly is a different Diana in Rio than I have heard before.  For me I love her choice of all the songs, the words in the songs and how she sings them.  I just want to sit quietly and listen to each word of the song and enjoy them over and over again.  .. I know you will appreciate this DVD as I have! ! !  Diana, our family was the way yours was - music playing in our homes - filled with beautiful sounds.  We yet have some of our have piano players left and a violinist but no singers (although my sister and I would love to sing a song)!  Goog Luck with this DVD and enjoy this great time in your life with your children and husband.   Again, thank you!!   Ellen

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I lost my cassette along the way and never bother to buy it again. Recently the song came on radio and it reminded me that must buy this and cherish it for ever. There are updated versions as well, but I am happy with the original version.
0930289234|5.0|This is the 4th copy that my family has purchased.  I bought this to read  myself (I'm 56 years old) and my son's girlfriend borrowed it right after I received it.  Then my daughter borrowed it for her co-worker.<br />I don't mind because I'm in the middle of another book right now, but I can't give a review other than my kids (under 30 years old) and their friends love it.

B001K3JF7K|4.0|Diana's voice could be better, but the initiative is outstanding particularly with the one I consider as being the greatest in strings arrangement. This record has the flavor of a revisited Jobim and Claus Ogerman album with a voice sometime lacking sensation, vibes, breathing and the tone of a brazilian voice like Eliane Elias or Gal costa. Actually, Eliane with the album \\"DREAMER\\" has been singing with piano playing and a smaller but sound and balanced orchestral flavor at least one of the selection of that Diana album with a different and better soul expression which is the real essence of Brasil as we always do expect. At least 3 selections do not deserve the dimension of Ogerman and should be left to the song writers. Fortunately because of the painting, the music is not boring as Claus for me is the superstar of that Great album. The music \\"Every time we say good bye\\" which is one of the favorite by Billy Holiday baptizes Claus Ogerman as a modern, unique and a divine inspiration never seen with any arranger and reconfirm Diana as tasty as we knew her before. A great album for real fan of good music and great arrangement. Listen to it lightly after a glass of wine in a quiet night and you surely will tell something about it.

B0001US62I|1.0|Horrible, nasty.  Why is film with this content found to be \\"entertaining\\"?  Just because it has \\"stars\\" in it, does not mean that is an excuse to accept the degrading, unedifying misogynistic, racist nastiness.  The murder scene at the end is particularly disturbing and leads you to wonder how far civil rights have really come when certain white male film makers, given the chance to portray their fantasies divise this kind of degrading death for the \\"love interest\\" with all its disturbing metaphors.  Perhaps no very far at all.  All involved should be ashamed of partipating in it and the public of bying into nonsense, intellectualising it and allowing people to make money from glamorising oppression.  Identifying with such content is degrading to a viewer who sees this as positive in any way.  If you find this \\"good\\" than you should take a look at yourself.  Why is it ok to \\"feel\\" something when watching a film regardless of what it is?  Why enjoy seeing other people degrade themselves and suffer?  What are films like this doing to us as human beings?  If this is people's idea of fun, hope I don't sit next to you on the train.      I wanted to select no stars whatsoever for this filth but did not know how to do it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This video is good....but tough.  You're supposed to do each level for 10 days.  I get bored after 7 so it's tough to drive myself to do each level for 3 more days before moving on but it is a good workout video and I have seen results.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith Urban is done it again! He never ceases to amaze with his songwriting skills, heartfelt vocals, and passionate guitar work. This time the theme of the CD is love. It's a really fun, upbeat kind of album, perfect for chasing the blues away on a bad day. It's an aural \\"happy pill\\" that the world needs right now in these trying times. \\"Hit the Ground Runnin',\\"  a tune penned by Keiths' bassist Jerry Flowers is a rockin' tune that is most effective when cranked up at full volume. It showcases Jerry as not just a band member but a taletned songwriter in his own right. Keith made an excellent choise when he picked that song. \\"My Heart is Open\\" is another favorite about being brave enough despite past heartbreak to take a chance on love again. \\"Kiss a Girl,\\" the current single, has a similar theme, but it's the kind of catchy tune you find yourself singing along to and tapping your fingers on the steering wheel when it comes on the radio in the car! \\"Thank You\\" is a very personal song, a confessional about his past struggles and a loving tribute to his wife. \\"Standing Right in Front of You\\" is another favorite, an uptempo song about a boy wishing the girl he sees every day would just notice him and make the first move. I could go on and on about this album, but you get the idea. Go out and buy it...you'll be glad you did! It's definitely going to be a fun CD to play in the summer, and it makes me even more excited to see how these songs come alive in concert.
044024367X|1.0|The concept of Jack Reacher is pretty simple.  He's big, he's strong, and he's mean.  This book clearly strayed from the formula.  The formula in and of itself has become a little ridiculous as well - made sense when Reacher was fresh out of the Army, but now he's a bum and a drifter.  He has a toothbrush, but never buys toothpaste.  He wears the same clothes day after day after day but still pulls the chicks?  Really?  He's gone from tough guy to loser.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|This is a really good movie, but I do not recommend buying this DVD at the retail price. If you can get it discounted or buy it used, then that would be the route to go.    I don't think this will be any kind of collector's item.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|\\"Pinocchio\\" is generally considered Disney's masterpiece. Visually there's no denying it. It's nothing if not lavish, in a way that no other animated film has duplicated (though \\"Fantasia\\" and \\"Bambi\\" approach it). The underwater scenes inspired the filming of \\"The Little Mermaid\\", though it doesn't come within light years of its inspiration.<br /><br />I've been waiting for an opportunity to criticize \\"Pinocchio\\", as it epitomizes what was so /wrong/ with Disney's approach to story telling. Disney wasn't afraid to show things that frightened - even terrorized -- children, * but he backed away from confronting serious dramatic issues.<br /><br />We see this thoughout \\"Pinocchio\\". It starts when Jiminy Cricket starts to explain the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. Instead of a terse, focused explanation, he fumbles and bumbles. (\\"Fumfers\\" might be the apt word.)<br /><br />Why? Because a \\"straight\\" explanation wouldn't be \\"entertaining\\". That was one of Disney's rules -- \\"Make it entertaining\\". And entertaining didn't include a serious discussion of moral or social issues.<br /><br />It wouldn't have been difficult to add weight and meaning to Jiminy's explanation, without turning him into a film-stopping talking head: \\"What's bad? What's wrong? It's when you think only about yourself, when you put what /you/ want ahead of what's right for other folks.\\"<br /><br />This is hardly a deep discussion of the matter, but it covers a great deal of human history! And it more-clearly sets up the conflict between what Pinocchio wants to do and ought to do.<br /><br />This backing-off occurs again, near the end, when Gepetto asks Pinocchio about his ears and tail. Pinocchio coyly refuses to answer, instead of saying \\"I was punished for being selfish and bad\\". Isn't being truthful one of the requirements for becoming a real boy?<br /><br />\\"Pinocchio\\" has other problems. Of The Big Five, it's the most poorly paced. Though the opening sequence spends a lot of time introducing the characters (as it should), there are a few sections where I'd like to yell \\"Get on with it!\\". Ditto for Honest John's examination of Pinocchio's health, which does little to advance the story, existing mostly for its visual humor. It was a great day at Disney when a talented writer (Linda Woolverton) was hired to write coherent scripts.<br /><br />We now come to the issue of the quality of the Blu-ray transfer. Some people have condemned it, arguing that the new edition is a gross distortion of the original film. (There is a lengthy discussion attached to Jon Olivan's review; those interested in this issue should read it.)<br /><br />I have both the 1993 LaserDisk and the new Blu-ray edition. Both are billed as \\"restorations\\", but the latter looks completely different. While the LV version has a generally warm, \\"artistic\\", \\"Old Masters\\" look (almost certainly what Disney wanted), the Blu-ray (and DVD) have lost most of the warmth, and have been cleaned up to the point of occasionally looking \\"sterile\\". **<br /><br />Then there is the matter of saturation. Though the actual hues aren't any different, almost all colors are brighter and more vivid. Disney did not want a lot of bright colors in his animated features, so we can be reasonably sure this was not his intent. The 2009 edition's colors are more like those of an animated short subject. The stills at the beginning of the Amazon page for the Blu-ray disk give a pretty good idea of what it looks like.<br /><br />The cause of this change is not clear. Some of it is likely due to the direct transfer from the original three-strip Technicolor negatives (though I believe the same system was used with the 1993 edition). It might also be a conscious tampering, to make the film more appealing to the presumed tastes of the viewers.<br /><br />Regardless, it's highly likely that the Blu-ray disk /does not/ represent the artistic intent of the film's creators. If you have an earlier edition of \\"Pinocchio\\",I wouldn't toss it. And the new edition has its own pleasures, including the ability to see the magnficent background paintings in all their glory. And they are pretty glorious.<br /><br />* When his daugther asked why Bambi's mother had to die, he told her \\"That's the way nature is.\\" Fifteen years later, he'd softened to the point where he let Peggy Lee talk him out of killing Trusty in \\"Lady in the Tramp\\".<br /><br />** Which is not to deny that the earlier edition sometimes looks downright grundgy.magnficent background paintings in all their glory.

B000068OCS|5.0|Having seen this film in a movie theater with a live performance of the score by Philip Glass and his musicians right there on stage... I can say this DVD doesn't capture the experience, what with it's not so glamorous picture quality. But until the inevitable Blu-ray comes on the market, this is the best we've got and it's fairly good. The colors are vivid and there aren't too many defects. The picture does need some clean-up work. The source would greatly benefit from a high-def remaster.    Koyaanisqatsi is quite an original film, having influenced everything from television ads, music videos, nature documentaries and even feature length Hollywood movies. The film is all about pulse and movement conveyed by the time lapse editing style it made famous.    It's style and essence has been ripped off so many times during the nearly three decades since it came out, that it's easy to take Koyaanisqatsi for granted. But going back to the original is always thrilling and I don't think there has ever been a better film of it's type.    The film and it's director, Godfrey Reggio, have been criticized for being preachy. I think these criticisms are partially valid for this film but far more valid for the subsequent installments of the trilogy. Reggio and Glass give an insightful interview which can be found on the special features that goes into Reggio's background and how they collaborated on this film.    Koyaanisqatsi starts off slow and some of the nature photography tends to drag, but things take off as humanity comes on the scene and the final portions of the film reach a fever pitch that neither Reggio, nor his later imitators ever captured again. The score by Philip Glass is a classic of sorts in modern film scoring. Glass' minimalism can become quite grating on it's own but with the constant visual onslaught, it meshes rather well. Glass would become a big name in film scoring afterwards and he's been repeating the same style for decades.     This is another example of a classic film that would be a showcase in high-def. So a message to whoever currently owns the rights, get moving and bring Koyaanisqatsi to Blu-ray! And do a proper job of it too!
1401923119|4.0|I think the implications of Lipton's book are very deep indeed. His scientific background make this book more credible than it would otherwise have been. I strongly recommend the book to anyone with an interest in such matters - either biology or belief systems.     The only weakness is that Lipton builds a very strong case for a new way of considering the body and how it works, but then he leaps with much less rigour into the implications on belief.     Notwithstanding this, Lipton's biological perspective provides enormous \\"evidence\\" for a different book 'Fountainhead: Principles of the Soul\\" that speaks convincingly on a radically different belief system. The two are wonderfully complementary.
1878424505|4.0|Don Miguel shares sacred traditions which can be adopted as a way of life, if happiness and love are what we desire.  He explains the fog which many times blur our vision to what is actually occurring and keeps us away from the joy we deserve.  His four agreements are simple to understand but of course difficult to put in play, but not impossible!    If we can control our emotions through our personal power, we can change our fear-based agreements and live a life of freedom and love.  To do this we must be aware of what we think, say, and do, and when we do our best, we will move towards other people in a helpful and loving manner.  Don Miguel shares the \\"New Dream\\" and it is one many of us dream of as well.  Inspiration comes from within and this book helps us find our insight in our own way.
B001VSZ7RQ|5.0|Yet another great CD from Keith Urban.  So much fun and so upbeat.  My absolute favorite songs are Kiss A Girl and Thank You.  You can't go wrong buying this CD.
B001KL3GWM|3.0|D. C. Wilks' review is a good summary.  This is definitely DTB's least ambitious effort to date, but it is every bit as soulful as the past efforts - if not more, in some respects.  Unfortunately, the album is lacking somewhat in the band's usually progressive musicianship, and focuses more on accessibility, with more vocals and more conventional song structures.      Kofi's role seems to gradually wane with each of the last few albums, and the complete absence of flute on this recording is disappointing.  In fact, several band members lay out on multiple tracks (in stark contrast with the last, very \\"band-oriented\\" album), although the results are not all bad.  \\"Back Where I Started\\", sung by Tedeschi, finds Trucks again dabbling with sarod, and is easily worth the purchase price of the entire album.      Although there's nothing absolutely essential here (unlike \\"Madness\\", \\"Soul Serenade\\", \\"Joyful Noise\\", \\"GA Theatre\\" & even \\"Songlines\\"), the album has a very simple, homey, bluesy, soulful, casual, & fundamentally enjoyable feel throughout, and any DTB fan will want to pick up a copy.  I'd look at this album as a well-earned \\"breather\\" in Derek's generally ambitious catalogue - with the magnum opus probably still to come.
B001NE80P4|4.0|There are worse things my daughter could obsess about than the High School Musical series.  The singing and dancing are top notch and the storylines are romantic in a sweet, childlike way.  The movies are basically about making friends and having fun.  The third and final installment has the added plus of emphasizing the importance of picking a college and growing up to be a thoughtful and productive member of society.  I like the broad characterizations and don't mind over-the-top antics in the musical genre.  They seem to fit quite well against a backdrop of spontaneous musical outbursts.<br /><br />And for those of us who are not preteens, that Zac Efron kid is something else.  I know he's young, but he has the magnetism of someone who is not jailbait.  So while I'm still unable to tolerate Hannah Montanna and her brethern, I'm okay with what director Kenny Ortega has created in the HSM World.  If only High School really had been that sweet and melodic.
0061339202|4.0|This book explains what optimal experiences are and how they relate to the psychology of happiness. This book also provides some intriguing definitions for consciousness, attention, and intention, which I think are useful in reconsidering how to purposely use such elements of our behavior to prompt flow. It's a good book overall, with the author providing some excellent examples of how people have used flow states to overcome adversity as well as create works of genius. It also presents some psychological theory which isn't rooted in Freud, Jung, or the eight circuit model, which is refreshing to read, and much needed in order to better appreciate psychology as a discipline and how that discipline can be related to one's spirituality.<br /><br />If there's one area where this book suffers, it's that the author is sometimes too wordy and overly repetitious. While I enjoyed this book, there were times, I felt the author was repeating himself too much, in order to get a point across. That said, it's definitely worth picking up, to broaden your understanding of psychology and optimal states of experience.
0765315246|4.0|John Scalzi no doubt pays some inspiration from Heinlein for this military-oriented SF-style book thus its feel of having a retro-feel with some contemporary updates in sensibilities. Entertaining and breezy I read it over a few days so it is a good time filler. The central character is likeable and the emotive content is well balanced with the action. The humour is good ol' american style \\"wry\\" so I laughed a few times though I wonder if it was in the parts intended to be funny? That question is rhetorical by the way. The background to the central thrust of the story is undeveloped and vague but I assume that's intentional so that the character development is not over-shadowed. The characters feel too contemporary considering its the future by at least 2 centuries..again not a uncommon aspect of many science fiction novels..however the tendency seems more apparent for some authors than others. I still think authors should try and write speculative novels with more social/cultural advancement in mind rather than extrapolating just technology and space politics, but that's my opinion. The technology-aspect of the novel (the \\"science\\" bit) is any case nothing special but is handled adroitly as a device to drive the story forward. Overall, an above average effort and worth reading (***1/2).
B00003CX7L|5.0|Rarely do I find a movie that enthralls me, keeps my attention throughout, and has a perfect ending, but I've found all this in Toy Story 2. My family loved Toy Story. But the sequel is even better. Never a dull moment. I would highly recommend TS2 for anyone aged 2 to 92. An absolutely wonderful movie!
0062502182|5.0|This was a very inspiring story about a shephard boy who follows his destiny and all of the obstacles he encounters along the way. It teaches us that we all have a \\"personal legend\\" and that if we follow the signs we will be sure to accomplish what we set out to do. I would recommend this book to anyone especially those who feel their life is starting down a path that seems unwanted or unfamiliar. It will help you to refocus and set out to do what you have always dreamed of doing.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire won Best Picture of the Year for a reason. It's incredible. Very dramatic, but touching, hopeful and redemptive.
006085880X|5.0|Wow. This book was incredibly difficult to put down. It's one of those books where you start reading and then all the sudden an hour has passed. It's very easy to get into. Jodi Picoults novel, The Pact, is about a teenage couple who seem to be inseperable. Chris and Emily have known eachother since Emily was born, 3 months after Chris. Their mothers are best friends and have been since they were both pregnant. Chris and Emily are neighbors and were always attached at the hip since they could walk. Their parents had always expected (and hoped) that one day their friendship would turn into something more. Eventually, it did. They weren't like any normal couple for their age. Their relationship was very unique. They were simply nothing without the other. Then all the sudden one night Emily and Chris are rushed to the hospital, Emily with a bullet in her head, and Chris with a head wound from fainting. Chris is arrested for the murder of Emily Gold, but he claims they were going to both commit suicide together, though he fainted after seeing Emily first. The facts aren't lining up and everyone knows there is more to Chris's story. but he loved Emily, why would he want to kill her?   I definitely recommend this book for anyone who is a Picoult fan. So far, this book is tied at the top of my list along with Handle With Care. I didnt get a chance to, but I would have been able to read this book easily in one sitting.

B001RLP862|5.0|These are better than Copac cards and I would almost say as good if not better than Kem's!<br />For $10 a deck, you cant go wrong.<br />They are crease proof (no more marking the Aces!), thick plastic with a rough like finish.<br />They are pretty slick, might take some getting used to at first to shuffle.<br />For a serious home card game, these cards are highly recommended, you will not be disappointed at all.
B001F12J0C|4.0|I am happy with this set as opposed to the crazy collectors edition.  Its small, well put together and all 3 great movies.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|It's often very difficult to create a movie worthy of a great novel, but I believe this movie does its source material proud.  Winslet is a revelation as the the enigma Hanna, make no mistake about it, this is a very complex character to pull off.  Much has been made of the nudity in the first half of this film, but I thought it was true to the character of Hanna.  Though the Holocaust is the pink elephant in the room, this really is not a \\"Holocaust\\" film, I mean to say, it's not Schindler's List or The Piano.  This at times is not an easy film to like, but I recommend it highly as a steller adapation of a great book.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|I was skeptical when I heard that this movie would be produced by Luc Besson (The Professional, La Femme Nikita), the go to man or the French Joel Silver of action movies since some of his films have been hit and miss.  This turns out to be a hit (it's already grossed $143 million thus far) thanks to the casting of Liam Neesom (Schindler's List; Rob Roy).  A physically imposing actor of great presence, Neesom brings this physicality to the role of an retired CIA man brought back into action when his daughter is kidnapped in Paris.  What ensues is 97 minutes of breakneck action and Neesom is totally convincing in this role.  It may lack the complexity of the Bourne series but if you like your action movies to be lean and mean--this is the flick to see!!
1416914307|1.0|I have tried my hardest to give Clare the benefit of the doubt, but in the end, this book just got on my nerves. Clare's writing has barely improved, if at all, over the course of three long books.    Every \\"surprise\\" plot twist is obvious from a mile away.    As if the first two books weren't derivative enough, City of Glass sinks even lower. I could only think to myself: \\"I've seen this done before and it was done better - in Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Angel Sanctuary.\\" (On that note, I have no idea what a nine-year-old boy is doing reading Angel Sanctuary in the first place. Sense, Clare, do you have it?)    The worst part? The whole book was dull. At some point, I just stopped caring about all the characters completely. (Except for Jace and Clary, who continued to aggravate me to no end with their teenage wangst.)    I hope Clare improves after this for the sake of her fans (who deserve better), but I can't say I'll ever bother to pick up any of her books again.

B0013K1ALE|5.0|Where to begin? This is FILM. If you can't tell video from film, you need to do some homework. This film shows Peter Grant, Roy Harper, the bands' families, many people whom have passed away, divorced, or just disappeared. If you don't know Zep well, this won't help, but if you understand Aleister Crowley, the arts, the seventies, and magic, this will click unlike the VIDEO TAPE of later items. Younger fans will probably not understand, but for those of us who WERE THERE, nothing like the real thing. May you find the occult experience and humor in this film rewarding, it's there, IF you have the eyes/ears for it.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|Whew!  I just finished watching \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" for the first time.  I'd hedged at watching it because I haven't had great luck with Indian films (though [[ASIN:B000U2U0E4 The Namesake]] is pretty good).<br /><br />What should you know if you haven't seen this film yet, and you are trying to decide whether you should see it?  Here are a few thoughts:<br /><br />1) The film is set in Mombai, India<br />2) There are images of extreme poverty, including use and implied abuse of children, especially of orphans<br />3) There is portrayal of religious-based violence<br />4) There is street violence<br />5) The storyline is compelling, and you find it difficult to look away<br />6) The characters seem genuine, and the acting is good overall<br />7) You will find the cinematography and the casting to be outstanding<br /><br />To be frank, I didn't know what to expect when we started watching this film.  Just a few minutes into the film we sent our 10-yr old to another room to do something else while we watched this DVD.  This is NOT a film for children.  The violence and apparent hopeless situation of the children living in Mombai's slums was simultaneously heart-wrenching and exciting.<br /><br />A solid show through and through.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Wow!  \\"Defying Gravity\\" is classic KU w/ a new twist!  \\"Till Summer comes around\\" is the new ballad that will keep you hitting the repeat button-you just can't get enough of this one!

155890641X|5.0|disney movies are desired by anyone with children, especially girls, the problem is they are very difficult to find. i looked in all the major stores for dvds to purchase and asked around, and was always told the same thing, they only come out during certain times, they arent produced anymore etc. so i got the next best thing, vhs. Vhs movies are easy to find online and considerably cheaper than purchasing a dvd. most are used, but in very excellent condition depending upon which seller you choose. i have purchased about 10 disney vhs movies through amazon.com, and am pleased with all. the only thing that is sort of ironic is usually the shipping costs more than the product itself!:P
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I just finished watching Slumdog and the 12 deleted scenes.  I loved every minute of it!  Cried at the same spot through to the ending credits.  If you have a chance to see the deleted scenes, and you enjoyed this movie as much as me, you will find they are excellent additions to the story - including an extended opening to the movie and the original ending that was cut from the film.  Enjoy!!

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Yes, this cd has been out for well over a year and still hasn't gone platinum. Yes, it's been overshadowed my Brit's personal life and her \\"comeback\\" disk Circus. But this album is epic. Every song is great, which is probably one of the reasons why her Circus tour is almost exclusively material from Blackout.     The only thing this cd lacks is a ballad, which is fine by me. Britney excels at club bangers and pop/dance. Leave the ballads to singers with bigger voices, Brit just wants to have fun. And that's why we love her.
0316017922|4.0|This book delivers exactly what it promises.  Malcolm Gladwell is not a scholar.  He does not pretend to be a scholar.  But he is well read and he has a knack for spinning yarns that are educational and entertaining. This book pulls you along well.  It meanders pleasantly through several factors that go into making people great successes. Some of these factors will surprise no one, but I suspect most will find some surprises in its pages.  I have heard it criticized for ignoring the importance of \\"God given talent\\", and I think that there is validity to that criticism.  Gladwell does not deny the importance of natural talent (e.g., he shows how Canada can produce four times as many hockey stars -- not how all Canadians can become hockey stars).  However, he spends so much time talking about other factors that talent seems to get lost.  I certainly agree with Gladwell's thesis that there is more to success than raw talent and hard work.<br /><br />Like much of Gladwell's writing, the book argues that there are people in life who are given good chances and other people in life who are given very poor chances (and, yes, race and culture certainly play into that distinction).  As one who has the prospect of raising the next generation ahead of me, I find his advice on how to give your children advantages very helpful (no, he does not give the mystic charm to turning a middle aged beer guzzler into the next Bill Gates or Wayne Gretzky).<br /><br />All in all, the book is what it promises: it is an enjoyable read that helps the reader become aware of factors that give rise to certain advantages.  There is room for improvement, but, honestly, the real classics are still outliers.
B0002KVUL6|1.0|... simply put......... rubbish.    The amount of Money spent on this film....... decadently sickening!    The Script....... flawed, flat, numb.    The Direction........ Lame!!!!!    The actors....... tried hard to save it! but failed miserably!    The Computer FX.......... beyond woeful! ....this stretchy, movement blur thing is ruining all the reality of film - give me practical fx anyday! ...you losers who enjoy this green screen fake reality - go play a COMPUTER GAME! Films were meant to be real - sets - locations - special effects = aimed to extend our perception of reality - not this lifeless, dull, gamer orientated rubbish which upon conclusion, really just ends up being disrespectful to the old horror masters they tried to impress!    If someone aims to HOMAGE the classic HORROR films of the golden age of horror - for godsake don't sell out like these fakers....    go buy the original classics and put this where it belongs.... the bin!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Probably the most worthwhile fitness video I have purchased in years! Clear instructions and uncomplicated moves make it easy to follow along even though the workout is tough! I moved from Level 1 to 2 in two weeks of training every other day. Had I done every day, I probably would have progressed faster. Results are there! Thanks Jillian!!
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|I do not understand why there is a voiceover narration in this movie.  It is distracting.  The narrator's voice itself is rather nasal and not at all pleasant on the ears.  It seems as if Woody Allen was attempting to emulate the ironic detachment and science-doc parody narrator of the far superior [[ASIN:B000N3SU92 Little Children]].  He fails.  The voiceover is NEVER used appropriately.  At times, it actually impairs the performance of the actors.  In one scene, for example, it tells us that a character is drunk.  When you hire an Oscar winner like Javier Bardem, it seems safe to assume that he can play drunk convincingly, and that we don't need a narrator to tell us this.  And if for some reason he can't do it, maybe all the empty wine glasses helpfully supplied by the prop department can clue us in.  At other times, the voiceover carries us forward in time, or sets up a scene.  A good writer can accomplish that with a few lines of exposition hidden in the dialogue, and a good director can accomplish it with a montage or some nifty editing.  If I could ask Woody Allen one question about this movie, it would be why he suddenly felt he wasn't equal to that task, and instead needed this wholly intrusive narrator to do his job for him.<br /><br />Narration aside, I enjoyed the film.  It's just a fun, frothy, frisky romp though the Spanish countryside.  The background is even more attractive than the cast.  The premise is a little trite and the characters are paper-thin, but it certainly met my entertainment quotient, and my expectations.  This in spite of the fact that, as is apparently usual with Woody Allen's DVD releases, there are zero extras.<br /><br />Oh, and as for that recent Oscar win?  Penelope Cruz didn't deserve it.  Her performance is all flash -- no substance, and no heart.

0143113100|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I've read recently.  Written for laymen, it has compelling stories backed by scientific research.  It showed to me that my inadequacies are learned: I can't do maths, mental arithmetic, lateral parking, blah, blah....are just feeble excuses.  I now know I can change.  Now, where did I store that huge amount of willpower? :-)
0316776963|1.0|I really did not like this book.  As a matter of fact, I couldn't finish reading it.  I tried more than once, thinking I would begin to enjoy it but I just couldn't read it to the end.  Sorry for the poor report.  It certainly was not my cup of tea.
0307265730|5.0|As a devotee of young Indian authors I rate this book as one of the very best. It provides a touching, poignant, extremely well written insight into the lives, minds and challenges of Bengali immmigrants. Highly recommended
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I am a longtime fan. I have all his CDs but unfortunately, Keith is not very well known in his original home country New Zealand. I am spreading the word to get his name out there. I saw him in concert in Brisbane, Australia May 2007 and I will be heading that way again for his Defying Gravity Tour! He is too good and I will not miss his show for anything As for the new album - I can't wait till I have it in my hands. It's coming soon..but had to buy it overseas. All the previews sound wonderful!    UPDATE - I love the album - know all the words to the songs. Got my concert tickets for Dec 19th - his final show of the whole tour - 7th row from the front!! Woohoo!!!
B000N3ST7A|5.0|This album combines Stevie's solo hits with Fleetwood Mac hits. Not all of her great solo hits or Fleetwood Mac hits are on here, but this a really good Solo Greatest Hits package.    What makes this package especially interesting are the live recordings of Rhiannon and Landslide. Also included is the original version of Silver Springs, which was left off Fleetwood Mac's rumours album. It's been remastered and sounds terrific. There are also two versions of Edge of Seventeen, the original and live version recorded with the Melbourne orchestra. Plus, it's chalk full of her great solo hits such Leather and Lace, Stand Back, Rooms on Fire, Talk to Me, Stop Dragging My Heart Around...    It's a terrific package and is better than her other greatest hits album Timespace.
B00006M183|5.0|I bought this as birthday gift for my husband.  Pearl Jam is all he listens to.  He loves it.
B00102FELM|5.0|First of all,I can't stop listening to this DVD!  I love live shows DVDs and I have quite a few of them in my DVD library.Scorpions Live at Wacken is probably one one the best live DVDs I came across in awhile.The song selection is great ,26 of them with special appearance of Herman Rarebell,Uli Jon Roth and Michael Schenker.    First thing you notice about this DVD is great sound;heavy and hard ,just as it should be.The next thing is that the band is really tight and every song is performed well.  It seems that Scorpions really benefit here from having younger guns James Kottak and Pawel Maciwoda,delivering rhytm section while original  masters Rudolph Schenker ,Mathhias Jabs and Klaus Meine deliver their magic.  The performance of opening 3 tracks Coming Home,Bad boys Running wild and The Zoo are best live recording of these 3 tracks ever and are worth buying this DVD for.  The rest of DVD spreads nicely in their earlier and later work with speacial appearance of the above mentioned musicians.  Every member of Scorpions shines on this DVD and thats a nice break from other live DVDs in my library.    I listen to many different styles of music,and have attended many different music genre concerts but Scorpions concert which I attended two years ago was probably one of the best hard rock concerts I have seen!Do yourself a favour and go see them next time they come to your town,you will be happy you did!
B0011UF79C|4.0|Overall I think this is an excellent movie! It is interesting, the acting is good, and I really like the movie.     I have only two complaints:    1- The movie could be longer. This is more of a good thing, because it means that I would like to see more of it. It really was interesting.    2- It sort of seems that the budget wasn't very big for the movie. If this movie was ever remade, the only thing I think they should do differently is make it even more futuristic. The cars look like regular cars, in fact even older, but they just make a humming noise to sound like they are advanced. Didn't like that detail. Other aspects of the movie are a little low budget.    I know I should be looking into the meaning of the movie instead of the flashiness (or lack there off) but I'm just saying it would have been 5 out of 5 stars if they followed those two points.       Bottom line; BUY IT! or at least rent it, because it is an excellent movie.
B000TSIK14|5.0|This is my favourite Scorpions album up to date.  Scorpions reinvent themselves here with new updated sound which is darker and heavier while keeping the melodies softer when songs call for it,without being cheesy.  The band sounds really good with thundering drum work of James Kottak and bass guitar Pawel Maciwoda,heavy and melodic guitars by Mathhias Jabs and Rudy Schenker while Klaus Meine vocals stay flawless.  Songs Hour 1,Game of Life,The Cross and title track Humanity stand out,but there is no fillers here,every song is amazing.  Well done Scorpions!  Looking forward to Humanity Hour II
0596101996|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to learn JavaScript, and it is doing just that!!! There is so much stuff packed into this book that it is amazing, and I can't believe I only payed $32 for it! It covers everything you need to know. It goes into more detail about JavaScript than any book on any other language I have seen. And all the pages are not little flashy examples. It is a real reference for those who are serious about learning JS.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|What a bummer - Diana tries to be a sultry big band singer - singing barely above a whisper - no energy - it doesn't work. What a contrast to her two excellent recordings \\"Live in Paris\\" and \\"When I Look Into Your Eyes\\". Save your money and buy these two. She should fire the individuals who were responsible for this turkey. I'll be very wary of her future offerings.
B001FB55MG|5.0|This is a great family film...funny for everyone and family safe!  I thought this movie was way under-rated...You must see it!
1400082773|5.0|A man that can put more than 3 words together.  A fascinating story from the President of the United States before he was president.  Precise, humorous, informative, etc. A great read.
B001E95ZI8|5.0|enjoyable to watch movie, a lot of fun..great actors' play.. been very pleased watching the movie
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Like most everyone commenting on Diana's latest musical offering, I am a huge and devoted fan -  When she is on - she is just the best. However this CD does not show her true talent.  It sounds like something I heard in the elevator the other day.  Just a bunch of old war horses with very little feeling or passion.  And the one finger piano playing is a joke to anyone that knows that Diana studied jazz piano with the great Jimmy Rowles. And then there are the arrangements of Claus Orgerman - old, muddled, and just plain dull.  OK, Diana you've got to get back to your  jazz roots.  Get some of those talented LA arrangers (I'm thinking of Tom Kubis) - and some of  those \\"A\\" listed studio jazz musicians and do what you do best -- get swingin' again!
0439023483|4.0|I really enjoyed The Hunger Games. Really looking forward to the sequel. It is good for both teens and adults.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|This is a great product for the base of RAM mounts.  If shipping weren't so high it would get 5 stars.
B000005H3M|5.0|Big band swing that shakes around between classic standards and eclectic numbers.  Never staid, fresh workings of each song.  Norweigan Wood is the first track, that gives you an idea of the irreverant atmosphere.  All instrumental except for The Beat Goes On, which is the only track that wears on you after frequent plays.  Outstanding.
0810970686|5.0|I ordered this for my 7 year old grandson.  He is really enjoying it.  I received it promptly and it was in great condition.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers - this is a breathy somewhat slurred, laid back to the point of sleep rendition of these songs.  She really needs a couple of cups of black coffee.  Even her piano playing seems lathargic.  What happened??  Well, if you are having trouble getting to sleep.  Put on this CD you will have dozed off before the midpoint.      I guess I am dissapointed!!
0810970686|5.0|This series is very entertaining for the 10 through 13 age group. Both of my sons have read them all and they truly enjoyed them.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|The new special effects and retouched color of this new \\"remastered\\" version is worth buying this, even if you already have the original release of the first season untouched. The new improves are well done and very beautiful. There are only two flaws that I could find with this DVD. One thing is that the discs are double-sided, and the other being there doesn't seem to be a scene selection menu on the DVD. Since HD-DVD is worthless and not used much, it being two sided makes this hard to handle and easy to get dirty. It would have been better to have had one side be the original version of the series, and the other side be the remastered version. Oh well, no one knew the outcome of the Bluray and HD battle then. This is still well worth buying. Love the updates!
B00000IMTF|5.0|This album just rocks, plain and simple.  This album represents when Rainbow were at their creative best.  Back in 1976 Ronnie James Dio was the lead singer of Rainbow.  In my opinion, he has one of the best voices of all hard rock and heavy metal singers, right behind Robert Plant, Rob Halford, and Bruce Dickinson.  This album also features Cozy Powell on drums, Tony Carey on keyboards, Jimmy Bain on bass, and of course Ritchie Blackmore on guitar.  This album has a lot of spaced-out sounding keyboard mixed with heavy guitar.  The album opens with a long keyboard passage on Tarot Woman.  Rainbow has always had a unique sound for a hard rock band, similar to Deep Purple (which is no surprise), but especially on this album.  The best track by far on this album is Stargazer, followed by Light In The Black.  Stargazer just plain rocks and has great fantasy lyrics.  If you've never gotten into Rainbow before and want to give them a listen, start with this album.  The Dio era was by far the best time of this band's existence.  Buy this.  You won't be disappointed.
B001LF4IA6|3.0|Like his music but I bought this cd for a gift, it's not bad and I like where he's at these days but dont think his fans would rate this as one of his best.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I love this album. There are so many wonderful songs on it. I listen to it at least twice a day some times 3 times a day at work. It's in my car CD player and it runs when ever I'm in the car and I do not have to skip songs to get to the best one because they all are the best.     Everyone knows \\"Sweet Thing\\" and how up beat and happy it it but another along that same vain is \\"Why's it feel so long\\" I love the beat, it  makes me tap my foot and sing along. Some more favorites are \\"I'm In\\" and \\"Kiss a Girl\\", again I just want to sing along to these. The music and lyrics are perfect!    You have to hear \\"If ever I could love\\" it's wonderful and \\"Thank you\\" makes me want to play it to my love and sing along with it to him.    This is one album you want in your collection. It doesn't matter if you're a Keith Urban fan or not. You'll just love the music. I just recently discovered Keith as I'm new to County but he is already one of my favorite performers.
1400034779|5.0|....are the words that come to mind when describing this wonderful little novel.  Precious Ramotswe wants something fun in her life...after a doomed romantic relationship.  When her father dies leaving her a rather sizeable inheritance, Mma Ramotswe decides to open up a detective agency...the only one in her native Botswana.  At first, she is concerned that there will be no clients; but soon the business starts rolling in.  From cheating husbands, to strange physicians to missing children, it is not long before Mma Ramotswe is rather famous in her country.    With generous descriptions of the African country of Botswana, to the local vernacular and customs, Smith has managed to create a beloved protagonist with just the right mixture of wit, drama, and suspense.  Wonderful book.      DYB
1416972242|3.0|Still not really well written. But for some reason it is  still a page turner for me. I am pretty miffed by the ending of this one. But there is one more to go, so a change of redeeming for me. I like the characters  and story line pretty much. It is a little cheesy for lack of a better word. But I'm still reading it anyway. :)Going to get book three today! I would recommend this to certain friends only. Not everyone I know.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Loved the soundtrack!  If you liked the music in the movie, you'll love this soundtrack!  I was not familiar with many of the artists, but I have really enjoyed the CD.
B001RTP3Z0|4.0|Leonard Cohen has always been a unique performer. Sort of an enigma in real life with a talent that cannot be denied. Live in London filmed on July 17, 2008 at the O2 Arena presents the man at his very best.    Performing witha spot on nine member band and looking a very dapper 75 years young, Cohen gives a very appreciative audience a performance that served as a great retrospective of his now four decades plus career. Filmed in closeups that focus on the band and not on the audience by Edward Sanders, Cohen is in top form as he performs standards like Bird on a Wire, Everybody Knows,Hallelujah, I'm Your Man, and Closing Time. There is not one slow moment in the entire two hour and thirty nine minute performance.    This is a show that was well worth waiting for and well worth purchasing. The only DVD extra is a copy of the song lyrics but really that is all that was needed.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Sappy pop with mushy strings and no soul.  These overdone arrangements may be necessary for singers with limitations in range or conveying emotion.  Diana doesn't suffer from these limitations. What happened to the renowned jazz singer?  I hope this is a once and only and that she'll get back to what she does better than anyone else.  She excels in the trio and quartet format, where she can swing and emote.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I do think that this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time.  The underlying messege of hope and redemption is brilliant.  The story of Andy Dufrasne and his time at Shawshank Prison is truely marvelous and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a superb job.
B00006J3WH|5.0|As a late (as in getting to the show late, not \\"late\\" as in I'm a member of the ranks of undead she faces) fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I've been able to watch episode after episode without the real-time wait between weeks/seasons.  As such, I still couldn't get through the shows fast enough to view the much-heralded musical episode.  But wait I did, and was blown away when finally I watched the show.  Immediately after, I rushed to the computer to purchase this CD.  What can I say specifically?  Joss is a genius, first, but also these are some talented kids.  Sarah Michelle Geller's voice is sweet and breathy, Anthony Stewart Head's is resonant and lyrical.  Amber Benson has an amazing voice--one I would have never expected from watching her portrayal of Tara.  My favorite song on the show/CD has to be \\"Under Your Spell\\", but \\"Walk Through the Fire\\" comes a close second.  If you're at all a fan of the franchise, Joss Whedon, or musicals at all, this is definitely the CD for you.
0783227434|4.0|Don't hesitate to buy this. So funny and ridiculous.  Some of the best one liners in this
B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this for the grandkids ages 5 and 8 last Christmas and they play it all the time.  I also love playing it with them.  But the 8 yr old beats me most of the time.  It's such a simple and clean concept but has a lot of strategy.  I just ordered one for my home so the kids can play it when they visit.  What a great idea!
B000YXMMAE|4.0|I'm not a huge radiohead fan so lets start off there so to clear up any chance for my lack of understanding with regard to the album. Its full of music, what i would call a branching out into more of the electronic sythesized styles of rock that are emerging today. All i need, is a great song that for me displays how focused some can become on anything in life. I hope this helps a bit, if not have a good day anyway.
0446619078|5.0|Here's another very good Harry Bosch novel from Michael Connelly, one of the best authors of detective fiction writing today.  As I point out in all my reviews of the Bosch books, Connelly is a superior craftsman who not only dreams up gripping plots, but writes beautifully.  This level of writing is often lacking in other mass market novels of this genre.<br /><br />This time Bosch is living in exile from the LAPD, having been put on forced leave after attacking his commanding officer, Harvey (\\"98\\") Pounds.  Idleness is not Bosch's strong suit, so he decides to investigate a case that has haunted him his entire life -- the murder of his mother over 30 years ago.<br /><br />As is often the case in Connelly novels, although the subject matter is...ahem...deadly serious, some scenes in the story line are very funny.  This time, for example, Bosch routinely impersonates the hated Harvey Pounds in order to gain access to LAPD services that would otherwise be off limits to him:<br /><br />  \\"He dialed the Department of Motor Vehicles law enforcement line in<br />  Sacramento and identified himself to the clerk as Lieutenant Harvey<br />  Pounds.  As he waited, he smiled because Pounds would have some<br />  explaining to do in about a month.  The department had recently begun<br />  to audit use of the DMV trace service...because cops all over the<br />  department were secretly doing traces for friendly reporters and private<br />  investigators with liberal expense accounts.  When the lieutenant's name<br />  showed up on the next DMV call list and there was no corresponding<br />  [police trace] form, Pounds would get a call from the auditors.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps I'm still in my juvenile Mad magazine phase, but little tricks like the one described above just crack me up.  They are sprinkled throughout The Last Coyote, along with enough twists and turns in the plot to keep you turning pages and, in the end, getting a jolt of surprise that you didn't see coming.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine read and one I highly recommend.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|And i mean it. This movie is so bad that it makes the first film look better than any bond film ever(not that the first one was bad though). Ice cube gets so annoying trying to have a \\"though guy\\" look. First, action heroes aren't fat or gangster, second, just don't watch this movie!
0810993139|5.0|\\"Let's face it.  Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways,   but someone needs to explain that to Greg's father.\\"     Greg Heffley is a guy who's struggling with being cool.  The three books tell Greg's daily challenges in school and with his family (younger brother Manny, older brother Rodrick).     In book 1 (Diary of a Wimpy Kid), Greg wants the Twisted Wizard game for Christmas but instead he just gets socks and pants and encyclopedias.  When he has to write his thank-you cards, he doesn't really have anything to write, so he writes cards on-line and then fills in the blanks for what he got.   Here is one of his letters:      \\"Dear Aunt Loretta, thank you so much for the awesome pants!    How did you know I wanted that for Christmas?    I love the way the pants look on my legs.    All my friends will be so jealous because I have my very own pants.\\"    I absolutely loved these books because they're so funny.  My favorite part is in Book 2, when they made Rowley eat year-old cheese on the baseball field!  Jeff Kinney really knows how to write a good story and kids will love that it's a novel in cartoons.  I recommend all three books for ages 6-16 especially for boys who think they are wimpy in school -- it give some good advice for how to deal with things that happen.    This comedy story will make anyone laugh.   A must-read!
B000U7SN8O|5.0|You have to give it 3 FULL listens before making a decision. The payoff for you may very well be worth it.
1439102813|5.0|I read this book in one day which is very unusual for me. It is a timely subject that anyone over 50 or with a loved one with dementia or Alzheimer's will find thought provoking, worrisome and clinically helpful. Genova did an outstanding job for her first novel. I have past it on and so far all agree with me. Our book club will review it next week. Great book club find.
0553381695|3.0|I was wondering how this story continued.  It continues like a history, no breaks or jumps in time.  The story is pretty good, but now I am going to have to find out who survives.  I predict that the king of the North gets bumped off (he is one main character that is not given a part of this history, you know him from others telling of him).  Anya meets Brienne and learns more about being a knight.  Some of the magic starts to develop and Jon Snow becomes someone special, even the hero.   In this story, there are three or four kings ruling the land or parts of it.  Some get killed, some get usurped and they are all fighting.  Until Daenerys gets there with her dragons, then all heck will break loose.  The odd part will be that this story should have ten or fifteen years to go, and the pace is not fast enough to get there in three or four books, unless time is skipped, and he has not done that yet.

B000001DQI|5.0|That is not an exaggeration. It's just like that.<br /><br />This album, the music, the lyrics and the era in which is was recorded are all watershed in events in music history.<br /><br />While revisiting this album, I felt compelled to write this review, since I like young people who might not be exposed to this music, to embrace an opportunity to understand a piece of rock & roll roots.<br /><br />These songs are like 3 songs in one, on almost every single track.<br />They almost seem like a 3 part play, where they rise up in the middle, with such awesome rock beats, that it's difficult not to jam with Elton. 2 of the lesser known songs (All the young girls love Alice and Social Disease) are worth an extra special listen.  The remainder are in the public consciousness by now, and should be familiar to most people.<br /><br />Enjoy it, savor it and learn from it.
1400063515|2.0|Current circumstances obviously show the relevance of Mr. Taleb's point. That makes the central message of this book interesting and Mr. Taleb deserves credit for that. I would not recommend to read this book however. This is due to the fact that after about 50 pages the central point of the book is clear, but it still goes on and on. Further, (ironically) who needs to read theoretical warnings if we can see things happening in practice; just keep an eye on the financial pages to learn about \\" the impact of the highly improbable\\".

0143038419|5.0|This was such an enjoyable read. I love the way Elizabeth describes things with such great detail. It puts you right there with her. This book made my heart smile and has inspired me to travel more. I also listened to the audio in which Elizabeth is the reader. It is so nice to hear the book with her voice. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a slice of happiness in their life.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|\\"The Changeling\\" directed by Clint Eastwood is a period piece which begins in 1928 in L.A. Reminding me of Gene Tierney, Angelina Jolie, playing Christine, dominates the screen with her smear of lurid crimson lipstick and an inscrutable smile that emerges at inappropriate times. One afternoon while she's at work in the telephone company (she worked on rollerskates) supervising the operators, her young nine-year old son disappears. Why she didn't have a babysitter for such a young kid is beyond me.<br /> Be warned; this is a very intense movie. She reports the missing boy to the L.A. police who are none too cooperative. The boy, apparently, is found in another state, but when she sees him, she realizes it's not her boy, but a kid masquerading as her son. The police force, specifically Captain Jones played by Jeffrey Donovan, insists the boy is hers, and they have solved the case. Aided by John Malkovich as a crusading clergyman, she launches a campaign against the corrupt police force.<br /> The police put her in a mental hospital without a court order, a snake pit, where she barely misses getting a shock treatment. She was lucky they didn't give her a lobotomy. (Or did they?) A child murderer and his boy assistant enter the picture. Her son may have been a victim.<br /> As I watched the last part of the movie, I counted at least five places where it could have effectively ended, but Eastwood was intent on tying up every loose end, and he was adamant in making sure that her vindication would come in all manner of ways. She sees the LAPD and its henchmen get their comeuppance, and she sees justice sort of triumph. And then what happened? Eastwood will close every last door before the credits roll.<br /> It's a beautiful period piece with authentic set features: the clothes, (her cloche hat), the old autos, the trolley cars, the streets done to perfection, all done lovingly and with great care. No expenses were spared on the setting and background, but more could have been spent on editing.<br /> Angelina does a great job, but I felt as if she were very aware that she was playing a part. Barbara Stanwyck incarnate. Believable, but too aware of her role as an actress, like the actresses of the thirties and forties, she didn't really inhabit the part, didn't or couldn't submerge herself entirely in the character. But it's hard for any actress to play the mother of all mothers.diting.   Angelina does a great job, but I felt as if she were very aware that she was playing a part. Barbara Stanwyck incarnate.

B00003CX8U|5.0|There is so much to love in this film!  I was amazed to realize that it was made so long ago--it's not in the least dated, and I can only wonder at the impact it must have made at the time.      On the surface level, it's a great show!  The dance numbers are spectacular.  The dancers are superb.  The costumes, music, staging---all of it is first class entertainment.  The erotic airline number is wonderfully sexy, as well as lyrically beautiful and even funny.  The home-time number with Gideon's girlfriend and daughter is heartwarming.  The closing \\"hello death\\" splashy number is quite amazing and makes death look, well not-so-bad.    What gives this already great show the extra power is the fact that it is such a raw autobiography of Fosse, himself.  He looks at his life with amazing honesty and judges himself as, in the words of the Ben Vereen song, \\"a man who allowed himself to be adored but not loved.\\"  Wow..not too many folks have that kind of self awareness, and then to mount it on stage in such a flashy way, is an act of incredible daring.  I heard the great Anna Russell in an opera spoof say that \\"anything is ok if you sing it.\\"  It seem like this work of art, which it is, may be Fosse's way of making his life, the good, bad and ugly of, into something beautiful.  That works for me, anyway.    The cast is first rate.  Roy Sheider is wonderfully charismatic and charming and makes us love Joe Gideon, the Fosse alter-ego.  The dancers who played the three women in his life:  his ex-wife, daughter and girlfriend are equally wonderful.     I highly recommend this film.  I find a lot of recent Broadway musicals really annoying but this one is a beauty.
B00005NP04|5.0|There is no one in country music who has a voice like Martina McBride-can hold notes for unbelievable amounts of time, has a crystal pureness, the most powerful voice, yet can emit every emotion known. Worth the buy!!!! Also Shine, her newest album is a must buy!!!! Just listen to \\"Lies\\" and you will see why!
B00000JNOJ|5.0|If you're just coming across Muddy for the first time, or you're venturing into his back catalog, this is clearly one of Muddy's all time great recordings.  Along with the Newport Festival live set, and Muddy Sings Big Bill, you can't find any finer blues from this era.  Ain't nobody who can come near these deeply felt waters.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Stevie Wonder in concert in December 2007 in Phoenix and was just thrilled! I was always a huge fan, but on stage, he was not only as talented as I knew he would be, he was also personable, gracious, friendly, funny, and interactive. I remain in awe of his talents and knew I had to have this DVD to keep forever to remember his concert. The crowd was diverse and reacted warmly to him. He is wonderful; I can't say enough about Stevie Wonder. Anyone who is remotely a fan should enjoy watching this DVD.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|I have every Diana Krall CD, even some imports. Have seen her in concert 3 times. Saw her once from the front row of a small venue, just after she got famous. I could even see that she had on baby blue toenail polish to match her outfit! I'm a gushing fan. Couldn't wait to receive this CD.   But, what happened? Her voice is unrecognizable on the first cut. I thought it was Natalie Cole. The piano is so stripped down and simple that it's lifeless.  Having just become a Eliane Elias fan and buying all her back CDs, I feel there is just NO COMPARISON. Eliane's piano is multilayered, rich, complicated and so filled with her passion that I have been brought to tears. Both are highly trained pianists but, Elias has been at it twice as long and it shows. BRAVO ELIANE ELIAS!!  I can no longer afford to see Krall in concert, but was lucky to see Elias in a small venue in February and I recommend that you do too. Let's make her the superstar that Krall has become.   I completely agree with the review about the breathy voice.  The photos on this CD are nice but please, check out \\"Bossa Nova Stories\\" and \\"Dreamer\\" by Eliane Elias to hear (as they say on American Idol) ARTISTRY!!
0575081406|4.0|Because Mr. Rothfuss is a writer of talent, intelligence, and style, and because this is his first novel I'm going to cut the man some slack. But the author has given us a 722 page introduction to his tale! That's a tall order, particularly for those of us without a lot of time to read!    In this first novel of a serial, there are needless details and digressions, as if every little moment in the story needed to be spelled out to the reader, as if every happenstance of Kvothe's life were vital to record. But do we really need to hear about Kvothe's every teenage urge and setback?  (His time at the university seems particularly juvenile--loud echoes of Harry Potter). Do we need to visit the cobbler's shop or listen to pontification about the biology of dragon fire? Clearly Mr. Rothfuss has been overly seduced by his own creation. He needs to relax his hand a little and give the reader more control. The end result is a 700 page book that feels like a warm-up for greater tales to come. It's not a slow read by any means, but it is a lot to ask of readers--for a story which is only in the early stage of building. The fact that this 700 page book is merely an introduction tends to keep it more in the domain of fantasy, with less hope of reaching other audiences.     It's a shame that Rothfuss might be wedded to tome-like format that often captures the fantasy market.  That might mean that some of us are less inclined to read this skillful storyteller.  Will I return to Mr. Rothfuss for the next installment? I might. I enjoyed the read. But I'm hoping that he and Kvothe will both grow up a bit. I hope that Mr. Rothfuss will not indulge in Kvothe's every moment, or in his own skill as a writer. I hope that he will next give us a tale with speed and dexterity, and a hero who's greatest deeds destine the lesser ones for the chopping room floor.
B000SEHG5U|1.0|Don't think about it. Exit out of the order screen for this and don't return.    &#34;The God Delusion&#34; is a hateful load of garbage written by a small-minded intellectual who puts up faulty arguments to exerpts from famous arguments for the existence of God. If you DO read this book, you will notice both the rather senseless fervor and hatred Mr. Dawkins puts into his writing and the painstakingly omitted arguments that little Richie could not properly combat. i ask that you do not read this rather pitiful rag, or you shall regret it...
B00005JLD4|5.0|Another story about invading white folks destroying indigenous people.  SIGH.  Branngh does evil very well as the embodiment of the invader.  The very best part of this movie is the young Australian girls who play the leads.  The girls are taken from their mothers so they can be saved from themselves and their culture.  They spend very little time with the nuns before they escape by following the fence (of the title) that in effect divides white from aboriginal.  I love the irony of the girls using what was meant to keep them out.  Their track through the desert is a spiritual journey complete with animal spirits, angels in the guise of benevolent strangers, fences that disappear and reappear when you believe, etc.  This movie is well worth watching but it left me with a sense of frustration wondering how many times are we going to live out this same drama in yet another setting.
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|Great price from amazon.com on this film.  The film is fun, but Pierce Brosnan cannot sing to save his life.  Luckily Merrell Streep is wonderful in this film.  If you want a \\"pick me up,\\" then this is your film.  Breathtaking ocean views in the filming sequence.  We bought it since we will watch it again and again. If you are an ABBA fan, you'll LOVE this film.
B001F7EZ9Y|5.0|It's 2010 now.  Two years since the album \\"Black Ice\\" over shadowed the world, selling over two million here (the U.S.) and 6.2 million worldwide.  To this day, I still remember attending my first ac/dc concert.  It was the first and loudest concert I have ever attended.  It was a great concert, with five songs from the new album.      The album \\"Black Ice\\" can be enjoyed over time, signifying that this album will be considered a great album later in history.  Many may say that ac/dc recycles their guitar riffs, but if you shine on a light on that... the statement is false.  Here, I'll give you a question.  Does Flick of the Swich sound anything like Black Ice?      The album is very, very consistant.  I repeated \\"very\\" because it's ac/dc's most consistant album probably since 1990.  It might mark their last album, but it's something you can really look back at and say \\"Wow, this is really great album.\\"      Thanks to Angus Young & Co millions have had a chance to watch a good concert as well as hold an album in their hands.  No digital copies from Itunes, but the really thing!
045122499X|5.0|This book is such a fantastic historically correct novel.  It is real page turner. I read the book twice in less than 8 months, just to make certain that I did not miss anything, and the second time was just as good as the first one.   A must read!!!!
B001ED7C58|1.0|I'm sorry, I'm not a music know-it-all or anything, but this soundtrack blows.  For such an, apparently, amazing movie you'd think the music would be awesome.  Yet, the music sucks.  Robert's song sounds more like my college guy friends drunk on rum.  Yikes!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This is a wonderful movie about early Christianity.  A very good family movie choice during Lent and Easter time.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This is an awesome product. My baby loved it from the start. We bought it when he was 2 months & it was very difficult to get him to sleep. He took to it right away. He's 4 months now and loves it more than ever. The music is soft and has the perfect volume for him to fall asleep to. The light is just bright enough to light the mobile up so he can see it spin in the dark. It was definitely worth the money. If something happened to this one, I would buy the same one again.

B0006GVJEE|4.0|Growing up in New York City is never simple, even for the most privileged of adolescents. And the age of twelve is arguably the most impressionable period for a youngster. So when a young girl witnesses something exceptionally brutal, adolescence may evaporate just as the early morning dew. This is a slice of the dilemma that `Mathilda' (Natalie Portman) inherits in this film. \\"Leon,\\" the title character played by Jean Reno, inherits Mathilda and the dilemma. Portman delivers a performance of circumstance well beyond her years with style, savvy, and intelligence.  The powers that be could have easily entitled this one \\"Mathilda,\\" because she creates the dynamics of the story, and adds a pleasant wrinkle to the neo-noir genre. However, it must be duly noted that Jean Reno renders a creative and daring portrayal of a heartless assassin who slips to care.
0545128285|5.0|The book belonged to Harry Potter when he was in school.  The author is so talented,  I cannot put down her books until they are read.  I received this book ahead of the projected date in perfect condition.  Since I got it for such a bargain, I went on line to the UK to donate to JK Rowling's childrens fund (see book).
1416562605|3.0|Nothing new or earth shattering in this book about life in India, just the style in which it is written - open letters to the premier of China.  The book was decent, if someone is considering to read it I would say go ahead, but I would not push this book on someone who isn't looking for it.
0525951113|2.0|I just finished reading the final few pages of this book and am extremely disappointed with it.    I'll start out with the positive.  The book is indeed a \\"page-turner\\" and Suarez is able to create interesting characters and throw numerous plot twists in to keep the reader guessing.    That said, I think I'm most upset that this book was billed as a technological thriller.  Quotes from the dust cover: \\"...tech fiction...\\", \\"...tech is invoked with inside knowledge...\\", \\"...an eye for technical detail that goes unmatched...\\", \\"...how other novels that rely on technology will be judged...\\".  In reality, it's actually a book of ludicrous science fiction that tries to pass itself off as what could actually happen.  Maybe this doesn't bother other readers but as someone who does understand network security (I work in IT) it's incredibly frustrating.    Suarez begins various scenes by using real computer security techniques (something I appreciated at first) and then throws in something else completely impossible.  The first time this happened I wrote it off as a necessary plot device but as the book progressed it just becomes ridiculous.  I probably wouldn't have minded so much if I understood from the beginning that the book was complete fantasy.  As it were, I was expecting a realistic look at technology and was miffed when the book ended with lighting-from-the-fingertips weaponry ala the Emperor from Star Wars.    The other reason this book got under my skin was the cheap plot devices Suarez used to try to make the book seem \\"dark\\" including (semi-spoilers) killing off nearly all of the main characters and bringing others back from the dead.  Maybe my expectations are too high but when the book is compared to \\"early Tom Clancy\\" there is a certain bar that needs to be met in order to avoid disappointment.    The book starts out strong only to buckle under its own weight when the author needs to rely on increasingly bizarre technological advances to keep the momentum going.  I had high hopes after the first few pages - as I mentioned, the story does progress quickly and the writing is engaging - but was left disgusted by the time I finished the final page.
B001E5FYS8|3.0|This documentary recounts how French high wire walker Philippe Petit and a small band of accomplices managed to string a cable across the roofs of the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974 so he could walk, dance, kneel, run and lie down in mid-air for an unforgettable 45 minutes.<br />The movie never mentions the 2001 attack that destroyed the towers but that is always in your mind and gives the movie some additional poignancy.<br />We meet Petit, who is articulate and almost laughably French. He had already walked on a wire between the two spires of Notre Dame in Paris and on a bridge in Sydney. He was apparently obsessed by the idea of walking between the twin towers from the moment construction on them began.<br />Why is the event interesting enough to deserve to be remembered? Like all theater, it was fleeting and transitory, yet it created an image of beauty that those who witnessed it never forgot.<br />From the grim aftermath, we know that the towers themselves were transitory. Like twin Towers of Babel, they aspired to touch the sky and yet they were so easily destroyed by those evil men.<br />And I guess it teaches us that everything we create and build and achieve, no matter how grandiose and significant it may seem, is transitory in this world of ours.<br />According to the movie, the event changed Petit in some fundamental way. For a short time, he became a star. He broke up with his girlfriend and his relationships with his loyal helpers also ruptured. I wish the movie had delved more into the aftermath. One extra included on the Dvd is an animated version of the story intended for children. It's almost more moving and resonant that the movie itself.<br />In the end we're left with the unforgettable image of a man walking, so it appears, on thin air, suspended in space a quarter of a mile in the sky.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Let It Bleed is indeed an excellent album by The Rolling Stones. This is one of their better ones despite the troubles they encountered during the recording sessions. Their music reflects good judgment and it has a distinctive sound to it that all emerging rock musicians should study. The quality of the sound on this album is nothing short of excellent; and that artwork is very well done. Awesome!<br /><br />The album starts off with one of their biggest hits, \\"Gimme Shelter.\\" \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is electrifying; they never let go of a bad note. Mick Jagger and Mary Clayton belt this out with heart, soul and all their might. I love it--talk about apocalyptic! The guitar work is faultless and the band's music goes perfectly with the vocals to this tune. The melody itself is instantly memorable. \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is more than worth the price of admission alone! In addition, \\"Love In Vain\\" has Mick performing this cover of a Robert Johnson tune with the band plays the music as only The Stones could play! \\"Love In Vain\\" is particularly memorable for its bluesy feel; the vocals, the changes between major and minor keys and that guitar work all do an excellent job of conveying all the nuances of the lyrics to this ballad.<br /><br />\\"Country Honk\\" is one of the last real country songs The Stones ever did; they turned out this well done tune with terrific guitar and string work as Mick sings it to perfection. Mick sings of a man who wants a woman who has left him as he laments that fact that \\"it's the honky tonk women... (who give him) the honky tonk blues.\\" \\"Country Honk\\" is also a countrified version of their previous tune called \\"Honky Tonk Woman.\\" \\"Live With Me\\" has a fine rock and roll flavor to it and that piano is totally amazing! \\"Live With Me\\" is very strong; and I also like the title track, \\"Let It Bleed.\\" \\"Let It Bleed\\" has a country/bluesy flavor to it that no other rock band could ever truly replicate; The Rolling Stones were and remain all THAT good. \\"Let It Bleed\\" is easily a major highlight of this album. A friend of mine pointed out to me that \\"Let It Bleed\\" was a thinly veiled reference to The Beatles' album Let It Be; the two bands often competed with each other for attention and sales. Such is life!<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rambler\\" has an excellent arrangement; and \\"You Got The Silver\\" has some incredible lead vocals by Keith Richards--wow, how they do this number well! That guitar work shines. \\"Monkey Man\\" rocks really hard and it has a great sound to it that I really like to hear. At the very ends, the album closes with the powerful, impressive and even somewhat larger-than-life ballad, \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\" \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" was The Stones answer to The Beatles tune called \\"Hey Jude;\\" they perform this with The London Bach Choir. In addition, for \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" Jimmy Miller plays drums and Al Kooper plays that incredible French Horn!<br /><br />Overall, Let It Bleed deserves to be an Amazon \\"essential recording.\\" The Stones never falter here and I love each and every song on the album.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|A classic fairy tale from Disney with a wish on a star, that takes you really far. Jimney Cricket gets his debut as a conscience for a wooden puppet. He has no idea what he is in for when he applies for the job. Full of fun songs and good morals to follow. My favorite is \\"a lie will grow and grow, until it is as plain as the nose on your face\\".
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|Although I though this film should have definitely won the Oscar for best film of 2008, it still does not top Fincher's all time masterpiece, Fight Club.  Whereas Benjamin Button is a seamless work of narrative, historical context, make-up magic, and visual effects on par with any summer blockbuster, Fight Club had one of the most poignant antiestablishment messages of the 20th Century, and will take its place alongside the masterpieces of that time period.  Now, this film is an absolute delight to watch, even as it breaks your heart.  No real scientific explanation is given for Benjamin's condition, although the philosophical side of the story tends to lean toward predetermination and poetic justice.  The real meat of the story is seeing the two love interests' lives intersect, while both realize they are doomed from the start.  The aging make-up and CG effects are astounding, it's really tough to tell sometimes where Brad Pitt ends and the computer imagery begins.  As everyone knows by now, the 2nd half of the film is a heart breaker, watching Benjamin devolve into a senile child, until the tear jerking ending, made all the more resonant by the approach of Hurricane Katrina, which I felt really symbolized the death of the New Orleans these characters knew throughout their entire lives.  The final shot was both chilling and comforting, bringing closure to an epic story that will go down as one of the saddest romances in film history.
0689835604|4.0|My 7 month old loves this book! When I show it to him he smiles and  squeals with delight. As most of of know, 7 month olds not only delight in the words and the pictures, but they like to feel and taste the story as well! This book is not holding up. The \\"lift flaps\\" are very thin and seem like they are going to tear off of when my baby lifts them. I guess I'm just used to his other favorite book, \\"What Does Baby Do\\" another lift the flap book by Begin Smart. That (like all of their books) is VERY durable! I suppose we'll just have to be very gentle with \\"Where Is Baby's Belly Button?\\" It is a great book, however I wish it was more durable so it could last for our next child!
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|Madeline Peyroux has been charming all along.  If you are a lover of Billie Holiday's singing, you can't help but enjoy the similarities.  What makes Bare Bones special, which it is, are the songs, all of which were written for this project.  Lots of people had a hand in it, but there is a consistent richness and depth to the words, with lovely well-played music in a spare setting.  Many songs linger with me, such as River of Tears and Our Lady of Pigalle.  I expect to listen to this for a long time.      Peyroux is applying her vocal skill to material that is personal, perhaps confessional in nature.  Whether or not autobiographical, there is a sharing of intimacy and evocation that makes it a compelling work.
0226443221|5.0|I first heard about this book on NPR, and the topic really disturbed me.  When I got around to reading it, I found out there was much more to this tragedy than the ghastly headlines, it really takes you in so many directions.  I did hear of this terrible event in Chicago when it occurred, but did not realize how high the death toll was, or the causes of the disaster.  After reading this book, it really shows you how much you miss when you rely on mainstream media sources without exploring other avenues of information.  This book not only shows us how something so horrible could happen in an advanced country such as ours, but also shows us how to prevent this from ever happening again.  I really hope that government officials from all levels read this book.  Highly recommended.

B001K3JF7K|3.0|If I had not heard these songs in a pop orchestral style before, it sure feels like I have.  And these are done very nicely but the project doesn't seem to have a point to it.  DK sings the material well enough but does not add much to prior interpretations.  The arrangements are not my cuppa, but in a couple of instances there were some surprises.  A great \\"love-making\\" album and possibly a must for devotees.  But I doubt I will listen to it very much.

B001GCUO1G|4.0|As you may or may not know, the workprint of X-Men Origins: Wolverine has<br />just recently leaked out onto the web. I am one of the many people who<br />have seen it, and me being an X-Men fan (OK, well I wasn't too big a<br />fan of X-Men 3: The Last Stand), I decided to check it out. Movies that<br />explore the origins of a specific character are usually a dime a dozen,<br />which is why I wasn't looking too forward to X-Men Origins: Wolverine<br />upon seeing the trailer, but I decided to give it a go anyways.<br /><br />The result is that I was surprisingly satisfied! It's not really a<br />typical X-Men movie. Then again, you have to know what you are seeing<br />before walking into the theater: an X-Men movie. And Hugh Jackman is<br />excellent as usual in his performance as Wolverine, the mutant with<br />those metal claws that come out of his knuckles we all have come to<br />know and love.<br /><br />This movie is the start of a series of movies that explore the origins<br />of characters. The storyline isn't really as confusing or \\"Stupid\\" as<br />some people have made it out to be, actually. It's not the best story<br />but it serves well. Whereas X2's storyline was easy to follow, this<br />story IS a tad confusing in some bits. As for the humor- this movie<br />isn't as humorless as people are complaining about, there is lots of<br />dry humor, And we even get a pretty funny introduction to the character<br />of Gambit, as well as the boxing match scene is pretty funny too. Ryan<br />Reynolds' performance as the talkative Deadpool is pretty funny as<br />well.<br /><br />The action scenes are the real highlight, though. The multiple battles<br />between Wolverine and Sabretooth are very well done, and the<br />introduction to the newly-embalmed Deadpool is quite stylish too.<br />There's an entertaining chase scene, which ends with a nice finish.<br /><br />I can't really judge the Special effects yet since the finished cut is<br />not released but I can tell they are going to be great. What WAS<br />finished was pretty impressive, in fact the opening credits played over<br />the war scenes were full of some great effects. There's some good plot<br />twists too- one towards the end that was very strong and unexpected.<br /><br />Sure there are some let-downs- some of the introductions (most notably<br />Cyclops) were a tad rushed, the ending was a bit too quick, the<br />character of Gambit, while funny, was a bit confusing, the story was a<br />tad hard to follow in a few places. But looking past the discrepancies,<br />this is a pretty good film, and they may be fixed with the 15 minutes<br />they are going to add to the finished cut. While this isn't the best<br />X-Men movie, I'd say this is worthy, and the start of something great.scenes were full of some great effects.

B001TODCII|5.0|Once in awhile the movie industry puts out a film truly worth seeing and this movie is one of them.  Liam does a outstanding job of pulling off the ex-cia father who hunts down the kidnappers of his daughter.  It was so great that we went to see it a second time and enjoyed it even more.  All young girls and parents of young girls should see this film.

B001FSDOZO|1.0|Nickelback is one example of why mainstream music totally fails. For example you have generic vocals, simple guitar work, and songs that all sound the same. Just listen to this: [...] and you'll find out that the two songs presented in that video are essentially the same song.<br /><br />As well as their crappy generic lyrics. But first off their song titles. \\"Something in your Mouth\\"??? Nice Chad, that was soooooo subtle. Hell, I hate Britney Spears but even she's more subtle with sexual innuendo (If You Seek Amy- say that slowly and you'll get what she's REALLY trying to say). And \\"S.E.X\\"? Self explanitory. But back to the topic of lyrics, whover writes these lyrics need to get a sense of creativity:<br /><br />\\"Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong<br />Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long<br />Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody<br />Aint it funny how the honey wanted you all along!\\"<br /><br />Interesting, you are singing about a whore who doesn't care about money. And \\"Aint it funny how the honey wanted you all along\\"? That makes A LOT of sense. (sarcasm)<br /><br />If you want good music, do NOT listen to Nickeltrash. How \\"tough\\" and \\"HxC!!!!\\" guys listen to this beats me...
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|What Cohen has done here, is what so many artists aspire to but few<br />achieve, not only does he present an outstanding body of work culled<br />over a lifetime, indeed he transcends it and creates a piece of work<br />that stands alone on its own artistic merit.  This is a masterpiece.  It should be on everyone's best of list for 2009
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Diana's smooth, elegant vocals more than sustain this quiet collection of favorites and standards. This is a lush, richly-produced body of music that certainly merits a place in your collection; it's very well done.<br /><br />Having said that, this entire CD is about 3 clicks past mellow. It is definitely a tribute to \\"quiet\\" nights. As an avid listener and Diana Krall fan, I kept waiting for something up-tempo, something with more keyboard presence, something lively and fresh and infused with energy.<br /><br />This is a slow-dance collection, a 5-star CD, wonderfully done, and I'm glad to own it. But I won't be listening in the car ---- not if I prefer to stay awake. This isn't driving music.<br /><br />Be advised: The title \\"Quiet Nights\\" is entirely correct. Listen at home, by the fireplace, perhaps with someone you love. It's beautiful music, done in a well-beyond-mellow way.

0451450523|3.0|The last unicorn, a beautiful and powerful immortal creature far removed from humanity, journeys to discover where her people have disappeared. She meets up with an incompetent magician, Schmendrick, and a hard old woman, Molly, who go with her to King Haggard's castle where the Red Bull has captured the unicorns. A beautifully written and imaginative fairy tale (the details of the unicorn's character and style is utterly enchanting) that is more style than substance. Perhaps seeing the movie first ruined it for me. Grade: B
B00007GZR5|3.0|Not what I expected.  Lots of sensationalism.  Not the spiritual movie I had been led to believe it was.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I really did not like the Grinch movie made by this studio and starring Jim Carrey so I did not expect great things from this one.<br /><br />I was wrong to judge it so hastily because Horton Hears a Who really is a delightful show with a great message. Jim Carrey did a great job and the movie was fun and enjoyable for everyone in my family.
0385338732|4.0|I have been a fan of Sophie Kinsella for years, ever since her Shopaholic books found their way into my life. They were my first experience with Chick Lit, and continue to be the books I use when trying to explain the genre to someone who has no clue.<br /><br />That being said, Remember Me? was another Kinsella hit. I was a bit skeptical of the plot - a woman who has lost her memory, forced to figure out what has gone on in the past three years and survive the life she created. It sounded as though I would be able to guess the plot changes, but I was pleasantly surprised. Kinsella did a good job of adding in slight twists that urged me to continue reading (rather than assume the same old same old would be happening). I love her writing style, and the ending left me satisfied without being totally predictable. The character development was pretty good, though I did question how quickly some of the previous \\"friends\\" changed their attitudes - I haven't been in that particular situation, though, so I can't judge it too much.
B0010ZR160|5.0|The Bottom Line:    An interesting-enough crime story in its own right, Gone Baby Gone is elevated to another level by terrific acting and an ending that asks perhaps better than any movie what \\"doing the right thing\\" actually means; with several standout scenes and the courage of its convictions, it is most definitely a film to watch or own.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Even this film, like the amazingly uplifting story   contained within it, is a cinderella story that translates   across continents and socio-economic status!  In a world which is so cynical and jaded and has   seemingly lost it's capacity to be impressed by or moved   by anything that doesn't have a huge price tag or glamour   attached to it, here's a story that stimulates the human   spirit in a way that is very refreshing!  During the 2008/2009 awards season, I was like many people   who wondered just who and what in the hell was   a SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE!! As it systematically cleaned   house at all the major awards: The SAG, Golden Globes   and The Oscars against some very stiff competition,   this underdog of a film began to recieve much buzz and   a tidalwave of curiosity from people who wanted to see   what all the hoopla was about!  I can't really say much more than what has already been   said about this movie by a score of other reviewers.   The whole cast (Especially Dev Patel & Freida Pinto)  pulled it off with the stellar vision   and direction of Danny Boyle.  The young actors who played Jamal, Salim & Latika as  children deserve major kudos too!--Great Job!   As I said, with movies like Milk, Benjamin Button,   The Changeling, The Reader, The Wrestler, Doubt   and others, all of which were amazing projects themselves,  it was truly a long-shot for this foreign-based feel good   low budget but very well made film to even get a nod,   let alone win Best Picture Oscar and damn near   everything else but the kitchen sink!  Slumdog Millionaire is a great film and proof that in   this world that's much too concerned with being cool,   ultra sarcastic, and afraid of coming off as corny,   that a film about the underdogs and good guys   finishing on top has won out!---Check It Out!

I know we will be making projects for months (and years!) to come because of the inspiration in this book.<br /><br />The Martha Stewart craft crew have outdone themselves on this book and I love that they have launched a new crafts blog as well.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian is the greatest. I like her style. There are other videos I like and have found useful. Confidence by the instructor was never anything I looked for.

Due to emergencies I have not been faithful to the commitment she asks for.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Far superior to The Condemned, the American quasi-remake/rip-off, Battle Royale takes the inherently-compelling premise of a group of people stuck in a isolated place forced to fight to the death and milks it for all its worth; if you're the type of person who finds that plot description appealing (you know who you are!) then rent or buy this very interesting film.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|honestly watching this movie I felt like I was watching a feature length trailer for the actual movie.     I got bored, so I turned it off, if you want a copy I'd happily sell you mine!    The storyline is fragmented, neither Natalie nor Scarlett really excel in their characterisations; the supporting cast all appear (thankfully for their careers) anonymous.    your money would be better spent on the DVD's of the SHO mini-series ...  which we also had and enjoyed!
B000UJ48O0|5.0|While I'd be nuts to let my little cousins watch this, I find it a very entertaining show to watch. The plots are a little much at times, but what soap opera isn't? If you like Gossip Girl, you're sure to love The O.C. 2 thumbs up from this 20 year old!
B000KQGP2G|2.0|I've reviewed three other Pain of Salvation albums here. All rather highly rated. All turned out to be obnoxiously long reviews because I couldn't stop myself from writing until I had every little detail that made those albums so great down on paper. One has been dubbed my favorite album of all time. I generally hold Pain of Salvation in the absolute highest tier of not just great progressive metal, but godly music in general. I view Daniel Gildenlow as one of the most talented and powerful individuals in the business. I even managed to enjoy the musical ambiguity and lyrical labyrinth that was BE. In short, I pretty much unconditionally love this band like a typical naive fanboy.    That being said, Pain of Salvation have managed to release an album that I completely despise with every fiber of my being. I didn't just get this album yesterday, either. I've had it for around two years, which is generally more than enough time for me to \\"understand\\" an album that I dislike at first - assuming there's anything in it worth understanding to begin with. No such luck here.    This band has always been very good at a few critical things - taking an idea or a concept, building a tangible framework around that concept, crafting a world to house that framework, and then developing an intricate and empathic musical journey through that world wherein both the lyrics *and* the music express the nuances of the original concept. One is incomplete without the other. As such, their music has never really been a vessel for the instrumental masturbation that you typically find in progressive metal. Rather, they utilize their instruments as a medium for the listener to lose themselves in the world that has been presented. This approach has produced a number of stellar albums, and some albums that were pretty strange but, at the end of the day, still captivating. One in particular seems overly relevant -     Since Scarsick is the direct followup to The Perfect Element I, I feel that I should mention a few things about that album. The Perfect Element I is basically about a boy (He) and a girl (She) living in a fictional place known as Idioglossia. As the characters grow up together, they each have vital things missing in their lives which leave empty spaces in their wake, and the characters consequently choose to fill these empty spaces in rather depraved and jarring ways while trying to survive in the dreary backside of society. The album encompasses a large number of complex and interrelated themes, including childhood, adolescence, violence, sexuality, tragedy, loss, the human mind and soul, the individual and the society in which he exists, emotional extremes, and more. The album eventually comes to a conclusion with a focus on the male counterpart, He, as his society shuns him, burns the spark of life out of him, and drains all will out of his soul. The lyricism on The Perfect Element I is incredibly dark and distraught, but also very poetic and intelligent. The way the lyrics are delivered gives the listener insight into what the characters are feeling and the trials which they are being pushed through. The music behind the words admirably enhances the vocal delivery. Overall, the album is incredibly moving and largely convincing.    Fast forward to Scarsick. The album is a continuation of the story introduced on The Perfect Element I, but the focus has shifted entirely to He after his destructive falling out with society. Now, remember what I said about Pain of Salvation being really good at taking a concept and developing an encompassing lyrical and musical framework around it? Apparently, the male protagonist from TPE is now very bitter and completely pissed off at everything, and Pain of Salvation *really* want you to know that. No longer do we have the wide range of themes that were found on TPE. Here, there's pretty much one theme - \\"I'M ANGRY AND CYNICAL AND I HATE EVERYTHING.\\" Now, from a conceptual perspective I can completely understand the basic approach that the band has taken. We have this utterly wrecked character who has been gradually transformed into a sardonic prick, and as usual the lyrics and the music are going to as closely as possible reflect the things that this character is feeling. The only problem this time around is that the things that this character is feeling apparently translate into really horrible music and embarrassingly pathetic lyrics. A great concept is a great concept and a great story is a great story, but if your delivery is unlistenable, then you have an issue.    The other problem is that while the themes and ideas on TPE were genuinely interesting and abstract, the stuff on Scarsick comes way too close to being a vessel for Daniel's personal views on Western civilization. It's not exactly a big secret that Daniel doesn't like the United States government very much. At one point he even refused to go on a tour in the US because he didn't want to submit to the US government's finger printing requirements for foreign visitors. So here we have the song \\"America\\". Not only is the music itself beyond irritating with its bouncy rhythms and poppy melodies (for an example of how to do this in a slightly less retarded fashion, look back to the Entropia album and the song \\"Stress\\"), but the lyrics are typical anti-war, anti-government, anti-capitalism stuff - and they're more banal than interesting.    To further exacerbate the lyrical tragedy, you have songs like \\"Cribcaged\\" where Daniel includes the f-bomb in something like 16 or 17 consecutive vocal lines, denouncing everything from home designers and strip poles to million dollar kitchens and Al Pacino posters. F this. F that. And that. Oh, and that too. And those dozen things over there also. Come on. Seriously? I mean, to be honest, I can probably agree with some of the ideas that he's trying to get across there - although some of the subjects he targets are laughable - but the way he does it is completely juvenile. I'd understand if the song was a joke, but I'm pretty sure he's being completely serious. Sad. Furthermore, with songs like this and \\"America\\", it can be difficult to tell if the thoughts are those of the male character from TPE or those of Daniel himself. This, at least for me, interferes with the mood and immersion that made TPE such an incredible album and is one of the major reasons why this album is a disappointment to me as The Perfect Element part 2.    There are some other gems. On \\"Spitfall\\", Daniel seemingly found it necessary to formulate an ironically rapped song that cuts down the mainstream rap artists that are dominating the American airwaves. I found the lyrics fairly amusing, but not so much in a \\"Hey, this is really good\\" way. More in a \\"Wow, is Daniel really singing this?\\" sort of way. Musically, this song - as well as the preceding title track - is somewhat reminiscent of Candiria, with the exception that Candiria is actually good at making this sort of music, while Pain of Salvation completely suck at it.    \\"Disco Queen\\" is just bad. I'm sorry, but mixing straight disco and metal isn't new or exciting. Other bands have done this kind of thing, and it's dumb. That is probably the reason why this appears to be new and exciting - nobody does it anymore because of how utterly dumb it is. The closing track, \\"Enter Rain\\", is pathetic as a closing track. Ten minutes of boredom. Coming from a closing a track as awesome as \\"The Perfect Element\\", \\"Enter Rain\\" doesn't even qualify as a proper climax. Some of the other tracks are okay. \\"Mrs. Modern Mother Mary\\" has some cool rhythms and is a decent song all around. \\"Kingdom of Loss\\" is pretty good musically, but has more of that trite lyricism about how everything in America is for sale. Meh.    All in all, I just can't find much to like on this album. It's missing the flow, the conviction, the power, and the pure pathos of everything that this band has put out prior. Much like the fictional character that Scarsick is meant to represent, you could say that this album is a burning wreck. I guess, in some way, I can give credit to the band for making that thematic connection (if that was even their intent), but it came at a severe cost. I doubt I would ever recommend this album to anybody who has not heard Pain of Salvation before, because the very things that have defined Pain of Salvation as a standout band over the last decade are grossly understated here. Or altogether missing.    Hopefully this was a one-off.
B0002W4SWC|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Distinctly overrated, Bridget Jones's Diary is nowhere near as fun, charming, or witty as I had been led to believe; little more than yet another formulaic romance, this is not a movie to seek out.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|Heath Ledger as the Joker ...<br /><br />What we failed to realize that the joke was on us ... this is a script that should have ended up in the trash and not on the screen ...<br /><br />And as for Heath, well it may seem unkind but the only way you could win an award for this performance, in this role, in this movie would be posthumously!<br /><br />I was so bored by this we just turned it off less than half way thru ...
B001I0Z43Y|5.0|I love this thing. By that I mean it is cheap storage for 32GB of storage in a tiny package. It appears to be well made. Just don't forget to re-format you memory sticks with your device prior to first use. Then don't forget to leave the memory inside the unit because once it is formatted this way you can't separate the memory and use it standalone (without re-formatting it). It seems this adapter turns the attached SD or SDHC cards into a RAID JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks). You get all the storage as though it were one single disk. SWEET and CHEAP.

B000VNMMR0|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The Die Hard movies are all about John McClane the everyman, so it's a bit surprising that this fourth installment decided to turn him into a superhero; when you couple that disjarring fact with the boring villain of Timothy Olyphant and general PG-13 lameness, this starts feeling less like a Die Hard movie and more like a mid-80s Schwarzenegger vehicle.
0439023483|5.0|Iève read many, many books, but this is my favourite. It isnt  so much quick, love at first sight kind of thing, but a slow, gradual thing. I like how the main charactor is strong and a bold person. Recomended to anyone 11 and up.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|It's hard to talk about the Daniel Craig Bond, and particularly this movie, without using the word \\"gritty.\\"  So, there you go.  Last summer, I read all the Bond novels in order.  Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond is more like the Ian Fleming vision than any of the previous actors', including, even, Sean Connery.  This is easily the most sober of the Bond films.  Lots of exciting action, only over-the-top in the same way as are the action scenes, in say, the Bourne movies.  (And the fight scenes seem clearly to owe much to the Bourne films.)<br /><br />That said, to be successful, Craig is going to have to tweak it a bit.  We can enjoy a more serious and realistic Bond, as an offset to the serial nonsense which are the Roger Moore films.  But he can't be a total downer indefinitely.  We're going to want to like the guy at some point and we're going to need at least a little of that Bond humor.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Okay, I've read the negative reviews of this excellent CD.  I truly believe they are missing the point.  It's called \\"Quiet Nights\\" people!  Some reviewers say it makes them fall asleep or \\"I listened to it while driving to work & it is a snoozer\\".  Well, if you are looking for a morning drive CD, then this isn't it.  It doesn't swing & bop like some of the past Diana CD's because it wasn't meant to.  Light a candle, grab your sweetheart & bask in the glow.  It makes me love & appreciate my wife even more when I listen to this & think of her.  This is a cd for lounging, relaxing & loving.  Why would she \\"belt\\" out the vocals on romantic bossa nova classics?  It should be a sultry whisper which it is & her voice conveys a sensual loving spirit like no other vocalist I've ever heard.  Elvis Costello must be the luckiest guy on the planet!  I'm sure Diana will make other CD's in the future that will really swing, but this one is a different flavor.  Claus Ogerman's arrangements are very gentle & lush.  The man is a legend...one of the finest arrangers that the world has ever known.  I feel honored to have another of his works to enjoy.  The singing is full of vulnerability & warmth.  This cd is meant to chill folks!  The songs, singing & arrangements are beyond beautiful, romantic & tender.  If you aren't interested in an entire cd of laid back ballads, then this may not be your cup of tea.  But for me, it'll be in constant rotation in my cd player.  Close your eyes & let the warmth flow over you as it was meant to.  If you listen with the right frame of mind, it can move you to tears.  It puts a smile on my face every time I listen to it.  Wonderful!
B000W91RUG|5.0|i don't really know if they could for certain, but The Big Bang Theory comes damn near close as far as i'm concerned.<br /><br />I, too, was a bit apprehensive about the new series taking the place of another great show(The Class, with Jason Ritter and Lizzy Caplan) from the season prior to BBT's debut. However, after the pilot episode, i was hooked. This was actually a show i could succinctly relate to...even on the slightest of margins(lol!). Granted, most of the jokes and humor in this show are intellectually biased--to say the very least, it somehow challenges even the most primitive of minds to think.<br /><br />Yes...you have four extremely intelligent guys, and one bodacious hottie, which could borderline on cliche, but the writers have thrown a proverbial curveball by allowing each of the characters to be vulnerable to humanity...or something like it. Brilliant acting by Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons as two friends of somewhat equivalent IQ who have a subtle competition for scientific acheivements, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar offer unabridged support as Leonard and Sheldon's colleagues both in the work place and the social world. The four seem to feed off of each other for advice in decision making, and other various social conundrums that most of the modern world tend to take for granted. Each of these guys bring a different perspective to the table and, to me, the show hinges on that alone. Add in Kaley Cuoco who really gives 110% as Penny who's fun-loving, yet level-headed enough to know when to draw the line. I really believe that she is the one factor that keeps the boys down to earth.<br /><br />To be quite candid, i'm usually disassociated with broadcast television in general, but this show has really got some potential. I just hope that corporate media gives this show a long enough time frame to prove itself.<br /><br />So far, we got three seasons...
B000E6EH1S|5.0|As ridiculous as MacLeod's assertion may be, it speaks volumes about what this recording has always meant to me. Of the dozens of recordings I have of the major 'war-horses' per se (Beethoven, Brahms and Mahler symphonies, Rachmaninov concerti, Baroque sewing machine music), this is the ONLY one I'll ever want.    Recorded in 1974, the most readily apparent characteristic of this reading is its momentum. Davis doesn't allow the orchestra to rest for a moment, creating tension whenever and where ever necessary. So many performances of 'Fantastique' lack the simple inertia to keep this score alive and the Dutch respond to Davis magically. The first movement, difficult to convey because of the orchestration parrying between sparse and complex, is performed with such ease and color; I simply have not heard a better first movement anywhere.    The second movement waltz, 'At the Ball', is absolutely gorgeous, especially with the added cornet. Anytime I hear this waltz without the cornet part, I'm ready to call the guilty conductor and ask him why he left it out. It simply cannot go without. Again the Concertgebouw performs this movement with such life and joy it dances off the disc!    The third movement is simply amazing. The english horn solo at the beginning and end (the shepherd's pipe) of the movement is forlorn, impassioned, lonely, it is what typifies a benchmark reading for this piece. The Berlioz bass drum at the end is perfect for the coming storm. In general, the Concertgebouw bass drum for this recording is right on. The depth, the bass, the power, it's perfect and perfectly played.  One of the better moments of the CD, the March to the Scaffold, is strictly paced here but the orchestra accentuates throughout and conveys a truly sinister scene. Listen to the bassoons and how they pierce the Concertgebouw acoustic like no other. Marvelous!    The last movement is the best Witch's Sabbath I know; the creepy beginning leading up to the ensuing Dies Irae is only just the beginning. The bells used in this recording I have yet to hear anywhere since and never on any disc before. They set the stage for some of the most frenzied and expertly played Berlioz in recorded history (I'm dead serious about this). The low brass Dies Irae is striking and never lets up. The prickly dance that interrupts the Dies shows us a level of execution the woodwinds of very few orchestras ever demonstrated. The sextuplets that lead up to the main fugue are incredible and their reaffirmation at the ending really make a statement about the greatness of this offering.    This recording is unparalleled. Because I love this music so much and Davis found the perfect orchestra for this recording session, I have not yet found a reason to buy another. It IS a benchmark for this work; it is an incontestable addition to anyone's music library.
B0019X3YXM|3.0|Ho hum.   I don't think anyone expected this to be as good as the original - but I think we all wanted it to resemble it's Korean counterpart.     I feel there were a little too many creative liberties taken... the story is a little bit far fetched- the acting wears a bit thin here and there- and the scenarios are entirely different. This was so distant from the Korean version that it was hard to believe the writers had watched it at all.     Vaguely humorous, a good effort at least, but definitely not as good as the first. :(
B00169N0BK|2.0|I am very involved in digital photography,making prints using Photoshop and Epson R2880 printer.I got Colormunki becaause of difficulty matching prints to images on Apple 23\\" Cinema Display. With Colormunki, problems calibrating the monitor. Printer profiling was easy, but the end result was no better than using the Epson profile. One customer support person implied the Apple display was not up to the job. Another said soft proofing was abolutely necessary. Colormunki provided no benefit for printer profiling and there are better products for monitor calibration.

B001K3JF7K|5.0|Being boring is the main point of Bossa Nova. The word \\"bossa\\" is derived from Boçal which means arrogant, a kind of behavior that denotes \\"I don't care\\". This behavior was common among those who started Bossa Nova. João Gilberto considered the Bossa Nova´s father is even more boring than Diana in this particular album. This been said, Diana´s work at this album is marvelous. Even not being Brazilian, she could understand the rhythm of Bossa Nova deeply.
B001K98MFK|4.0|I had the older version of \\"Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence\\" - the one without an English dub - and I looked forward to picking up this edition with the English dub.  Unfortunately, I was expecting a bit of new material.    Here, this \\"five-year-anniversary\\" edition fell very short.  The main extra on this edition - the \\"Making of Innocence\\" - was the same as the original DVD, and I didn't bother to check the audio commentary by the director and producer.    They did have new trailers for other Bandai products.  Whoop dee do.  Nothing else new here.    On the plus side, the new English audio -- done with the same cast as the \\"Stand Alone Complex\\" series -- made it a LOT easier to understand what was going on.  I remember watching Batou blink after the convenience store incident:  \\"Ohhh... THAT's Ishikawa.\\"  Ditto in the mansion later, when the mannequins stood up appearing to be Togusa and Batou - I didn't catch that until I heard the synthetic Togusa voice in the second pass.    A good film - this is how they should've done it in the first place.  I get the distinct impression they sold this edition just for the English dub.  Which really is a shame.  I wasted my money on the previous edition.

B001ILHY1I|4.0|\\"Death Race\\" is popcorn entertainment at it's best.  Back in my day they used to call this stuff drive-in fare.  Ironically, I never went to a drive-in probably because I couldn't drive.  In a nutshell I would say this flick is a hybrid of it's predecessor, \\"Death Race 2000\\", and \\"Escape From New York\\".  The action here is white-knuckle and virtually non-stop.  A real adrenaline rush this is.  Jason Statham cements his crown as an icon of the action genre.  Statham picks his vehicles well and \\"Death Race\\" is no exception.  Joan Allen plays against type and scores a ten as the tough-as-nails warden.  This flick may not be for everybody but it had me cheering.
B001GQACGE|3.0|This is the first new  CD I have purchased in many years.    I ONLY bought it because I like the song \\"Single Ladies\\".    Now, what is the deal with 2 CD's for 11 songs?    Waste, more work.    You have 2 CD's with additional material, a lot of songs, etc.    It was a good thing I found this on sale.    Black & white photos, 1 with a little color in it?  Oh boy.    Only SOME songs have the lyrics printed inside.
0321525655|5.0|This is an extraordinarily practical yet engaging and thought-provoking book. Beyond it's obvious uses by perpetrators of \\"Death by Powerpoint\\" (including me, alas), it's insights are relevant to how any person presents themselves.<br /><br />The book is concise and easy to read yet is full of useful references and examples. I've already made good use of the ideas in the book - from specific slide designs and stock photo sites to more abstract ideas about engaging the audience and Ben Zander's philosophy.
B000JQTWPO|3.0|Apparently this is the first detective novel in the English language.  This is a free edition.      Easy to read, not as much action as I expected from the wild plot premise -- a cursed Indian diamond.      Mostly it is of historical interest -- I did not find it gripping, and the humorous writing style is a little dated, but the prose is quite acceptable.       A worthy addition to one's Kindle library, though not something I would read over and over again.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I had been watching this series when I met my husband. Shortly there after they either moved the time or day it aired or my life changed somehow to where I couldn't watch it any more. We have some friends that had the first 4 Seasons on DVD. Every time we went there my husband was confused. So I borrowed 2 of the seasons and my husband changed from confused to enjoying the show. So we bought the entire series and now it's something we can sit and watch together and enjoy when there's nothing else on TV. It's nice to have something so simple to bring some closeness to a couple for a few hours. It's really a nice set. The box is great and the way the seasons are listed you can't possibly get lost where you let off. I haven't seen 100% of it so I'm not to sure about all extras they've add in these. But my personal belief is it can only help with the show. There was so much going on in the actors personal lives that was brought into the series this will help explain who/what/why.  Any one who has a slight interest in what life in the White House might be like this is for you.
0743455967|5.0|Mr. King acknowledges the success of his first book, Carrie, was equivalent to hitting the lottery. He never had nor ever will have some master plan for making gobs of money in the publishing world. The very talented author is just fortunate that he loves to write and has a large enough audience for him to make a living at it. This book is not about how you can become a bestselling author, but on getting in touch with your creativity.<br /><br />Mr. King gives the reader a funny, down-to-earth description of how he goes about the process. Beyond urging all aspiring writers to read The Elements of Style by Strunk & White, he doesn't hold hard and fast to many dictates. Before describing his approach, the author gives brief snapshots of his life prior to hitting it big. After the meat and potatoes of the book, Mr. King concludes with his near-death and recovery from being struck by a careless driver in 1999. A self-edited portion of a manuscript tucked at the end of the book is priceless. A truly encouraging pitch to tap into your creative juices just for the sheer fun of it.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|Je suis trop jeune pour pouvoir comparer ce qu'à pu être les années 60 mais une chose est certaine il s'agit d'une très bonne série.  Le rythme est lent, les couleurs sont superbes, la musique est très bonne et attaché de très près à l'image.  Les thèmes approchés sont très intéressants, on passe de la politique, des femmes au foyers, des différences raciales, de pouvoir, d'ambition, d'homosexualité, etc.  avec un peu de mystère ici et là...    J'écoute beaucoup de série et je pense que celle-ci comporte plusieurs très bons acteurs, tout est très bien joué et convaincant, pour cette raison je peux comparer effectivement avec la série \\"Six Feet Under\\" comme un autre l'a déjà dit ici.
0060833459|5.0|You know you read the writing of great thinker when the line of text in front of you is simple and yet powerful. Peter Drucker writes like that. The Effective Executive is one of those books that wake up your intellect: simple, unpretentious, direct, based on experience and well practiced art of detecting underlying principles hiding behind our mundane tasks.<br /><br />Effective managers, according to Peter, follow eight principles:<br />- Ask \\"what needs to be done?\\"<br />- Ask \\"what is right?\\"<br />- Develop action plans<br />- Take responsibility for decisions<br />- Take responsibility for communicating<br />- Focus on opportunity rather than problem<br />- Run productive meetings<br />- Think and say \\"we\\" rather than \\"I\\"<br /><br />I like for instance how he describes the taking of responsibility for decisions: a decision has not been made until people know: the name of the person accountable for carrying it out, the deadline, the names of the people who will be affected by it, and the names of the people who will be informed. Simple, isn't it?<br /><br />A penetrating observation is that in large organisations people tend to be absorbed by what happens inside its boundaries and by perfecting a process regardless of the outside world. The removal of the executive from the customer base is fatal in the long run.<br /><br />Other thought that I liked is that the effective executive does not make decisions by consensus, but by what is right, even if the decision is not popular. The executive makes a few decisions, but powerful, rather than many razzle-dazzle decisions.<br /><br />I have this book handy, so that when I have time, I choose to read randomly a page or two. It's like doing meditation. It is simple, elegant and very sharp. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject.
0316017922|5.0|I read \\"The Tipping Point\\" by Gladwell and like his approach to understanding our complex world.  As we look at a sequence of events and wonder why, Gladwell spends the time to try to understand.  I think his observation in the Outliers of how and why athletes successes are linked to their birthdays was fascinating.  And then he links that to the amount of time successful people work their craft was not only surprising but it made a lot of sense and made me feel better for my mediocre life.  I read a lot about 2 books per week.  About 1 in 5 is a serious read, most are fictional, international thrillers.  I also have a theory on how to read business books and that is to read the first 50 pages and skim the titles of the rest of the chapters and you will do just fine.  But you can't do that with this book or you would miss a lot of good stuff.  5 stars.      Len Bertain, Ph.D.  len@bertain.com

0312360266|5.0|When I first started this book I realized it was for teens but what the heck I was going to read it anyway.  Boy, am I glad that I did.  This novel is well written and structured.  I empathasized with the heroine immediately cause I can remember that far back and the teenaged emotions of the time.  This young lady is up to date with the times but she has the same struggles with friends, morality, sex and school as we had in the 60ies.  Zoey always seems to end up on the right side.  Sometimes it is not easy for her being a vamp and a teenager but she stumbles but always ends up doing the right thing.  I found this book entertaining and amusing and immediately ordered the other 4.
B001C4CI8U|2.0|This show has many elements that I enjoy.  It offers episodes of stories exploring 'fringe' science (that they obviously don't completely explain, it's not meant to be) and presents puzzles for the fans.  Based on the theme and stories alone, the series seems solidly above average.  It's a show that I feel that I should like, but just can't.  After watching a few episodes, there is one major aspect of the show that I don't like... the characters.  The character of Peter Bishop especially strikes me as, essentially, a very contrived jerk.  I don't know if that's just the way it's written, or if it's Joshua Jackson's personality coming through, but I don't like it at all.  That alone, in my opinion, was enough to make the show crumble.  The second problem is with Olivia Dunham, who just seems to 'float' through the episodes.  I don't sense any depth there.  From my perspective, the show solely rests on the shoulders of Dr. Walter Bishop, Phillip Broyles, and the bald guy.  They're just not enough to pull it off though.  The show feels the same to me as 'Eureka', which was another show I felt was just interesting enough to waste time watching.  However, if I were comparing them directly, Eureka would slightly win with 3 stars versus 2 to 2.5 stars for Fringe.    I hope this helps.
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|If you're even considering this movie, you SHOULD have some interest in the subject material already - torture, degradation, murder and the like. Besides that, there is no reason to watch this really....I rented it because it was on  Entertainment Weekly's \\"25 most distubing movies ever\\" list and of course I had to check it out. I thought nothing could top Cannibal Holocaust as far as the gross factor, but Salo definitely wins out. Like I said, NOT for weak stomachs or those unable to separate the movie from their emotions.<br /><br />The basic plot is that a group of young Jews are kidnapped and brought to the circle of friends for \\"fun\\". The movie is subtitled in English, but I think the points come across just the same. The teens are forced into all kinds of disgusting and horrifying situations, all the while the circle of friends (consisting of 4 very disturbed older men) enjoy every last moment of it. Think of the sickest things you can do to a person, and they are more than likely in this movie. Things I have never even thought of were shown without remorse or attemps at hiding what was happening.<br /><br />I give this movie 4 stars for the sheer ballsy-ness of those involved in the movie. The subject matter is very disturbing indeed, but you cant knock a movie like this for that because you have a good idea going into it. Some of it drags on at times, but at the same time I was not in any hurry to get to the next scene lol. ONLY watch if you have a morbid curiosity and can tolerate the depictions.
1568987846|5.0|I've been coveting this book for some time now and finally got around to ordering it. It almost has a Scandinavian aesthetic. As an introvert, I appreciate their quiet sense of seeing their surroundings and how the smallest of things resonate and become objects of beauty when you live calmly and beautifully in your home.  Well-done.
1594481717|5.0|First, let's get something out of the way. The whole left-brain, right-brain dichotomy is an oversimplification.<br /><br />But the human brain is so incredibly complex that we need useful models to think about it, and left-brain vs. right-brain is a useful one. There really are two different general classes of brain activities, with procedural, logical, analytic processes in one class, and inductive, pattern recognition, and intuitive processes in another. Everyone uses both kinds, but some people lean more on one or the other class for their work and daily life.<br /><br />The main point of the book is that we are leaving an era in which left-brain-leaning knowledge workers are the high-value workers with secure careers. Procedural work can be automated or outsourced. It's much harder (perhaps impossible) to automate design, emphathizing with users to discover what they need, and seeing abstract patterns in complex venues.<br /><br />However, pure right-brain thinking is not enough. Ideas have to be validated and weighed in cost-benefit terms. So those who will thrive in the new world, according to Pink, are those who effectively use both sides of their mind. That's where the book's title comes from.<br /><br />Working in the software world, I see the effects of left-brain-leaning thinkers, because most software developers fit that description. Ever wondered why most software has a horrible user interface? Software developers don't tend to be good at the kind of thinking required to get inside the mind of users (empathy) and figure out what they really need and like, or to come up with brand new patterns of user interaction to fit new requirements.<br /><br />But software is changing. New technologies allow more visual feedback, which then requires more and better design skills to use those technologies. The Internet world is highly complex, so seeing patterns and responding to them is important.<br /><br />The book isn't specifically about software, but I kept getting ideas about the software world from the concepts discussed in the book. That's why I kept scribbling in the margins.<br /><br />I even went back through the book a second time just to capture in a separate document the various ideas that flowed while reading the first time.<br /><br />If you're an \\"idea\\" person, I think you'll like this book. If you're a left-brain-leaning knowledge worker, I think you owe it to yourself to think about how to exercise and develop more of your right-brained capabilities. The book has lots of useful exercises for that.concepts discussed in the book. That's why I kept scribbling in the margins.

B001FB55MG|3.0|Bedtime Stories is almost really good.  In fact, it's almost really a lot of things.  For instance, it's almost really a good movie for kids and almost really funny. It's not quite good, funny, or a movie for kids, but it comes so darn close.<br /><br />Here is what works in Bedtime Stories:<br /><br />Bedtime Stories stars Adam Sandler, who is always likable though generally inane and crude as well. In this case, Sandler toned down the frat-house humor that so hollowed the movie Click.  He turns in his usual affable performance in Bedtime Stories.<br /><br />Russell Brand, who is charismatic though not very versatile, also comes on strong as Sandler's quirky friend.<br /><br />Richard Griffiths, a.k.a. Vernon Dursley of Harry Potter fame, and Courtney Cox also turn in a decent performances... but don't look for any of them to receive an Oscar any time soon.<br /><br />The storyline is great fun--Skeeter Bronson (Sandler) is lowly but talented schlep satisfied with a work-a-day job in a growing hotel.  His life is changed when he agrees to take in his sister's two children while she applies for work in another state.<br /><br />When Skeeter begins making up bedtime stories for the kids, he finds his inventions coming true in the real world.  A good premise.<br /><br />So why is Bedtime Stories only \\"almost\\" good?<br /><br />In the tradition of all things Sandler, Bedtime Stories falls back on tried and true silliness instead of trusting itself.  The movie includes a string of jokes about a hamster with over-sized eyes.  Fortunately, Disney, of course, stripped out the crude humor that so often shows up in Sandler movies.<br /><br />The additional cast.  I'm sorry but the formula Sandler and Keri Russell did not work.  They did not play off each other.  Sandler and Drew Barrymore had energy.  Sandler and Julie Bowen were great.  Sandler and Russell... not so much.<br /><br />In addition, Sandler has this pathological need to keep an entourage of auxiliary cast member--most notably and dependably bad would be Rob Schneider but there are others.<br /><br />In the end, Bedtime Stories is mildly fun and predictably happy.  For this movie, Disney has taken the edge off Sandler without giving him substance..    In the end, Bedtime Stories is mildly fun and predictably happy.

1556900236|4.0|I became interested in this book after seeing it referenced in another book I was reading (Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing).  I no sooner finished \\"Newjack\\" and I came across a copy of \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" on audio cassette.<br /><br />I have to begin by saying that I can not say enough about Susan Adams narrating this book.  A girlish quality in her voice really allowed me get lost in this audio book and make me feel like I really was listening to Anne Frank.  Ms. Adams was easy to understand and was an excellent reader.<br /><br />As strange as it may sound to some people, even though I am highly educated, I had never heard of this book prior to seeing it referenced in another book I was reading.  I did some brief research on the book and it seemed like it would be a great and highly unique account of World War 2.<br /><br />The story is about Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl who was living in Amsterdam during Nazi Germany occupation.  The story begins at the age of 13, when she is still free to go about her life.  She offers some excellent insight on what restrictions the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands had on Jewish people.  She then goes on outlining a plan her family has for going into hiding to avoid persecution.  Finally comes the day her family goes into hiding.  The rest of the book is a vivid description of what life is like constricted to an area that seemed to be about the size of a small town house.  Anne Frank gives colorful descriptions of having to live in close quarters with 7 other people, in constant fear of being found, dealing with food shortages, and having to worry about fires, bombs, and other atrocities of war.  During all this, Anne is able to go through many of the same things a young teen would go through today, a struggle to find their own identity, love, rebellion against parents, etc.<br /><br />I have to say the writing in the book is quite astounding.  The book works on many levels.  It offers a unique historical perspective on what it was like to be of the Jewish faith, hiding from the Nazis.  I thought it offers a great psychological perspective on a person's thoughts and actions when under stress a person's will to survive.<br /><br />The story has a timeless essence to it and will be as meaningful 200 years from now as it is today.  The thoughtfulness, eloquence, and meaningfulness of the writing is astounding, especially considering the source was a teenage girl.<br /><br />I have read enough in my life to know a fine piece of work when I see it.  This story is definitely a fine piece of work.  However, I have to admit I did not particularly like the story.  I did not know what to expect when I began this book, and I have to say I was slightly disappointed.  While a great piece of work, this just is not the type of story I would usually read.<br /><br />If you are interested in a unique perspective on war, this is definitely a book for you.  I would also highly recommend this to anyone who has a bomb shelter or might find themselves in a confined area for a long period of time with other people; this book is very insightful and talks about problems and issues I never would have thought of.  All in all, this was a great story, it just was not for me.<br /><br />If you are largely unfamiliar with the story of Anne Frank, I would recommend doing some quick research on her before beginning the book.  I was a bit lost in the beginning, but after I spent 15 minutes doing a little research on the history of Anne Frank, things made a lot more sense to me.hat it was like to be of the Jewish faith, hiding from the Nazis.

B001BEK8E2|5.0|This is a brilliantly told and acted film. And it leaves you thinking about what really happened, long after the film has ended. Kurosawa was a master and this film is a good reason why. I highly recommend it.
B0002V7OI8|4.0|I can only say that I strongly second the opinions of all customers who gave this film high marks, who felt it was far superior to 'Armageddon', and who vehemently disagree with David Chute's review which is, unfortunately, the first opinion people see when they come to the Amazon page(s) on this movie.    I've seen this film several times now and I never cease to be stirred, excited, and moved by it. The writing and characterizations have unusual depth for a big studio, big budget disaster movie, and the acting is uniformly excellent, with several performances -- Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvaal, Vanessa Redgrave, Tea Leoni, and Maximilian Schell -- being especially memorable.    Yes, it has some of the elements of soap opera and melodrama and yet manages, somewhat miraculously, to transcend them in its overall effect.    This is, truly, a refreshingly real-feeling disaster epic with a surprisingly \\"deep impact\\".

B001R7IHA0|5.0|As usual, Keith has done an amazing job with this album.  Every song sounds heart-felt and sincere.

This is a CD that can be listened to over and over.   Can't wait to see what Keith does with the songs on tour!
B0000259CP|2.0|As a true child of the sixties, I remember Pet Sounds when it came out, and as a 13 year old kid I loved it. It is a very good pop album. As some kind of musical revelation, it is mediocre.     It shows just far we have fallen from the level of musical knowledge that even my parents enjoyed that anyone thinks that this is interesting musically, not just as a pop sensation. The sudden modulations, the weird recording studio gestures, the introduction of irrelevant and quirky non-typical \\"pop\\" instruments are sophomoric and jejeune.     An objective listener with even a basic knowledge of classical music finds this album boring. The unusual chords and modulations are hardly surprising to someone who has been exposed to classical music after Brahms. Only in comparison to the three chord, 16 bar drivel of its time (and ours) is this in any way interesting. \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\" etc. are great pop classics. The rest of this album: pretentious, silly and poorly crafted.

B001LRJH0U|3.0|This is a superbly acted and beautifully filmed film.  The pacing is a little slow, especially when compared to most Westerns out there but the writing is top notch.  It is a drama with compelling characters.  The characters in the film and their relationships with another are deep and I found myself glued to the screen.  The action scenes that were in the film were quick but satisfying.  The only problem for me is that with all the build up throught out the film and all the time spent on character development, I wasn't quite satisfied with how everything wrapped out.  Still worth a watch and nice to see a well made Western which isn't the same as all the others.

I was mesmerized and filled with open-eyed excitement as I watched this movie. I didn't know that it was welling me up for the downpour of tears to come later. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I love any type of foreign movie with accents and good storylines anyway, 10 times better than American movies. I had wanted to see this movie at the theater, but couldn't get to see it while it played. I finally rented it a couple of weeks ago and watched it late at night (a.m. hours). I didn't blink an eye towards falling asleep during the whole thing. I was truly satisfied and now I plan to buy it for whenever I can use a good cry and get entertained at the same time.(LOL) I also didn't read or missed reading comments here about anything concerning the \\"little guy\\" in this film. He was PHENOMENAL! His role/character made this movie for me. Without him, I don't think I would have loved it as much. For those who say they hated this movie, all I can say is, \\"You just didn't get it.\\"  I supposed that can happen sometimes. For those who loved it...I'll say, \\"Good on 'ya\\".

0743289692|3.0|The author has to settle a score with Islam, especially with the Islam dealing with women. The accusations are not new, but they are concerning whenever an eyewitness and victim is reporting about her own experiences. In this case the author has not only her own story to relate, she is also a person of public interest, guest in many talk shows, an educated woman, not thanks to Islam education, but to a life in the ideological freedom only found in the West. She had to submerge after the assassination of Theo van Gogh who criticized Islam too much for the taste of some radical Muslims.<br />It is difficult to contradict her arguments against the Islamic treatment of women. If this is Islam, saying woman has only one purpose to satisfy the needs of man, then the women of the world can cerebrate whether this is something they would like to have. Ayaan says no.<br />She says that the integration of Muslims must fail mainly because of the woman-hostile religion and culture of Islam. She could prevent herself from being forcefully married only by escape. No woman should be a production plant for sons but decide herself about her life. A bad joke that anybody has to say a word like this in the 21. century!<br />With her critics against Islam she is the most endangered person in the Netherlands, getting constant death threats. The muslims cannot be tolerant in that. She broke too many taboos, she did not only criticize the Islam as a religion, she also rejected Islam and converted to a non-muslim. Who wonders?<br />Her analyzes are sharp like the edge of a sword. She says that the first element of Islam is the relation of the Muslim to his God dictated by fear, because Allah punishes offences to his requirements. The second element is Muhammad as the only source of moral for a Muslim. But he was a man of the 7th century, thus Islam is backward oriented. The third element is the dominion of a sexual moral of old Arabian customs which entails a certain conduct towards women. And these three elements explain the backwardness of Islam.<br />\\"In only taking over the technical achievements of the West and not the western courage to self-established thinking the spiritual stagnation of the Islamic culture is abiding\\".<br />No news! In fact there are many educated muslims who think the same. But they are blind for the fact that Islam cannot accept the successes of non-islam societies! The Quran and Muhammads compatible Hadiths stand against it. It is true that the author is exaggerating when she is writing: \\"The most important explanation for the spiritual and material residue in which we Muslims are, is in the sexual moral.\\"<br />Is it believable when she confesses she would be optimistic that there are reforms which will take advantage of the accomplishments of the West?<br />She does not confess Islam at all. At first she realized: \\"The more religious I became, the more I lied and cheated.\\" On lies and fake the whole of Islam was build, we hear. This again is a less helpful exaggeration.<br />Change everything what she wanted to and you do not get Islam. For her the sole reading of the \\"Atheistic manifest\\" is sufficient to give her the last kick to convert to non-Islam and instantly become the opponent of the fear- and oppression religion.<br />This again seems to be nothing but a superficial \\"conversion\\". Not everybody, who is disappointed in his religion leaves the belief in a higher authority behind, as if the proof that a man-made God is good for nothing is also the proof that there is no God at all! This has to be called inconsequent thinking. But this is not what the book is about.<br />The author is also asserting that preaching of hatred against Jews and other non-muslims is belonging to the standard program of Quran schools. She is right to say that hatred against the West is not only due to the economical and cultural successes of the West in comparison to the muslim world, but also due to religious reasons. In this she is rightto go over the description of Bernard Lewis about the crisis of Islam.<br />She is consequently contradicting the political \\"correct\\" statements of the politicians that Islam is just misused from islamists and taken into custody by them. \\"Islam has taken itself into custody!\\" Thus not the interpretation of Islam is the problem, as if all muslims were fools, instead Islam is the problem! She is asking:<br />\\"If we Muslims are so tolerant and friendly, why then is there in Islamic countries so much ethnical, religious, political and cultural brokenness and violence. Why are we Muslims so full of feelings of anger and discomfort and carry so much hostility and hatred in us? Why do we not succeed in questioning ourselves?\\" This is in fact a good question, and to question oneself is moreover a very clever question!<br />She is dedicating a whole chapter to the necessity of self-reflexion. A very important perception! The question remains what the result of the self-reflexions of people should be, of people who are listening their whole lives long \\"truths\\". Everybody needs to have his own traumatic experience! And even this is not always sufficient, because:<br />\\"If I had to characterize Islam I should have to say, that it has become like the father of Atta (of the chief terrorist of 11.9.):  wrathful, traumatized, shaken and captured in delusion\\". That everybody uses his own traumas to get free from his delusion! At least, the author seems to have made it!<br />She is also asking the question whether this God in which she believed failed. And she is answering with the failure of man: \\"We Muslims have lost the balance between religion and reason totally out of sight. The results are poverty, violence, political instability, economical stagnation and human misery.\\" In this context she is citing Islam expert Lewis, which she seems to have read carefully.<br />Broad space is given to the description of the role of the women in Islam. Rightly she is talking about her own experiences. That in the Islamic cultural realm the human rights have been tread with feet is well known. What is the author demanding for?<br />Basically western conditions. But this is the same as the abolishment of Islam! But Islam`s commandments fort he life-style of the fidels is not separable of the more abstract teaching (Allah is the only one and Muhammad is his prophet, etc.). Islam rules and regulates everything and herein is without compromises! Additional is the strong tradition serving in some countries for the mutilation of the genitals. Here she should have better fairly separated Islam and tradition.<br />Be that as it may, it has to be feared that the call of the author is not heard from those who should hear it. She is invoking muslim women to demand their rights, especially their rights of self-determination. This seems to be a pious wish, because for many women their life is just about the bare survival, not so much about submission. Islam means \\"submission\\"!! Islam simply does not grant the right for self-determination. If religion is sometimes not reasonable you have to oppose with:  humans do not always want to be reasonable at all! Thus it is not a wonder that they do not demand from their religion that it is a reasonable one!<br />Freedom is a question of decision! Yes, but also of possibilities and chances! Not everybody is d`accord with the battle cry:  \\"Freedom or death!\\" The author is even designing a plan for muslim women to run away!<br />Islam is also therefore a phenomenon because it fosters so many anachronisms and yet it survives and has millions of followers. But to get to know the freedom which the author experienced and treasured - this is exactly what many people do NOT want! Not everybody has such an unquenched drive for freedom as the author, not every woman in Islam has made bad experiences. And many even like to be the subordinates of a man!<br />Sometimes there seems to break through a piece of naivet&eacute; and smart-aleckybesides the much too latent outrage and the missionary self-consciousness of the author. One should, she says, adapt faith to realities, Muslims should realize the incompleteness of their faith etc.<br />And then she steps on totally alien ground in her exuberance: \\"In fact there are also misogynistic texts in the Bible and in the Talmud\\". And many Christians and Jews had shown that \\"many of the texts in the Bible and in the Talmud are good for nothing\\".<br />Such unqualified, not proved and polemic platitudes devaluate what she rightly has to say. Not all her comments are showing a clear view.<br />Her concern should not be understood as a sweeping blow against all religions. Ayaan is just a feminist!<br />Who is going to read the book? The best is Muslims who really have a serious interest that women in Islam are not oppressed or abused. And non-Muslims, who want to be informed about the topic. They get a lot of information from the insider about the ruling deficiencies in Islam. In the West it is well known how to make wars for the sake of suppressed peoples - but for one half of the peoples, the women, the West is doing next to nothing.<br />You should also hear others who have studied the matter about the epistemic statements of the author. The comments of a frustrated and - rightfully - disgusted woman are not enough. Nevertheless, no doubt, here you read a personal accounting of a courageous woman. More such courageous women are needed in the world, there are enough cowards! It was high time, that this was said what she had to say. And the so called free world should take it into consideration, even when the muslim world does not do it.<br />This book is readable mostly, it has weaknesses which lie in the simplifications and the digressions into fields where she is amateurish.

0767821629|5.0|A movie that will challenge your perception of what you think is your reality. Is anything real or are you just a holographic program...as hinted in \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy. I found this movie on video several years ago, and in watching it again, decided the DVD was a must. Definitely a movie for my library. I am very selective about what I buy. I so enjoy movies that challenge your mind to question what has been taken for granted. If you liked \\"The Matrix\\", here is another mind bender for you.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I truly enjoy Diana and her creativity at interpreting the classic American Songbook and popular classics.  However, this \\"breathy\\" approach leaves me wondering what was she thinking?  Where is the inventive, inspired, rhythmic  approach to her jazzy, unique style?  This recording appears to be one owed to the record company and their demands to water it down to appeal to as many mainstream easy listeners as possible.  Diana, please return to your style so amazingly displayed in your brilliant Paris concert.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|Quite a bold move, for an established rock star to hook up with a pop/hip-hop producer for his new album.  But it's OK.  It works.  It's still Chris Cornell.  He's got the same good voice (with some assistance), lots of magnetism and things to express.  That's what makes him interesting.  The collaboration with Timbaland just gives him a different soundscape to operate from, if you can be open to it.  Machine beats, layers of string-like synths, rippling keyboards and electronic beeps - these are just other musical instruments, and they are the basis for much of today's music.  Once you adjust to that, the album moves along nicely, interwoven with other diverse sounds.  (For instance, &#34;Take Me Alive&#34; features East Indian sitars and an exotic beat.)  The tracks in general have a good SOUND, although it's not a ROCK SOUND, and the lyrics are interesting enough.  He sings about infidelity (&#34;Part Of Me&#34;), a relationship he won't give up on (&#34;Take Me Alive&#34;), a relationship that needs chilling (&#34;Scream&#34;), and a very &#34;fast&#34; girl (&#34;Watch Out&#34;).  He also sings about how hard life is in today's world.  In &#34;Get Up&#34;, he urges us to be strong and make the most of it.  &#34;Ground Zero&#34; is less optimistic:  &#34;When all the world keeps holding on to ground zero...it's every man for himself...The war that rages over the ages, you can't erase it.&#34;<br /><br />I'm happy with this experimental CD.  I enjoy getting something different from a familiar artist.  It awakens me from the stupor of hearing the same music that I hear on the radio all day, every day.  The way I see it, the choice is to go with the flow and get new music, or just keep listening to old music.  Myself, I need new music to supplement the old.
0861714911|5.0|In the west, those of us who have begun to investigate Buddhism will have probably read several readily available, mass-marketed books by semi-celebrity Buddhists. Many of these are very good, and very useful. Eventually, if you are serious about understanding Buddhism, you will have to read these discourses from the Pali Canon. All of the beautiful parables you've seen referenced or paraphrased in other introductory books are here, in all of their simple, wonderful, insightful glory.     It is important to get to the source of Buddhism. To begin to understand it, this is a good place to start. 'In the Buddha's Words' is a beautiful, well-organized, and indispensable resource.

B001PPLIEQ|2.0|Quantum of Solace, compared to Casino Royale - that stupendous franchise reboot in 2006 - is a huge disappointment. What's more, it's  underwhelming. James Bond should never be underwhelming.<br /><br />Unlike most, I thought this entry was pretty decent. Although it needed to slice out three-fourths of the action, replace it with plot and bump up the running time to about two hours, I wasn't pissed off at the end result. To quote Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, \\"Suppose that's something.\\"<br /><br />There's been much criticism about the controversial \\"shaky cam\\" cinematographic technique. The action sequences are indeed ineptly shot but they're not too hard to follow. The problem is there's so many of them that it becomes ridiculous. Apparently Michael G. Wilson/Barbara Broccoli/Marc Forster felt that five full minutes of dialogue might bore the audience so it would need to be punctuated by car chases, rooftop flights, fisticuffs, speed boating, DC-3 dogfights and a shootout intercut with Tosca.<br /><br />Peter Lamont, production designer since 1981's For Your Eyes Only (absent just from 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies) and Daniel Kleinman, main titles designer since 1995's Goldeneye have been replaced by two far less talented individuals. The picture looks cheap in places (despite being the most expensive installment of all) and the faux-retro opening credits are terrible.<br /><br />At first I derided the Jack White/Alicia Keys theme 'Another Way To Die' as excruciating but eventually discovered it improves with enough listens. This is far from the nadir of 1974's 'The Man With The Golden Gun'.<br /><br />Prickly, blistering guitars suffuse a delirious soundscape of bleating horns and skittish piano chords. White/Keys' aural cacophony and inane lyrics may pale in comparison to Chris Cornell's red-blooded dazzler 'You Know My Name' but their song remains a mild success.<br /><br />Paul Haggis/Neal Purvis/Robert Wade handed in their collaborative script juuuuuust before the writer's strike deadline and it shows (why no one felt compelled to tinker with it after the strike is beyond me). The plot is insignificant (stealing Bolivia's water supply - ZOMG!) and the roles are underwritten. Sadly, this even includes Daniel Craig's.<br /><br />Olga Kurylenko (Camille) and Gemma Arterton (\\"Strawberry\\" Fields, whose ultimate fate is a strange homage to 1964's Goldfinger) are two of 007's least memorable ingenues. In fact, I'd go so far as to call Judi Dench (M) the film's true Bond girl. Mathieu Amalric (playing Dominic Greene with bug-eyed sleaze) is such a great foil that his character especially would have benefited from being fleshed out.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Greene's lair - Perla De Las Dunas - is perhaps the dumbest of the series. This is a giant, vacant hotel (or as I like to call it, the Hindenburg on land) nonsensically located in the middle of the desert. What's more, it's powered by hydrogen fuel cells instead of solar energy. Naturally, the entire cardboard set blows sky high within seconds of Bond's arrival. It makes even less sense than that laughable giant cargo jet in 2002's Die Another Day.<br /><br />To its credit, Quantum of Solace moves along at a relatively brisk pace, David Arnold once again turns in a haunting score (which inexplicably doesn't use the Bond theme) and Daniel Craig is still excellent as the world's greatest spy. If only he'd been given better material to work with this time around.<br /><br />Those looking for cinematic proficiency can take solace in the heartrending death scene of an amiable protagonist; its counterpoint is the limp d*ck resolution of the Vesper subplot.the writer's strike deadline and it shows (why no one felt compelled to tinker with it after the strike is beyond me).

Soft vocals and the music harmonies remind me of some of the Beatles slow songs. At times, words in the songs are sort of poignant and incredibly touching.  I listened to other Cold Play samples on line and I definitely think it is an extraordinary group.

B001NERPHS|5.0|In 1970 The Band released their third studio album Stage Fright. The title track was a thinly vailed homage to Bob Dylan...\\"See the man with the stage fright just standin' up there to give it all his might. But he got caught in the spotlight and when you get to the end he wants to start all over again\\".     Conspicuiously absent from the music world,  Bob Dylan had become reclusive, hiding out in upstate New York with a rag-tag outfit that hailed from parts of Canada and Arkansas. The Hawks had been touring for four plus years under Ronnie Hawkins and had played juke joints and dives with little or almost no real success. So when the opportunity came along to join Bob Dylan on tour, it was a no-brainer and the rest as they say is history. Performing \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"Maggies Farm\\" and \\"Subterainian Homesick Blues\\", they did a better than adaquate job as a back-up unit. But the audience wanted no part of this sellout, \\"Electric-Bob\\". They had come to hear \\"Blowing In The Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are A Changin'\\".     At the end of the tour Bob Dylan suffered major injuries resulting from a motorcycle accident. And so he retreated and rejoined The Hawks in a house called \\"Big Pink\\" in West Saugerties, NY. The Hawks, now called The Band were begining work on their first studio album. With two covers by Dylan, \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and \\"Wheels On Fire\\" and several new songs by fledging songwriter Robbie Robertson,  The Band began to take shape.    It was during The Big Pink sessions, that Bob and The Band started work on the songs he wrote while convalescing. This new material was a natural outgrowth of the kind of songs featured on John Wesley Harding. \\"Yazoo Street Scandal\\", \\"Low And Behold\\" and \\"Bessie Smith\\" are all quitessential tales of Americana circa early twentith century. The songs are filled with carnival barkers and circus performers, small time thiefs and bootleggers, riverboat pilots and gamblers, madames and corrupt politicians. Such characters could have been created by the likes of Samuel Langhorn Clements aka Mark Twain. I can certainly see old Mark Twain decked out in one his ivory linen suits, chompin' on a big cigar and toe tapping to \\"Apple Suckling Tree\\". Why even O'Henry might take a liken' to \\"Million Dollar Bash\\" or \\"Don't Ya' Tell Henry\\".    So here we are forty years removed from those magical sessions. The old wax grooves have been sonicly cleansed so as to remove all the hiss and distortion, (I'm not so sure that was a good idea). But I must admit the results are startling.    Afterall it's as Bob said, \\"Nothing Was Delivered....Take care of yourself and get pleanty of rest\\". Yes friends these are trying times indeed and we all need to take care of our mental hygiene. I personnaly recommend a nice hot toddy, a big cushy easy chair and a double dose of The Basement Tapes. Try to imagine yourself a fly on the wall up in Big Pink in West Saugerties, NY....\\"If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait\\"....Then again it's just \\"Odds and Ends\\"... \\"Lost time is not found again\\".

Diana, we still love you...come back!
B001K3JF7K|3.0|There's little here that would represent the fantastic, breathtaking, smoky-club interpretations that Krall once made her bones upon. Here, in this project, she adopts a very whispery, far less smoky voice that will likely dissatisfy those seeking more of 'vintage Krall.'<br /><br />The arrangements are very slow in tempo and she is accompanied thin, mostly very light strings. In fact, the accompaniment arrangements were reminiscent of soft 1960ish tunes from the 101 Strings Orchestra ... with about 90 of the strings in absentia. (That even though there's actually a 60-piece orchestra in place.) But you can also call it a sultry soft Latin vibe, if you wish.<br /><br />Mellow is a gross understatement of the mood set by the numbers in this project; imagine this collection as best suited for helping you drift off in your easy chair late at night after a healthy dose of merlot. Music you will hear in the background ... but not really notice or remember.<br /><br />Each number - a well chosen piece - is interpreted the exact same way, so each of this diverse set of tunes ends up sounding almost exactly alike.<br /><br />And, surprisingly, I am quite sure I heard Krall lose her way from the music at one point early on during \\"Where or When.\\"<br /><br />All of this will surely lead some to assume that Krall just dropped by the studio one day fresh out of a long nap and then dealt these deliveries out while stretched out on a couch in the green room. Of course that's not anywhere near the truth - she surely worked hard to shape these interpretations -  but just the same, that's the resulting impression.<br /><br />Obviously this project was intended to apply an extremely alternate interpretation of the genre ... and, bottom-line, the project cannot truly be called a total success. Yes it may have been the love child of Krall, Tommy LaPuma and legendary conductor/arranger Claus Ogerman, but it's STILL not a success. (Check out \\"Gate of Dreams\\" for an un-cut dose of Ogerman)<br /><br />Krall's been quite successful in accomplishing this interpretation, it's more that this type of interpretation probably didn't really need to be done by Krall.

0596522347|5.0|We can all think of at least one presentation that captivated the audience, or swept us off our feet, and yet, why is it that most of the time we end up itching to get out of that meeting and get on with our day? Slide:ology is a great addition for your personal or professional libraries. After all, it is not about the slides, it's about effective communication: create ideas, not slides!<br /><br />Nancy Duarte does a great job of walking the reader through the concepts and examples of some of the most effective presentations: captivate with ideas, know your graphics, adopt a consistent visual style, get rid of your bullet points! Remember, it's not about you, it's about the audience, and you have to come prepared. There is no magic bullet for a great presentation: prepare well in advance, distill the message, deliver. A powerpoint deck is only a tool that assists you, but it can have a great impact. Slide:ology will help you avoid the mistakes, and more importantly, get you down the path of crafting ideas, not slides.
B001N3OCV6|3.0|Despite its flaws, Zack Snyder's adaptation of Watchmen was more than likely the most faithful take on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' classic that we'd ever be able to get, right down to the music.  The Watchmen soundtrack is an eclectic mix, featuring everything from Nat King Cole to Leonard Cohen, and classic tracks from Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix.  There's nothing bad here, even though I'm not necessarily too fond of My Chemical Romance's cover of \\"Desolation Row\\", but there isn't anything you either don't already somehow have in your posession or haven't heard before.  Not to mention that other tracks you may expect here, like \\"99 Luftbaloons\\" and the Smashing Pumpkins' \\"The Beginning is the End is the Beginning\\" (which was featured so prominently in the film's first trailer) are absent.  Still, there's nothing necessarily wrong with the Watchmen soundtrack, but it's safe to say that this CD is best left for completists.  For the rest of us, check out Tyler Bates' haunting score, which is definitely worth picking up.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Being a huge Keith Urban fan I could not wait to get this album and listem too it.  Keith always has new inventive ways of pulling you in to his songs and once again I was not disappointed!!  This album is aussome and amazing!!  Every song tells a story and lets you in a little more on where Keith is in his life right now.  He is in such a great place and it is so good to hear how happy and joyful he is now!!  Now dont think this is not a rockin album filled with layers of electrifying guitar work because it is all of that and more!!  Keith has out done himself on this album...personal fave is \\"Till Summer Comes Around.\\"  It will be a huge hit for Urban and a concert fave!  There is something so haunting and mysterious about that song.  \\"If Ever I Could Love\\" is another great song...there are so many sounds and feelings to this song.  It has a Celtic/Irish sound to it...truly a super listen.  \\"Kiss A Girl\\" and \\"My Heart Is Open\\"...there are too many to mention but really all great.  Everyone please get a copy of this new album.  The best of the year!  Keith thanks for opening up your heart and sharing with us once again!
0375826726|3.0|I thought Chris Paolini's first book, Eragon, was one of the best new fantasies I'd read in ages. His second book, Eldest, was even better - the plot had more twists, the characters were more complex, and he explored different points of view. But his third book, Brisingr, didn't live up to my expectations.     Perhaps it was my fault rather than the book's - my life has changed since I read the first two installments, and I may have read the third from a different perspective. But I found the dialog unconvincing (particularly Eragon and Saphira's) and some of the descriptions tedious to the point of Tolkienism (I could have made my own sword in the time it took to read about Eragon forging his). Perhaps, if some of the description had been deleted, Paolini could have finished the trilogy as originally intended rather than dragging it on with a fourth book (and I will admit I am peeved that I didn't get the resolution I had wanted). Regardless, I fully intend to read number four when it comes out...
0316067601|5.0|I just could not put this book down! My heart was moved to hear him speak of the courage of his friends who gave their lives for each other and their country.<br /><br />We so ofter forget the price that is paid by the men and women who serve our country.
0061122416|2.0|The Alchemist is the tale of a shepherd boy who travels to Egypt in search of his Personal Legend. It's entertaining and provides interesting views on life that are worth pondering and discussing, but overall it struck me more as a spirituality/self-help book than a novel. And as with the few books I've read in this genre, like the Celestine Prophecy, I was left feeling I'd missed most of the metaphors and hidden messages within its pages. But I'm not particularly good at reading books that require analysis - I read for escapism and entertainment and I like rushing through the rollercoaster ride that most novels provide. So I'm probably not the most qualified person to review The Alchemist - but it is critically acclaimed and has apparently resonated with many readers around the world.
B0018BB21G|5.0|IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD is a great reissue of the Moody Blues' 1968 album. In addition to the 12 original songs, there are nine bonus cuts. The best songs here are the rocker \\"Ride My See-Saw\\" and the Timothy Leary ode \\"Legend Of A Mind\\", but there's other great stuff here as well. This album, along with any late 60s/early 70s Moody Blues album and the 1981 masterwork LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER, is essential for any fan of either the Moody Blues and/or progressive rock.
B001M6AHVS|5.0|This collection is so awesome, that the only bad thing I can think to say about it is; it ends with 1971 so there are no later Temptation hits (Pappa was a Rolling Stone, etc.)    For those of us who were around at the time, this collection immediately takes you back to then and there.  Some of these songs, I had never heard with the clarity in which they were originally recorded.    Nice \\"found items\\" too, like remembering that Rare Earth was one of the first, and only, predominantly white bands that recorded under the Motown label.    A must-buy for all of us geezers who grew up listening to the music that came out of Berry Gordy's garage/basement.
B000002O51|5.0|THIRD STAGE, Boston's third album, is about how a person matures once they reach their 30s. In a way, the album also reflects the changes I went through musically in my early 20s, going from being into mostly hard rock and metal to actually appreciating softer music by the time I hit 23. This album also reflects why I chose to skip my old school's food-related reunions in order to look good for a number of pretty actresses, as I came to realize that my high school days were a moment that, once over, could never possibly be recaptured. The only songs that don't fit this theme are the opener (\\"Amanda\\"), and the last two (\\"Cantcha Say\\" and \\"Hollyann\\"). If you buy this CD, it will inspire you to work hard to reach new levels of personal AND musical maturity.
B001TKA4IS|5.0|I am a psychologist-coach.  Having worked as a psychologist for 13 years I have found this book extremely useful in helping people to build a stronger sense of self-esteem and self-confidence.  The reason it is so useful is that it is based upon real strengths grounded in fact.  The research to establish this tool is very solid.  The Gallup organization used a large sample of people to assess diverse strengths.  Large corporations pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $1500 for 34 strengths top to bottom.  With this tool generally less than $21 you get your top 5 strengths. This can help people develop a business and a career around their strengths.  It is also very useful in helping people to develop a team around talents. I use it constantly in my coaching practice[...] and my business community building[...]. It can also help you with guiding your young adults into careers that make sense. Enjoy!  Charles Shinaver, PhD
B001JNNDAQ|2.0|The French Connection was and remains an immensely entertaining cops and drug smugglers film.  The movie is probably best remembered for Gene Hackman's manic car chase, during which Hackman appears to be oblivious to both his own safety and that of the citizens of the densely populated city he is sworn to protect. However spectacular that scene may have been, it was far down the list of the film's best moments. These come, ironically, in the slower scenes, such as the unauthorized stakeout during which Popeye and his partner doggedly pursue evidence against a suspected small time drug dealer.  All in all, the film is an excellent portrayal of the gritty, dirty world of drug law enforcement.    That's the good news.  The bad news is that the print quality of the blu-ray disk is virtually indistinguishable in most scenes from a standard definition DVD.  Worse, in some places (Particularly the night and low light scenes)the added definition of blu-ray actually seems to emphasize the graininess and soft focus of the film.  In short it's a great movie but an inferior blu-ray product.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this film.  It has adventure, romance, intrigue, amazing scenery and the very best of all, Hugh Jackman.  For a good old time rousing adventure this film can't be beat.
0786939532|5.0|I am 42.  I guess it makes me strange, but I prefer fantasy books over regular boring news programs.  Don't get me wrong, I don't live in my own little world, but... Anyway, I find R.a. Salvodre to be a great author (with a hard to spell name).  Without realizing it you find yourself comparing the other authors you read to him, and you find that they come up short.  Yes, the D&D influences are seen throughout the book and I like them.  The only thing you rarely see is what he accoplishes sort-of with these books; the magic users don't simply will a spell to work, they have to put components together and that takes time.  R.A. includes that in the story and that is what it needs to be more complete.  In short I think this is a great book.
B0012GMUIG|5.0|Don't get my review title as disrespect. This is a really good album, full of oldies from shows that Billy Joel wanted out instead of releasing his hits of the day. My favorite performance on it is \\"Captain Jack\\" which to me blows the original version away. It kinds of reminds me of The Wings live version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" on Wings over America blowing away the original studio version of that track. There are a lot of tracks to enjoy here; She's Got A Way to The Ballad Of Billy The Kid! So if you enjoy listening to early Joel \\"Live\\", spend a few dollars and get this one!<br /><br />Check my website out music fans Google \\"Judemac Forever\\"
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This CD is yet another great one. I love ALL of the songs. He has such a talent. I love all of his music.
B001FB55MG|4.0|Bedtime Stories is the family-friendly Adam Sandler coming out to play.<br /><br />Low on inappropriate language though there are plenty of slang terms, heavy on quirky characters, Sandler plays the goofy anti-hero who is just looking for his special place in the world. His friends help him along. There are fewer sexual innuendos than in previous Sander flicks. However, there are quite a few cleavage shots. Overall, Bedtime Stories is closer in feel to Mr. Deeds than Happy Gilmore,Wedding Singer or 50 First Dates.<br /><br />Why I liked it? Sandler is amusing with his sarcastic delivery and pent-up energy. The characters he plays are little boys in a man's body and that's always entertaining in my book. The movies he produces are sweet on several levels. Pro-family, not necessarily the mom, pop and 1.5 kids family, but the made up pack-type of families that tend to form on our American landscape. I love that Sandler's characters are overcomers. Regardless of the rottenness of life, they tend to struggle with the idea of change but eventually grab hold of a challenge and become better people. Sander's characters, in all the movies I've seen, are quirkily real and sometimes annoyingly sweet. The good guys have warts and the bad guys, well, they have way more warts and bad attitudes, too.  Bedtime Stories contains all of these elements.<br /><br />What I find annoying? The Little People aka dwarves always seem thrown in for simple laugh fodder.<br /><br />This is fun entertainment and classic Sandler. If you love his stuff, or family movies, you'll want to check it out.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I have read that the June 2nd release date IS for the Complete Edition. Just a little FYI.
B001EO748M|5.0|Love \\"The Tudors\\" series.  Well cast, well acted. Love the actors, costumes, sets, scenes and of course the horses, very authentic looking. I particularly enjoy the festive scenes and the dancing. They have done a superb job in the research of that era.  Makes me feel like I'm right there in that time.  Anxiously waiting for the 3rd season to come up for sale.  Karen
B000NJRL8W|5.0|possibly  the most haunting album ever recorded. music  and lyrics are beautiful, every song a masterpiece.  recomended 1st side  ist 2 songs- Procession & story in your eyes. good album for a rainy sunday afternoon, with a glass of wine.
B000050FEN|5.0|This is one of those films were you have to think. The violence is not there but you can imagine it.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Okay, so this is really only a 3.5 star movie, but still...  In any case, it's twice the movie \\"Temple of Doom\\" was, but nobody seems to notice.  Or maybe they don't want to admit that they just don't know how to enjoy mindless fun anymore.  I mean, after all, you got great action sequences, fantastic sets, good acting, great directing, music, on and on.  So it's got some sappy unrealistic romance in it - somehow everybody who expected our ears not to retreat into our skulls when we heard the fingernail-chalkboard dialog of \\"Juno\\" because \\"movies aren't real life\\" is now shouting to the film gods that somebody got mainstream pablum in their intellectual action flick.  And of course, magic boxes, cups, and stones are fine and fun but work in aliens???  OMG - it's the R word.  Just because the whole flying saucer motif fits perfectly with the time period and the time period fits perfectly with the actors' ages is no reason not to decry it.  But wait - there was some unrealistic refrigerator thing.  Seriously?  You think that sitting through 2+ hours of Kate Capshaw screaming and hamming it up makes for a better movie than one humorous sight gag?  I'll take the fridge any day over the not-quite-Bond boat chase of \\"Last Crusade\\".  I mean, if only he'd jumped out of a plane in an inflatable raft - THAT I could believe.  But aliens and refrigerators?    The truth is people wanted to hate this movie before they even saw it.  Their memories of the previous 2 Indy movies were unrealistically tinged with an undeserving glow.  They hate Lucas for not making the Star Wars movies they wanted.  So they couldn't wait to take a juicy bite out of this flick before switching theaters to whatever Ebert told them was good that week then rushing off to dinner parties where they could squawk, \\"Oh we saw the new Raiders movie and it was sooooo baaaad, but then we saw Sad Indians Get Rich and it was sooooo gooood!\\"  Squawk squawk squawk.    What would have made the movie good is if Indy had become embittered and crusty and instead of Shia they had had Jennifer Lopez as his daughter who wanted to box but he didn't train girls (and they could use that very line \\"I don't train girls\\") but then he becomes all less crusty and bitter thanks to her determination and wins like some championship or some stuff while giving away her baby so she can rock like 1977 Punk Volume One before watching Suspiria and debating its greatness with her friend who is actually only an illusion caused by her debilitating psychosis but just when she realizes the truth her homophobic gun crazy wife beating neighbor shoots her in the head which doesn't prevent her giving some sort of lofty monologue that really Makes You Think (TM).  But no refrigerators or aliens.

B001NEK2GE|2.0|I picked up the G13 a month ago and have been struggling with it since. Having used the Wolfking gamepad and other similar gamepads before, I thought this would be a nice upgrade.  The software is utterly confusing.  As the Logitech profiles are complete garbage and the key mappings illogical, I painstakingly spent time customizing several game profiles only to have them inexplicably erased from the software several reboots later. Moreover, even the default profiles often will dissappear and \\"unassigned\\" will be designated for games.  I've put a great deal of time now into trying to use this device (I really wanted to use this) and have had nothing but frustration. I would use it as a coaster, but it won't even work for that.      The saving graces of this device: ergonomic (feels nice in your hand), looks nice and the Associated Press RSS with quick IE access is really useful.    This device would be amazing if someone would come up for a profile with a set of modeling macros for Excel.
1401923119|5.0|Before I read \\"The Biology of Belief\\" I found myself going through tremendous life changes as a mother and ex-wife re-entering the work force as a counselor and healer. As I was contemplating what I was going through, and the obstacles that I needed to overcome, my mind kept going back to the story of David Helfgott, a prodigy pianist who went insane because his upbringing was filled with fear that did not support him pursuing his art. I also thought about Tiger Woods, whose life was a perfect constellation of success.  And then, as synchronicity would have it, Dr. Lipton wrote about both of these people in his book!  What are the odds for that? It gave me great hope that I could overcome my 'foster child' upbringing and pursue my work successfully with the understanding that even with intense negative programming, our cells do respond to our higher thoughts, support us in our endeavors, and even though life can start out with many strikes against us, we can persevere.  My life, heart and work are testimony to that and Dr. Lipton's book has been a great healing force for me, along with the works of many others including Lynn McTaggert[[ASIN:0743276965 The Intention Experiment: Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the World]]and Gregg Braden [[ASIN:1401905730 The Divine Matrix: Bridging Time, Space, Miracles, and Belief]] Enjoy it all!
B000VLE3IS|4.0|It's as simple as this-The sound quality is about as good as it has ever been for zeppelin (which is a huge plus) but with both discs clocking in around 65 min. there are 3 definitive Led Zeppelin classics that are nowhere to be found.If they only would have included \\"The Ocean\\", \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", and \\"Going To California\\" then this collection would feel complete and be deserving of the 5-star rating...but as is it just feels incomplete.
B00000729S|1.0|I adore the Monks, and in fact, bought this CD years ago before I knew that the Monks received NOTHING from sales of this disc. It is basically a disc that pirated their music and it is being sold for profit without their permission.
1843106698|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I've read a lot of books and articles over the last 5 years. Tony Atwood's respect and understanding comes through as he writes clearly and easily about a complex subject. Strengths and contributions from people with AS are highlighted. I was surprised when he described our son's language difficulties very closely, no one else has, and makes the point that language differences should be included in the DSM-IV which is often misleading on that score. Having so much info gathered into one source by a recognized authority made it easy to refer to certain points during our son's IEP planning meeting and at least one of his teachers was very happy to borrow it, others already owned it. I especially liked the insightful quotes from individuals with Asperger's in each chapter. I wish even more had been included.

B0015AARJI|5.0|[[ASIN:B0015AARJI PlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller]]    Product is as described on site. I enjoyed the Dualshock 2 controllers on the PS2 and I greatly enjoy the new Dualshock 3 controllers. Awesome having the wireless capability that is compatible with PS2 games as well. A charge lasts relatively long (about 5 days playing a lot). For some reason to me, the Dualshock 3 controllers feel cheaper in quality because they are matted. The Dualshock 2 controllers had a glossy finish to it and it felt sturdier. This is just me being very picky. Overall, great product, the only true controller for the PS3. Hope they don't change the signature controller.

0316017922|4.0|\\"Outliers\\" is yet another interesting book from Malcolm Gladwell. It is heartening to see someone in the \\"popular press\\" finally talk more in-depth about the influence of culture on society. This is not rocket science. We all have received our values from our parents who received them from their parents and so on. Our values affect our beliefs which in turn influence our decisions.    Gladwell mentions both the germinal works of Hofstede and Terman, two academics whose work still are valid in this era of globalization.    Gladwell is not really saying anything new. He is simply giving it a new name (\\"outliers\\") which people can readily remember. This can be akin then to Friedman's mantra, \\"The world is flat.\\"     Common sense seems to be the rage in times of crisis. Why do people pay attention to something at a time when they cannot pay for things that they want? Their time is better spent heeding common sense which they need, and which is free.    = Dr. E.S.

B000FGGE68|2.0|Now, I had not heard particularly favorable things about Ultraviolet, but I didn't care; I can appreciate B (and lower) movies just fine. I'm also a huge fan of Milla Jovovich, and writer/director Kurt Wimmer's previous film, Equilibrium.<br /><br />My main problem with the movie is the story. Now maybe it was Sony's editing that is the cause of the problems, or maybe it just didn't translate well to the screen, but it is *all* over the place. I don't have an issue with gaps in logic and/or common sense in a story, if the wording is chosen right and things are glossed over. But here, no attempt is even made to cover the incredible leaps of logical thinking required to take the story seriously. Which is what the story is played as, as opposed to tongue-in-cheek or something. I won't go into detail here, but if you're like me, you'll be banging your head against the wall. That could help put you into a daze to better appreciate the movie's real draw, which is the action.<br /><br />The action and fight scenes are very well done. There's a moment here or there which could have been easily improved with the proper editing (the flaming sword fight at the end comes to mind), but overall, they're good. This was the much anticipated (in some circles) second appearance of Gun Kata, which first made itself known in Equilibrium. Though you can see the same ideas and principles behind some of the movements at times, its appearance here is unfortunately lacking. The filmmakers would rather wave a hand and say \\"It's super-science,\\" or \\"It's magic,\\" by way of an explanation here. Quite unlike Equilibrium. Be that as it may, the action is still good.<br /><br />Honestly, if Milla Jovovich wasn't in this movie, I doubt I'd be interested in it after viewing it once. But with Milla, I'll hold unto it, putting it next to my other comic movies.<br /><br />I'd give this movie a 2, maybe 2 1/2 stars, and suggest it only to fans of Milla or Kurt Wimmer, and even then, waiting until you find it for under a dollar, used.d.

B001N18HO6|5.0|You've probably already read the other reviews, so I'll keep this one short: if you just want to hear the Brendan O'Brien remixes of Ten, by all means, buy the cheaper version and continue on with no loss of face or disrespect. If, on the other hand, you and your wife met in college because you sent her a get-well e-mail that contained references to many of the band's early songs (\\"Glad you're still 'Alive' and hope you feel 'Yellow Ledbetter' soon\\"), you're probably the Pearl Jam nerd this package was intended for.    The inclusion of the Mookie Blaylock card was a fun inside reference, and I loved the faux-whiteout used on the label on the front of the Momma-Son cassette...if my own high school band's 4-track tapes sounded that good, even in their lo-fi gravel-tone, maybe my rock-star dreams would have come true.    Vinyl in all its primitive analog-ness is antithetical to someone who makes his living from contemporary digital technology, but the inclusion of some LPs in this package at least sent me to my dad's closet for one of his old turntables. My own theory: the instinct that leads many producers to up the level on CD recordings is the real culprit (Hi, Metallica!)...it's harder to do that on vinyl, so you get a more nuanced audio spectrum that your sound system can make sense of, without clipping. I'm no audiophile, but if nothing else, it feels nice to hold that big black circle in your hands.    I have no qualms sending my money off to the folks who worked hard to put this together, and the grunge-era survivors who are Pearl Jam. But, honestly, if you don't already have your copy, you might be better off getting one of the more stripped-down versions instead. Or, spend your money and time grabbing some of their back catalog, and set aside a few twenties for a ticket the next time they're on tour.
0714834491|5.0|It seems to be consensus opinion that you cannot READ \\"Sideways.\\" So what on earth can you DO with it?  The answer is: just about anything. The very least that Alan Fletcher's book will do is add sparkle to your dinner conversations.  It can even stimulate new and innovative thinking in your business - as it has for me and my husband.      In our household, this book has taken on a persona all of its own.  Like the Family Bible of yore, \\"Sideways\\" reposes on the sideboard in our dining room, open every day at a randomly selected page.  We have included a large magnifying glass.  Yes, it's necessary at times for anyone with less than 20/20 vision. (Okay, FAR less.) What is more, \\"Sideways\\" must be perused - well, naturally - sideways.  Even upside down at times.  (Headstands optional.) For those who complained of reading difficulties, I suspect that Alan Fletcher deliberately provided these \\"hindrances\\" to force us to stop and THINK.  Otherwise we would treat his two-page spreads like billboards that we glance at casually as we speed past.      When anyone in our household passes Alan Fletcher's book there's a sudden, silence. This has prompted me to make the sideboard our \\"shrine\\" to creativity. I now see \\"Spaces for Silence\\" by Alen MacWeeney and Caro Ness in a completely different way. [[ASIN:0804834628 Spaces for Silence]] We have added a table easel to our tableau to hold a mini-corkboard to which \\"sideways\\" ideas can be added at any time they occur.  Our ideas can be expressed as puns, quotes, slogans (the latest being \\"Campaign for Curiosity!\\") as well as questions, and even our own, tongue-in-cheek cartoon attempts.     To the cynics (aka the 1 star reviewers) have you ever flown a kite without taking a child as an excuse; have you danced in the rain; licked your plate; worn a balloon hat in public; eaten candy floss after middle age; had a conversation entirely in puns; written a limerick; drawn with your eyes shut; read Dr Seuss after \\"growing up?\\"  In other words, have you ever set aside your conventional script?  If you haven't, maybe you need to cut your teeth on Keri Smith's book: \\"Destroy this Journal.\\"  (Even literally, as you will see.)  [[ASIN:039953346X Wreck This Journal]] Amazonians have responded creatively to that book, as shown by all the images displayed.   Of course, you have the benefit - or should I say \\"safety\\" - of Keri's telling you exactly what to do.  With \\"Sideways,\\" Alan Fletcher expects you to improvise, generating your own ideas by using creative initiative.  His book is simply the catalyst.

0375842209|5.0|I finished reading The Book Thief about a week ago. I miss its characters, and even shed a tear for several of them throughout the book. This novel was one of the best I have ever read, and I am a voracious reader.   I teach middle school literature, and in the next few weeks, one of my 8th grade gifted reading classes will begin reading The Book Thief. I am so excited to share this with them.   This is not a novel however that I think is an easy read. The unique narrator, the foreshadowing, and the figurative language make it a heavy read. I found myself occasionally turning back to clarify my own comprehension. I would recommend this book for adult readers who love historical fiction and for advanced adolescent readers.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is a tax man.  As a matter of fact, he's the kind of serious tax man that the Beatles sang about:<br />\\"Now my advice for those who die, (Taxman!)<br />Declare the pennies on your eyes, (Taxman!)<br />`Cos I'm the Taxman.\\"<br />2. Crick begins hearing a female voice in his head narrating his life, and starts to take it really seriously when she starts talking about impending doom.<br />3. You've heard that the two inevitable things are death and taxes<br />4. You may be half right<br /><br />Will Ferrell is really good in this role as an ill-fated character, and gets good support from Maggie Gyllenhaal as a sassy baker, Dustin Hoffman as a literature professor and Emma Thompson as a famous writer.  Queen Latifah is mostly under-utilized, but makes the most of her limited screen time anyway.<br /><br />Recommended as a Sunday rental to go with muffins and cookies - milk optional.<br /><br />Harold Crick: \\"This may sound like gibberish to you, but I think I'm in a tragedy.\\"<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 4, 2009
B000WQWPKA|3.0|I gave this only 3 stars because it is not the longer special edition, but only the theatrical version.  The blu ray is terrific, though, in both video and sound quality. There were many scenes that I did not recognize due to the greater detail provided by BD. However, had I realized it was not the SE version, I would have waited. I would suggest saving your $$ for the longer version we all know will be released some day.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|Although Al Stewart issued many fine albums both before and after Year of the Cat and indeed is still recording good music today, most will recognize this record as the apex of his commercial success. So large does it loom in the musical history of my generation that many casual music fans would mistakenly name this as his first album.  This is my fourth copy of this album. I have the LP, went through two cassettes, and now I bought it on CD because it is both inexpensive and more importantly, remastered. Year of the Cat just never sounds stale, it has something for everyone. Whether you prefer Stewart's historical and mystical allusions, enjoy a little romance and mystery, or maybe simply enjoy the whimsy that's inherent throughout, they are all here. This album never fails to please!  I like every song, but my favorites are: the imaginative If It Doesn't Come Naturally, Leave It; the elusive and allegorical Flying Sorcery; the enigmatic romance of Broadway Hotel; the mystical One Stage Before; and of course the breezy and whimsical title cut.  The remastered CD is accompanied by an attractive insert containing all pertinent album info including the lyrics, commentary, and a couple of pictures. Year of the Cat is one of those proverbial \\"desert island discs\\" that will still sound great a hundred years hence. If you don't have this remaster, get it soon. You'll be delighted all over again.
B001GKYBXA|3.0|this was quite a suprise when i first heard about this cd.a musical project in a sort of group vein involving paul mccartny and someone called youth.this is suppose to be electronic music but instead of being so out there that it misses the main stream totally, pauls involvment brings the music into the pop/rock arena very nicely.at the same time because this is not a solo cd ala mccartny,the music is supriseingly different and supriseingly good.again,you can here pauls heavy influences thruout the cd but for those of us hopeing to hear the ex-beatle do something that is fresh,new and experamental like what was done way back in time in the studio by the fab four,this is it, or as close to it as we will ever get.me personally i find myself replaying this cd often and i find it much better than most new pop/rock out there right now.

141690977X|5.0|This book will tell you like it is... from a guy's perspective.  My eyes were opened, and not because I think men are easier to understand now, but because I realized that I am worth more than waiting around.  I bought this book to re-read when I lose sight of that fact.  A must read for single ladies and attached women alike!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|\\"Only By the Night\\" is a real breakthrough for a band that was already great. I'm not going to write a song-by-song review like a lot of other people do, but one thing I will say is that a lot of the best songs on this album are not the songs you've heard on the radio. While \\"Crawl\\", \\"Sex on Fire\\" and \\"Use Somebody\\" are all great tracks, two of my favorites will probably never come out as singles: \\"Be Somebody\\" and \\"Frontier City\\" (bonus track). I like what one other reviewer said about this music having so much atmosphere. There's just something about this band -- nobody really sounds like they do. I never get tired of listening to them, and there seems to be a song that fits whatever mood I am in. There are plenty of good tracks to choose from on this album.   It's sad that a lot of less talented artists get all the attention from the music press in the U.S. while a great band like KOL has to go to the UK to be successful. It's weird to think that one of the best bands in America is hardly known in its home country. If you're not familiar with Kings of Leon, this is a good album to get started.
1400082773|4.0|The book offers a candid personal history and commentary by first non-white President on the subject of race.  I say \\"non-white\\" instead of \\"black\\" because this book provides an explanation of the racial and family background of Barack Obama.       The first part of the book deals with the roots of his mother's family, who for all intents and purposes, raised him.  The last part of the book provides an account of his trip to Kenya to visit his father's grave and meet the half siblings that share his name.  The Kenya trip and his thoughts upon his visit were by far the most interesting as it offers his thoughts into challenges that are common to any human being, regardless of race, nationality or origin.  This portion could have been developed into a separate book.      The reason for rating of 4 starts instead of 5 is that the middle portion of the book provides a very, very (almost excruciatingly) detailed account of this work in Chicago as a community organizer.  This period of his live is after his graduation from undergrad, but immediately prior to the time he heads off to Harvard Law School. My guess is that the middle section is where the author thought he had the most to offer in terms of commentary on the status of racial relations in America; namely, the issues of an urban social and economic divide.     Notwithstanding the issue with the middle portion, this book is well written and interesting.  Most importantly, it has saved for posterity the candid thoughts of a young, up and coming Barack \\"Barry\\" Obama.
B001P3SA94|4.0|[[ASIN:B001P3SA94 Cadillac Records]] is a very good movie that brings to life the early years of Chess Records, the Blues and Rock and Roll.  It takes some artistic license with music history.  But it succeeds in creating a compelling story that introduces younger audiences to the lives of music legends like Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Howlin' Wolf, Willie Dixon, Chuck Berry and Etta James.  Movies based on real events are always a challenge.  Problems with timeline  continuity may irk those who are already well educated on the music.  Yet writer / director Darnell Martin deserves praise for all of the accurate history that this movie succeeds in squeezing into two hours.<br /><br />For those wondering if they should see this movie, my answer is an unequivocal \\"yes.\\"  Those who are interested in the special features and more details on the history, please read on.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />The story of Chess Records hinges on the relationship between two key characters, Len Chess, played by Adrien Brody, and Muddy Waters, played expertly by Jeffrey Wright.  When Chess decides to record Waters, the history of music is forever changed and Chess Records is put on the map.<br /><br />Columbus Short is great as Little Walter, the volatile harmonica player and Blues singer who, at the young age of 17, started playing with Muddy Waters.  Even at that age, he was already a master of his instrument having been a street performer before his teens.  He first appears on Muddy's recordings but eventually becomes a hit recording artist for Chess Records on his own.<br /><br />Eamonn Walker also puts in a great performance as legendary blues singer Howlin' Wolf.  He clashes with Muddy over women and band members.  We also get to see the record label grow into a major force with artists who cross-over to mainstream radio, such as Chuck Berry, played by Mos Def, and Etta James, played by Beyonce Knowles.  Mos Def puts in a good performance as Berry, but Beyonce really shows her tremendous growth as an actress.<br /><br />The legendary song-writer Willie Dixon is played by Cedric The Entertainer, who is mainly the narrator and has limited screen time.  Even as a fan of Cedric the Entertainer, I think it was a stretch to cast him as Willie Dixon.  He is simply too old to portray a young Dixon during the 50s, and I found his accent distracting.<br /><br />The success of Chess Records is bitter sweet, as some of its artists succumb to their demons and over time more of their music is copied by other artists.  Still, we get a clear picture of the tremendous influence that early Blues musicians had on Rock and Roll.<br /><br />THE MUSIC<br /><br />Musical tastes vary, and to many people no re-creation of any blues classic could ever live up to the original.  Yet I really think that the music of this movie is very well done, considering that not all of the actors had formal training and they produced this film with limited time and money.  Steve Jordon produced the music for the movie, directing the actors on their singing and arranging for professional musicians to re-record the arrangements.<br /><br />In addition, Terrence Blanchard lent his accomplished hand to the score of the movie.  While the score mostly blends into the background, that is a sign of how well made it is.  The music is a central character in this movie and they made the right choices here by employing two incredible musical minds.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />There is a standard production feature included that has interviews excerpts from the director and cast members.  There are some valuable insights into the technical aspects of the production, including sets, wardrobe and makeup.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes: There are some interesting deleted scenes included here.  In one, Len introduces Phil Chess to Muddy.  Many think Phil's character wasn't in the movie at all because this scene was cut.  Played by Shiloh Fernandez, Phil actually does still have some other scenes in the movie: one where he introduces Etta to Len and a few others in the recording studio.  But while Phil at least has face time, the Great Bo Diddly is unfortunately not in the movie.  There were just too many characters to cast, it seems.  Other deleted scenes include one of Len and his wife, played by Emmanuelle Chriqui, an alternate take of the scene where Howlin' Wolf threatens Muddy, and two different versions of a scene where musicians are locked out of Chess studios.<br /><br />DIRECTOR COMMENTARY: While I religiously watch special features, I rarely enjoy the director's commentary as much as I did with this movie.  Director Darnell Martin communicates just how tight the budget was, including:<br />**  The scene where Len Chess pays Vincent Dinofrio, a radio DJ in the movie, to play Muddy Waters record was shot on a set that had been built that day while the paint was still wet!<br />**  Because they couldn't budget for wigs for the actors who played the Rolling Stones, several were cast for hair alone.<br />**  Perhaps most incredibly, many of Columbus Short's scenes were filmed in one take.  The company that insured the film put strict limits to avoid any cost overruns due to filming delays.<br /><br />THE HISTORY (*** SPOILERS ***)<br /><br />The director admits in the commentary that there was no evidence of any of the intimacy between Len and Etta that is portrayed in the movie.  She stands by the story that Chess did ensure that Etta was returned the deed to her home upon his death.  She also seems to play on the fact that Len resisted Etta's affections because of race.  One other interesting fact: she reiterates it was likely that Minnesota Fats was Etta's father.<br /><br />The conflict that arose between Wolf and Muddy over guitarist Hubert Sumlin was indeed based upon real events.  Muddy did take Hubert for his own band, and Wolf did threaten Muddy over it.  Hubert Sumlin was an extra in the movie and vouched for the scene where Wolf stands up to Len.<br /><br />Also of note is the story that Little Walter killed his impersonator, which according to the commentary was based on Sonny Boy Williamson's account.  Sonny played with Walter and knew him well.<br /><br />CONTINUITY PROBLEMS<br /><br />There are several issues with chronology in the movie.  Some changes add drama to the story.  Yet even giving the director the creative benefit of the doubt, it is very difficult to tell what year it is as the movie wears on.  Some facts seem to suggest it's 1957, then people from 1964 show up and suddenly we are back in 1960.  While the significant timeline errors don't make this a less enjoyable movie, they do ensure that anybody who studies the history of this music will either be incredibly annoyed by the inconsistencies or feel the need to study the movie to find them all.<br /><br />It seems strange that Chuck Berry discusses the Beach Boy's copying his hit \\"Sweet Little Sixteen\\" before he is arrested.  It's a significant continuity issue since he eventually served 5 years under that conviction, and in the movie there is barely a mention of the time that elapses before he re-appears.<br /><br />There are similar chronological changes made to introduce Muddy Waters and the Rolling Stones.  The Rolling Stones did actually record at Chess Studios during their 1964 US tour, though I am not sure if they met during that original recording session.  The Stones didn't yet have a hit in the US.  Muddy toured in the UK and Europe in the late 50s, but here they imply the Stones set up his first UK tour in the late 60s. It also seems strange that introduce them before Elivs Prestley.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />No flaw takes anything away from the great performances by the cast, the very good direction by Darnell Martin and the wonderful music that has been recreated so well for this movie.  I definitely recommend this film to all fans of music history.  And if you are a Blues fan, I would guess you likely have already seen the movie.  Don't let a critical eye prevent you from enjoying this movie for what it is.  This is a film that is well designed to introduce the music of the Blues and early Rock and Roll to a wider audience than ever before.  And that is something that I definitely think deserves praise.<br /><br />Enjoy.on Sonny Boy Williamson's account.  Sonny played with Walter and knew him well.

0060723513|5.0|In 1999, this book started my path into the world of Metaphysics!  What a wonderful journey it has been.  My most recent purchase was as a gift for a friend who also is beginning her journey and she has since passed it on to others. Not that this would be the beginning for everyone but it does \\"stir the pot\\" so to speak---and allows for the break from convention.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Arrived on time and was in perfect condition. Love this show! It is rich, dramatic, and well-acted. I can't wait to see what happens next in each eposide. A little cheeky in terms of the historical references, but overall a great show. Highly recommend.
0380715430|3.0|Bryson celebrates the mobility, diversity and endurance of the English language, and pretty well pours scorn on those over the years who have sought to regulate, direct, codify, analyse, latinise or otherwise control the thing that more people speak as a second language than as a 'mother tongue'.<br /><br />The book is well written and gives quite a good number of laughs and original observations. Bryson is not strong on languages other than English and makes quite a few blunders, including his hilarious misunderstanding of the Japanese writing system.<br /><br />Like most who have studied English, he is in awe of Shakespeare, and goes to some length to explain why. The book is pretty evenly balanced between UK and American english, but has only half a page on Aussie usage and no recognition of the Noi Zoiland contribution to the great lexicography. Sorry bros, sweet enough but not sweet as.

0670020478|1.0|This is such a silly book. Worse, its therapies are misguided.    The author rails against traditional education that emphasizes reading, writing, and math. He also dislikes the standardized tests that students across the country must take.    How misguided!  To get a good job, one that is interesting and fulfulling, you must gain foundational skills in these three areas. It is absolutely imperative for most students.  There are a few exceptions, but how many people have the superb native talent of a Mozart or an Einstein?     Once you have these foundational skills, you build upon them in the field of study you enjoy. Then you can go anywhere, do anything. And probably get well paid for it. At least in America. But getting those foundational skills in the first place requires often boring routine study and some rote learning. That is a hard truth that many modern educators rebel against. But there doesn't seem to be any shortcut around it.     There is so much to disagree with in this book. For example, the author says once you are cast as a certain type in a corporation, you are stuck with that role. I disagree entirely.  The author is British, and maybe that is true of corporations in the UK. But not in the USA. I have worked many years for several American corporations, both big and small, and almost without exception, they are open to advancement by their employees. They consider it win-win -- the corporation wins and the employee wins.     For example, if you are a 'science' type or a 'financial' type who wants to strike out into new territory, let's say into advertising or sales, many corporations will welcome you. Here's why: So few people in their advertising department have a clue about science, logic, and numbers, they welcome your background and expertise. In fact, you can often write your own ticket in such situations. You already know what the science side of the house is thinking, ie, their mentality and their approach to problem-solving. That can bevery valuable in the right circles.     But the point is you need (at least) a foundational education in reading, writing, and math. You can't get around it. When you have that foundation, the sky's the limit -- you can pursue virtually any career, you can go wherever you like. Without that foundation, you will likely flounder around for the rest of your life, possibly become a burden to your family and to society -- unless you are very exceptional.    The author points to several exceptional talents, eg Paul McCartney, whose undiscovered talent was overlooked by his school system. McCartney is indeed an exceptional talent, and whose talent eventually shone through, as has the talent of countless songwriters in the past.  Did Harold Arlen or Richard Rodgers, the creators of melodies at least as beautiful as any of McCartney's, go to special schools or follow a special curriculum?  Of course not. Is McCartney representative of most students, even a few students? Hardly. I suspect that the majority of students put into special programs, thinking they're the next Paul McCartney, would end up being very disappointed. Worse, they may end up being a derelict with skills that are valued by nobody.      You only have a few precious years to learn foundational skills. Let's not waste them by following pie-in-the sky, unproven, and dangerous theories like this author's.
B001KW0C96|3.0|I watched with anticipation for the scenes between these 2 iconic actors yet in the end I was disappointed. Why?  The revelation of the serial killer was just not plausible and even the performances of DeNiro and Pacino cannot cover this hole.  Also why is Jon Avnet the director of this flick when he just made Pacino's horrible \\"88 Minutes\\", probably the worst movie Al has made since \\"Revolution\\"?  I still have hopes for these two brilliant actors since I've enjoyed their work in \\"Donnie Brasco\\", \\"Goodfellows\\", \\"Heat\\", \\"Scent of a Woman\\", etc. You'd be better off watching a re-run of \\"NYPD Blue\\" or \\"Law & Order\\".  Also the fine supporting cast is pretty much wasted here (Brian Dennehy, John Leguziamo, lovely Carla Gugino and Donnie Wahlburg).  Better luck next time fellows---I give this film just 3 or 2.5 for the duo!!
B000001DYA|5.0|When I first heard Blue Cheer's cover of Eddie Cochran's classic \\"Summertime Blues,\\" on FM radio way back in 1968 I was blown away as you can imagine! It is without a doubt the most awesome version by anybody, although some would argue that The Who's \\"live\\" version from \\"Live At Leeds\\" is the best, and it is definitely right up there, but I've always liked Blue Cheer's version better than anybody's! Even after 40 + years it still amazes me when I listen to it, and Vincebus Eruptum should be heard and owned by anyone who loves really hard or heavy metal rock, and these guys were THE FIRST band really to be considered heavy metal, well before Sabbath, Zeppelin, Deep Purple etc. You can't go wrong with this, and I agree with other reviewers that they didn't get the recognition they deserved! Many of the members were in various groups before Blue Cheer, and they were: The Other Half, Oxford Circle, Sons Of Adam, and Kak to name a few. All of those are great albums and if you can find the CD's, get them because they're all excellent! Glenn Signal Hill, CA
0061537934|5.0|The author's ability to tell this story from the perspective of an incredibly loving and devoted dog is truly a gift. I was hesitant because I am not a racing fan - do not worry. Our book club loved this book - highly recommend it to all. And it's not just about DOGS - it's life, family, death, tragedy, triumph, and most of all, the power of unconditional love.
0812550757|3.0|Ender's Game (1985) is one of the all-time best SF books. It deservedly won the Hugo and Nebula awards.  It's routinely read in schools and is a genuine classic.  It's also a crowd pleaser- a book that nearly everyone likes.    Speaker for the Dead (1987) is the direct sequel and also won the same awards.  However, in tone and plot, it's a VERY different book.  For the right reader, who likes thoughtful, slow-paced stories about culture and alien/human interaction (think Ursula LeGuin), this book is a gem.  For everyone else, this book will be a huge disappointment.  If you fall into the latter category, and haven't read Ender's Game yet, then don't let this (or Card's other work) discourage you at all from checking out Ender's Game.    Which book is \\"better\\" is definitely debatable- but there's ZERO doubt that Ender's Game is the far more popular work.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time.  I saw Pantera 9 times in concert and missed my 10th because of the flu.  If I would have know Dimebag would be killed a few years later, I would have went to more!
B001R4MEYI|5.0|You know the one, head back, tongue hanging out, a bit of ecstatic drool trickling down the chin...that's me right now.<br />Crack the Skye is in every way as strong and satisfying as Blood Mountain, though it does have its differances.<br />The most notable are the clean vocals, which may turn off some fans, but I think they fit the material perfectly.  That material has all the Sabbathy doom, gut-punch Southern attitude, and angular progressiveness of its predecessor, but adds an ethereal, spaced-out quality that would make Hawkwind proud.<br /> With Crack The Skye Mastadon has cemented its place at the forefront of modern metal and has left many seasoned veterans in the dust.  This album is a must for any fan of the genre and highly recommendable to anyone who is even a  casual metal fan or anyone who just appreciates well crafted musicianship.<br />In short--buy it!  Buy it now!! Play it until you're floating on the ceiling staring down at your body.
0316010669|3.0|This book started with a bang and got me hooked. It is a very interesting premise and the accounts that Gladwell started with were relevant and powerful in illustrating his thesis. Halfway through the book, the different stories Gladwell included become less and less pertinent to his central thesis. The point becomes really diffuse in the second half of the book and he almost lost my interest. One of the stars in my rating is from the fact that it is a decent effort and an interesting premise, but could be executed better to maintain readers' interest.

B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith Urban's new CD \\"Defying Gravity\\" is a uplifting breath of fresh air in these uncertain times. Filled with upbeat, uptempo songs that express his contented place in life, the songs will put a smile on your face and a beat in your step. He returns to his country roots with more banjo, fiddle and mandolin while also throwing in a dash of an 80's feeling in several of the songs. Love is the central theme whether it be hoping for it (Kiss a Girl, Sweet Thing)relishing it(Only You Could Love Me This Way, Why's It Feel So Long) and honoring it (Thank You). Buy this album, you won't be able to take it out of your CD player.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I just received this album on yesterday as a B'day gift from my Ladyfriend and I'm amazed and absolutely LOVING Quiet Nights!??! I'm a huge fan of Diana Krall & The Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra...so naturally I'm excited to see John Clayton & Jeff Hamilton in the album credits for all of the songs also a treat that's \\"SO NICE\\" to see Paulinho DaCosta's name listed under the Percussion on MANY but not ALL the songs. I've always loved his percussion styles(personally)back to stuff he did with Anita Baker in the 80's! Anthony Wilson always does his thing on Guitar. Then there's the FULL Orchestra...reminds me of the Diana Krall \\"WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES\\" & \\"LOOK OF LOVE\\" era. I LOVE Diana Krall have all the albums...this CD just completed my DK collection and of course now it's on my Microsoft ZUNE and my Blackjack2 so that \\"Quiet Nights\\" NEVER leaves my side. YEAH! This album is THAT good! I just don't have \\"Love Scenes\\" on mp3 yet...still have that on Cassette tape from my High School days!?!? *LOL* I'll still cherish that Cassette when I DO get the album via mp3 here at Amazon...no use in getting the CD since I've got the tape with all the Production Credits in it!?!?    In closing \\"QUIET NIGHTS\\" is a S'wonderful listen and the album is targeted for exactly what it's Title says....QUIET NIGHTS! The lush string arrangements, the groove of Jeff Hamilton on Drums, Anthony Wilson strumming along with the Steinway & Sons under Diana's fingertips topping that are the rich room(or CAR *LOL*)filling Bass lines from John Clayton! The type of album you can just put on and relax to OR spend a QUIET NIGHT with that somebody special! Dare I say that, Diana made a 120% \\"MOOD\\" album this time around!?!? That's NOT a very far stretch...I'm sure those fans that OWN this album like me will agree. I've always personally enjoyed DK's SWING & Bossa Nova styles...but in the past I would play \\"WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES\\" to hear those Beautiful Orchestra accompanied songs...and say MAN,I love how lovely these songs are why doesn't she bring BACK the Orchestra?? But now I have QUIET NIGHTS! Its kinda like \\"When I Look In Your Eyes: Reloaded for 2009\\" I cannot wait to catch the QUIET NIGHTS Tour in the USA! I'm sure that \\"SO NICE\\" will be magical performed Live! I always enjoy her Concerts her stage presence/performance is amazing! Oh yeah, I'll be picking up the LIVE IN RIO DVD too when released in May *wink*     If you're a fan of DK and enjoy her Bossa Nova style & Orchestra Arrangements during her \\"WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES\\" & \\"THE LOOK OF LOVE\\" era you're going to LOVE \\"QUIET NIGHTS\\" an album that's 100% or 120% (if you buy the bonus tracked album) of Bossa Nova & Orchestra Greatness! This album really is TOO MARVELOUS FOR WORDS.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|When I first heard that Judas Priest were doing a double album opus about the \\"life of Nostradamus\\" all I could do was laugh. It was among the most \\"Spinal Tap\\" move they could make at this point in their career, and even though their last album \\"Angel of Retribution\\" was not terrible, I thought this would be a misfire that they could not recover from for awhile. I read the initial reviews and thought \\"this is probably correct\\", heard the album a few times, put it away, and basically when the topic was brought up in conversation it was usually in mocking terms.<br /><br />But a funny thing happened. I got in the mood to hear it again. I liked the initial riffs from the album (Prophecy) and got in the mood to hear that song. It is catchy. Keep in mind this is over six months after I had bought the album. I thought it was down there with Point of Entry or Turbo. I thought a few songs were ok, but for the most part it was among the worst they had done (with Halford at least).<br /><br />I then pulled it out, and for the first time, listened to all the songs back to back.<br /><br />I was enthralled. It really hit me. My room was lit with candles that night coincidentally (so it gave it special meaning), and it was really late at night and I started to really dig the album. All of a sudden the seemingly disparate parts and long winded musical passages became a whole. It actually seemed to be a shorter album than I remembered, and all the hooks were fully piercing my musical experience.<br /><br />I then decided I really liked the album. I listened to it on a trip to Chicago from Madison several times, and I decided that this is likely one of their better works.<br /><br />Certainly better than Angel of Retribution, maybe better than Ram it Down and (obviously) Turbo. Up there with the Painkillers and the Stained Classes of the world for sure.<br /><br />One expectation that you can't have is that this isn't \\"80's\\" style Priest. Its epic, in the tradition of their 70's albums. However it has a lot of the production of their 80's albums, almost reminding me of a mix of Defenders of the Faith and Ram it Down. What I mean is the sound is derived from those albums, including songs like \\"Blood Red Skies\\" that pop up from time to time moodwise in songs like \\"Visions\\".<br /><br />I always thought their mid Eighties work just could have had some special touch to make it great if they wanted it to, and this album shows the full potential of that sound. There are a few parts that sound like drum machine, a lot of orchestral parts, some actual synth parts (with a dreamy feel), and I even hear an influence from slower \\"doomier\\" songs like \\"Monsters of Rock\\" from Ram it Down or \\"Loch Ness\\" from Angel of Retribution. In fact some of these doomier songs (like \\"Death\\") almost remind me of Dehumanizer/Cross Purposes era Black Sabbath in a way.<br /><br />There are a few fast songs as well in the title track and others, but this is an album that has the modern Angel of Retribution sound mixed with the mid eighties with a compositional feel that reminds me of their seventies material.<br /><br />Conceptually and lyrically, well its usual Judas Priest with the concepts of personal liberty, being an outcast, and vindication all thrown in with good measure. It doesn't really matter what the subject matter is really about, its all arbitrary compared to what they were really trying to do; its almost as if Nostradamus was an after thought to their (usual) subjects. That's ok though, and despite ultra-cheesy lyrics, Rob Halford in particular gives the performance of a lifetime. His mid ranged vocals throughout the album (with some highs) are good to hear as they are some of his strongest in a long time (and I am including his solo career too).<br /><br />The guitars could have better tone, and I've never really LOVED the solos of Tipton and Downing like I do with Smith and Murray but there are some cool \\"Turboesque\\" synth guitar effects put in there too.<br/><br />The bass isn't totally buried but it is perfunctuory as usual, the drums could be a bit more expressive but they are adequate.<br /><br />Overall, this could be the sleeper hit of their career, the musical experience is beckoning you to a time when Priest were more of an \\"album\\" band (i.e the seventies) rather than a \\"songs\\" band (the eighties and on).uld be a bit more expressive but they are adequate.

B001NE80P4|4.0|Just an FYI to above poster that stated \\"Among the main four, the only other cast member worthy of notice is Corbin Bleu whom has plenty of charisma even though I'm not yet convinced he's got any serious acting ability. But then - I've never seen him do anything outside of HSM. \\"  Corbin has done several other shows and I think he does a pretty good job acting. He did Jump In on TV and Flight 29 Down. I think that that HSM 2 was better but this was a nice ending to the other 2 movies and my preteen son loves them all!

B00005Y7KX|5.0|I came accross this DVD while searching for Disney's Hunchback. Said to myself, oh, how interesting, let's try this. Received the disc & let it sit for several days. Finally decided to play the disk... I was up until the wee hours. I watched it 3 times in a row that first night. That was 2 months ago. I've either watched the DVD or listened to the soundtrack at least once every day since. It is without question the best musical/opera I have ever seen/heard, and I love both genre. The voices, the music, the acting, the stageing, the dance all truly magnificent. Especially the voices, heavenly. What I would give to have seen this live. Thank God for the wonders of technology.

I first heard \\"Briefcase full of Blues\\" in my best friend's bedroom on an old \\"Reader's Digest\\" record player, and it literally changed my life.      John Belushi's star was on the rise.  He had a top TV show, a top movie, and the top record album in the country back in'79, a record NO ONE has beat.  Judy Pisano has done a wonderful job of showing the man behind the legend.  It's full of pictures from her private collection, showing the rise an the fall of a true comic genius.  We still miss you, John.

B001PPGAIA|1.0|I rented this movie to watch with my husband. I ended up being embarassed by my poor choice. I'm a big fan of Moulin Rouge, by the same director, but this movie was disappointing.  First the good points. The little boy is charming and a good actor. Some of the scenery is beautiful, and Hugh Jackman's character is pleasant to look at.   The bad points are numerous. The story is ridiculously melodramatic at numerous points, and since this is a long movie that gets old fast. Nicole Kidman's acting is, well, what we are coming to expect of her recently, fake lips and all. The scenes in Darwin are cartoonishly fake, with skylines that look like those painted on ceilings they have in some of the casinos in Vegas. Not believable AT ALL. The story is confusing during the Darwin section as well. All in all I would only recommend this to someone who wants to have their heartstrings  unskillfully yanked for a very long time, all the while suspending disbelief. This movie tries to be an epic, and fails epicly. If you want a movie about Australia with a little realism and genuine emotion, may I suggest \\"Man From Snowy River\\".
1404993169|4.0|One of the big arcs of the \\"Stargate SG-1\\" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis.<br /><br />It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually), known as \\"Stargate: Atlantis.\\" The first season has its duds and awkward moments -- much like its parent series -- but it proves to be a solid introduction to likable new heroes, a legendary city, and a new race of alien parasites.<br /><br />At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gives the go-ahead for an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.<br /><br />So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. Unfortunately, after ten millennia Atlantis is running out of power, and soon the whole place will flood. The military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), goes scouting for a planet to evacuate to, and encounter the friendly natives.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the irritable scientist Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) tries to somehow salvage the city -- only to have it rise from the ocean floor. But then the SG teams accidentally wake an ancient enemy -- the parasitic, vampiric Wraith, who destroyed the Ancients long ago. Cut off from Earth, the expedition settles into the Ancient city and tries to make the best of their situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- an energy-sucking \\"shadow,\\" possible spies, life-sucking bugs, a destructive nanovirus, a mysterious goddess, suicidal kids, cannibal Wraith, and an Amishlike people who turn out to be ruthless soldiers. And the Wraith are closing in on Atlantis, intent on getting to Earth -- forcing Weir and Sheppard to arm the city for what may be its final stand.<br /><br />\\"Stargate: Atlantis\\" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of \\"Stargate SG-1,\\" and two of the characters (Weir and McKay) were also recurring characters. And thank God, there is no endless whining about how they may never see Earth again, as many series would do -- the Atlantis personnel just forge ahead, and deal with it.<br /><br />It does have some flaws, mostly the same ones that \\"SG-1\\" had in ITS first season -- a few duds (\\"The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you\\"), and many others that are good sci-fi watchin', but not great. It takes a little time for the series to get comfortable, but by the last four or five episodes, it really takes off.<br /><br />And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror. But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney massaging his feet during a conference), or its human side -- for example, one episode has everyone recording touching messages to send back to Earth.<br /><br />And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges. Most are from Rodney (\\"This device must be using an older version of Windows\\"), and Sheppard (\\"I am your death. That is all you need to know.\\" \\"I prefer 'Steve'\\"). But there's humor from everyone (\\"Find another problem with it! Tell him that the power-loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout!\\").<br /><br />The cast is a bit uneven -- Higginson is given too little to do, and Rainbow Sun Francks just never works. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian sarcastic snap, Hewlett is hilarious as the mildly antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is simply adorable as a cuddly Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell starts off as just the token native love interest, she evolves nicely at the end of the season.<br /><br />\\"Stargate Atlantis\\" has its shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles. But it's a solid first for a solid sci-fi series, gating out into a new galaxy.shaky moments, and the actors were still getting a grip on their roles.

B0019IB26I|5.0|My wife has always enjoyed John Mayer's music.  Myself, I've learned to like it.  A few weeks ago, she purchased John Mayer's latest, \\"Where The Light Is.\\"  For those who don't know, \\"Where The Light Is\\" is a live concert album that was  recorded in Los Angeles in December 2007 and was released as a CD in July 2008.  The concert is divided into three sections: acoustic, electric blues, and rock.<br />Electric blues has always been a favorite of mine, so I settled into that part of the concert first.  In the past, John's guitar work has been too laid back for me, so I really wasn't expecting a strong set.  His rendition of \\"Come When I Call\\" sounded eerily familiar to that of the legendary Stevie Ray Vaughn, and then when he played a 10-minute solo on \\"Out of My Mind,\\" he almost exorcised the talent of Jimi Hendrix.  I was impressed.<br />Heading back to the acoustic section, I found that I preferred his acoustic arrangements of \\"Neon\\" and \\"Daughters\\" to that of the originals.  The acoustic guitar and John Mayer seemed to be made for each other.<br />Finally, I listened to the section with John and his band.  If you haven't seen him live in concert, this is pretty close.  If you have, you'll be able to relive the moments.  John's lead guitar work is on par with some of the best.  Overall, I enjoy this CD.  My wife has requested that I order one of my own and stop taking hers.
B000051YD6|4.0|Claudio Arrau recorded these Beethoven concerti while in his early 80's.  Having played these pieces all his life, his readings here are something of a backward, departing glance after much time spent in their company.<br /><br />This is most obvious in the 4th concerto.  Arrau plays the 1st movement a tick or two slower than he probably did earlier in his life and, certainly, slower than his contemporaries.  This choice seems initially to let the air out of the tires a bit while exposing greater beauties further on in the solo part.  The leisurely pace is not without pitfalls, however, as a slower tempo poses a greater problem for the orchestra than the piano.  The instrumental textures are quite thick and, when played too slowly, it is very easy for the orchestral part to lose its sense of line.  Colin Davis does everything he can to support Arrau's singular vision of this movement, and I'm happy to say that he succeeds for the most part.  He makes a wonderful ensemble when playing with Arrau, getting out of his way so the piano can really have its say.  Arrau avoids the temptation to be rhythmically fussy or tortured, as I've sometimes heard him do in other pieces of the same period.  Here he is lyrical and wistful, but thankfully not mawkish or sentimental.  The cadenza comes off as more reflective than virtuosic, although there are moments of genuine fire.  While I prefer more brio myself, Arrau's choice here argues convincingly for a slightly different approach.<br /><br />The 2nd and 3rd movements are more conventionally drawn and wonderfully played.  The andante is a somber dialogue, the piano pleading with a grim and resolute orchestra.  The rondo finale is sprightly and rhythmic with a great variety of touch and expression.<br /><br />The reading of the 5th concerto is highly extroverted, on the other hand.  Arrau and Davis give one of the most sincerely noble and grand renditions of a work that has become overly familiar and possibly overplayed.  For example, the 1st movement opening cadenza is often played with very little imagination and/or no color by younger players these days.  In contrast, Arrau plays it with a disarming rhythmic spontaneity and actually gives it some shape.  The big moments are as big as the piano can possibly give, Arrau squeezing out the very last milligram of sound possible from the instrument, with Davis and company matching him blow for blow.  The quiet moments are beautifully projected, and the close is exultant.  The 2nd movement is solemnly paced, with moments of great delicacy and lyricism from both parties.  The 3rd movement is buoyant, playful and highly colored, although one has the impression that Arrau is occasionally playing slightly behind the beat.<br /><br />Recording sound quality and balance are excellent.  In many ways, a superb recording.pening cadenza is often played with very little imagination and/or no color by younger players these days.

B000002952|1.0|I'm amazed at the number of people who have left comments that this rather soft, middle-of-the-road piece of American pop music is somehow Cuban music. Yes, it's sung in Spanish - and Ms. Estafan's family came from Cuba - but where's the meat? Which Cuban CD sounds anything like this stuff?<br />Having been a pop singer for many years, Gloria suddenly discovered her Cuban family roots and her parents anti-Castro-ism. I guess it would be too cynical to say if you buy into the American dream, leave your homeland and become an American then there's a musical price to pay....and this rather tepid CD is a testament to that.
B00005YW4H|4.0|In the late 1960s, sitarist Ravi Shankar took on pupil George Harrison and changed the face of music forever. It's no surprise, then, that Shankar's daughter, Norah Jones, is doing the same with her debut album \\"Come Away with Me\\". Released nearly a decade ago, the record still shines as bright as it did when it first came out.     Blues music had not really found a home on mainstream radio until 2002, when Jones released this album. The jazzy record quickly flew up the charts, thanks to her clear vocals and dazzling piano. But make no mistake; this is a simple record. Many songs feature just Jones and the piano, though a few have the more traditional drums and guitars. And the combination works.     My personal favorites from this record are no surprise; the jazzy 'Come Away with Me' is truly reminiscent of a lazy summer night with a gentle breeze and the one you love. 'One Flight Down' definitely has my favorite lyrics ('The reeds and brass have been weaving/Leading into a single note') and heralds back to a 1950s jazz club - you can almost imagine Louis Armstrong in the background. 'Shoot the Moon' is a simple tune that could be the soundtrack to a cross-country trip, while 'Turn Me On' is a sensual, piano-driven track that captures the easiness of love.    It's rare in the 21st century to have an album where you can simply listen to a great voice sing, but Norah Jones has accomplished that. Her record is truly a vocal masterpiece, full of songs that reach to your heart through their simplicity and honesty. And that's a rare quality, indeed.
6304712936|2.0|I'm doing a term paper on Mozart for an elective course, and I must say, the film \\"Amadeus\\" is so far from fact that I couldn't really enjoy it.  Just don't watch it thinking you're going to learn much of who Mozart really was.      He and his wife produced six children, for example - the movie shows only one.  Wouldn't the death of 4 of his kids in infancy made him slightly less chipper?      Of course I loved the snippets of music; who wouldn't?  But it was more like a smooth melding of \\"Greatest Hits Melodies\\" than a chance to really get into his music.     Can someone recommend - can someone MAKE - a movie that really does Mozart justice?    This movie is really a Johnny One Note.

B000P0J0AQ|4.0|After the death of good science fiction movies in 1994, the genre made a strong comeback with the release of the highly publicized \\"The Matrix\\". Since then, the film has become a common cultural reference, and copied in the stylization and use of slow motion.     It was only recently, on a boring friday, alone in my room with my Xbox, that I finally decided to view \\"The Matrix\\". I rented it off of Xbox Live, and immediately became sucked in by action sequences I recognized from more recent films, films which no doubt had used the Matrix as a large source of inspiration.    The films main strength lies in it's visual appeal. consistently switching between the gritty harshness of the real, machine-ruled world, and the slick, sterilized feel inside the Matrix and other computer programs. The film impliments visual styles never before seen in any film, and created a world, streching the limits of the human imagination.    The films second strength, is in it's mind-bending philosophies. What is the true state of existance? Is what you know reality, or simply a veil to a bigger picture. Questions such as these that go wild within the human mind but are never able to be truly communicated with others. The film draws heavily on Christian and Bhuddist philosophies and concepts.    Very few times has such a mix of both action and philosophy been but together in film form. Thus creating such an automatic appeal to the viewers.    But as with most films, \\"The Matrix\\" does come with its own flaws. As with many science fiction and action films. These biggest flaws lie in the ending. As with films such as \\"Terminator 2\\" or \\"Iron Man\\" the film succumbs to typical \\"Spiderman-ish\\" cornyness toward its ending, that does not seem fitting with the mature vision the rest of the film contained.     Although sequels offer logical reasoning for the over-played sequences toward the end, it still feels as if to little explaination is left to be fully satisfying.    One thing that has to be fully understood with the Matrix, is that it is almost completely dependant on its sequels to be complete. Not all is resolved in the end (in fact, not even the main conflict is resolved). It is truly a three-part saga, and is what it should really be viewed as.    Science fiction lovers will (and have) found this film to put a fresh perspective on the genre and will love this movie for years to come. Non-geek people will probably enjoy most of it, particularly the concepts which are introduced in the movie.    8/10 stars

B001S0WEVE|5.0|This book is for anyone who wants to have a deeper understanding of how we evolved.  It is also for anyone who wants to understand how science researchers go through the exciting process of developing theories and then finding evidence to prove their theories through observation and experimentation.  Neil Shubin combines paleontology, embryology, anatomy, and genetics to tell a compelling story of how modern mammals evolved from fish over the last 380 million years.  Although not a scientist, I had no difficulty reading this book with the occasional reread.  As a popular work, it is more detailed than Karl Segan and a lot easier to read than Steven Hawkins.  I really enjoyed \\"Your Inner Fish\\" and I have been passing it around to my friends.

The Bright-Red vinyl is the whole album and the Bright-Yellow one is the Remix Album - it contains remixes of \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" & \\"Hot N Cold\\".  For vinyl collectors, and of course for Katy Perry's fans, this is a true piece of memorabilia!
1400063515|3.0|Yes Mr Taleb can be very loose with his arguments, yes he spends a third of the book rehashing the points in \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" and yes he spends another 30 or so pages bashing many philosophers, economists and general thinkers. With all that, this book is still quite enjoyable and, at times, a very real eye opener.<br /><br />Once again we are warned of the dangers of examining the world as if it was gaussian - as if it was a simple model (or that idealized models actually give useful real world advice). This warning seems prescient given what happened to the world economies starting in late 2007 (the book came out before the collapse). He also gets bonus points for dissing game theory, especially when applied to economics. Well done Mr Taleb!<br /><br />If this wasn't a rehash, or maybe if it was better presented (less an obvious rehash) I would have enjoyed this book much more. As it is, if you haven't read \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" you'd get the gist here (though I think that is a better book). If you have read \\"Fooled...\\", \\"Black Swans\\" is more of the same. Still enjoyable but with a strong deja vu.
0060594896|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone searching through the \\"law of attraction\\" books and other similar themes.

He has obviously proven himself worthy of writing such a book, and the lessons you will take away will change all areas of your life.
157270487X|2.0|Unexpectedly, the movie was much more inspiring and well written!    The book is a quick easy read and pretty much average in execution.  You can see how the movie took the premise and started, but I'd actually give Simon Beaufoy much more credit as a writer!    The chapters are broken down into the questions from the quiz show and the backstory explaining how he knew the answer.  The only question the book and movie have in common is about the maker of the revolver.  This may be good though in if you knew the questions from the movie, reading these chapters may still be interesting.    There is an overemphasis on rape and homosexuality which detracts from the overall story.  One of the characters lives in constant suspicion of molestation!    The conflict is resolved pretty easily and somewhat unrealistically.  A hitman for example is fooled into killing one of their enemies!  Another chapter and question focuses on Vodoo aka shaggy dog story!  You then have cheating spouses, domestic abuse, secret agent ambassadors, and prostitutes w/ a heart of gold.      The ending is somewhat interesting to see the protagonist's real motivation for entering the quiz show.  But even this critical conflict is resolved in a less satisfying way.  I'll just say that he's bought off and lucky not to have been arrested right away.    Don't expect to see any of the following from the movie in the book:  Scene where Jamal jumps into the latrine hole to get Bacchan's autograph!  Latika!  Confrontations between Salim and Jamal and Salim's eventual redemption  Scene where Jamal's given a hint by the quiz show host and uses it to guess the opposite answer.  Latika's phonecall/helpline (Yes I know I mentioned Latika already)

The writing was lame and very predictable and the whole \\"aliens answer all questions\\" thing just didn't work for me.  I remember a time when movies (not just Indiana Jones) were well written.  Now it seems that if the writers get stumped they just throw aliens at you.  I think its very upsetting when you are expecting an explanation that you couldn't see coming from a mile away.  I wouldn't be surprised if the writers of the T.V. show lost gets stumped and throws aliens in as a cop out.

Oh to be young, willowy, smartly dressed and able to tango with an elegant man like Mr Pacino!

The book is not for everyone, especially those who are married to a particular paradigm... but for those who would like to learn and question what they think they know, this is a great start.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I did not get the chance to see Canadian Leonard Cohen perform last summer at the O2 Arena in London. This two disc set is the next best thing though  His deep voice  sounds mysterious, but it can also be very sensual and soothing.  I love his well known songs like \\"Bird On A Wire\\" and the stirring \\"Hallelujah\\". \\"First We Take Manhattan\\" and \\"Dance Me To The End of Love\\" are definite highlights here. I also like a lesser known song of his entitled \\"Suzanne\\".  This is a bittersweet love song featuring Cohen's beautiful guitar playing.  I love the song \\"Democracy\\".  This song makes me think about all the sacrifices people have made for democracy around the world.  \\"Boogie Street\\" is a smooth song featuring Sharon Robinson.  This song is about getting back into the rhythm of life.  \\"If It Be Your Will\\" is a beautiful song featuring the Webb sisters.  I love the music of Leonard Cohen on this two disc set.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|In conjunction with Microsoft Streets and Trips 2009 I was able to travel from northwest Arkansas all the way to Panama City Beach, Florida and back in no time during spring break 2009.  I received up to a maximum of 11 satellite signals which was quite impressive.  The powerful magnet on the back sticks to your car's metal surface firmly while the rubber seal keeps it from moving around.  I traveled with it to PCB dry and came back in a dark and stormy night across three different states.  The rain was ridiculous.  I couldn't see 5 feet in front of me and there were floods everywhere but the USB GPS keeps on ticking!  Did I mention it was waterproof?  I'd highly recommend this product to anyone!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is an excellent little flash unit, compact, fast recycling times, adequate power, accurate TTL metering (with D90). A limitation is that although the flash head rotates upwards and slightly backwards the flash body itself does not rotate, so if you are shooting portrait orientation you can't bounce the flash off the ceiling or back wall. You would need to use a reflector which is not so convenient when out and about.  All right you can get an off-camera cable for $30-40 but I would rather pay extra for the body to swivel laterally about the hot shoe which would have made it an incredibly versatile little unit. I still like it lots.

B001PPLIEG|2.0|I'm another fan of the Bond films. I was also looking forward to enjoying this latest adventure. I too got disappointed with the quality of this quantum...    To make it short, the reason why I was disappointed is because of the film as a whole. I feel that there were so many weaknesses in so many aspects that I just cannot give it more than 2 stars. One of the weakest Bond, and certainly a film that will NOT be reminded as a reference (unless it is taken as a \\"how not to\\"). If you are satisfied with this, or in a hurry, skip directly to the conclusion. If not, read on....    Now, to the longer explanation, with more details and observations :    - The first minutes of the film are stunning. Spectacular chase on Italian roads. A couple of necessary explosions and several collisions. But then, ouch.... An ugly song, not captivating at all. Really un-bond and, unfortunately, an annunciation of the rest to come, because the soundtrack is just simply forgettable.   - The number of attractive girls appearing in the film is minimal. Sure, Olga Kyrilenko and Gemma Arterton aren't ugly at all, but how can it be that the more Bond type of girl makes a one minute (if that) appearance in the film ? (I am referring to the girlfriend of the Italian retired spy-informant that Bond visits to try and find help). Oh, shame on me, I was about to forget the receptionist at the hotel in Port-au-prince. She also fits better the description of a Bond girl than Olga and Gemma.  - What ? no gadgets ? no bionic earpiece ? no potion that turn a bad guy into an angel ? Yes, I know, Q is gone, but did the inventions sequence have to go with him as well ? After all, that has always been one of the traits of character of the series.  - Er.... no Martini ? Even if not shaken and stirred ? The drink(s) Bond is having aboard the Airbus 380 (didn't know any airline was flying to La Paz with that aircraft, but whatever) isn't like anything I've ever heard before.   A complicated recipe, explained toofast by the \\"waiter\\" (too fast, remember that, because we'll come back to it). Not sure what they were trying to communicate there...  - The landscapes and shots are nothing like what we were used to in the past. I can't remember a single shot for which I said \\"WOW\\". Like other reviewers pointed out, we had super shots from India, Thailand etc in prior releases. Now we get the impression everything is a dump, with dark colours and contrast that have you wondering if your tv is OK (I have a plasma Pioneer, not a low end tv). Even the shot of the bay after the infamous duel in the port between Bond's turbo fisherman boat and the supersonic dinghys belonging to the General is subpar. Another Bond trademark that goes out the window. That makes 4, and counting. And yes, I agree with the nonsense of the hotel, with no clients, and in the middle of nowhere.   - Weak dialogs and no sense of humour (another trademark). The remark about the Italian not minding to be thrown in a dump when dead is simply unworthy of the series.  - The cast of characters is weak, not to say flabby. The only ones that fly above that are Craig and Judy Dench. But why surround them with these really bad actors ? Felix is simply pathetic and non-credible. The General is anything but an actor, just like the rest of his lieutenants. The Villain is mediocre. His assistants are insignificant. And we can go on. Where are all the true actors from prior installments (Patrick McNee, Christopher Walken, etc ?). If you don't want to get an expensive actor, at least get a credible one. Or get Mickey Rourke.   - Speed. Back to that issue. You want to pick up the pace, so the spectators don't fall asleep ? After all, Bond films are action oriented. But there is a difference between action packed (marketing label), and vertigo. I had vertigo at times and couldn't follow what was going on. No, I'm not senile, I don't have mad cow disease or any attention deficit. Things just go too fast too often.   - Excessive violence and \\"bangs\\" and \\"booms\\". It saturates after a while, especially when it is for no particular reason, like another reviewer rightly points out. I remember going to the cinema with my father each time a new Bond came out. That was a great moment for me. However, I am sure that, even today, I wouldn't take a ten year old to watch this.   - Nonsense. Can someone explain to me for example what the fight in the Haitian hotel was about ? Not a single word exchanged, yet the guy gets his carotid slit, and starts bleeding like a pig on the balcony ? What does that bring to the story of the film ? What about the hotel in the desert ? Perla de las Lunas ? Huh ? And the General trying to rape the waitress ? and so on.  - Plagiarism. The chase on the balconies and roofs is a bad copycat of the Bourne series. The \\"secret\\" agent (who then happens to be just a clerk, figure that one) dies covered in petroleum, just like the girl who betrayed Auric Goldfinger died covered in gold, over 30 years ago.     The good stuff : Craig is excellent, second best to the best, Sean Connery. He's close to what Ian Fleming was describing in his books, but this film doesn't do him justice. They must keep him, but also must come up with a much better film next time. No matter how good he is, he just follows the script and the director's orders...    Conclusion : Quite sadly, to me this feels more like a film made for the DVD industry than a widescreen cinema film. There are good and many not so good things that overall make it an uneven and inconsistent film. I like action, but I also like to dream, I like witty comments and dialogs, I like a story to be somewhat credible. This one doesn't do any of that for me. So, my advice is to skip this one and wait for the next Bond, or watch Casino Royal again, or look for something else if you are into action films that make some sense and have personality.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Cream sounds better than ever. This is a great DVD. If the camera work was better (why look at the inside of an elevator at Royal Albert or some rather unattractive women when the camera should be on the stars). Despite the less than stellar cinematography this seems to show these 3 guys at their best. I wish the DVD contained more songs and longer interviews.
1416575464|1.0|This book seems made by a bunch of (pretentious) college kids who think their \\"decorated\\" dorms look wonderfully sophisticated.  (I wonder how old the people who gave it 5 stars are...)  It is a collection of pretentious, childish pictures.  The vignettes (or whatever the little descriptive texts are called) are right on top of the pictures, cutting most in half and making it really annoying.  Also pictures are of very low quality, with too much light and too small.  To make a long story short, a very bad little book.  I wish I could give this book half star.
0553582461|3.0|I first read the Farseer series and it completely amazed me. I experienced every emotion humanely possible while reading the series almost non-stop. Then I came to the ending and was shocked. It was just sort of chopped off and incomplete. Then I discovered the Tawny Man series and was thrilled, although I did think 15 years was a long wait for Fitz to return to Buckkeep, but I understand why when taking into consideration the characters needed for the plot.     Once again, in this book she captures the reader's imagination and draws you deep into the book. Well written with strong growing characters. She has a way of giving the reader very intrinsic details and drawing on the readers emotions to make them almost real. Detail alone would be boring. She should have stop shortly after the dragons were free because she killed the ending. I just didn't feel the love in this series. In the Farseer series it was intertwined and part of the story. I could actually feel the love between him and the other characters, especially Molly. This series, and more this book, lacked that emotion. She made issues concerning love as mostly a glancing pass but never strong enough to pull you into it. Like saying the prince loved the princess, and that was it. (Not in exactly like that, just trying to make a point) In the end it seemed that she was tired of the series and wanted to end it. Through both of these series she was able to grab the reader by the collar and pull you into the story. In the last 200 pages it felt like she was trying to push you away. I would have liked to see the same detail put into the developing relationship with his daughter, and even Molly again. In the end it made me feel cheated and wanting more. I guess that's what happens when you want to kill a trilogy.
B0016OMFPW|3.0|This is certainly a pleasant sounding album and aptly titled. For those who like to categorize their music one might say that this is smooth jazz on steroids but there is little food for either the soul or the brain in most of the 13 tunes on this CD. Roy Hargrove's playing is near perfect but it appears he demands a little less from his saxophone playing sideman, Justin Robinson who's soloing lapses into near sloppiness at times. However,there are some memorable tunes on this CD.\\"Bring It On Home To Me\\" is a terrific tune (apparently live) that captures the entire quintet on a high note. \\"Mr Clean\\" and the opening track \\"I'm Not So Sure\\" are tight cohesive example of the talent that could have made this a better CD. A Hargrove CD that is truly worthy of the 5 stars reveiwers here heaped on \\"Earfood\\" is the trio recording with Stephen Scott and Christian McBride,\\"Parker's Mood\\"
0385486804|4.0|An emaciated, decomposing body of a young man was found in an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness. He died of starvation. For 16 weeks, he had lived off the land, adopting the lifestyle of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. But he went in without a large calibre rifle to hunt big game. No proper map, no axe, no compass, no radio. When this made the news, many Alaskans judged that the victim was stupid and arrogant even before his identity could be established.<br /><br />The deceased turned out to be one Chris McCandless. From a well-to-do family, he had graduated with honours from Emory University. But instead of embarking on a promising career, McCandless donated his entire savings to charity, changed his name and went tramping. He even sneaked into Mexico by canoe and slipped back into the US by sea. He worked at fast food outlets, living out of a backpack, in search of a more meaningful, romantic  existence of Jack London and Leo Tolstoy.<br /><br />His biggest challenge was to live off the land in the Alaskan wilderness. He started in spring, made an abandoned bus his base camp and lived on wild fruits, squirrels, porcupines and other small game. He managed to shoot a moose, but wasted the meat when he failed to preserve it. When McCandless felt that he had enough and was ready to return to civilisation and write a book, but it was summer, the rivers were all swollen and he could no longer ford the river he had so easily crossed in spring.<br /><br />McCandless returned to the bus, failed to hunt any big game, got poisoned by mouldy seeds, was too weak to hunt or gather fruits and gradually starved to death.<br /><br />Amid the criticism from most quarters of society, Krakauer tries to balance the views by painting a sympathetic picture of the young man. He tells of his own youth when he did a solo ascent of Devil's Thumb in Alaska. He described his upbringing which was quite similar to the autocratic style of McCandless' parents. Krakauer's defence of the young McCandless is so robust that I wondered if it's the same Krakauer who gave us the preachy and finger-pointing Into Thin Air.<br /><br />If only McCandless had a good topo map with him, he would have realised that he was not that far off from civilisation. He could have crossed the Sushana River or reached a ranger's cabin when it was time to call it quits. Krakauer seems to be very forgiving towards these mistakes but judge his fellow climbers on Everest using a very different yardstick.<br /><br />It's a gripping, well-written book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. However, I find it difficult to agree with the author's defence of a foolhardy, cocky, irresponsible young man's actions.wondered if it's the same Krakauer who gave us the preachy and finger-pointing Into Thin Air.

1594481784|5.0|I have a big problem finding books that hold my interest - I finish about 1 out of 5 of them, but I indeed finished High Fidelity and found myself shirking what I should be doing in order to read.    High Fidelity is largely focused on the thoughts, feelings and remembrances of a Londoner in his mid-thirties who's been stuck for years at the same stage of life where everything revolves around music and relationships.  The book was released in the mid-90's but really feels like early-mid-80's to me, smack dab in the vinyl/cassette era. I really identified, as I remember holding the same values, fears, and conflict about adulthood as Rob.  Maybe a guy thing, but I usually don't have the patience for long passages that take place solely in the head of a character, but I really enjoyed the style and method of expression in High Fidelity.  I wish I could read it again for the first time.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|This is the movie of the year?  There're dozens of foreign films out there with similar stories, and more beleivable.  Did the academy get all mushy and bleeding heart overnight?  First of all, the story lacks plausibility and very high on coincidence many times.  The back and forth between the game show and his dubious story is grating.  Secondly, the movie is terribly dark about India.  Supposedly everyone there is a con man, pedophile, or mafia thug.  The movie is more of a condemnation than glorification of India.  And how about the part where they fall off the train and land right in front of the Taj.  India's such a small country, I guess that happens all the time??  And the tourists give the kids a $100 note, what?  There are just way too many trite and serendipitous things that happen in this movie, and the ending obviously is way too strongly telegrahed.  It seems the credulous members of the academy don't get out much to the foreign cinemas and are entraced by negative stereotypes and fairytale story lines.  This movie was quite disappointing and is a malignment of the human condition.  But hey, it had the millionaire format, so that was cool right??  thumbs down
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've used the headphones heavily for 4 months now - I travel by plane a lot and work in a noisy environment - the headphones are great for both.<br /><br />I originally looked for noise reducing phones but found that the decent ones are very pricey, don't have great sound quality and comfort (the degree to which headphones reduce noise is largely determined on how tight the phones fit).<br /><br />I chose these as the best balance between sound quality, price, and noise reduction (fully covers ears).  I couldn't be happier with them.  They muffle out background noises effectively on the plane, allowing me to get lost in an audiobook or tune.  I often fall asleep with them on while traveling so I can vouch for their comfort.<br /><br />In the office they help me prevent distractions - ambiance audio works especially great to help keep me focused.  My ipod has no problem delivering plenty of volume through them.  I often wear them 4+ hrs. a day.  At times my ears get a bit warm but I think that's a trait of all ear-covering phones.<br /><br />They fold into themselves into a lump which fits into an included storage bag and fits well in my travel bag. Sound quality is excellent - my untrained ears can really hear differences in recording fidelity.
B000002MTR|3.0|OK I have a confession to make. I pre ordered this and still have the free sticker they gave you for doing so. So keep that in mind Pepperites later on in the review when I am less than sold on this disc. OK?<br /><br />Released in 1995 this album was the follow up to the ridiculously successful Blood Sugar Sex Magik opus and the Chilis are to be soundly praised for not just trying to repeat the formula. Used as a single, Warped opens up the albums account with pretty much the closest thing to heavy metal on the album, swirling sounds devolving into a vortex of circular sounds, a feeling used as inspiration for the video. However things move into more familiar quirky rock with track two, Aeroplane.<br /><br />Taken as a whole this was a brave move in some ways as the band take their predilections to their logical conclusion and the results - such as the rockin' paeon to thinking for yourself Shallow Be Thy Name - are sometimes pretty good. However overly simplistic stuff like Pea doesn't really 'do it'. Funk rock structures abound and for an example of this sample yourself One Big Mob or Deep Kick or ... well most of the album actually is still replete with this bouncy vibe this band pretty much owned on BSSM.<br /><br />It's also nice to see the band try a few different studio tricks and experiment with new things such as the childrens choir on the aforementioned Aeroplane. As per my earlier statement, the band didn't just try to do BSSM pt2.<br /><br />But there are problems. Last album, all this was fresh to many in the mainstream and had the element of surprise. Here many of these tricks we've seen before, the overly self conscious 'wacky' musical behaviour. And the problems arise when this descends from wacky to stupid. Like the silly romper room choral inflections on Deep Kick.<br /><br />Critically this was a bust. It seemed to me at the time to mark the beginning of the end as sales were down, excitement and hype trailed off and even though I thought parts of this were brave it seems the mass public only had the patience/indulgence levels required to accept one album of funk-o-matic hard rock from these guys. And the band took the lesson to heart, morphing into something else entirely and have a second bite at the cherry, producing great music of a different hue.<br /><br />But all up this isn't their best by far and really only rates three stars.ic only had the patience/indulgence levels required to accept one album of funk-o-matic hard rock from these guys.

B000AA305M|5.0|David Gray is a real musical artist, to me this album is a true masterpiece.  I purchased the enhanced version with the DVD video showing some of the authoring sessions. No question he is driven by producing his own style of music whether or not it gets any airplay.    Like most of his work I've heard, Life in Slow Motion isn't uplifting.  David Gray is probably unparalleled when it comes to masterful articulation of despair and emptiness in life.  The cover scene is a perfect metaphor - somewhat gloomy - but beautiful as well.  A good album for a winter's day.

Kate is afraid of flying so she stays home in her newly adopted country, Canada; that is until Charlie finds a French goddess (Susan Anbeh) and calls the whole thing off. Kate won't stand for this and gets up the courage to fly. On her way, she meets an obnoxious Frenchman Luc Teyssier (Kevin Kline). Little does she realize that their paths will cross again and again.<br /><br />As in the movie \\"Boys' Night Out (1962) with Kim Novak\\", Kate, Charlie, and Luc, only know what they are supposed to want in life. They pursue their wants until they find that they really want something different than they were supposed to want. That is a lot of wants.<br /><br />Lots of action, one-liners and great music (French Kiss: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.) I notice that all the time Kate is in Paris that she just misses seeing the Eiffel Tower by a few seconds. She does find an Eiffel Tower souvenir that reminds her of Luc.<br /><br />Everyone is perfect for the part. I would almost thing that Kevin Kline was French. Laurent Spielvogel plays the Concierge and has the attitude that Johnny Carson always says the French have. Even Jean Reno (birth (location) Casablanca, Morocco) seems exceedingly French.<br /><br />[[ASIN:6302985293 Boys' Night Out [VHS]]]

B001PPLIEG|1.0|As a 65 year old woman who has seen all the Bond movies, I was so disappointed in this one. I loved Casino Royale and expected something on the same level, but instead I got a chopped up, difficult to follow movie which made me want to fast forward through most of it.<br /><br />Where were the `cool' gadgets, the pretty gals, the glamour, a bit of humor and a menacing main villain usually associated with Bond movies?  I love action movies as much as the next `guy', but I want it woven into a story line not just `thrown' in for effect.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are forgettable, with the exception of Giancarlo Giannini's role, and he was brutally killed off for no reason.  I can understand a darker Bond after his recent lost, but unless you saw the Casino Royale, it doesn't make sense - a flash back to a happier moment would have helped.  I don't know if it was the writing, the directing or the editing, but in my opinion this was disaster!  I'm thinking of watching Casino Royale again to get the bad taste out of my mouth.  Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are both fine actors and deserved a better vehicle then this movie.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|I have great respect for Danny Boyle, even though I've disliked or felt indifference for most of his films, with the exception of \\"Trainspotting\\". His latest film, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", is undeniably enjoyable.  Each member of the cast was excellent, Boyle himself was in top form, and the plot was well-constructed.  However, I felt that the film lacked any real sense of social commentary on the issue of poverty.      Poverty in the East, and certainly in India, is a gruesome and desperate state that most people in the Western world can barely fathom.  \\"Slumdog\\" never truly addresses this problem.  Based on the conversations I've had with people who enjoyed this film, most of them are struck by the horrendous living conditions of the three main characters only momentarily, and then their shock is seemingly swept away by the inspirational ending.  Poverty and its effects of disease, illiteracy, desperate hunger, and social exclusion does not seem to resonate with many viewers.  The film does not instill any sense of urgency about the issue, which is a shame considering that there are approximately 2.8 billion people in the world who live at least as badly, and in many cases worse, than the film's main characters.    So, if you're looking for a great story, then you can do much worse than \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\".  If you're looking for a film that makes more of a statement on the issue of poverty, I suggest you look into the superb Brazilian film \\"City of God\\" and the American documentary \\"Born into Brothels\\".

The book claims that this is coming from the narration of the Winchester brothers but in my opinion it didn't feel that way at all.  The best parts of the book where the brief mentions of parts of the episodes from the show and the explanations given in more detail than what you get from watching the show.  Again, those were few and far between.  There should have been some pictures from the show in with the book also, to go along with the drawings.  This book was a good idea, but poorly executed.
0930289234|5.0|This graphic novel is definately not your father's comic book.  It's dark and more adult oriented.  But it's also some of the most creative writing and illustrating you'll find.  I loved it and I recommend it highly!
B00005N6KG|2.0|These headphones are definitely a bottom tier set. The frequency response is poor at both ends of the spectrum and everywhere in between. The sound reproduction quality is muddy. They distort badly at a relatively low volume. They still beat ear pods which for me, are an abomination. Keep a set handy for those times when your others are broken or \\"lost\\" somewhere in your home or auto.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|The best and most interesting of the series.  Bella, and the story, have graduated high school.
B000JIJPZY|4.0|We started using this gym when our son was 2 months old.  He absolutely loved it.  Every time we spun the ball and the cat made music our son went crazy with glee.  He is now 4 1/2 months old and he still likes it, but he does seem to get bored with it quicker and he likes his larger play mat better.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|It took quite a few listens for me to like it when I first bought it.  I was initially disappointed but grew to love it even more than the others.  Now, years later, it's my favorite.  I'm older now and it strikes more of a chord with me.  Who knows, maturity?  Great!
B001DEXDNI|5.0|As always, the talent of this lady always amazes me. great collection of songs done extremely well. get it!
B0019MLVEM|4.0|I first heard of The Script from commercials on MTV. The short sound clip caught my attention right away. After hearing it a couple of times, I was convinced I should buy the cd. When I researched the band, I realized that the lead singer was formerly in a band of which I also own a cd. So really, this is a comeback story... lead singer Danny has hit the scene with a new sound, gaining more popularity and singing from his soul. The songs are original, and the band claims to not follow a \\"formula\\". Indeed, when looking at the lyrics for their hit single \\"The man who can't be moved\\" it reads like a story. There isn't even a chorus that is repeated.     This band has been compared to U2 or Maroon5, but I think they are entirely different. The soulful singing of lead singer Danny reminds me of Robin Thicke's original album before he crossed over to r&b music. The background vocalists of The Script also play a key role in the songs. The general music melodies and beats are playful and uplifting despite the serious or melancholy content of the lyrics.      I would say the target audience for this band is ages 15-35, and the songs are powerful enough to create an excellent live show. Check for clips online of their live performances; they are amazing.
0312427573|5.0|Wolfe is one of the best of modern writers.  This exciting, complex adventure shows us the vanities and corruption in the cultures of the amoral rich on Park Avenue, the criminal and demagogic elements in the Bronx ghetto, and the self-serving power-hungry members of news media, politics, and courts of law. The book is much more interesting and insightful than the movie!  There aren't many heroes among the main characters, but, from the superficial social gatherings of the rich, to the wrong turn of his Mercedes off the expressway into the  slums, to the terrifying hours in \\"unfriendly\\" jail cells, to the \\"Law and Order\\" drama of the courtroom, it's a real 'page-turner\\" which I found hard to put down.<br />[[ASIN:0553381334 A Man in Full]]  [[ASIN:0312424442 I Am Charlotte Simmons: A Novel]]  [[ASIN:0312427581 The Painted Word]]  [[ASIN:055338063X From Bauhaus to Our House]]
B000W7JWUA|5.0|if you include the expansions to this game it truly is never ending fun!  Even on it's own it stays fun and interesting.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|What a great compilation of songs on this one. I have bought CD's in the past because of one song and found out that the rest of the CD is not what I expected. This one, however, has been in my car for the past two weeks and I have yet to get tired of it.
B000AS4L16|5.0|Shoah is a pain-stakingly informative documentary told from the point of view of survivors, witnesses, and perpetrators. Without showing any footage or images from the 1930s or 40s, Lanzmann is able to get to the details that other documentaries fail to take into account. Meant to be watched in 2 viewings, I watched it in 4 and was still completely compelled.    This particular box set is the Korean edition, but because there are subtitles and English language settings, it is a better purchase than spending upwards of $120.
B0006L0LOS|4.0|Very mixed reviews here; if you are looking for a movie that identifies with Batman or similar heroes show, then you will enjoy every single minute. The acting, photography, colors, clothing and music are all perfect for such a show. If you are in such a mood, then read no more. Highly recommended.
0767903862|5.0|Bryson manages to convey enormous amounts of information and a fair bit of commentary about Australia in a fun, easy-to-read package that makes you care about the country, the people, the animals, the plants, and even the ancient bits of grey goo (that created the basis for all life on the planet) which are found in Australia.  Interesting, educational, and laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book which will make you want to read everything that Bryson has ever written and emigrate to Australia, buy an RV, and see the country.  Best travel book I have ever read.  Donald J. Bingle, Author of GREENSWORD
B001FBSMF8|1.0|I really love Chris Cornell's voice and wanted this to be good. I luckily sampled it first. This is absolutely awful. His previous album had a couple of good songs mostly carried by his great, unique voice. This one took a whole new direction. Right down the toilet in my opinion. I hope he can come back from something like this.
B001KVAMM4|5.0|The playing by Anne-Sophie Mutter on this cd is inspired.  Technically, of course, it is flawless, as are most recordings.  But what she adds in feeling, depth and emotion is truly inspired.  I highly recommend this recording.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|I was disappointed with this album.  A few of the songs are very \\"Muzak\\" like.  I miss the jazz influence of some of her earlier albums.  I would buy it again, but is not one of her best works.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold is the only band whose albums I can listen to straight through, without skipping any songs, and the self-titled album is no exception!  Some long-time fans have complained that it doesn't sound like the other albums; that they have a 'country' sound on a couple of their songs, and Shadows doesn't scream as much as he used to.  But one of the reasons that I love this band is because of their willingness to explore new sounds. They are a completely unique and original group, and in fact are a bit hard to place, genre-wise. \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" is an excellent album with something for everyone- blistering guitar solos and screaming vocals, but also thoughtful lyrics and complicated melodies.      If you're an old A7x fan, or a new listener looking for something new, you won't be disappointed by this album.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Everything about this movie was great!  The actors, story, directing, and everything else were excellent.  This movie was a drama with many comedic and heartfelt moments.  I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind who wants to learn the interesting true story of George Jung.
B000002UAF|5.0|A Hard Days Night CD just reminds me of the movie which was such a smash for a young hippie back then. It just showed you, if you had your eyes open, what the Beatles was up to.
0143038419|3.0|I actually enjoyed the book Eat Pray Love.  I almost didn't buy the book after reading the reviews here on Amazon but I rarely travel and was in the mood for a vicarious read about a woman who gets to travel to Italy, India, and Indonesia and spend a year enjoying a hedonistic lifestyle doing virtually nothing.  It's true that the author is incredibly self absorbed and very depressed and overly detailed oriented.  I thought the book would be a nice light read but it was actually quite an intense book.    Elizabeth Gilbert mixes well with native people from all the countries she visits and gives a realistic look at life in each country and each people's way of life.  She brings each country to life and shows how each country is so different from each other.  Her stories are amazing and the book is a memoir about a wonderful year and how she brings herself back to happiness and fulfillment after a crushing divorce and financial loss.    I really enjoyed this book and the third part of the book about Bali, Indonesia was the most enjoyable part for me.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Maiden are the best, bar none for my tastes.  Once they got Smith/Dickinson back, peak form instantly returned.  The three guitar attack is untouchable, and Janick Gers contributions continue to add layers to their sound.  Brave New World just jumps off the page at you, Dance of Death was solid, though underappreciated a bit.  A Matter of Life and Death at times reminds me of the mid to late 80's Maiden days, but in a modern context.  I like it a lot.  \\"Lord of Light\\" and \\"The Pilgrim\\" are a couple of standouts here.
0375707972|1.0|4/5/09 .. order placed 3/6/09 still have not received ... I have emailed seller and still no response.   Not very happy
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I totally enjoy watching this movie over and over.. It has imagination, love, heartache, everything I consider in a good movie.. Also very moving .. I love it.. I have referred it to my sister and Her daughters and they have to their friends..
B000025H0Q|5.0|I wish Nick would have a longer career and a longer life.<br />Bryter Layter it`s indeed a fantastic album, you don`t have to skip a single song each one is so emotionally charged and intense, in comparison to pink moon and five leafs left this album features a fantastic band following Nick`s chords at its best It`s hard to tell which song is my favorite in this album cause I Love them all. I own Nicks complete discography but this album to me is something really special. If I would have to recommend an entry to new fans this album will be it.<br /><br />The beauty about Nicks music is that even while he was clearly depressed all songs leave to your own interpretation, it`s like a living soundtrack on your own life, you will find comfort on those velvet chords and acoustic strumming paterns while listening to his beautiful voice.<br /><br />My recommendations:<br />Really get them all!!<br /><br />Bryter Layter<br />Five Leaves Left<br />Pink Moon<br /><br />(this were the only three albums released by Nick, Five leaves left was the first but he was unnoticed at the timem gorgeous album!! he went somehow notticed and gaining a following cult with Bryter Layter and consumed his own with Pink moon. A 4th album appeared later with 4 tracks that were going to be part of his 4th studio album that never happened plus a few other takes on tap, this album is Time of no reply.<br /><br />Worth it!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Still a classic.  My kids loved it (6 & 3) and it was fun to watch myself for all the memories it induced.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|love this cd. her voice is amazing. her songs are lovely. i could play this non stop and not get bored of it.
B000003N89|5.0|Love it. I'm happy.
0740748475|5.0|I am very impressed with the high quality of this book collection. Not only is it very complete with interesting biographical information on Bill Watterson, but the books themselves are very appealing due to the high print quality. I would recomend this set to any Calvin and Hobbes fan.
B00140PK6O|5.0|This is the type of classic entertainment a person can sit and get absorbed in, and also as background , as you do other things around the house, it keeps your interest..
B000TKW3E2|5.0|This is a great album to become a classic in a brief time. No wonder it made it for the Oscar as the best score in 2008. The opening theme - \\"Briony\\" - is simply stunning and has the power to revive in your mind the first images of the movie. What comes next is equally wonderful. An absolute \\"must\\" for soundtrack lovers and for those who saw this unforgetable movie.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Generation Kill is more realistic than your average war film because it's more boring. Don't get me wrong--I was glued to the set for every minute of every episode. The series features strong characters, great dialogue, and no little action, and those traits make it watchable. And what the series gets absolutely right is the sheer boredom that military service sometimes entails. \\"Hurry up and wait,\\" as they said during World War II or, as one of my college professors put it, \\"100 hours of boredom and one of sheer terror.\\"<br /><br />Generation Kill is adapted from the book of the same name by Evan Wright, but it's clear that the writers and producers have also incorporated material from One Bullet Away, the memoir by Nathaniel Fick, whom viewers will recognize as a platoon commander in this series. (Both books, by the way, are excellent reading--Fick's is one of the best I've ever read.) The series follows a platoon of Marine recon from Kuwait through the initial invasion of Iraq. Along the way, firefights break out with hostile jihadists, the company is ambushed, sent on seemingly pointless missions, and eventually arrives in Baghdad itself. And like I said--I was hooked from the very beginning.<br /><br />If you're looking for a more realistic view of the war fought by modern grunts, or even just several hours of good entertainment, Generation Kill is the ticket.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|this is a fantastic cd crammed full of awesome songs. also for 10 dollars it's an amazing bargain.
B000O5AYCA|4.0|I'm giving my award of \\" New Band of the year\\" to The National(they didn't come out this year but I just discovered them, so..NEW to ME)a good friend of mine gave me a copy of \\"Boxer\\" a few month ago and it hasn't left my CD changer yet. It's not difficult to fall for them. Their delicate and creative approach to song writing had quite a profound effect on me. While listening it sounds so familiar but at the same time something new and completely original. Hard to explain unless you hear them.  I can see some problems for new listeners. The singer's dead-pan, Ian Curtis like delivery and the slow tempo of a number songs may be a turn off but given a few listens you'll find that they're the band's strengths. The National seem to touch on the subjects of alienation, longing and maladjustment. The best example I think is in the track \\"Mistaken For Strangers\\" a song about running into and being forgotten \\"by your old friends\\". The \\"character\\" in the song seems to feel lost and fearful about being unwillingly forced into a ever changing and uncertain future. The National is a tremendously talented band who make beautiful music. I'm overjoyed to have found them and I think that we'll a long and happy relationship together. Waste no time and discover them for yourself.     Favorite tracks:   Fake Empire  Mistaken for Strangers  Brainy   Slow Show
B000EQ47HC|5.0|I used to have this CD 10 or 15 years ago. At a particularly low point I was forced to sell my entire collection for gas money on a move. Some how this was one of the last ones that I replaced. Lately I've been listening to this, and its 3 companion Boston CD's nearly non stop.<br /><br />In the last 2 months I've been putting the finishing touch on my soon to be released book, \\"Desert Storm Diaries - Letters From Home\\" and listening to Boston has really helped put me back in my 1990 Gulf War frame of mind, since I listened to some of these same tracks during the war!<br /><br />For more info on th book \\"Desert Storm Diaries - Letters From Home\\" please check out the blog [...]<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews on this site for this CD, so I'll leave the track descriptions to them. For me, it just took me right back to being on the ship, smelling the salt spray and jet exhaust... good stuff!<br /><br />Carlin
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I like the new album and I hope thay keep cranking thim out I like all the songs I cannot pick my fave. I like them all
B0001US62I|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago when it first came out. But I bought this for a friend, to add to his horror collection. In fact I purchased this and another movie called Mr. Frost, also from Amazon. The gift's running theme was the Devil and I thought Robert De Niro's performance as Satan in Angel Heart was excellent. Along with Jeff Goldblum in Mr. Frost. Just wonderful acting. For myself, my favorites as far as who played God's most beloved angel but got the boot are these 2, plus Viggo Mortensen in The Prophecy, and John Glover in Brimstone. Broke my heart when they didn't continue with the series. His version of the Devil was outstanding. Sighs.. He will be missed.. RIP.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|I was surprised to see the many negative reviews for Bruce Springsteen's latest CD.  I hesitated to buy it due to so many bad reviews, but picked up a used CD cheap on Amazon and was really glad that I did!  This is Bruce rockin' and rollin' at his best, like some of his earliest albums.  The title track, \\"Outlaw Pete\\", has such a catchy tune that I find myself humming it the rest of the day after listening to the album.  This is feel-good R & R music, and it's energizing. There are quite a few really strong tracks, including \\"Outlaw Pete\\", \\"This Life\\", \\"Life Itself\\", and the theme song from the movie \\"The Wrestler\\".  In his interview with the New York Times, Springsteen said that he felt that this was as good an album as he had done in a long time, and I agree.  His voice is strong, the arrangements are catchy yet polished, and the mood is fun and upbeat. This CD is holding its own in competing for play time with Emmylou Harris' \\"All I Intended to Be\\" in my player!
B00005JM02|4.0|Overall, a very good kid's movie.   Only...  My wife,myself & our 3 year old granddaughter agree, the search is too long. Too much pathos & sadness for too long a period of time... More \\"...Happily ever after...\\" Our G-Daughter has told us to go past the sad parts.
0810970686|5.0|I've got two 8 year old boys who love this book.  It's been read over and over.  Highly recommended for kids in the 8 - 11 year old range.
B001CFLHOA|4.0|This is a great reissue for the money. Most Mini LP cds cost around 30 bucks so for $[...] this is a bargain and is also one of my favorite live albums. Just dont expect any bonus tracks like the other versions of this cd.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|I will be the first to admit that I'm not much of a Bond fan.  I've never read one of Ian Fleming's books and this is only about the 4th Bond film I've watched.  Unfortunately, Quantum of Solice reminded me why.<br /><br />I could only make it through about an hour of the movie.  The non-stop violence got old very quickly.  I saw Casino Royale, Mr. Craig's first Bond outing, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I'm not sure if it was because I thought Mr. Craig was a better Bond or what--but it certainly had more story.  Quantum had minimal storyline used, solely it would appear, as a means of stringing together multiple chase scenes and shootings.  With testosterone overflow, they were going for the lowest common denominator with this one.  And there's certainly an audience for such...<br /><br />To give credit where it's due, however, the scenery was lovely.  :-)
0399230033|5.0|This book has very few words but the pictures are what make it so wonderful. My kids love to look through the book as each page has many funny things happening.     A book we read over and over again. But one they look through many times more.    *taken from my review at goodreads
B000002KY8|5.0|Although Purple Rain gets all the attention, 1999 is an equally superb record. It may be cliche to call Prince a musical genius, but it's absolutely true. On this LP, he blends funk, rock, and electronica, creating an original (and often imitated) sound. The album kicks off with the three superb singles: the paranoid embellishments of the title track, the lascivious, metaphorical \\"Little Red Corvette,\\" a slice of pop perfection, and the aptly-titled \\"Delirious.\\" Besides these well-known songs, \\"Something in the Water\\" predicts \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" with Prince's chilling shrieks of loneliness, \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\" is as lewd (and addictive) as it got in 1982, and \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" is as classic as it is shocking. Every track is a masterpiece musically, vocally, and lyrically. 5 Stars.
B001QB9H10|1.0|Boring, unimaginative, poorly constructed, badly written from start to finish. Was a waste of time.

0805087184|5.0|We've used this for learning colors, rhyme and animals. It's predictable so even the youngest can figure out what comes next. We often sing a song with it and use a flannel story as well.<br /><br />Every young child should have this book read to them over and over again.<br /><br />*taken from my review at goodreads
B001TAFCBC|1.0|This is nonsense galore. I bought it for Kate's sake. Tried to follow the movie but best I could do was to fast forward because this is a completely nonsense waste of time movie. I would not recommend it. Waste of money.
B000VHPZXE|5.0|For a guy who is blind, Stevie Wonder has a way of describing things in an amazing way!  He is a fantastic writer and this is a wonderful collection of some of his best work.  It does a masterful job of showing not only his writing, but his performance and musicianship.  If you are a casual Stevie Wonder fan, this would be my top choice to get familiar with his work.
143911000X|1.0|I may not be a \\"bro\\", but I can say that books like this, with their promotion of irresponsible sex, insulting stereotypes, and immature behavior are not really all that funny.<br /><br />  The book was a dead on satire of (sub)-Generation X male behavior, but is more than a laugh brigade because it also ENCOURAGES the kind of behavior it spoofs. Instead of simply being a satire, it crosses the line by endorsing immaturity.<br /><br />  Although some would say it is only comedy, it is also true that art and comedy influence and reflect what society thinks.<br /><br />  According to this book, it is okay to:<br /><br />*Evaluate a woman's attractiveness based on race (\\"Half Asian chicks= Multi-ethnic, multi-YES-nic! [points up!];  Lebanese?= Leba-PLEASE! [points down]\\")<br /><br />*Pan down to the lowest IQs in the country by using stupid phrases and slogans (see above).<br /><br />*Assume that all men use urinals or change in front of each other in locker rooms, and any man who doesn't feel comfortable with that is a geek.<br /><br />*Assume that there is something wrong with BEING a geek.<br /><br />*Assume that every man that age has had sex, lots of it, and in distasteful manners.<br /><br />  This book is written for 30-something-year-olds, some of whom are old enough to be elected President! Of those who don't become that influential, the rest learn to view women, gays, and other 'undesirable' people/lifestyles with contempt.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY:<br />  While this book was a brilliant commentary on modern male behavior, it gets only one star because it endorses rather than laughs about the behavior. Recommended only for use as a social study.
0439023483|5.0|I was pretty hesitant to read this book because, to be honest, the story line sounded awful. But my sister insisted that it was fantastic and that I should read it. And since she's so bossy I did. I'm glad I did. I loved it!     This is not a happy book for the most part. The characters have had hard lives and the main part of the book is set in a to-the-death competition. It was very well-written though and I had a hard time putting it down. Many people died here, but for the most part they weren't gross (well, one was). The characters were interesting and the whole idea of what America had become was intriguing.     Even though the book isn't 'happy' there was a feeling of hope and strength. That maybe change was possible although it might be hard. I didn't come away depressed or sad - I came away thinking 'that was a great book'. But be warned that there will be another book or maybe more so there's no closure.     The story is told in first person present which totally bugs me. I hate that style. After a while though it didn't bug and I was totally sucked in. So maybe I don't hate the style...     And I just want to give a shout out to Peeta and say that if he gets hurt in later books there will be PROBLEMS. I love that boy.     Go read this book. But read it before you hand it to your teens to make sure you're okay with it. I do think this is a great example of a fractured society, one without God, and much, much, much better than say, Lord of the Flies.    *taken from my goodreads review
B0001YRVN4|4.0|timely receipt.  Well packaged,  Dvd's all work, no skipping.  Box was a little rough, but for the price I'm satisfied.  Little boy loves them.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|I got this movie for a my niece and nephew for a steal, so if it stunk up the place, what's the harm? -- the first two times I watched it, I fell asleep, I don't know why... I just couldn't keep my eyes open -- the first time the kiddies watched it, they lost interest a third of the way through and made my little nap break a nightmare -- but ya know, we stuck with Horton and the Whos'-- and I have to say this movie has grown on all of us and I rather like it... Now, the babies are glued to the TV and on every viewing I like this movie more and more ... my favorite part being when Vlad(not the bunny, with the cookies:) takes the clover and we see Horton in an old spaghetti western influenced type scene... wow, that's great stuff, with the screaming trumpet and stuff!  As well as... the end, when the Who's work together to save their world.<br /><br />This one definitely ranks high on my list... great for kids and adults... there isn't much if any of that adult humor crud(i.e. Madagascar), which I mostly find inappropriate for young audiences even if they don't 'get it' yet... and though it isn't to the level of Pixar, I think they did a great job with this one...
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I was really looking forward to this album and was not let down at all but I still think Leviathon is still their finest hour,but Whoa this is a way different album indeed,gone are the deathlike vocals,what we have here folks is a way prog album like King Crimson or Yes or Rush gone more metal,even the song titles sound like Rush songs, would have loved to hear them do a cover version of 21st century schizoid man [ yes I know it has been done too death] {April Wine,Forbidden,Voivod,}to name a few,what we have here is like Ozzy singing a Rush album and it works fantastic the album just keeps getting better as it goes along and the last song [The Last Baron] is 13 glorious minutes of prog exctasy    Fantastic
1423101464|5.0|This was such a fun book. Lots of humor and mysteries to solve. Quite a bit of action as well. There is some boy/girl relationship tension which was great; poor Percy is so clueless about girls that I laughed outloud several times.     As with all 'the Olympians' series we meet quite of few of the Greek gods and monsters. Some we've met before and some are new. I think this is such a fascinating way to learn/remember Greek mythology.     I appreciate the fact that there is no bad language and that the violence isn't violent or bloody. Yes, there are evil people/gods/monsters and they do die, but it's never yucky. I'd feel comfortable letting my tweens read this series.     I absolutely love the chapter titles in the books. They are hilariously fantastic and I could read through them all day. Don't ask me to explain it but things like \\"I Have a Dam Problem\\", \\"Nico Buys Happy Meals for the Dead\\", \\"I Scoop Poop\\" and \\"Clarisse Blows Up Everything\\" just crack me up.     These are so well-written and easy to read. Love, love, love this series. And I can't tell you how incredibly sad I am to learn that the next one won't be out until next spring. Oh, the torture..    *taken from my review at goodreads

0739321870|4.0|The universe is truly an amazing and mind boggling place. The laws and theories that humanity has discovered over time are sometimes equally mind boggling. In this book, one of the most brilliant minds of our time has managed to make otherwise incomprehensible theories and facts relatively accessible to a mass audience. The book starts with a review of everything I learned in high school and college science classes, but then quickly moves on to explain relativity, quarks, various models of the universe, string theory, force carrying particle, wormholes, dark matter, and time travel. At times I felt like I was drinking from a fire hose, but when I was done I had a better appreciation for the world in which I live.

159448385X|3.0|The Kite Runner, Hosseini's debut novel, showed his true talent and the fact that he could really be something else. It was sad, but at the same time exciting and I didn't wanna put it down. I saw the movie when it got released and I really liked it a lot too, it was almost exactly like the book. So I must admit I was excited for A Thousand Splendid Suns.<br /><br />While I admit this was a solid book, it's not great. It has a good storyline and it has good characters, but I am not a fan of the way this book reads out.<br /><br />The story is the life of two Afghan women, Mariam and Laila, as they pass through life in Afghanistan. Both of them are married to a slob named Rasheed. Rasheed is a cruel and sadistic man who abuses them and beats them to death. The book showcases their lives through the years as both of them struggle to cope with Rasheed.<br /><br />The book has a good story and good characters, but the reason for this being only a 3 star book is due to the fact that it is VERY poorly written. Hosseini stretches out a short story to 400+ pages, and adds in extremely detailed descriptions of objects. Hosseini just TELLS us what happens as opposed to showing us what happens and at times he just says that one of the characters told someone else something without quoting it (\\"Mariam told him she did not.\\") And the second half of the book... takes... forever... to... get... anywhere.<br /><br />Another note is that normally I'm a fast reader, but this one took me literally a month to finish due to how slow it is. As a result, everything is just too safe. Not interesting safe, but boring safe.<br /><br />I really want to give this book a full 5 star rating. But I just can't. It's a good book and all, just it's not written very good, and there are LOTS that could have been done better. To Mr. Hosseini, PLEASE let your next book be better!

031606792X|5.0|There are about 150+ pages of this book that I love without exception.  (spoiler alert).  Jacob's section is necessary given the history and I understand it.  It's not exactly filler its completing new moon.  Bella's honeymoon is stagerly awesome as well and I was mezzzmerized.. hehe.  The end of the honeymoon had me really wondering what was going on now.  Then the burning began.  I really enjoyed all the details from the burning portion of this book.  (once you read it you will know what I'm talking about) Then the eyes open.  The next 150 pages or so are the most awe-inspiring of the entire series.  I litterly wanted more.  I wanted them to go on vacation and go do things and be happy.  To watch alittle charlie development and see what we were going to do about Renee.  See Bella in Dartmouth and dealing with the other schoolkids or anything.  I was so looking forward to it all.. then all hell breaks loose.  The book regains the highest levels of tension it ever has in all of the 1st 3 and it tears a path of destruction at a paniced pase for hundreds of pages.  and then with just a few pages left POOF we are back where we left off of our magical 150 pages... wanting to continue to experiance the magic.. and sadly the last word is printed...  I have never finished a series with such a magical and astounding completion of its whole.  It really does \\"end\\" well, but it leaves to the imagination the best part.  The happily ever after part.  I litterly want a coushy pampering 700 pages epiloge to start after book 4.  Maybee some of what I seek is in the never released \\"Forever Dawn\\" and maybe it really is.    What I really miss is the characters.. we didn't get to sit and spend time with them without unbelievable stress.  I want to know all about Jasper/Alice/Edward/Emmet/Rose(Carol)/and our 2 father Figures.. I wanted so badly that the book just keep flowing from those original 150 pages of new vampireness.. but it lead me somewhere with great suppense and happy joy atthe end.. I just truely truely want it to continue.  Please Steph.. think of Alice.  She see's you writing about her and is all giddy and prancing around like a small pixie ... thx.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Quantum of Solace is a very good follow-up to Casino Royale. Daniel Craig still plays a cold 007 still recovering from the death of Vesper Lynd in the previous film.     The film begins almost immediately after Casino Royale. Being a direct sequel, the film doesn't go back and recap previous events all that much, so I highly recommend seeing Casino Royale first. After the opening scene, the credit sequence is cool looking but I'm sorry to say the theme song is pretty tuneless and forgettable.     I won't go into detail, but the storyline is compelling as a continuation of the last movie. However, it is cut between chase scenes. They are good chase scenes and I don't mind action (it is part of the James Bond experience, after all), but there are a few too many in Quantum. They have everything: car chases, boat chases, plane chases, you name it! I just feel that much of the story was sacrificed for the sake of the action.     Olga Kurylenko is a very beautiful Bond Girl. She plays a very important role in the film. I admire that Quantum of Solace made little references to other Bond films like Goldfinger. The film answers many questions left after Casino Royale, but creates more yet to be answered. But the movie still has me hooked.         Despite its flaws, Quantum of Solace is a great James Bond movie!
B001MYIXAC|2.0|Not. Really.  Slow and uninteresting more aptly describes this one folks. While I take nothing away from the effort, it reminded me of another movie that came out a few years ago that was overhyped and quite disappointing - The Blair Witch Project.  Which is to say, after it ended, I found myself still waiting for something to happen.  Very. Disappointing.

1554072840|4.0|My daughter loves the bright colors and images in the book. Unfortunately, the \\"potty\\" looks more like a pitcher, and not anything like her potty. The dvd that goes with the book has a better looking potty than the book does. It's also a long read, and the word for vagina and urine are a little different from what my daughter knows. The book says the vagina is a pee pee and the urine is wee wee. I call her urine pee pee and her vagina is just that. My personal preference. The dvd is the same way, though.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Producer says, \\"Lets make a movie.\\" Writer says, \\"But we don't have a story.\\" Producer says, \\"Who, cares. I need some money so just toss together all the time worn scenes of old action movies.\\"  Proof in order (tell me if these are familiar): car chase; foot chase; fight next to ringing church bell; fall through sky light; fight on scaffolding; swing from ropes; grab gun at last second and shoot bad guy with unrealistic shot; boat chase; two airplanes in middle of nowhere desert ready to fly; unrealistic airplane chase scene in canyons; two people - one chute - jump at last moment from plane and with just 3 seconds of chute deployment at 135 mph happen to land in the only deep crevice in the desert; pretty girls in cars always show up at right moment; girl wants to kill bad people who killed her parents; bad people want to control resources; bad people are a secret organization; secret agent is suspect; finally, jump from burning building.   Now the real negatives: To make all the above seem a little different they used a lot of quickly changing and nauseating camera angles which totally fragments the story. Actors who can only memorize one line at a time which adds to the fragmented incoherence of the story. A supposedly high tech touch screen which is old school to my iTouch.

B001GXY92U|5.0|Mr. Fray is the best (so far) interpreter of these Bach's concerts.  Nevertheless his idol was Glen Gould, his concerts are much better, that any ever heard before (incl. Andras Schiff and others). He is still very young, but he feels Bach, not just plays him. As a French artist he is more capable of understanding J.S.Bach, as any other, not only German pianists. Additionally he makes the small chamber orchestra feel the same as they record the concerts together (The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen). The best way of showing how he thinks of Bach and feels him is the DVD - \\"Swing, Sing & Think\\" of Bruno Monsaigeon. Fantastic. We need more such young artists.

0743298039|2.0|Margaret Lea knows what it's like to be the sad woman, to be the bad woman, behind green eyes. (My apologies to Roger Daltry) Lea is plucked from obscurity to be the biographer of the most famous author in England~Vida Winter~a few months before Miss Winters croaks. Vida literally tells the very end of her story on her deathbed, even rousing at one point to give one more vital piece of information. Sutterfield doesn't convincingly establish Vida Winter as the greatest living author of her generation in my mind, so I had a hard time swallowing that confection. And even though we learn EVERYTHING about her life (even her vivid memories before her own mother is born), we do not learn where she gets her ability to create award winning fiction and the adoration of millions of readers who breathlessly await her next novel like I suppose people awaited Daphne du Maurier's next novel 80 years ago.<br /><br />My main issue with this novel is that is is filed under Historical Fiction when it really should be considered to be a romance/mystery (except there is no bodice ripping). The book tries to combine _Jane Eyre_, ,_Wuthering Heights_ and _The Woman in White_ into one, single tome, but ultimately fails as TRUE historical fiction. If one is a fan of the romance genres (I am not) then I suppose it is a fascinating tale of incest,  crumbling, gothic mansions replete with gardens, stone stair cases, rich, dysfunctional family their ghosts and their servants and (of course) English moors and rain. Every single disastrous problem is fixed with a hot cup of tea.<br /><br />I don't have anything against this type of thing, it's just mislabeled. It's an average romance masquerading as an important work of fiction. The Thirteenth Tale reminds me of all the above mentioned books, but all mushed together, instead of following one, elegant storyline.<br /><br />Vida and everyone in her family has copper curls and green eyes, and hardly a page goes by when we are not reminded of this fact. \\"Emerald and diamonds\\" ad nauseam whenever someone is crying.<br /><br />If you like this genre of books, then I think you will be quite pleased. It's lurid, voyeuristic and fantastical, and it doesn't lag. I \\"read\\" the audio version, which is serviceably performed and I don't have any complaints about the readers except that they are not outstanding. But reviewer's need to understand their genres. The only thing \\"historical\\" about it is that it probably takes place after WWII, but that is never mentioned. When I think of historical fiction, the setting is firmly fixed behind true events.

0316168815|5.0|Recently I decided it was about time to finish the book I had started so many months ago. I sat down one afternoon and read it all in one splurt. I think that for me, that's the way to do it. I can't do dissection. If you do that and get so wrapped up and the little miniscule things, you can't get the vibe and emotions of the book as well which I think is why I enjoyed the second half of the book A LOT.     You can clicky on the \\"Made to Last: The Lovely Bones\\" tag thing in the sidebar if you want to see what I thought of the first twelve or so chapters.    Now to the review-ish part:    I can definitely see why The Lovely Bones has left such a mark on the literary industry/on people everywhere. It's a book that works on so many levels. Alice Sebold is able to take a story of one family's tragic loss and turn it into a book that, no matter your experience, almost everyone will be able to relate to. She does it with eloquence and simplicity. She does it with almost poetic like prose at some points, and stark, brisk words at others. She knows how to manipulate your feelings, create amazingly deep and insightful characters, and most of all, make you feel along with the book.    It's one of the few stories that I've read that has really moved me and made me question the way I see things and the way I judge people. I think it's a book you have to read to believe. My pathetic words aren't going to do it any justice. And I don't think I want to over analyze it any more than I already have for fear of ruining it for myself.    So yeah, this is my crappy review.     Please read this book. It's amazing. It will move you. It will make you see things differently. And you'll love it.

I bought all there albums after that but ended up selling most of them or simply returning them. Nothing compares to staind class.I would not listen to some of the reviews from other people especialy M.B. Link tkdmateo. Saints in hell is one of the greatest songs any one has ever made. Halfords voice is amazing on this song very creepy and erie song. the hole album is very powerful and emotional.the album will hypnotist you from the guitars too robs voice. I would use extreme caution while listening too this album. If I would have to pick A weak song A would skip exciter and start listen from the second song. saints in hell is a sick sick sick song it really shows the range of halfords voice this song is worth the price of the album alone. all the other songs rock too except exciter. I own around 1,000 cds from iggy pop to  elvis and everything in between and this is deffently top ten.

B0025L5YCG|5.0|1. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition). The greatest trilogy in film history, presented in the most ambitious sets in DVD history, comes to a grand conclusion with the extended edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Not only is the third and final installment of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien the longest of the three, but a full 50 minutes of new material pushes the running time to a whopping 4 hours and 10 minutes. The new scenes are welcome, and the bonus features maintain the high bar set by the first two films, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.   Peter Jackson's trilogy has set the standard for fantasy films by adapting the Holy Grail of fantasy stories with a combination of fidelity to the original source and his own vision, supplemented by outstanding writing, near-perfect casting, glorious special effects, and evocative New Zealand locales. The extended editions without exception have set the standard for the DVD medium by providing a richer film experience that pulls the three films together and further embraces Tolkien's world, a reference-quality home theater experience, and generous, intelligent, and engrossing bonus features.     THE RETURN OF THE KING, the third and final film in Peter Jackson's THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, finds Middle-earth on the cusp of great change. Weary hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) venture further into the dark realm of Mordor, guided by the increasingly desperate Gollum (Andy Serkis), the two-faced former owner of the Ring that Frodo must destroy in the fires of Mount Doom. Meanwhile Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) contend with the deranged ruler Denethor (John Noble) at the once-mighty city of Minas Tirith, as Merry (Dominic Monaghan) joins Éowyn (Miranda Otto) and the Riders of Rohan to hold back the forces of Sauron. Amidst the chaos, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must rise to his destiny,aided by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) in assembling allies for a massive battle that will decide the fate of Middle-earth. With RETURN, Jackson brings J.R.R. Tolkien's world-renowned tale to a stunning conclusion. As with THE TWO TOWERS, the director deftly weaves various storylines together in one remarkable scene after another. Spectacular visuals complement Jackson's sharp focus on the characters and their emotional battles. While the special effects help to create huge battles and frightening creatures on a previously unseen scale, they never outshine the excellent ensemble of actors who bring the heart of the story home. A truly astounding work of filmmaking, THE RETURN OF THE KING skillfully concludes one of the greatest trilogies in cinema history.     Features:  Discs 1 & 2: Widescreen (2.35:1) version of the special extended edition of Return of the King, with more than 50 minutes added to the theatrical release by director Peter Jackson; four audio commentaries by director and writers, the design team, production team and the cast featuring more than 30 participants including Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom and academy award winners Richard Taylor, Howard Shore...and many more; cast commentary also features dialogue between split-personality characters Gollum and Smeagol (Andy Serkis); Dolby Digital EX 5.1 surround sound; DTS ES 6.1 surround sound; Stereo surround sound; English subtitles and closed captions; Spanish subtitles.

Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Platinum Series Special Extended Edition Reviews:    \\"...Peter Jackson has created the mack daddy of all movie fantasies, and RETURN OF THE KING brings the film version of Tolkien's trilogy to a combustibly exciting close...\\" -- Peter Travers, Rolling Stone  \\"...The conclusion of Peter Jackson's masterwork is passionate and literate, detailed and expansive...\\" -- Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly  \\"[K]ING is a meticulous and prodigious vision made by a director who was not hamstrung by heavy use of computer special-effects imagery.\\" -- Elvis Mitchell, New York Times  \\"As a model for how to bring substance, authenticity and insight to the biggest of adventure yarns, this trilogy will not soon, if ever, find its equal.\\" -- Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times  \\"[T]he third film propels the work into the stratosphere of classic movies. Key characters are enhanced, new civilizations visited and battles fought more intensely, even as feelings and motivations are plumbed more deeply and movingly.\\"-- Claudia Puig, USA Today  \\"RETURN OF THE KING dispatches its characters to their destinies with a grand and eloquent confidence. This is the best of the three...\\"-- Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times  ==============================================================================  2. Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition): The extended edition of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was perhaps the most comprehensive DVD release to date, and its follow-up proves a similarly colossal achievement, with significant extra footage and a multitude of worthwhile bonus features. The extended version of The Two Towers adds 43 minutes to the theatrical version's 179-minute running time, and there are valuable additions to the film. Two new scenes might appease those who feel that the characterization of Faramir was the film's most egregious departure from the book, and fans will appreciate an appearance of the Huorns at Helm's Deep plus a nod to the absence of Tom Bombadil. Seeing a little more interplay between the gorgeous Eowyn and Aragorn is welcome, as is a grim introduction to Eomer and Theoden's son. And among the many other additions, there's an extended epilogue that might not have worked in the theater, but is more effective here in setting up The Return of the King. While the 30 minutes added to The Fellowship of the Ring felt just right in enriching the film, the extra footage in The Two Towers at times seems a bit extraneous--we see moments that in the theatrical version we had been told about, and some fleshed-out conversations and incidents are rather minor. But director Peter Jackson's vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's world is so marvelous that it's hard to complain about any extra time we can spend there.    While it may seem that there would be nothing left to say after the bevy of features on the extended Fellowship, the four commentary tracks and two discs of supplements on The Two Towers remain informative, fascinating, and funny, far surpassing the recycled materials on the two-disc theatrical version. Highlights of the 6.5 hours' worth of documentaries offer insight on the stunts, the design work, the locations, and the creation of Gollum, and--most intriguing for rabid fans--the film's writers (including Jackson) discuss why they created events that weren't in the book. Providing variety are animatics, rough footage, countless sketches, and a sound-mixing demonstration. Again, the most interesting commentary tracks are by Jackson and writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens and by 16 members of the cast (eight of whom didn't appear in the first film, and even including John Noble, whose Denethor character only appears in this extended cut). The first two installments of Peter Jackson's trilogy have established themselves as the best fantasy films of all time, and among the best film trilogies of all time, and their extended-edition DVD sets have set a new standard for expanding on the already-epic films and providing comprehensive bonus features.     Not seen in theaters, this unique version of the epic adventure features over 40 minutes of new and extended scenes integrated into the film by the director. DVD set consists of four discs with hours of original content including multiple documentaries, commentaries and design/photo galleries with thousands of images to give viewers an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at the film. Frodo Baggins and the Fellowship continue their quest to destroy the One Ring and stand against the evil of the dark lord Sauron. The Fellowship has divided and now find themselves taking different paths to defeating Sauron and his allies. Their destinies now lie at two towers - Orthanc Tower in Isengard, where the corrupted wizard Saruman waits and Sauron's fortress at Baraddur, deep within the dark lands of Mordor.

The descriptions of the technologies used are very real and everything is within the realm of possibility, other reviewers opinions notwithstanding.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down and after finishing I am still thinking about it. The finish is the only part I didn't like, clearly it is leaving space for a sequel (called freedom(TM)). Character development is also a little lacking. Nevertheless, this is a great book to read and a great intro into a lot of topics of our time.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|In \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\", Woody Allen explores yet another variation on his central theme of complex sexual relationships, but this time through the lens of the tourist's camera. The tourist is Scarlett Johansson in her role as the restless Cristina, who has no idea what, exactly, she is compulsively seeking through the lens of her digital camera (Metaphorically, she begins to catch a glimpse of it only after she exchanges digital for film.). Both Cristina and her intellectual best friend, Vicky (Rebecca Hall), arrive in Barcelona, where they are quickly captivated by the attentions of an aspiring artist (Javier Bardem), who is encumbered by baggage--the baggage in question being his suicidal/homicidal wife, Maria Elena (played to the hilt by Penelope Cruz).<br /><br />Through the splendid cinematography of Javier Aguirresarobe, Allen makes it evident that the two friends are seduced as much by the spell of Spain in general--with its \\"gently weeping\\" guitars, midnight tapas and golden wines--and Barcelona in particular--with its magnificent art and architecture, ingredients that render the scenario, which in a more mundane setting would seem improbable, plausible. In other words, the city--the third ingredient of the title--works its magic both on characters and viewers, who are able to suspend their disbelief as one tends to do when actually traveling to the enchanting cities of southern Europe. Allen demonstrates this proposition with Vicky's husband and his friends who discuss nothing but computers and business affairs while her thoughts drift away with the notes of a classical Spanish guitar.<br /><br />Some reviewers have criticized the voice-over, but as far as I'm concerned, this straightforward device lent the film an old-fashioned charm. Others have criticized the intrusion of Woody Allen's narrative voice into the dialogue. And yes, there certainly are lines that one can \\"hear\\" Woody Allen reciting, but such intrusions made the film all the more enjoyable for me; and I suppose that the enjoyment of this film will depend on whether one likes Woody Allen's humor, or not. To some it may seem like the same old schtick; to others [as in the case of his title \\"Vicky Cristina\\"], Allen's idiosyncratic brand of humor represents the third ingredient without which his film would not seem complete.d I suppose that the enjoyment of this film will depend on whether one likes Woody Allen's humor, or not.

I have never written a review on here for anything before, but this movie was so bad and it made me and my boyfriend angry for wasting our time that I just couldn't contain myself.    Save yourself the $4 to rent it, and please don't buy it..stab yourself with a fork in the leg instead! You will be glad that you did!
0517548232|5.0|I was looking for a book on economics that would be quick and easy to read but was well thought out and detailed, and this book nailed it.  It explains economics in easy to understand language but is detailed as well.  I highly recommend this as a step into the world of economics.
B0019EXZYE|4.0|THE BANK JOB is almost one of those guy action flicks that we blokes just love to beat our chests about. Seeing Jason Statham ([[ASIN:B000KHX73U Crank]]) as the main character certainly added to this assumption since he's a guy's guy when it comes to action films of late. Known mostly for his martial arts moves in [[ASIN:B000FKO3WG The Transporter]] series, Statham has become synonymous with the tough guy image. And although The Bank Job has elements of Statham's toughness, it's not what makes this movie a very good flick to spend 111 minutes watching.<br /><br />Most interesting is that the film is based on an actual London crime where a group of lowly criminals decide to move up to the big time by robbing a bank. Trouble is, it's all a ruse to get at some photos that the British government wants but can't get to. So MI-6 hires out the job ...supposedly without the knowledge of The Crown or the higher-ups in the legal system.<br /><br />Terry Leather (Statham) is the unlucky soul who gets roped into doing the job by one-time flame Martine Love (Saffron Burrows, [[ASIN:B000NY0YKO Fay Grim]]), an extremely attractive woman who's got an inside scoop on said banks security system shut down. When Terry and his crew finally do get inside and begin rifling through the contents of safety deposit boxes, they all think they're in hog-heaven. But once finished with the job, Britains elite to its scumbags come crawling around, looking for who stole their belongings, records, photos, and other miscellaneous items. Terry's team is in for some rough times. But can Terry get most of them out of it before it's too late?<br /><br />Although no one really knows what happened to the bank robbers (other than they were probably jailed under assumed names), it is interesting to look at the history behind the robbery and see how involved England's legal system was in everything after the heist. None of the names of the criminals was ever released. Nor were their sentences. Nothing of their identities has ever been seen by the public, even though this was a public crime perpetrated against a public entity (a bank).<br /><br />There's a lot going on in the story, too, so it's pretty convoluted but the story holds together exceptionally well. Director Roger Donaldson ([[ASIN:B000MX7V3Y The World's Fastest Indian]]) is to be commended for that; this thing could've got completely unwieldy, I'm sure.<br /><br />Statham carries the film well on dramatic chops and not his normal action/martial arts ones. His overwhelming affection for his wife (Keeley Hawes, [[ASIN:B001O2MBP0 Death at a Funeral]]) is portrayed with just the right amount of tenderness and tough-love. His caring for his team is also well played, especially when they begin to disappear in not-so-pleasant ways.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a very well put together flick, with just the right doses of action and drama to make one enjoy every minute of it.been seen by the public, even though this was a public crime perpetrated against a public entity (a bank).

B0012GMW0C|5.0|I saw someone who said they only own the first four Journey albums.  I owned the first four only briefly. That was until \\"Infinity\\" received the door test, which was shortly after buying it and attempting to listen to it.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the door test, you take the album (vinyl) or you can do it with a CD.  Hold it next to the door frame so that approximately half the album or CD projects into the open doorway. Then slam the door on it as hard as you can. If it survives, it's worth keeping. If it doesn't, well... that's what happened to \\"Infinity\\", and I never bought another Journey album after that.  I still own the first three.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Iron Man is a great movie! Buy the DVD! Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark. Terrance Howard Plays Jim Rhodes. Jeff Bridges plays the Iron Man's nemesis, Iron Monger.

1401219268|4.0|I decided to purchase Watchmen finally after hearing all the hype over the movie and reading other reviews about the book online.  I was impressed with the story from the start.<br />I could not put it down. I powered through it in two nights time!<br />I then went and saw the movie.  It was surprisingly close to the novel, with some obvious differences and omissions, but overall a throughly enjoyable film.<br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I felt the ending of the book was a bit forced and hurried.<br />This is still an  excellent read and I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of comics and graphic novels.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wall-E is one of those rare movies, where everything goes right. And this DVD is brilliant. Thanks for sending it to me as promised, mint in package!
0060920084|5.0|If you are an idealist, this book is not for you.    However, if you dont see the world through rose-colored glasses, lack the American trait of calling a turd a flower, and have a sharp sense of humor this is the best book you will ever read.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|An interesting tale of training, fighting and survival that is needlessly interspersed with adolescent diatribes against \\"liberals...liberal media...the ACLU\\" and the like, which nearly got me to stop reading before reaching the best parts.  The training portion is too long and burdened by heavy doses of testosterone.  The book also suffers from very poor editing.  I would offer criticism of what I found to be excessive SEAL jingoism, but having not served in the armed forces, I'll leave that to the other reviewers who have.
0393061310|4.0|I thought this was one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time.  Jared Diamond does an absolutely amazing job and goes into great detail to explaining the progress of mankind and how much geography played in shaping our world today.  I would have to say that was the most profound piece of information for me - the impact of geography.  I had always thought the study of geography was just maps and globes but Mr. Diamond shows us just how important location can be in the development of civilizations.  I guess it's true...location, location, location!
1416562605|5.0|\\"White Tiger\\" is rich and colorful. Reading it is total immersion in Indian culture, straight off the high dive into the deep water. You soak in the details--the ooze, the muck, the politics and cultural tics of India. But, two cautions. First, there isn't much tension. Second, the theme isn't subtle; it pops up at every turn. The main character is a taxi driver so there are many turns. \\"The dreams of the rich and the dreams of the poor--they never overlap, do they?\\" asks Balram Halwai.<br /><br />The ending is not only foreshadowed, it's spelled out in detail long before it happens. But enough of the cautions. The book works because of powerful, low-grade seething that Adiga brings to Halwai's point of view. At times biting and at times perplexed, Halwai has analyzed his position in the world system, or at least in India, and has developed a razor-sharp justification for his actions. \\"My way of living is all wrong but I don't have the courage to change it,\\" he proclaims somewhat matter-of-factly.<br /><br />The details of \\"White Tiger\\" are wonderful. The half-ripe guavas, water buffalo lore, Indian income taxes, face masks, air pollution, roaches, skin diseases, social hierarchy, imported wine, liquor casts, traffic, \\"Murder Weekly,\\" footwear, burning cellophane, curries, urban growth, traffic, \\"the great Indian rooster coop,\\" blonde prostitutes, the perfect driver, dye jobs, red puddles of spit, fortune machines, poems and poetry, stray dogs, zoos, Johnny Walker Black, geckos.<br /><br />\\"White Tiger\\" is about being caged, about being stuck in the station of life to which you were born. It's about \\"what it means not to be a servant\\" and all the opportunity that making such a change could bring. This is an amazing book--a delicious moral tale in a rich and powerful setting (in more ways than one).
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I saw this film on DVD -- as I do most movies these days -- was very interested in seeing it after it won so many awards. It was an extraordinary experience. It's very hard to watch in places -- but it is remarkable film -- heartbreaking. horrifying, beautiful. The young actors are extraordinary. And I can understand why the people of India initially disliked the film, then were thrilled when it was recognized for being the -- yes, masterpiece -- that it is. For better or worse, I'm very much a \\"Westerner\\" -- Scots-Irish, English -- and India, while a fascinating country, I'm sure, seems to be one of such extremes -- from poverty to wealth, that -- well, let's just say it's not a country I've wanted to visit -- and I'm still not sure -- assuming I could -- would want to. But it certainly gave me another perspective, one I'm glad to have. Bravo to Danny Boyle, the cast, everyone. This is a fine -- and brave --  piece of work.
B00008LDPU|3.0|I can't believe I just watched the whole DVD for the first time after all these years... The animations are generally pretty visceral, and they are entertaining in that respect.  Perhaps inevitably, this leads to some potentially disturbing images.  Nothing too gruesome, and the artistry in some of the CG segments more than make up for it.  The Last Flight of the Osiris is a particularly pleasing sensual experience.    Unfortunately, the intellectual aspect of Animatrix is no better than the movies themselves, which is sorely wanting.  Two of its showpieces, The Second Renaissance I and II, are maddeningly ludicrous.  Nevermind the fact that liquefied human flesh cannot supply new useful energy to sustain new human bodies, except ultimately as a source of raw matter in E = mc^2.  Nevermind the logical impossibility of a machine race that simultaneously possesses a singular (in the words of Morpheus himself) and individual consciousness (as evident by varying machine behavior in the anime).  The portrayal of humans in these animes are downright insulting.  It is as though the people of the future, who can build a race of servile robots and devise a plan as diabolical as blocking out the sun, lack the basic foresight to form a useful plan against a city-state of machines, that stayed friendly and peaceful to let humans initiate a thousand-warhead nuclear bombardment.  It seems a school of adolescents can come up with more creative and more useful plans.    As a result, I find the Animatrix to be all in good fun as long as I watch it as a piece of visual art to be enjoyed.  However, as with many works of art, trying to dig too deeply, too intellectually, one digs a hole so deep that Plato could not climb out.  Be like Smith.  Have fun; don't be so serious.  You may need to remind young, impressionable watchers this point.
B00123BCKQ|4.0|The Scottish John Mayer-he is absolutely brilliant. Didn't discover him until Jade's funeral today. He is truly talented. \\"Loving You\\" reminds me of Lenny Kravtz's first album. I cannot wait to share this with friends.
B0000C6K09|2.0|The music on this album is a mixture of re-recordings that possibly are from the original musical scores of their respective movies, but the music most definitely is NOT the soundtrack music of the respective movies as Amazon advertises.  There can be one and only one musical soundtrack for a movie and the music from this album is admittedly re-recordings.  If you want to buy the original soundtrack music for each of the described movies, this album does not have any of it.  Come on Amazon, get your act together!
1416914307|4.0|The last in the trilogy, and the best of the three; the 'City of Glass' is on fire. The characters leave us with much more depth than when the series started.  Clary and Jace will probably be in my head for days to come.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away that may ruin the experience for you, suffice it to say if you've read the first two, you likely won't be disappointed in the finale, which is richer and deeper than the previous two.<br /><br />If you're a stickler for fine editing, you may get a bit distracted in a couple of places, but I found them easily overlooked as the plot had grabbed my full attention.
1580084621|5.0|After hearing about this book on The Splendid Table, I bought it for my husband for his birthday about 3 weeks ago and he's already made a bunch of different meals out if it. The recipes include a lot of ingredients but they aren't too complicated. We found an awesome Asian grocer near our house and have become regulars there. I definitely recommend this book if you are interested in authentic Thai cooking.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|The movie was received a little later than I expected, but it was worth it, the movie was new!
0743277708|5.0|Adams succeeds in every possible way with this beloved classic of English literature. Not only is the plot-line gripping and intense but his characterization of the animals is among the finest feats in modern. My mother read this book to me early in grade school as a means to get me interested in reading. 400 books later, I think she made the right choice. Buy and inspire someone to delve into literature, yourself included! This book is a constant reminder of why we read books to begin with.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Coming right off of [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale [Blu-ray]]], Quantum of Solace draws from the more modern era of spy films such as [[ASIN:B001LPWGE6 The Bourne Trilogy (The Bourne Identity   The Bourne Supremacy   The Bourne Ultimatum) [Blu-ray]]], by going for tightly shot, tightly plotted and low gadget stories.    The second film with Daniel Craig, his Bond may be the closest to the one created by Sir Ian Flemming, with his not-quite-conventionally lovely face and brutal brawler aspect to him.  We see the evolution of Bond from man driven towards brutal revenge to a man driven to total revenge by crawling up the ladder of enemies.  Also, the new overarching plot of the new Bond-the existence, nature, and goals of the mysterious group called Quantum-is elaborated here.    A superbly done film, and superbly shot.  It has the Bond trademark of going to unique places, and is as much travelogue as action film.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|The version I saw gave you a choice between wide or full screen on the menu.    In a way, there were similarities that may have been borrowed from the Lonesome Dove pair, Gus and Captain Call.  Two taciturn men, of basic good character (mostly), teaming up to become lawmen after discovering a lot about each other to the point they knew they could count on it when chips were down; the uncontrollable rage that Virgil flew into when angered, being stopped by the other.    But is was a good story in its own right.  Virgil Cole, played by Ed Harris and Everett Hitch, portrayed by Viggo Mortensen, bounced well off of each others development of their characters.  The two ride into the town southwest town of Appaloosa on invitation to clean it up by the city fathers.  The contracts are brought out and hastily put asunder by the committee, as the two already have their own drawn up and very simple:  they do things their own way or they don't do them at all.  That includes no laws for the lawmen to follow as they sort out the details of the population,  and the balance of the laws for the public to follow are simple enough for even the toughest renegade to understand:  do it wrong and you're dead.  After they are there awhile, they discover that a varmint by the name of Randall Bragg, played slickly by Jeremy Irons, has killed another lawman they had known - and the plot thickens, stirred seductively by Renee Zellweger as she tries, but fails miserably in the attempt to set up a love triangle and drive a wedge between the two.  The resulting conversation that settles THAT situation once and for all is also good for a laugh.    All in all, the story was interesting and entertaining and I enjoyed the trip with them.  The stilted cautious conversation that sprung up between Virgil and the newcomer girl (Renee Zellweger) who kept making sure they understood she wasn't a whore started off the unusual meeting between the three of them in the hotel dining room, and exacerbated fromthere.    The scenery and photography amounts to one of the best parts of any movie for me, especially in a Western, and this film has a lot going for it in that department; splendid vistas.  It's a good movie for those of us who enjoy our villains getting shot one at a time rather than being blown up by the thousands in \\"special effects\\" explosions
B001TODCII|5.0|The setup in concept and execution is brilliant.  Even the trailer made not apologies about the type of movie it was going to be.  Someone takes Bryan's (Neeson) little girl Kim (Grace), but doesn't realize he is a very dangerous man capable of some serious damage when provoked.  The rest of a movie is a chase to find Kim, where Bryan uses his vast array of skills acquired as a former FBI agent to track down the evil criminals involved in her abduction.<br /><br />Before allowing Kim to go on vacation to Paris with a friend, Bryan insists on precaution.  He's hesitant in the first place, denying her initial request; however, he eventually relents but with a few requirements.  Kim gets a cell phone and must stay in constant contact with her father.  Off she goes to Europe away from daddy's protection.  Within a single day, but not too quickly, his daughter calls her father.  While on the phone she sees her friend get kidnapped, and her father lets her know she is also going to be taken.  Dad is not pleased, informs the bad guy as much, and the bad guy's reply, \\"Good luck.\\"  The hunt is on.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, get in Bryan's way and you'll be punished.  If he has time, and you pose a particularly burdensome obstacle, you may even die.  For the most part he drops various bad guys with single head shots.  Other than Captain Kirk's infamous neck chop, there has not been such one-punch precision in the history of combat.  Every criminal element involved is essentially a punching bag, rag doll waiting for the coup de grace.<br /><br />Will he get to his daughter in time?  The power of this movie is the suspense, not knowing if he'll make it in time to save Kim from danger, or if he'll find her at all.  Great action movie, something that goes from zero to sixty in no time at all, and never takes pressure off the throttle.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout. I've only done the first session and look forward to advancing soon.  I sweat and feel energized afterwards.  I read the other reviews and decided that I would do the first session a few times before moving on.  Jillian is very motivating.  YOU DON'T GET NOTHING FOR FREE PEOPLE!
B00005JKES|1.0|I received this item as a gift and was shocked to discover that \\"episode 1\\" is not the pilot. This is an amazing series, and I was looking forward to enjoying it all over again, but it looks like I'll have to shell out $75 for the gold edition if I want to see the pilot. I guess I can make some kind of DVD sculpture out of these 4 disks.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|CHris Cornells latest foray into music can only be described as boring. If you are a fan of Audioslave or Soundgarden you will be disappointed. If you are a fan of Brittany Spears, Timbaland or Justin Timberlake this might be the CD for you. He may be looking to expand the types of music he performs but this one misses the mark. I can only hope his next CD will look back to his rock and roll roots. My opinion, save your money.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|I won't delve into the plot, acting, scenery, editing and everything else that constitutes a movie. Plenty other reviewers do that. This movie didn't have to be believable (the grad student who knows little Spanish and spends no time in the library) or particularly witty (wow, did a character actually use the phrase \\"turgid argument about the categorical imperative\\"?)....I was just irritated that every character sounded like Woody Allen! Whiney, self-absorbed, quick to moralize about everything objectionable....could the man get out in the real world and listen to how other people talk? Heck, even reading a book by Richard Price might help him....
B00127RAJY|4.0|These three work-outs are harder than they look.  The only thing that bothers me is that you can't skip Jillian's intro to the program everytime you use it.  On my P90X DVDs I can skip right to the work-out.  Jillian definitely rocks.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|Ms. Krall sounds awfully sleepy on this disc. She's singing in a very lazy style, as if she awoke from 2 hours sleep and was dragged into the studio to record these songs against her will. Her quartet sounds great though. This makes for nice dinner music..to be played very low during the main course.    The video is beautiful for 'quiet nights' though. Is that Brazil?

Oh, and by legacy code I'm talking about that code your wrote this morning.
0800141628|5.0|I'm a baby-boomer that has seen and enjoyed this movie many times. I have read a number of reviews complaining about the profanity of the four boys. I lived for over 20 years across the street from a grade school and, believe me, boys that age (and even younger) DO enjoy tossing profanity around when teachers or adults aren't around, and many of them are quite adept at smoking cigarettes, too. (In this day and age, little girls are just as likely to do so.) Back in the 50's, though, I can't recall hearing boys or girls using the f-bomb as these kids did in the movie. That word didn't gain popularity until later...Just an observation.

B001PPF12G|3.0|As a die hard Radiohead fan, it pains me to see a collector's edition not go the full mile. Now the album itself is a genuine classic and deserves it's place among the great classics of our time. That said, where is the remastered edition (not remixed) that would have been worth it's weight in gold? I mean has anyone heard the re-release of Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\"?! It's incredible! It would have been a true reason to release this as opposed to EMI cashing in on their white knight that has left them behind.     Also, the b-sides... now believe me, they are amazing (outside of maybe a couple of bad seeds). But they are also on itunes for 99 cents each! What's crazy is that the OK Computer set is more half a**ed than this one with lame postcards and a third disc of 3 or 4 music videos!     In the end, I love the band. I feel everything they put out is solid, but this is a lazy attempt at a quick buck EMI... and $35 at that! Twenty bucks maybe but really?!! I guess now that this is out we won't see what really could have been. I give this 3 Stars because it is Radiohead after all and I know they didn't approve this package. They are better to their fans than EMI ever cares to be.
0240810961|5.0|The first volume of DRAWN TO LIFE covers mainly basic gesture drawing, while the second volume explores how to 'push' the action and create distinct personalities in gesture sketches. These two books are a wonderful addition to the library of animation.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is a movie for everyone.  It is fantastic music combined with the animation and imagination of Disney. I personally liked the Classical music.  Since the cutting of musical programs in schools, this is good exposure to the classics for children (and the whole family.)  The narration between pieces of music is really good.  It is informative and entertaining.  This movie should not be missed.  It is educational, entertaining, and extremely artistic.

B001VWBFTG|4.0|I was not much of a Coldplay fan before this album. I had bought A Rush of Blood to the Head, and liked it, but Coldplay was never one of my favorites.  I heard a soundbite of Viva la Vida on TV, and had to buy the album, after listening to it three times, I was hooked. Each song just made me feel good, and the lyrics stand alone, as does the melody. Brian Eno really is a great producer, and that added with the talent of this band are awesome.
0452289963|5.0|Hi,this book 'The New Earth' by Eckhart Tolle is one of the most profound excellent books that I have read to date. It should be in every library available for all to read. The writings of Eckhart Tolle are so easy to read and digest and gives us all food for thought. I feel it has changed my consciousness already and given me more insight as to the constant mind chatter, and made me realize more clearly about Being in the Now. I would give this book a ten star rating not just a five.     Cheryl  Australia
0694003611|5.0|My daughter is 20 months old, she has to take this book to bed with her EVERY night.     We always read it before bed, at night or at nap time. Its become our favorite story, hands down. I highly recommend this book, i loved it as a child myself and I've rediscovered it through her eyes again.     The flow of the words, the illustrations, even the way in which the room becomes darker and darker from page to page... it all prepares your little one for a good nights rest. It leaves you with such a warm calm feeling. On the last page, Sophie always points out that the \\"bunny seepin' ..sssshhh ni nite.\\"     Your child's bedtime story collection isn't complete without this book!!!
0316168815|5.0|At first this book is very unsettling. Having young children myself the heinous murder of a child-I am not giving anything away here- affected me deeply. The story reaffirms the fragile nature of life and the enormous consequences a loss of life has on family and friends. What started as a tragic tale transformed into one of love and redemption sweetly told by the victim, Susie Salmon. The book was not perfect.There were a couple of sequences near the end that seemed unnecessary or too contrived-I would be giving too much away here to expound.  I gave it 5 stars because the book was unusual, thought provoking and it captured my interest from beginning to end. Read it. And love your children.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this mobile based upon the reviews others have left. I have to agree that it is a very nice mobile.  It was easy to put together and runs a long time on the batteries. However, I don't use it to put my little guy to sleep. I use it as an entertainment diversion so I can take a shower or spend a few minutes doing stuff around the house.  It keeps him fully engaged the whole 15-20 minutes that I am busy.  The only drawback is the music - I wish the music choices were a little better.  I like the volume setting of high and low and the remote control.
0385340990|5.0|I loved this book!  Everyone that I've passed it on to has felt the same.  In fact, my friends and I now have our own Potato Peel Pie Literary Society.

B0002MB7QW|5.0|I have watched this movie several times on TV and it never fails to enthrall and frighten me with the awesome possibilities of Nature's forces.I would take the message of our careless abuse of natural resources to heart and since we create the problem of pollution we can find a solution( or several ) to improve the quality of the air we breath and share with all living creatures.Nature can't be controlled completely but we can learn to cooperate as a global community.And just like peace it begins with each of us.    The prospects of another ice-age followed by or preceeding global flooding  is very possible as we all are familiar with the story of Noah's flood and many ancient cultures mention the flood which gave birth to new life.  The message in this movie should not be taken lightly we do need to take better care of our environment.    As we approach Earth's completed cycle of its 11,000 year journey(the Mayan calendar was interpreted as approximately 25,000 years) and it reaches the position in the center of our galaxy (culminating around the first day of Winter 2012) our planet will wobble and more than likely more volcanoes will erupt and climate change will occur that includes the global flooding mentioned in Noah's day(Old Testament of the Bible) just as it's doing now.The Earth is billions of years old but extinction of any species is always possible.Humans survived the last ice-age and global flooding we can survive again as long as we know what is happening---just don't panic.    I found this movie to be an edge of the seat thriller packed with alot of unsettling more than possible real life special effects.Frozen air can destroy machinery and life forms can be flash frozen.The delicate balance of ocean currents can affect air flow masses and there is always the possibilities of superhurricanes,catogory 5 plus tornadoes combining together and tidal waves created by storm surges.These are happening at this time.And I will  mention the fact the poles keepour atmosphere cooler and if they do melt all at once  as Earth heats up ,the water rises and then begins to create steam and a jungle (greenhouse) effect.The temperatures and humidity would reach unbearable proportions for most life forms.    As far as the dialogue is concerened it is appropriate for the movie,kept it going and being concerned about family members,community and the need for survival is very human.I don't believe I have ever watched a scarier movie than this one whose only monster is the uncontrollable violent forces of Nature fighting to survive and the good Earth----our only home in this universe) conquors all.    I give the movie 5 stars for excellence in getting a difficult message across as a warning about the effects of global changes.What took earth billions of years to create and evolve in many life forms as flora and fauna humankind has managed to affect with our pollution of perhaps a century that can very likely bring about our demise.Take it seriously..it's happened in the Earth's past.
B001N18HOQ|5.0|I am a huge Pearl Jam fan, and Ten is by far my favorite album.  I will let you know that I will continue to play the same disc that my dad bought in 1991 until the thing disintegrates.  That being said...    the Redux version of Ten is awesome.  For the diehard fans: fear not, none of the soul of the original is lost with this album.  I know some people think that remixing or fixing an album after its original release is sacrilege, but I don't subscribe to that belief.  What Brendan O'Brien did was not create a new album, not even close.  He sharpened up the sound, brought out more of Eddie on the songs, and made all the tracks come at you with a louder bang than ever before.  I love the redux version, and I still have to listen to it another 100 or so times to come even with my listens to the original.  If you're a true PJ fan, you should be getting this anyway, but even if you're only a casual fan (or new altogether), I think this version is well worth the investment, as it brings the same vibe from the 1991 songs to a newer, updated, fresher platform in the Redux version.    As for the DVD, yeah, it only has a few songs and doesn't provide the entire show, but let's be honest: they picked some great songs, the picture quality is pretty good, and the audio is very good.  I think of it as a bonus, as it only adds to the entire package.  If you don't think it's worth the extra money to get the DVD with 7 songs, then just get the Collector's Edition with the 2 cd's.  however, I think it's worth the extra few bucks, as nothing beats Pearl Jam live.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|The collector's edition of McClintock is great. The audio and the picture are very high quality and the movie is always a family favorite.
B001G1ACVY|5.0|Owning this is essential for any Mraz fan. I purchased the CD by itself when it first came out and ended up buying this through the recommendation of Amazon along with the \\"Tonight, Not Again\\" CD/DVD and was so glad I did! The EPs are awesome and very personal. I love Jason even more when he goes all acoustic on us. The DVD is a concert that includes all my favorite songs. He surprised me with his Spanish intro to \\"Not So Usual\\" but that's just what he does so well---mixes things up and delivers something fresh and beautiful every time. LOVED this. LOVE Jason!
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|I rented this movie not knowing it was directed by Woody Allen.  I will from now on make sure I look at who directed the movies I get.  This is an extremely tedious slow moving movie as in the usual style of WA's movies.  Painful to watch and listen to, never never never again, if I could have given it a -1 star I sure would have.  The only thing that could have made this movie suck anymore would be to have WA's voice over or staring in it himself.
0646497855|5.0|It is really a great book. You can undrestand it very easly and improve your reading and writing in a very little time. Speaking and Listening are good as well.    I red many books and nothing was helpfull to me like this book. This book helped me to have a great vision about the examination in really short time(one week). It helped me to undrestand how can I pick up the main information in Reading and analizing different kind of questions, not only that but there are clear and  simple examples in that part as well.     I learned how to manage my time for the real examination.  As I had not that much time to prepare for the exam,This book \\"Tagret band 7\\" it was the most helpful and undrestandable book I ever had to prepare for the exam.   It Teached me how I can manage the time in the real exam and  what I should-shouldn't do.   It is very practical, I have managed to improve my writing skills by exercising the tips with the writing technique,and  also there is useful technic for various kind of reports and charts.     Go for it and improve your band score.
B001M4YZ90|3.0|This deal is kinda weak compared to his two first films. They were new and fresh and fun. Now it's turning into a same-o same-o formula. There is a quick middle distance shot of Thandie Newton dancing that was quite mesmerizing. This thin soup left me hungry.

0385338082|4.0|This was a fun, light, quick read.  No, it will not ever qualify as great literature but it was a well-written, laugh-out-loud kind of book.  It is a romance more believable than \\"Pretty Woman\\" but somewhat fantastical compared to real life.  Its charm is in the main character's  self-deprecating humor.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I don't know how they proliferate some of this stuff but it's just amazing, some of the best audio artwork laid to tape... not to mention Brent has clearly taken the reigns, which is good I suppose as the mans a creative genius with the guitar. I will admit that after \\"Blood Mountain\\" I was a little over the \\"neo-prog\\" thing.... I can't stand Mars Volta and they were getting a little close to going that route... \\"blood mountain\\" had it's moments, and the musicianship is always mind blowing, but, as with many of you, \\"Leviathan\\" will always be the album that got me to REALLY listen to them, as it is one of the top metal albums I have ever heard... so on that note, bm just didn't flow, or hit me rather, the way leviathan did... Crack the skye is an album you can just tell they poured their hearts and souls into and didn't think twice or hold back... and reading some of the articles in mags like Drum! and Revolver, I found out just how much of their personal lives went into this record, kind of affected the way I listened to it as well, there were quite a few things I found out when it comes to the blood, sweat and beers of rock and roll for this band that I have grown to admire and be very musically inspired by over the years... I saw a reference to this hitting like the first listen of TOOL \\"Aenema\\" and I was thinking the exact same thing today... not quite, but close... that and TOOL got me first... that album changed my life and the way perceived music forever, maybe this album could do the same for the right set of ears and a young open mind.

B00008MZ0N|4.0|The summer of 2001 was chock full of great movies for audiences to feast their eyes upon. Within that assortment of entertainment there was one film that stepped out of the shadows of obscurity to become one of the biggest surprise hits of the year. That film is the adrenaline-fueled thrill ride known as \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" starring Vin Diesel (\\"A Man Apart\\") and Paul Walker (\\"Varsity Blues\\"), and directed by successful action director Rob Cohen (\\"xXx\\").    On the streets of Los Angeles, in the world of street racing, there is only one question you must answer to in order to win the day: Are you faster than all other contenders standing next to you? For undercover LAPD officer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), that question is one that he is determined to answer at any cost by taking down the one man that rules the street racing life, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel). However, can Brian remain loyal to his brothers in blue while at the same time becoming immersed into this fast-paced world of cars, money, and women?    My initial reaction when I saw the first trailers for this film was one of indifference. Based on the trailer the film seemed to be just an endless supply of racing sequences, close-ups of cars, women, and so on and so forth, with not much of anything else really holding the experience together. While each of those items I mentioned are on display in this film (and I'm not complaining about that in the least), there also happens to be plenty of story to tie it all together in a very cohesive fashion that I found surprising for a movie like this.    The story, written by Gary Scott Thompson (\\"Hollow Man\\"), Erik Bergquist, and David Ayer (\\"Training Day\\"), is a non-stop ride filled with intense racing, character development (surprisingly enough), drama, and even a little bit of romance. I thought it was wise for the writers to take the time to actually build-up relationships between the characters, especially the two leads. Thus allowing the audience to get to know them and relate to them, so that even when they do things that we know isn't completely legal, we still side with them due to our connection. The inclusion of the theme of loyalty was also a very nice touch and in the end was the overall theme for the entire film. Many times a film's theme(s) are beaten endlessly into the audience so that they don't miss the main message of the film; however, in this instance the question of loyalty amongst the film's characters is handled in a much more realistic fashion. Only a few instances is it really touched upon in an overt way, and rarely does it feel forced into the storyline as a way to catch up those audience members that might not be comprehending the underlying theme. For a film that at first glance appeared to be a brainless actioner for the adrenaline junkies, the well-developed storyline really took me on a much more enjoyable ride than I initially thought possible.    For a movie like this to succeed several key factors must fall into place, among them it must have the combined talents of stunt drivers, computer wizards, and of course a director accustomed to action films to hold it all together. The stunt drivers in this film have got to be without a doubt some of the best in the business, if not the very best. The tricks they achieve are truly stunning, and sure some of them benefited from CGI enhancement, but even with that assistance there was plenty of realism involved to serve as the basis for the technical wizards to draw upon. As for director Rob Cohen, he tends to be one of those directors that creates very entertaining movies for the general public, but finds himself maligned by most critics. With \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" I believe that Rob has actually crafted what could be his best and most comprehensive movie to date, and as a person that has enjoyed many of his films, it's a shame he's not more appreciated by most film critics.    And finally, we cannot forget the cast of talented up-and-comers that brought these characters to life. Portraying the film's two leads are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. Another part of why this film found bigger success than was expected (at least in my opinion) is due to the brotherly type of relationship between Dominic and Brian that develops over the course of the film. Had their scenes not felt so realistic and natural, this movie would have fallen apart at the seams in an instant.    Regarding the actors individual performances let's start off with Vin Diesel. For the majority of Vin's work he ends up criticized for being a one-note performance type of actor, which normally means he's best suited for the action genre; however, in this film there are a couple of times where he lets down the machismo armor and allows a gentler side come to the fore. It's in these times, and in other films he's done (i.e. \\"A Man Apart\\" or \\"Find Me Guilty\\"), where Vin shows that there is more depth to him than most critics give him credit for. As for Paul Walker, I typically find him to be a decent actor, albeit with a little too much laid back, surfer dude quality imbued within every performance he gives. However, for this film, it is that very quality that seems to make him an ideal choice to play the character of Brian O'Connor. And for the most part, his performance in this movie is actually quite good, only a couple of instances he seemed like he rushed some lines or was a bit stiff, overall it was one of the stronger performances in his career.    Supporting the two leads are actresses Michelle Rodriguez (\\"Resident Evil\\") and Jordana Brewster (\\"Annapolis\\"). Both actresses do well with their respective roles; although, for me personally I would have preferred a little more work had been put into developing Jordana's character a bit further. It seemed that her character was essentially there for two reasons, to serve as the catalyst for getting Brian mixed up with Dominic's crew, and secondly, to be Brian's love interest so that all the ladies in the audience would have a little bit of romance to enjoy. Jordana's character of Mia seemed like she could have been a more interesting character given the opportunity, but I guess the writers just didn't really know what all to do with her. As for Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), she was a different kind of character than I expected, because in essence she was just a female version of Dominic. Just like Mia, Michelle's character was mostly used as a love interest and strong female character for the ladies to relate to. Unlike Mia though, I didn't really find Letty to be all that interesting and worthy of receiving any further screen time, especially since most of her background was summed up in a matter of sentences and beyond that I didn't feel any further exposition was warranted.    \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" was not only a surprise hit at the box office, but also a surprise for me as well. As I stated before, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the movie, but upon watching it I found that I was sorely mistaken in that assumption, and extremely entertained at the same time. This film is definitely a lot of fun, especially for car guys, but even if you're not, there is plenty in this film to keep you entertained and in my opinion leave you wanting more.    \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.
B0013D69YE|1.0|I was actually at home a few weeks ago, and discovered I bought this cd when I was a freshman in HS. I was like why would I buy that? I remembered I bought the cd because I used to be a huge Destiny's Child fan when i was a kid,but then I got older.Then i remembered thinking in the walmart cd section,well if i liked destiny's child years earlier then this cd might be good. To be quite honest. I thought Crazy in love, the video had a good look to it. The song sucked. Baby Boy was stupid. Pure crap to me, and very annoying. I actually thought her cover of Donna Summer's Love to Love you Baby was ok.(Naughty GirL). Me Myself and I was decent, but same old same old. I really just got to tired of Beyonce's sound at that point. It was to overplayed and not that good. Her duet with Luther Vandross was classy and He's a legend. It was good(the duet), but it wasn't worth paying almost 20 bucks at the time(remember this is when cd's were trying to justify their high prices). If your a huge Beyonce Fan this get this album. Personally, i thought it was too safe and not gritty enough. I liked her recent release way better.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I've been listening to this CD nonstop since getting it.  I just LOVE it!  It's an uplifting CD with beautiful music.  It's definitely a must for any music lover out there!  Keith has outdone himself!
B000WXVJ6Y|5.0|I remember this album practically took everybody by storm, and then when she performed on American Idol, I knew she was going to be around for a while. I like her solo work as good as her work with No Doubt. Because let's face it. She is the voice singing on all of No Doubt's stuff. Over the years, she's dramatically changed her image. I remember when she was considered only alternative and then No Doubt got huge and became pop. Then she said she wanted to do rap. I was like wtf? I wasn't a big fan of her 1st album, but this one outdoes it by a long shot. All the singles were huge when they came out, the look was cool, the production was very slick. I liked everything about this cd. It had to be one of my favorite to come out during that year. Wind it Up, The Sweet Escape, Now that you've got it. I mean all of the tracks were awesome. And the cd had a few more tracks that were better. Fluorescent and Break Up were two excellent songs, and they could have been huge hits. To me this is a great followup, so to speak, to Nelly Furtado's Loose. If you love that CD then your really going to love this one. A lot of people said Madonna was supposed to do a similiar album, but to me this one was far superior.
B001HZ9ABM|3.0|Odessa, The Bee Gees' answer to The Beatles' White Album, has some fine tracks to be sure, but overall it's a ponderous, pretentious album that is difficult to listen to from beginning to end. I find myself skipping over tracks to get to the ones I like, such as 'Melody Fair' and 'Lamplight'. 'Marley Purt Drive' I like less now, since it veers off into country-pop, which is not a direction the Bee Gees should have gone into. Again, good tracks here and there but too much orchestration and slightly less appealing tunes that those found on their first 3 albums.
0316067601|5.0|I've read and/or listened to thousands of books. Rarely do I find a book that I can't put down once I start reading it. This book is one of them. I have a whole new respect for the special forces and some attributes that all of the men and women have to have... conscience, courage, faith, trust, respect and dignity for the individual. I've recommended this book to many friend and the ones who have read it give it raves, too. Richard
B0012GN0FI|5.0|wow, can these guys lay it down or what?! In my book easily one of the best metal bands ever. Wolf Hoffman has created some of the best riffs in metal and he's one helluva guitar player. Udo Dirkschneider's vocals are an acquired taste and when I first got into this band I didn't care much for his vocals but he's the right man for this band. His vocals are as aggressive as the music.<br />A lot of Accept's classics are here making this a must-have live CD. Sure, there are a lot of metal bands out there but Accept has been doing this for a long time and what separates them from the pack are the songs. Great writing! I Highly recommend this disc to any fan of quality metal. Balls to the wall baby!<br />[...]
B0008ENICU|5.0|What is there to say you have Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell and a cast of many fine actors in a funny, whitty movie about relationships and the ups and downs of marriage, divorce and remarriage. Highly recommend this to everyone who loves the classics and just seeing a great cast of actors shine.
B001EO2UKO|1.0|Please do not buy this album. It is the most boring CD I have ever heard. I LOVED Dido's previous albums, all songs were great. They were full of feeling, interesting ambiences and a wonderful voice. In \\"Safe Trip Home\\" Dido seems absent and bored... Many said it is because her father's death affected her, but it would have been great to listen to her voice expressing such deep grief. I played this CD once and I don't think I will ever play it again. Not a single track is worth it. I hope she amends this huge mistake in her career before people start to forget how good she used to be...
B001PPGAIA|5.0|While the subject matter was a tough one, tho true, I still loved the movie.  I really fell in love with the little boy played by Brandon Walters.  I do hope to see him in more movies in the future.  What a charmer he is!
B0002KQNL8|4.0|I'm not going describe the movie plot, for its been already told. I've seen so many negative reviews regarding the music score. I agree that it's ashame to damper with a classic. But my understanding is Warner had no choice. Even with the different music it's still a great movie to own. The FX alone is worth the price. I've been a horror fan for years. I'm glad to see this on dvd. I have said this before stop your complaining. Take what you can get. Serous! the changed music score is not that big of a difference .
B000PFU7OO|5.0|After having seen the movie, it was an obvious next step to investigate the soundtrack. I recommend both! These artists have talent that is not mainstream but unique and inspiring. Listening to the tracks caused me to investigate next - Interference. one thing leads to another.  you won't be disappointed, but i recommend viewing the dvd first. stick with it, the beginning is not as strong as the meat of the story. it comes to you.

B0015DYIH2|1.0|This was the most unfortunately and foolishly published book I have ever read. It was the most disgustingly idiotic combination of lust and blood sucking monsters in the world. It made me feel almost nauseous, and I could hardly read on. It was poorly written, the plotline was repetitive from the other books in the series, and it was totally uncreative and gross.
B00028HBKM|5.0|No kidding, this movie changed my life. In all my years I never really got it until this movie. Being a visual person, seeing THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST made me realize what not only God/Jesus went through but Mary as well. A mother myself, know no matter what I go through with my kids, it can't compare to what Mary had to endure, seeing her son go through what He did. And He was innocent.<br /><br />This movie and reading \\"The Purpose Drive Life\\", catapulted me into a Christ Centered Christian. I now fully live my life for Him. I live to seek out and live out my passions that God has given me. There's nothing like a life serving others in His name.<br /><br />I'm the adult coordinator for the prison pen pal program through my church, Willow Creek Community Church in, S. Barrington, IL. An amazing ministry. If you love to write, have the gift to mentor and encourage, check out the pen pal ministry through Willow Creek at, [...].<br /><br />There's no greater joy then to serve Him!
B000CNESU8|5.0|outstanding movie. i'm surprised it took me so long to hear about it, but i'm glad i did. an excellent satire on current events to this day with an impressive and accurate script that reflects exactly what's going on in big capitalist america.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|This review is about Toy Story 2 as a movie and not the DVD set.  That being said, the review will begin...I love this movie!!!!  What imaginations the writers had!  I am the biggest self-proclaimed toy(mostly doll) freak in the world, and this story captures exactly what I would imagine toys would think of in different situations.  If I was a toy, I would certainly fear ending up in a yard sale!  And Jessie....oh, Jessie....your song makes me cry!  Emily had no business ditching you!  How heartless can a person be?!!  This movie ROCKS!!!
B001PPF11W|5.0|The first disc in this package is simply a re-issue of the original Pablo Honey album, an album which features unique moments in the Radiohead catalogue and also establishes elements of their sound that would be further developed on The Bends and OK Computer.  But the album is often simply dismissed by critics as something derivative of other acts and/or lacking in quality next to later Radiohead albums.  (It's a viewpoint also often directed towards Blur and their debut Leisure, also a great record.)  I think so much of that posturing is just a result of not giving the record a chance on its own terms.  Songs like \\"You,\\" \\"Blow Out\\" and \\"Creep\\" retain their immediate power to this day, and the album as a whole really does not suffer from a feeling of datedness (like much of the other alt-rock of the 1993-4 era.)    The bonus features in this package really help to further establish Pablo Honey as a worthy starting point in the Radiohead discography by putting the 12 album tracks in a broader context of the band's work at the time.  The second disc features the long out of print debut EP \\"Drill\\" and it's four demo tracks.  The version of \\"You\\" and \\"Prove Yourself\\" were already fine at that point, while the jangly power-pop version of \\"Thinking About You\\" is revelatory for those yet to have heard it, and it makes one wonder how much potential Radiohead could have had to explore quite different musical avenues.  The rest of the second disc gives all of the b-sides and released live tracks from the era, including the \\"Pop Is Dead\\" ep (another wrongly maligned release.)  Finally, a DVD features the four videos from the period (The staged live show of \\"Creep,\\" the humorous rock star posturing of \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar,\\" the fun and enegetic \\"Pop is Dead,\\" and an REM-esque video for a faintly U2-esque song \\"Stop Whispering.\\")  In addition to the videos, all of the tracks from the 1994 Astoria concert dvd from the Pablo Honey era are here (unfortunately the concert is broken up, so the other tracks appear on the reissue for The Bends) and there is also a cut performance of Creep from Top of the Pops, which is silly, as TOTP always is.  The videos and the Astoria tracks really cement how much Radiohead stood out against the hundreds of alt-rock bands of the time.  Thom certainly had his own voice at the time, even if it wasn't the exact voice he would keep over the next 7 albums.  The power of the live performances really brings out the full energy of all the tracks, and all of the songs played prove to stand as excellent live material.    Also included in the package are cards for each of the EP covers with replicated coverart.  There is also a reproduction of the original album booklet.  All 3 discs come in cardboard slip-cases.    An excellent package that presents Pablo Honey-era Radiohead in a proper light, as an excellent and emerging band with a great live show and some real range to their musicianship and lyricism.  So, enjoy it again for itself and if you are a more recent fan who never got into it the first time, now is a great time to get over the negativity you've probably heard lobbed toward this record and give it a go on its own terms.

B000B7HZXM|4.0|[[ASIN:B000WW29MS It Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook]]    A few years ago my sister gave me \\"As Time Goes By\\" part of the Great American Songbook by Rod Stewart.  I never unwrapped and played it until recently. I found out Rod Stewart really swings on this DVD and on all of his Great American Songbook DVD's that I purchased because I liked the music so much.  Rod is no Sinatra, Tony Bennett, or Dean Martin, but he is backed by the big band sound and is teamed on some of the songs by other well-known artists, just like Sinatra's \\"Duets\\" and Tony Bennett's \\"Duets\\".  Great music, lots of nostalgia with the wonderful music of yesterday.  I'm sure some people prefer the Rod Stewart music that he has done in the past, but for me, I would never buy Rod Stewart's music of the past, just the sound he presents on the Great American Songbook DVD's.  All are good so if you like this one, you will like them all.

B001O8C5KK|5.0|I have other recordings of this opera, but this is so fresh. I keep hearing it in my head. I will admit a bias in that I think Angela Gheorghiu is among the best singing actresses currently working. I have seen her here in New York and in London and she seems to me to have everything you want from a singer. This recording has real mood, especially in the third act as it approaches the tragic ending. The conducting by Pappano is terrific. I have recommended this recording to others. As I say I can hear this recording in my head as though I have never heard any of the music before. I also think Jonas Kaufmann is a real find. I have seen him here in NY and in London singing with Gheorghiu and they make a wonderful team. I am looking forward to them together next season at the Met in Carmen. The packaging of this is also terrific. I have no complaints. Get it!
1401207510|1.0|The fact that publishers charge as much as they think they can get out of the upper-most end of the market hurts the industry, the fans, the artist's legacies, and ultimately the medium itself.

B000NVT0RU|2.0|This film does not compare to many other WWII efforts.<br />It is primarily a reminder of the overwhelming Liberal Whacko Trend that will continue until democracy is destroyed by Muslim Extremist or Anti-American forces.<br />It's good to understand the truth- that there has been evil in the world as a result of Bigotry & Colonialism, but to whine about it without ceasing is just unacceptable.<br />Grow up!<br />I recommend another war movie other than this one.

B001BHHQRG|1.0|Death metal superstar Usher takes the genre to a whole new level with his 2008 release \\"Here I Stand.\\" Unfortunately, that level is just beneath the streets: the sewer. \\"Best Thing\\" and \\"His Mistake\\" are the only songs that sound remotely like Usher's original and unique music that made him famous in Slovakia before he hit it big in the U.S. Instead of his trademarked grunge/metal sound, \\"Here I Stand\\" offers a mellower, acoustic vibe. Not good, as Usher couldn't sing a ballad to save his life.<br /><br />Although he had a promising acting debut in Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, it appears that his acting career will be cut short, as now the only thing he'll be remembered as is someone who did Rihanna wrong right before the Country Music Awards. Better luck next time, Usher.

The synopsis that I received was simplistic:\\"Iq doesn't matter.\\"  This fits well into the nature vs. nurture debate and politics of public education.  Spend more money and everything will be fixed because there aren't any genetic concerns.     After reading the reviews, I see similar opinions expressed to the one I heard.  Just goes to show that most people don't understand iq, intelligence, or statistics; but they all have an opinion, and those opinions are nothing more than regurgitation of popular culture.

B000WGWQG8|2.0|I know mine is a minority opinion but I think this was a missed opportunity by HBO. Some of the acting was outstanding and the costumes were great. But the writing, pacing, cinematography and direction were below HBO standards. The history and timeline were a little dicey too.<br /><br />They couldn't include every detail, but that doesn't excuse inaccuracies like all 8 of the Brits charged in the Boston \\"Massacre\\" being found not guilty. Two were found guilty of manslaughter and branded, a scene Irving Stone used to great effect in his wonderful novel about John and Abigail, [[ASIN:0385001576 Those Who Love: A Biographical Novel of Abigail and John Adams]]. The courtroom scenes in the first episode are absolutely leaden as are the scenes in the Continental Congress, which should have been brimming with passion and debate. Also, I know that hand-held cameras are the rage now, but using a constantly jiggling hand-held camera during intimate scenes like the one in which Abigail tends to her dying son was maddeningly distracting and a very poor directing choice.<br /><br />John and Abigail were New England Puritans with a strict moral code who demanded a lot of their children, their friends and their colleagues. But they were also revered among the same for their wisdom and generosity. They had a huge and loving extended family of Adamses, Smiths, Quincys and Boylestons, all of whom, at various times, took in each others' kids, bailed each other out when debts mounted, held family holiday celebrations, etc. What I found saddest about this series was how it depicted them as utterly isolated from any larger social network.<br /><br />The old PBS series [[ASIN:B0013NAML0 The Adams Chronicles]] is available on DVD. The production values are stiff but the writing is better in that 1970's series. PBS's American Experience episode [[ASIN:B000BMSU9K American Experience: John and Abigail Adams]] is on DVD. It contains more depth and detail in two hours than the entire HBO series. And watch [[ASIN:B001TDS2SY 1776 Director's Cut]] sometime. It's a rather corny musical but the debates over independence in the Continental Congress crackle with intensity.s. And watch [[ASIN:B001TDS2SY 1776 Director's Cut]] sometime.

B001CD6FKS|5.0|As a kid in the 1960's, I watched the Speed Racer cartoon a lot. It was an odd show, with a kerchief'd Pollyanna-esque main character navigating his way through hyper-exaggerated explosions and fist-fights with the Mob. All the characters sounded exactly alike, and spoke with rapid-fire bizarre inflections. This was my first exposure to what would later be called \\"anime,\\" I guess...cartoons imported from Japan. I can't say I was a huge fan, but it made enough of an impression on me that, as an adult, I can still sing the theme song.<br /><br />When it was announced that Hollywood was releasing a live action film based on the old show, I rolled my eyes. Haven't we had enough of this kind of exploitation of my childhood? And when the ads for the film appeared, my opinion was sealed-I was convinced that they had `ruined' Speed Racer. To me, the ad campaign did nothing to sell it, and I presume that people like me who had good memories of the original were their prime audience.<br /><br />Then it hit DVD, and on a slow weekend I decided to give it a chance. The film opens with blasts of color and fast editing, and the first ten minutes or so jump around between several different time periods. On first viewing, this can be very confusing, and I still wasn't sold. But by the time the film was 30-minutes in, I realized that I was completely hooked, that I cared about the characters, was biting my nails through the high-energy, high-chroma action scenes, and that my heart was pounding along to the soundtrack, and soaring with the notes of the classic theme song.<br /><br />I have now seen the film about a dozen times, and it just gets better and better. It's the perfect action movie. The casting is inspired, the story is bold (I hesitate to say \\"cartoonish\\") but has enough twists and turns that you will find yourself understanding details of it better on subsequent viewings. And if you aren't cheering out loud for Speed in the final race, well, you just have no heart.<br /><br />This movie pulled off one miracle in particular--the characters of Spritle & Chim-Chim seemed certain to be the most hated characters in movie history (they sure dragged the cartoon down, even for a young viewer!). And yet through a judicious script, excellent casting, and brilliant direction, I actually find myself loving those characters and their perfect dosage of comic relief. I don't know how they pulled it off, but Spritle and Chim-Chim steal the show, at least as far as the secondary plot is concerned. They should have ruined the film but instead they added a wonderful dimension to it (and even some laughs during the end credits).<br /><br />Casting for Speed and his family is also perfect. Susan Sarandon and John Goodman manage to bring tears to my eyes in a couple of scenes, even in the middle of a super-stylish \\"cartoon\\" movie! And Speed is played by Emile Hirsch with just the perfect blend of heroism and naivet&eacute; to capture the essence of the old 60's character's true \\"goodness\\" without making you throw your popcorn at the screen with a groan. Mathew Fox as Racer \\"X\\" was another master stroke. Yes, the casting and the acting in this film is perfect for its smart & wild presentation, and involve you emotionally without ever stopping the action. You have to see the film to appreciate what I mean.<br /><br />If you enjoy fast-paced action and a hero to cheer for, please give this film a chance - it may end up among your favorite action films, especially if you have any fond memories of the old cartoon (and its theme music). I find myself shamed that I did not see this in theaters, so that I could have \\"cast my vote\\" for a sequel, but the least I can do is upgrade my DVD to a Blu-Ray copy--this is one movie that I can watch over and over, and have done so!!<br /><br />By the way, with the exception of one or two expletives and a quick hand gesture, even younger kids can fall in love with this film. My boys (7 & 9) love it, though I had to make a very slightly \\"edited\\" version for them. I can see why they scripted it as they did, and those scenes provided some good laughs, but as a father I do wish they had just chopped out those words. It's too bad that Blu-Ray technology couldn't have been leveraged to provide a slightly 'cleaner' path through the movie for younger audiences. On the other hand, I'm very sensitive to language around my kids and several other parents I know have shown this film to theirs without any hesitation at all. Just wanted to mention it.<br /><br />I wish there would be a sequel, I really do. This movie falls easily in with my top-ten action movies of all time.
B0019M06JS|5.0|\\"I grew up in Sao Paulo in the 60s hearing the Bossa Nova. It was all around us. This was the popular music of our day, with its infectious rhythm and poetic lyrics; romantic, cool, jazzy, sensuous, sublime. I lived and breathed this music. It's in my DNA.\\" ~ Eliane Elias ~<br /><br />I have enjoyed Bossa Nova music as far back as I can remember. How I love its enthralling sounds. About four years ago, while I was searching at Amazon.com for some new Bossa Nova albums that would appeal to my ears, I came across [[ASIN:B0001LYF22 Dreamer]] and after listening to snippets, I was pleased with what I heard and immediately placed my order on \\"one-click.\\" And that was my first exposure to Eliane Elias. That album triggered me to explore her discography and have since added to my collection [[ASIN:B0000C3I8F Brazilian Classics]], [[ASIN:B0000254MU Sings Jobim]], [[ASIN:B000ZN958K Something for You: Eliane Elias Sings & Plays Bill Evans]] and of late this remarkable album, \\"Bossa Nova Stories.\\"<br /><br />The album contains a mix of seven Brazilian songs, five standards from the Great American Songbook, a beautiful Italian song \\"Estate\\" which features the exquisite harmonica playing of a great musician Toots Thielemans, and a Stevie Wonder song \\"Superwoman.\\" The entire album delights the listeners not only with her cool and smooth vocals, but her pianistic flair on Steinway as well. She is backed up by Oscar Castro-Neves and Ricardo Vogt on guitar, Marc Johnson on bass, Paulo Braga on drums and percussion, and an orchestra arranged and conducted by Rob Mathes, a fine arranger who is also known for his wonderful works with Tony Bennett, Carly Simon, Sting, Stevie Wonder, Sade, Natalie Cole, Renee Fleming, Luciano Pavarotti, Peter Cincotti, and The Boston Pops, among many others.<br /><br />For an opener, the versatile Eliane Elias transports the listeners to a place evocative of the pristine beaches of Rio as she confidently sings in English and Portuguese the most-widely recorded and most popular Bossa Nova staple, \\"The Girl From Ipanema.\\"<br /><br />She fine-tuned the best-loved Brazilian standards and made them more engaging and especially pleasing to the ears as she glides to the \\"infectious rhythms and poetic lyrics\\" of \\"Desafinado,\\" \\"Chega de Saudade\\" and \\"A Ra.\\" She is at her utmost best and more at home singing these songs having admitted that she \\"lived and breathed Bossa music.\\" It is truly in her \\"DNA.\\"<br /><br />The chart for a perennial favorite \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me,\\" which starts off with Oscar Castro-Neves' beguiling guitar intro, is immersed with the coolest and typical Bossa Nova arrangement.

I just hope there will be a follow-up album of this genre - Bossa Nova Stories, Volume Two - which will include fresh recordings of my all-time favorite Brazilian classics such as \\"Triste,\\" \\"Mas Que Nada,\\" \\"Agua de Beber,\\" \\"A Felicidade,\\" \\"Manha de Carnaval,\\" \\"So Danco Samba,\\" \\"O Amor En Paz,\\" \\"Insensatez\\" and \\"Aquarela do Brasil.\\"<br /><br />Please give it a listen and appreciate the beauty of Bossa Nova music.Bossa Nova staple, \\"The Girl From Ipanema.\\"    She fine-tuned the best-loved Brazilian standards and made them more engaging and especially pleasing to the ears as she glides to the \\"infectious rhythms and poetic lyrics\\" of \\"Desafinado,\\" \\"Chega de Saudade\\" and \\"A Ra.\\" She is at her utmost best and more at home singing these songs having admitted that she \\"lived and breathed Bossa music.\\" It is truly in her \\"DNA.\\"    The chart for a perennial favorite \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me,\\" which starts off with Oscar Castro-Neves' beguiling guitar intro, is immersed with the coolest and typical Bossa Nova arrangement.

1582701709|1.0|Save your money. This book has little or no value.   Yes, thoughts do produce wealth, happiness and whatever you want out of life.  But its not a straight line. The missing variable is action.   You have to act in order for those things to happen. Its important to resist negative thoughts, as negative thoughts result in negative actions/positive thoughts result in positive actions. Negative thoughts=unhappiness. Positive thoughts=contentment. But the theory that you can think positive thoughts and magically things will come to you, is the same as clicking your heels together 3 times and saying: there's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home and suddenly you're in Kansas.

B001MW0J2O|5.0|Animal Collective has always been a band on the cutting edge of musical experimentation. And while experimentation is good, it's still unfinished searching. Merriweather Post Pavilion, however, marks a new point in Animal Collective's experimental sounds. It sounds as though they've finally got it figured out.     And while many fans may be dissappointed by the lack of wildly eccentric tracks on the album, this is definitely Animal Collective's most accessible record, with pop hooks that abound. And to me, listenability, especially repeat listenability, is as important as pushing musical boundaries, and Animal Collective, a band that excels at both, have far exceeded expectations. Therefore, for fans and new listeners alike, this is the definitive Animal Collective album, at least so far.    Describing tracks is difficult, but every track on this album contains some sublime musical moment, in which all the pieces the song had been hinting at simply come together, making it impossible for me to identify a favorite track.    If you haven't already, get this. It's one of the best albums I've heard in a while, and is an early contender for best album of the year.

B00005JPY2|4.0|Escapist pap?  No.    WATCHMAN captured my imagination through its pre-release publicity.  It sounded interesting in many different ways.  Knowing nothing about the comic novel beforehand, suited my purpose.  First impressions mean a great deal to me, and I enjoy not knowing too much about the film I'm about to see.  (Difference between Opera and Movies.  With Opera, you study beforehand; you prepare to get the most out of the experience.  With Movies its just the opposite.  You don't prepare in any way in order that the experience will have a spontaneous effect.)  Anyway...    Reaction:  An unusual film on many levels, and a very good piece of enteretainment.  Intellectually?  The issues posed by the scenario are neither new, nor particularly urgent.  But, what fascinated me was the manner the director and writer used to manipulate those rarefied issues, from point to point, to heighten suspense and to add to the depth of the inquiry.  Intelligent and skillful.  Very rarely do I find myself wanting to see the movie again, immediately after first viewing, but with WATCHMEN I did.  Though WATCHMEN gave me nothing to care about, the flick gave me a few things to think about.  And so, although this was comparatively new ground in the cape and superpower genre, I was able to follow the story with growing interest from scene to scene.    The nudity of three of the characters in the story meant nothing, one way or another.  Not even the coital fakery of the Like Scenes added or detracted from the story.    The visualization was engrossing, and the effects, though often astonishing, did not detract from the story.  The acting was occasionally terrific (Rorschack.  Note:  How difficult is it to project a character, convincingly, through a head mask?  And to keep that character increasingly human?  Get ready for an unexpected tragedy.)  The pacing was excellent, throughout: Varied, never predictable.  All in all, one can say simply enough, WATCHMEN had DEPTH.  In this kind of comic book fantasy, is that or is that not rare?    What it hasn't got is humor.  Or, should I say, irony?  Or complexity?  The story is as flat as a slogan printed on cardboard.
0780626966|5.0|We all know that the first and the third are probably the best in the series. I still get chills when I watch the original, the amount of time spent on characters, getting to know them and actually liking them instead of just cliche types you just wish would die faster. Freddy is dark and pure evil, hell bent on killinig these kids in the most gruesome ways possible. This is one of those films that hit all the right notes... casting, score, director, everything. The second movie Freddy's Revenge catches alot of heat, but honestly I enjoyed this one as well. Although Heather Langenkamp is absent Mark Patton does a very decent job as Freddy's intended target. Dream Warriors sees the return of Langenkamp and John Saxon. ANOES 4, we finally get to see Freddy in the daytime, which actually was kind of cool, I liked the beach scene. 5-6 were not exactly the best but still, its Robert Englund playing Freddy again, and yes he did get a little more comical than dark (which Englund points out himself in his book Movie Monster). Even with these flaws we still have Kruegar killing off teens in intresting and (albeit sometimes over the top)entertaining ways. Wes Craven's New Nightmare is a deff. one of my favs. Having the actors play themselves was original and just entertaning to watch. Taking Freddy back to being terrifying, dark, and pure evil. My fav scene is when Saxon and Langenkamp are talking and Saxon starts turning into is character, Nancy's father, when she relizes what she must do (with alternating scenes of Freddy rising out of the bed)she accepts being Nancy and Freddy is free. I own this whole set and will continue to love and watch them, even the not so great Dream Child and Freddys Dead. If you are one of Freddy's children then I would highly recomend this box set.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I recently watched \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" and I have not been able to stop thinking about it. For an hour and forty minutes, I was glued to my television and could not look away. When it was over, I just sat there, dazed. This film is truly amazing. Almost everything about it was incredible. First off, Darren Aronofsky is an AMAZING director. The brilliant camera work helped create the frantic mood of the climax of the film. The acting was also very very good. Ellen Burstyn's performance was fantastic as a hopeless widow who has very little reason to live until her life becomes consumed by drugs. Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waylans, and Jared Leto also had powerful performances as addicts who just wanted to find true happiness. This film is graphic, disturbing, emotional, violent....and brilliant. Warning: this film is NOT for casual movie fans who want a Hollywood film. Anyone who watches this film will probably feel depressed, shocked, or like me, blown away. If you can accept all this, then please, do yourself a favor and watch this work of art. It may be graphic, disturbing, and emotional...but most of all, it's real.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|This is one of the few books I will reread.  Like the author, I am in the middle of a \\"down\\" period in my life and the reminder of the classic ways out of the dark days and nights come at a good time for me.  You must learn to love yourself first, ergo the good food and pretty undies to remind yourself that life can be good.  You must quiet yourself down enough to pray and then you can again start to love others.     I read all the complaints about the book being too much about I amd me.  Well, it's darn near impossible to think otherwise when you are in that much pain. It's like being a toddler again.  She went through stages and grew up.  That seems to be the point of it all.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|Wil Farrell is funniest when he is playing a clueless innocent, and no one is more innocent or clueless than \\"Buddy,\\" a human raised by elves at the North Pole. A tremendous supporting cast, including Bob Newhart, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, and Ed Asner, bring vitality and a sort of quirky plausibility to a movie that seems to start out in \\"Rudolf-land\\" and ends up with a cop-on-horseback-versus-reindeer chase scene in Central Park. Peter Dinklage (Prince Caspian's Trumpkin) has a bit as a children's author with an attitude that is almost worth the price of admission.<br />With the exception of Buddy's father choosing one of the few bad judgments that virtually never takes place in that industry (distributing a children's book with the last plot page missing), everything else that happens in the movie seems to flow right out of the characters and from the conflict between Buddy's inherent good nature and naivete and the \\"real-world's\\" jaded cynicism. This is a remarkable movie, and will no doubt tie with Stranger Than Fiction as Farrell's most enduring work.<br /> - Paul Race, Editor, Family Christmas Online

The plot is surprisingly close to the book, making this a good introduction to the story, and the sound track has some very nice songs that work outside of the film as well as in. One feature that makes this especially useful for families with small children is the fact that Gonzo and Rizzo \\"exit\\" the film just before it gets \\"scary.\\"  So if you are afraid the Ghost of Christmas Future will creep out the very small ones (it probably won't, but you be the judge), you just tell them to close their eyes, then you zap ahead until you see Gonzo again.<br />- Paul Race, Editor, Family Christmas Online

B000F8O2PG|5.0|1st I have to say that I am Amazed at the service and speed of which I recieved the dvds I ordered. I was a member of Columbia House and I have been sadly dissappointed with that company.  They took money from my credit card and 7 weeks later I had never recieved the dvds I ordered.  I had to stop the payment on that which cost me and the representatives from columbia house could not and even refused to commuincate with me to let me know what was happening.  With Amazon 3 times I ordered and I recieved the dvds I ordered the next day.  WOW!!!  that is all I can say.  Thank you

Only when he read Diary of a Wimpy Kid, the first book in this series, did he finally understand how much fun it was to read.  He actually couln't wait to open the book!  His enthusiasm has been the same with all three of these books.  I have not read them myself, but someday I will so I can understand the miracle.  Thank you.

The illustrations are fantastic and add quite a bit to the humor.
1416550542|4.0|This could very well have been three different books.  The story involves the family history of three different women:  Eliza in 1900, Nell mainly set in 1975, and Cassandra in 2005 with such different locations as a small Cornish village in England and Brisbane, Australia.  Each would have been a very interesting story to read separately and yet they are all presented here, combined in such a way as to make them unnecessarily complicated at times.  I think some of the character development suffered because of the method for creating the complications.  Close attention must be paid to the place and time headings in each chapter.  That is the way to orient and then re-orient yourself regarding which storyline is being told at this particular point in the book.  And they are not even presented in a regimented, orderly fashion.  It is not 1900 then 1975, then 2005 always following that pattern.  Several times I put the book down because I had become frustrated with it.  Each story has its own set of characters.  If I had not heard about a particular character in a while I had to stop reading to remind myself who that character was and what part they played in this woman's life.  It made me impatient because the reading was not smooth.  In all probability, that is exactly the effect Kate Morton hoped to achieve when she wrote the novel.  Making the reader work to uncover secrets just as her characters were working to uncover secrets.<br /><br />I reacted to this book on a personal level.  It became a challenge for me.  Ultimately, I had a need to finish the book.  I needed to find out how all three of these women could be tied together.  I needed to understand the solution for what had happened to Eliza.  Where had she gone?  Why had she stopped writing the fairy stories?  Who was Nell?  Could Cassandra fulfill Nell's belief in her ability to get to the bottom of so many secrets spanning so much time?  An ability such as is demonstrated by this author to intrigue me so much that I continued reading is the reasoning behind me assigning 4 stars to this work.  For her to have made the compulsion to know how all of the theads tied together so strong within me, she had to write a most complicated, intriguing story.  I'm glad I finished it.  There were twists and turns of the plot all throughout the entire story.  I would not have ever been satisfied if I hadn't seen the actual outcome.  Several times along the way I thought I had it all figured out.  I was wrong.much that I continued reading is the reasoning behind me assigning 4 stars to this work.

0525478183|3.0|This book was okay. I loved the beginning.    It was incredibly funny in the beginning. I don't know if I was just tired, which I was, or if it was really laugh out loud funny. I did laugh out loud in my quiet classroom.    I like the voice of the author. Q had an interesting and distinctive way of telling the story. The sub plots were good. Ex: Prom.    What I didn't like too much was the basic plot. It just wasn't interesting. He has to go around the country searching for a girl he barely knows? She leaves him several vague clues.    The characters were very real. His parents were nuts, but still memorable. Radar and Ben were very 3 dimensional beings, it felt like you knew them.     In all, the only downside was the plot. Seriously, I just didn't find it interesting searching for an obviously hostile girl.    I love John Green's writing style, and I also love his videos. Very funny style, but also real. Original, but not annoying. (Like Meg Cabot if you read too much)    In all, good book, but not one to reread. I did learn a lot about writing though.

If you love classic rock (70s - 80s) with a great twist of the new milennium pop thrown in.... you won't be disappointed!  There will never be another American Idol like him!  Nothing he sings is bad.  I am relieved to enjoy 'new' music without a bunch of screaming or the same ol ballads. He sings that happy medium right in the middle.  Very Very good!

B00003CXA6|5.0|I'm buying another copy of this excellent DVD.  I've watched the Pickett's charge and other scenes many times over the years.  The DVD must have become more and more scratched over the years to where it skips here and there.  It's definitely worth my getting this replacement copy.  The lessons on leadership in this DVD (like \\"The Killer Angels\\" book) teach so much about courage and cowardice, leadership and the lack thereof, hubris and being humbled, influence and frustration, along with brotherly love, and more.      For example, one general requests to be moved from his role with another, senior, general.  He had tried to get this general to allow him to push the troops of the North off the ridge shortly after the North retreated to it.  The North was vulnerable then and there was a reasonable chance the South could have pushed the North off, making the North continue their retreat.  But the senior general wouldn't support that effort.  As a result the North got the chance to establish themselves on the ridge...and the rest is history.      Perhaps the North would ultimately still have won, but this DVD points out so well the role of not so much strong leadership as good leadership or of good and strong men in important leadership roles.    I lived in Gettysburg for a handful of months many years ago and crossed parts of the battlefield many times.  I still feel a deep reverence for the men who died there, for our country and for that God who helped us achieve a breadth and depth of liberty unparalleled in the world.     Get this DVD if you have even a slight interest in history or leadership.

190669415X|5.0|This is the second in the late Steig Larsson's \\"Millennium\\" trilogy. I was so hooked by the first in the series, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,\\" that I decided to send away to www.amazon.co.uk for this sequel, because I was not willing to wait until July for the U.S. release of an English-language version. These days, the pound has been kicked around as badly as the dollar, so I ended up paying largely what I'd pay in the U.S., and the shipping fee was minimal.<br />I really couldn't wait to crack the 700-page volume to revisit the characters: Mikael Blomqvist, the heroic investigative journalist; Lisbeth Salander, a petite powerhouse afflicted (or gifted) with Asperger's syndrome; Erika Berger, the fearless editor and Blomqvist's sometime bedmate; and the intrepid staff of the magazine, \\"Millennium.\\" Whereas \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" was largely about Blomqvist and his search for a presumed-dead heiress, this sequel focuses squarely on Salander and her difficult adjustment with society. At the end of the first book, she abruptly walks away from the faithless lover Blomqvist. She continues her aversion in \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" ignoring him, hanging up on his cell phone calls, tossing out letters, and otherwise pretending he doesn't exist. He's broken her heart and Lisbeth Salander is not one to forgive.<br />However, she soon learns she needs friends--plenty of them--as an ever-tightening noose of danger tightens around her, made up of her evil legal guardian Nils Bjurman, a cadre of nasty social-service doctors and psychiatrists, some rogue cops, members of a Hells-Angels-like motorcycle gang, and a shadowy figure known only as Zala. When one of Blomqvist's best reporters and his wife, are gunned down, police find Salander's fingerprints on the gun and the hunt is on--with the entire police force, plus the host of the other bad guys after her.<br />Larsson keeps the pace breathless throughout the story, which hinges on a seamy sex trafficking trade. Even when he stops to explain what is at stake and how \\"Millennium\\" will cover the story, he never slows the movement. You'd think that in a novel of this length there would be myriad subplots, but there really aren't too many threads to follow. Salander's sad past is deconstructed chapter by chapter, and Blomqvist gets to the bottom of police malfeasance and international espionage. But nothing takes the focus off the chase that Salander eludes so brilliantly.<br />I'm sure there are things that a savvy editor could do to tighten Larsson's prose. He adds a love affair too many and drags out the tense ending to a breaking point. Also, it may not seem odd to Swedes, but Larsson's habit of using the last name for every character becomes extremely confusing, because everyone is an Andersson or an Ericsson or a Nilsson. The sameness becomes mind-boggling. It's impossible to even know the gender of the character.<br />I know about this problem personally, for my own grandfather changed his last name because there were too many Nilssons in the army. He chose a name that was a little more distinctive. Larsson could have learned a lesson there. Using a few first names now and then also would solve the problem nicely.<br />But these are nitpicks.

0762434279|2.0|If there's one thing this book doesn't do, is promise you absolutely that you will be rich.  Instead, it motivates you to try and look at life, your career, and how you spend and manage money a little differently.  However, a real financial education - courses you could take at a community college that teach you how to manage risk, understand investing, real estate, etc etc are ultimately necessary for success.      Interesting anecdotes and stories abound, and honestly they're the best teaching tools used, regardless of their truthiness.  You'll learn how to manage money, how corporations work, and why owning a home could be the worst decision you ever make.  However, there are a few stumbling blocks that really limit the usefulness of this book:    1.  He doesn't full discuss how corporations - and their alternatives - work in detail.  He also says that corporations can be used as tax shelters.  That's not primarily why corporations exist.  They exist to limit the liability of the investors.  The major disadvantage with corporations is that earnings are actually taxed twice - once when the earnings are calculated, and again when the investors are paid out.  You could also say that they're taxed again when you buy something (sales tax) or when you buy property/investments with the money gained.  The point is, corporations are not some magic formula that allow people to keep money that the government would otherwise take away.      2.  Risk is vastly understated with many investments.  He does a good job of trying to slap sense into how people incorrectly view the stock market - by likening dips in stock prices to a sale at a supermarket for toilet paper (as in, that's time to buy), but doesn't explain how securities investment should be done, or even how to evaluate risk.  It basically boils down to \\"if you like the stock, put a ton of money into it and hope to god it does well\\".  He also advises you to use insider information when buying and selling stock, something that readers might not be aware as being illegal.    3.  He acts like having a job is some sort of curse, and people who have jobs can never save money or move further in life.  Yet, he prides himself on being one of Xerox's top 5 sales people.  Apparently everyone should just quit their job or at least direct their attention to something else despite the fact that the earnings from his jobs are what allowed him to make investments in the first place.    Despite how limited and vague the discussion is, it does put a new spin on looking at things.  For example, when you start working, he motivates you to direct your income not on spending and consuming things, but investing that money in assets that will generate you money.  This cycle of earning money, reinvesting it, and then reaping earnings is how people indeed get rich.  However, you don't necessarily need to invest in businesses or real estate to do this.  Mutual funds or even a basic savings account are considered assets that generate revenue for the owners.  Furthermore, he advocates using money generated from assets - like rental income from a real estate holding - to buy luxuries, not income that comes from your job.  This gives your money momentum - i.e. the car payment for a shiny mercedes doesn't come from your paycheck, it comes from an investment.      However, a dark side to this is that many people tend to overindulge in what's known as \\"found money\\" - money that didn't come as a direct byproduct of work.  Really, money that comes from an investment should be used for reinvestment and saving.  Justifying luxury spending on the path to financial security simply because the source of the money is different isn't necessarily wise financial planning.    This book stresses the importance of financial literacy and how the reason people are poor is because they don't understand how money works.  However, this book is only the starting point for a good financial education.  Going out and getting one is the next step if you truly want to be successful.
0446618306|5.0|This book is an excellent quick read for somebody looking for a great love story. This book puts you right into the mind of the main character and walks you through how love can change anybody for the best. The end of the book will show you what true love means to a boy who thought there was really nothing out there for him. I hold this story very close and it's very enjoyable and I recommend it for anyone who loves a good love story. It is a little short and the characters are not to deep but pick it up and read it over a weekend, it will not disapoint.
0979433703|4.0|This deceivingly short title successfully focuses on the common success principle of perseverance. The cover illustrates a typical person's motivation when going at a typical task. At first, when motivation is high, the task seems easy. Then, sometime down the road, before you experience success, you'll find yourself in \\"the dip,\\" where the difficulty of the task becomes apparent. This is the point where most people quit.  Godin encourages one to quit early, if you're going to quit at all--thereby freeing up your time and energy for those things you believe that you can do best.<br /><br />Godin explains that \\"the dip\\" successfully separates you from those that would otherwise be your greatest competition; it also separates you from those already successful in a given endeavor. He briefly discusses the outlier principle, noting that if you wish to distinguish yourself in a particular field that your closest competition will most likely be a distant second (the same is true of you going after an established market leader); in fact those that persevere through the dip and continue with the same effort will find that they separate themselves from the competition in an obvious and distinguishable way.<br /><br />Contemplating his own principle, the author makes sure that you don't find yourself there (in the dip) while reading his book-- it's only 76 pages, with a few extra pages (a tribute to the best and an acknowledgement).
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|I have been reviewing Woody Allen productions in this space over the past year or so. I have highly rated such old Woody classics as \\"Annie Hall, \\"Manhattan\\" and \\"Radio Days\\", those memorable films with New York City its trials, tribulations and traumas as an epicenter. I have also given mixed reviews to some of his later productions like \\"Manhattan Mystery\\" and others based in other geographic locales (\\"Purple Rose Of Cairo\\", etc.). I was, however, fully prepared to fulsomely praise the film under review, \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\", after having heard the hype about Penelope Cruz's performance as, Maria Elena, the talented estranged artsy wife of the central male character, Juan Antonia (Javier Bardem), a Spanish avant guarde artist. After viewing the film Ms. Cruz's performance was certainly Oscar-worthy. Nevertheless the overall production falls flat. And here is why.    Woody Allen has created an important cinematic niche for himself as a performer, director, writer and producer in that netherworld of the alienated modern urbanite, especially of distracted women unsure of their place in the world and their ability to navigate it with (or without) a man. The classic examples of such angst and confusion were various film vehicles created for Diane Keaton (\\"Annie Hall\\") Mia Farrow (\\"Broadway Danny Rose\\", \\"Stardust Memories\\") and along the way Woody himself, his doubts and his inhibitions (in about six billion of his films starting with \\"Take The Money And Run\\"). Here Woody has gathered the old familiar concerns about sexual inhibitions, the vacuity of upper middle class suburban life, the eternal problems with the opposite sex and various social conventions like bisexuality, adultery, threesomes and the like. All very familiar Woody material, although not always set in Barcelona.     With the above-mentioned exception of Ms. Cruz the other characters are Woody's stock and trade of late: young woman with various personal and social problems, with or without Woody asconduit. The truly beautiful and talented Scarlett Johansson is wooden here as Cristina. The lesser known actress, Rebecca Hall, playing Vicky's role is the same. In the end I did not care whether the two women (or three, if we include Ms. Cruz) got their issues resolved, or not. That is not a good sign in a Woody Allen film where in earlier, better films , if nothing else, we are at least left wondering about their fates. Woody, come back to your New York hearth and home with all its tangled energies, excitement, enigmas and hangups. There you are \\"king of the hill\\". Leave Europe for the kids.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|I love Danny Boyle and I appreciate him as director and it's great he has got all the acclaim he deserves, but I'm going to go ahead and respectfully say that I didn't see what the big deal was with his latest, Slumdog Millionaire. Sure, it was a great effort; the photography was great, the music was also great, and the acting for the most part was good, but there were a few things that really turned me off when it came to Slumdog Millionaire. One of them being how the film presented itself in the form of a Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? question and ended with the painfully predictable answer. This was just a way too pretentious and just flat out silly way to start a movie.  I also felt the hackneyed back-and-forth storytelling between Jamal being accused of cheating and the story of his life and how he came to know the answers was trite and very formulaic, especially for a Danny Boyle movie. Also, even though I did like the ending to the movie, it was the exact ending I saw coming within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There were literally no surprises in Slumdog. Just a rather stale connect-the-dots movie. I also felt the dance number at the end credits was horribly out of place and I had to remind myself that I didn't just watch a Step Up sequel, but a Danny Boyle film. Other than that, I would just like to say I really didn't hate the movie, as I gave it 3 stars, I was just hoping for a definite 5 out 5, and in that, I was extremely disappointed.

By contrast I heard many of the same songs live in San Jose recently and the band GELS beautifully.  The live concert was MAGIC.    And I think that his cd/dvd's of LIVE concerts are by far his best stuff.    That said, these ARE catchy songs and I recommend this album to any fan of Bruce.  Just don't expect the musical depth or emotional depth of lyric that has so often characterized Springsteen's work in the past.    Art
071198042X|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. The details of what Freddie collected over the years was fascinating to me. I loved Peter's obvious love for Freddie and the love that Freddie gave him. All the places in which they traveled was very interested also. In that being said, the book did disappointed me also. I know that the book was about Freddie and Peter's life together, but I felt a lot was left out and kind of left us hanging at the end. Some of the things I would have liked to read more on was:<br />1. A little more on the relationship with Freddie and Mary<br />2. More on the relationship of Freddie and Jim Hutton (The subject was hardly discussed and they were together 7 years.)<br />3.More on Mary and Garden Lodge after Freddie died.<br />4.More on the subject of Peter and Freddie as far as the sexual aspect was concerned(I know that they never had sex, but was there ever a time that it almost happened and when.<br />5. How about Peter's love life.? He is putting his life out for all to read,then open up a little about this.<br />6. The last thing is what is Peter doing now and just after Freddie's died.I can't help to wonder since Peter was Freddie's lives were so tightly woven almost being as one, but what was it like for him just after Freddie died? What did he do? How did he go on with daily life after Freddie's death?<br />This is the first book I have read about Freddie and it won't be the last, but all in all, the book was worth the read..

A great story of American men and how they grew to be brothers while they fought through Europe.  Contains first hand accounts of major battles including D-Day, Bastogne, and the Battle of the Bulge.  An amazing read, by the end of the book you come to feel as if you know the men you are reading about.  I highly reccomend it for anyone interested in World War II.

I am a great fan of dogs (I owned 2 myself) and generally like to read stories from NW authors (I live in Oregon). I won't go into the plot ad nauseam as it has already been done here many many times. I will say that if you are a fan of well-written and clever anecdotes this is a book you will enjoy.<br /><br />While yes it is sort of a round-about ways a book about auto-racing, it really is not a racing book at all. Think David James Duncan and fishing in the River Why.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone but especially to dog lovers. It was quite touching. Go fast Enzo. Go fast.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|Obviously, there's a huge uproar over the terrible injustice Magnolia did to this film.  Instead of keeping the much superior translation used in the theatre version, they redid it with one that is nowhere near as good.  It's unfortunate.  If that's something you're interested in, then maybe you should skip this film for the time being.  The following review is of the film, leaving the controversy to the side since that's being expertly covered already here at Amazon.com.    Let the Right One in...what a fantastic film.  After watching the film, I didn't quite know what to say.  I think Roger Ebert said it best:     \\"Remove the vampire elements, and this is the story of two lonely and desperate kids capable of performing dark deeds without apparent emotion. Kids washed up on the shores of despair. The young actors are powerful in draining roles. We care for them more than they care for themselves. Alfredson's palette is so drained of warm colors that even fresh blood is black.\\"     So, yes.  It's about a vampire.  But it's not really.  On one hand, it's a harsh coming of age story for Oskar, a young boy caught between two separated parents who don't really seem to care for him, a school that seems to ignore him, bullies that want to do not nice things to him and a vampire that wants...well, what does she/it want?  Eli, that would be the vampire, meets Oskar one night after she moved in next door to him.  She appears to be about his age, but there's something decidedly off about her.  She lives with a vaguely creepy older man, who goes out and does unspeakable things at night to feed her.  She, like Oskar, exists in a world that ignores her---unless of course they discover what she is, and then I'm sure the world would be filled with more than just bullies.       She tells Oskar he needs to stand up for himself and he does, which leads him along a messed up journey of self-discovery and growing up.  This isn't a heart-warming story (or is it?).  Its vampires don't sparkle.  Of course, with the washed out, cold colors Alfredson paints the story with, nothing does.  This is further exemplified with this excellent Blu Ray transfer.  The film looks so cold, I expected frost on my TV.  The brilliant color scheme is used very effectively and is only heightened with the pitch perfect transfer.  Definitely recommend this version.    At the center of this movie is, I think, a question.  Does Eli, the girl vampire who says she isn't a girl, really love Oskar?  Or is she manipulating him to be her next caretaker?  Can she even love?  I don't know.  And I'm still uncertain by the movie's end, though I have a good feeling I know.  Regardless, it's a terrific film acted by surprisingly excellent child actors.  And I'd recommend watching it.
B000001FSU|5.0|This is one of the best overall efforts from Anthrax. I was lucky enough to catch their tour with this album back in the day. There isn't a bad song on the disc in my opinion. Classic Anthrax.
B000RLCJ5Q|3.0|i was very disappointed that alot of the Magnificent Seven have been left off...i bought it specifically for that song. but other than that it's a good cd.

It covers the whole range of designs, from ones you could pick up in minutes to excitingly-complex ones. For the beginner, the instructions are clear and the photos are gorgeous. If you're an experienced folder, there are designs that will keep you busy for hours watching the design evolve. As an added bonus, it's an excellent resource when your friends ask you to teach them how you folded it.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|If you saw this movie in the theater, do NOT buy this dvd!!!  You will be very disappinted in it. The subtitles have been changed  and they ruin the film completely.  I am returning mine and refuse to buy anything else from this   producer until they correct the problem, AND make arrangments for replacement of the bad dvds that they have sold to unsuspecting buyers.  Amazon should file a complaint to the company as well, since, I believe, this also tarnishes their reputation.  Again...DO NOT BUY THIS FILM!!!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|There is really nothing that I can add as a review- I wanted to give a 5 star rating if only to keep the statistics up.  Let me just say that being a movie buff, I am yet to see this kind of sensuality and romance between two protagonists with just expression and eyes! I am left speechless!  For those of you who have not seen this you don't know what you are missing!!  Every cast is optimum. I cannot say that anyone gave less than 100%  \\"Bot\\" :) this film belongs to Richard Armitage (I am again joining in the chorus here). I am a big Colin Firth fan, Darcy or no Darcy, but RA is indescribable. He oozes sex appeal with that voice and that smile and oh those eyes!!  Five stars! can I give a thousand more? Oh by the way the other technicalities (you know- cinematography, background score, aesthetic value etc.) are excellent too, but it is Richard Armitage...here I go again :)  Ladies beware, he does strange things to your inside, and irrespective of your age you will have hot flush and I am serious!
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This one is a five-star keeper.    The setup was dirt simple - just follow the simple instructions about how to get it to talk on a COM port and you are ready to use it.  Then tell your software what COM port to read from.  That's it.    It locks on as soon as it sees the sky (faster than you can bring up Map Point).  Fast as in sets new standards for how fast it locks on.  I just tossed it to the front of the dashboard of the rental car and it was happy.  The magnet works (doesn't blow off at Freeway speeds) and the suction cup works (holds to the inside of the windshield just fine), but I really did not need them.      I used it to calibrate the speedometer in my cars (with the help of a co-driver to call out speeds).  One car was accurate and the other was way off.    I used it (with the latest version of Map Point) on a trip into the hills and redwoods of California on a dark, foggy, rainy night and it got me there just fine.  A laptop screen makes for one huge GPS display.  The trip would have been hopeless without the unit.    You will need your own software package (such as Map Point) to use it.  You need a laptop or device that has a USB port.    I keep it in my laptop bag so that I always have it when I'm on the go.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|Top-notch in almost every way. And, shaky camera action aside, one of the funnest spy movies ever conceived. Pacing, acting, and editing are all spot on.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|My record collection is blessed with great Brazilian jazz and bossa nova.  From Stan Getz to Antonio Carlos Jobim's Wave to Eliane Elias.  It's a tough genre to pull off - to give it that cool, breezy, laid-back, I-wish-I-had-another-Mojito kind of feeling. If done well, the listener is transported to a gorgeous beach with beautiful women and cool mist of ocean spray, spawned by the hip grooves of quiet sophistication.  If done poorly, the listener is pushed headfirst into the nearest elevator.  I'm still punching the numbers looking for a more exciting floor . . .uh . . . I mean tune.  Krall no longer seems to revel in the music.  Instead, I get a sense she fell in line behind Tony LiPuma and headed to the studio with a few chords and one-too-many string programs.  We witnessed Miles Davis fall from Kind of Blue to struggling through Cindy Lauper tunes late in his career.  Krall seems to be on a similar fall from greatness.  Let us hope and pray she finds her mark again.  This ain't it.  Save your money and pick up Eliane Elias \\"Sings Jobim.\\"
B000002H4C|4.0|Watched the movie long ago and this CD is a great collection as the movie itself.
B001QB9H1A|4.0|as with the previous movies of this ilk this a very energized and entertaining vehicle.
B00004RF8J|4.0|This DVD really refresh my memory of this movie back in the '80. It's still great comedy.
B001H5X7KC|1.0|I had this movie saved in my shopping cart until the price dropped.  I paid $16.99 - $16.00 too much if you ask me.  The trailers that I saw on t.v. are the only good parts of the movie - I chuckled maybe 2-3 times.  How anyone can say it is the \\"funniest movie ever\\" is beyond me.  I know Amazon will not take the movie back now that it has been opened - I'm now hoping that I can sell it at the video store and at least get back half my money.
B00005MP58|5.0|the movie of course is wonderful! the version is a very accurate depiction of the novel and colin firth is a perfect mr. darcy. much, much better than the newest release.
B000I2JKC4|5.0|This one of my wife and I's favorite movies.  And having it in HD just makes it that much greater.  A must have.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is an excellent production of history and the life of John Adams. It not only covers his personal life but it also encompasses our country's historic rise during that time. I was very pleased with the added touches to the story that went beyond what you would read in a history book in school. It portrayed the moods and feelings of the people back then. I felt it was very well acted by everyone in it. And some of the actors looked amazingly like the real characters in history.  It didn't seem too long and never got boring for me to watch, never drawn out so that you fast forward through any of it. I thought it portrayed very accurately the living conditions back then and the toughness required by everyone to survive making a new life in the new country.  I hadn't realized that John Adams had 3 other kids besides John Quincy and the depth of the health issues that they incurred. It was fascinating to watch.  I would (and have) recommended this mini series/movie to everyone. I wish there were more to watch about history of this calibre.
B000YY6790|5.0|Trends may come and trends may go in R&R but Creams Disraeli Gears will always remain a masterpiece. As true to the blues as their first effort but with more of a psychedelic flavor, this album should be required listening for any student of guitar, bass, and drums. Not just because of the stellar playing of Clapton, Bruce, and Baker but also their psychedelic interpretation of the blues jazz idiom.    Gears kicks off with Strange Brew which is actually a borrowed riff from an old blues  standard Lawdy Mama. You can argue that the riff was borrowed or maybe even stolen but what you cant say is that Clapton cant make this riff his own. Clapton is electrifying on this one as Bruce & Baker anchor the song with a heavy bluesy rhythm that is all their own. Sunshine of Your Love is played with a ballsy acid rock attitude throughout as Claptons solo smokes & scorches. World of Pain is a melancholy number with some nice Wah-pedal by Clapton who harmonizes quite well with Bruce here. The next song Dance the Night Away is sung with such haunting passion by Bruce that it still gives me chills to this day. The instrumental break on this one jumps into an Eastern-raga style that comes out of nowhere and can only be described as brilliant. Blue Condition, a slow blues, is sung drearily by Baker whose flat delivery actually punctuates the sadness of the song to good advantage and is a good choice to pre-empt Tales of Brave Ulysses the song that follows. This song is sung by Bruce with divine majesty just before the whole band tear it up on the acid rock instrumental workout towards the middle and the end of the song. The other songs that remain: Swlabr, We're Going Wrong, Outside Woman Blues and Take It Back are all good examples of searing Blues Rock and are as stunning as the rest of the material on this timeless masterpiece.    Clapton, Bruce & Baker along with their producer, Felix Pappalardi (who would then go on to produce and play bass with Mountain) didnt just make a masterpiece here. They set the standard for which all heavy music would be measured.  Outside Jimi Hendrix, their vision of where to take the blues is unprecedented and many rock guitarists past & present said at this point in time Clapton really was God. If youve been sleeping under a rock somewhere and havent heard this legendary recording then you owe it to yourself to purchase this remaster and hear what they were talking about. Essential.
045122499X|5.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth I didn't know what to expect.  I hated for this to end.  A wonderful piece of historical fiction.  Made you feel like you were living on the streets of Kingsbridge and were related to the characters.  Memorable read!
0143038583|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  It is a fascinating subject matter that is really eye-opening about the production of food in our modern society.  I will change the way I select foods based on this book.  This type of book would typically lend itself to a pretty heavy-handed approach, but Mr. Pollan is a deft writer with a wonderful sense of humor, and I found myself laughing out loud as often as I found myself reading bits aloud to my husband.  WOW!
B00132D808|5.0|Let me start of by saying that I heard their first album's material and though it sucked big time. This record though is really good. I could not stand the singer's voice in the first album but the music and harmonies the band performs throughout Pretty Odd makes his voice likeable. It is really rare to find a band today singing optimistically, most are still emo, and by doing this they pretty much blew everything else out of the water.    The feel of the album is very psychedelic. The music gives a nod to the Beatles while still sounding original, the lyrics are almost as abstract as the stuff Van Dyke Parks wrote for the Beach Boys' SMiLe album and the harmonies remind me of the Zombies' Odessey and Oracle. Despite the noticeable influences Panic at the Disco manages to make Pretty Odd sound new, original and fresh which is saying alot considering bands in the past have attempted to do something similar to this but ended up sounding like cheap imitators. The whole piece works as an album, which is pretty impressive since most nowadays sound like singles with a bunch of filler, hear it from beginning to end and it creates a really good vibe. I can't recommend this album enough. Get it NOW.
0060090383|4.0|Rachel's Holiday, Anybody Out there, Watermelon and Angels are each about one of the sisters in the mad Walsh family. The nice thing is that they're all written in first person and have a great deal about the other characters so you really get an all-round perspective of each person - who they are inside their heads and how their various sisters see them.    Rachel's Holiday was a little less romantic touchy-feely than you might expect from a book of this genre. However it tackled a serious issue (drug abuse and rehab) with a nice mix of humour, warmth and inspiration that it made for a lovely read.
0446581348|5.0|This is a good book for anyone interested in doing a better job of applying their makeup. It has numerous tips and procedures to be used for everyday wear and not just for those special occasions. I like the natural look that can be achieved with the right touch of makeup, and Bobbi Brown certainly helps with that. She is not an 'over the top' makeup artist.
0307277453|4.0|I wanted to like this book more than I did. I found Shubin's style of writing to be off-putting. He frequently used cutesy expressions and often wrote as if his primary audience would be young teens--not as if that would be wrong if his target audience actually were young teens. However, I think that a book such as this should have been written in a style that that was more respectful of the intellect of his audience.    I also think the content of the book could have been expanded more. However, that said, Shubin does present some interesting information about various aspects of the human body that are best understood as being carryovers from our evolutionary past. Examples are the vertebrate embryonic arches in the neck area that are modified in different ways in the development of different species, from fish to humans. Another example is the journey that the testis take during embryonic development. He also goes into how HOX genes control the development of various species.    Other books have covered much of this material, some with more clarity and detail, but Shubin does provide at least an introductory view that may get the reader interested in learning more about the subject areas. It could also be given to a creationist who might be open to looking at the evidence for evolution--if you can actually find such a person.    For further reading I might suggest Relics of Eden, by Daniel Fairbanks, and Endless Forms Most Beautiful, by Sean Carroll.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|The scenery in this movie is fantastic, both of nature and the actors! The story line has several twists and turns which kept it very interesting right up to the end. A very good movie.
0553382179|5.0|Marla Cilley used to live in chaos but over the years she developed a plan and turned herself into a very organized person. Her methods work and her writing style is friendly and easy to understand. For most of the book she talks you through her cleaning methods and explains which days she does specific cleaning jobs. While that is helpful I was thinking it would have been nice if there were a few pages to photocopy so you wouldn't have to write everything down. Still if you take notes while reading it is easy to organize all the tasks at hand.<br /><br />I like Marla's idea about starting with a clean sink. I also use her advice about wiping out the sink after each use to keep it shiny. I had actually just cleaned my sink tonight when my husband came home and decided he was going to wash his hands in the sink. Call me obsessive but I wiped out the sink after he used it because I like waking up to a clean kitchen. Marla is right, it does make your day go better when you start the day with a clean house.<br /><br />While Marla talks about getting rid of junk mail I found that if I write to the companies sending me mail and I ask them to take me off their mailing list (even stores like Target seem to listen) I don't have so much junk mail to sort through. In the section on how to cook she doesn't give any recipes or cookbook ideas. My solution for that is to go to the library once a week and get new cookbooks. The library has tons of cookbooks so I'm constantly trying new recipes and making a file of recipes that I love and will make again. If you want you can also look for [[ASIN:0595477747 Seasoned with Love: A collection of best-loved recipes inspired by over 40 cultures]], a cookbook I wrote in my spare time over the years. It has lots of recipes that are easy to make and taste great. There are also free recipes at my site.<br /><br />What this book lacks is a good section on how to clean bathrooms (the author uses windex and all-purpose cleaner - what about disinfecting? - she talks about disinfectant spray she uses occasionally). I clean houses for a living and found there wasn't very much information on what cleaners to use. That would have been very helpful. Personally I currently use lemon scented Lysol and Clorox wipes for the bathrooms. If they need more of a scrub (like a ring in the tub) I use Bon Ami, which doesn't scratch. You can also remove calcium, lime and rust by using CLR, which is found in the grocery store. It works great on stainless steel sinks. For a while I used all natural cleaners but haven't found any that can be used as a disinfectant and my clients didn't like the scents of the natural products. Soft Scrub with bleach is also very effective on mold in the bathroom especially around the top of the shower where it seems to grow. If you are looking for all natural cleaners you can look for Seventh Generation and Mrs. Meyers. Both are excellent lines and I use some of their products in my own home, especially the laundry soaps and softeners.<br /><br />When I'm cleaning my own home I do use a similar system to Marla in that I clean sections of the house on different days. She calls this \\"zone\\" cleaning. Basically I only clean what is dirty and do a few jobs a day. The kitchen is the worst because I love to cook so that gets cleaned almost every day.<br /><br />\\"Sink Reflections\\" also has some good advice on how to get your family to help you clean. She describes how you can make a game out of cleaning the kitchen floor. There are some good ideas about how to keep your family organized and some excellent tips on how to get rid of clutter. If you are moving there is a chapter devoted to that topic. If you are going on a vacation you might find the lists of things to take with you helpful.<br /><br />So for the most part this book is very helpful. It brought back childhood memories of my mother teaching me to clean my room. She put everything in the middle of the floor and then I had to put it all away.Needless to say I think I kept things much more clean after that experience. One of my aunts actually had a small cleaning business and taught me to clean so if after reading this book you still want to learn more about cleaning, hire a housecleaner to teach you how to clean your house professionally. It is worth the extra money and maybe you can spoil yourself by having a housecleaner come in to clean every now and then. To clean a house it normally takes me about 3-4 hours but this book recommends that you do cleaning in 15-minute increments. In my years of housecleaning I've seen some pretty disorganized and dirty homes but with a little effort and a lot of love you can make progress in a short amount of time. So what are you waiting for, buy this book and experience the bliss of a clean organized home!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewmore clean after that experience.

I hope he reads this message so I can just say to him and the soldiers who fought with him that I understand why they fought, and how Germany should be very proud they had such fine soldiers like you.  It was war, and I hope you found some measure of happiness after all that sorrow.  My uncle who fought against you guys in the war told me that there was nothing more scary than the sound of a Tiger tank. He also said many times that the Germans were fine soldiers.

B001GQACGO|5.0|Wow Beyonce you have done it again. Best album you have done so far. Everyone should own this album.
B001N18HO6|5.0|First off I want to say that this is really for the serious Pearl Jam lover. Not the casual soccer mom listener, but a true hardcore fan.    That there are people who care enough to put in the work in to make a box set such as this is a gift to real music lovers and PJ fans especially.    First off this thing comes in a cloth bound box and has 4 records in it. The first thing I did was spin the Drop in the Park double live album which simply rocks. This was a great time for PJ and they played like they meant it (well, when haven't they?).    After spinning the double live album I put on the remixed version of Ten and it does sound better. A little more rocking, vocals a little more out in front.    At this point reviewing the music contained herein is simply not necessary. If you haven't heard Ten then where have you been living? No, this is a collectible. A product that celebrates the band and music and collecting and music geekdom in all formats (literally).    For the money, I just haven't seen a better box set. 1 double LP, 2 single LPs, 2 single CDs, 1 DVD and a host of goodies ranging from ticket recreations, posters, a Mookie Blaylock trading card (if you have to ask stop reading this review) and lithographs, stickers...seriously, it's beautiful. The piece de resitance for me is the re-creation of the original Eddie Vedder demo tape. I can't play it (who has a cassette player anymore?) but it sure is cool. It is worth every penny. I spent an hour just opening and exploring the box while I listened to the live album.    Thanks to the person(s) who put all this together so that we could enjoy it.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|After seeing this movie many times \\"Because\\" it is so beautifully done, I just had to get the soundtrack and enjoy the remakes immensely. Anytime a new generation gets turned onto the Beatles it can only be a good thing.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|If you like epic movies in the grandiose old style of Giant, Dr. Zhivago, or Lawrence of Arabia, you will love this movie. The scenery is fantastic, the acting is great, and the story line is both touching and informative on a subject most Americans have very little knowledge of (the treatment of the Aboriginal people in Australia). My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it equally, which doesn't always happen.
006097625X|5.0|I just finished reading this and absolutely loved it!  I've read comics on and off my whole life and have recently been trying to get into them again.  I picked this book up after hearing how good it was.  The way he explains comics and how we process them blew my mind.      He looks at some history of where comics come from, representing time in comics, different types of transitions between comic frames, how we process different styles, and a ton of other fascinating topics.  It gets a bit heavy at points but that is where it shines.  It is like a psychological and cultural look at comics.    I highly recommend this book to any comics fan and as a gift to anyone who doesn't understand comics.
0061150142|5.0|The Pact was even better than I expected.  Jodi Picoult writes in a way that gives you a mental picture of everything without writing an entire page describing the leaves on a tree.  This story is told from several points of view.  It was very suspenseful.  I loved this book!
B00003CX8Y|3.0|Product was processed and delivered in no time, which was a very big plus.  However, for the price paid I was expecting an original film and not a recorded copy.  The picture looks good but not worth the price paid.      Will not recommend this product unless price is drastically reduced.

B001K3JF7K|1.0|I had to turn on the volume higher, I simply couldn't hear her. Beautiful songs, but they sound like lullabies.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Thank you Michael Moore; award winning documentaries are no nothing more than badly researched infomercials.  I believe we are too wasteful, and have been messing up our environment for centuries, believing we are Lord of all we survey, merrily strip-mining, de-foresting and introducing incompatible species of flora and fauna in our imperialist mania. Yep, we bad. Evil, even. We should worry about the environment, but not the point where arguing about facts and origins turns you into a heretic. It ain't religion, it's science, people.  That's what annoys me so much about An Inconvenient Truth: Al Gore ain't a scientist. Another reviewer compared this film to the Troy Maclure filmstrips in the Simpsons; Al Gore may know some famous scientists, but he doesn't come across as understanding what he's trying to prove with all his charts. He amazingly extrapolates the future for the planet from the last 15 or so years! He shows lame computer graphics of drowning Polar bears! He shows unlabeled graphs...to show us something alarming.  The bad science I can take, as hey, maybe he's just trying to get us all inspired to do our own reseach and talk about the problems. But how can I take him seriously as he is shown driving around endlessly, going through airport after airport, lecturing everyone else about the damage of fossil fuels? Hey Al, remember that internet thing you were so big in promoting? Why don't you use virtual technology to reach out to people instead of burning up petrol and airline fuel? Practice what you preach, boy!  The real flaw of this film is the Gore-abilia - what does his son getting hit by a car, his sister dying of lung cancer and the 2000 election have to do with the issue at hand? I always remind people in arguments to play the ball, not the man. Why was all this irrelevant personal stuff added in? It only served to make the film look like a Sovet-era propoganda film, or at worst, a 96-minute long \\"those grapes were too sour\\" lament.  How this is deserving of an oscar (which went to the director, not Al Gore) or a Nobel Peace Prize, I don't know. Yes, you don't like who's in power, so demand a vote of no confidence, or have a revolution. Handing out awards to people who don't merit them is not the answer. Bring back the documentary art form, and leave cheap propaganda to the fascists.

B000TSIK14|3.0|I'll start off by saying its a solid cd, worth having.  I'm a Scorps fan since the beginnning, particularly the Uli Jon Roth era.  Roth and Michael Schenker were supposed to appear on this, but it didnt work out due to scheduling conflicts.  They have managed to do some touring together though, which is great for the fans.  Other than Eye to Eye, which was just about awful, Scorps tend to deliver some good rock on a regular basis.  No exception here, and the concept idea works.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|same basic story and both great movies.  an undercover cop starts working on a case to bust a group of people who have been hijacking and robbing 18 wheelers.  (in point break it was bank robbers)  the crime leads to suspect that the perpetrators are linked to street racing (in point break they were lead to surfers) so he goes in and starts trying to form contacts and meets mia (in point break it was tyler-both who worked at diners oddly enough) and he forms close bonds with a group of them and finds troubles with a  rival street racer (in point break it was surf nazis) and starts to point the truck robberies at him because of his own personal vendetta (same in point break) dismissing the fact that his friends are the ones pulling off the robberies to support their adreneline rush habits(in point break it was to financially support their endless summer and in fast and the furious it was to keep them up on cars and equiptment)  .   same basic story.  both great movies.
0679411585|5.0|Moore and Galloway use the subject quote from Aeschylus, the Greek playwright, who derived his insights from the Persian - Greek wars of the 5th Century B.C., as the epigraph for the chapter, entitled \\"Mentioned in Dispatches\\" on the after-battle \\"spin\\" that was placed on the first large-scale battle between American and North Vietnamese forces. Once again, Plus ca change... the more it remains the same. Upon receiving the reports of the battle, one of Westmoreland's chief concerns was that there be no hint that the NVA were accompanied by Chinese advisors, whether it was true or not. (It almost certainly was not true).<br /><br />The battle took place in November, 1965, at the very beginning of the heavy American involvement in the war, in the Ia Drang Valley, near the Chu Pong massif, in South Vietnam's Central Highlands, very close to the Cambodian border. At the time Hal Moore was a Lt. Col., in charge of the 1/7th Cav., a unit in the First Air Cav. Division (the same unit was led by General Custer in the battle of the Little Big Horn.)  Joe Galloway was a report with UPI, and was at Moore's side during the entire battle. The authors' were not afraid of Aeschylus's quote, and have produced an overwhelmingly accurate and truthful account of the battle. The \\"general reader\\" should make no mistake; this IS military history, featuring units, tactics, weapons, and strategy. There are some excellent maps to aid any reader, and there are compelling and even haunting photographs on many of the mainly American actors in the battle. As the authors say in the prologue: \\"The class of 1965 came out of the old America, a nation that disappeared forever in the smoke that billowed off the jungle battleground where we fought and bled.\\"<br /><br />Slightly more than three years after this battle I was at LZ Oasis, not much more than 20 miles from the Ia Drang battleground, and one could see the Chu Pong massif to the southwest. But in the intervening three years, the Army had undergone a tremendous transformation from \\"the class of 1965\\"; that class seemed as remote as Aeschylus; we were fighting a vastly different war, imbued with the deepest cynicism and numerous forms of escapism. Although unintentional, this book underscores the vast gulf between two versions of the American Army. Another epigraph was also most appropriate, the one for chapter 4, the \\"Vietnamese military maxim\\" that said: \\"He who controls the Central Highlands controls South Vietnam.\\"  For whatever reason, the authors omitted it even from their Epilogue, but it was almost exactly in this same area that North Vietnamese troops massed, almost nine and a half years later, first overrunning the provincial Highland's capital of Bam Me Thuot, and within short order, the entire Highlands were under NVA control. They raced down Highway 19, pass the base camp of the First Air Cav. at An Khe, and within five weeks all of South Vietnam disappeared, and the country was re-united.<br /><br />Theirs is a thoughtful, accurate military history, but through the epigraphs in particular, and the pictures of their return to Vietnam, with the opposing Vietnamese commanders, the Senior General, Vo Nguyen Giap, and the general at the battle in the Ia Drang, Nguyen Huu An, one senses the wisdom of age looking back at the folly of war. Moore and Galloway serve as worthy icons for reconciliation.<br /><br />\\"Perhaps.\\" is a complete sentence in the last paragraph on the book, which was written in 1992. It is preceded by: \\"Schoolchildren no longer memorize the names and dates of great battles, and perhaps that is good; perhaps that is the first step on the road to a world where wars are no longer necessary.\\"  With America now in its 9th year of war, with no end in sight, I'd love to know what the authors think now. At any rate, they deserve a full 5-stars for this excellent effort.dous transformation from \\"the class of 1965\\"; that class seemed as remote as Aeschylus; we were fighting a vastly different war, imbued with the deepest cynicism and numerous forms of escapism.

B000002KXV|3.0|Donald Fagan is a musical Genius no doubt, and has been part of a great era of music that I would call the Golden Age of Music. The 60's 70's and 80's were all great years for music that touched us in ways that any era may never quite do so again.  Steely Dan was a great sub pop culture band that struck the chord of wry wittiness that always bit nerves and struck chords in you in a way that  felt like a car crash into your psyche; leaving a permanant impact of both pleasure and pain. They were a unique blend of pop rock and pop jazz that drove most of their lp's to platinum status.    Fagans first departure from Steely Dan was The Nightfly.  Appreciating Fagan as a master musician driven by perfectionism and professionalism, naturally at first had me at first listen: loving it. The cover is definitely classic Fagan: creating again, more artsy eye catching humor on his visual perspective of life. But Inside listening to the tunes I soon had mixed feelings, and heres why.  The Nightfly although a nicely arranged album, is signaturte clean in the line of every single Dan recording, but eventually I concluded it was almost too clean, and the material musically I think suffered from fullness that the Dan had always been able to express.    While Steely Dan's arrangements had great hooks and fun fill in between, the Nightfly is slightly lacking in that musical sameness. Thinness and shortcomings seems to predominate not the subject matter, which is good, but creep into the musicality of the album. I think the problem is that Fagan is more of a frontman in instrumentation than are other band members. That makes the tunes less spontaneous I think, for lack of better meaning. Paul Mccartney did the same thing on his first solo LP and it plays out kind of boring mostly in the same way.    IGY, lets say I think its a great tune and a perfect top 40 hit, everyone heard it in almost every grocery store while you shopped in the 80's. But soon after that, the music seems to wane into boredom, lacking the bite and excitement of former Dan arrangements. I think what keeps it going though is Fagans reliable visual recall of events that lay out explicit graphics that take you there on the same trip that he ran.     Greenflower street sort of drags on musically but you dont always realize it because you are taken right into the picture that Fagan is painting, where LuChang's racism has him burning with rage because Fagan hit on his sister...on a darkened ghetto street with crumblinbg buildings and people looking out their windows. The same goes for most of the songs which are visually fulfilling but the music doesnt quite match because it is sort of tedious. Ruby Baby picks it up. It's an even better arrangement than Dion's original. It's a great finger pop bop reminiscent of something Sinatra-esque that has you working your  chair a little, and snapping your fingers. I think its his best number on the disk.    New frontier and Nightfly step back again to somewhat reticent, though again they're visually stimulating. The Goodbye look kind of steps up beat again.  Maxine has gorgeous piano arrangement but seems to more depress than make you blue. The ending song, walk between the raindrops is a the album's romantic tune thats pretty upbeat as tunes go, and has quasi romantic overtones to it.  In the early days of listening to this CD I was still high on my enthusiasm of Steely Dan of the 70's lyrical hooks like: \\"clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail, the test tube and the scale just get it all out of here. Is there gas in the car, I think the people down the hall know who you are. Careful what you carry cuz the man is wise, you are still an outlaw in their eyes...\\" Wow; fun laughable and biting.    I feel that the nightfly is just not in the same league as the original Dan stuff, and so because I'm a Dan fan doesnt mean I have be enthused about this album. musical sparcity seems to predominate here.  Nevertheless I respect its professionalism that only Fagan could have achieved. I do feel that Kamakyriad is a better album and holds my interest musically and lyrically: what Fagan is renown for. It's also a better recorded than is The Nightfly.  I compare it in the same way to Chicago I and II. Many hard core enthusiasts insist that Chicago I is a better LP than II, and I always disagree. Much in the same way, i feel Kamakyriad is a better LP than is Nightfly, but...in the end both have attributes I can't disgard.    But every so often i get an urge to listen to Nightflys \\"intriguing\\" musicality, and then put it away for a time till it hits me again to hear it. So I can't entirely write it off, as it can always take me back to laid back imaginings as has me musing through the lyrics that Fagan is so renowned for.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Snakes & Arrows is an album that is, in a lot of ways, 'mature' sounding, both musically and lyrically, much like Vapor Trails. The lyrics are a little more serious and not as upbeat as on previous albums. This album rocks, though not quite as much as Vapor Trails. The sound quality is back to being good, a big improvement over Vapor Trails, though I don't mind the bland sound of Vapor Trails.<br /><br />The album's opening track, Far Cry, just plain rocks, and the beat and guitar riff in the beginning reminds me of stuff from their mid to late '70s albums. The second song, Armor and Sword, is one of my favorites on the album. It is six minutes long, but never gets boring. Very melodic, yet hard. Workin' Them Angels is another good track. Very catchy. Same with the next track, The Larger Bowl. There are a lot of songs that have acoustic guitar mixed with electric, unlike on Vapor Trails, which is strictly electric guitars and no keyboards, I might add. There are two instrumental songs on this album. Two. Both are good. The second one is a guitar solo by Lerxst Lifeson, Hope. The song Faithless is very strong and another favorite of mine.<br /><br />The lyrics on this album overall are somewhat downbeat and pessimistic. I don't mind this at all. Dark lyrics don't bother me. If they did bother me, I'm the kind of person who can tune out the lyrics and focus mostly on the music, because the music, afterall, is what hooks me.<br /><br />It seems that whenever I buy a new Rush album I need to listen to it several times for it to grow on me. Especially the newer albums. I remember when I bought Vapor Trails in 2002. I thought it was bland musically and in its sound quality. Yes, the sound quality on that album isn't the greatest, but the songs hooked me over time nonetheless. Within a month or two I declared it one of my favorite Rush albums. The same thing happened with Snakes & Arrows, though in contrast to Vapor Trails, the sound quality is outstanding. I think these last two Rush albums are so different from their earlier material that it might take some people several listens before it starts to grow on them.<br /><br />If you like the new direction that Rush started to go in beginning with Vapor Trails, then you should like this album. I like the new level of sophistication in their music and the change in their lyrics with the last two albums. There are enough good songs on Snakes & Arrows to make me give it a 5-star rating.re so different from their earlier material that it might take some people several listens before it starts to grow on them.

B0010OIN90|5.0|I just love these watches. We got two for our kids (6 and 8 years old) and they learned telling the time in no time at all. We particular choose the \\"plain\\" ones vs. the Star Wars ones since they are easier to read. The face is basically what the kids know from school.  We have those watches now for several months and so far no problem at all with the closures. They seem very sturdy. My oldest accidentally took his into the pool (until his screaming mom saved the day) and no problem at all.  So people, go for it. For the prize definitely a very good choice!!
B001437DMA|3.0|I always look forward to the next Satriani release.  I've learned more about how to express yourself instrumentally from this guy than anyone else, that's not even close.  Nobody makes the guitar \\"talk\\" like Satch.  I'd really put an extra half a star on this, if possible.  But to give it 4 is honestly a stretch, its a 3 and a half er.  It stands out a bit more than the previous cd, \\"Super Colossal\\".  Despite its title (SC), it rarely got out of second gear and seemed a tad lacking.  You can always count on some gems with Joe though....and Prof. Satch's first two tracks deliver that, along with the title track and \\"Andalusia\\".  Satch his his usual suspects on board....drummer Jeff Campetelli and bassist Matt Bissonette.
0385340990|5.0|As the reviews creep toward the 500 mark, I'm not sure I can add much of substance except to say, Read This Book! It is as charming, beautiful, funny, intelligent and interesting as all of the other five star reviews promise it will be. The characters are realistic and the setting takes you to a place rarely talked about in other works of fiction. A truly exceptional book.
0380973839|3.0|I was hoping for a whole lot more than what I got with this one.  In some ways I enjoyed the book, but in others I couldn't wait to be done with it.    The Martian Chronicles really can't be considered anything but a very loose collection of short stories, many of which were published separately in magazines.  In fact we only see one character who appears in more than one chapter, thus making for the characterization to be weak with no bond or familiarization to be had.      On the plus side Bradbury can definitely write well.  You see his wit behind the social commentary of the post atomic bomb era and the perception of a interplanetary race as a result.  Witty and fun at times, you couldn't help but begin to enjoy the characters.  Of course the chapter ended a few pages later and you never saw that character again.  His description at times is great: \\"...her eyes were like two immense eggs stuck into a white mess of bread dough.\\"      In the end the short stories pieced together a semblance to a story and you can come away from it with a feeling of mild satisfaction as you read the last chapter.  I would have enjoyed this much more if he would have developed the characters a little more, explored individual time periods (as each chapter is a different month/year) and fleshed out a more coherent plot line.  In the end I appreciate Bradbury and would like to read more of his, but I wouldn't recommend The Martian Chronicles.    2.5 stars.

B000002BQK|5.0|One of Mariah's most exceptional Gifts to date. I was given this CD as a present the day it was released back in 1997. Unfortunatley, There was no AmazonDOTcom to review the album. Therefore, i'm going to express my joy for the album now. I remember hearing \\"Honey\\" when it first came to radio and being so excited about Mariah finally releasing yet another album and just knowing that something touching & moving was going to be on it. getting this album home was the best thing that ever happend to me. To make a quicker review I can tell you what my least favorite song on the album is, And it's \\"The Roof\\". Alot of fans love that song but it's just does nothing for me. The rest of the album is simply BREATHTAKING. On \\"Butterfly (Album)\\" Mariah uses her full range and does vocal gymnastics through-out most of the songs. The songs that literally touched my spirit are \\"Whenever You Call\\", \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Close My Eyes\\" & \\"Outside\\". The Melodies of these songs are so beautiful they bring a mist to eyes, \\"Butterfly\\" is truly a collection of gorgeous ballads. Over the years, Many have complained about Mariah becoming more of a Sex-Kitten. My thing is aslong as she uses that instrument to sing beautiful eye-watering ballads like these it doesn't matter how she looks [To me atleast]. Overall \\"Butterfly\\" is a True Treasure that beholds ,Once again, Some of Mariah's most Quality Material to date. This voice, and the songs that it once sang will be sadly missed. Mariah, thank for such a gift.

B0012E6R3W|4.0|Finally, after waiting years since the Gathering, Testament returns.  With Alex Skolnick and Greg Petersen back, the metal machine is ready to crush.  Some of the heaviest stuff I've ever heard with Alex on it period.  He's put the jazz fusion behind him, and is back to full on metal mode again.  Paul Bostaph is a good fit behind the skins, fresh from an Exodus stint.  Ex Exodus (and former Legacy) singer Steve 'Zetro' Souza contibutes some backing vocals here and there.  An excellent cd, anyone thinking true metal is dead doesnt know where to look.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Oskar is a lonely and disturbed young man, living with an alternately distant and overprotective mother, whose loving but alcoholic father has left them.  He is bullied at school, and Oskar imagines what it would be like to frighten his torturer as he has been frightened.  Then he meets Eli, an apparently odd but pretty young woman who moves next door, who turns out to be something altogether different.  The relationship that develops is both extremely touching and utterly disturbing.  The film touches upon themes that are at the heart of the Showtime series [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter]], but with a tenderness that reminded me of [[ASIN:B000087EY5 My Life as a Dog]].  It is a completely unique cinematic experience (a nice alternative to [[ASIN:B001P5HRMI Twilight]]), well worth watching, and that must be seen more than once to catch the most intriguing elements.<br /><br />This astonishing film deserves to be seen widely, far beyond the \\"cult film\\" and even \\"arthouse\\" audiences that have been wowed by it in theaters.  Here's hoping that with a newly subtitled version on dvd and Blu-ray (it is unclear whether the announced update is what you'll get when you buy it through Amazon), this film will find the mainstream audience it deserves.  It is, by far, the most moving scary movie I've ever seen - for its unique combination of innocence and dread, the only precedent I can think of might be the fascinating [[ASIN:B000035P5R The Night of the Hunter]].  The atmosphere of the film is perfect, the story is gripping, the acting is brilliant, the cinematography is powerful (capturing the point of view of children, and attending precisely to the details necessary to tell the story without superfluous imagery, lit to just the right levels to create a stark contrast between day and night).  Highly recommended.
1416562605|3.0|Let me start by saying that this book is certainly an above-average debut in what has now become quite a crowded and competitive space for novels about the sub-continent. Prose is beautiful, energetic and certainly works well to drive the story along. It makes the novel a swift read; there were hardly any passages that I felt like skipping or skimming over.    However, when I think of a Booker's prize winner, I think of a work of fiction that astounds in its depth of thought, with a style of prose that does not just deliver the plot line with sprinkles of humor but rather slaps you out of a lulling stupor and sends electric shocks up your spine. If it does not do that, then it should not be a Booker's winner.     I felt the same way about 'The reluctant fundamentalist' by Mohsin Hamid. That was another novel that received big praise from the western media but seemed rather bland to me, lacking even in material and original ideas. Perhaps it is because I am from the sub-continent myself and the ideas presented are not so original or out of the ordinary to me. Even then, I believe that the prose should take care of that and for me, Adiga's words did not cut it in White Tiger.
B000FZETKC|5.0|I have always liked this movie ever since it came out in the 80's.  I had it on VHS but I kept looking for it on DVD everywhere.  I decided to look on Amazon cause Amazon has everything...and I found it.  Thanks amazon!

B0010V4TSW|4.0|With Tom Naumann out(again), Magnus makes perfect sense.  I have the first Allen/Lande album, with Magnus not only playing guitar, but apparently writing and producing about everything on it.  And its very good.  I'm not sure why one of the other reviewers thinks bands \\"lose power\\" over time, I havent really found that at all.  And I dont notice that on this disc either.  New Religion has some gems....the \\"Darkness/Fighting the Darkness\\" idea stands out, along with \\"Psycho\\".  Ralf, Mat, and Randy will give you a blast of power metal consistently, what more could you want?
B000002IG4|2.0|Advice to the ladies out there: If you are dating a musician be prepared that if you break up with that person, he or she is likely going to write an album on how much they now hate you.  Many noticeable artists have done this before.  Justin Timberlake, Eminem, Michael Jackson, Carly Simon, but one of the most noticeable releases was that of Phil Collins when his wife Joely divorced him.  With the divorce getting ugly and bitter for both parties involved, Collins locked himself up in his studio and began recording to release some of his bitter emotions.  The result is \\"Hello, I Must Be Going,\\" one of his weakest albums to date.  Granted, for people who might not like Phil's other albums this may be for you.<br /><br />Unlike some of his mainstream albums and hit singles, this Phil Collins is angry, bitter, and sarcastic, with nary a trace of humor to be found.  The opening track \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" shows Collins ready to let loose some anger, and he doesn't care whether you like it or not.  And that's exactly what he does for the firs four tracks: Vents.  He vents, vents, and vents.  Sadly, for all the anger directed in these songs, they don't provide much of an enjoyable listening experience.  The second half of the album is slightly better, starting with a remake of \\"You Can't Hurry Love.\\"  At this point Collins contemplates the purpose and place for love in the first place.  It's a much calmer, more thoughtful, more mature second half, where the thoughtfulness can be felt in the music itself.<br /><br />Still, despite the second half being more interesting then the first, Collins would have done well to save a few of the highlights and shelve the rest of the album.  This is an album that is probably too personal to please many people.  I'm glad he managed to get all this pent up frustration off his chest though, as what followed were much better, much more enjoyable works to be sure.<br /><br />Grade: ** stars<br /><br />Download This: You Can't Hurry Love, Don't Let Him Steal You're Heart AwayAway
B001PPGAIA|5.0|All the reviews I read were terrible - so the flock believed and missed a wonderful adventure. I loved this film!  When I asked my friends/ family / acquaintances if they were going to see \\"Australia\\" they said, \\"No, the reviews were really bad!\\"  So I told them the reviews were wrong and to do themselves a favor and go see it.  They did and they loved it too!  It's a wonderful history lesson about the Australian cattle industry, about the Aborigines, about the attack by the Japanese  on the harbor of Darwin.  It has everything: action; comedy; goodness vs. inexplicable evil; the mysticism of the Aborigines; the tragic fate of the Aborigines children; two unfolding love stories; magnificent scenery; gorgeous music; wonderful acting.  It's about determination, courage, race, magic, loss, triumph. The cast is fabulous!  I knew it was quite a long film before I went to see it, but it was so engrossing the time just flew by!  \\"Australia\\" is coined as an \\"old-fashioned, they-don't-make-'em-like-that-anymore\\" epic film.  Thank you, Mr. Luhrmann, for this inspiring and uplifting film!  I wish it had been more successful for you at the box office, but I do believe that \\"Australia\\" is one of those \\"sleepers\\" that one day will be considered among the best.  Critics be damned!!!     P.S.  I keep checking Amazon.com to find the soundtrack.  Nothing yet, but I remain optimistic!

006135323X|5.0|This is surely one of the decade's best books on decision making, economics, psychology and behavior - because it touches all of those topics. Author Dan Ariely is a distinguished academician, but his style is so clear, accessible and straightforward that he does not seem to belong to academia at all. Although he recounts numerous experimental procedures and discoveries, he never bogs the reader down in technical minutiae or jargon. Moreover, he provides a clear connection to the reader's life with every account. The book is eminently practical and stretches beyond the boundaries even of the several sciences in his research. At times, themes from spiritual and philosophical literature resonate in the text. getAbstract believes reading this book can help anyone make more conscious decisions - no matter what those decisions are about, from setting a corporate strategy to finding a date to just choosing what brand of soda to buy.

B000002J1U|5.0|This release is a very different from earlier releases by Led Zeppelin.  The first side is very heavy, with one of the brilliant vocal performances by Robert Plant on \\"Immigrant Song\\", that is possibly his best work.  The next cut, \\"Friends\\" features an unusual tuning with Indian scale influences.  \\"Celebration Day\\" is an unusual time signature starts with a sliding guitar riff.  \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is a slow blues number that showcases Page's and Plant's blues roots.  \\"Out On the Tiles\\" is a classic Zep song, with power guitar chords set against strong drumming and a tight snare.  What was originally released as the second side of the vinyl allowed a different view of the heavy metal pioneers.  \\"Gallows Pole\\" had hurdy gurdy, acoustic guitar, tabla drums and an ironic tale of barter.  The following song \\"Tangerine\\" is a lovely acoustic number with harmonies that carry the chorus.  \\"That's the Way\\" is another stripped down acoustic number with more layered choral harmonies. \\"Hats Off to Roy Harper\\" is the closer, an anthem to a friend and musical footnote, famous for singing lead on the Pink Floyd cut, \\"Have a Cigar\\".  Unusual looped vocals, compressed effects and sliding dobro make this one of the more interesting Zep takes on standard blues changes.  In all, this is a different release, which showed the acoustic side of a previously metal band.
