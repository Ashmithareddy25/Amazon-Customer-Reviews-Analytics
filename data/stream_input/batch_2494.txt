B008ALAHA4|1.0|When I received this I realized I had to spend another $200 to put it together.  It's just too much money for how I intended to use this.  I have heard rumors that Apple will have a 14 hour battery on the next MacBook Air.  I'll wait for that.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Amazing!  I'm a big fan of Daft Punk and I have a newfound respect for them after hearing this album.  It is NOT a typical Daft Punk release, nor is it a collection of dance floor bangers.  What it is is a collection of instant classics.  I love it!  The vinyl sounds unreal too, so glad I didn't purchase the CD version.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I did not start watching this series until the second season.  I bought the whole series and could not be happier.  Wonderful!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|The perfect tape for crusin down the road or a nice night  with so one special very mellow!!!  I have already ordered more of his tapes
B0091REZMW|4.0|One thing I like about this game is that as your level goes up, you get more energy for searches.  It does lag a bit on my Nook Color, but suspect this is due to running it via N2A. So far so good.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love playing this game, it's addicting.  I play Angry Bird Star Wars as well and have just as much fun
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|This was so irrational that it was a total waste of time. I rarely feel this way about any book and if it wasn't a book club choice, I would not have gone past the first 20 pages.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|We very much enjoyed this movie.  It was action packed and suspenseful.  Appreciated no sex.  Acting and storyline were great!
1476734941|5.0|we bought the book and have followed the guidelines for 3 weeks and both the wife and i have lost 6 pounds each. very good...it isn't as hard to fast as i thought it would be, especially after you get used to doing such!
B009ME47H2|5.0|This is a great app! I have used it to record my thoughts down while I am thinking about ideas for my books. Sometimes, I may be somewhere without pen and paper and this comes in handy.
0446560065|5.0|Best book ever! My boyfriend and I are head over heels in love with Simon's Cat! I stummbled upon the youtube videos then found the books. They are incredible to flip through.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is so perfect for the beginning writer. It has helped me a lot in getting my book ready to publish on Kindle. I would highly recommend this. The step by step guide is great for a newbie publisher as myself. I have this as one of my favorites!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Would not download on my Toshiba Thrive.  Sending me an email about what I think of the app works fine, download of app is a total bust.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is the first book I have read on Kindle. While I have no plans to walk the 'path to greatness', I enjoyed reading about the extraordinary life of Nikola Tesla. Would have liked it to have been even longer. The book, not the life. Thanks for an interesting read!
B00A6CT012|5.0|I saw the author on a talk show promoting her book while I was waiting for a surgical procedure.<br />She sounded interesting so I purchased the book when I got home on my Kindle Fire & found it to be extremely insightful.<br />The book made me realize what changes I can make in my home & business.<br />The book has some great information & tips to improve the quality of our lives & reduce the clutter.<br />I did take her recommendation on how to stop the phone books, credit offers & catalogs that are mailed to our home.<br />Also, I was able to donate/sell some of my son's used sports equipment.<br />I would recommend this book!
B0055CJ8T2|3.0|I like this cd but only a couple songs on it got me to sing along. She is a good artist but this is not her best album.
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|This is a truly amazing vinyl record! It is red vinyl and very thick, twice as thick as regular vinyl LP's, but is still translucent. The playback is excellent, no pops or clicks. The packaging is top of the line. This is an Audiophile set by Audio Fidelity and is a numbered edition. The art work is incredible. The record sleeve is audiophile quality, rice paper with plastic inside to hold the record and avoid static. It came with an outer heavy plastic cover to protect the album cover. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|I chose this rating because only half of the songs got my attention. I mostly liked the fast songs on this album. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of chris brown.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was great. It was easy to read and it was very interesting. The book was relatable. I couldn't put the book down.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Rihanna has great hit songs on this album. I never get tired of hearing &#34;pour it up&#34;. I would recommend this album to my friends.
B000H0MKOM|3.0|Pretty funny. Lot of people REALLY hyped this up though. Love Robert Carlyle in it anyway. So that's why I rated ok.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|I rated this a 5 star because i love nicki minaj, this is a great album. She has alot of hit songs on it. I would recommend this to all nicki fans.
B00838HRP2|1.0|The DVD did not work when we received it.  It was read as an error on multiple players.  I had to return it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|When my neice suggested this read I was thinking,&#34; This will be a while&#34;.  To my great surprise I couldn't put it down.  I am recomending this book to all of my reading family.
B003Z0BSU8|4.0|When I first heard this pianist I was taken with the beauty of his playing and have been trying to get thr CD for over 3 months<br />imagin finding it on your web site thankyou very much.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was great!!!!and very interesting too. The kid has a weird family. Manny is annoying. Roderick is mean and dumb.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|All my children, love playing this game, it is always being played by them. if they had to choose one game to play, this would be the one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I REALLY THINK YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME!<br /><br />I REALLY ENJOY IT. FANTASTIC! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!<br />I FOUND THIS GAME BY ACCIDENT AND FEEL LUCKY
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was awesome. Practically perfect in every way.  Everyone should read this book.  This app requires me to write more, but I said it all.
B006L4MX0Y|3.0|The main thing I learned from watching this movie was not that Susanne Collins might have stolen the idea for \\"Hunger Games\\", but that the Japanese people have a very high pressure cardiovascular system which causes their blood to explode and spew in a huge fountain-like jet spray whenever an artery is ruptured.<br /><br />Bad special effects you say?  Of course not, just watch \\"Sanjuro\\", or other classic Japanese movies (see Comments section below for YouTube links).  The master, Akira Kurosawa,  demonstrated this aspect of the Japanese in his movies.  Probably that's why they lost WWII.<br /><br />And oh, Japanese teenagers, especially the girls, all have really high pitched voices and squeal and squeak a lot, whether they are terrified, about to die, happy, excited, in love, or just getting ready to have a bowel movement.
0452287022|5.0|A sharp, sensitive and absorbing novel of 17th century Netherlands, combining history art and fiction. The remarkable author Tracey Chevalier fleshes out and embellishes the story who the girl in the painting by Johannes Vermeer could be.<br /><br />Griet, a 16 year old Dutch girl in the town of Delft from a poor Protestant family is hired out as a housemaid to the wealthy Catholic painter. His household include Vermeer's vain and jealous wife, Katharina, Katharina's cordial and wise mother, Maria Thins, Tanneke,  the Vermeers' other older household servant and the Vermeer children.<br /><br />Griet is wooed by Pieter, the handsome son of the local butcher, while Griet's parents worry she is losing her soul in the ostentatious Vermeer household.<br />Griet's sister dies of the plague, and things grow more difficult for Griet, in her place of work, and in the circumstances of her family.<br />which become more desperate.<br /><br />But the novel reaches its climax when Vermeer coerces Griet into being the model for one of his most ambitious works. Things spin out of control though for Griet there will be  happy ending.<br />Heartwarming, in parts amusing, a fable of self and disparate components, and hope and despair. A sterling piece of literature form a master novelist.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|Well,  I really enjoyed Daemon and Freedom(tm) was fairly good, if not a bit preachy.<br /><br />But after reading Freedom and then Kill Decision, I have come to the conclusion that a PR firm must have been mean to him at some point in his life.  If there is one consistent villain in his books lately it has PR agencies.  It seems a bit trite to use the 'big bad company' and it's PR flacks as the generic evil in movies and the like late (harder to offend I guess), but it seems to have become a recurring theme (as much as it can be in two books) in his work.  I think it is a very readable book, it is just I think he has played out the 'evil corporation' thing.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|A full movie's worth of action before the opening credits even roll!<br /><br />Good job staying consistent with the original characters, although &#34;Bones&#34; was a little TOO crazy, he certainly was fun to watch over react to everything...
B000002JKA|5.0|Amazing album.  Such a talented band - the percussion, guitars and vocals are mind blowing.  I find myself even reading the lyrics without the music playing to fully digest the meaning of each song.  You can tell Dream Theater pours over each note as they carefully write their songs.  Now I know why their fans are so loyal and enthusiastic.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I was so not an Harry Potter fan at all until I read all of the books. OMG I watch this at least once a month. Read all books first the watch the movies she will understand so much better
0812550706|5.0|My students ask to read this book year after year. I use it for summer reading for my Pre-AP students as well.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I am a fan of Tom Cruise Characters, I thought this role/movie was &#34;out of Character&#34; in comparison to other movies starring Tom Cruise (let's say) in the last decade. I think the previews and the promotion people were &#34;playing the biggest role&#34; by marketing this film to the &#34;Tom Cruse&#34; fan base.<br /><br />The movie was okay, to be honest, it reminded me more of a late 1990's or early 2000 screen play (example: John Travolta in Basic). I paid too much to rent this, I should have waited and got it from Red Box
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just love this series and find the characters and plot fascinating. I wish we had more shows like this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want to play minecraft with my friend but I cant help me besides that its awesome lots of fun
0544002318|5.0|I have so much respect for Scott Jurek.  Not only for his racing record, that speaks for itself, but as a person as well.  He is a great role model for runners and non-runners alike.  Here's a guy who didn't start out as the fastest or most talented runner, but he does have the guts and the determination to get the job done even if it's extremely difficult and at times downright painful.  I'm not a vegan and I don't plan on converting, but Scott brings up some excellent points about the importance of diet and I never felt like he came off as condescending towards people who aren't vegan.  He just acknowledges that when he made the transition he felt better and noticed improvements in his training, racing and recovery time.  Scott includes various vegan recipes in the book which was cool.  I would definitely give them a shot, there were a few that sound really good.  The book is also packed full of exciting race stories, accounts of overcoming physical and emotional obstacles as well as interesting views on the ultra-world from a living legend.  Eat and Run has something for everyone, I highly recommend it.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This one is loads of fun and the puzzle configurations are great.  They are complicated enough to keep you interested but not too much to frustrate.<br />Vicky
B0044C5SCU|4.0|I like Fringe as a follow on for those suffering from X-Files withdrawal. Parallel universe based sci-fi tend not to hold my attention but in Fringe's case, it's done well enough that it holds my attention and keeps me entertained. Perfect? No. Predictable? Sometimes. Entertaining. Yes. When you're waiting for the next season of The Walking Dead, or Game of Thrones to appear, Fringe can fill the gap quite well.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|How refreshing to have an original story and actors enjoying their roles. I often judge a movie by the after-taste and I can report this movie left nothing but positive recollections. There were only a few of the x-gen snarks and &#34;really?&#34; comebacks. Deniro finally played a role as a human being and his vulnerability and humanity is what made him good to start with. Cooper is good although the garbage bag thing got a little old after the first hour. You will fall in love with Jennifer Lawrence. Like actually in love. This girl reminds of Robert Duvall - wait, stay with me, like Duvall in that she lets the scene simmer, doesn't rush her lines, each one as if it just popped into her head, she is the star of every scene she's in. I bought this on Amazon for my Kindle Fire for a business trip, but I'll be buying the Blueray for my collection at home also, that should tell you something. Enjoy!
0374275637|5.0|Its excellent, thought-provoking book.  Daniel Kahneman was awarded Nobel Prize in Economics and you will understand why by reading this book. It will also tells you a lot about current state of economics and why it is a soft social science rather then hard science, quantitative one. Economics is about a Human Action, not a stats & numbers! ... and at last, but not at least this is a Great psychology textbook!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This book grabs you at the start and just when you think you figured it out another twist and a new direction.  I read on the train to and from work each day and the time just flies by.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|Rented this for some good action. The movie satisfies in that regard. A few good fight scenes, a good car chase.. but not a lot of character development as far as the bad guys go. Cruise was good for the most part but I felt like some of his lines that were supposed to be funny did not come off as funny as intended - they felt a little forced. Even the ending seemed a little unfulfilling. All the loose ends were tied up and they kinda left it open for further films but it was just anticlimactic.<br /><br />Not horrible but not Cruises best work - although it was cool to see him share some scenes with, Days of Thunder costar, Robert Duvall again. Wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to THAT movie!
1423151054|5.0|This is the perfect gift for an inspiring animator or Disney enthusiast. I got this as a birthday gift for my fiance and he loves it. The package came in great condition and the drawings in the flip books are beautiful.
B003SNKBXW|4.0|I thought this was a wonderful book, however, the editing was atrocious!  Words were misspelled, or more often than that, incorrect words were used instead.  As you can imagine, this makes for somewhat difficult reading.  Also, the punctuation was horrible, complete paragraphs with no punctuation whatsoever.  I could understand if that was the way in which the book was written, but instead it was random.  If you can get over the editing (at least in the Kindle edition) then definitely read the book, it's a great story.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The experience of introverts in the extrovert world. Why it is fine to be an introvert and how to adapt to the extrovert world. Great book, I would recommend it to everyone.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I purchased this collection for my daughter for Christmas. She loves to watch these movies over and over. The picture quality is great on blu-ray it's like a movie theater experience.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Top to bottom the album is awesome. I hate starting it when I can't finish it! Which I had four hands so I could give it four thumbs up!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Awesome cast.  The talent is unbelievable.  All but the obvious exception....the Jonas brother.  Other than that no-talent prick, this is one of the most amazing recordings of Les Mis out there.
B009G3T01M|4.0|Mack comes through for me on most tracks! 10,000 hrs is a super clever shout out to Mr. Gladwell's book Outliers (which is a must read). Can't hold us might be one of the most infectious beats ever! My Two year old can't help raise her hands up and dance around the house. The short and sweet is The Heist was a major Surprise to me. I loved most of it and really wanted more! Thanks Mack for bringing back hip hop back to a respectful level lyrically.
0439023521|5.0|So when everyone was getting all excited for the release of `The Hunger Games' film, I was sitting there thinking `OH GOD NO!'. From what I heard it was going to be the `New Twilight', and quite frankly, I couldn't think of anything worse. Whilst the Twilight books were quite good, the films were the worst things I had ever seen in my life, and I couldn't bare to think of another seemingly good book go down the drain.<br /><br />But anyway, a friend bullied me into it, and I downloaded Hunger Games on my kindle.<br /><br />It was devoured in the space of 24 hours and then Catching Fire and Mockingjay were immediately downloaded and yet again devoured in the space of 48 hours.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' writing style is electric, and I honestly could not put this book down. What I loved most is that Katniss is not your typical heroine. She isn't a particularly nice person when it gets down to it. She is loyal to her family, and to her that is all that is important, which is a wonderful trait for her to have, particularly given the dangerous and poverty stricken life she lives.<br /><br />Peeta was a wonderful character that I took to straight away. Whilst it is probably true that Gale would be better suited to Katniss in temperament, I really loved how strongly Peeta felt for Katniss, and how he was willing to give up his life to keep her safe. They were complete opposites, but they seemed to fit perfectly, like two sides of a coin. Katniss' returning feelings for Peeta were wonderful to read, as we know that she does not love him in the same way, yet that is OK. We know that Katniss would never fall in love easily. She is too stubborn and level-headed to believe that love would help her in any way, so it was wonderful for her to realise that love does exist and that maybe she could one day be capable of giving it.<br /><br />The story of the capitol and the games was tragic. It gives us a reminder at just what the future could hold for the planet, should repressionof rights continue as it is in some countries. How far will the leaders of the world go in a bid to maintain order? A thoughtful and quite frankly scary idea, but so cleverly put into writing.<br /><br />5 stars and a definite recommended read!
B004UIOUHC|1.0|Too slow, missed links, could not use it.  Very disappointed, I expected a more polished product from an experienced vendor...but..<br />I was fooled. Back to Safari for me.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Bruce Willis movies are always fun.  This one was quite thin on plot...quite thin.  But the good guys one in the end and seemed to have fun winning, in spite of the blood and difficulties.
B000LPS4BG|3.0|i was 6 when this came out & i remember watching it when i was little & i just thought it was okay. i haven't seen it again till now in my late 20's & it's still just an okay movie. i dont seee what the big deal is. scorcese is my favorite director but i don't even think this is one of his top 5 movies. godfather 1 & 2 & the Departed blow this out the water for mob movies. now for the quality of the blu ray disc itself. the godfathers bit rate is mid to high 20's while goodfellas is 9 MBPM. a dvd of goodfellas probably looks almost just as good. & theres still that line that runs down de niros face. bottom line.... this movie ain't one of the top Mob movies & the blu ray is nothing special.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Wow!! Never in a million years could I have guessed the ending to this story. Was not too impressed with beginning of story but my oh my what an ending.
0061906220|5.0|Bought these for my 5 year old nephew at the recommendation of teacher friends.  Read through it, and thought it was a really different and fun book with a great message.  :)
B00CDT41RY|4.0|It won some awards and it deserved them. It's a great watch with very good acting. I was suprised to see what stars are in this film.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Like it for all the &#34;twists&#34; and &#34;turns&#34; .<br />Not a blockbuster, (not enough action) but I would recommend just because of the cast.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|adorable movie and is constantly attention grabbing! Children age range from 1 yr to 7 yr old. Always a request on movie night :)
B001NHNG64|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down good thing we had a long weekend in a quiet cabin .
B00CL68NOG|3.0|It was a good movie but just thought it was going to be funnier.  Not the plot thought it was going to have.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|LOVED IT! (It's actually very informative...give it to a family member that has an addiction issue and don't tell them about it.) The movie is exciting in the beginning but then becomes apparent that it is about addiction. I'm very sure this goes on in real life. A MUST-SEE MOVIE! Enjoyed watching it! Anything Denzel Washington is in -- I ORDER!
0810971496|1.0|This is a work book for kids to fill in information about themselves.  We bought a 'new' book but when it arrived it had numerous pages throughout the book already filled in.  Clearly a 'used' book and it should have been sold as such.  Definitely do not recommend this supplier.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great game once started can't but it down . I like I can have it on my kindle so when I have to wait for an appointment I can play it .
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is one of those rare animated films that makes you forget it's drawn as opposed to live action.  Miyazaki consistently delivers the most beautifully animated and written stories you can imagine.  To me, Spirited Away is his masterpiece.  Full of heart and warmth while mixing in a little bit of suspense and humor, Spirited Away manages to capture your interest immediately and never let go.  What can I say about the DVD itself.  It's a dvd.  Quality transfer with good sound and a decent amount of extras.  Since I have no idea if we'll ever see it on Blu-Ray I decided to get the dvd while I still could.  Definitely worth purchasing and watching over and over again.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I loved the movie and the fact it came with a 3d disc,blue ray and regular disc. This is a great deal.
B00CRW2066|5.0|Describing The National's music in words, or listening to it in 90-second preview clips, is an impossible task.  Apart from Matt Berninger's baritone delivery, they don't have a lot of musically distinguishing features.  Only when you take the time to appreciate the album as a whole do you recognize the subtle cleverness of the lyrics, the psalm-like use of repetition, and musical conveyance of the song's meaning.  \\"Alligator\\" (2005) and \\"Boxer\\"(2007) were instant-classic indie rock albums about troubled relationships, life as a young professional, and the surprising isolation of life in a big city.  \\"High Violet\\" (2010) was a good album, but lacked the energy and focus of those earlier two masterpieces.<br /><br />\\"Trouble May Find Me\\" is an excellent album from start to finish, and with time, and may end up as some of The National's best work (time will tell).<br /><br />Lyrically, the album is beautiful, dark, profound, and absurdly hilarious all at the same time:<br /><br />\\"I'm trying, but I'm graceless<br />Don't have the sunny side to face this<br />I am invisible and weightless<br />You can't imagine how I hate this\\"<br />(Graceless)<br /><br />\\"I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park<br />You didn't see me I was falling apart<br />I was a television version of a person with a broken heart\\"<br />(Pink Rabbits)<br /><br />If you've never heard The National, check out \\"Alligator\\" and \\"Boxer\\" immediately.  If you like what you hear, there's more great music to be had in this latest release.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|This album is fantastic and beautifully unexpected. Daft Punk has broken out of the EDM mold of current sounds and really gotten back to what has always made them a stand out group: their mix of futuristic aesthetics and a foundation of retro 60s/70s. This album is a work of art, and I feel like I hear something new every time I listen to it.<br /><br />In regard to some of the Disappoint-Hate it's getting, I think some Daft Punk fans or EDM-fans that may not have been into Daft Punk before, but knew of them, were expecting a...well, expected EDM album. They wanted house-style thumping-bumping super electric wubwub glitchy music, but this album is so much smarter than that. RAM aesthetically sounds different than their last couple of albums, but it's classic Daft Punk and a total exploration of their core sound, which has always been retro funk. I applaud them for doing something that is inherently their style and true to their craft rather than something that will sell singles and be popular in the clubs.<br /><br />As a HUGE disco and Daft Punk fan, I think it's one of their best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of my favorite books I read this year. It is suspenseful, with lots of twists and turns.<br />I learned a lot about sociopaths.<br />I have recommended it a few times to friends and they too have enjoyed
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Overall, I found this to be an interesting story about a part of the Holocaust which I was unaware of. I wish the author would have spent more time on Sarah's story and less on Julia's martial problems, which I found distracting and annoying.<br />The novel is divided into two parts that switch back and forth. The first part tells the story of a family of French Jews who were taken to the Vel d'Hive and then deported to various work and concentration camps. The story then jumps forward to present day, where American journalist, Julia, is writing a piece on the round-up for a French tourism magazine (which now that I think about, seems a bit odd). While researching the Vel d'Hive, Julia discovers a dark secret in her husband's family which brings the past and present together.<br />There is also a movie, with Kristen Scott Thomas, that is as good, if not better, than the book, which would make this a great choice for a book club, or anyone with an interest in WWII and the Holocaust.
034580404X|5.0|The book is interesting at some point. Lot of repetitive scenes that make it boring after all. I read the first two pretty quick but didn't feel like reading the third one as fast.... I lost interest and motivation for knowing what would happen next.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Although you have to wade through much of Hugo's descriptions which is typical of literature from that era, the story line is wonderful.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A short but fascinating history of one of the most inventive scientists/technologists in the fields of electricity.  Now I want to learn more.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I have always thought there was something wrong with me for preferring my alone time.  I cringe at office parties and focused attention on me. I'm a very friendly caring nurse and instructor but I need my space.  This book explained slot of my habits and I feel a great sense of relief to know there are others like me.
B004HD61KE|3.0|I am a Rollins fan, but this one fell a little short of his earlier efforts.  The formula has sort of run its course.  I look forward to James starting a new storyline.  He is a quality writer of historical / adventure fiction and the rest of his stuff is four or five star.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The price is right even more so considering you get the digital copy to add to your online collection product is amazing
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|ive been waiting for awhile for this game to come to the kindle store. Nice to have it on a bigger screen.
B009MO57H6|5.0|the digital copy goes great for the online collection had no issues with the movie loved it thank you so much
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is my very favorite game to play! I am a senior citizen and this game keeps me entertained while I am waiting for appointments and even while I watch TV. It makes you competitive to get better scores each time you play it cause it awards you stars if you beat your last score. I have a Kindle Fire and it downloaded great with bright colors and sounds like an arcade game. Wonderful game!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I love it and the digital copy also goes great with my online collection had no issues at all. Ty
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great game that keeps me entertained. Even my 10 yr old granddaughter loves to play it. I have a Kindle Fire and it downloaded great.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|This being the fifth book in the series it definitely doesn't seem like it. Great story, copious amounts of depth both in characters, and plot. These books will be permanent additions to my library.
B00A6SZRGS|5.0|This band is all around amazing the message they send is beautiful. Had no issues with the product and the price is actually very reasonable
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It's a crazy story that pushed to the edges where I don't normally go stretching my boundaries. Thanks for making me blaze New trails
B005LAIIHG|5.0|What a great movie! Wonderful animal movie. Acting was good, the plot was great and the storyline was quite exciting. Watch this movie!

B008XKSW7M|4.0|Overall a funny, feel good, movie. Jennifer Lopez was great in her role and I liked the way the story was realistic in regards to fertility issues coupled with the fear that men have around fatherhood.

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Very dfficult to use.  It is suspose to be free - but you are charged for everything you need to play the game  It's a rip off.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I didn't feel like I wasted my time by watching this movie but it also wasn't one of those amazing movie experiences that sticks with you.<br /><br />I put this movie in the same category as movies like The Island, Gattica, or even Children of Men (dystopian or alternative futures) and I think this is just below par in that league.<br /><br />However, I can appreciate people who have read the book and thus are partial to the movie.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|You know that feeling you get after watching a great movie and you can't get it out of your head? This movie gives you that feeling. There are a few scenes typical to Nicholas Sparks, but it's much more riveting than usual. Definitely a &#34;must see&#34;.
B00A83075M|5.0|This movie is perfect for children and adults alike. There is something for everyone!! My five year old daughter absolutely loved it along with me and her dad! Highly recommend.
B000V39KDO|5.0|Being a Marine, we very closely identify with this film as we are considered modern day Spartans. Historically, the film is lacking. But for a true motivating kick, and understanding what true loyalty means as a brother-in-arms, this film hits the spot.... OOH-RAH!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The movie was good. It took a long time to download, may have been my connection. When the movie was almost over, it gave me an error, and I had to get a connection and go to streaming to watch the ending. I could not finish the downloaded version.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I got so wrapped up in this book that it remained in my thoughts during the day. I couldn't wait to continue reading. Loved it!
B00BGI08GG|5.0|This show is fantastic. My wife and I didn't follow the original comic, but we both love the show. It has a lot of depth and character development as well as telling a very compelling origin story of the Green Arrow character.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I do not want to spoil it for anyone, so I won't be too detailed. This is a must-watch movie. If are romantic and you want a feel good movie, this is one to watch. Great actors in the movie as well. Absolutely loved it. As far as Nicholas Sparks' movies, this is one of his best.
B005NQ94KS|3.0|I did'nt think the verbal part was very clear --soundwise<br />  also this picture was in the small format like back in the 80s
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My friends and co-workers encouraged me to watch this show, and I honestly thought they were crazy. Finally, I watched one episode - yes, one episode - and I got hooked. It's not all about the zombies. There is a lot more depth to this show than a bunch of zombies. It teaches one that material things are not everything and it demonstrates the strength that humans possess when trying to survive against horrific odds (although the apocalypse is unrealistic of course). It is just a show, but a good one!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the best game for free. You get to four wheel the the coolest places. You can go to the Forrest or just the highway. The fun awaits you. Get hill climb racing the best game for free.

B008N1V11U|4.0|This game plays a lot like the real Arkham City game not the android one.  Very good, voice acting is pretty solid, game play is fun.  I get a little frustrated with the camera in the game but I think that is kinda par for the course when it comes to tablet games.  I only paid .99 cents for it because it was on sale which was a steal.  I am not sure I would pay full retail price for it but then again I am hard pressed to pay more than five dollars for any game ever.  Anyway if you like Arkham City for x-box or pc, then you will most likely like this game as well.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I cried a lot over this kind of topic since I became a new mom.<br />It's just a little bit scary but full of love!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait for more...I absolutely loved this puzzle. Please hurry, as there aren't many things that entertain me! I have already told all of my friends about it.
B003BKF696|5.0|The first time I listened to High Violet I didn't really get it. The epic build of \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio\\" thrilled me but the rest of it felt bloated and slow, a mix of melancholy lyrics and brooding atmosphere. After repeated listens I began to warm up to the tracks and one by one they began to interest me. Yes, this record is dark and extremely unsettling in places. The National has never shied away from honesty and heavy themes; it's one of the elements that makes their music so engrossing and relatable. Songs like \\"Conversation 16\\", \\"Lemonworld\\", and \\"Sorrow\\" are as bleak as they come, yet that very depressing nature is what drew me in. This record came along during a difficult time in my life and these songs spoke to me. They don't hold anything back and sometimes you have to be willing to throw yourself out there, both as the artist and as the listener. In that regard The National always succeeds.<br /><br />This isn't the kind of music that will attract everyone. However, The National has never been about trying to appeal to the masses or to follow anyone's expectations. They make the kind of music they want and you're free to either come along for the ride or walk a different path. Hopefully everyone will give this a chance and let it wash over them. The emotions it brings to the surface may be uncomfortable but in the end that honesty is exactly what will keep you coming back. High Violet is arguably the group's finest hour and filled with compositions of the highest caliber. At this point I'd expect nothing less.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It's . Perfect in every way I absolutely love it and can't wait for the next ages it will be as great as the rest I'm sure you have done it again
B000OHZJKK|5.0|After scoring success with his debut album My Aim Is True, Elvis Costello wasted no time in recording a follow-up. This Year's Model takes everything that made his first album great and multiplies it several times over. The catchy melodies and intricate wordplay remain firmly intact but they're given an extra dose of energy by EC's famous backing band The Attractions, composed of Bruce Thomas on bass, Pete Thomas on drums, and Steve Nieve on keyboards. It's a firecracker combination that doesn't let up for even a second during the album's 39 minute duration.<br /><br />\\"No Action\\" opens the record with such intensity that it's almost exhausting just to listen to. Elvis begins by snarling, \\"I don't wanna kiss you, I don't wanna touch/I don't wanna see you 'cause I don't miss you that much.\\" Every member of the band comes in at full-throttle and it's a perfect slice of punk energy that demands your attention and leaves you feeling like you just stepped off a roller-coaster when it ends just two minutes later. I can't think of a better way to introduce The Attractions and it lets you know immediately that this album will be louder, rougher, and more intense than the first.<br /><br />The record contains a couple well-known hits, most notably \\"Pump It Up\\", which everyone has heard at some point. Even by today's standards it still sounds fresh and energetic, making it a well-deserved classic in Costello's vast catalogue. \\"Radio, Radio\\" was a controversial diatribe against corporate radio and its predictable \\"play it safe\\" attitude toward music, while \\"(I Don't Wanna Go to) Chelsea\\" rides a killer guitar riff that firmly ingrains it in your mind after just one listen. \\"The Beat\\" and \\"Little Triggers\\" are both prime slices of pop while \\"Hand in Hand\\" and \\"Lip Service\\" are trademark Costello songs whose dark lyrics are cleverly disguised by an upbeat melody. \\"Living in Paradise\\" is one of my favorites and finds Elvis in a state of jealousy and frustration before concluding, \\"You better have your fun before it moves along/And already you're looking for another fool like me.\\" Perhaps The Attractions' finest hour comes in the form of \\"Lipstick Vogue\\". Pete Thomas' drums open with a furious solo and intensity that only heightens as Steve's organ chimes in as the song blazes by with a punk ferocity that's impossible to ignore. Every track here is impressive and there's not a trace of filler or wasted space.<br /><br />It would have been hard for any artist to follow My Aim Is True and Costello took a big risk by going with a louder and more forceful sound. However, it works perfectly and there's no denying that The Attractions are a major key to this success. They take Costello's songs and elevate them to incredible heights. Each musician is amazingly skilled and they all get equal chances to shine here. If Costello's first album proved him to be a naturally-gifted songwriter then This Year's Model proved that he was here to stay and wasn't afraid to take his sound in new directions. His first album was stellar and this one, in my humble opinion, is even better. Don't miss it.\\"You better have your fun before it moves along/And already you're looking for another fool like me.\\" Perhaps The Attractions' finest hour comes in the form of \\"Lipstick Vogue\\".

159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a gifted storyteller. In his new novel, And the Mountains Echoed, his first in six years, he reminds readers why so many millions loved his earlier books, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.<br /><br />In And the Mountains Echoed Hosseini weaves a complex pattern of interlinked lives like a finely knotted carpet. This is a tale of separations, and of people searching for what they sense is missing. Parents get separated from their children. Brothers get separated from their sisters. Neighbours get separated from their friends. And at its heart, though much of the book takes place in Europe and the United States, And the Mountains Echoed is about the consequences of Afghans becoming separated from Afghanistan.<br /><br />There is an Afghan farmer so poor he is forced to sell his three-year-old daughter to a wealthy childless couple. There is the woman in Kabul who takes the girl hoping she will fill the void of her marriage. There is the girl herself who years later in Paris unscrambles nagging doubts about her origins with the unexpected help of a step-uncle she barely remembers.<br /><br />As each character moves from place to place, or from poverty to riches, or from humility to arrogance, all long to find their way back to what has been taken from them. Time slips back and forward, as readers move into the lives of the characters and each character leaves a mark on our hearts.<br /><br />Hosseini begins with the kind of moral-laden tale that master storytellers in our part of the world have crafted into an art form over the centuries. A horrific monster, a div with a horned head and a heavy tail, comes to a village to demand the sacrifice of a child. With every step the div takes, the earth shakes. The div randomly selects one house and instructs the family huddled within either to give him all their children, or to select one.<br /><br />In the end, they hand over their favourite son, whose name, like mine, is Qais. It is a wrenchingdecision, and its consequences echo through all the lives that Hosseini explores in this book.<br /><br />My mother used to tell us these kinds of stories. Though they sometimes terrified us, they also enthralled us, which was the whole point, as hundreds of rockets rained down around us every day in Kabul during the civil war that followed the Soviet occupation. The commanders of warring factions, like the div, fed their lust for power with the deaths of innocents. My mother's goal was to keep us distracted so we would not be frightened every time the earth shook from a nearby explosion.<br /><br />Like Hosseini and all great Afghan storytellers, she could keep a story going for days, exploring every possible corner of the lives of those who inhabited it, and kept us eager to hear what was coming next, even when, as in this book, we knew that parts of the story would be heartbreaking.<br /><br />When Hosseini writes about the old Afghanistan, before the civil war and the Taliban, his words are sweet, his sentences filled with the joy he knew there from his childhood. When he writes of the Afghanistan of today, his tone turns darker.<br /><br />And when he writes of the Afghans forced into new lives in other places, his storytelling carries an ache, even when the lives of the exiles turn out well. As the woman who was sold as a girl starts to remember her first years, she \\"feels a hole opening up in her. There has been in her life, all her life, a great absence. Somehow, she has always known.\\"<br /><br />Reconciliation with the past is never complete for these people. And their separate ways of dealing with that adds to their interest. One chooses suicide, another loyal servitude. One named Timur calls himself \\"Tim\\" in California.<br /><br />Even as these characters create new lives, they are always gripped by the past. Abdullah, an exile in California running a restaurant he calls Abe's Kabob House, explains to his American-born daughter why she must study Farsi:\\"if culture was a house, then language was the key to the front door, to all the rooms inside. Without it, he said, you ended up wayward, without a proper home or a legitimate identity.\\"<br /><br />If there is a weakness to And the Mountains Echoed, it is that Hosseini almost tries to tell too many stories. The result is that several intriguing characters get mentioned, then disappear. A girl name Roshi, orphaned and nearly killed during a family massacre, is adopted by a Bosnian nurse, recovers with the support of two Afghan-American cousins making their first visit back to Kabul, has a final enigmatic scene, and then is never mentioned again. Nor are the cousins, nor the nurse, except in passing.<br /><br />Even as it captures the sadness and regret that engulfs its characters' lives, Hosseini's storytelling is filled with love and joy and a deep sense of hope. And the Mountains Echoed is a deeply moving elegy to what might have been.<br /><br />I'm also an Afghan writer. My most recent book is A FORT OF NINE TOWERS: An Afghan Family Story, and I co-authored Shakespeare In Kabul in 2012.

B0078X2LKY|5.0|I loved this book 30 some odd years ago when I would read it over and over to my little brother.  He now has a 5 year old who loves to play on my kindle. I will enjoy sharing this book with her.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I am enjoying this game. I purchased it after finishing the free version. Glad I did! You will be too.
B007ZYJT1U|3.0|This movie was not overly interesting to me but it wasn't bad. If you like british movies I guess you will like this one.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Isaacson never attempted to sensationalize the Steve Jobs story, but presented facts through mulitple interviews (to get all points) and instense research. I found the history and the Jobs personality riveting. The story also gave me a greater appreciation for the Apple products and what goes into the design and engineering of a product. A must read for any user of Apple products -- or any one in business.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|As sweet novel told from a thoughtful dog's perspective, this is a charming story that brings hope out of sadness.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I broke down and purchased this book soley because of the upcoming movie. It was on all of the stands in the airport bookstores But I grabbed an electronic version for my iPad. I love it when an author takes a time-honored subject and comes at it from a completely new and unique perspective. This war is told as a collection of stories from survivors and what they went through. Basically, where were you when the zombies attack?
B00881PTRC|5.0|I read some reviews that made me think y this might be too easy, but I find that incorrect. With levels ranging from simple to SAT V I find no problem getting a  challenge. Funny that it's the four letter words that hang you! Now that I have &quot;_ole&quot; does it start with a d,h,m,p,r,s,t,v? So that's enough to hang you. So its challenging and amusing enough. Great in the line at the bank. Learned some new words and good brain exercise. Recommended.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The book was beautifully written, although sometimes getting bogged down in detailed descriptions.  Wonderful story; lots of characters and an interesting ending.

B004H1V5RU|3.0|My husband and kids love the classic Perpluxus toy. So I got this one for a challenge. But it's a little too hard for my 13 yr old who finds it frustrating.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|wasn't my favorite.  Subject has been beat into the ground.  Reads like an old novel where everything that happens is so far fetched.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This novel is a masterpiece, a delightful read.  The setting is Ulster (Northern Ireland) in 1974, particularly in a pair of villages in County Derry.  The dialogue is perfect Ulster, which is no surprise since the author was raised there.  I found myself \\"reading aloud in my head\\" to the dialogue, and I could recognize a lot of my Ulster friends' voices!  The scenes in the orphanage are heart-breaking.  Many of Jamie McCoone's scenes are side-splitting, as his painful shyness leads to absolutely comical scenes---in the breakfast room of a resort, in a clothing store buying a suit, in the men's room (!).  His character is well-drawn, as are Rose and Paddy, the occupants of the next farm.  Again, I feel as though I know those folks!  The ending is a heart-warming surprise.  Highly recvommended.
B001TJQMVW|5.0|hadn't read it in years - loved it even more now. these little women knew a lot that modern women canlearn from
1476733953|5.0|I really liked this book, and though at first glance it seems like Fallout set in the Vaults, it actually stands on its own and is not formulaic at all.  I really couldn't tell how it would end until it did.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes the post-apocalyptic genre to pick up this book.
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|Avoid this app,<br />All the reviews are crap<br />Just a word to the dad,<br />This app is really bad.<br />Seems this review needs more words,<br />Just stick with &quot;Angry Birds&quot;.
B001DJLCRC|1.0|The story line and the presentation offends my moral semsibilities. The product was in good physical condition -- but I trashed it after viewing two episodes.
1616960922|5.0|I have to admit I am an avid reader.  The book was a little depressing when I received it.  I was expecting a lot more pages.  To be completely honest, even though I read it in an hour or two, it was completely fascinating.  Sanderson is one of my favorite authors and he did a great job of hooking us and pulling us into this world.  Even though it was a quick read, he didn't end it in a cheap or boring way either.
B00BY8DC2A|5.0|I have been a fan since the beginning. Over the years, there have been different lead vocalists with different degrees of success. It's great to hear N'dea and the band sounding fresher that ever. The first single, \\"Sunlight\\" is going to be my go to hit for the summer of 2013. Other great tracks include One the One and Turn The Music Up. Enjoy! I love this band. Hope to see a US tour soon. They would be amazing live.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|good old Jane! you can always depend on her for a good story.the language and manners are fascinating.I enjoy all of her books.
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|I was frankly disappointed in this film. I  think the material was there but it wasn't done well. It's not bad, but it just feels like it was done in a rush, without any polish.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It's a great addition to my Kindle Fire.  I was able to import all of my email list, and can use it wherever I can access WiFi.  It's great on vacations.  Works well.  No problems as yet.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|The story seems to go very slowly -- but the time-lapse sequences build step-by-step real horror. The included alternative ending is too ghastly for words.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Rare is the written history that one cannot put down, and this is one.  Superbly written, thoroughly researched, and brings to the fore a brief period of previously poorly understood events.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Please read this book. You will not regret it. Guess I will have to watch the movie now
0385341008|5.0|I didn't realize the history of Guernsey Island in WWII nor did I know what those people went through. It's a brave and entertaining book.
193700788X|1.0|This book has no plot to speak of and every single character is acting out of character. Bottom line is, if you are a SVM fan then just let the series end with book 9, maybe 10. There is nothing to be gained from reading this \\"ending\\" other than complete anger at the author so obviously selling out and flipping off her fans.<br /><br />This is my 10th review of DEA and I am just exhausted from trying to explain to Charlaine Harris fans exactly why people are upset. It has nothing to do with the HEA and everything to do with how it got there. She has phoned in the last 3 books and this is the worst one yet.
B0011Z5CV0|5.0|He's almost 1.5 and still plays with it every day.  Definitely a good find for any budding musician. Love it
B004EPYZQC|5.0|If your formula works, why change it, remember new Coke?  (if you do, you are as old as I am and probably too old for fast and furious movies, heh)  Like number 4 this 5th movie puts the right group together, gives them something to do in some really pretty toys and then blows stuff up, fast.  So much car porn in these movies, but add a bit of story and you have something that is great to have on in the background when you are hanging out with the guys in the man cave, be it basement or garage.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use it frequently. Does a very good job. I particularly like the range of information available and use this feature frequently./
B000FC0V3E|5.0|An amazing work from a so-called &#34;simpler time&#34; which wasn't simple in any way. Lean, hard prose with an edge all the way through.
B006OB3K56|5.0|This is not a sexy movie; but it is about sex...sex as addiction, sex as compulsion, sex as the thing that eats you up and has the power to destroy.  The plot is a slow unravelling of the main character, Brandon, brilliantly played by Michael Fassbender, when his younger sister, Sissy pushes her way into Brandon's seemingly ordered and tightly controlled life.  What caused the family dysfunction isn't revealed, but is played out in the relationship of brother and sister; their pain more evident as they begin to spin out of control.  Director Steve McQueen does a wonderful job in nuance, atmosphere, and restraint.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|if you like killing and goals to shot for this is for you. it's kind of like fate for those who know

B001ANSSDC|3.0|Based on the trailer for the movie I was expecting more of a love story. This was more about mental illness and football. I understand the title refers to a playbook but it seemed that it was only a play on words.
B005PK58TI|1.0|The first episode was compelling, and I found myself wanting to watch another episode after each one ended as the story became more and more multi-layered. The problem was that this turned into a Columbine revenge wish-fulfillment fantasy very quickly, and I am glad that, from reading the reviews, I am not the only one who noticed this and found it inappropriate on several levels.  As it nears the end of the season, it changes from being fascinating and labyrinthine to being outright ludicrous, with the final episode becoming downright wacky and embarrassing and feels like a strangely compelling horror drama has suddenly and inexplicably become a rather bizarre and absurd comedy. My apologies to whoever is reviewing the reviews, but I don't want to give details for fear of spoiling, not that there is much to spoil.<br /><br />Funny thing was that it was the weirdness of the story that kept me watching at first and kept me clicking on the next one and the next one, and not the main characters who I found remarkably unappealing (especially the father, Ben, who struck me as a sub-par psychiatrist with an attitude towards his patients that seemed more fitting of a disinterested minimum wage fast-food worker and not someone who is trying to gain the trust of suffering people--he seems to hold them in active contempt, the reason for which becomes apparent at the end, where you get the \\"moral\\" of the story, and I find it amazing that I am expected to like this character and regard him as a hero).  I got a kick out of the daughter, Violet, but mostly because of the actress's hilariously snarky way of delivering lines and not so much out of the character herself.<br /><br />I'm not too interested in reading about or watching anyone's Mary Sue wish-fulfillment fantasy to begin with, but revenge fantasies are even worse. We all have our wish-fulfillment fantasies, but it's bad form to write them out and inflict them on the world at large.  I gave it two stars instead of one only because the initial handful of episodes were interesting enough to keep me watching, but since it went downhill into a personal revenge fantasy very quickly, I can't honestly give it anything better.  If you don't mind revenge fantasies, you'll love this because it is genuinely weird and labyrinthine in terms of general plot.  I might watch season 2 since it seems to involve an entirely new situation and characters, and I really hope it will be as fascinating as this series, but without the puerile revenge fantasy to ruin it.<br /><br />EDIT:  I have changed the stars from 2 to 1, based on this excellent review by another Amazon reviewer: http://www.amazon.com/review/R877GIEVOOTLJ/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAJ1O0&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=.  I have to admit that this person has zeroed in on some of the things that have been grating me without me being able to put my finger on them, and a lot of the seemingly compelling and labyrinthine elements of the series are simply a trick of the way they decided to present a mashup of some remarkably unoriginal ideas as an original series.

B004EPYZUS|5.0|The is a much better story, a lot more like I was expecting since the first one hit the scene.  It is a team movie with some gadgets that have their own little quirks.  The action is good and over the top and Mr. Cruise is holding up very well, though I am not sure I’d watching him slide across the floor singing in his underwear (who am I kidding, I would) the action is tight and well done.  Charming and smart it is a good sequel that a lot of the 4’s and 5’s have been as of late.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|There are too many dangling story lines here to call this a satisfying read. I expected more and if there is a sequel in the works I hope the authors remember their fans enjoy the way they used to weave the story together.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|Although I feel this strange, non-existent obligation to review everything I buy.<br /><br />I really enjoy Vampire Weekend's music and this album was different than previous two in a good way. I've been listening to Diane Young over and over.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Nothing more that a promotion for the author's other books.  Text is boring - nothing like thhat published in the synopsis.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I wish Dexter was not in its final season. I will miss it terribly!!!!  My Dexter set is the only one I own.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This show just gets better. The acting is incredible, the storyline gets better. Breaking Bad is simply outstanding.<br />This is probably my favourite season of them all so far. The picture quality and sound are both great. In fact, I cannot fault this blu ray at all.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|This is your usual Father and son movie.  Dad is a bit of a dead beat, the boy is angry for the usual reasons.  The father has lost sight of things important to him and the son is here to show him the way with a little robot that could.  No huge surprises in this one but a good watch if you think Mr. Jackman is a BAMF and you like science fiction tales over science fantasy.  The robots were not over the top and the better part of the world looks like ours.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I think one of the best components of the game are the sound effects and the music.  Its very playable and intuitive on my nexus phone. Its a great game.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is the hast game I have ever played in my life! definitely worth the download!you should get it- no doubt!
B00CW665VI|5.0|REVIEWED FOR: Sinfully Sexy Book Reviews<br /><br />5+ Stars!!<br /><br />Tangled is absolute hilarity and one of the most purely enjoyable reading experiences I've had in quite a long time!!<br /><br />This story is told from Drew Evans' point of view, a man's point of view, and let me tell you, I think this is possibly the most honest male point of view I've read...maybe ever. At least, when it comes to women and being a player. When we first meet this guy, he is arrogance personified, absolutely disgusting in myriad ways, and almost unknowingly disrespectful toward most women. And...somehow? I found him hysterical!  Drew is ALL sorts of discombobulated when he meets the new employee his father hired, a woman he tried to pick up in a bar not long before, the brilliant and lovely Kate Brooks. He's strongly attracted, but he also doesn't sleep with co-workers. They strike sparks off one another on a daily basis, and their bickering is as amusing as their chemistry is sizzling.  There are changes in store for both of these highly intelligent, competitive and strong-willed individuals, and there are lessons to be learned. It's that age-old question of love conquering all.<br /><br />I think what I wound up loving most about Tangled was the combination of raw honesty from a male point of view, the sheer brains, strength and vulnerability of Kate's character, and the humor to be found in very real-life situations. It certainly didn't hurt that Drew was sexy!! Wow! Did I ever end up falling for this egotistical player! I also loved that, while his humor could be crass, the author never let it get over the top. One can have too much of a good thing. Plus...well, just between you and I, fantastic groveling in this book *wink*.<br /><br />Emma Chase. I don't know where this author has been, but please continue writing for the rest of my lifetime. Okay?! Great, thanks! Let me tell you, I am one hard-to-please person to begin with, but, when it comes to humor? Oooh. I can be ugly. No joke. It takes true, true, honest talent to write humor well, and Emma Chase has it. But, even aside from the humor, this author writes with a flow and pacing, with a `voice', with a style...honestly, she writes like a seasoned pro. There is a level of quality and ability here that is rare with new authors. Really...what I actually want to say? I heart you, Emma Chase. You rocked my LOL right off the charts, woman!!<br /><br />Tangled will make you laugh until, frankly, you pee a little and your sides ache. Tangled will ignite your girly bits. Best of all,Tangled will make you super d@mn happy!! Go get it! Now! I see you sitting there, considering, weighing the pros and cons...blah, blah, blah. NO, NO, NO. Go. Buy. Now. And, when you're done reading, leave a review of your own wherever you buy it, please. It makes a difference, and I know you'll feel inspired to do it once you've read this stellar book!ugly. No joke. It takes true, true, honest talent to write humor well, and Emma Chase has it. But, even aside from the humor, this author writes with a flow and pacing, with a `voice', with a style...honestly, she writes like a seasoned pro.

B005FISBTO|5.0|I wish Dexter was not in its final season. I will miss it terribly!!!!  My Dexter set is the only one I own.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Although I previously stated that season 3 was my best season so far, in fact, season 4 is.<br />It had me glued to my seat. Once again, as in all the previous seasons, the acting is superb. It is beautifully shot, with lots of close ups and plenty of emotion to keep you hooked until the final episode.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I love westerns, sci-fi, Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, the thought of aliens and cowboys sounded as strange as it did awesome.  Soon as I heard that they were mixing those two together and it was being done by Jon Favreau my expectations went past anything it could have attained.  I saw it in the theaters and was happy but not like fan boy crazy and was only let down by my expectations not being met.  The characters are good and it is better in a second viewing.  Worth seeing if you like any of the parts I mentioned, in my opinion of course.
B00A3XQVKW|3.0|It's was very interesting  to read about  her very personal experience . I enjoyed the book.  Thank you u u
B002WY66FA|4.0|The vinyl qulaity is very good. The album is great moody stuff. Hope's voice is as beautiful as it was on &#34;She hangs brightly&#34; but there's nothing more up tempo than &#34;Fade Into You&#34;
0374533571|4.0|I started to enjoy this story almost as soon as I began reading it.  Silver Linings Playbook is a fast read, and it is very easy to get into.  The only drawback for me was not knowing why Pat had ended up in a mental facility.  It almost seemed there was a bit of brain damage, the way he was so childlike and unknowing of the world around him and of passing time.<br /><br />The characters in this book draw you in and make you root for them to succeed. Pat is working very hard on \\"being kind, not right\\".  The relationships in this book are touching, messy, and feel real.  I love the way Pat interacts with his mother and brother, who are there for him and help him.  Pat and his Dad, though, have a very difficult relationship, and the fact that it is not all cleared up and perfect at the end makes it even better.  I think, perhaps, the character that really stayed with me was Tiffany.  In Tiffany, we see how grief can truly rip a life apart, and the wonder of the human spirit, to fight to come back from despair.<br /><br />I loved this book.  It was a little darker than I had anticipated.  I am looking forward to discussing it for my local bookclub next week.<br /><br />I posted this and other reviews at my blog- http://turnthepagereviews
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Artistic, chilling, thoughtful and yet shocking.<br /><br />This show is an awesome watch.  Must See TV.  Its ratings are likely due in part to its place in a Thursday lineup where it does not belong.  Very few people want to watch sitcoms followed by a dark and thoughtful show involving crime and its horrific face disguised by a veneer of gentile appearance.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|This was a Christmas Gift for my brother. He likes this type of book or DVD. He liked the previous actor that played Jason Bourne better.
B0000640SB|5.0|Sci Fi and comedy come together in a well done story about a secret government-like group of alien police that are aging and in need of recruits.  Will Smith is that new recruit and Tommy Lee is the older would be mentor.  It is a buddy pic with a heart and a good summer popcorn movie that still holds up pretty well today.  There is a number 2 that isn’t as good as this one but they really got it right with number 3.
B003JHKORK|5.0|Movie is very good for audiences of all ages except maybe the very young. We hope for movies of the entire series of the books.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|If he wanted to do a western, he should've done a western.  The civil war era south is not the place for six-shooters and lever action rifles.  Jamie Foxx is impersonal and stiff.  He did a good impression of Ray Charles but I wish we could stop pretending he's a great actor.  My distaste for him aside, if it wasn't for brilliant performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L Jackson, this movie would be rated much lower by me.  Leo is chilling.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I had to remove this twice and re-download it due to it freezing up my Kindle and having to shut down the kindle and restart it using the 30 second hold on the start button and hooking it up to the charger. I permanently removed it. KI liked playing it, but not when it messes up the Kindle.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I wasn't so sure when I first received it. The watch is made in Malaysia so my expectations of typical Seiko quality was immediately lowered, Then on the second day of wearing it one of the pins holding the band popped out. This happened on a fire scene while I was fighting a wildland fire, so I wasn't super critical of the strength of the pin. I just thought that maybe it wasn't tough enough for that type &#34;abuse&#34;. However, I found that the pin was still retained inside the band, and it is a large, beefy pin. I think that the spring post had not fully engaged into the hole in the watch case. I put the pin back in and made sure it was locked into place and it has been fine ever since. I've put it through some pretty strenuous activity since then and the watch has kept perfect time and has not had an issue with pins popping out since then. I probably should rate it 4 stars because of the problem with the pin, but I really do love this watch and I couldn't be more pleased with it.
B00C7O8P90|5.0|\\"Love Lust Faith + Dreams\\" is great! This is another great album from Jared Leto and his brother Shannon's band, 30 Seconds To Mars. This is also a great rock album as well. All (12) tracks on here are great and interesting.<br /><br />Track Listing<br />1. Birth (3 1/2 out of 4 stars)<br />2. Conquistador (4 out of 4 stars)<br />3. Up In The Air (4 out of 4 stars)<br />4. City Of Angels (4 out of 4 stars)<br />5. The Race (4 out of 4 stars)<br />6. End Of All Days (4 out of 4 stars)<br />7.

B000IDGBWU|5.0|if you grew up in the awesome 80s you can't help but love it.<br />nobody puts baby in a corner!
1423113462|5.0|Amazing! Now my patience will be tested as I wait for more in the series. Bring them on quick. I'm failing the test.
B00BHMF578|3.0|It was okay, and only just.  It's a great story, but not a great movie.  The editing is pretty awful and fails at maintaining any sort of suspense.  It's got a good visual impact, though, and the acting is above par across the board.  Who doesn't love Alan Arkin?  I expected more, and perhaps that's why I didn't enjoy it.  It's certainly a step down from Ben's previous directorial projects.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Was entertaining...worth the rental but wouldn't buy it...love Wahlberg and he played a great role in it...can't say much else without ruining/giving away the movie suspense... ;)
B002UM5BXW|5.0|If you love Bourdain' s style of demeaning dry humor, you will love this book. A interesting insight into the restaurant industry.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This was as good as the original, probably better than the ones in-between.  Josh Brolin was very convincing as the younger Agent K.  I recommend this one in your DVD library.
B00B23O96A|1.0|These songs are some of Eric's favorites but certainly not mine.  I bought it without listening to samples here first and made a mistake.  He has made so many albums that he is at the point that he has to please himself and I understand that.  For me though I probably won't listen to it again.  There were a few brilliant guitar riffs that I loved but not many.  For me, Eric is a guitarist first and I expect him to challenge himself by playing with other guitarists who inspire him to play to his potential.<br /><br />My excitement at the check out counter while purchasing this in anticipation of listening was high but was let down far and fast half way through.  I love Clapton and wait for the 2013 Crossroads DVD to blow me away.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I at first loved the second song: Its A Beautiful Day.  Then I find I am repeating the song I've Got It Easy.  Its<br />fantastic.  Don't get me wrong they are all good, but those 2 especially.  My daughter just moved further away from my home and the drive is so much more enjoyable listening to Michael.  Thanks Michael!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie covers a serious and hard topic with some humor and love. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are great together.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am not typically one to play online games. I prefer games like Solataire or Soduko. I happened happened across across this game and got it with my children in mind. When I decided to look at it before allowing my children to play, I was hooked. I like how this game does not demand a lot of your time, as I do not have a lot of time to play games. It is perfect to help me unwind for a few minutes throughout the day as I have the time.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Great game filled with challenges and rewards. Character customization and fun animations are just part of the action. Every part of the game is fun and enjoyable. I love it and know u will too.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This one works well, so far. Usually don't have much time to use it on my Kindle Fire HD tablet, and this doesn't get wifi when I'm out and about. However, if I find myself settling in at home for longer periods of time, I do use it, and recommend it.  This requires a connection to the Internet when using.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin makes you believe this is a historical novel that could have happened in real life. HBO has brought the Game of Thrones to life, and the books define it.  Well done!!!!!
B00C8USQEM|3.0|The volume is poor. The first two seasons were fine but the 3rd season(haven't gotten to the rest) I have to have my volume on double the normal. Also, there is nothing in the description that states it's the version released in the UK.
0439023513|4.0|Spoiler spoiler.......<br /><br />Love how Suzanne can incredibly reccount every sentence with vivid pictures and continuing heat from the start to finish.<br /><br />After I finished reading all three books in one row, I went a bit confused, amazed and sad. The ending had afflicted me for 2 days like some other readers I assumed. Almost all of the characters in the book especially did not end like we wished, especially Katniss, my very loved, faorite character before Petta, seemed to carry out such a sorrowful life afterward. I guessed that she would suffer from and endure pain and grivance after what she had gone through a terrible experiences from her the  death of her dad, her painstaking effort to keep her family surviving even to sacrifice herself, going to Hunger game, losing those whom she love, care for and seeing them suffering and a lot more. And she was naturally so self-destruction that is not her false but nature of humans, she got worse to worse since she thought she was the cause of many deaths but she appeared to forget that she was one who bringe light to many people to freedom and the end of crule government, Snow.<br />  I agreed with many other reviewers that it might be a chance that she was the victim of war or all bloody killing. But what did not seem fair at all in my eye was that why not many people came to help her, cheer poor Katniss up or claim her some credit for what she had done for them. It should be a big celebration for her to tell her that all she had done is greatness and goodness. On the contrary no one seemed to be interested in Mockeybird after the revolution. Her mother, her friends and her colleagues should have helped her better than that.<br />  After all it was just a imaginary story. Hopefully we, readers, dont get too emotional on it.
B008476HBM|5.0|I am an older dude. If you are a &#34;connoisseur of human folly&#34;, this book is for you. True, it is a love story -- but it is more than that. Jane Austen uses her characters as various modes of exploration of the dimensions in human interactions and perceived judgements and the folly resulting thereof.  The witticisms bantered back and forth are absolutely stunning. The best is by far the garden dialog between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine de Bourgh (you must read &#34;Lady Catherine de Bourgh&#34; in the melodic, over dramatized voice of Mr Collins in the BBC 5 hr miniseries on Pride and Prejudice).<br /><br />The dialog never bores and the depth of character development is unsurpassed. Jane Austen is rightly said to be second only to Shakespeare on insights into the human psyche.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|DRAW INFINITY is a GOOD CANVAS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.<br /><br />One of my passions is painting, yet it is the one thing I never have time to do due to my busy schedule. This app is giving me an instant outlet for my creative process. It is not easy to use, yet that is part of the challenge. I love the feature that  allows you to  enhance your final work.
B007SUW24W|5.0|I love every song on the cd. Ed Sheeran's music and lyrics are so soulful and witty. I haven't been this excited over a cd in a long time.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|One of the top TV shows ever made, in my humble opinion. This I highly recommend to any entertainment fan.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So epic I loved every second! Best trilogy I have read so far. Suzanne Collins should write allot more  books.
B00555X8OA|2.0|more social and pseudoscience babble.....I hope the author did not use taxpayer money for this project<br />Save your money, guys !
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is super duper fun but be careful friends, because you will probably get very addicted just like I have!!!
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This amazingly quirky yet powerful movie is a joy to see.  You can't find a better cast.  The young people are outstanding.  To me, another great character in the film is the score by Mr. Desplait.  I haver the soundtrack and never get tired of it.  Be sure together the musical gift at the end of the credits.  If you are a boomer,you will especially like this wonderful movie.  As I recall Roger Ebert put it at the top of his list for last year.
1932100660|5.0|I was taking expensive meds for my cholesterol, but not anymore.  I am now stable at 170-180 down from 250, and all I did was change my diet according to this book's recommendations - no exercise or meds at all, and I also lost 20 lbs in the process. This not only explains what you should (or shouldn't) eat, but WHY, and HOW the typical American diet is killing us with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.  Dr. Campbell does an excellent job of cutting through the bull, and getting down to the facts - the real facts, not those from pseudo-scientific studies funded by the various food groups that have an obvious conflict of interest.  If you read one book this year, make it this one.  It will change your life.  And if you read two books, add the corresponding cookbook written by his wife.  My wife and I have tried a dozen recipies so far, and we like them all.  I'm especially fond of the sweet-potato enchiladas - excellent!!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie - have shared it with everyone I know.  It is funny and touching.  After watching it I couldn't stop talking about it and my daughter and I shared so many laughs from the movie.  The music is also great!!!!! I bought it immediately after renting it.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|we're really fans of director Joss Weedon.  Great science fiction action, strong female characters and a great love story too.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|There are many flashlight apps out there but this one is the one to have.<br /><br />It manages to give the features you need without a load of superfluous accessories that only hog resources. Never be without a flashlight again as long as you have your Kindle  and this essential app.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|Reading Eat Pray Love was like reading Liz Gilbert's personal journal. A lot of insight, humor, and compassion, this book brings to perspective some of the more important things in life.<br /><br />A good, easy read, Eat Pray Love is compelling. Give it a chance if you're on the fence.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|Great voice! Thank you Amazon for getting it to me swiftly.  I cant wait to listen to the full songs rather than clips of the songs.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent acting and a very good story line. I enjoyed it and kept my interest right up to the end.
B000Q67876|5.0|Me encanta esta pelicula. Mas alla del buen guión con el que cuenta, las actuaciones de Tim Robbins y Morgan Freeman son perfectas. Definitivamente es una de esas peliculas que tenes que ver antes de morir.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie.  Two of my five grandsons are autistic, and this movie helps me to understand them.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is an essential app for monitoring and maintaining the health of your Kindle battery. I used the free version for several weeks and am so impressed that I bought the Pro version just to make sure some money got to the developers. I would gladly have paid double the amount I did.<br /><br />This Pro version has features that will blow you away. Ironically, I have seen other battery monitors that are resource hogs. This one is not.<br /><br />From the practcal to the aesthetic, this app has it all. It even allows you to change the color of the battery icon on it's report screen. That might seem trivial, but it just goes to show how considerate the developers are. I am looking for more apps from these developers; they are trult the best.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|Swivel feature is great. Sturdy and nice looking makes it worth the price. Only drawback for me is the prop-up feature; no positive set positioning can be irksome. Overall nice product.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I don't particularly like this game because I (maybe I'm stupid) but I'm stuck.  I've put it aside until I feel like I can tackle it when<br />I feel better and have the patience to deal with it.  I would not recommend this game to anyone else.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my 3rd Seiko watch in 28 years. The other 2 watches are working fine still....they require a battery. I have not had much wearing time on this one to give a accurate review,but if it is as reliable as my others ,  I am sure it will serve well. The band is comfortable and the face is easy to read. It is nice enough to wear as a semi dress type watch.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I loved Alias and was excited to see something else by this same producer. I have only started watching Fringe, but already I'm intrigued!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Waiting is made easier, helps pass the time.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who is impatient as me.<br />Play it daily
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Intriguing characters and setting.  One way too deal with after war devastation, and how surviving humans can become more humane.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|started watching this on the treadmill in the mornings & ended up blowing through the episodes - found myself wiki'ing Henry VIII and his wives to check the history, totally addictive. And the man candy can't be beat!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not what I expected but it surpassed those expectations. If you can read this book and not question your own morality and humanity then you really didn't read it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very awesome show! I have two young children and I can't wait for them to go to bed at night so I can tune in to the next episode of Downton Abbey! Seeing some things come to fruition in this season are great as well as some unexpected character developments has made watching this show a plus.<br />Not to mention the stunning cinematography of this show. I bought it in HD and some of the scenes are so breathtaking. So glad I bought it!
B009QU9X44|5.0|A great book - definitely a pleasure to read. This third novel clearly shows a certain maturity in Adichie's writing style.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I rated this 'cause it's fun to play.<br />I like the challenge it offers.<br />I'd tell all my friends, try this one.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Some of the best written songs I've heard in years....especially Sandrevan Lullaby and Cause. This man is great! Sixto Rodriguez and Will Johnson are the two best song writers out there today.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Still love me my Michael Buble, but this just isn't my favorite album of his. Not bad, but not a favorite.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is one of my favorite games. I purchased this for my boyfriend as a gift. He was soooo happy! Its easy to learn and easy to play. It can be a short or a long game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was introduced to pinterest from my friend and I am absolutely addicted...im constantly looking for who knows what just something...always something new and exciting to look forward to !
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. Oddly enough, Anne Hathaway was my least favorite character despite the fact that she won an oscar for it.
B00CBRADU2|4.0|I thought it was a very entertaining movie and Arnold<br />seems to still have good energy in his acting.  It was<br />better than I expected.
B0083ZRAJS|2.0|watch the move, don't waste your time with the book.  Maybe a little more backstory for the characters, but unless you really want to read all the other books, the movie is better.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is one of the more interesting games I've seen on mobile devices. It combines a match three puzzle game with a retro type adventure game. I highly recommend it!
B0015AARJI|3.0|The remote still works, but the left toggle switch sticks in the up position. Its ok, and it still works, so I like it lol
B003VR5PPY|4.0|Let me get this out of the way: I'm very glad I bought and played this game. It felt like a breath of fresh air from popular modern gaming.<br /><br />That being said, this game is not for everyone. It might even be generous to call this title a \\"game.\\" 999 is much more of a visual mystery novel with a few choose-your-own-path parts thrown in. The puzzles are not that difficult. Everything serves the narrative. I read a lot, so I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I have two complaints;<br /><br />1 - Considering how some DS titles offer 80 hours of rpg gameplay, there's not a whole lot of animation and effects in this game. It mostly consists of little anime side bars similar to the tales series of games, the ones that would happen randomly to build character relationships. So...it's hard not to feel a little cheated there.<br /><br />2 - There are multiple endings and you can't even get the good one on your first play-through. Now, I found the \\"pre-requisite\\" ending and all the eerie story hints that set you up for the final play-through, but I must admit that it would have taken me 15 play-throughs minimum to figure out the choices you would have to make to get the \\"true\\" ending. I had to look it up after the 4th bad ending.<br /><br />Still, if you love to read or really dig narrative based games, this one is very recommended.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I assumed that this phrase &#34;Ad-Free&#34; meant that no adds would show up. Well I am wrong and i get too many adds.
1742200508|5.0|excellent guide for traveling England.  Complete with maps, colored coded for easy reference.  Details places to sight-see, restaurants, and hotels / motels for lodging.  Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Zounds, this is such good viewing. You feel like you are part of the group. You come to know and like or dislike the characters. Can't get enough of this.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|This album has some of the best and memorable hits from Led Zeppelin. There are good fast songs, good slow songs, and everything in between.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting book. Has some weird twists but you get sucked in and cannot stop reading to see what happens next.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love it but some things can be changed. maybe some more popular or funnier games. but other than that it is really fun
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I know it was free but it has way to many adds. It really takes away the fun of it.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|******Everyone Seems to have FINALLY caught on to \\"Breaking Bad.\\"  You wouldn't be reading this review unless you needed a copy; be it for to see it again, archival, or Gifting. if you skip this review, do yourself (AND ME, LOL) a favor and skip all the way down to the last bullet point before you move on...<br /><br />***** I'm sorry, ****PLEASE READ A DIFFERENT REVIEW**** if you are looking for a review of characters,  plots, or screenplay, etc. This review applies ONLY to the DVD format of the Complete Fourth Season (and also to all of the Complete Seasons that are available to stream, which I have.<br /><br />* These are DVD's of the shows as they originally aired, in what i call \\"TV Widescreen, which is really 1080P,\\" at the original 44 minutes per episode with NO advertising whatsoever. There are some previously \\"unseen\\" scenes, on Many Seasons, but the deleted scenes are shown later in the Bonus Material, as Deleted scenes, and not in a \\"Director's Cut\\" type of format. There are a fair amount extras too.  When i say \\"Fair\\", I mean it's \\"Probably\\" NOT ENOUGH for the SuperFan, and probably too many for the average Joe/Jane, and will never be watched.  I don't believe there is a different version available.  What a tragedy.  Often, the Bonus Material after a show Gives Major Insights into said show.The Bonus material chosen for this DVD release is of High-Quality.  There could have been MORE, but I'm comparing an under-funded, well-run, \\"Expertly\\" casted, Amazingly Acted, runaway Late-Night Cable TV drama, that \\"Took a chance\\" with it's viewing demographic, and is REAPING the rewards... to a BlockBuster Motion Picture, and their 9-figure budgets. Bravo AMC!<br /><br />* I love all my physical copies of movies (And TV shows. I still have ACTUAL working BetaMax tapes...AND...a player.  It is used about once per 10 years.  Every different format of a movie has different characteristics, strengths, weaknesses. We have had MANY \\"Top Quality\\" VHS (& Beta) movies thatthe DVD transfer went horribly wrong. I'm talking about the re-release that THE STUDIO did, and not a copy on my home equipment!!! Some have been fixed.  Some haven't.  Some of these major issues never get addressed at all, and a re-mastered Blu-Ray is your only choice to get a decent copy, but with this Series, That Is Not The Case! (I'm speaking of \\"other\\" shows and films, NOT this one!) Some have been cut, and re-formatted for the old shape TVs.  Hey, no laughter, Some people still HAVE & USE at lease 1 of those (Including my bedroom and guest room).<br /><br />* This DVD Release IS A GOOD ONE! The transfer went well, and for my \\"Personal Taste\\", there is no need AT ALL for me to OWN a Blu-Ray copy of this type of a TV Series, especially just a single season, for a much higher price tag than a DVD played through an up-convert player (that will Look and sound virtually identical on every system in the house, from the lowliest one in the basement workshop, to the \\"5-figure\\" Entertainment System in your main Theater. *****Yes, a Blu-Ray will actually look and sound better than an \\"up-converted\\" standard DVD, but since this isn't a big special effects Action Movie, I assure you, the difference between an up-converted DVD and a Blu-Ray is \\"Negligible in this type of situation, unless you happen to have an absurdly large TV such as a 100 Inch HD Projector.\\"<br />Many \\"TV\\" Shows fall under this category \\"For Me.\\"  I want to own a \\"quality\\" copy of the ENTIRE SERIES; EVERY SEASON, as they are released; and I'm NOT willing to wait for the entire series to be released in a boxed-set, at even HIGHER prices...ESPECIALLY If I had not seen the series yet. (That is the most important thing.  Start, or continue watching Breaking Bad, and all the other cool programming that AMC has given us for many years now.<br /><br />* This is a straight digital transfer and looks ALMOST EXACTLY as it was originally aired (depending on your player (up-converting dvd or Blu-Ray, and also on the quality of the  original Cable, Satellite, or digital \\"air\\" broadcast. The original might not have been shot in HD, and unless the studio \\"Re-Mastered yet AGAIN, for HD, then owning a blu-ray of this season ALONE makes absolutely ZERO SENSE. The exceptions i find \\"acceptable although unnecessary\\" include that you or the person you are buying for ALREADY have started your or their collection in the Blu-Ray Format, and you want to keep consistent with the little blue boxes and not the slightly bigger black ones. WHO'S IDEA WAS IT TO CHANGE THE SHAPE OF A DISC CASE? THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE THEM THE SAME SIZE, BUT STILL BLUE.  Also, even more of us, from the younger generations, are converting our \\"entire\\" collections from DVD to Blue-Ray, and then the youngest generation is going straight to Digital \\"Cloud\\" copies of EVERYTHING.<br /><br />* (Most Important...) What type of FAN you are of the series? Are you a SuperFan that needs to watch EVERY Episode AS THEY AIR? ...And Then Buy them IMMEDIATELY as they are released in Blu Ray 7.1 Surround 3-D?<br /><br />* Have you ever even seen a single episode? Are you interested in \\"Catching Up\\" as soon as possible, so that you may watch the FINAL SEASON \\"as it airs\\", Very Soon This Year? (Last 8 episodes... Can't Wait :-D)<br /><br />* Or, are you possibly thinking of using this product as a Gift?<br /><br />* Are you the casual fan that \\"Wants\\" to see as many episodes as possible, in order?<br /><br />* Well, all but Season 6 has aired.  Also, All seasons except for 5&6 are available for FREE STREAMING, and Season 5 is available, for a little cash to stream, or buy, and it's available if you have the DVD option on NetFlix. You could also easily wait for Season 5 to be released in a \\"Free\\" streaming format. (It probably will be soon (probably right about when season 6 begins to air); i apologize for not knowing that! (LOL, that is yet another good reason for owning DVD format copies in the much cheaper version than Blu-Ray...DVD....the ability to loan and borrow them for free  Ha, that could be a \\"perk\\" OR a \\"Liability.\\"<br /><br />* Many times we discover a brand new series available for digital download that have been running hits for seasons and seasons. (If the HORRIBLE SITUATION comes up, and it ALWAYS DOES ACCORDING TO MURPHY) on Long, Popular, \\"Currently Running\\" TV Series', where you find yourself caught BETWEEN the LAST season YOU have seen for FREE Download, The BRAND NEW SEASON is just about to start, and there is an ENTIRE season you haven't seen yet, right in the middle, never fear, there are still ways.  Usually one can PAY a small price per episode (and possibly even less for the entire season), and They are ALWAYS available for Purchase BEFORE they are available for FREE (Whether it's a download or a physical copy bought in a store.)  SOMETIMES, if you have Xfinity, they are available for free just as early, but don't \\"Count\\" on that. Sometimes other websites have digital copies available for download, but watch out.  Some of these sites have, at best, bad picture quality, and at worst, some of them are breaking the law by showing shows they know they have no right to show, but still do.<br /><br />* (This is important:) This is the \\"Positively\\" the BEST format for yourself, or as a gift, for someone who might ALREADY OWN seasons 1-3 IN THE DVD FORMAT, and now they can continue their collection as they prefer.<br /><br />****************NOTE, If you just want to \\"jump on the band wagon\\" and see one of the most amazing shows in decades (even though you are late,  THIS SHOW IS SOOOOOO GOOD, ... That \\"FASTER\\" is Definitely FAR MORE important than your format you choose, then as quickly as possible go to a free video service such as Amazon, or Hulu or NETFLIX, and watch all the seasons they currently have.  Then check ON DEMAND if you are an XFINITY CUSTOMER. If you have a DVD option (additional $) on your Netflix Account, you can get the DVD's through the mail MUCH earlier than you can stream (Download) them. Or you can go to a pay site such as Amazon or iTunes and buy episodes of any season, or any entire season that has been released.<br /><br />***And just because I don't KNOW about all the features that Amazon has to offer, doesn't mean I'm trying to steer the reader away from the Amazon Options.  I'm just ignorant about all they have to offer.  Maybe they have better prices and earlier dates than the other guys. Who Knows?<br /><br />Enjoy
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I like the the whole CD overall. There are obviously some songs that are better then others. The 3rd and 5th songs are the one's I liked the least. Breathe, Time, and Us and Them are the best in my opinion.
B00CATSONE|2.0|I do like mr. Tesla, don't get me wrong, but this \\"book\\" hasn't provided me anything that i wouldn't already read on Wikipedia or similar sites.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I originally played this game on PC through Steam, and while I finished the game and had a lot of fun, I couldn't help but feel just how much better this game is probably on a mobile.<br />It's perfect for when you just need to burn a few minutes although you might just as well end up spending a good hour stuck in the &#34;just-one-more-run&#34; routine.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wish there were more rooms.  Very creative.  Very nice graphics.  Not much for mindless repetitive games so this was perfect.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is very cool app that goes with your Kindle Fire. It's helped us tremendously while we were on vacation.
B009L7MD44|2.0|Difficult to restore default if u mess up. Difficult to transport files from ipad apps. Difficult to bridge with wifi. Not useful at all
B003K16P3M|4.0|I enjoyed the story and the writing.  One scene of intimacy is not for younger readers - the main character is anti-marriage which is a big debate in our society where non committed intimate relationships are common.  but common does not mean correct.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love this show! So glad amazon has it! Can wait to finish season one and then to season two before it starts up again in June
B003XYE7R2|5.0|It's slow going at first, but once the action starts it doesn't stop. I'd recommend this book to all who liked the adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Hey I need internet but my parents are over protective now do I get past parental controls please post answer on a review for this app quick thanks
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Well, I'm a dog lover that just so happens to be a proud owner of a bull-terrier, which is the breed of Sparky the Frankenweenie.  Burton really captures the companionship and love of a boy and his dog.  So much, that the boy will even bring his dog back from the dead, which is the main story here.  I won't spill much, but Tim Burton does it again for the family. This will stab you in the gut and make you cry and then your wounds are healed with laughter.  Sparky really is a charmer and will open your child's heart to understand life and death of love ones.<br /><br />Don't miss out.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|It was okay, but not nearly as good as many other renditions of it.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those types who always gets mad when everything is not in the movie that was in the book, but this was just not impressive in any way.  Rochester and Jane Eyre were well acted, but the pacing of the movie was not good, everything was rushed, and SO MUCH was left out that you couldn't care for the characters at all. There were no good shots in the film and the cinematography was uninspiring. It just could have been way better in many ways.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book series has become a favorite. It beautifully blends the bachelor in a post apocalyptic world. It has the perfect blend of adventure, suspense and romance. Clean. Teen appropriate.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Just another game although it does pass the time. I'll keep playing but probably not very often. Good for a while
B0091REZMW|1.0|it is impossible to view on kindle fire. very frustrating.  maybe a good Pc game. I don't recommend it on aneroid.
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|If you like music, dancing, great story line, give this series a try.  This is what TV should be but isn't most of the time.
B001J1PT82|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in a long time; I first saw it on the typical Late Late Show when I was a teen. I had read Dracula and was fascinated by it and caught most of the classic horror movies starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee... so yeah, this movie always has been one of my favs
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The game is gorgeously designed and fun to play, with enough atmosphere to make it intriguing.  I wish it had been longer.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I tried reading it could not get to far into it<br />Yet I know other people liked it a lot
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Chimamanda Adichie has done it again. As an American African as she said in her book, I felt that I lived the lives of many of the characters in her book. The protagonist Ifemelu was a strong female character who was very passionate and strong. You could not help but hope for everlasting happiness for both her and Obinze. It is a story about growing pains, misplaced youth, lost love and at the end new found love. Great book!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it, use it every day, watch tV and use it, keeps me from snacking! And I can do Solitaire anywhere I want to.
B008602KQI|5.0|As a teacher, I always find books to be much better than the movie; however, this movie is an excellent adaptation of the novel!!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|As much as I liked this film, being that I am Autochthonous, it baffles me how Hollywood after all these years still seems to overlook us for these roles.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Brandon Sanderson has accomplished what I personally believe Robert Jordan was no longer capable of, even if he were still alive: brought Wheel of Time to an acceptable conclusion.<br />As many fans will say, the later volumes of Wheel of Time grew increasingly verbose while at the same time advancing the main storyline very little due to a combination of describing every event in painstaking, mind-numbing detail, and an absolute explosion of subplots.  I once read a transcript of an article Jordan gave before he passed away in which he said he thought he had enough material for a dozen or more books (there were ten at the time) in the main storyline!  (And at the rate he was publishing at the time, he would have needed to live to be around 150 to actually accomplish this).  Since it was only a transcript, I couldn't get a feel for how serious he was at the time, but the last few books he wrote certainly felt like he was trying to stretch things out indefinitely.  This was the main reason I wasn't terribly upset at the thought that the series would forever be incomplete.<br />Sanderson, however, given the clear goal of not just continuing Jordan's work but finishing it (and quickly, comparatively speaking), has, IMHO, done an admirable job.  There are a number of subplots that don't see much - if any - attention, but as I said, there were also an incredible number of them, and Sanderson closed out the ones for the main characters in addition to the main storyline.  A Memory of Light suffers from some of the same verbosity as the other late books in the series, but I think much of that is that so much had to be crammed in, given that there will be no more chances to do so, so i find myself more forgiving than usual in that regard.<br />For long-time readers of Wheel of Time, this is the long awaited conclusion and worth the read, whatever you think about how the series ended up.<br />For Sanderson fans, however, I would recommend steering clear of this for two reasons if you're looking to read something new by him.  First, this isn't really his world, if you will; he was working off of prepared notes left behind by Robert Jordan, and he does a very good job of staying true to the existing canon.  Second, most of the book simply won't make a great deal of sense unless you've read the rest of the series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is pretty good.  It's troubling to start out with.  But once you get to moon,  that's where you get the money.  I like this game pretty well and will give it a rating of * * * * *
B005S9ELY4|1.0|Are you looking for every bad action-drama cliche ever used since the early 50s? Well my friend, look no further! Here is what this film has to offer:<br /><br />1. Headstrong cop that refuses to play by the rules.<br />2. Histrionic mob boss who kills anyone who gives him bad news.<br />3. Five good guys charge fifty bad guys armed with gatling guns and, of course, win.<br />4. Dramatic good guy death scenes, complete with super-cheesy last words.<br />5. Really stupid good guys walk into a trap! Oh no!<br />6. Cop wife drama! Watch the pregnant wife of the dumb cop (see #1) wear your grandmother's tablecloth for a dress and get super upset at her husband for being such a reckless moron.<br /><br />There are many more... the good cop who questions the harsh methods of the other good cops, the corrupt cops and judges who think that being evil is the bee's knees, etc. Pointing them all out could actually become a really fun drinking game.<br /><br />Despite all the above, I think the moral of the story is that Nick Nolte will take whatever role he can because, let's be honest, he probably needs the scratch.<br /><br />Overall, this is really funny film. I imagine Trey Parker and Matt Stone would enjoy it, but it isn't anything they haven't already made fun of.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I've read in recent memory. Keeps you guessing the whole time, with thrilling twists and turns until the very end.
B002JXICCY|4.0|I love (adore!) LZ!<br /><br />But back in 60's they thought you had to add corny stupid stuff (aka gangsters, etc) to sell it.<br /><br />The part that just highlights them is great footage!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I don't know that I have ever read a book that is told strictly from the man's POV. Not only is he doing the story telling, but this book is written in a way that Drew is telling the story to YOU! It was funny, sarcastic, vulgar at times, and just great!<br /><br />Drew is such a man-whore, and makes no apologies for the way he lives his life. Then, he meets his match in Kate, and the sparks fly. This book has plenty of steamy scenes and tension. And of course, when things go bad, (because he is a man-whore) getting to experience what HE goes through to try to win her back is revealing. The couple's interaction is well written and there was never a point where the story felt rushed. There wasn't any huge tear your heart out moments and no cliffhanger, which seems so popular these days. Really enjoyed this book, and I highly recommend it!
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Loved the movie, interesting, insiteful performance with great costume and sets.<br />Hopkins is amazing! Loved learning the the timeline and politics Hitch had in his amazing movie making career.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I was all set to dislike this book based on negative press. I've been a busy single mom and professional and its so hard. Now Sheryl Sandberg says I'm not working hard enough? So glad I read the book because that's not the message at all.  Inspirational, witty, empowering, this is a book that will provide women with a step by step guide for becoming more brave in the workplace.
B003Q6D282|5.0|I love this movie and it is a kewl movie for anyone who loves scary movies or horror  films like me.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Ok, this is a great app and the cloud drive is terrific. The music store is very broad and deep with selections. BUT: the music player will not show up ad an independent icon, you have to go through the Amazon Appstore app. I am amazed by Amazon's lack of common sense and intuitivity! COME ON GUYS!
B004HD61KE|5.0|Let me first say that it takes one heck of a story to keep my attention for 600+ pages.  The Devil Colony is one of a select few that has.  The action is breakneck paced as is the entire novel.  It mixes American History, Native American history, technology, and military action all together into one volume of superb storytelling.  It is a globetrotting adventure like none other.  Its not that you CAN'T put it down - you won't WANT to put it down!
B000001EXR|1.0|Love KISS.<br /><br />Hate grunge. Hate Cobain.<br />Hate that whole &#34;woe is me, I hate life&#34; era of so called music. How mundane? How...sad?<br />Growing up when that music was popular, made me realize now how much it truly sucked since it didnt age well at all.<br />KISS on the other hand was against it (remember the gene quote about grunge?) but then in 1997-1998 they released this crap. I guess money does do all the talking huh? DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS. IT'S FAKE. IT'S NOT REAL. IT'S NOT KISS. It's kiss meets soundgarden....and that's just not cool. If you do get it...and you dont take my advice.....the best thing it can offer you is being a great beer coaster! Catch my drift?
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I loved the free version so much I purchased the paid version. I have to shut the ringer on my phone off when I sleep, and Alarm Clock Extreme works anyway! There are also different ringers to choose from so if you are a heavy sleeper you can set it to LOUD or if you wake up easily you can set it to start out softly and gradually increase in sound. Another great feature is if you get up at the same time every day you can set it for that. I just love this app, very useful and easy to use. Thanks Angle Labs!
B009B8YZIK|3.0|I have not seen this movie, I got it for my grandson, he said it was great, anything concerning halo is great with  him.

B009HUB40Y|1.0|I don't like it and I deleted it from my Kindle Fire.  I did not find it entertaining at all.
B001WCN23W|4.0|To start off...I love BITCH. That song alone is worth the money! But seriously...one of the<br />best, if not the best stones album. From the opening song &#34;Brown Sugar&#34; the album just flows beautifully.<br />I'm not gonna waste a lot of time reviewing this, cause if you're a true stones you know what you like.....<br />Did I mention how much I love BITCH? Do you? Buy the album!
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|Good addition to the series. If you like Excitebike this is your game! I use the on screen controls on my GS3. Lots of fun.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Funny and charming, poignant little story. I enjoyed it, loved Jamie & didn't want the story to end. I was hooked from the first page.

B000PY52EU|5.0|This movie is off the chain!  My man Sammy J did it again! any thing this brother is in is going to be intense and in your face. The rest of the cast set it off right. The bar scene alone puts you in the mood for a funky party, Juke Joint Style.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is the simplest fraction calculator I have ever used and it gives you decimal equivalents as you go. Large main keyboard with separate keypads for the numerator and denominator.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The condition of the movie came out great.  It was unopened and not tampered with.  I will be able to tell you how the actual condition of the viewing of the movie was when I actually watch it.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I remember reading London's &#34;The Call of the Wild&#34; in elementary school, solely upon the recommendation of my teacher. I can't recall my reaction to the book then, but my current position is that this is NOT a kid's book, no matter what my teacher thought! London's human characters are not the rugged role models that a young boy can look up to; they are cruel, ruthless men with little concern for other men, nature, or even the dogs that pull their sleds. His graphic descriptions of the battles between dogs, between dogs and men, between dogs and wolves, are as vivid as any motion picture depiction. Yet, as an adult, there is a certain &#34;rightness&#34; about the entire story. You get caught up in Buck's experiences in Alaska, sometimes forgetting that he is a dog. Despite all the wrong that is done to him, Buck is more than a survivor; he overcomes all odds, lives through dangers that would topple many a man, and ultimately answers the call that has beckoned him for ages - his &#34;Call of the Wild!&#34;
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I absolutely love this series! I stayed up until 3am (on 3 work nights) watching the entire 1st and 2nd seasons.

B008VBYN80|1.0|Game is very addictive,so much so that when it crashed on me i started all over 5 times. The game is full of bugs. Almost nothing works and game stops, freezez or you losecall $ and all xp at any timd. Dont waste your time ir $$
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|THought it was kinda fakish looking and not the best acting and effects but some how I loved it and thought it was a great movie. Well done I liked it a lot 5 stars for me I should have rented it but I guess Ill watch it in the future but good movie all in all.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It was alright but a little slow<br />I don't know if it's because I'm on a kindle fire or what but it seemed slow when I would click on something.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|The book was a slow read with uninteresting characters.  I never say this, but I found the movie was more entertaining and captivating.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|I love this movie and it is a kewl movie for anyone who loves scary movies or horror  films like me.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|First of all - yes, the acting was great. The story however was ridiculous, the characters not believable and Brad Coopers character so thoroughly dislike able in the beginning that I couldn't switch gears in the end. Jennifer Lawrence's character would have been much better off with a better man, she didn't need this loser, his screwed up family and their issues. The storyline was 100% predictable. I hated it. Watched it all but should have turned it off after 15 minutes.
B008X9Z4I8|2.0|I wanted a case that the Kindle Fire HD would fit into with a protection case on it and that is not the case with this.  You could only fit the kindle fire in it.  I wanted a case protection and a carrying case.  I should have read the dimensions better, so it was  my fault I am sure.  If you are only looking for something to slip the kindle into without a case on the kindle this would be great.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|only downfall is greed. would be great time-consumint game for all levels of app players but unfortunately is lured in by the color of money
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It took a while to be published, but &#34;A Memory of Light&#34; was what I hoped for.<br />It brought back the pace and excitement of the first four-five books in the series,<br />and I was sorry to see it end.
B004LX0D36|4.0|It was a great read.  I liked the total reality that was embraced throughout this book.  It makes the characters seem very real.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is nothing of what you would expect. It is absolutely terrifying. If you like to be scared and like to solve mysteries, look no further. Buy this game NOW!!!!!!
B00A7Q814Y|3.0|Haven't got it yet - I'm sure it's great.<br />Just got ripped off that's all.<br />I guess be very careful.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita write down as detail as she can about her NDE<br />and give us a lot of suggestions which we can easily do<br />I love it!
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I was afraid that the sequel would not live up to the charm and freshness of the original, my fears were unfounded. Using elements from the original the author produced a whole new story that was as fresh, enchanting and endearing as the original book. I read this book with my granddaughter who is 12 and the story captured her and opened new avenues of communication between us.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Wow.  This was much better than expected!  Not only are the action scenes novel and thrilling, but most of them are realistic enough to enjoy.  In fact, Arnold's one major fight incorporates an homage to MMA, wrestling, and real life brawls.  Plus it has a nice twist.<br /><br />Most of the movie had twists that I found delightfully unexpected.  Yes, the plot is basic, but not hackneyed.  I found the movie refreshingly different, funny, and well-acted!  Arnold is stiff, but better than he's been in years.  No cheesy Expendables 2 lines.  Some meaning woven into the dialogue.<br /><br />Yeah, the minor characters could have been developed better.  But Knoxville is at his best, adding quite a bit of comedy relief that never takes away from the plot.  Maybe the worst part is one of the bad guys' accent.  He cannot decide if he is French or Southern.  LOL  Other than that, every actor is on point, delivering both comedic and dramatic lines really well.  I was actually surprised at Arnold's tender moments.  It was like watching a beloved statue come to life.  He's pretty stoic, but it worked.<br /><br />Trust me, this is no copycat Hollywood cheese-fest action flick.  Even though I am usually jaded, I cared about the characters and enjoyed the action--from car chases, to shootouts, to ambushes, to hand to hand.  This was a well-shot, novel, funny, and bloody ball!  Worth buying if you love movies like the last Rambo, Fast and Furious, or Gangster Squad.  Good stuff.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  I enjoyed how the author integrated old demi God's into modern times.  Can't wait to read his others.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|This cd arrived in a short amount of time and I like that it came with the MP3 downloads for each song. Glad I bought it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has an interesting premise, well fleshed out characters and is very well written.  Loved it and will continue to follow the series.,
B00BJNHACS|5.0|I got this game on my Kindle for my 2 boys (ages 7 and 9).  They love it but prefer to play it on their dad's smartphone.  Go figure...
B008OW1SAC|5.0|Wont' get into an in-depth review of this album, as you should just listen to it, but I will say that this is one of the most coherent, beautiful albums I have heard in a long time.  The harmonies and rhythms are complex but unpretentious; Joe Newman's voice is sublime and unusual.  There is absolutely no fluff here.<br /><br />Bottom line: listen to this album.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|This movie turned out to be an excellent blend of brutal action, stylish period drama with sharp dialogue, and a little history.  The movie gives you just enough history to understand why Cohen was a big threat to California and why this tiny underdog team is basically on a suicide mission.  The protagonists are real men doing what needs to be done for no thanks, no credit, no money, no support, and no guarantee of success.  These are plain, rough, good guys facing off against a literal army of deeply scummy bad guys.<br /><br />The actors are all superb.  Not one of the characters is played by a poor performer.  Even the goons on Cohen's payroll, the cops, and the minor players are faces you've seen before.  Penn is an enthralling evil and accurate gangster.  Not over-the-top, as some have complained.  He is frightening, unpredictable, and thoroughly evil.  A genuine threat at all times.  No dumby.  He's a cleverly evil guy with a big ego.  The Gangster Squad is a group of heroes, each very different from the other.  It is clear who is who and what is driving each guy.  The movie does not have one flawed actor.  Incredible performances keep you tied to the story.<br /><br />The plot is full of realistic twists, character flaws, mistakes made by good guys and bad guys alike, thrilling action scenes, hit and run missions, and a final confrontation that is worth watching a few times.<br /><br />Frankly, I wish we had a few Gangster Squads in America today.  This movie was a clear good versus evil flick based on reality.  The characters are all gray, yet lovable.  What an unexpectedly fun movie!  Worth a buy.
B0097EWK3A|2.0|This game was your typical object find game, purchased thru the &quot;free coins&quot; from Amazon and downloaded to my Kindle. Interesting enough to keep my attention, the objects were okay as far as difficulty to find, gameplay &quot;eh&quot; at times (lots of repetition just to find one piece, but many games have that). Then....Just before the end, the stupid thing FREEZES!!! I had to finally uninstall it, but that deleted my progress!! If I had paid instead of used the coins, I would have been even angrier!! Uninstalled!!
B00BBW16HW|4.0|This movie was not what I expected.  It really shows what one person can do to help another and the person doing the helping is more blessed by the interaction than he or she ever dreamed.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|No need to be original reviewing this app, I liked it so much that I wanted to make sure it got my rating.  It's possibly one of the best apps I have seen introduced.  Very easy to use.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I purchased this game through Kindle because I loved it (and the 2 sequals) on PC.  So far, the game play is the same and there are no in game things to purchase (also yay!).  I admit to savoring the game and playing it slowly, so if there are glitches, I haven't run across one yet.  Happy me!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I had no hope for this movie, but I was wrong.  Tom can pull off the role of a much larger man (read the books) who is tough as nails.  The plot is filled with enough mystery, intelligence, and twists to keep you wondering what will happen next.  Three important characters' loyalties are constantly in question.  Jack is always in charge and driving the plot.  He is a no nonsense, get to it kind of guy.  This makes you keep your eye on every scene.  The only weak part is the gun shop owner.  But Duvall is the actor, so the guy is enthralling!<br /><br />If you want to see a smart, violent, action flick, this is the one for you.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|This app used to be amazing, since they upgraded it my predictive text only gives punctuation and the flow doesn't work at all on my htc.  Also their support is basically nil.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|FYI Seaons One is just the first taste of the awesome vampire fantasy series. If you enjoy vamp stories don't miss this one. If you don't have it....get it!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Original, non-violent, humorous, and portrays edgy and egotistical lawyers who you love to watch outwit their opponents in the legal world.
1400049628|5.0|I believe this guide so far was the one closest to the probable. Well if there are zombie or undead I do not know. More ... I will use this guide to survive.
B003VW8GT6|5.0|This is one of my favorites of John Wayne although I could probably say that about almost all of his movies.  I purchased this version  because I did not find it any less expensive anywhere else.  I try to find the best value on his dvds because I am trying to get his entire collection of movies.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as much as the Matt Damon versions. I hope they make more as this movie is really just a movie that fills you in on the new characters but ties into the others very well!
B008NAFU9A|5.0|Not my first book from this author and it won't be my last. She has a great talent for capturing her readers to understand the paranormal world her characters live in and how it relates to ours. Her Sweetest Downfall, like most of her books, tells the story of a young lady caught between two worlds...the one she portrays and the one she's been handed by fate. Filled with love, loyalty (or lack there of), and world of fantasy elements, Ophelia gives reader something to follow as she makes moves in hopes to protect her family, save her lover (from herself), and stay sane doing it.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|After his last two films I consider Paul Thomas Anderson easily to be the best filmmaker of my lifetime.  Aficionados should note that his name is comprised of three Biblical Apostles.  And I have come to consider his films to be highly theological, although of course in a necessarily cryptic manner, since Anderson lives and works in 2013 America.  I did not fully see this myself after several viewings of There Will Be Blood, Mr. Anderson's previous masterpiece (and I mean that very sincerely), even though it was pointed out to me that Daniel Plainview is very much a \\"god\\"-type of character, in the strictly Old Testament sense of the word.  I turned this over in my mind but was not convinced.  Now I surely am.<br /><br />The main character in his latest movie, Freddie Quell, is The Master of this story.  He is falsely accused of of poisoning a fellow field worker, an old man who Freddie says \\"looks like [Freddie's] father.\\"  Freddie defends himself somewhat feebly, stating that the old man \\"took the drink himself. He took the drink.\\"<br /><br />The implication is that the old man felt worthy to take the cup and drink of it.  The same argument can surely be made in defense of the \\"villainous\\" Daniel Plainview,  Mr. Anderson's \\"Old Testament Lord\\" figure from There Will Be Blood.  But Freddie states his case quick and hot-foots it out there.  He is looking for spiritual fuel, not fossil fuel.<br /><br />When Freddie finally meets Lancaster Dodd, the guru-type man whom he sincerely desires to be his spiritual \\"master,\\" the first thing Dodd asks Freddie to do is to provide a wedding party with one of his special \\"alcoholic\\" concoctions.  That would be stuff Freddie makes from both fermented fruit juice...and various industrial products including some sort of film-developing solution,  various new versions of which have Freddie cripplingly addicted.<br /><br />Those who are both aware of Anderson's level of filmmaking and Scripturally literate will already be convinced.<br /><br />I read one critical review stating that this movie had accomplished something difficult, in that it is a good movie with \\"no likable characters.\\"  I disagree.  Although he is inarticulate, scarred and flaky, Freddie never actually commits any serious sinful act in the entire movie.  The closest he comes to it is slapping around a few grown, able-bodied men who don't seem to mind too terribly much.  Keep in mind that this is set in the immediate aftermath of World War II, and Freddie himself is a veteran.  And Freddie also slaps himself, and takes his own beatings from others, without much aplomb or dignity but also without much ado.<br /><br />Dignity seems truly impossible to Freddie, and thus humility comes easily to him, because he either cannot or will not settle down with a decent wife.  He actually ignores the obvious flirtations and solicitations of several attractive young women, a couple of whom are married.  The first girl who he gently rejects in the film's chronology, and who he comes later to remember as the woman who was meant for him, he stopped seeing because she was too young.  She was a sophomore in high school.<br /><br />I would go even a step further and maintain that none of the male characters in the movie, nor most of the female ones, seem especially wicked in any way. Lancaster Dodd can be seen as a religious charlatan, but from the perspective of 2013 his type of therapeutic \\"quackery\\" can only be viewed as quaint.  He also clearly has sincere feelings about \\"his\\" ideas (at one point it is ambiguously suggested that his wife actually dictates his material to him), and that he does not consider \\"his work\\" to be sheer crackpottery.  He is as egotistical as most of the men who inhabit the film's world, but he also really thinks he is helping people.  And his patients/followers/acolytes also say that he is helping them.  They drink his cup most eagerly.  His wife, along with his daughter, are depicted as the most cynical and conniving characters in the movie.  Most of the male characters beside Freddie are depicted as harmless meandering milquetoasts, who are led around like sheep either by their back pocket (wallet) or their front one (zipper).  The \\"master,\\" Dodd seems hopelessly apron-strung against Freddie's approach to life and love.<br /><br />I didn't think I could like a movie more than I have enjoyed There Will Be Blood.  But I must say I am undecided now.  The Master is a masterpiece.
B002OT731E|5.0|THIS IS FOR BIG SPEAKERS AND ROOM TO REALLY LISTEN. TURN THE PHONE OFF AND THE TV BOX ALSO. KICK BACK. IF YOU ONLY LISTEN TO A COLLECTION ONCE AND MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT YOU HEARD, THIS COLLECTION IS NOT FOR YOU.<br />LISTEN TILL IT SINKS DEEP INTO YOUR SOUL IF ONE'S AVAILABLE TO YOU. BORROW ONE IF YOU HAVE TOO. GREAT LAID BACK ROLLING STONES, CLASSIC RECORDING. DON'T EXPECT A BIG CROWD SCREAMING ITS NOT THERE. THIS A MIDDLE OF THE STONES CAREER SOUND. BRIAN JONES AND MICK TAYLOR HAVE COME AND DIED, SO TO SPEAK. TO ALL STONES FANS/LOVERS GET IT AND NOW.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|This movie was just that right in the middle.  There were some decent action parts and I was not expecting it to be a real &#34;Arnold movie&#34; so that helped me go into it with an open mind.  Some of the action shots with him in it were just kind of sad and makes you want to watch some of his older movies.  It was not awful though and would not discourage the rental of it.  Maybe he needed this one to get back into the swing of things here is to high hopes for his next one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down! For one second totally exhilarating! A really God buy ,it draws you in at very word
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I enjoyed the story of this young lady on a path to self discovery, finding love, and dealing with an alternative world unknown to most, but what I really enjoyed was the writing the author put forth(I think it's the English major in me). The flow of the story is remarkable and the dialogue has a realistic feel I'm certain readers will appreciate it. 5 out of 5 stars for in depth details and proper transitional flow.
B008645YH6|5.0|Perfect. It met more than my expectations!!! I love Marina and the Diamonds and the CD is so much more than great!!!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|How do you review a clock? The numbers are sharp but it serves its purpose. Its a clock and it tells time!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I really loved this movie.  I read a lot of bad reviews on it and was hesitant going in however I could not be happier.  Everyone complained about the actors singing however, to me, the way it was done brought a lot of passion and emotion to each of their roles.  I have already watched this multiple times and really do not think I could get sick of it.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I actually already own this game, bought it from the Google Play store, and this is well worth actually spending the money on it. It's fiendishly addictive and fun. The only problem is that it's quite short, I beat it in less than a day, and there's a certain point where the resources collected become useless and just pile up. That's the only reason I can't give it 5 stars... right out of the box.<br /><br />On the plus side, the dev's blog has stated that there will eventually be a content update that'll add to the post-game, which is very exciting. It might bump this to 5 stars if that update is any good.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Enticing enough to want to read more in the series when I don't have another more exciting book to read. Scientific descriptions are too long.
B007N85POS|5.0|This game is very addictive. We can not stop playing it. My daughter is a lot better at this game than me.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I enjoyed book two and am looking forward to book three. I like Larsson's books and feel they he did a great job at keeping up the suspense.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|It was a very good movie.We love movie night at home now we can even rent movies on computer.What will they think of next.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This game is very fun and chill, but the Odyssey mode is short and the Arcade modes can get quite frustrating in the higher levels. Also, the early Arcade modes are basically just the Odyssey stages over again, to the point where when you unlock them the first time the first stages of each are already starred as completed, which just seems like a weird decision.<br /><br />The music, while interesting the first few listens, can get a bit old and samey after a while, and the pitch ups and downs with the speed manipulation mechanics can get a bit grating, so it might be good to have your own trance or other relaxing, ethereal music on hand to use as accompaniment.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is the best $0 kindle read I've had.  You really perceive the doggedness of Tesla in this book.<br /><br />There's a nice build-up that analyzes the necessary qualities of genius.  The author's conception of genius echoes Malcolm Gladwell's.  But then the author doesn't really put Tesla under the Gladwell microscope.  There's no discussion of the subtle advantages of Tesla's circumstances.  The real message here is that Tesla was a hard worker, which is confirmed elsewhere, and this dedication to craft is how he made inventions that changed the world.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book thoroughly.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This has to be one of the best games I have ever played.  A true Iron Man game if there ever was one.  Excellent controls, and a great story. And the fact that it was free makes it even better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great Book!!!!!!! Couldnt put it down cant wait to read the third book, I am sure it will be great!
B00005YU1O|5.0|This video is a most enjoyable way of absorbing modern philosophy as well as pop culture in a stimulating dream.
0545123275|5.0|Sam and Grace have known each other for years, in a sense. Grace has only known him as her wolf. She looks for him every winter. Sam, on the other hand, has been in love with Grace since he was a child. Now, she's practically the only thing that tethers him to the human world. Stiefvater has created an interesting world here, where werewolves shift based on the temperature and their age. The nature of their shape-shifting feels more like science-fiction than fantasy. The plot is simple, Sam worries if he shifts, that he won't be able to shift back. There's a subplot involving the town threatening to kill off the wolves, and that keeps the book energized. I think there's an even balance between plot and romantic development. It has a very melancholy feel. Actually, it feels blue, which is strange since both the cover and the type are blue. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Twilight, only because I think it does was Twilight tried to do much better. It's a better relationship and much better writing.<br /><br />It will appeal to anyone who enjoys YA paranormal romance.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is such a fun movie for everyone!  The graphics are incredible and the movie is inspiring.  I recommend it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Love the game. It's cool  I like characters, and  the theme.<br /><br />This is a cool game. I like the theme and the characters. The weapons and upgrades are also really good. I would suggest this to others, and of all ages.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These headphones came as described.  They're perfect for people who don't like earbuds (like me) and they stay on your head nicely.  Recommended.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My 5 year old is really enjoying this app. She loves being able to buy her own pets, houses, and accessories. She was able to figure everything out and catch on pretty quick with how to play the game and do everything on her own.The only thing that is a downside to this is that some of the pets, houses, and other accessories require actual money being put towards them. My daughter doesn't understand that I am not going to load $20 onto my account just for this game. Otherwise, a pretty great app!
B0000025JT|5.0|This was and will always be one of the great pairings in music. Along with her and Neil Diamond. You don't bring me flowers.
B00A83075M|5.0|When my 7 year old son asked to see this, I hadn't even heard of it.  When he described what he saw in trailers, I was far from convinced.  For one thing, I wasn't sure he had an accurate idea of what the movie was about, I mean, why would a character LIVE in a video game?  Secondly, I'm not often entertained by animation in my old age.<br /><br />This movie took me completely by surprise!  It is visually entertaining with something of interest to see in all shots!  Anyone who had Atari 2600, original NES and even current gamers will love all the references in this movie!  I love the old school bits, the humor that was meant for parents, but not too bold for children to hear.  This just overwhelmed me with the cuteness and fun of it all.  We bought it as soon as it came out on DVD.<br /><br />Do not hesitate with this one.  You will LOVE it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is amazing!!!:) it is also addicting because once you beat a score you try to beat that one. It is the best game!!!:)
B00BN3DPQ4|2.0|The Last Stand did not have the action, tone or pace that I thought it would.  The trailers made it out to be a sort of throwback to action films of the 80s.  What we get is a series of not-very-well-choreographed action sequences, much too much plot, shallowly written supporting characters with subplots that seem to go nowhere, and way too much time spent with the bad guys.  I guess the film was entertaining enough for what it was, but it never once hit the bullseye for me.  Arnold was in decent form, however.  I just wish he had a cooler script to return with.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I really enjoyed the way the story has been rewritten, and the characters introduced, but as usual with Jackson's movies, the chase sequences through the mines are too long and go way over the top! He needs someone to say &#34;  Enough Peter!&#34; and cut about 15 minutes out of the special effects, they're very clever, but too much.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|One if not the best book I have ever read. I am a college student and I am just starting my life. This book has taught me so much about who I am and who I want to be. It is something I will always treasure.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is an amazing game for anyone who enjoys match 3 games. It has a ton of replayability and unlockables. I highly recommend this game!
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|A beautiful unique and amazing love story told in fashion in a high wire act. You really have to see this for yourself!  I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. The make-up , dancing, swim routines, high wire acts and the passion in everyonez faces of a love story being translatted to you. Again, You Really Have To See This For Yourself!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I was talked into watching this by a friend and it was thoroughly enjoyable.<br />A lot of action and of course a lot of mystery.<br />Only drawback was some of the scenes moved so quickly at times it was difficult to keep up.<br />All in all a very good program and I am looking forward to the next installment.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Can't wait for the second season! This show has lots of action and the fight scenes are choreographed very nicely.
B00942G4UA|4.0|It was an honest and very investigative documentary. Very well done. I think it will at least change how I look at the food I eat and where it comes from.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I'm almost 30 and I love this movie. The video game jokes are sprinkled in just enough to make you laugh and feel slightly nostalgic.
B00542UMIY|5.0|Pork Chop (our Chihuahua) loved this movie because for far too long her kind have been unfairly labeled as &#34;ankle biters&#34;, &#34;yippee rats&#34; and called other derogatory names.<br /><br />This movie highlighted the positive aspects of the Chihuahua's noble nature and even shed light into the heroism that is possible when you apply yourself.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This story follows closely the history of that through the use of interesting characters from different backgrounds.  I enjoyed the book but at this kind of pricing I'll wait for the library to get the next one.  The publisher seems a bit greedy to me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once we got started we could not stop. Enjoyed it much. Good carry through from episode to episode.<br />Quite a change from todays way of living.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|First this movie is hard to follow at times, so you may need to watch it more than once to understand the full concept.  I got lost a couple times about what was happening.  The acting is really stellar, and the daily battle with mental illness is brought to the big screen.  Just like any illness it has a toll on the family, and friends.  This is an excellent movie, just one I would not purchase to put in my movie collection.
B00BUT5I84|4.0|Overall, this album is pretty good.  It's more mellow than 'This Is War' in which most songs had an epic quality to them.  The songs on here are more toned down.  My biggest complaint is that of 12 tracks, 4 are fillers.  So out of an 8 song album: 4 are upbeat, 3 are slow, and 1 (Northern Lights) is mid-tempo.  The slower songs are actually pretty good though, and as usual Leto's focus shine through the changes in tone/pitch.  The only song I'm not huge on is 'Bright Lights' which is rather lackluster.  Highlights are 'The Race', 'City of Angels', and 'Do or Die.'  This album would have been much better if even 2 of the filler tracks were exchanged for more upbeat, passionate songs.  With that said, the album is worth the purchase if you are really into Thirty Seconds to Mars, just know this is way different than their last album.  Hopefully their next cd will pick the tempo back up, though we'll probably have to wait til 2017 to find that out.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|The story is original and can be used to teach kids about friendship and loyalty.  There is so much to explore.  My grandsons (ages 4 &amp; 2) have gone through the story repeatedly.  And though it is a bit embarrassing to admit, I was thrilled to find some alone time to listen and play without them around to touch the interactive parts, interrupting the story.  Plus, I found the rest of the stars!!!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I have not seen the movie, nor do I plan to.  This story was predictable pretty much every step of the way.  I felt like this story has been told 100s of times.  Not that impressed, not sure why they made it into a movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I just purchased this yesterday and already I am in love. It's so easy to use and I enjoy being able to listen to my music to wake up to!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This movie is amazing, the plot is well written and has a twist that it took me by surprise.  Yes it is a romance story and the sappy romantic types will love this movie.  Both main actors/actress are great looking, but their on camera compatibility is amazing too!<br /><br />I will be adding this one to my movie collection
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I downloaded this game expecting some weak game that would take 5 maybe 10 minutes.. i was proven wrong 12 hours and i still am going! This game is intense and keeps you on your toes. By far the BEST ANDROID GAME YET! Eighty Eight Games has made a real gem here that i cam guarantee will leave you wanting more!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|My dad was a B-17 Bombardier with the &#34;MIGHTY 8th&#34; in WWII. He read this book and gave it to me. He was almost unable to recount the story to me as so much of it brought his own experiences back to life. He had always told me that he had the highest regard for the Luftwaffe pilots he flew against. This book gives incredible insight into the life of those aviators in this time of such terrible suffering. If you like true biographical accounts of WWII you will love this book. If you are just a lover of great human interest stories, this book is for you. Whatever your reading preference, GET THIS BOOK!!! I guarantee you will not be disappointed
B0018QQQK8|3.0|Kind of predictable, but an enjoyable story.  Nicholas Sparks is my &#34;go to&#34; for a feel good love story.  The few books of his I have read were all good stories.
B00B7TGY0S|5.0|Awesome. Very happy. So simple to place and get my order. I know I will be shopping again and again.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|This book, along with all the books by JKZ I have read changed my life. It both rich and easy to understand. And yet it challenges you to live, should you be inclined to the contrary. The reading my JKZ is a glorious bonus. He sounds like a friend who knows you and is ready to help you. And help he does.<br />As therapeutic this book was for me, I know that it can be of value to anyone. When you are done reading, you will know who you are.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|this game is addictive, but i don't like the panda bear that only allows me to play 5 times until the hearts are replenished
B009R659L8|5.0|I really did enjoy this book, once again Mary Higgins Clark kept my attention, through the whole book.<br />Some reviews said there were too many characters, and it was hard to keep up with, that really made the book<br />so interesting.  Only once did I have to look back in the book, but if I would have kept reading she would bring the character<br />back in and I remembered.<br />Just like all her other books I hated for it to end, can not wait for the next new one to come out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Not often do I find a seqel better than the original .. this is one of those gems! A must have game.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It made my web browsing experience quite easy and simple to get to, I trust that those using it will be as pleased as I am

0385535147|1.0|Lots of descriptive paragraphs that are there for no other reason than to add word count. Unfortunately, this is not Grisham's best, or even close to it. Not all that interesting, the edge-of-your-seat feel isn't there, and it wraps up rather quickly leaving the reader thinking, \\"It just now got interesting!\\"

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the way this series presents history through the lense of a particular family. So many issues are addressed - the very beginniing of the crumbling of the class system in Britain; the interdependence of the servant class and aristocracy; men's and women's roles; gay/straight issues; the prison system; the suffrage movement; the long standing, long smoldering relationship between northern Ireland, southern Ireland, and Britain (and why the heck ARE the British still in Ireland? Having lived in Scotland for four years, that question continues to haunt me). All of these issues are woven into the story of very well drawn/well loved characters that I continue to think about and care about for days after watching an episode. The challenge of a novelist is to create characters the readers care about; Downton Abbey has succeeded in spades.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Up to now, it's known this is the best book in the series.<br /><br />Rich with betrayal, epic scenes, hidden magic, growing dragons and bloodbaths, this is what the worlds of Westeros and Esos are made for!

B00CW665VI|5.0|Okay, 2 words aren't enough; it's deservant of a few more words as it was utterly fabulous and I absolutely devoured it! For a debut, this wipes the floor with many of the established authors out there. Emma Chase has given us a book that has everything in a perfect read; great characters, great story, fabulous humour (my hubby was very unimpressed at having his Star Trek film interrupted by my racket), amazing sex (sorry but blunt is all I can be on that one), romance, arguments, passion, angst and frustration.<br /><br />The difference between this and so many others out there, it is written from the guys perspective. Straight away this is a winner as I love getting into a male characters head. And the protagonist, Drew doesn't disappoint. A 28 year old Investment Banker, he's arrogant, stubborn, selfish, intelligent, VERY sexy and crass, in the most hilarious laugh-out-loud way. And in the words of his sister, 'The Bitch', women lay down for him like sacrificial lambs.  That is until Kate, also Investment Banker, also stubborn, feisty and determined begins working at his Dad's company. She is certainly no lamb.<br /><br />It was so refreshing to read a book where the female lead is as strong, determined and as stubborn as the male. And it worked perfectly because I fell in love with them both.  Their battles, professionally and personally, were argumentative and immature, yet protective, sweet, passionate and realistic (the icing on the cake). I laughed, I made those 'sighs' of appreciation that we women are prone to when we are smitten with a fine literary love-god, I laughed alot more and it has those moments that are simply heartwarming and tug on the heartstrings, but aren't sappy.<br /><br />If this is a taste of things to come from this author then I very much look forward to what she treats us to in the future.  5 stars? Not enough.
B006Z7NTCI|5.0|I had this CD which died along with my entire CD collection when my home was flooded.  Recently, I heard the first track on Pandora and was instantly reminded how accomplished, moving, innovative it is.  Thrilled to have it back in my recovering collection.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|Airbourne's first two releases sounded like AC/DC, but better. On Black Dog Barking, they sound much more like a cross between AC/DC and Def Leppard when each band was in its prime. Straightforward, party-time rock here...no ballads, no \\"message\\". Highly recommended.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was expecting something different when I started watching this movie.  The first 20 minutes took me somewhere that I didn't expect to go.  It eventually settled in to more of what I had envisioned.  Very beautiful visually, particularly the contrast between home, the city, and the arena.  Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, and Wes Bentley were phenomenal.<br /><br />I wish that Closed Captioning would become available for Sony products.  I have a condition that makes it very hard to decipher conversation.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|3.5 out of 5<br /><br />An evil mastermind terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is wreaking havoc via a rash of bombings, holding the world in his grip. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets on the case and discovers the bombings are initiated by people exposed to the Extremis program, something Stark Industries could've had ties to a long time ago, but chose not to. Turns out those Tony Stark knew back then are neck-deep involved with what's going on now, have re-entered his life, and are making things complicated.<br /><br />While trying to pinpoint the location of the Mandarin, Iron Man aka Tony is also dealing with the aftermath of the Chitauri invasion of New York in The Avengers. Having trouble sleeping, he's been spending all his time constructing various Iron Man armors to help himself cope. This brings tension to his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who he's now living with and is dedicated to.<br /><br />Upon discovering the location of the Mandarin and his true identity, Iron Man and his almost-sidekick the Iron Patriot aka War Machine aka Col. James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) head up against a battalion of Extremis-infected warriors and must pull out all the stops to put an end to their reign of terror. The problem is these Extremis soldiers are so powerful that victory doesn't seem likely.<br /><br />Can Iron Man prevail against an army as strong as he is?<br /><br />I'm not sure what to make of this movie. Sure, it was entertaining and the storyline was fine. I like the idea of making it a direct follow up to The Avengers, and showing how Tony Stark's world--never mind the rest of the world--had been affected by the Chitauri invasion and the presence of the other Avengers.<br /><br />This flick was loaded with solid action, tough bad guys, cool tech, guns and everything else that makes an Iron Man movie a lot of fun. I just wasn't sold on the presentation. This might be harsh, but this flick came off as the Batman Forever of the Iron Man movies. I'm all for humor in even the most serious of movies, but it seemed the jokes were either too forced or too slapstick to make me take this flick seriously. And that's the secret with superhero movies: they need to take themselves seriously--even if they're meant to be a comedy--otherwise they'll never work. There was an awful lot of getting in and out of the Iron Man suits in this film, both by Tony and Rhodey, never mind Pepper getting a shot at wearing it, the President, the Extremis guy--there were so many suit changes that the novelty of watching someone don the Iron Man was quickly spent after the first three times.<br /><br />This film was not directed by Jon Favreau, which might have had something to do with it. Just seems this movie was weighed down with not enough Iron Man and a storyline--which was solid in and of itself--that moved slowly. I realize Tony's aftermath and post-traumatic stress from The Avengers was the focus, but the same goal could've been accomplished had there been more Iron Man. I don't necessarily mean more action--as action-filled movies that are nothing but explosions start to finish get boring after a while--but perhaps him having a love/hate relationship with the suit because being in it nearly killed him at the end of The Avengers, or maybe take the robo-injections to summon the suit to a new level because he's trying to make himself super to be on par with guys like Captain America or Thor and have him deal with that?<br /><br />The extra scene at the end of the credits with Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) picked up on the bromance from The Avengers. A nice touch. Didn't move the Marvel cinematic universe forward in any way, but was a nice touch.<br /><br />If you're a Marvel movie completest, then by all means, check it out. Likewise, pick up the Blu-ray when it comes out to complete your set. For me, I think I'm going to have watch it again and perhaps I'll warm up to it a bit more. I felt let down when I watched the first Spider-Man in 2002, but got more into it with subsequent viewings. Iron Man 3 might be one of those movies.<br /><br />Just think they could've done a lot more with it.tched the first Spider-Man in 2002, but got more into it with subsequent viewings.

1452658145|3.0|A lot of interesting facts and scenarios, not that much I would disagree with.<br /><br />But it just seemed to be a survey of information and not so much an application of knowledge.  I want to know how to help my own kids succeed.  But mostly the book centered on fringe cases that don't easily translate into any actions for me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The show has excellent acting and costumes. It has a compelling story line and it is very much worth watching
B005UKJX4E|5.0|This is an astonishing and ambitious film.  I've seen it three times and wept each time.  A most profound, sustained meditation on The Book of Job in the Bible.  Viewers who don't understand this dimension of the film will miss much of the point.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I'm going to keep this short, because talking about Persona can lead down many winding roads.  If you've played the original, I believe this game will still offer sufficient content to warrant a new playthrough.  With entirely new content like a couple of extra S. Links and a whole new dungeon, in addition to tweaking gameplay (like allowing players to choose what abilities inherit during fusion), Atlus has breathed new life into P4.<br /><br />Now, ignore that that last paragraph if it completely confused you.  If you've never played or heard of Persona 4, but you're interested in playing, I would recommend this version.  If you are at all interested in JRPGs, character development, or story on any level I think you're in for a great time.  And don't worry if you have no idea what you're doing- features like Vox Populi, which can help steer you in a good direction by seeing how other players allocate their time, and Rescue Messages, which allow you to request help from other players for combat, can help even the most clueless player feel confident in what they're doing<br /><br />If you have a Vita, you should get this game. If you don't, wait for the price on Vitas to crash and then buy this game
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Great read, very entertaining and captivating. Reminded me of his earlier novels like Patriot Games and Sum of All Fears.
B0012NO316|5.0|This piece is a great, darkly comic presentation of the American stigmas we insert into marriage and family, what they do to ourselves and people around us, and our definitions of success.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I'd heard her TED talk, so I knew what her basic thesis is going in to this book.  She documents everything well, and the writing style is readable and accessible.  At times, it goes a bit more slowly than I would like and there are places where she seems repetitious.  But overall, I really like this book and found it very informational and affirming, since I myself am in introvert and could relate to so much of what she describes.  I recommend it for introverts who want to understand more about why we struggle sometimes in meetings and in general culture, and also for parents who have introverted kids.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|WOW!!!!! The scene with the train......still haven't caught my breath! That's' all I am saying! Enjoy the retro look, reminded me of my childhood in the 70's!
B000XKZQ74|5.0|Superb acting and directing lead to a taut drama of an investigation into the private life of a couple during the Communist control of East Germany.  A behind the curtain look at the workings of the abhorent Stasi secret police and their policies towards their own citizens before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  This film deserved the titile of Best Foreign Film 2007

B008CPZNL6|5.0|I've been a Flipboard fan for a while now, mostly using it on my phone.  The Kindle Fire version lays out a bit differently on the screen, which takes a bit of getting used to, but it's bright, clear, easy to read, and photos look great.  The main thing I like about Flipboard is how much better photos and photo links look on it than on the native Twitter or Facebook apps.  This Kindle version does not disappoint.
B00C7KXUOE|3.0|I like this show, so I really wanted to see the episode pulled by NBC, but it didn't add anything new to the episodes aired.  Purchase if like me you need to see every single episode!

1451695195|1.0|This book about a man's dream totally lacks rational thinking much less any \\"proof\\" of anything.  If this was written for a first year philosophy class it would get an F.  It is a shame for me since I was hoping for something with intellectual value.  A good book with some actual substance is Richard Dawkins' \\"The God Delusion\\".  This guy should stick to medicine.  I bet he is a good doctor but knows nothing about making a valid argument.

B00B9YDT5Y|5.0|Rather than crab about \\"yet another\\" greatest hits compilation from this band, I'll stick to what makes it the best one. Firstly, the sound quality on these remastered recordings is fantastic and surpasses any other previous collection. Also, it is quite extensive. For a casual fan that's never purchased anything by the band, this is likely all you'll ever need, as it neatly focuses on all of the band's output, including both early and new recordings. Also included are two brand new recordings just to round it out and maybe suggest the band's not finished yet.  All in all, the best collection out there for Simple Minds. Nice packaging, decent price, and a great track selection spanning the band's 30 years in the business.

193700788X|1.0|I rushed out to buy this book the day it was released.  I should have saved my time and money.  The book seemed to be thrown together.  The writing style also was poor compared to the other books. The Eric storyline showed a complete lack of imagination and total disregard for how the character has been portrayed in the past.  At the end of the book, all I could think about Sookie was how shallow she was as written in this book.  All around disappointing.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Not a lot of Sookie/Eric interaction. You may want to read to see Sookie's outcome, but it is my least favorite Stackhouse novel.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is a great modern Bond movie. The DVD Blu - ray quality is great. Haven't figured out the digital copy yet, but watched the movie 3 times !! love it.
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|I should also add that, the fact that this title requires no permissions is awesome is the reason for the second star. Besides that this is a very basic simple puzzle RPG there are much better ones out there,for instance dragon pad is much better and looks better. There seems to be a growing trend out there for the retro graphics. Which that is this games high part. The rest the game is very confusing terrible sliding action on the tiles. All these things can be ignore it if you are a very novice player, however I require a little bit more of a challenge, and a game that actually has a mission. This game all you do is run and until. if you run out of time the game ends. The end nothing fancy, but if you're looking for game that has no permissions and has good retro Factor then this would be a good title.

B0047WJ11G|5.0|One of the better time travel/exploration of how the mind works type of movies is quite a while. It really keeps your mind filing on all cylinders to try and follow just what is real and what isn't.  One of those good movies that makes you question your own reality!  I highly recommend it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a good time passer. It doesn't get boring. Any one can play it because it is easy. It is something rlthat every one should have downloaded on all of their devices.

B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|Cloud Atlas destroys Brazil in a \\"most pointless movie ever\\" contest. At least Brazil attempted humor and plot, whereas Cloud Atlas is a very long disconnected parade pseudo-intellectual posing. Since it has no character development or plot, it's difficult to call it a story. It's really just a series images which give a vague impression of a cynical profundity without substance.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Seemed like the goal was to combine a Janet Evanovich Stephanie Plum type adventure with enough graphic sex to get some buzz going.  The trilogy was good enough to break into the limelight for a late starting writer.  I feel like the author is so much better than this but might not find the readers if she wrote something that showed off her talent.  The most explicit sexual encounters read more like they were written by a man, maybe in the 1970s.

B00C061I3K|5.0|when i listened to this album, it really suprised me what they did with it. most of the songs are catchy (Give Life Back to music,Get Lucky, Instant Crush,Game of Love, Giorgio by the Moroder,Lose yourself to dance,Contact,doin it right,beyond) while some are interesting enough to like (Touch,within,motherboard,fragments of life). this album is near perfect. this is definitely more different then their other albums. this could either be their best,or worst.
B00B04NJLW|2.0|It seems like a simple enough concept--get 26 directors and feature each in a short film strung together by the loose idea that we're presenting an alphabet of death.  Many of these directors are up-and-comers on the indie scene who've made strong movies.  Some have even worked in much better anthology films (I'm thinking of V/H/S), so they've proven themselves with the short style.  But it all goes so horribly, horribly wrong.<br /><br />There are, maybe, twenty minutes of good, horror movie viewing here.  There's about an additional ten-minutes of gore-hound heaven if you just want to watch torture porn.  But much of this is just truly horrible.  I admire the filmmakers for taking an international approach, and some of the foreign shorts (especially XXL) are particularly disturbing, but the Japanese contributions to the film seem like deliberate parodies of Japanese culture and television--like something South Park would do rather than legitimate movie makers.<br /><br />*HERE THERE BE SPOILERS*<br /><br />For instance, a lesbian Japanese school girl who wants to die smelling her teacher's farts and then gets sucked up inside the teacher's bum.  That, believe it or not, is one of the less ridiculous shorts from Japan.  The final installment, for Z, is so incredibly ridiculous that it seems as though it was designed pointedly to derail the entire film, except the film was off the tracks way before you get to that point.  An animated short of a woman who dies trying to flush an unflushable turd; some weird acid-trip for W, which winds up standing for WTF; and the incredibly boring, this-seriously-cost-5000-dollars-to-make \\"G for Gravity,\\" which features a POV shot of a surfer paddling out and then going underwater and apparently drowning, have already, by that point, sunk any hopes I had for the film either by being utterly ridiculous, boring (and imagine something only five minutes long giving you time to get bored), or, most often and the worst offense, just lazyfilm making.  There are a few winners here, but not enough to justify sitting through the entire two hours.  It does hold together as an indulgent art-house project, in the sense of representing much of what people stereotype art-house films as being (bizarre, plot-less, poorly made, \\"message heavy,\\" and mind-numbing) when they try to deride art-house films.  But as a horror film, ABCs of Death is a horrible, tragic failure on almost every level.  The worst part--the end credits promise a sequel in 2014.  Run.  Hide.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|After our local paper described this film as &#34;quickly descending into a nightmarish journey&#34; I just had to see it.  After watching it, I had to wonder if the guy who wrote that article had ever seen it.  It starts out so slowly that my kids fell asleep while watching it.  The next day, they watched the rest, and loved it!  I'm a fan of the Baum books, and found this movie to much more true to the books than what most people think of as The Wizard of Oz.  Even the tin man, lion, etc. were true to the drawings from the original series.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Our book club selected this recently, and I first thought, &#34;Great, a book about hiking-- I hope I can get through it.&#34; Cheryl Strayed turned that whole mental block into a passionate, emotional, gripping, and painfully real reading experience that truly grabbed my heart. I am now changed personally after reading that book. She shared such a deep level of personal depravity intertwined with the description and depth of the love she had for her mother, making the hiking journey she embarked on become the pinnacle of life-changing events. A beautiful, heart-wrenching read! When I finished it, all I wanted to do was contact Cheryl and give her a big hug for telling her story. It was such a wonderful experience being on the trail with her.

I just loved the interaction between all of the characters and I loved the main character's romance. There was some humor that made me laugh out loud at some points too! I think she did an amazing job at describing the dogs and how they acted, she nailed it! Of course I loved the mystery/suspense in the book as well, kept me turning the pages for more! Thanks Nora! A great read! I am now adding a bunch more of her books to my wishlist!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|It was interesting from the beginning to the end and I have just ordered 'Tis which will be about Frank's life in America.  I fell in love with Frank and was rooting for him all thru his young life.  It is hard to believe that life could be so difficult.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I dvr and watch Craig everyday.  Knowing how many years he has been a recovered addict, I just want to know where does he get his energy???  I love watching him and because he comes on tv so late at night, it's a good bet a lot of his viewers are in an altered state and it always seems like he is cognizant of that and is always messing with him.  He is just as refreshing in his book.  You feel like you've personally met him after reading the book and then watching his show.  His patriotism is very strong and he does not refrain from letting it known.  Loved reading about his history, growing up with his family (I would've loved to be a fly on the wall at dinner time!) and all the photos.  I appreciate him sharing, if you like his show, you'll love his book!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie was pretty good, I don't watch TV or follow any other news sources. As an avid reader of the books I was expecting the entire book in one movie. To my shock this is a trilogy, so I am waiting on the next movie now.
B008XCJ03K|3.0|I do like this album. Did I just call it an album? Wow. That's really a dated term isn't it. Well, this music made me think of poodles. Go figure.
B00C061I3K|1.0|I understand...try new things, and bravo to them for actually having the guts to experiment with music, but Daft Punk's sound has a reputation of energetic french disco-house and techno with a party vibe. The robot singing is awesome, but if you're going to put out a totally different, unrelated sound, why not release this under a new alias and let \\"Daft Punk\\" be remembered for what it was?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Once the story is over you'll want to know what happens next. Waiting for the sequel! Very good trilogy .
B00003JRCQ|4.0|You gotta be a Jane Austin fan to appreciate this movie.  It drags on for a while but ends nicely.
1476729719|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended it to lots of people. Our  book club read it and everyone either gave it a 4 or a 5.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Read it in 2 days!  Romance and sports (even if it was the Eagles!) is a great combo!  Can't wait to watch the movie now!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Match 3 games are my favorite and this one is at the top of my fave list. I've not played the timed version yet because I like being able to play a while, set the game aside, and come back to it without getting out of the game. If you like match 3 games, this one is definitely worth the $1.99!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Can't stop playing.  Good game for a quick break at work.  Need all those coins, and running the distance. I like the tunnels in this new version.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|my 2 year olds love Dr. Panda!  This game has plenty of games and activities to keep them busy....great characters...I love that Dad's are depicted in the grocery store!
B008Q00BOQ|5.0|The quality of this movie is  crispy HD. You will not believe that it was an online streaming. However, you need a faster internet connection (with a higher bandwidth to be able to achieve this.  Amazon Instant Video has been so updated that you may not miss s visit to that Redbox so soon.
B001PPLKI0|4.0|doesn't have all his greatest performances and could use less commentary but typical Elvis.  Nobody does gospel like Elvis.  Good buy
B005LAII80|5.0|I loved this movie. Over the top action, Karl Urban saying MAW MAW (Mama, the antagonist), Phantom Flex slow motion in the... slow mo (its an asthma inhaler that does some crazy stuff) scenes, a little bit of social commentary dashed in, and an ending that might come off as a letdown, but is really super cool. For those who have seen it, the song they used when a certain character is taking the &#34;secret escape route&#34; to the ground floor is said to be a slowed down Justin Beber song. go figure. Watch it, this is way better than Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern, and I might go out on a limb and say its better than Thor, which is what I feel to be the weakest of the Avengers films (that doesnt mean I didnt enjoy it, Ive seen it like 3 times now). I'm getting off topic, get this film, support it, hopefully we get Dredd Harder, and a Dredd Hard With a Judgement.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I have been playing this game for a couple years now. I love it. Air Hockey! Reminds me of when I was a kid
B008XG1X18|5.0|Should let ou know if I like a product or not.  So while I usually am thrilled with what I have gotten, this will be my last review because I hate to write this down .
B00947N6D8|5.0|I really didn't think I was going to watch this movie when I saw the previews; but when my friend rented it I ended up watching it! It was such a cute movie that I had to get a copy for myself to share with my friends and family!
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|I was given a copy of this book in return for an honest review.<br /><br />In all honesty, I would give this four and 1/2 stars as it was extremely difficult for me to get into the novel.  I was not truly invested in the characters until a bit over half-way through the book.  Once I got there I could not put it down and ended up regretting that there wasn't more.  I do not believe that my problems with the book were anything but the fact that this is not the typical genre that I read... it is very well written and developed.<br /><br />Sebastian is the story of a young man in Vienna.  Prior to WWI, he lost his leg due to an infection.  This novel follows him and his family through the years leading up to and through the war.<br /><br />Fischer's characters are very well rounded.  To be honest, I did not like most of them, just as I do not like most people in real life.  Sebastian's mother, grandmother, and most of the people in the novel, are full of frailty.  They are full of conflict within themselves.  Throughout the book, they grow based upon their experiences.  It is very realistic and I am impressed at the author's ability to write such full fledged characters.<br /><br />I was also very impressed with the amount and type of information in the book.  Fischer does a magnificent job of showing the tensions between the Jewish and gentile communities.  He delves into what happens to the common people during war.  In this book you do not see the typical heroes, you see very little of the soldiers, and you hear what is happening politically only as a citizen who was not involved would.  This was fascinating, as most of what I knew prior to reading Sebastian was political... not how the regular people would have seen things and the impact on them.  I would love to get my hands on Fischer's research in order to go more in depth on a few questions that I have.<br /><br />I believe that anyone who likes history and/or enjoys the study of human nature will greatly appreciate this book.iate this book.

0316056898|3.0|I have to say I was a little underwhelmed by this book.  I got it when it was on Kindle for 99 cents.  For that price, I'm glad I read it, but I'm also glad I didn't spend much more for it.  I really like Tina Fey and generally find her comedy very funny, but this book just did not resonate with me.  I was expecting a book chock full of laughs like Mindy Kaling's and Chelsea Handler's and while parts of it were certainly amusing, I think I only laughed out loud once.  It covers some surprisingly heavy topics like sexism in comedy, being a working mother and her personal struggles with whether or not to have a second child.  The stuff about sexism at SNL, while not exactly a revelation, was at least somewhat interesting.  The parts about how hard it is to be a working mother came across as really whiny & extremely lacking in self-awareness.  While I have no doubt that it hasn't been easy for her to balance an extremely busy career and parenthood, the reality is that Tina Fey has it better than 99.99% of women in America because she has far more resources to hire help (and also, I would imagine, more flexibility in her schedule since she is basically her own boss).  So all of her \\"anecdotes\\" about the hardships of working motherhood fell flat with me. I think die-hard fans of SNL and 30 Rock will probably enjoy the book more because there is some interesting behind-the-scenes info about Tina's role in those shows and the development of certain sketches and storylines. While I have watched & enjoy those series, I'm not fanatical about them and I found these parts interesting and fun to read but not gripping.  Unfortunately, these were the best parts of the book.  Other parts had a very defensive tone, as if she wrote the book directly to her haters (there's actually a chapter where she addresses rude emails she's received - I found it cringeworthy and unfunny) and felt like she had to justify every decision she's ever made.  And then there were the parts, like the working mother stuff mentioned above, where she was trying way too hard to come off as relateable to the \\"average girl.\\"  She's obviously not average and people buying the book know that.  I wish she had owned it a little more instead of being so defensive.

0439023491|2.0|I read and really enjoyed the first book in this series.  I had a hard time putting it down and I think I read it in a matter of days.  In contrast, it took me, oh, three months to get through this one?  I kept putting it down and picking up other books because I didn't find this very engaging.  The plot of this book is incredibly similar to the plot of the first book.  I don't want to say too much to avoid spoilers, but really its astonishing how much of the book is a retread of the first book. And while I suspect its a somewhat more common problem in the science fiction/fantasy realm its certainly possible to write a series of books like this that don't get repetitive (for example, I never found the Harry Potter series to be repetitive).  In addition, in the first book everything was shown to us in rich detail, in this book a lot of it is simply told to us instead of described in detail (there are a few exceptions, a particular outfit Katniss wears is a notable one).  Which is sort of ok because we're already familiar with it, but it makes the book a much less enjoyable read.  The last 20% of the book, where things really get interesting and the book starts to find a new plot, is incredibly rushed and much of it is summarized, in fact, its summarized to Katniss at the same time its summarized to us.  Also, I didn't mind it in the first book (again, when it was fresher), but I'm getting whiplash from the Peeta, Gale, Peeta, Gale, Peeta, Gale back and forth.  Make up your damn mind, girl.  I'll read the third book in the trilogy for the sake of completeness but I can't say I'm looking forward to it.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|My wife and I have seen this series on TV and wanted to watch it again and again whenever we feel like it.  Great buy and great seller.  Thank you.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The product is  very nicely constructed and has many photographs printed inside the book like case pages with quotes that would make any alien fan smile. The blu-rays contain two versions of the films one is the theatrical and the other is either a directors cut or special edition version with some cool extras. The separate extras are on two separate discs contain literally hours of backstage filming footage, documentaries and a bunch of other cool stuff that I can't completely recall at this time. After all is said it's a nice product that deserves to be purchased to experience an all in one alien collection. However this amazing package doesn't come without a serious flaw. The discs are in the pages of the book casing and in such a way that it makes it a pain to remove or place back the discs lucky it's blu-ray and is more resilient to scratching. But even so it shouldn't exist in the first place because it still is a inconvience to get a disc out of the case. You also may end up tearing the small paper like section holding the discs which is not cool and is a pain in the ass. But if you can overlook this major problem then you will most definitely love this collection if your a alien fan with all its content it's really hard not to. My final say is \\"Thank god [whatever you believe in] it's blu-ray format because the discs would have been scratched to s*** if it was DVD or something like that.\\"
B0095P29EG|4.0|Watched with 10 and 7 year olds after Avengers.  I was worried it may be too scary.  They thought Iron Man 3 was more scary.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Being the original Sparatus, he still is the best.  It is a shame that he passed away prior to the second season.  Watch a wonderful actor in his final role.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|My wife and I enjoy this musical concert a lot.  Almost like being there without really being there.  Thank you.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter season six was in my viewpoint much better then season four and five because I enjoyed the storyline for this whole season of Dexter.  People have said this is the religious season of Dexter and that he is looking for answers to many questions that he is pondering.  But as normal for me I will give you guys and ladies highlights and a few spoilers of the season six.  Season starts off with a bang with Dexter killing people, then is called to a crime scene and they have to open up the victim to see what is inside his stomache(buy the season to see for yourselves).  Debs personal life gets in way of her work after she is offered a promotion to boss.  Musuka gets a helper for this season and he proves to be up to no good (have to buy the season to see what I mean).  The cops get a lead on the religious killers going on the book of revlations and refer to as doomsday killers, Dexter ask God for a favor for his son.  Dexter starts to figure out the names of the killers and tries to hunt them down, Sam gives Dexter advice on how to let go of the darkness within his heart and try to forgive.  Dexter listens to the advice of Sam and forgives himself for the death of his brother Rudy.  Sam leaves Dexter his Bible and Dexter starts to read it looking for answers, then he finds a lead and goes to an old church to find the killers.  Deb making headway in theorpy and Dexter figures out the next victim of the killers, as season goes on Dexter fixes out Travis is working alone and the other killer is already dead.  Travis tries to send in a follower to do God's will, then Travis tries to kill Dexter in a religious mannor called the Lake of Fire but of course he survies.  Travis comes up with a final plan to do the sacrifice unless Dexter stops him,  he of course finds Travis and they fight then Dexter takes Travis to the church and choices to do what he does best to bad people, only one thing goes horribly wrong(you have to buy the season six DVD set to find out).  But speaking bluntly it's a hell of a cliffhanger my mouth dropped open.  What did it for me was all the religious stuff because I am Catholic and enjoy many aspects of the Bible and it's teachings.  Also forget about the bad reviews because of the intro on the DVD set if you truly love the show Dexter watch this season with an open mind and you will be blown away as much as I was and still enjoy every season of Dexter even the ones I gave four star ratings to because you have to look at the season as a whole not just each episode.  I was very pleased with this season can't wait to buy season seven when I have some extra money.king bluntly it's a hell of a cliffhanger my mouth dropped open.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was awesome! Puzzles that keep you entertained, I highly recommend skipping the hints, you will enjoy it more that way!
B00000IREA|5.0|Just the opening credits is worth the price of the movie.  A rather young Jane Fonda set the pace for the absolutely crazy movie.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Emma Chase does something brilliant in her debut novel that most writers of contemporary romance never even attempt - write a very raw and real look into the mind of a cocky, egotistical, man-slut on his journey to finding love.<br /><br />And it's no holds barred! Drew Evans is gods gift to women. No, seriously, ask him and he'll tell you. Repeatedly. But he earns it, and he's honest. He breaks the 4th wall and tells us, the readers, ALLLLLL about it. And everything else on his mind. About women, men, success, failure, sex. He thinks it, he shares.<br /><br />It's so astonishingly refreshing and hilarious that even when you want to slap him (and you will), you still laugh your ass off. You'd also screw him. Anytime. Anywhere. And for all his cocky egotistical crap, you still fall in love with him.<br /><br />This is his story. It's the story of how he got \\"the flu\\" and in the end it turns his perfect life upside down. Drew's flu has a name & it is Kate Brooks. For all his moaning, he's helpless against this illness. And we have a front row seat as this impossibly irresistible jerk is put threw his paces and falls head over heals in love then has to claw and fight to hold onto it.<br /><br />But have no fear, while the story and writing is immaculate, there is no angst here. Just the perfect story of a lovable cad who meets his match. And the best part: we get to watch. Kate is a wonderful heroine. Strong and smart, she is just the best. She doesn't just fall into Drew's arms and believe in the fairy tale - she makes him prove himself. It's amazing.<br /><br />My love for this story is without question. Trust me, you will rarely have this much fun reading a book. Even if you are reading it for the 5th time.<br /><br />Emma Chase is SO GIFTED and I know that this is just the beginning of what will be an amazing career for her. This style of writing with so much honestly from a character is beyond refreshing.<br /><br />It's a revelation.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It works well, I appreciate it very much.  I like all the versions that are available, they are very helpful.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|No wonder this was a Grammy winner. Dr. John continues to impress with this latest work. I would recommend it highly.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I don't watch TV unless it is truly a well-written piece - a quasi-work of art, even.  I do not have a lot of time to watch television and so when I do, I can't stand having my time wasted by the reality/competition-genre garbage that fills the primetime hours on most of the major American networks.  My tendency is to watch era-driven shows (Boardwalk Empire [1920s Jersey], Rome [Caesar's fall from grace], Mad Men [the 60s], Game of Thrones [a stretch, but let's say the Middle Ages meets fantasy land], etc.).  Long story short: I never thought a show about drugs could captivate my attention, but boy... was I wrong!<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, but I have never seen a character develop in such a remarkable way -- I cannot believe that AMC was able to take a tale of two meth cooks and develop their characters to such an extent.  (You will never see a character change so much - and in such a believable way - again, I don't think.)  This is definitely a character piece but with a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout all of the seasons.  Remarkable acting by Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston, especially in season 4 (which I think is the best so far, though I am not quite through the first half of the 5th yet).  Give this show a chance -- season 1 is slow and not great, but keep watching and once you get a few episodes into season 2, you'll be hooked and I am convinced that you too will share in my sentiment that Breaking Bad is by far, the best show on television.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I'm a big Shinedown fan,  but this is by far their best album yet.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I like this film because it actually teaches us something while entertaining us. People have value, regardless of what they look like or how they dress or even some of their &#34;bad&#34; habits. People have value and should be treated with respect. The real people who did the voices for the cartoon characters did their parts do well that you tend to forget who they are in real life. I really enjoyed this film!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|not as good as i had anticipated. there are a few laughs throughout the film but not nearly what i would have thought.
1400049628|5.0|Really. But also, this is a must have book for zombie fans. Now I'm by no means an expert critic so ill keep it short. Max Brooks approaches the unrealistic subject in a pretty realistic manner, which for me is what made this book so enjoyable. His reasons for why zombies are the way they are makes total sense, as does his methods for dealing with walking, reanimated, cannibal corpses. An enjoyable read purely for entertainment, but I can't help but think this book would ACTUALLY be a useful source of information should the dead arise. Also, the inclusion of a selection of &#34;recorded attacks&#34; throughout history was a nice touch, as if this book were written in a world where a zombie outbreak could/has/will happen.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I have every album Rod Stewart has out, and this is just as good as the rest. Worth the money.
B005MLP71Y|4.0|A good film for family or for anybody, Bee Movie is a good film for relaxation. It is not high drama or even a great adventure, but it is entertaining and a very original look at the lives of bees.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|If you like classics you will like this.  Hugh Jackman is outstanding and so is a cast of folks that I have never seen perform.  Russell Crowe's singing ability is questionable, but his acting skills shine as always. Our family enjoys musicals so for us this is a favorite.  You must like musicals to enjoy this film.  Great adaptation of a timeless work.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I expected more than what it gave me. I fell asleep each time I attempted to watch. Three times and I still didn't finish.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong, but for some reason, this version tends to freeze up. Guess you get what you pay for, and I can't really complain - it was free.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Minimal ads that you can easily close. Good game play with many options. You wouldnt be disappointed if you like solitare.
1609611543|5.0|There is no way to express how informative and how right the information in this book is. I dropped a quick 20 pounds just by giving up wheat. Now when I eat it, all these problems I previously had come right back, like dermatitis on my face, aches, pains, bloating. Just try it and you will be amazed at how wonderful you feel once this stuff gets out of your system. I no longer feel the urge to eat, eat, eat all day long and I don't overeat anymore, since giving it up. Great information in this book. I recommend it highly.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not over the top beyond reality action. Kept you interested until the end. Although you can tell who produced it, it was a very good movie that made you guess.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to install and use. Books download easily. Still trying to learn a few things but overall very happy with it.

B006W0QR1S|5.0|Every minute of Drive is completely thrilling, from the initial burst of energy it starts with down to the near ubiquitous tension that underlies nearly every moment. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've ever heard.
0385349947|4.0|Lean In had a lot of hype attached to it when it was published.  I was expecting some deep revelations.  I found little except examples of how Sheryl had overcome minor mistakes to make it big time.  Even her 2 marriages seemed to have a high gloss over them.  Though she tries hard to be part of the 99%, she never convinces me.  Her good luck, intelligence and pursuit of her goals are what led to her success.  I didn't need to read this book to know this.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Shame on the multinational corporations that refuse to talk on the subject.  And i give a major middle finger to Monsanto!
B00B6OEDS4|2.0|yeah, great album cover but that's about it.<br />What's the fuss and all the attention?<br />To my ears this sounds like C-grade Sade.<br />And if you dig this just check out any early (first ten years) Sade.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Wow, with all the hype I was sure I was going to like some part of this movie but I did not.  Jennifer Lawrence did not give an Oscar worthy performance (please see The Impossible with Naomi Watts - now THAT'S an Oscar caliber performance).  Very disappointed.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This was an excellent ending to an excellent season. I just hope we see more of Moriarty! Quality of the media was excellent as well.
B00005QGAT|3.0|Randomly in conversation the wife mentions things she used to have that have been lost and usually I can find them cheap on Amazon. Good job Amazon. This seller was quick and packaged it well. Product played with no problems.
B004IPPINW|3.0|An excellent film but the complete distortion of the female character as performed by Kate Hudson undermined the serious political theme.  Hudson is a weak actress even in light comedies but to expect her to bring off a complex characterization is foolish on the part of the filmmakers.  The book deserves 4 stars -- not the film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever every one in my class loves it if you have heard about it I<br />Bet you want it. It should/ not be a 4 and a half  rating it should be a 5 star rating.<br />You will agree when you get the game

B007QA3AH2|4.0|Really love this movie - just a good bundle of not-so-serious fun. Excellent Star Trek parody that can entertain the whole way through.

B000I3SYEI|5.0|After watching the new Star Trek movie &#34;Into Darkness&#34;, I wanted to watch the Wrath of Khan to refresh my mind regarding Khan and Kirk's ongoing battles.  I bought this movie knowing I would like it and it gave me a nostalgic look back.  I loved every minute of this movie.  My adult daughter watched it with me and although she was never a Star Trek fan, she really enjoyed it, too.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Saw this twice in 3D at theaters in separate places with different people. One companion was a mature woman with a fondness for the MGM Glinda and the other was a 25 year old RPG devotee. We all loved it.<br />This movie is really all about the love. The people who made it love the original source material, the 1939 movie, and movies making in total from the earliest flickers to the latest thing in 3D CGI madness. There is even a nod to \\"The Horse in Motion\\" the earliest known moving picture. There are plenty of reviews about the actors and story but I will forgive a lot in a movie that has musical water reeds and where the two most compelling characters are a living china doll and a flying monkey dressed like a bellhop.<br />Only money keeps me from buying a 3D system so that I could enjoy those wonderful sepia toned opening credits with their flat bubbles on sticks and strings and assorted vortexes pulling me into unknown places in the comfort of my home.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Just like the real thing! I feel like some items are missing though. Controls need some getting used too but are smooth.

B00BTJMS1A|1.0|This app was worthless:<br />1) no instructions, tutorial, or help.  It starts with someone in bed - and I am to do what?

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|where did that two hours go!? great puzzle game. It really does suck you in and its hard to quit playing
0399226907|5.0|Ordered for my Mother to use as a gift she is very concerned that books be educational and engaging even for very young children.  She was exceedingly pleased with this choice.
034554398X|5.0|I am about 70% through this book and have finished the first two books. I have to say that so far this book is my favorite. It was hard to get through the first and second. So many names, so many kingdoms, so many houses. But I really love how the author writes each chapter from  different person's perspective. Since I have a kindle, I can't jump forward to sneak a peek and that makes it even more fun. I love that each character's chapter is like a tv episode and you may have to wait several chapters to see what happens next. It really keeps me engrossed (my family would say obsessed). I think these books are as graphic as they need to be. The sex and violence is tame compared to some. I just love these stories so much, I don't want them to end!
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It really held my attention for the entire length of the movie. The good guys won!
B00AECDDYY|4.0|Seems simple enough, but the pace picks up quite rapidly and before you realize it 3 hours are gone. I am still on the beginner level so I am sure the next levels are very challenging
B006RED4GA|5.0|and that's something most people have forgotten how to use when watching a movie.<br /><br />As in my previous movie review about \\"John Dies At the End\\" this movie is a perfect example of what I mean when I say people don't like to think when they watch a movie anymore. This film was absolutely amazing for a ghost story and about as real as you can expect in this genre. An old hotel where a death occurred and two hotel workers just trying to put in their days work, loathing the decisions they made in life that made them hotel clerks, and just trying to find something more for themselves aside from their boring jobs. Luke works on his ghost hunting website and Claire is writing a book. To keep themselves entertained they depend on each other and have a strong friendship. Claire likes to support Luke and finds ghost hunting a fun way to spend her long work hours. It's not until strange things start happening that things change for the both of them. This movie has questions but ALL of the answers are given in the story. This movie requires attention be paid to detail and the characters dialogue. Even the ending scene holds a clue to the fate of the main character. EVERYTHING is in the film and that's what makes it so freaking brilliant!<br /><br />To persons that weren't listening,paying attention, or trying to piece together the clues and hints, all they can say is \\"It was slow,it was boring,this is a bad horror film,it made me think and my brain hurts,I didn't get it what happened?\\". This movie has so many elements to it you really need to PAY ATTENTION.<br /><br />So here it comes \\"The story\\" and yes there will be *Spoilers!*<br /><br /> The Yankee Peddler Hotel is closing down. It's the last weekend of the hotel being opened. It's also the last time Luke and Claire get to find out if there is really a ghost or not in the hotel. It would be a real accomplishment for either of them as neither of them have accomplished anything truly amazing in their lives. It be their own personal victory to finally achieve something in the time they spent at the hotel. Finding the ghostly Bride is the perfect going away present for them. In the last days of the hotel Claire befriends an ex actress/psychic that gives her a small bit of assistance about the ghost of the hotel. The Psychic tells Claire to stay away from the basement and that there are 3 spirits in the hotel. Claire is clueless as to who they are but the psychic can sense it faintly. After some strange events occur on the last night Claire and Luke decide to kick up their ghost hunting game and venture into the basement to connect with the ghost. Low and behold they get what they asks for. Claire can sense the ghost because she is sensitive just like the Psychic ex actress. Except she can see them but she can't tell the future or predict events. For some reason these spirits are attracted to Claire and it's because they are sensitive to her. To Luke he doesn't see or hear the ghosts but the Claire she can. It's the time she spends with the Psychic that stimulates this ability in her. Before she was able to see the ghost she was able to sense then mildly or experience phenomenon where she heard them (like being attracted to the basement and the piano).<br /><br /> The spirits were attracted to her energy. Towards the end of the film when Claire becomes more sensitive she is able to hear the ghost and begins following her voice thinking it's the Psychic. Claire finds herself in the basement where she was warned not to go. As she is sensitive to ghost the spirit of the \\"Old Man\\" finds his way to her energy and Claire being frighting falls down the stairs and hits her head. When she regains herself she sees is aware that the ghostly presence of the old man is following her. Clair runs to the back exit of the basement and closes the door behind her. The door starts moving and she hears banging and is even more frightened and the last thing she sees is the Ghost Bride before her and sheblacks out and dies of an asthma attack. The 3 ghosts that the Psychic saw in the basement were The ghost bride,the old man, and Claire herself. Although the psychic said she see's events sometimes not as they are now but in the future. Her vision was of Claire's demise. In the final ending scene at the window we faintly see Claire standing looking out the window then the door slams shut. In reality the knocking and pounding Claire heard at the door was Luke trying to rescue her after he heard her screaming. Luke did not see the ghost or feel them because he was not a sensitive like Claire was. To him the basement was just a basement. There was no spirit of an old man or a bride there. To Claire who was sensitive she could hear and see them and they were attracted to her for that reason. Although the only thing that is never explained is what the ghost want from Claire and the Phsychic ex Actress never mentions anything about it as she is stunned by what she sees will happen in the basement with Claire's death.<br /><br />The Innkeeper's is a great movie with a very sad ending. It can be a reward for those that pay attention or a just a waste of time for those that weren't. This isn't exactly an upbeat film but a film that tries to add a bit of realism by creating realistic characters and more believable story instead of just bumps in the knight. In a way it's almost like some of the audience is Luke who doesn't see anything special or feel anything special from the movie and the rest of the audience is Claire that sees all these things going on and take in what's happening.blacks out and dies of an asthma attack.

1568363931|5.0|This is possibly the definitive book about bento for anyone who wants to learn about bento, learn to prepare bento and eat delicious & healthy bento.  You won't find the cute little animal themed bento some mom's make for their kids.  Instead you'll find simple recipes for tasty dishes that can be put together in as few as 15 minutes (with a little practice) - about the time it takes to make a sandwich, wash an apple and bag up a few Oreos.  Developing a bento \\"stash\\" and learning some shortcuts can help you put together bento quickly & easily for you and your family.  I have several bento books on my shelf and I love them all.  This is my \\"go to\\" when I need to learn a new technique, find substitutions & variations or just for a good read.
B0054SMID0|4.0|This movie was very slow for the first 20 minutes. The acting was fine but the plot was not well planned.
B004X1U7DM|5.0|This CD is a very eclectic mix of traditional NDN chants and songs that are so artistcally and cleverly put to modern day rock, jazz, classical, pop, dance and newage rifts, tempos, beats and melodies that can take you anywhere from a relaxed soothing state of being to a uplifting want to get up and dance feeling and everywhere in between. Since I purchased this CD I have found it hard not to stop listening to it over and over and this is definately a CD that I would recommend to my friends and family....
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Tom Cruise delivers again with an action packed sequel. Good story with great supporting cast. I watch every few months when I need a good dose of Cruise.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Erotica doesn't get any better than this.  EL James has created a sensual, sexy character in Christian.  He's flawed but so desirable.  Read them all!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|The plot on this movie was not predictable like they some times can be. Good solid entertainment and action.<br />Good entertainment value
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I got this to put on my kindle fire after seeing someone in church using it.  It has a notes section and you can use it to take notes from the sermons while the person is preaching.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|A great movie.  I see all the Star Trek movies.  I would highly recommend this. You wont be disappointed it was great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Highly recommend.  This book is wonderful.  I'm not even a kid & I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series.  A must read.
B007RKPO84|4.0|This is the thrashy Kreator that we know and love and not the whiny \\"experimental\\" Kreator of the 90's. Great production and everything you would want in a German thrash attack. The four stars just comes down to songwriting, and I have to admit I didn't find the songs as memorable as the last couple of releases. Still worth every penny. Support these guys.
B000TGCR3S|5.0|This film is beautiful. The vistas of Treasure Town are gorgeous. The story of black and white is not novel but every step of the way is in this telling. Societal novelty, technological and environmental novelty all breath life and meaning into this story of balance. For a deviation from the norm pick this up, you won't be sorry.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Bought this for my daughter.  She is a history  buff and she just adored  the movie.  I would recommend this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Highly recommend.  This book is wonderful.  I'm not even a kid & I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series.  This is a thrilling conclusion.  A must read.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|While not a Tolkienite, I enjoyed The Hobbit for what it was, a good story.  I saw this in the cinema and then at home.  It is heavily padded with orc killing if not fabricated with 'novel' appearances (Galadriel, Radogast).  Central to every scene are the improbable appearing dwarves with terrible makeup and hairpieces.  It is peculiar that most of the dwarves look like clowns or Snow White versions, while Thorin is noble appearing in bearing, albeit short.  The pacing is poor and  the beginning meeting with them in the Shire was ponderous.  Radogast plays a slapstick role, which I happened to enjoy, but others might not.  The killing of orcs in Moria is so numerous as to become not just gratuitous, but boring.  I also noted quite uneven sound, very very loud alternating with muddy quality in the speech on the home version, it made me think I was watching a Robert Altman movie.<br /><br />In short, pretty good, but slow and a necessary evil to get to the end of the story in the subsequent parts
0880796863|2.0|The box and the paper of cards it's ok, but the images are dull, not well defined as in \\"Miniature Rider Waite Tarot Deck\\" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0913866598/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2). It looks like a photocopy.
B00006DEFA|5.0|A great movie.  I had seen it myself and my daughter asked for it as a Christmas gift.  I agree.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the most sensual & consuming book trilogys I've ever read.  Christian Grey is simultaneously the hottest & most flawed guy you could ever hope to meet.  The entire series is a MUST READ!!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have told so many folks that this is a great big band sound and I love the songs on this CD. I had this on the car non stop when traveling. I love to sing along. I have really enjoyed the title song \\"To Be Loved\\". I think anyone would enjoy this but it is a must<br />for middle age who will remember some of the songs from watching old Frank Sinatra movies.<br />I enjoy the sound and I enjoy feeling young again when I listen to it. I loved to watch old movies when I was a kid so some of the songs trigger those great memories. There is nothing old about the music, it is fresh and bright sounding. You are going to love Michael buble singing \\"To Be Loved\\".
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|The movie was Great, but it uses God's name in vain - one time. And it did not have to do that. Other than that, it was an aweson movie, it will keep you on the edge of your seat on some things...
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I started to read this book and found that some words were left out - at first I tried to ignore it and tried to fill in the blanks myself, but later on I couldn't remember what words or names I used and decided that I wasn't enjoying this at all - I moved on to another book which I thoroughly enjoyed - no problems at all - the only problem was that I didn't want to put it down!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What a fantastic conclusion to a sexy hot trilogy.  I want Christian Grey for my own with all of his kinks & flaws.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Vikings is Sons of Anarchy 1000 years ago. It's well written, especial for the History Channel, and somehow they make you cheer for them, even though they pillage and murder everybody. For anyone who loves SOA, this is a must!
B0039OC64M|2.0|This story seemed far fetched and lacked the ability to hold my interest, I think it could have been told in a better way and the acting stunk.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read !!!!!! Very romantic with an interesting twist· At first Wasn't too sure but once I started I couldn't put it down
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book really spoke to me.  I have lately been very imaginative with my creativity and it's nice to see that the world is build upon the curiosity and drive of forefathers like Tesla.  Best piece of advice:  If it works in your head, make it exactly as you see it.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Good movie enjoyed it lots of action, Clint Eastwood played his part very well. Interesting movie.. It has a good story line.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I really like this game and it is cool to see if I can get the highest score in only sixty seconds
B000IDEORY|5.0|Love this movie!!! &#34;Don't Ever Put Baby in a Corner!!&#34; This has to be one of my all time favorite movies....
B000PC0S5K|4.0|let me start by saying that I'm a huge E.Tolle fan.  I actually read this book first, and it had an amazing effect on me at the time.  I really loved it.  A few years later, I re-read both The Power of Now and A New Earth.  The Power of Now was definitely the ground-breaking work, and much of A New Earth is re-wording the same concepts.  Great book, but not The Power of Now
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a fan of Jillian Michaels and after having twins, I wanted to get back into shape. I tried other workouts but always got so bored with them that I would quit eventually. 30 Day Shred holds my interest and I find myself enjoying it the entire time BUT it is very challenging!! There is a downside to this, though. It is very hard on your knees and I am only on Workout 1. I have taken a few days off from working out due to my knees hurting so badly.
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|I Understand the basic concept....tap the guy....tap a door...upgrade what you can afford at the start. Then tap the dungeon door &amp; enter. Play matching game trying to match swords when an enemy appears...try to match keys when you are at a chest. OK.Sounds simple enough until you try to meet the objectives - one is to open a chest with a skeleton key.There are keys to match but this doesn't meet the objectives.....so then you use a key from the storage on above right side (if there is one)....this also DOES NOT MEET THE OBJECTIVE!!!! I have yet to see any other key so how do you&quot;meet the objective&quot;?I think some kind of guide would be helpful as well as some kind of chart so you know what the other things are that end up in that storage section on the right. Except for the key the rest of the items are unrecognizable blobs &amp; scrolls, some with cryptic markings....What are they? Tap on them to use.... but why? Who knows what you may be activating......?<br />Keep going to the dungeon for the matching game to earn gold &amp; stuff to be able to upgrade your weapons.....<br />Not a bad time-waster if you don't mind having little clue as to what the game wants you to do.....<br />A HELP SECTION WOULD BE NICE........you know....things like rules, descriptions, the point of it all...? LOL it WAS free so can't really do much complaining.....<br />I'll up my rating if a help menu appears.....otherwise, just 2 stars
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|This is a classic flic. I remember when it came out. It never loses my interest whether I am 7 or 41....
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable. Interesting and clever dialogue, great scenery, satisfying (and humorous) ending. A true western with heart. Deduct half a star for undeveloped female character who delivers not much more than annoying screams.
B009FZFONO|5.0|great acting, great writing, I dying to see season 4. I love how they introduce new characters without messing up the main theme of the show.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Very colorful and action was great!  I hope in the near future that there will another John Carter II with the continuation of where it was left off.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it. Just hate when last number is what I need for bingo  and I don't get it.  Slots are great way to try for extra Cash.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The content and characters are amazing, it my favorite Nicholas sparks book to date, simply addicting.
0345803493|5.0|i will recommend this book to everyone i really enjoy reading it couldn't put it down, i would of like this story to keep on going
B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|I heard about this movie and some of the history so I had to get the film.<br /><br />I found the movie an I opener into how other countries treat the native born, this is also a sad bit of history but the film was very interesting in how young children know right from wrong and the journey they took upon themselves to get back home.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 4!!! I AM ALWAYS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT.!! WOW IT IS REALLY REALLY GREAT!!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|a suspenseful tale i couldnt put down.  very well written making me find more books the author wrote in order to consume more of her work.

B00BSBUZT6|5.0|As a long time Eagles fan I really enjoyed experancing this DVD.  The film takes you from the beginning of the band through the personnel changes while you listen to their amazing harmonies and music.  It shows the good and the bad that any band has to deal with and it is an in your face look from the inside out of this great band.  I would recommend it to anybody that enjoys the history of music.
B009ANP48G|5.0|I really like doing bussiness with you guys because even if i didnt keep the movie it was not the right you guys had the time to respond me thank you
B006LSZECO|5.0|although i craved a different ending, i suppose its the only way it could go in a real world, so bravo for Flynn
B00CRR5YA0|4.0|I may have jumped the gun on this one. The length is about 45 minutes. The music is good, but not as good as the first, special edition Start Trek score by MG. Is there a special edition of this one coming soon? Time will tell.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I am totally shocked by how much I loved this story. I have bought so many books lately and end up never finishing them. This book was absolutely amazing. FINALLY!!!!!!!! N
B00BWJ6JO4|3.0|it was good but the book is much better i would recommend this to any one with kids are that like this kind of movie
B000JMKTLO|5.0|the lead is rich and flawed, with no apologies.  very well tapestried read, couldnt put the book down, it was another great read by Flynn
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game so much it is so fun and it dosnt cause any viroses so<br /> it is agreat game you can have so much fun but I would not recommend it to anyone younger than a 3rd grader because it could influence them to do bad things and run from the cops but I think it is a very fun game.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|This edition of the aliens franchise shows how the monsters were created in the first place, and it is very interesting and thought-provoking.  I highly recommend it.  There are a few swear words and some sexual innuendos, so be forewarned.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Steven Spielberg's LINCOLN is a movie that requires rapt audience participation.  It requires some knowledge or understanding of the period and the issues at hand, and expectation that you are about to witness the likes of a stage play made for the screen.  Spielberg's deft imagery, photographed as always by stellar cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, is canvased in shadows of dark and light, perhaps emphasizing the pallor that hangs over the country after four years of war and thousands of deaths.  Lincoln, in the unenviable position of making a choice between ending slavery or ending the war, knows that any outcome wherein the war ends prior to passing the 13th Amendment will likely make the Amendment null and void since peace terms agreed to prior to a vote are likely to include the South's desire to keep its slaves.  Thus, the political game is again mired in the dingy mud and dirt of vehement disagreement over ending more needless soldiers' deaths or freeing countless slaves.  Tony Kushner's script is a eloquent reminder that just like today, politics and progress come at a great cost.<br /><br />The film is a 'talker' and requires solid listening skills as I found the audio to be substandard for a lot of the dialogue.  Daniel Day-Lewis is a masterful Lincoln, but the requirements of the role (him working an American accent from older days along with Lincoln's soft-spoken manner) work against the microphone, and I often had to repeat part of the film just to catch a gist of what was said.  It is one of the major disappointments with this film, as every pause brought me out of the 1865 world Spielberg and his crew worked so hard to recreate, and back into my living room.  That aside, the movie is full of terrific performances and Lewis again is worthy of the Oscar that was again bestowed upon him.  Sally Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, caught between the loneliness of being a President's wife and the tragedy she's had to endure losing a son.  Their marriage having become a struggle, Field is fairly adept at traversing that line between appearing completely manipulative and sadly victimized.  An interesting appearance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (an actor I'm enjoying more and more as he ages) as Lincoln's eldest son, adds a nice touch of father-son angst, and another layer to Lincoln's character.  Tommy Lee Jones to me is always Tommy Lee Jones, and is fun to watch, no matter who he is playing.  He has a personality that captures the camera, whether you like him or not, and he owns the scenes in which he appears.  However, it is David Strathairn who holds this film's balance in his hands.  As Secretary of State Seward, every push in the script comes from him, and it is his job to somehow deliver lines of expository dialogue informing the audience of how these stakes add up to a cohesive problem over and over.  And each time, he reminds you why he is one of our most unheralded and unknown actors.  Along with the veteran presence of Hal Holbrook, this ensemble puts together a rewarding journey if you're willing to stick with it.<br /><br />Lincoln is rated PG-13 for some violence and is really not for children.  Kids will likely not be able to sit through this.
B0027MJU00|4.0|main character isnt as in depth as her previous leads were, but once again she weaves her tale eloquently and suspensefully
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Solid gameplay. Fun. There's othing to picking it up. I like it. I recommend picking it up for casual play.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I downloaded this game to my kindle because it was one of the top 10 favorites on Amazon. I really enjoy it and find the constant 'goals' and 'challenges' enticing enough to keep pulling me back. Sometimes it gets a little boring waiting for things to grow... but overall... a lot of fun.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This app works great and totals fractions very nicely.<br />Easy to use, and a very valuable tool for teaching my kid how to do fractions.

After that we are both so into it, I keep coming back for more series. Well thought out, all that u expect but with surprises once u find out the plot. Your every day people type of movie.

B00CS65JS2|1.0|Up until this album, I have been a Daft Punk fan for a long time. I was so looking forward to a new album. I heard the single \\"Get Lucky\\" and hated it. My first thought was \\"Is this really Daft Punk?\\". But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and still looked forward to the release of this album. Against my better judgement, I saw this at the store on sale and figured what the heck. Worst $10 I've ever spent. It's not even going be ripped into my digital collection. I'm going to give this away to any unsuspecting victim I can find. This album is nothing like their previous work, which I was looking forward to more of. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed. It's a 70's light disco throwback album that has absolutely no appeal to me whatsoever. Sorry guys, I can't get behind this work.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Very predictable, but harmless way to pass time.  Got the feeling everyone was just calling it in.  Barbra has become a caricature of herself.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|After reading the book I watched the movie. Although the movie was very well done, it is simply not possible to do the whole story in a 2 hour movie.  If you liked the movie then you must read the book to read understand Pi's fantastic adventure.
B009K2SLYG|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in close to 20 years. I looked all over town and not a single copy anywhere! Thanks to Amazon.com, I can watch it anywhere I can get a WiFi signal. If you like British comedy, you will love Monty Python and The Holy Grail!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I find myself downloading all sorts of books for my Kindle. Being that I'm overly ambitious, there's a great many that I have yet to read. Fortunately for me, I was very much intrigued by Mr. Patrick's book, and began to read it immediately. It's SHOCKINGLY good. What I received was not only an absolutely fascinating read on the life of a fascinating and profoundly gifted inventor, but it also was a bit of a pep talk as well. Mr. Patrick let's you know that anyone can succeed and be a modern day Tesla, Ford, etc.<br /><br />This book is a quick and insightful read. You'd be absolutely remiss not to download it to your Kindle and start reading right away. You will absolutely not be disappointed. Be warned though, it's interesting and well written to the point that you'll more than likely end up devoting all the time necessary to read it in one shot. It is my sincerest hope that this author writes more books on important people of the past so that a desire to learn of these great people can be kindled, and maybe, just maybe, the spark of curiosity will be ignited in another potential inventor.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South is a superb depiction of this wonderful novel.  Beautifully casted, acted and filmed, its nuances are right on the mark.  This is a treasure.
B006G35EEC|5.0|We (the parents) watched this with our two girls (8 and 9 years old).  Everyone was throughly entertained.  Also, less schlocky than the recent Lohan version.
B003XZ4F78|4.0|I loved this collection of cartoons and the other Latin American themed Disney Film theThree Caballeros. A must see for an Disney fan.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|We enjoyed watching this well directed movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis could not have done a better acting job.  It is a great history lesson for those of us that sometimes forget all of remarkable things Lincoln did for the U.S.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Richard Dawkins is an atheist, but he is also many other things. He is a scientist, a gifted writer, and a man who is willing to share his years of fact finding and research, along with educational background, to debunk a lot of myths that far too many take on face value without much effort to look at known facts or consider different points of view.<br /><br />The book is educational, if nothing else, but it is also instrumental in giving readers a fresh way of thinking that can serve them well throughout many aspects of life.  Dawkins addresses many myths, and then presents scientific evidence to refute or debunk them. Whether you choose to agree with him, change any of your convictions, or retain your current perspectives is up to you. To avoid reading a book like this because one is afraid that they may learn something that will make them uncomfortable, is akin to sticking ones head in the sand. Regrettably, far too many people chose to close their minds.<br /><br />Very well written. Highly recommended.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Great movie and really makes you think about your life and faith. The tiger was a huge role in the movie which of course i loved.
B005HSL626|5.0|recommend for everyone. cant put this down never bored, anyone can play this game even my 4 yr old niece loves it
B0067R0APK|3.0|Maps will not function.  When I click on the map image, I always get a blank map display.  Impossible to play a time lapse clip.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Awesome and full of action that is not so bad just punching and kicking adventuresome to the kindle fire HD awesomely paid for
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is not like the Xbox and PC edition of minecraft. There is also no mods or downloading worlds. Get Survivalcraft but NEVER get worldcraft. In this game the world's are small, no villagers, no potion, no buckets. May not be the best game for you.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|This is one of the few books I have read that gives an adequate representation to the  german/ austrian side of the conflict. The other books on the topic that I've read seem to have too much of a victor's viewpoint. This was more evenhanded. The immense stupidity displayed by all the parties involved is scary though.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved every page of this whole series!  It is fast paced and a new twist around every corner.  A definite read for you adrenalin junkies.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Nice app. Gives accurate readings for temp and humidity. Love the way it transforms from day to nite. Wish it gave wind forecast.
0375413405|5.0|This is possibly the best cook book I own. Everything is explained really well and I love that some of the recipes also offer variations. It's pretty easy to follow and everything I've made from this book has turned out wonderfully. People think I'm a gourmet cook at home!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Want to blow off steam?? This is a great way to forget everything else for a while!! It is truly addicting!
1608871452|5.0|Love these books. But I have to prattle on and on for 12 more words until I run out of spa
B005I6EU48|4.0|I love the way this cover resembles an old book. It fits nicely, and is sturdier than I thought it would be. My only complaint is that my Kindle occasionally slips out of one of the straps, but that's just a minor annoyance.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Was believable, yet did did entertain, yet carried a message in the storyline. Made for a enjoyable movie to watch and relax.
B002UKVO3U|5.0|Always loved this movie. It was the first anime movie I owned. A must have for building an anime collection.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I am enjoying this game even though I had to buy complete game when I could not seem to go any further.  Good graphics.jja
B0000541B2|4.0|I bought one of these as a gift for a buddy,<br />It was okay in their opinion,<br />I was glad it worked just fine for them!!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great way to enjoy a relaxing day.  If you love horses and appreciate the hero's of our wars, you'll love this story.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Seth is a genius! And while I knew this was going to be a funny film before I watched it (after all the creator of Family Guy kills me every Sunday) - I didn't expect it to be SOOOO FUNNY! I cried and rolled on the floor on several occasions. If you love Family Guy you'll love this one. It's really funny!
B000ICXQXI|5.0|The film loaded quickly, and the picture was very clear. I really had a good time watching an old school movie like this.
B001Z65KNA|3.0|Robocop is an all time memory for plenty of us,<br />In this set the original robocop plays in 2 of the movies,<br />A different guy plays in the other movie,<br />Robo cop is funny with his movements; but this movie is more than funny,<br />Robo cop can still feel emotions even though he is half machine,<br />Who knew machines had hearts?
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|Love it. So glad I heard it on a plane flight and was able to purchase it from you.<br />Thanks
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This film has its laugh out loud moments, and I'm happy to say that its more often than not. It's a very funny film. The cast is brilliant and although it doesn't feel like Knocked-Up 2, its funnier - in my opinion. Loved it!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Read the books first, which always makes me skeptical. my husband even really enjoyed this movie and we have complete opposite taste in films.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Simply the best book I have ever read. Such an amazing insight to life in Kabul and the horrors of the Taliban. May they never rise again.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It Works very well. Charges my ipad/iphone as quick as connecting directly to the wall with original charger. Very recommendable for those on the go most of the time.
B009GX69RK|1.0|New writers, who knows but the story lines are bad and unlike the first season miss their mark almost every time.
1616550414|5.0|Of course this is a nerd item for hardcore zelda fans, but for those it's great. Looks very significant and cool, feels high quality and to me looks much better then the limited &#34;leather bound&#34; version of the book. Everything is presented with much love for details and gives a really nice overview of the Zelda universe we all love so much.
B00BW6SOIQ|1.0|i generally like james spader, despite his characters' edginess. but this was too gross. i was alternately bored and outraged.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Once again, being able to watch without commercials is awesome. There is no better place to find a great deal on such a popular item! Get it now.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's very handy to be able to open up a PDF and be able to read it on the Kindle.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I have always loved Tom Hanks as an actor.  In this movie, he is exceptional playing multiple good and evil characters.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|I didn't love Goodwin in it, but the other three were good. It dealt with the theme of adultery interestingly.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I must say that being able to watch my favorite show in HD without commercials is fantastic! Buy this season one set from Amazon and get a great deal on a highly rated tv show!
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I really like this show.  However, they need to write it a bit different next season because it is crazy to think people keep coming out of the woodwork following him.  It's like, when does it stop and who is the next cult follower going to be and how does a person in prison get that many people to follow them.  Also, it is crazy to think that they couldn't put him in prison and keep him in solitary confinement so the killing would stop.  I love Kevin Bacon and that is one of my reasons for watching this show.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Good entertainment!  Good versus evil type of movie, with plenty of twists in the story line.  You will enjoy it.
B00BESM14U|3.0|This was sweet,stylish and mediocre. I like Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller most of the time. Their performances were moving.
B00BUT5I84|2.0|The quote in The Hunt for Red October describes this mess perfectly; \\"You arrogant ass. You've killed *us*!\\" I've seen this band many times and I was getting annoyed at Jared's arrogance.  This is Thirty Seconds to Mars \\"Capricorn One's\\" Fake mission, return to base!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love the actors and the acting.  Also, the writers are great and I think they have written this to where you can actually believe that this could happen.  Claire Danes is great.  I still think the writers are the ones that have made this show successful.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|To be honest the movie title failed to catch my attention, and I didn't think a movie about news would be much fun but I was completely wrong! For all you chick flick lovers out there, this is a good one ;) The lead guy's hot, Rachel McAdams is exceptional with her performance, and the plot's funny and inspirational. Give \\"Morning Glory\\" a chance!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this. I refused to believe it was as bad as the critics said, but they were correct.
B000I8G5NA|4.0|If you are searching for hidden meanings or deep metaphysical Enlightenment.... try Jersey Shores.....  if you want decent, enjoyable, and semi mindless fun.... it's a good movie!
1577314808|5.0|it always so nice to read a great book especally one like this! thankyou, okay six more words there. lol
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Everyone's always skeptical to buy something at first- I knew I was. I've always been a big fan of Demi Lovato, but I didn't like her last album that much except for the second half of it. This album is AWESOME! Its been the only album that an artist has released in which I actually liked every song.<br /><br />Heart Attack- It's a great song! Catchy and it actually has a meaning. The sequel to \\"Give Your Heart A Break.\\" Lead Single.<br /><br />Made In the USA-  Its supposed to be the second single that will be released, and I really like this one too.<br /><br />Without the Love- I love this one. \\"And you work so hard to get me just to let me go. Yeah, you put me in the spotlight just to steal the show. And you try to take me home like your Demagio\\" I love these lyrics.<br /><br />Neon Lights- Same lyrics all the way through. The thing is though, its so catchy, you dont care. \\"Please still my heart cause its freaking out.\\" Haha :)<br /><br />Two Pieces- This song really has a meaning and the chorus is very catchy. Hard work is evident in this one.<br /><br />Nightingale- One of the slow songs. I really like this song. CAN YOU BE MY NIGHTINGALE? THe chorus is really catchy.<br /><br />In Case- Another Slow ballad. Its not my favorite and I feel like I'm trying to get through the verses. I love the chorus though. I like this one.<br /><br />Really Don't care- I like the Duh duh DUH DUH DUH Duh at the beginning. :) Cher lloyd is awesome. Song is catchy.<br /><br />Fire Starter- Its one the least popular ones, but I really like this song too. DEMI's sassy side.<br /><br />Something that we're not- Sassy. I like this song alot. Its catchy catchy. The message it gives may not be the best, but artists have to have fun!<br /><br />Never been hurt- I read that people think this is their least favorite. The song is really good either way. Same concept as the song unbroken.<br /><br />Shouldn't Come Back- My favorite on the album. This song was dedicated to her dad. My dad left me when i was young and this reminds me of him. \\"Maybe you shouldn't come back to me.\\" I love this song so much, you'll never know. Its another slow song, but has a catchy chorus.<br /><br />Warrior- I keep thinking i'm listening to Christina Aguilera's songs. Its a beautiful song and I love it.<br /><br />Awesome Album, my favorite being Shouldn't Come Back and Without the Love.ft me when i was young and this reminds me of him. \\"Maybe you shouldn't come back to me.\\" I love this song so much, you'll never know.

B00APUYWYA|4.0|It wasn't a fantastic movie, of course. But it was enjoyable, uplifting, fun and funny. It was worth watching, I thought.
0470876417|4.0|We read this in my Entrepreneurship classes and I enjoyed the book. I still have it and would recommend it to others.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very fun will have you addicted. Great for all ages. You can compete against your facebook friends. I have it on several services.
B002LU0E26|1.0|S....L....O....W............ We were so bored with this pointless movie. Was excited to see Man of Steel until we saw this movie.
B004CHURRS|4.0|I recently experienced the Met HD Live Stream of the McVickar production of Giulio Cesare with Natalie Dessay as Cleopatra, and was alternately curious and dismayed at what I can only call its 'over-production'.  There was so much to look at, the music was almost left in the distance.  So I decided to simply listen to Ms. Dessay, rather than being concerned if she was going to wrinkle her brow while emoting (an 18-year-old Cleopatra wouldn't have done that) or how many hours of yoga (she talked about this during the break) it took for her to acquire such nicely toned arms.  In that respect, this CD does not disappoint.  In fact, after listening to it a number of times during the past week, I can comfortably say that, though purists may with justification complain that not all the arias of Cleopatra are included in the CD, or that Ms. Dessay may at times seem to do almost as much improvising as ornamentation, that this is a pleasure to listen to.  Ms. Dessay has a lovely and agile voice that handles the range and nuances of these Baroque arias with grace, and at times breathtaking, eloquence.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I love this movie...........good and wholesome for families............have watched it twice on the tv and finally made my mind up to buy it cause I liked it so much and that way I can share it with others.  Thank you.
B00A2FSSHK|5.0|One of the few scifi films where in almost all cases a decade down the road, the tech holds up. Very creative minds were clearly working on that aspect of this film.<br />The story itself remains compelling and entertaining. A great film noir from Spielberg and Cruise.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|its just fun and good times; when playing with friends. A number of people from work play together and enjoy t
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a very good read.  It was very imaginative and kept me on edge wanting to know what was going on.  I simply could not put it down until I had finished it.  I think it is way under priced.  I have read a lot of bad reads that cost 3 times as much! I'm interested to see where the series is going after this.  The characters were well developed and the book was edited Yea!!!  That is such a big deal on kindle to read a book that isn't full of grammatical problems..Thanks to the author for a great read!!!
B005LAIII0|1.0|We were anxious to see this movie after all the hype that surrounded it. After watching it, why all the hype? This movie does deliver a question about humanity but it was too slow in delivering that message. I actually was watching the clock hoping it would end soon. Had I watched it alone, I probably would have stopped watching. The visuals were nice, but as some have said there were some discrepancies in those visuals, the goat would not have gone thru the bars. The ads for the movie made it seem like a good movie for the whole family. I disagree. To explain why we didn't like the movie, I would have to give details and if you want to watch it, no need to spoil it. I would not recommend giving up 2 hours of your precious time to see this. That is time you will never get back.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game! I woul  recommend it to people of all ages. Great graphics ' make me very happy and entertained
B00CDCIQX6|1.0|I Rated this at one star because it never came up on my computer..So I never really saw this..And i wanted to see this really bad.....
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book has completely changed my view of and my approach to running. I never considered myself to be a &#34;runner,&#34; as I did it more for exercise, but now I run with a smile on my face and think of it as an integral and fulfilling part of my life.
0307720950|5.0|I am a fan<br />I am a huge fan of Chris Anderson. Both \\"The long tail\\" and \\"Free\\" are great reads and<br />Truly thought provoking. Both, but particularly \\"Free\\" is a book we use regularly with clients. The question asked is \\"what happens if your service will become available for free (which it will)?<br /><br />Talk about throwing a fox into a chicken den.<br /><br />Digital disruption<br />A few weeks ago we used \\"Digital disruption\\" as a way to explain to a client the speed of innovation. We are now talking overnight, Big Bang disruption, by Coder dojo trained entrepreneurs using free tools, utilising global platforms, using shared IP, open source and community principles as a key features to compete with the big boys (and winning). In \\"digital disruptions\\" there are a few references to the \\"making community\\" and how that will be the next wave of disruptions. \\"Making\\" as the new black.<br /><br />Makers<br />And presto, a few weeks later there is Chris Anderson with \\"Makers, the new industrial revolution\\". Another cracking book about how the same principals that transformed the ICT world is going to transform the manufacturing world.<br /><br />Must read<br />A book that should be read by any policy maker in the area of entrepreneurship, SME policy and economic development. Will be sending Richard Bruton a copy.<br /><br />Digitised DIY<br />Digitised DIY, where the need for economy of scale no longer applies, bottom up, highly networked, open source, with access to all the production tools you need with a single click of a mouse. Where the long tail of things creates millions of opportunities for small local businesses. The one-size fits all approach of the large manufactures no longer need to apply. You can make small batches at compettive prices. Scale is no longer an issue.<br /><br />Jump on the bandwagon<br />From an entrepreneurial perspective, the maker movement is where ICT was in 1985. You can already predict where this is going, apply the lessons and get on the bandwagon. But it also behest on the education system to jump on the same train and teach making. We need a 3D printer in every school.<br /><br />3D printing<br />Which brings us to printers. Remember the dot-matrix printer? That is where 3D printing is now. Now you have a small printer on your desk, printing HD colour pictures. That is where 3D printing is going. In materials, biology and DNA. For 99 Euro per printer.<br /><br />Killing giants<br />Open source hardware, with no patent protection, shared by a community of passionate, people. For the large manufacturers it is going to be very hard to beat that. Open source innovation is cheaper, faster, better researched and already has a head start in market research, marketing and support. With social capital and your eco system the new marketing tools. With word of mouth automatically build in. With a lot of emphasis on branding and trademarking.<br /><br />Loosing the talent war<br />And because it is driven by passion, it will attract the best talent from all over the world, working together. Try to beat that as a company. The long tail of talent and the need for a drastic relook on the way your organise your business. Which brings us to books such as \\"Loose\\" or \\"The connected company\\".<br /><br />No barriers to entry<br />So as a company you are now loosing on economy of scale, IP, marketing, talent and passion. Maybe finance as the last barrier to entry? Alas that is why they invented crowd funding. Which even reinforces all the above. The market research, the selling, the word of mouth, the social media, the story telling, the community, the speed to market, the channel, the distribution and the beginning of what Brian Solis calls the dynamic customer journey and constant feedback loop (from \\"What is the future of business\\" #WTF).<br /><br />Spot on<br />Chris Anderson has been spot on with his earlier books and I think he is spot on with \\"Makers\\". From a policy perspective, from an educational perspective and from a personal perspective. This movement can transform economies, people and allow you to finally follow your passion.rspective and from a personal perspective.

1451695195|3.0|Was not to thrilled with this book, I did not find it to be based up to the ratings I had seen.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great story.  It's an outside of the box tale that keeps you reading until the end.  Read this series before series before going after the Shift omnibus edition.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|6 year old grandson loves this game!! He couldn't be having more fun with it!!  Great for those rainy afternoons stuck inside !!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Fun concept and not too easy to play. Works great on the larger kindle fire hd. I only wish there was more stuff to buy (not real money) in game, even if it isn't anything that would help you.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I enjoy most of what Clancy writes.  Great book. Plenty of action.  I love the Campus idea.  Lots of killing but necessary to keep America safe.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Very fun, the large variety of puzzles is awesome. Time goes very fast while playing. You definitely have to be on your toes!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is a very fun game it could keep my 6yr old occupied for hours if i let him! great game!
0312330537|5.0|Once I started this book, I could not put it down, Good thing I had some spare time on my hands.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this is a great btd game for the kindle that allows you to pause unlike on the pc and gives you 2 new towers
B00C061I3K|5.0|What a great album! RAM is one of Daft Punks greatest album because not only do they show they are great musicians by using more live instruments than synths but they also show how they can take a dead genre of music and bring it back to life. Not as a good as Discovery but it's damn close.
B009X012XM|3.0|this is a nice slim case not bulky at all. i liked how the strap holds the cover in place. the only thing i did not like is it doesn't stay standing up when the cover is in the grove. when my kids used it it was not sturdy.
B00CRW2066|5.0|Listened to the album 3 times already, and I have yet to find a song that is \\"average.\\" It's refreshing to know there are still artists out there. DOWNLOAD THIS NOW!
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|I was looking for a diversion and found it.  I found the themes were overbearing and could have been handled in more subtle and sophisticated ways.  The lines were trite &#34;I had him on the ropes&#34; -- and repeated, in case you missed it the first few times.<br /><br />I believe that any material can be become a work of art in the right hands....this attempt, while fair, did not surpass the skill level of the typical high school &#34;artisan.&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|Kids knew about it better than I did and they asked me to get it for them. I can only say they have been very content since we got it. Thanks
B009KS4XRO|3.0|slow sometimes on the kindle but I love the game.  I would recommend it for anyone interested in playing bingo
B0063IH60K|3.0|I didn't understand how to play. I was not sure where to look for the directions.<br />I may try again
B00BPA2PBG|1.0|I was told by a reliable source that all this is, is a re-mastered re-released bluray from the original 35mm source just @ a slightly higher bit rate. the ONLY thing that you wil see different in this version vs the 1st bluray release is less grain and brighter colors. but its not an actual 4K copy. thanks again SONY for lying to your consumers.<br />I want to also point out that even tho this movie may have a higher bit rate than it's previous release @ around 35000mb's that on a true 4K release the bit rate would be at 100000 or greater.<br />HEVC x265 is the only way to achieve proper compression with a bit rate such as 35000 for 4K content.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My son asked for this and he seems to like it and plays it often. Great product for free. Thanks
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Wow it was awesome to me  and to you so much excitement there . Zack had lots of fun reading it
B00BEJ5O6Q|2.0|I have always enjoyed Blake Shelton's work.  He has a great voice and his choice of songs to sing have always been good.  I looked forward to this collection and was very disappointed as I started listening that there are curse words in the songs he chose.  I am NOT a prude I just don't cuss and don't listen to music with cussing in it. My grandkids love music and love to sing along.  I will not allow them to sing songs with curse words and then punish them when they say those same words they have learned outside the song.  Makes no sense.  I am truly disappointed as it is so unnecessary and I will not be spending any part of my \\"fixed income\\" on Blake in the future.  Sorry guy!
B0001I561E|5.0|fast shipping great quality, recived just as described, will do shopping with again. gotta have this movie if you are a kids movie fan
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a beautiful story that was delicately written and beautifully executed. Colleen Hoover is one of my favorite authors because her writing is pristine, fluid, and realistic. I'm so tired of reading books that are disorganized and use more words than necessary to make a point. This book creates so many emotional situations but has plenty of lighthearted humor to ease them. The characters were developed so well and work really well together, unlike other current books where the characters are entirely too frustrating to like. This book was excellent and I highly recommend it, as well as Hoover's other novels!
B009CF3P7E|5.0|A classic, JJ Abrams really has made the best Star Trek movies.  I was never a star trek fan until I watched this movie.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The mouse is simply amazing.  Not only does it feel extremely comfortable (I added all of the supplied weights), but the teflon surface glides easily without hesitation or sticking.  I love the fact that it lights up and that you can control the color of the flashing logo - or you can choose to keep it illuminated.  My only wish, albeit a nitpicky one, is that the illuminated logo was more uniform.  The center is very bright and distinct, however, the edges are noticeably darker.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I play this game on my kindle fire and I found this game to be an effective way to waste time. It is also highly addictive.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I love this novel so much and have read it multiple times. I love the premise, the relationships between family and friends, the conflict of emotions, and the ability to make decisions based on thoughts and feelings. It's so nice to read a novel about using a fine art to express yourself. I am aware there is as plethora of books dealing with music and rockers and bad boys and crap like that, but Hoover uses beautiful lyrics, poetry, and prose while creating a realistic situation. I love art and I think more authors should write about literature and poetry and expression of self. Beautifully written, Colleen!
0679805273|5.0|I received this book as a gift at my high school graduation and to the is day, it is one of my favorite gifts.  I purchased a copy for my daughter and will have her teachers and coaches sign it and surprise her with it at her graduation.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Great cinematography, excellent performances, and a compelling, true story -- all the ingredients of a very good movie. I really enjoyed it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this series--got it and within a week, had watched it over 6 times.  It is like a part of my childhood has come back to me--used to watch this with friends in high school...  If you like Austen, you'll love this series.  Best rendition of Pride and Prejudice I know of...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Definitely one of the best books I have read. Highly recommend it. If you are looking for a good military story or any story for that matter read this book.
B000IDEORY|5.0|The Chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, shows in this heartwarming movie. I have watched this movie many times over the years. Excellent Love Story!
B00BESM14U|4.0|This goes beyond the normal coming of age movie because it delves deeper into some serious issues.  The leads were outstanding, especially Emma Watson and the young male lead.  Well-worth watching.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Very gripping characters placed in a gripping storyline.  While the ending feels a touch rushed, you'll be hungering for more of the story. Not a bad thing at all...
B000YABYLA|5.0|Teenager Juno, far wiser than her years, is faced with an unexpected pregnancy, the result of a few moments of boredom with her boyfriend. Initially planning an abortion, she's repulsed by those involved and instead, with the help of her best friend, finds a suitable home for the unborn child - an affluent couple unable to have a child of their own. Things go south, however, with that family, and Juno is faced with some hard decision, while thankfully supported by her non-approving family.<br /><br />Juno's constant wise-cracking is what makes this movie work.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Amazing How much clarity is offered in this book :) get your 3Ps in focus with this book and live it without regrets!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Best book I have read !! Loved being in Drew' s head and it being from his POV...I hope there will be more books in this series!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had heard about this and wasn't sure what it was, but eventually decided to watch and got hooked<br />immediately.  In addition to your normal drama in a series, this gives a lot of insight into the history<br />and customs of the times; possibly similar to the early times at the Biltmore here in the US.  Very<br />enjoyable for me!
B00005NG9Z|4.0|I don't know too much of tunes' quality, but clips were visually impressive. Not a music for a good sleep even for listening CD.
B00795P4EG|2.0|On my initial try after watching the video...I found it hard to use.  I would like to find a more comprehensive  explanation... the videos were ok, but I am a reader.. I like to Read how to work things.<br /><br />I found it hard to use... and I've used cloning and other programs on my PC.. without trouble.  I am thinking if I were used with a stylus and not my finger... I might have better luck...<br /><br />It was only 99 cents/ coins... and well  maybe I will find a way to make it work.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Free? Are you serious?  I mean, what would you expect from a free calculator?<br /><br />Cuz this isn't it! Truly a gem of an app, a must (such an overused word, but here it applies) for any phone or tablet.  Try, you will love!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Just wanted more<br />It just felt like it was all being wrapped too quickly<br />Another book would have been good
B008N1V11U|5.0|Great game to play vary adickive as he'll MUST own MUST have MUST play GET it for yourself and save Gotham
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I love the idea of the expendables!  I love the idea of bringing back the action heroes of the eighties together in one movie. Chuck Norris as &#34;lone wolf&#34; was great.  Special effects were good too.  That said, it was too much gore for me (more of a 2000's movie than an 80's movie).  The movie had some cute one liners, but I guess I was expecting more humor, more &#34;inside&#34; jokes and more of a story line.  Morally the story was muddled with a bunch of guys running around shooting each other in cold blood.  This was not a good cops / bad cops movie or a classic war movie.  It was a movie about vengeance for the wrongful death of a mercenary with no moral restraints.
B00BLGZN1S|4.0|This was an interesting story with some good acting. The movie held you attention due to some good action scenes.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book had it all.  Being inside Drew's head was fantastic!  He was honest, adorable, loyal and sarcastic.  I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud reading a book.  Drew and Kate were a great pair.  Kate really challenged Drew and made him a better person.  It's definitely a must read.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is fantastic from the creepy music to the very last piece of the puzzle. I was very intrigued by the 3d graphics.I cannot wait for the next game. Please do not let us wait too long.
1451695195|5.0|I highly recommend this book to other readers. I found it fascinating and informative information about a little understood topic.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|seen many times but only on cable but great movie the actresses in this movie are nice looking and there could be a part 2
B002XMGGK6|3.0|This is a good film and quite true. However it made me very uneasy watching it. Would recommend it as a film to see for planning for some safety issues.
B00BESCJII|5.0|I expected to be disappointed since I read the book and the movie is never as good as the book.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I feel that the movie really captured the tone of the book. Also, Dylan McDermott can do no wrong in my eyes.
0810993139|5.0|Never read any of this series, but my 8 year old granddaughter has one of the books in this series.<br />Spent twoo weeks with her and finished one of the books. (she read it to me), so I decided to order a second<br />book before she finished it. These are fun books to read, and create a great dialogue over the story line.<br />We looked forward to seeing how our wimpy kid was going to mess up next.
B000XA5K48|5.0|great film the tittle saids it all shoot em up is right this guy even kills with a carrot great film just one dude against 100 other guys
B000FC1JAI|5.0|Not much time to note, but wanted to give something so others can see. Really enjoying this translation of Marky Mark, and having a lot of fun with the ideas. The intro is amazing, too.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I was hesitant to try this game but when I did it was GREAT just like Super Mario, of course hes a leprechaun. I love the fact that you get to shoot acorns! And the fact that there are alot of levels and many worlds. You also get 3 different slots so if one of your family members is barely going to try it, they can start from the beggining. My only issue when lep jumps it gliches and make  him come back diwn i have died soooo many times becayse of this please fix otherwise GREAT GAME!
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is a true masterpiece. There's so much heart &  soul in this record. I think the message the daft duo is trying to say with this album is that electronic dance music has started to become too disposable. I mean honestly how many songs can you remember from 2012 or 2011? Probably not many.  They wanted to switch the game up and get back to basics. This album is a disco/soul/rock journey. It sounds like the past,present, & future all in one. I always love it when artists dare to be different and theyve done it quite impressively. The production and song writing are off the charts on this one. Not a bad track on the album.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|great movie seen once before not yet arrive just ordered but seen allready so thought i'll write a reveiw now great film
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Couldn't be happier with the performance of this unit.  Incredibly easy to use and produces strong results without having to think to hard about settings.  I shoot with a Nikon D5000 and can't believe I waited 3 years to buy this flash.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely a couldn't-put-it-downer. Not wild about the ending, but I really couldn't come up with a ending that I feel would be better. Considering the two main characters, maybe that was the only way it could end. Good read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's definitely a good ending to the series. Halfway through the book is when it begins to get better and it only goes from there. A little sad about the ending and the deaths but all in all it was a good book.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I love playing on facebook. I keep intouch with my family through facebook. not having a computer really  sucks! but I can do almost everything on facebook with my kindle that I do with a computer. I love it!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent follow-up to first novel. Well developed characters with many twists and turns to keep you turning the pages. Looking forward to seeing how it ends.
B0067EKYS6|5.0|Previously Baz Luhrmann directed a version of Romeo and Juliet also starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and the visually spectacular Moulin Rouge. The Great Gatsby opened to a much higher than expected $51 million weekend.<br /><br />I was highly impressed with Baz Luhrman's direction. We don't see Gatsby for a while. We know him by how others react to him before we meet him, and DiCaprio does an amazing job of bestowing his own charisma on the character to create a certain aura of mystery. We get the sense that Gatsby is not quite on the level, yet he is a caring and considerate neighbor almost to a fault, old sport.<br /><br />Nick Carroway the narrator, and everyone's confidante, puts us firmly in the passenger seat to this adventure and lives next door to Gatsby's huge mansion where he throws lavish parties. Nobody knows how or where he got his money. As the movie progresses we learn why. Seemingly inconsequential events lead to unpredictable places.<br /><br />Essentially, it's a story about lavishly wealthy people, who sometimes lead careless, amoral and irresponsible lives.<br /><br />In the hands of Luhrmann for me at least this is a visually masterful movie, with some amazing shots. We have people dancing and swigging champagne in an open top car on the bridge into the city, and then the camera magically zooms away as the film speeds up. Was this shot from a helicopter flying at bridge level? There is a certain magical flow about how the movie unfolds visually, and moves between different visual images. I particularly liked how Gatsby in the flower scene imposes his greater reality on his neighbor's humble house, and how the woods add almost a surreal fairy tale element.<br /><br />It's almost as if Gatsby is godlike and creates the universe that surrounds him. Everything except free will. Gatsby has a moment of friction with Daisy, and at his party a glass breaks.<br /><br />Gatsby's place is like a Disneyland for adults. Set in the 1920s the movie boasts a fusion of musical sounds introducing a textured range of styles all the way to the current era, including some jazz and hiphop. I particularly loved a piece played on a giant Wurlitzer, and the scope of the movie is huge.<br /><br />We have beautiful cars including a yellow Duesenberg, plush almost ridiculously ostentatious Long Island mansions, impeccable costumes, and a wild unrestrained feeling. We have the rich and poor hobnobbing. We have parties. I sensed rather than knew this was a Luhrmann movie because it was somewhat visually reminiscent of the style of Moulin Rouge. This was not a bad thing. In fact, I wished that the musical aspect was played up at times, with more music or seeing a theater or performance of some kind within the scenes rather the performance being a backdrop to what was happening onscreen.<br /><br />And the character of Gatsby reveals first through a legend, based on image and respectability and being accepted by other rich people. Then we have the real story which for me was more impressive, and really encompasses the American dream. Perhaps that is why the story is so popular.<br /><br />Gatsby is special, and destined for greatness. He always knew this, and when he meets a certain someone it motivates him to achieve that greatness. But he did not seek this greatness only for himself. If there is shadiness involved, there is also a certain purity of heart, which sometimes skirts the edges of narcissism, and personal hubris. For nothing will dissuade him from his true purpose, and he wants an equally unbridled love in return. Does that sound unreasonable?<br /><br />I loved this movie. It's a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood formula. Usually one has to wait to year end for this type of quality entertainment so it's great to see such a movie in summer.<br /><br />After watching this I viewed the 1974 Gatsby starring Robert Redford, Mia Farrow, Sam Waterson and Lois Chiles.<br />The screenplay was written by Francis Ford Coppola. I found myself wishing that Coppola also directed that movie as it was somewhat slow in pacing, and the outstanding cinematography, a hallmark of Coppola's movies would have given it added visual splendor. I certainly recommend it for a viewing if only to compare and contrast. I loved some of the music and party scenes.<br /><br />It's clear that Luhrmann did use the 1974 movie as a template yet elevates this story and delivers a version that is superior in almost every respect, and the visuals especially were a feast for the senses. Some of the story elements are far clearer especially the denouement. Most importantly even though Gatsby was not perfect, Gatsby was great. And I feel privileged to have watched it. Apparently it got mixed reviews from critics. I say never mind the critics. Check it out for yourself.<br /><br />It looks better than the real twenties. I think most people will enjoy it and I hope this was helpful.ound myself wishing that Coppola also directed that movie as it was somewhat slow in pacing, and the outstanding cinematography, a hallmark of Coppola's movies would have given it added visual splendor.

B001HRJG2S|2.0|I remember buying this album when it came out on iTunes and being happy listening to it through my iPod earbuds. Years later, I've become an audiophile to a certain extent. I saw this album was available on vinyl for very cheap and ordered it, fondly remembering it. It's definitely not Fall Out Boy's best effort but I enjoyed it then.<br /><br />This morning before the package came I listened to about half the album in MP3 format thanks to AutoRip. It sounded good, and I wondered how much better it would be on a record. The mailman came, I ooed and awed over the red and orange clear vinyl. I removed the record I had been listening to before this ones arrival and began listening.<br /><br />Well, I was extremely underwhelmed. The sound quality is so bad on some songs that I felt the need to plug my headphones into my receiver to make sure it wasn't my speakers blowing out. Nope, just a poorly mastered record. Some songs are alright, maybe even pretty good, but the amount of compression and I guess clipping (I'm no recording engineer, I don't know) is so bad on some songs. It's almost unlistenable on &#34;West Coast Smoker&#34;. I did some Google searching to see if I was the only one with this problem, and I found a blogger complaining about the same thing.<br /><br />Audiophiles are probably not in the target market for this record though, so I'm not surprised they didn't try at all to make this album sound good on vinyl. It pains me to say this, but even the MP3 version sounds better. Buy that or the CD, and avoid the record.
B00969PR18|5.0|This is just what I wanted.  Works on my Kindle Fire when I don't have access to WIFI.  Maps for all U.S. states can be downloaded individually as needed
B009ANP4F4|5.0|This is really great.<br />The dancing, of course, is awesome!<br />But the storyline is great too and the acting<br />is really good.<br />Loved this!
0143119680|3.0|I've heard a lot of hype about this book and I was excited to finally read it. It starts out very well. I liked that Diana Bishop was a strong independent woman with a stellar academic career. Preferring to live her life without using her magic, Diana is confident that all her accomplishments have been achieved on her own. She's in Oxford doing research when she crosses paths with vampire Matthew Clairmont and that's when she starts to change. Her long repressed magic starts to show itself and not in a good way.<br /><br />This book meanders for 600 pages and that's the problem. It could easily be half that length and it would have been a page-turner. As it is, there are so many paragraphs devoted to her eating and drinking tea. I get it, she likes to eat and drink tea. I don't need to be told endless times. I was very disappointed to see Diana go from a strong independent woman to a weak-willed simpering witch who follows Matthew's every command. Beside that, my biggest complaint is that there is NO conclusion to any of the issues raised in the book. It ends on a cliff-hanger and if you want to know what happens next, you'll have to buy book 2. I understand ending books on a cliff hanger, but that's usually after the author has resolved some of the issues in the book. Ms. Harkness chose not to do that.<br /><br />I received this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review.
B00BDZV9M4|2.0|I Am Not a Human Being II isn't as good as Tha Carter IV. Lil Wayne dropped the ball on this one.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Tarantino is never shy about giving an audience the unexpected, so is the case with Django Unchained.  He loves presenting films with a &#34;B&#34; movie flavor but the execution and intellectual thought behind that execution goes far beyond wha's on the surface.  For example the hero of the film is a German dentist (Christoph Waltz - won an oscar by the way) who sacrifices himself because of his hatred of slavery.  In a town where German's aren't necessarily appraciated, Tarantino was making a risky statement.  Tarantino is both an entertaining and courageous film maker.  &#34;Django Unchained&#34; just extends his legend.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|Well, after reading the whole series, I was a bit disappointed. The book in itself is not that bad, the mystery in this case is a murder and I did not suspect the plot until explained later. Still, I think that Ms. Harris did not care about all the fans' expectations after so many books. I mean, people who like the books are people who like vampires after all, and this book is by far the one with less vampires. As I say, a disappointment. I think we deserved more after being faithful to the series...
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I love this app that works across all platforms & auto syncs ... it even allows me to share my notes & lists with my team.  We have an open line of communicating what needs to be done, ordered, taken care of - all in one neat application.  I removed about 10 pages of lists off my desk!!
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio is a great app for the Kindle fire. It let you listen to radio station around the world. i like it.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Fast moving and exciting. You will not fall asleep on this movie. Too, there are laughs aplenty. One of Tom's Best.  Enjoy
B0071XO8RA|1.0|The first book, or short story, was good.  Depressing, but good.  The rest of the Wool, Omnibus edition, is just depressing.  Depressing and boring, with a lot of commentary on stairs.  Lots of five star reviews suckered me into buying this book, but I can't force myself to finish it.  I kept hoping for some plot, or at least a hint on why I'm supposed to care about these idiot characters, but alas, it's just stairs.  My advice is save your money.
B005K17RU0|1.0|It was better before the upgrade. I am removing it. hard to see the info you need! I can't find the map!

B003X2O6KW|5.0|My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West is a good cd. One of his best cd he made. I like it.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|Yeah, Robocop 3 is ridiculously cheesy, but at least I've got the best quality version of it thanks to this set. And that's justified by getting Robocop 1 & 2 with it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Awesome 3D movie that looks even more awesome on my 55 inch 3d Tv. Do not hesitate to buy it if you love a great 3D movie.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I got this because my mother wonted to see it, she had it but her brother stole it from her and I got it and love it.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|21 Jump Street (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] is a very funny movie. The movie is funnier than what at first.
B00AO686MY|5.0|The film is an amazing achievement in a pre-CGI world. Wish the blu-ray came with a nice slip-cover like the DVD edition does.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|I chose this movie to watch one of my favorite Korean actors cross over.  I found myself enjoying it even though the bloddy types of movies are not usually my taste.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My ant had this move and lost it in her storig and I spoted it here so I got it and love it
B001794FOK|5.0|Jumper (Special Edition + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray] is a hot and great movie. They should make a part 2....i'm just saying
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Just as the title says this is a fun game while you get to use your imagination<br />Is great for children and adults
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Always a wonderful read. I never get tired of this book. I love all the Oz tales.  Brings back pleasant memories of childhood reading.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I liked the cast ant the scenes but the overall movie was a little drawn out and at times confusing.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Great on loud but not soo suround sound on low , fits good never used mic.  But this bit be do to audio settining  with sound card
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Storyline was excellent. Audio was divine, kept looking over my shoulder with the 7.1.great balance! Video was great as well. but this is Quentin so we knew that would happen!<br />.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much I wish they would put the  update on you should get it . It is so awesome I spend mostly every day on it I love it
B009RH9FR6|5.0|In short, it is very good and one would like it.  The quality, finishing are excellent.  Absolutely no regret for purchasing it.

B008B68IEA|5.0|I got my daughter this bed and the Abbey Bominable doll!  They are perfect together.  She loves them and plays with them all the time!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE,THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A BUM MOVIE WITH A TITLE LIKE THAT. BUT WAS DEFINETLY A SHOCKER
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Love the downloader on my computer and tried to get a similar one but to no avail.  It works okay but not the best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well it is what it says it is. The first book is fantastic. Great characters, interesting plot, lots of unexplained backstory for the imagination. I read it almost instantly I was so hooked. It's also probably one of the better book to movie adaptations. Obviously there are changes and it's missing/has new stuff, but overall it's WAYYYY more accurate than of the Tolkien or Harry Potter movies.<br /><br />It's not the perfect book, but it's a great read. I'm reading the second now and I'm a little worried about the lovestory taking over the good parts. So at this point, the biggest advantage the first book has is it focuses on the plot we were told about. Which was a great plot. I'm not big into the romance aspect of teen novels, and a love story is always welcomed, but this is getting kinda cheesy. In any case, the first book is great, but it seems a bit...unique, compared to the other books in the trilogy.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|This album is by far the best one yet.  They expand and grow with each album.  It is one of those albums where every song is exceptional.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This &#34;hidden object&#34; game keeps me somewhat entertained while I'm waiting for my favorite game to put up another level.  There is too much to do here and keep track of.  Plus you have an &#34;energy&#34; limit.  Won't purchase more energy so I have to wait a period of time to get my &#34;energy&#34; back to continue.
B000I8JEY2|4.0|Funny and entertaining. Get the popcorn ready. Kept my interest through out the 2 hours. I might watch it again!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Great game, interesting premise and Destroying the world by overrunning it with zombies is an amazing cerebral (brains!) challenge and always fun.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|Everyone has a different opinion, but this just did not suite my needs for my Kindle Fire.  Not worth it...
B004WJRTXG|4.0|Love this.  It is the first Jonathon Tropper novel I've read and I loved it.  Easy read, plenty of laughs and he certainly has the ability to liken moments to your own life.  Very enjoyable.
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|I can appreciate the hard work that's gone to create this game and sure looks nice but come on guys this is a phone screen, at best 5 inches. No one is going to spend that much time learning and operating this.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of Birmingham, UK and this is a great app to keep me up to date on what is going on there.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I didn't know what to expect with this movie. It wasn't a bad movie but it was interesting to see how looking at things from a different perspective gives you a different motivation to either prosecute or defend.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|I am a diehard Rod fan. I waited for this to be released with excitement...even bought his autobiography.  Maybe one or two of these songs really felt like a good old Rod song. In his biography he mentioned he thought he had at least one more album left in him. I hope this isn't the last one...it's not one that I'd want to be the capstone for his career. I still love Rod, though...I'll just listen to his other songs.
B00156VGX8|5.0|WARNING:  NOT FOR THE FEINT OF HEART!!!  Watched this movie for an independent movie paper for a film class and fell in love with director Gaspar Noe.  This movie is really good...if you watch with an open-mind.
B0011Z7JO8|5.0|Easily the band masterpiece...Even excels over their Hotel  California...Grand mixture of soulful  ballads and strident rock...Theme rock at a sublime level.
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Was in hd, picture was great but movie stopped twice to buffer. Besides that cost to rent was fair but thought it would be free with prime membership.
B0086700CM|5.0|Got the version on my iPhone first and was addicted!  Then I got the Kindle Fire version and I like it better...although it is a bit more &#34;sensitive&#34; to movement.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|While driving I asked my kid to do some math on the calculator on his kindle.  The calculator would not work without wifi.<br />Not worth having on the kindle.

B0018STVHQ|5.0|I love Phillipa Gregory's books and I love old England royalty.  This put the 2 together for a great movie!  Plus Eric Bana is great eye candy...as is Scarlet Johannsen.
0425166805|4.0|The ideas and concepts are fascinating, I watched the movie years ago and wanted to read more detail, but was disappointed in the text and writing style.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|Really good cd probably one of beyonce best she always com out with very nice songs and different than her ones before.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I had to find a program that allowed me to do something...I can't remember what now (Maybe I should've done this review earlier) but I deleted it because it didn't do what it said it was going to do...
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Excellent music! Love the lyrics and blues. Love her voice! The band really works well together. Saw them on SNL and immediately started searching for their music.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|this game is fun until it freezes or kicks you out. credits get used up very quickly and if you want to continue playing you have to purchase more. not worth it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I prefer Google over any other search engine.  This app is easy as the one you'd have on your phone!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Want something to read that comes raw and unfiltered by the publishing machine? Check out WOOL, a wonderful post-apocalyptic story of discovery, need and the core of human emotion.
B008B11RLQ|4.0|Of the 95 some odd albums Elvis produced during his lifetime, this set includes 20 originals. Nice! Perhaps ya'all wanna buy a copy of your own? (Not from me, Im keeping mine!) Thank you very much! Elvis has left the building!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I am a huge fan of the finding nemo movie and this game is just good fun for all ages!!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I loved the movie!!!  Being a big Star Trek fan from way back you think it can never get better!!!  But it did.  The excitement kept me glued to my computer the whole time and that is comming from a person whose attention is hard to get.
B002RRWWQ4|5.0|We all loved this movie!  As always, great effects, great story and acting!  Harry Potter never disappoints!  I would highly recommend this movie!
B00CS65JS2|1.0|About 2 months ago, I was looking at the top albums sold on iTunes (I do this in search for new music), and noticed that all of the old Daft Punk albums were suddenly listed in the top 10 selling albums for dance and electronic. My initial thought of why this was happening was that \\"Daft Punk has a new album coming out!\\" and upon further research, I was right! For 2 months I have been waiting for this album to drop, because I was in dire need of some new electronic music. And who better to drop a new album... than Daft Punk... that brought you all the edgy classics that everyone knows like Around the world, Da Funk, One More Time, Face to Face, Technologic, Robot Rock, Harder Better Faster Stronger, and my personal favorite - Revolution 909. Just even thinking of all of these amazing songs while writing the previous sentence brings break great memories.<br /><br />5/21/13. Went straight to Amazon. Bought the album. Play.<br /><br />Listened to the first few songs, kinda funky, I can dig it for now, maybe the next song will have more energy to it, that kind of Daft Punk sound that I am used to, like most of the songs listed above.<br /><br />6 more songs go by, and still the same funky, disco'ish semi-slow sound. Now I am thinking to myself \\"What the hell is going on. Usually there is a more upbeat sounding song by track 8 or 9. SURELY, the whole album cannot sound like this? Maybe they are ascending the energy in the songs from 1 to 13, i.e. maybe the last few songs will have the most upbeat vibe to it.\\" I continue to listen in anticipation.<br /><br />Next few songs play, and its the same damn thing.<br /><br />While in the middle of the very last song, I notice some electronic saw-synth transitions beginning to happen. My smile grows as this is the type of sound that I have been waiting for the whole album! But I second guess myself into disappointment, as I know this is the last song! But then I second guess myself again, thinking.. \\"maybe the made the last songextremely long, and this is going to turn into a really awesome 7 - 12 minute minute song!\\" This noise... the FM Synth Leads... the electronic Moog riffs... the chills from strategic placed electronic notes that latched into your ears for days... the pattern of rising intense robotic sounds that usually intros a magically crafted track... lasted for about 10 more seconds, and the f****** album ended.<br /><br />*Pause for 5 seconds*<br /><br />\\"WHAT THE F***!\\"<br /><br />Not 1 song in this album resembled that upbeat sound I was craving for. NOT ONE. In my Daft Punk music, I need that House Roots, four on the floor beats, that simple kick and snare melody to carry me along excited synthesizers. I need that trendsetter noise that Daft Punk always brought to the table when releasing a new album. Sure, in the past albums, there has always been the 4 or 5 slower songs to give the album a variety... but to make the entire album this way!!? Wow... I am disappointed. I understand that sometimes artist take different approaches with new albums, just to keep the content fresh while experimenting with new sounds. But DAFT PUNK... COME ON. We need that upbeat techno sound that was found in all previous albums. If your technique has worked the same in all previous albums, why change? It goes along with the old saying of \\"If it aint broke, dont fix it.\\" I can hear the other side of this conversation, with people saying \\"their technique has always been to come up with a new and unique sound, and they definitely hit the mark with this album.\\" With Music and most things in life, I believe its about finding a Middle Ground... Finding the sweet spot that is not skewed too far one direction. All of the previous albums had this sweet spot! But this album... just sounds too far away from the original recipe that I am used to.

1451668945|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark, the mistress of suspense, offers a multi-layered, highly suspenseful mystery in DADDY'S GONE A HUNTING. The story begins on November 14th at 4am, when Gus Schmidt is getting ready to meet Kate Connelly at her father's furniture and antique museum factory. Gus was forced into retirement and carries a big grudge. Why is Kate so eager to meet him at this hour of the morning in the Long Island City facility? As the two make their way into the dark factory, it suddenly blows up, killing Gus and putting Kate in a coma.<br /><br />Kate is a CPA for one of the largest financial corporations in the country. Who would possibly want to hurt her or Gus? For that matter, who would want to destroy the famous factory and museum that was full of priceless antiques? In addition to the factory, several million dollars was tied up in the land upon which the facility stands. Doug Connelly, the girls' father, was losing money and trying to sell the land --- but was not happy with the deals he was offered. So he kept waiting for a better bid. At first, he didn't care about the explosion because he thought he would collect the insurance money. But when the fire marshal determined that arson was the reason for the explosion, no insurance company would pay.<br /><br />Kate's sister, Hannah, is a clothing designer who has just been given the honor of getting her own label. But the fact that Kate is in a coma and her father is acting strangely interfere with Hannah's work and life. She spends hours at the hospital by Kate's bedside trying to talk to her sister, believing that Kate can hear her even if she cannot respond.<br /><br />In the meantime, other characters make important appearances that keep the story racing at breakneck speed. A homeless man is found to have been living in a junked van on the premises and is thought to be the one who set the fire. In addition, a picture of a family is recovered among the junk he has collected over the years. Who is this man? What is his place in the suspenseful plot? Does he have anything to do with a few young girls who have disappeared without a trace over the years?<br /><br />Mary Higgins Clark has penned yet another mystery that will keep her at the top of the suspense writers list for a very long time. As the narrative unfolds and more questions than answers arise, the \\"players\\" take center stage, and readers will find themselves catching the layers of clues left for them. Slowly, secrets decades old eke into the filament of the story. More than one family is involved, and more than one family member plays a bad but pertinent role in the narrative. Past and present merge in a mélange of kaleidoscopic confusion as the characters begin to believe that they are being investigated by the police and fire marshals.<br /><br />DADDY'S GONE A HUNTING will chill readers as secrets are revealed, and people's masks are torn off. This one is not to be missed.<br /><br />Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a fairly good white noise machine; much better than physical ones I've purchased before to help my wife/kids sleep.  Sometimes you just want ambient noise without music.  I can't often tell when the sounds repeat in their cycle, unlike other white noise systems.  Great app.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Fast paced, great action.  If you're a fan of these types of movies you'll love it. Fun for everyone in the family
B007N6NGYG|3.0|I downloaded this for my son who really likes trains.  He is 4 and loved watching it but definitely could not play the levels as they got harder.  Works OK when we play together and crash and/or resuce the trains.
B008XG1X18|3.0|it used to work awesome for my kindle fire; now it wont load and i would like it fixed!!!! i cant use it if it wont load!!
B004UHL9EK|4.0|My Android phone used to have a timer built into my clock before the most recent update.  This is a very handy tool with increased functionality.  I'm glad it was available one day as a free download or I might have passed it by without trying it.
B00C061I3K|4.0|so i really dig the downbeat sound that this daft punk album has.  the first two tracks had me amazed as i drove home from the store with it playing in the car.  to me this seems much more of a \\"car\\" album than a dance floor record.  it has bass galore, and poppy vocal overdubs that get me where im going in the car without feeling like traffic sucks.<br /><br />overall i give it a 4, im glad i got the cd instead of the vinyl.  there are tracks i skip, and there are tracks i want to skip right to.  id say 5 very good songs i play out of the album.  plus i love the 12th track.  straight bass.  i hope your crossover is tuned just right as this baby slams.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|My kids and I played this game a bit.  It was interesting for awhile but we lost interest quickly.  Funny concept though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was trepidatious  when I started this series -- an unknown author is always a risk. But the hook was good, so I expended the six dollars and got the whole silo series.<br /><br />Worth it.<br /><br />I lost so much sleep reading these books I should be ashamed of myself. But the story, the characters, and the writing was above par. The whole world he creates just snags you in and doesn't let go. He accomplishes one of the hardest things to do successfully in fiction -- character development. You wind up caring about what happens, and it keeps you reading.<br /><br />Howey has managed to create a world with endless opportunities both for himself and other aspiring writers. I anticipate many more sleepless nights with each new iteration.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is good. The items are a decent mix of difficulty. The storyline is a little convoluted and the energy rejuvenation takes WAY too long. I can only play once a day, which is a bummer.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I find this book still very helpful. It's been written a while ago but still is of use to people of today.
1419707299|5.0|Very humorous! My 9 yr old could not put it down before completing it. One of the most interesting in this series.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I thought this was a great movie to watch with family especially your mother! I saw a couple parallels with my own!<br />I thought the movie was comical, but it could have been funnier in my opinion. It was also short, (it had a run time of only 1:30). Overall I thought it was a nice movie. Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen were a good pair!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Such an addicting show! I've rewatched season 1 so many times now. Can't wait for season 2 to come out!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|If you did not play this game, especially if you did not play any XYZ dash game yet, you must play it.<br />Only the minus one star is because this game is also another &#34;dash&#34; games, but it is still worth to play it
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|what can you say when you finally find a game worth playing.  5 stars all the way. cannot wait to try more of their games
B000002NHN|5.0|I enjoy the songs in my hifi system and its quality is good. At the beginning, about seven years ago, I nearly heard them everyday in my ipod classic.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show inspires me and has made me a better person. Ill be crushed if its ever taken off air.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would highly recormend this game for all ages. This game is simalar to Temple Run.This is a great game.You should get this for your kid today. They will love it!<br /><br />  :)  ;)
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This series needs to outlast \\"friends\\". It's motivation much needed to succeed in the private sector world of business. I will be crushed if its ever taken off air.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|hey mom this game has got no 1 star yet so I'm being a jerk and giving it HORRIBLE review and I have not played this game yet so yeyuh
030746363X|4.0|Interesting book I truly don't know if it will work for everyone. Giving up fruits except  tomatoes, avocados and grapefruit  juice is hard, on top of grains and bread.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|User friendly with intuitive search functionality. Easy to use, fast, simple with numerous options for versions. Highly recommend this excellent app.
B002XZOZQA|1.0|While we were watching this, it stalled out. The screen told us it was loading but it never did. Our Roku works fine, so that is not the problem.<br /><br />I am requesting a refund.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />RCH
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Inspiring on several levels, great script, excellent acting, produced beautifully. A story of a great horse, a wise and loving father who inspired the greatness in his daughter, and a courageous and knowledgeable woman. Her courage, confidence, and determination reminded me of my grandmother. Good reminder that women can change the world too!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was great for anyone that has enjoyed video games, movies or music for the last 30 years, aka everyone.  After seeing this in my recommended folder for so long, I decided to finally give it a shot.  Could not have been more happy that I did.<br /><br />As a disclaimer, I grew up in the Eighties like certain characters in the book, so most of the references felt like a happy home coming.  The author did a wonderful job of immersing you into the world where Blade Runner meets the Matrix; the real and virtual worlds blending together beautifully.  If you even remotely enjoy SciFi genre of movies or TV, this is a must read.<br /><br />This book pulls you into the world and it's hard to put down as the characters grow and evolve.  The main character was well developed, though I would enjoy learning more about the secondary characters as well.  The story is all from the perspective of Wade, so I understand why their stories were only put together at the end, but really would have liked more.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I kept on thinking that this would translate wonderfully to a movie, much like he commented on in the notes at the end, though it would be a licensing nightmare. (Yeah, I actually want to know who and what influenced the author and figure they deserve their 10 seconds of being acknowledged).<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Very well produced, excellent and relevant script in this above standard Christian film. Too many Christian films are poorly done and this one was very professional with excellent character portrayals. Especially pleasing was the Biblical principals that were accurately portrayed and the challenge to step up to family leadership. It is so refreshing to see something that is not making Christians, families, or men in general look like a bunch of idiots. We need more films with this kind of quality.<br />My thanks to everyone who made it possible.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Richard is amazing! This series is great so far. I can't believe there are so many books to it I will have to make time to catch up. I don't want to miss out. There is some serious imagination going on it blows my mind everything is to my liking well except those ladies in the forest but other than that some great battle is going on.
B00BQH9UL6|5.0|I really enjoy all of their music and this cd is no exception.  They have a very distinct sound all their own and they really stay true to their music. There are many great tracks on this cd and it arrived on time and packaged perfect.
B005WLQQ4Q|4.0|My daughter loves big time rush. I got her this cd and she sings along to it all the time. I recommend this to any BTR fan these boys can sing :)
B004G600A4|5.0|got this movie for my niece's 3rd birthday and she loves it!!<br />If you are a disney move fan, you must get this movie.  Very delightful!!
B009LY72LQ|4.0|My daughter loves monster high. She can not connect all the body pieces together so it's mommy and daughter teamwork time when we buy the create-a-monster packs. This pack only came with one wig which was a real bummer. How much more would it really be both in time and cost if they just added the other wig. What girl wants her doll hairless? We ended up buying one. She plays with them and they fit right in with her monster family. the clothes can fit the other girls and the bodies never fall apart I recommend this item to any mh fan
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I love the rollercoaster that this book took me on. There are parts of the book where I literally held my breathe in anticipation of what was coming next
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|My daughter loves the show, James and all the songs. She was so happy to get this cd, she sings to it all the time. I know she would recommend this to any big time rush fan.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was great it had lots of funny pics and really really funny speach bubbles. I think that anybody who wants to read this book should!!!!!!!
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist was a fast moving novel and an inspiring and interesting one at that. It was about a little boy named Santiago who wanted to be a shepherd and left his family to pursue his dream with a herd of sheep. He traveled the desert and met many people along the way. During his journey he finds out what a personal legend is. He then begins to feel like he can pursue his dreams without feeling uncomfortable. Santiago's story was really inspiring and I hope to find my personal legend some day, too.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|Sure this is predictable, American TV but the spin-off from JAG and NCIS is good clean fun and the characters are a blast. Stoked I can have these on my Prime and watch it all summer until the next season starts!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Really fine app.  Comes in handy when we are RVing.  Nice to know what is down the road or what is following you.
B000JMKRKC|1.0|After reading the summary on Amazon, I thought the book sounded very interesting.  This book ended up being *very* boring.  The descriptions of every. single. detail. were unnecessary and really ruined the plot.  In fact, I abandoned the book after about 50+ pages.  The plot never really got off the ground in time to hold my attention.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|love this tool set, has all the tools needed to take apart your macbook, fix your iphone and iPad.  i think it is a bit over priced.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loooooved this book, and I am very picky.  5 stars is rare for me, but this book was wonderful.  The mystery was very original, and the book kept me guessing until the very end.  Alternating points of view between not only the main characters, but also between the past and present worked effectively.  Definitely read this one!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am hooked. I have finished all the puzzles and have downloaded this game on every device in my house. I am waiting for updates so I can have more puzzles. Its bad when you uninstall the game just to reinstall so you can do the puzzles again. So that leads back to the whole I need more puzzles. I believe I am on the fourth time of dong all the puzzles again.
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|I know what they were trying to do with this soundtrack-hip hop today is kind of like jazz in the 1920's. Both were looked down upon by adults (they thought it was a bad influence on the younger generation, etc.) But if I want to listen to Jay Z then I can buy his albums. I love the book and I didn't like the 1970's version of this movie so I thought I might enjoy the 2013's. I do like this movie but it would have been sooooo much better if they actually had jazz music in it and didn't depend on so much CG effects. It's bad enough I have to hear a hip-hop song every time they go to the next scene and hear \\"Young and Beautiful\\" until my ears bleed.<br /> The only thing I liked about this cd is Florence
B0094M2S5A|5.0|'The Big Chill&#34; Stands the test of time--always great!  I love seeing all these cast members<br />in the prime of their careers.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|This book paints quite a picture of life in Bombay and Mr Roberts has a way with words ~a little to much graphic violence for me. I could not help but wonder how many hits on the head a person can take without sustaining traumatic brain injury. He must have the hardest head in the world. It would make a good movie.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|This 25th year performance is quite good with several of the vocalists being excellent.  The video quality is good as one would expect from a DVD.  The performance is not quite up to the level of the 10th anniversity performance but still very good.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I am a bit embarrassed to say this, but this was my first time ever watching Monsters Inc all the way through. It is a wonderful movie. Great job by all the cast members. The story line is consistent and does not miss a beat. Monsters Inc is: funny, touching, memorable, and just plain fun. I enjoyed all the characters really well; although Mike Wazowski was my favorite. It is movies like Monsters Inc that will never get old or boring and will always have sentimental (irreplaceable) value for a long time. Fantastic movie once again by Pixar and no one is more ready than I am  for Monsters University.<br /><br />5 Stars
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book was great and I laughed a bunch! Also my son's loved it. Overall I think this was a very great book!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like twitter.. I was just lookin for something a little different.. might download again is tweetcaster keeps acting up..
B007SGM084|5.0|Although, a little racy, this is a very entertaining read, and definitely would recommend only to those eighteen and older.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|The movie had some great moments in it. It lagged in a few parts and some of the jokes were lacking but over all it was good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had to get caught up before I watched the next episode, and this was a great option to watch.
B00402FGE4|2.0|It did not compare to the other Stsrgate's.  It was a complete Turn Off for me.  It was to sporatict with what should have been a good story.  It did not work for me after seeing the othere Stargates.  It was really a boring show.  The story was ruined it did not follow and was a Turn Off.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|This was a boredom purchase, and enjoyed it very much. It is the game and mixed up in different shapes and scenes.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|Answered a number of questions from the earlier movies and it was very interesting to see how it all began. Well worth the time to watch!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I had to catch up on some episodes that I missed and this was a great choice. Great, clear picture.
0061353248|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand why we do some of the perfectly. Irrational things we do. Ad to tose who want to persuade people to do perfectly irrational things.
1932100660|5.0|I have adjusted my dietary habits, as has my wife, after reading this book.  The contents are so rich in detail and backup it is hard to imagine the book has not received wider publicity.  A must read for anyone interested in being healthy all the way to the end of life.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|Thirty Seconds to Mars new album Love, Lust, Faith, & Dreams is so breathtaking. I don't know how they do it, but each album just gets better and better. This new one is so provoking both emotionally and spiritually.  The tunes that stand out the most to me is The Race (made me cry on first listen), Do or Die, Northern Lights, Birth, and of course the first single Up in the Air. Please everyone get your hands on this music!!!!<br /><br />Not many albums make me think about the direction of my life and how I'm affecting the world and my soul, but this one does. It's a holy affair.<br /><br />Also, I really appreciate the intimate interaction this band has with their fans. Proud to call myself an Echelon!
B0095P33IW|4.0|The story is corny and the acting is bad, but the movie is exciting and the action is very entertaining.
B00CW665VI|5.0|6 squee-inducing stars!!<br /><br />Honestly, if I attempt to write a lengthy review right now, i will flail all over myself in fangirl glee and probably make absolutely NO sense. So, i will keep this short and sweet.<br /><br />I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK. Every word. Every page. Every egotistical boast that came out of Drew's impossibly pompous-sounding ass. Every last bit of it.<br /><br />I have always loved reading a romance from the male POV, but I have to say when I started this book and started to see what an arrogant jerk Drew starts out as, I had my doubts that I would ever be able to fully warm up to his character.<br /><br />Silly, silly girl.<br /><br />Emma Chase somehow managed to take a character that is so inherently unlikable in the beginning, and transform him into someone you not only end up rooting for, but someone that you completely and unabashedly fall head over heels in love with.<br /><br />I loved the way the author chose to tell the story in such a conversational way. Like Drew is sitting with a friend and explaining how he went from being a shameless manwhore, to being happily wrapped around the finger of his dream-woman. It felt so natural, and flowed so well that it made it next to impossible to stop reading this book once I started it. And not to mention that it seemed like every other thing Drew said had me laughing like a crazy person off their meds. I mean, my poor Kindle needs a rest after all the highlighting I did. I could have seriously highlighted 90% of the book. It was that darn good.<br /><br />This book was SUCH a wonderful breath of fresh air and I can't express how much I enjoyed getting a peek inside Drew's twisted, perverted, & immensely entertaining mind!
B00881VLCE|3.0|this is the best app in the world in my opinion<br />but everytime I leave the game with my puzzle incompleate the next Time I open the app it crashes I hate this please fix and I will give a 5 star
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works well on the Fire 2.  Wish I did not have to unlock it to acknowledge the alarm but that still does not keep me from giving 5. stars.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I Loved this as a kid and still love it.  Sent a copy to my nephew and one for my kids.
B00C061I3K|3.0|This is a homage to the music that they loved growing up from the 70s and 80s, made clearly for themselves. Which fans are more than welcome to enjoy, but its not even in the slightest made with them in mind. An endeavour from secretive childlike eccentrics, which is perfectly fine. As a lot of great stuff comes from people like that.<br /><br />But they knew what this album would be and it would have been nice if they were honest about. Instead of their passive aggressive \\"wink, wink its gonna suck\\". It would have made more sense if this was labeled as an off shoot like their movie or Tron Legacy. Tron has elements of Daft Punk, but its not Daft Punk. This has elements of Daft Punk, but its not Daft Punk. Or at least not what WE want and/or thought of Daft Punk to be.<br /><br />Perhaps the goal is to distance themselves as far away from Discovery as possible. Its not what they are or enjoy to be anymore, so we should think of them as Random Access Creation Generators. In the past an awesome electronic album, today a movie or disco record, tomorrow an ice sculpture or a stage show.<br /><br />I'm giving it *** stars, even though its more like **1/2. For what it is, it's a descent disco/pop/80s mix. Yet even then it kind of lacks the emotion and enthusiasm those genres usually have and is a little stiff.
B002YRZ1VA|4.0|Chaka Khan was always fun to listen to. This music takes me back to younger years and blasting the songs on my radio! Fun party CD!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game. it is so much more exciting than the first one. and the graphics are much better.
B0011Z77OK|4.0|I love the sound of the Chili Peppers! Flea puts such a great bass beat to the songs! Fun music to crank up!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Being a Pink Floyd fan as I am this concert is the culmination of the works of Mr. David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason, Guy Pratt, and others. PULSE Live absolutely sets the bar for all other concerts to be judged. In Sorrow and Comfortably Numb you will see the master at work having a powerful conversation with his instrument, and in Wish You Were Here, the master will delight you with his melodic prose.<br /><br />There is none other that compares to this masterpiece although many have tried in vain. This is akin to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony embodied in the concert for the ages. I have said many times in my life that only the true masters of their respective craft stand alone and deliver a performance for the ages and in PULSE Live this is especially true. It is too bad that Amazon will only allow five stars for this masterful performance, I would give it ten stars plus for what the masters have delivered to us earthlings. Durga, Sam, and Claudia are indeed the mistresses of the night and give PULSE Live its melodic and feminine soul, Jon and Richards keyboard prowess are indeed masterful in its own right. Well I could go on and on about PULSE Live but I'll allow history be the judge. Buy this for your collection you will not be sorry, it is a timeless masterpiece for the ages.<br /><br />Masterfully and Respectfully Submitted<br /> Erica Baker
B0011Z31V8|5.0|All of us probably have memories with Prince songs in the background. This is a great compilation of hits! Get up and dance! Crank it up!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I was so satisfied with the build and features of the little Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer I purchased from Amazon a couple of months ago that I am upgrading to the Behringer 802. I use  the 502 in my dance instruction class to mix my wireless voice and Bluetooth music inputs to the facility sound system.  It has worked flawlessly and several students have commented on the quality of the mixer.  It is one rugged little unit and now I am looking forward to the added channels of the 802 for more music input options.  As to the 502, it will go back in the box and wait for future use, perhaps on my home entertainment system.  These are solid value well-built mixers.  As an FYI, I am using the Miccus Home RTX: Long Range, Bluetooth Music Transmitter or Receiver (A2DP) for music input to the mixer from an iPhone.  It is a great combination of technology for teaching dance classes.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|What an amazing band! What amazing sound!  All three are great artists!  This is definitely a must have! You'll enjoy every track!
B00A50PE6K|4.0|I am enjoying this CD.  The music is very pleasant and I enjoy it while driving or doing paperwork.  Goodbye.
B00BN2CY7G|5.0|What a fantastic new CD from Bon Jovi! They've been making music for decades and never get old! This has been played and played since I downloaded it! A must buy!

B001BIMYXQ|5.0|What a great collection! I love Annie Lenox's voice! This is a crank up and sing along CD for sure! The 80s turned out such good music! This is a must for your collection!
B00A3ATW4M|4.0|I am enjoying this CD.  The music is very pleasant and I enjoy it while driving or doing paperwork.  Goodbye.
B00C7JCDO8|5.0|I've loved David Coverdale and the boys for years! This live CD is awesome!  Great sound! Great music! Awesome band! The vocals are good for being live too!
B00371XIJE|5.0|The best!  Having watched this movie, I would definitely buy an Akita. The dog was amazing and so was Richard Gere!
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I've always loved Enya's sound. Great music to play while relaxing, reading or studying. A definite must have in your collection!
B00992CF6W|5.0|hi guys today I will build a house.I will need a lot of blocks I will make pool next to my house
B003ELKNH2|5.0|when I ordered this movie for school, I just barely ordered it in time according to the estimated delivery date. however, when I noticed that I get it two day early I was thrilled.
B005O65Y3S|3.0|I am not using the top part, since I use the X10/20 Lens Hood most of the time. Quality good. Fit OK. pain to remove to access battery compartment 2 times a day on a walkabout.
B00AEFYS8G|5.0|when I ordered this movie for school, I just barely ordered it in time according to the estimated delivery date. however, when I noticed that I get it two day early I was thrilled.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as good as the first two books where I could not put down. Seemed like the plot struggled in the beginning.
B00AEFYK5M|5.0|Oldest brother, 14 years older than me, took me to see this with his new girlfriend.  They would be married later on.  He was so good at waiting a while after the movie ended to let me stop my crying.  This will always be a favorite of mine.  I remember all the jewelry boxes sold played the theme song.  Who can forget &#34;Love means never having to say your sorry&#34;?  Aw, nostalgia!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Since A Game Of Thrones has more than enough reviews about the actual story, I wanted to take this moment to point out that I had absolutely no issues with the kindle edition. Another reviewer had gone on and on about how bad it was, and despite my concerns I purchased it anyway.<br /><br />Long story short, the book is awesome and the kindle edition is fine. If the e-book is your preference, buy it with confidence.
B004U7MQYC|5.0|Great story for those not only familiar with the television series but for the movie audience as well. Special effects very good for the year developed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is super addictive and fun. I recommend it for all people who have time to kill. Super fun and simple.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft minecraft pe is a big step into portable gameing this game is fun so much fun i love the game i can't wait for the nexy update. This game is recommended for people that love to built and have a creative mind and thats me i give this game a 5 stars out of 5. Keep up the good work. And fill the world with joy in creative gameing.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I am desperately waiting for the release of Boardwalk Empire Season 3. Steve Buscemi is awesome in this as well as the other actors. Great storyline.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|Having fun with this game  Plays just like the real casino  Not winning much but not unusual  You'll enjoy it
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|Disappointing ending to a good season. Made me want to not watch the series any more. Save your money and watch something else.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I guess I'm just over AB. I like the original ones better and hate the Bad Piggies. Do some stretches instead.
B0021XUHT8|3.0|It was a strange movie. It was, a little hard to follow. It sure was different, that's for sure. Times were good and bad, in the movie, as well. Sure hated to see the one character be killed at the end. Robert Pattinson did a great job, with his character.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing! It is filled with adventure, suspense, action, romance, and fighting. It leaves off at a cliff hanger that makes me want to read the next book!
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|It is something that should have been done by apple.  How tough is it to place the mouse on a cradle or platform instead of the pad.  This way the mouse is always charged.....
B00493E1GI|5.0|This movie was a good and gave a view of someone who lost their center and found their way back to themselves.  Albeit they traveled the world to do it, it was an interesting journey to discover what was seemingly lost wasn't really lost at all. Very uplifting.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|This book is a must have for writers. William Strunk's original book provided an excellent resourse for writers and it continues to be updated as needed for more modern writing.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|It was surprisingly good...sorta typical girl meets guy, guy rescues girl but with a twist. I enjoyed it and feel its a good romantic movie with hope.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My grandson loved this product. I can recommend this to make Legos users smile and to get brownie points as an awesome Nana. That's good enough for me.
B004GCJ11C|2.0|Wonderful book, but the book froze up on me.  I do not have more words to add to this recommendation.  Too bad it didn't work  : (
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great, and is handy to have on my kindle. I can get up to the minute information or a week's preview to help in planning.
B00005N5S2|2.0|Better presentation of MacArthur's role needed in his struggle with Truman. Better understanding why MacArthur wanted his promise &#34;I shall return&#34; needed to understand MacArthur's egocentricity. What was Franklin's concern regarding MacArthur when Nimitz had a better plan to by pass Manila and the Philippines?
B005ZKYXZI|1.0|What I don't like about this movie, has nothing to do with the movie at all. What I do not like is this item was listed and advertised as a (2) disc set, when in fact, it was not. The only disc in the package was the Blu-Ray disc. There was no second, DVD disc inluded.<br />In regards to the film, it is a good story and a over-all good movie. It is no blockbuster by any means but if you enjoy a good story, you will enjoy this one. I imagine you could compare this movie to the movie, Over the Top from 1987.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|This DVD presents Mozart's life in a much more controversial struggle with Salieri than does the movie show. Better presentation of the movie
B0071XO8RA|5.0|very good story, well written. there's obviously more to come in the story after this book, but i didn't feel like it left me hanging at the end like other books i've read.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I realize that not everyone loved this movie the way I did.  It takes me back to being young and seeing it in a theater for the first time.  My 5 year old son did not like the movie right off because of the scene with the dogs at the beginning.  We didn't get any further then that.  I have seen this movie at least 50 times over the years and still love it to this day.  Glad to see it on BluRay.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Does what it says on the tin for a really good price.<br /><br />Dropped my iPhone in the case and it was just fine.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I am a tough audience. Truly, I am. As an author, I have very high standards for what I believe is a well-written book. That doesn't mean it has to be pretentious or important. In fact, some of the more celebrated recent works aren't as interesting or as well-crafted as others that haven't been given such recognition. A great book makes you believe in the world you're reading about. Allows you to lose yourself in that world and forget that someone \\"wrote\\" it.<br /><br />As I read the first page, I thought there was no way I was going to want to read a fiction book about North Korea. The truth of North Korea is so ridiculous that it is hard to imagine connecting with it. By the second page, however,  I knew I would finish the book.<br /><br />This is a story of love and sacrifice and duty. There is perhaps nowhere else in the modern world but North Korea, where such a medieval story could be told. The torture, the hero worship, the deference to the anointed leader, the chasm between the peasants and the privileged, the deprivation, the hopelessness, the lack of self, the devaluation of the individual, all of these things could be straight out of a legend from 700 years ago, before the Renaissance, before the Enlightenment. And yet, this place exists here, now.<br /><br />Adam Johnson has brought it alive in an accessible way.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|This review is for the [[ASIN:B00C7JG0KG Oz the Great and Powerful (Blu-ray 3D + Digital Copy)]]<br /><br />This set includes a 3D blu-ray and a digital copy.  Why does it not also include a regular blu-ray disc?  What if I feel like watching the movie in 2D?  What if I want to show the watch the movie with my family, who are not fans of 3D?  What if I'm interested in watching the bonus materials (the special features are usually put on the 2D blu-ray disc)?<br /><br />\\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" could be the start of a dangerous new precedent - where studios can't give you both the 3D and 2D version, you get one or the other (and if you want both you have to buy the movie twice).  The way I see it, 3D is an add-on premium experience.  Anyone who wants to own the 3D should always get a complimentary 2D version included.<br /><br />Disney has announced that there will be an insert included with the 2D blu-ray release which will allow you to get order the 3D disc for $an extra 5.99, so it might be cost effective to pick up that version instead.  Hopefully Disney will read these reviews and see the backlash, and then never try this again.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I am an absolutely huge nicholas sparks fan and when i saw this movie was coming out i had to have it right away, so i pre-ordered it and it got to me the very next day that the movie came out!! i absolutely loved the movie it was great!!! if your a nicholas sparks romance lovey dovey type like me GET THIS MOVIE!!!!! :) LOL
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is, and always has been, my number one writer.  Her books have NEVER disappointed!  I did feel this one was over in an instant, and wished I could have just kept reading!  I guess I always feel that way when I read a great novel.  JUST KEEP GOING!  Mary Higgins Clark, you are still my NUMBER ONE!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Steve Jobs was one of the most fascinating and influential people of the past 40 years. Isaacson provides a riveting glimpse into his life, behavior, way of thinking and character that gives several interesting perspectives into what/who drove some of the most significant changes in our human environment. If I must nitpick, then the last part of the book was a bit too focused on the personal aspects and too much of a eulogy, relative to most of the book. Bottom line: Excellent read.
B009X011UQ|4.0|The only thing that I didn't like about my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 was holding it over long periods of time using the standard hardshell case that was suppose to stand up on it's own.  I bought this standing Case and I enjoy using much better than the hardshell case that I had.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This girl is so freakin talented! I don't care how many times her songs are played, I never grow tired of them.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|love all the temperance brennan series. Would recommend any and all to others for reading.  I watch the Bones series on TV also
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This movie didn't disappoint! It was such an emotional roller coaster but in a really good way. I would definitely recommend it.
B00631VJIC|3.0|Got this CD because I love the show.  Should have gotten the second season.  To many songs are repeated sung by different artists.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I don't usually play games on my phone, anymore anyway. But, this game is pretty ingenious in the way it merges the puzzle game with a platform side scrolling adventure game, plus it adds in the RPG angle with upgrades. I am really enjoying it.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|A very good read. Thoroughly enjoyed it. A great classic! This would be a fun book to read aloud to the whole family.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I thought this was one of the best dvd's i ever heard and seen,but then I bought a blueray player,The DTS HD MASTER AUDIO makes it 10 x better ! PETER GABRIEL  and the stage effects are awesome!!!!! No dvd library should be without this in it.....
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Like the rating says - it was o.k. Usually I enjoy Nicholas Sparks more than this. Very thin plot and did not hold my attention
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Just love 24. The tension and drama is gripping. The moral conflict and the choices that Jack Bauer has to make are virtually impossible. There often is no right choice. Is it a right choice to torture the bad guys, but save 2 million Los Angelenos from nuclear or biological destruction? Or is is better to follows the law to the letter and let the nuclear bomb or the nerve toxin take out the entire city? How can one live with one's conscience either way? And either way, people will point their fingers and call you the villain. This is the way real life is, and because it is so believeable, it is so captivating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game you can go to the nether spawn herobrine and fight zombies by it now worth the 7 dollars
B003L77GG0|2.0|Turned the original DC Comic characters into a soap opera. Deviated far too much from the original story. Also, way too much magic and crap like that, and not enough &#34;believeable&#34; science-fiction. But most of all, just way too much melodrama and hyped up romance (which never existed in the original stories). Also, seemed like they were almost plagiarizing X-men with the persecution of the &#34;mutants&#34;, except there was no Charles Xavier to guide them through it. And the characters were not as captivating as Magneto, Wolverine, Storm, Mystique, and the others.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is very well written and any fan of the series will enjoy this novel. Although this book is not as good as the hunger games, it still provides a very interesting story to the world we know. It sets up the third book perfectly. I am excited to read it
B005GG0MIS|4.0|A bit wordy, but there's lots of information that was not in the media. What I got out of this book is that politics is really DIRTY.  Anyone reading this book will never go into politics.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|it was glitchy at first, of course i bought the full version and that stopped. definitely good puzzles to solve. i felt the storyline jumped a bit, especially toward the end. overall good buy.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|Love this movie. So much better with Colin Farrell, I remember the one I grew up with not much yum factor there.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great on the kindle fire HD and I like how far ahead It gives me definitely a five star app for sure
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|NBC's Hannibal is one of the most engaging, intelligent shows on the air. It's a serious show with serious themes and contains elements that many \\"like\\" shows lack. How often in other shows do you get long conversations between characters about the construct of the mind? This series makes you think about humanity and sanity in a self-reflective manner. It's not a comedy or drama with cheap antics designed to get more viewers. It remains well-thought out and still captivating. The themes are dark and there is plenty of gore, yes. There should not be an excuse for it because that's what it is. It's a show about a special agent of the FBI tracking down the most insane killers on the planet and his cannibalistic psychiatrist. It's appropriate for the subject matter.
B00B4804KS|5.0|It's an oldie, sure, but seeing it in 3D was fun.  I watched it at home with my wife and some friends. We all enjoyed it. Even my wife, who is not a big fan of 3D said it was good.  If you have a 3D TV, this is one movie worth having.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love all the twist and turns for the plot.  With the producers willing to kill off characters and have new ones come in makes it more interesting than most shows.
B009R659L8|5.0|I am a fan of Mary Higgins Clark, and have been for decades, literally. Quite frankly, the last few of her novels have &#34;shown her age,&#34; but not Daddy's Gone A Hunting. Mary is back with her superb ability to keeps many characters a subplots going till the end. The suspense never lets up. Great plot, many twists and turns. So wonderful to read an author that really has mastered her trade.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great sequel! Leaves you wanting more, broke my heart as I was going through but worth it when I made it to the end!
B00BF11STU|4.0|This is a great movie. However I consider that it was a little bit long. But I will definitely recommend to watch it.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This was a good read and helped me move from procrastination to action.<br />This is a quick read. Do it.<br />The internal dialogue about should I or shouldn't I is just resistance. Wondering if anyone will read you work is resistance. stop procrastinating and get it done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever. I LIKE THE COMPUTER MUCH BETTER. GET THE COMPUTER VERSION. You don't know life until you have played it.
B00993I6D2|5.0|When this movie was first released, big brother seemed like a remote possibility to most of us. Now is a good time to revisit this subject!
1401235417|5.0|What a ride. An amazing story that pits Batman against these new adversaries The Court Of Owls. Bane might have broken Batman physically but the court broke him mentally definitely. This story is up there with Batman: Year One and The Long Halloween.
B009R659L8|5.0|Another hit. Several twists and turns in this one.Ms.  Clark does not disapoint . Would definately reccomend this novel to  all mystery lovers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's an all around fun game to play. Great for any horse lover looking for something new and fun to do on the go.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I was great to get this 2 disc collection of Elton John hits.  Plays great, a bit of storage smell, but I will assume that will go away. Doug
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I've seen this movie before and loved it, so I needed to order it! I would definitely recommend Chasing Mavericks!
B00A6CT012|4.0|I was challenged by this book, and also by Ms. Johnson's blog.  I already compost and recycle.  After reading the blog and the book, REFUSE is my goal.  I love Ms. Johnson's uncluttered home!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel Washington did a great job depicting a individual struggling with addiction. Although a long movie, it was entertaining throughout with no slow moments.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|I like that when you Don't complete a task it carries over to the next day. About the only thing is that sometimes it crashes, but hey it is free.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book was not as boring as some claim.  It was the continuance and setup of one of the best stories in modern times.  Without giving spoilers the fifth book in the series sets the next book up nicely for an action packed story while bringing details together from the fourth book.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|The board is perfect for a budget 'working' computer that will sport higher-end equipment. Bios is slow by default but can be changed easily. All 4 DIMM slots read as they should. I haven't pushed overclocks terribly high yet but Phenom II X4's are hobbled by the 4.0GHz wall anyway and I don't have a newer AMD chip to really push the motherboard. Onboard sound is okay (it's onboard sound, I don't have high expectations) and I haven't tested the SPDIF-out yet. Color scheme is very nice and neutral, easy to plan a build around if you're not into painting components.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of it is the PCI slot layout. If you have a legacy PCI slot peripheral (like a previous-gen Creative sound card) then your crossfire and SLI options are limited and will all have terrible air flow - you'll need to either stack the cards on top of each other where the bottom GPU blocks the top's intakes and the PCI card blocks the bottom GPU's intakes, and/or put a card on the bottom PCI slot and have it blocked by the power supply in a typical tower case. This is a non-issue if you're watercoolng but may mess with your aesthetic mojo if you're going for uniform spacing. Also a non-issue if you don't have an old sound card like me.<br /><br />Having said this, they put a little PCI slot just above the first x16 for a newer sound card. Makes me warm and fuzzy to see that little courtesy included.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Fascinating story of a fascinating woman, whose brain anomalies tell us a lot about the value of accommodating people who are different in some way.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|It does exactly what I wanted it to do. It's been my primary source of USB audio for my computer. It has a nice black background (no noise when plugged in) and all of its features seem to function well. I especially like how solidly the cable jacks snap and lock into place. However, because it recognizes USB slightly differently than USB spec wants, it's very hard to get working with Android phones to use as a portable phone DAC/amp; the app USB Audio Recorder Pro helps with some phones but not others. I do not feel my money was poorly spent and knowing what I do now I'd still buy it again.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Cool game, hard to put down,keeps me pushing to go farther,faster.Can't wait for more vehicles and more stages.It just keeps you wanting more.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was recommended on Twitter via smutclub.com and smi book club.  After reading the blurb of the book, I had to get it.  Ms. Chase writes in Drew's POV, which is not common often.  When reading Tangled, you would think that Ms. Chase was really a man, she really got into the way a man thinks and speaks, it was BRILLANT!!!!!  Drew an I-Banker is a manwhoring playboy until he meets his match, Kate.  He first meets her at a club not knowing that she will be working at the very same firm he is a partner.  When he meets her, all he can think about is doing her, literally.  When she does not fall for his charms (mind you she tells him she's engaged, he doesn't care).  Soon they have to work together (or rather compete) for an account, and boy do the sparks fly (in good and bad ways).  I don't want to spoil the book for those who have yet to read it, but please do!  The book is so freaking funny, that I am still laughing (wait until you read about Thanksgiving dinner, try not to be drinking anything when you do, because you will spill it out of your nose like I did lol).  Ms. Chase's witty banter reminds me of one of my favorite authors, Alice Clayton.  I can't wait for more fun reads by Ms. Chase.
B008LODRT8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and look forward to another sequel as the author's style of writing keeps me on the edge of my seat!
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I've watched this movie 5 times and every time I find something new or something makes more sense.... One of the best movies I've seen
0618680004|5.0|Even though it was used I got my copy from a professors's personal library so the condition was great. I recommend this book to anybody who is unsure of their stance on religion or anyone who just wants to delve deeper into why people like myself and others just don't buy into religion. Great novel.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season three is the best of three great seasons. The characters and story are both fantastic.  I can't wait for season four!
B003DWG29A|3.0|I read good reviews about this movie but was overall underwhelmed.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of the gritty black and white.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watched Season one. Couldn't wait to get to Season two. This original UK version is the best. I am now starting Season 3 and am not disappointed.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this fame is different than arcade games and is fun to play and solve the mystery. I love playing this fame its a lot if fun.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Going through the same things.....divorce ......made me cry and laugh.  Perfect weekend read for everybody.  Recommend to everybody that has ever needed time off
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Not a very helpful review, but I loved this trilogy of intense chase scenes and cleverly crafted fights that drew me into the series from the first installment.
B005HSL626|3.0|I decided to try this game because my kids and friends are playing it and seem to enjoy it. The game itself is interesting and not difficult to play but to really enjoy it you have to read all the instructions on how to play first. If you don't you will become bored rather quickly and miss out on some of the fun that is in the game.<br /><br />My rating is deceptive, this is an overall score. As I mentioned about the rules and instructions that is a downer so I gave it a 3 but play itself is a 5.
0783226063|5.0|I have loved this visionary epic movie done to Frank Herbert's Dune since the first time I watched it.  Although the book was a masterpiece, I believe I prefer the movie to the book which is rare in most cases.  The acting, the special effects, the cinematography, the visceral nature of the movie and it's grand scale draws you in.  I hear it was originally released in theaters with a guidebook to help understand its complexities.  Basically, the universe runs on spice mined on the desert planet.  The emperor maintains power through political intrigue by warring the great houses/planets against each other.  But, a messiah comes to make it all right again. Awesome martial arts concept as well.
B008L40Q7E|2.0|A little bit too fantastic for my taste.  &#34;From Russia With Love&#34; was way better. But I have only read those two.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game. Keeps you thinking. One of the best games I've purchased. I would recommend this game to all gamers.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I loved meeting the new characters. They are very relatable and funny at times. I had a hard time putting the book down and I hope we see more of these characters. If you are a Sophie Kinselka fan, it's a must read! I loved every minute of the book.
1616551151|5.0|This book is amazing, it filled with beautiful images tons of information about the world of Thedas. It's great for any GM to have to polish up on some history. Lots of background information on the world. You can easily make up a campaign using the information in this book.<br /><br />When I ordered the book it was not going to be shipped for about a week, So I bought a nook and bought the ebook version. Well that ebook was not released until the end of the month & then that book doesn't work on nook. Guess I should of just bought a kindle. I still would of been boned because of the ebooks release date.<br /><br />That's the only part that pissed me off, was the the ebook and book were not released at the same time.
0765325950|5.0|Fantastic! I have been reading this series since the early 90's, and I must say, &#34;Wow!&#34; Mr. Sanderson kept his writing true to Mr. Jordan's story and style. There were a couple of minor things I personally might have wanted to know about, but overall this was a really great ending to a really spectacular series. A must-read for fantasy fans.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thought this book is very well written and have enjoyed it very much.  An interesting take on segregation the suppresion of women.  Good read.
1612680011|5.0|the book is good, not as much as hoped for......got for a gift and that was his response.....but he said he still was glad he got it and read it.
