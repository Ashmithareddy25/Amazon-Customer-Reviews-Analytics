0810160064|5.0|In the fall of 1878, the then-twenty-seven-year-old Robert Louis Stevenson found himself alone in France, abandoned by the woman he loved, who had returned to America and her estranged husband.  Lonely and depressed, RLS decided to take a walking tour through the highlands of the C&eacute;vennes.  For twelve days he hiked 120 miles through a rugged, wooded, sparsely populated land.  He then wrote a short account of that trek.  Published in 1879, it was, excepting ephemera, Stevenson's second published book and it became a minor classic, among the first of the genre of literary travel-writing.<br /><br />Not confident that he would be able to find nightly accommodations for sleeping during his journey, RLS had a \\"sleeping-sack\\" custom-made for his trip.  It proved too cumbersome for him to carry, so he bought a donkey to be his sherpa and traveling companion.  Diminutive, unprepossessing, and mouse-brown, she was christened Modestine, and, charmingly, she made her way into the title of RLS's account of the trip:  TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY.  (A gilt portrait of Modestine adorns the front cover of my copy of the first American edition of the book, from 1879.)<br /><br />Initially, RLS thought he would simply let Modestine set her own pace:  \\"What that pace was, there is no word mean enough to describe; it was something as much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a run; it kept me hanging on each foot for an incredible length of time; in five minutes it exhausted the spirit and set up a fever in all the muscles of the leg.\\"  And that proved to be just the beginning of RLS's vexations with Modestine.  A good part of the book is devoted to the trials and tribulations of their partnership, yet at the end of the journey RLS confesses to shedding a tear over their parting.<br /><br />Much of the book, of course, is the usual fare of a travel book --  a description of the territory traversed (in this case forests, gorges, massifs, and vistas) and the towns and people encountered.  RLS handles this much more engagingly than many from the succeeding generations of travel writers.<br /><br />Yet another topic has to do with religious factionalism.  RLS himself was a \\"heretic\\", but he had been raised a Presbyterian, steeped in the traditions of the wars between the Scottish Covenanters and a Catholic monarchy.  The C&eacute;vennes had been the mountain redoubt of the Camisards or Huguenots, and thus it had been the site of religious persecution and rebellion.  RLS is sensitive to this setting of religious conflict and he gently mocks the very notion of one true faith:  \\"Thus, to the high entertainment of the angels, do we pelt each other with evangelists, like schoolboys bickering in the snow.\\"  Several times during his journey RLS becomes engaged in discussions of religious matters, and he steadfastly projects an ecumenical approach to life.  When met by an old man who revealed himself to be a fundamentalistic Plymouth Brother, RLS writes:  \\"Of what that involves in the way of doctrine I have no idea nor the time to inform myself; but I know right well that we are all embarked upon a troublesome world, the children of one Father, striving in many essential points to do and to become the same.\\"<br /><br />Overall, a century and a third later, TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY is on the quaint side, but nonetheless it is enchanting.  Stevenson's prose is marvelous.  But what is best and most memorable about the book is the good humor, magnanimity, and open-armed humanity of its author.<br /><br />TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY is perhaps most famous for Stevenson's expression of the credo of a certain breed of traveler.  In response to the rhetorical question of why anyone would desire to visit certain small villages of the C&eacute;vennes, RLS writes:  \\"I travel not to go anywhere, but to go.  I travel for travel's sake.  The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life more nearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilisation, and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.\\"ranite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.\\"

B008QMMEOE|4.0|This app is all about puzzles. My 2 1/2 year old is so into putting them together. Easy and fun!
B0090SI42Y|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but it wowed more than it disappoionted. If you watched all the old Bruce Lee movies than you can see many of those aspects in the film as well as a little Clint Eastwood from his Sergio Leone movies. Total nonstop action from the get go. A good amount of gore, but it's not raining blood. Those movies put me off. No nudity, but a good deal of sexual situations. A little more character development would've been appreciated, as in I'm not really sure who the main character was. A really good performance from Russel Crowe, wasn't expecting it due to the type of film. Rick Yune did great as his character. Thought he was the main character until Crowe's showed up. But I think RZA was supposed to be the main character, which is really bad casting on his part. Just because you wrote and directed the film doesn't mean you have to star in it. He's not very built at all for the blacksmith character he's supposed to portray. He should've got someone else or hit the gym. Other than that, decent action flick. Reminds of the old spaghetti westerns and kung fu movies from the 70's.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! It was fun to read and kept me entertained! Look forward to more books from this author!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game has kept my attention. I got this game as a free app of the day but it would be worth it to buy. It does allow you to zoom except on differences. So earlier reviews about the zoom are incorrect. The only issue I was having is items at the top are sometimes hard to see because of the bar.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great book. Different from most books I have read lately. Very interesting characters and story line. Read the entire thing in a day.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|Overall, Pandemonium was a relatively enjoyable read up until the very end. I enjoyed the changes we saw in Lena, from her becoming a little less whiny and a little more capable to her learning to express those primal human emotions that make us tick--anger, desire, happiness, familial love. Seeing her learn to interact with other people who express those emotions was interesting as well, and I was much more invested in her character this time around. I also didn't mind Julian for the most part, but there were inconsistencies in his character and his relationship with Lena that just gnawed at me. Maybe it's the fact that he needed rescuing all the time, yet he's the one always reaching out and steadying her. If she's the one who has had to rough it in the wild and he's the pampered rich boy, how is it that she is always exhausted and falling down everywhere and he isn't? Especially shortly after he has been beaten up and is still healing?<br /><br />I really liked new characters Raven and Tack, both for their personalities and the roles they played in Lena's new life. Raven in particular had a couple visceral, emotional moments with Lena that were outstanding. Unfortunately, their characters took a jarring turn near the end of the book and then overcorrected with very little explanation. Either one of these changes could make sense to me taken alone; both together just felt lazy.<br /><br />This book is setup so that every chapter alternates between being 'now' and 'then'--'then' beginning where book 1 ended and 'now' jogging ahead to a later time. Despite hating this setup at the beginning, it grew on me as time went on. The problem is that there is never any moment where the two time periods connect. Though there are characters from 'then' who show up in 'now' and new skills and attitudes that also make the leap, the plot never does. I kept waiting for the final 'then' sections to become the beginning of 'now', but it never happened. It's like she was writing twotrain cars that were eventually going to join up, only to discover they were running on parallel tracks and she was too lazy to switch them over.<br /><br />This brings me to the end--the main reason for the 3-star rating and a prime example of a phenomenon I have come to call the 'Catching Fire Effect'. I loved Catching Fire, but its ending of OMG CLIFFHANGER set a terrible precedent for how to end book 2 in teen dystopian trilogies. I'm pretty sure every teen series I've read since Hunger Games has made use of this device, and it's dreadful. To put it in television terms, there is always a series arc and a season arc. I'll give Oliver props for wrapping up the book 2 arc, but throwing in that final half a page is cheap, frustrating to the readers, and is (theoretically) unnecessary. You have to count on your series arc being strong enough to bring readers back for the next installment without the bait of OMG, WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN AFTER THIS COMPLETELY UNFORESEEABLE TURN OF EVENTS?! Also, did anyone really NOT see that coming?<br /><br />EDIT: For those readers who, like me, are hypersensitive to violence against animals, be warned there is a scene that will make you squirm. It's not as graphic as the one in Delirium, but it was difficult for me to get through nonetheless.

B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Just a poor attempt at milking a little more money off of the Resident Evil name. Milla was as hot as ever, but the plot was nonsensical and wasn't consistent with the other movies. Very poor writing and the action sequences felt fake.
B0001Z37HM|5.0|I loved watching this movie I watched it with my daughter and grandson Arnold Schwarzenegger is my favorite actor I always enjoy his movies
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie is good - saw it with the kids two times in the theater, and got them this for Christmas.  It's violent, but much of the violence is left to the imagination (a la Hitchcock).  The story is based on the premise that each year two children are selected by lot from each of twelve districts, and then they fight to the death for the entertainment of the ruling class.  The distinction between the haves and have-nots is clearly developed - perhaps exaggerated.  People who remember Woody Harrelson from cheers will love his performance.  Much of the movie is shot with a shaky, hand-held appearance that bothers some viewers, but I think it works.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movie I enjoy watching it with my grandson and with my daughter we love Arnold
B007FJFDXS|3.0|I've only played a few times but find the game to be well designed and engrossing.  I really love the concept of the game too. Sadly, this game is just too challenging for someone like myself.  My fine motor skills are just not up to the task.  I expect that IF I continue to play I might improve a bit, but I do know my limitations.  I would recommend the game however if you do not have clumsy hands, or arthritis as I do, it might not be the game for you.
B001TK80C0|5.0|This movie was very interesting I enjoyed watching it with my grandson and with my daughter I will share it with my family

B002VWNID6|1.0|I guess I now see why it was only $4.99 for this DVD. I received this and it was only half of the movie! It stops<br />Halfway through, and only let's you start the movie over again; there is no second half of the movie. Even if you<br />Try to skip to the scenes option from the menu. There are only three scenes sequences to skip through. What a ripoff!

B001A4LYN2|2.0|If you like DDL, this movie is ok.  The story is intriguing except that the main character turns into a real jerk.  That is not a good note to end on as far as I am concerned.  A little too much violence for the ladies.
B002ELIXCA|4.0|What a fascinating ride through the mind of a serial killer. It can be disturbing but never ceases to be interesting. Good story, good acting, very good program.

B00AERRKHA|5.0|Captain Vorpatril's Alliance is a chance to view life through the eyes of Ivan Vorpatril and where others still see a blithering idiot we are given an opportunity to understand Ivan's character reflected through his experiences. I thought LMB was very clever to keep her previously central characters on the periphery and to focus mostly on Ivan. It is truly his story with references to past adventures that show a different emphasis.  Here is a man who was traumatised as a little boy by not having a father, who is clever but has feelings of inadequacy due to comparisons with his over achieving relatives and who has been thrust into a lifestyle he would prefer to avoid. Ivan is the hero of this story and we realise has always been a hero in trying to live up to others expectations. He does get his just rewards: not honours, power or money but exile with Tej to a desert island on a planet far, far away. This is his idea of heaven.<br /><br />Once again LMB's prose is a delight to read with sly humour inserted through out the story. I loved the idea of the Vor Horseman of the Apocolypse and the Voralphabet. She has once again slipped in her own special word so look carefully for it. Her character descriptions are as lively and vivid as ever. Shiv Arqua is described as being \\"like a man suffering from the sharpest twinge of existential pain in history\\" when he is forced to relinquish money. We immediately understand what sort of man By is when he is described as \\" underneath the persiflage, camouflage and just plain flage, he was high Vor of the highest.....\\"<br /><br />One minor annoyance is why have Kindle readers had to wait so much longer than hardcopy readers or even audio listeners. Shouldn't it be easy enough for all forms of publication of a new book to be released at the same time?<br /><br />Maybe Captain Vorpatril's Alliance did not have as much derring-do as usual, maybe it did not have as much inter-stellar mayhem but it is still an engaging tale with memorable characters. I really enjoyed it.

0321885112|5.0|Anyone with basic sales skills knows confused people don't take action. If your job depends on others acting upon your ideas, you will get through to them much more often if you learn to **draw** those ideas. I end up explaining _something_ to _someone_ every day, so to improve my communication skills I recently read this book.<br /><br />## Why buy this instead of another book?<br /><br />If you're like me and are primarily looking to improve your communication skills, you might be inclined to buy a \\"drawing 101\\" type book. I've been down this road and it's hard to recommend as a first step.<br /><br />Those books tend to focus on concepts like drawing accurate 3D perspective, human figure drawing, shading/shadows, etc. Those are great skills to have, but it's way overachieving if you're just trying to get ideas across. I would say it's icing on the cake, but it's more like sprinkles _on top_ of the icing on the cake.<br /><br />## OK so...what, exactly, is in the book?<br /><br />To oversimplify, the book covers the following topics:<br /><br />- Sketchnoting 101: What is it? Why do it?<br />- Sketchnoting Process and Structure: How does it work? What does it look like?<br />- Basic Sketching Skills: Help! I can't draw.<br /><br />I didn't completely understand the whole book would be fully illustrated, somewhat like a children's book. So it's sort of a living example of the principles, and there are also many sketchnote examples specifically included. It's very engaging and makes it easy to get through.<br /><br />Although it's a fast read, take the time to stop and practice drawing the simple shapes mentioned in the text. You're wasting your time if you don't. If you can't draw your way out of a paper bag, the drawing tips toward the end of the book will get you going and build your confidence.<br /><br />One more tip: watch the videos. You will pick up great details like how Mike holds the paper flat and works in a slow, deliberate manner. This yields a clean, simple style that works as well on a whiteboard or iPad as it does on paper.simple style that works as well on a whiteboard or iPad as it does on paper.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and believe it is one of the best of the series.  Most lingering questions were answered and loose ends tie.  In the end, the characters settled in for what I hope will be their next adventure.  The three companion stories (Pendergast/Swenson/Greene) was a nice change.  I very much enjoy the Pendergast series having read all the books.  I look forward to the next!

0307970299|5.0|This is a review for the Audio CD. I just finished listening and quite simply loved every minute of it. Having been an amateur hiker myself a few years ago, I could relate fully to many of her experiences. (Pack too heavy, toes bloodied from hiking downhill in ill-fitting boots). Some of the reviews are scathing and I can only feel that this simply wasn't the type of book those reviewers should have read. Who cares if her decisions were not well thought out (and I cringed at many of them). I felt fear for her at every turn (hiking alone, especially for a woman is fool hardy). Who of us hasn't made poor decisions in our life. We each take our own journey and hopefully learn from our mistakes. I was inspired and felt tearful when her journey was over. She never gave up. I felt all of the emotion she felt about losing her mother and quite simply loved that as she was coming to the end of her journey she began to question some of the decisions her own mother had made and perhaps wasn't so perfect after all.  Thank you Cheryl Strayed and thank you Bernadette Dunn (who did a wonderful job of reading this adventure)  I LOVED IT!!
B00018D44U|3.0|So long ago, I have no idea whether it is a success, but certainly family member in US likes this artist
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|...so I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie pretty entertaining. It had several laugh out loud moments, but don't expect any plot twists or anything.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This is not a Oscar comedy, but if you like basic adult humor you will like the movie. It has some good moments.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Aaron Cross, the main character, is a more interesting, 3 dimensional character than Jason Bourne.  The second main character, played by Rachel Weisz, is a far more entertaining and well-rounded character than the euro-trash girlfriend in the Jason Bourne series.  Die-hard Matt Damon fans might be disappointed, but I personally thought it was a more entertaining movie than the first 3.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book! Looking forward to the movie with Julianne and Josh! My first Sparks book but not my last!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed it as much, if not more, than the first book! Looking forward to the third and final book in this trilogy.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This classic movie is even better in color. I am very satisfied with this purchase, which was delivered as promised.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|.Great graphics and functionality. Love the versatility and ease of setup. I would recommend the app either free or paid.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King.  I have not read one of his books in awhile, so this was a pleasure getting back to his works. The man's mind is stimulating to say the least.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I love this app. I have it on both my kindle fire hd and my smart phone. They sync together so I knoe I will never forget a project.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Its a very nice balance of clever and fart jokes. Super funny! However it is weird hearing Peter Griffin's voice coming out of something so cute.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My husband and I love playing settlers even just with the two of us. We've also taught it to many of our board game-playing friends and relatives, and it's always a hit. I would describe it as a cross between Monopoly and Pit.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was captivating in every way. I rarely review books but this one was so good I had to. This isn't your typical forbidden love book. There are so many twists and turns and unexpected things that happen through the book that it never gets boring. I read it in less than 24 hours because I couldn't put it down. I promise you will love this book. Colleen Hoover is amazing!
B009NOGSQE|5.0|Men In Black II seems a bit slower these days than it did when I was younger; but, overal the film holds up as a great man versus alien film with a great heart and some quirky comedy. I made this purchase for my daughter to see the movie, we got MIBIII for Christmas and we wanted to go back and see where it all began - again.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|good show for adults, arrived quickly and at a great price . have told my friends and  another one ordered it
B0094LV1D6|5.0|Men In Black seems a bit slower these days than it did when I was younger; but, overal the film holds up as a great man versus alien film with a great heart and some quirky comedy.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Exciting story line, held my interesting & couldn't wait until the end to see if they suceeded.  Almost as good as the Camel Club stories but a different setting.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|Overall a good series of books. There were a few times that the story dragged on but then would get exciting again. I would recommend them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Held my attention & kept me guessing with lots of twists & turns.  Couldn't wait to see how it ended.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Love the film and the wit of all the actors. recommend!!!! Both Expendable films are good shoot em up action flick that will be enjoyed over and over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it rocks you will love it it is like temple run this game you must have
B009E3EY38|5.0|Love it !!!!!! You are here because you love Zeppelin and know how great they are. I remember hearing the 1st album over a friends house and couldnt believe how good they were.  And Jason Bonham does a great job filling in for his father.  Recommended for all !!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This 8 disk set sure made my Christmas. I love Harry Potter movies and never owned them and when I saw the 8 disk set for about 28$ on Amazon, I had to have them!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  The action, adventure, love twist.  Great story and cannot wait to read book 2!  The ending really leaves you hanging!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It seems to be a little lacking in deals or different types of solitaire.  I play it but only because I am bored.
0307341577|4.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn novel / audiobook, and I quite enjoyed it! I thought the first half of this novel was much gristlier and better than the second. As with the Millenium Trilogy, I wonder if the author felt some need to make the female protagonist a little more likeable towards the end.
B00902MCVY|5.0|As the highly anticipated sequel to their stellar debut, this album had very high expectations to meet. Upon first listening to it, I was thrown off since it sounded very different. But after a few spins, it has really grown on me. Although this is only part 1 of what should have been an 80 min long album, it felt a bit short and incomplete, but what is presented to us is so good that I didn't feel like docking a star off. It really should be reviewed as a whole since that's how Jari conceptualized it from the start, but the first part is still amazing on its own. Highly recommend this to fans of melodic metal, but it may take a few spins to really appreciate this one.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This version is much more believable than the previous, but is still science fiction.  Action scenes are cause more adrenaline rush.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a very exciting book, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I couldn't stop reading. I'd recommend it to everyone.
0060853972|5.0|I could not put this book down. I highly recommend it if you want to laugh and find British humor amusing.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was a very good and funny book. Totally worth the money. Buy it! Make sure not to get if you only like the ones with Heather.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me \\"hero\\", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Short, sweet, and so much sexual tension! Great for the cold weekend indoors! Hot guy, cute girl, what else is there?
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|What an amazing game. It's one of the best I've ever had! You definitely should get it! It's one great game for the kindle.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I bought this Fiio E6 amplifier to go with my HiFiMan RE262s.  The size of this time is amazing.  Very small and light.  The unit came well charged and seems to last all day when listening at a comfortable volume.  The controls are very simple with LED feedback to know what setting is being used.  My only complaint is that the EQ indication LED is on the back on the unit.  I would rather the clear corner LED was used to indicate both the device being turned on and the EQ setting.  Having to look at the back of the device to set EQ is a small hassle but not a deal breaker.  Just seems a little shorted sighted from a design standpoint.  The EQ settings can add some more flavor to some bland headphones so if you have an analytical set of phones, give this little amp a try before buying a new $150+ set of phones.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|This movie took a good long while to get going.  I purchased for two reasons.  Steven Spielberg and location.  I guess I should have read more reviews because I had no idea how boring of a story this was.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this as part of a zombie survival gift set.  I looked at other books but those seemed too serious.  This one gives some good tips but with a sense of humor.  I recommend this for teens and early twenty-somethings but not for the serious doomsday prepper.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|As with any video game based movie,  you have to go in with an open mind knowing that there will be some things that are unbelievable.  Isn't that the point of these movies?  They brought back some characters and without a spoiler,  I was caught off guard with some of the points. But don't go in thinking that the story will keep you on edge because it won't. As usual the best part is the action sequences  plus its only 1.5 hours so you don't have to devote an entire evening to it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was a surprise hit for me.  My wife requested we rent it because she knew it was directed or written by someone that worked on 30 Rock.  The music is great, the comedy is hilarious and very well timed, and the story is pretty decent.  Rebel Wilson steals the show but others deliver great performances as well.  Prepare some popcorn, get ready to tap your feet, and let the laughs begin.
1882723007|5.0|The best book ever written about NDE....For anyone who lost a loved one this will bring you so much peace
B002WY65VU|5.0|TWINKIES!!!<br /><br />I put together a zombie survival gift set for Christmas and this was a must have. Great comedy and a heck of a deal.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I found them on Pandora and decided to just buy the whole album. I like every song (a rarity for me). Trying to describe their sound... maybe coldplay meets the lumineers... I dunno...I just like it. Can't wait to hear this live.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just when I thought I knew what was going to or did happen, something would still surprise me.  I loved the book and couldn't stop reading it.  I honestly think it would make a great movie!
B0076794IO|3.0|Like many a debut novel, The Expats is not without its flaws.  It gets off to a slow start, so slow in fact that had I not got this for 20p on Kindle, I may well have given up.<br /><br />As a serial expat myself and someone who has worked helping other expats readjust to their new life, Kate comes across as a relocation consultant's worst nightmare - a whiny, trailing spouse with way too much time on her hands.<br /><br />I found the characters very unlikeable and I couldn't understand why Kate just didn't call it a day with Dexter, children or no children.  Theirs is a loveless marriage so what was she doing playing along with the move to Europe for so long? Julia and Bill come across as two-dimensional and I don't really care what happens to them.<br /><br />If you can stick with it and suspend your disbelief, in the end the book does have something useful to say about marriage and relationships - that we all hide secrets from each other.<br /><br />The action and pace picks up in the second half and it becomes a tightly plotted (if somewhat implausible) read.  There's an over reliance on character exposition in last part of the book which is a little irritating but given the complex nature of the plot may be the only way that readers of commercial fiction will understand what it is that is supposed to have gone on.<br /><br />The Expats has been skilfully marketed and managed to gain an impressive number of press reviews, some of which raved about it.  The most accurate to my mind was the one written by The Washington Post, which calls it \\"a sometimes silly spy tale.\\"
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Any Soundgarden fan should get this album. Its as great a Rock effort as you'll find in this era of music. Tops the Foo Fighters' recent \\"wasted light,\\" for example. I think given the hype of a new SG album after 15 years of no new music, more than a few people will inevitably be disappointed. Lets keep this in context though.. think about GNR's Chinese Democracy.. the hype for that album completely deflated and cast aside as garbage what was otherwise a solid album. Well King Animal tops that \\"comeback\\" threefold. It is a fantastic, fantastic record. No other act but Soundgarden could have given us this.<br /><br />In terms of quality.. I would say this reaches and tops the quality of something like the bottom third of the songs on Superunknown. Remember though.. that that is one of the greatest albums ever made by anyone in rock or otherwise. And that must be the standard by which we hold King Animal. If Superunknown is a 5, this is a 4. I really think that Soundgarden can give us another 5 though once they get going and have had a bit more time to get the cobwebs and rusted cogs out of the SG machine.<br /><br />Great to have you back, Soundgarden!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Certainly held my interest throughout. Acting was good, I thought, and I really like the main actors. If one hadn't seen the previous Bourne movies, you might miss a little something but it would still be a good movie to watch. The ending kind of left me wanting for more. Hmm.......
B004U52VPS|4.0|Entertains my 5 year old and gets her off my phone from playing the game.  Just know you wont be able to shoot the birds more than 2 feet or so.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have been a real John Grisham fan and have read just about all his books.  This novel &#34;The Racketeer&#34;, however, just left me flat!  Grisham did indicate that he did not do much by way of research for this novel; I believe him.  The story just did not make any sense and left me bewildered most of the way through.  As a result, I won’t be very eager to spend another $12.99 on his next novel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great,cool,so amazing,astounding, more than I expected,speaks to me,touches my heart,tear shedding, awesome, great, this is outstanding on so many levels
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box deals with a very cold case, but turns into a very current affair.  The twists and turns of the novel are breath taking and lead in directions unimaginable.  The author held my interest from beginning to end and I just couldn’t get enough!  Needless to say, “I liked It a lot”!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|fun great puzzles nice mystery well worth the money great pictures used helpna lot but just to know where to go next ready for the next one
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The Winter of the World was an excellent production of combining fiction and History.  The story is compelling and allows the reader to gain some great insights on the how’s and why’s of the Second World War.  Follett, as usual, makes the story quite visual and helps me understand why the generation of that era was recognized as great.
0143038583|5.0|The book offers a eye opening of what goes in your system and how important it is to know what is on your plate.
0811879542|5.0|I bought 2 of these to give as gifts. Both sets of parents (and the rest of us) were super amused by this book! I recommend this to parents to read to babies through early elementary school-age children.  Visually, and mentally stimulating
B0098VXMNE|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. It is no holds bare with the sex and violence but that isn't the best part. It would seem like a show just meant for men, but it has a strong story centered around love and the things we do to fight for it, even if it means killing somebody. I would definetly recommend this show to everybody. I was a little secticle of watching the new season after the death of Andy Whitfield, but Liam McIntyre has done an excellent job filling his shoes. Sometimes you forget that your watching a new guy, because you just get so lost in the show. Can't wait for the next season to start.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is an easy read. It kept my interest through and through. The characters really come alive and capture my attention.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Much better than what I thought it was going to be! Great action. Can't wait to watch the next one.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Fits Canon 40D perfectly, with room for all the accessories I have. It fits my lens great with great protection.
B000ID37LS|3.0|I remembered \\"The Frighteners\\" as a Robert Zemeckis movie, but he's only the producer of this.  For some reason, I remember it as being more of a fun movie about ghosts in the way that Death Becomes Her was fun and not really scary.  \\"The Frighteners\\" is really very scary at times and is pretty intense.<br /><br />It's a good movie...but not at all for kids.  You have to be in the right mood for this one.  I felt like watching something more like 'Death Becomes Her' and had to turn The Frighteners off about halfway through because I just didn't feel like seeing something that intense that night.  That's not the movie's fault...it's my own memory of it since the last time I watched this was probably 13 years ago.<br /><br />I think having Michael J. Fox in it as well made me think it would be more light-hearted like the Back to the Future movies or Teen Wolf...but this is probably the only intense and scary thing that Fox ever did.<br /><br />It's a fun surprise seeing Chi McBride in this, years before he was on Pushing Daisies.  He's funny in it, as are the other two ghosts who are friends with Fox.
B004QX07G4|4.0|This book was a fun fast read that I didn't want to put down! Reading this book you can't help but laugh
B00632HWOG|1.0|Used to work fine for my Kindle Fire, but since the last update it won't let me log in (can still log in on my other devices so it's not my username and password). Even deleting and reinstalling doesn't help for me. Very disappointed because it worked perfectly before the last update. Please fix this soon!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really fun! Need more ways to earn acorns. I am addicted to this and the animations are very colorful and creative.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|One of the best John Wane movies ever.  This movie is great for the entire family and should be a part of everyone's video library
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved every second of this book! I can't wait for the movie....! It has been a while since I had the time to read anything other than a children's book, and of course, once I started I couldn't put out down.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This one one of the best episodes in the entire 5 year year run.  Showed how the 2 main characters continue to build professional and personnal topics with each other.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exactly what I expected. :) the entire book had me wanting more, I couldn't put it down! On to the next
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is wonderful! An amazing, thrilling story, combined with pictures that are creepy yet beautiful in their own way makes for a riveting story that I will keep reading again and again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the book so much so that I had to read the other two books in the trilogy right away. This is the beauty of a kindle just read and order the next one. Instant gratification. Just like this novel. It has very racy parts but the story line is very interesting it keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Don't read if you don't have time to read them all because you have to. It shows you another world out there.
B006O6FK2W|3.0|I bought this for my nephew and he was thrilled with it.  But I only saw him play with it for 10-15 minutes before he put it aside for something else.  It seemed to be kind of one-trick pony.  He liked it for the connection to the movie, but we did wish it did more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find this very entertaining and fun to play. You can enjoy and not have to think too hard. I consider it light fun and relaxing. Ilike it because it gets you clues if you seem to be stuck.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|As soon as I listened to this, I went and downloaded their other available music.  &#34;One Foot&#34; is my absolute favorite, but I love the entire sound of this album.  It's quickly become my newest go-to music for when I'm going somewhere.
B003DT19F0|5.0|The tinker bell series is well written and is my grand daughters favorite. We watch it over and over and I do not mind.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I thought this was much better than the previous two in the HoO series, mainly because Percy & Annabeth were re-united very quickly.  There are a lot of characters stories who are being told, and it gets hard to follow at times.  Riordan leaves you with a cliff hanger that will leave you wanting more.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love all the dinner dash games and this one is just as good. Great game to play if you need to pass some time.
B009FHRRAA|5.0|what a great album.  Normally I don't buy remasters because I still haven't heard one where the difference in quality was apparent, but this is one of my very favorite albums so I didn't mind.  Besides the great songs, they have included 3 live versions of songs and they're pretty good, in each one they stuck pretty close to the CD version but the recording quality was pretty good.  You will want to play it loud.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Heard a lot about the book so I decided to check it out. I thought the book did a great job covering the game itself but I wish I knew more about Panem and it's origins, leaders, etc. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good adventure read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the story line,  love the characters, love the romance! Can't wait for the movie! Hope they listen to fans and cast James Deen as Christian.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|In spite of what I knew about this movie, it was still a surprise, mostl;y good. The acting was excellent and the story OK. Ted was a great character and the movie had really funny moments.<br />In the end I was hoping for more but not to disappointed with what I got.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the absolute best books I have ever read! Once you start reading....you can't stop. Wish the book could go on & on....sad that it's over!
B008FYZIVY|4.0|great Christmas gift<br />enjoyed the series on tv so got for mother in law for Christmas<br />She has already started watching and loves it
B005NFJAZS|4.0|Love it Great Muscial.  Sure enjoyed Sherly Jones and cast.<br />It is a long musical though I will say, but definately good
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved this book...can't wait to read the next ones :) about to buy them now ans sink my self into my own world all over again.
630522577X|5.0|Have seen it on Broadway and the original Pigmalian<br />Loved this movie.  It is well done, and a great family picture
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Very interesting read. Good character development. The Misremembered Man wins your sympathy and you find yourself rooting for his finding a way to love.  I would definitely recommend
B009YP9L7U|5.0|So intriguing I absolutely love this book. It was so hard to put it down. I do definitely plan to read more by Mira Kelly.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|As a high schooler, I read a book in english class about greek mythology, and I absolutely loved it! And when I saw that they had did a remake of Clash of the titans, I just had to see it! And man was that a mistake, I actually wanted to strangle the popcorn guy. I was a fan of the original masterpiece, but this remake was so bad I was at the verge of crying.<br /><br />Story: The basic story to this film is perseus, the mortal son of Zeus, who is the son of Chronos, is out to battle minions of the underworld and stop them from conquering the world. What I find disappointing is that there is no in depth story. They are mashing events together, and in the end, it turns all out into a mess. The story \\"does not\\" drag, and that's exactly the problem, instead they are rushing everything. The kraken was shown for like 2 minutes. They don't go in depth on the gods themselves. The writing was just bad.<br /><br />Acting: Hammy, mediocre acting by Sam Worthington (Perseus), and I like Sam Worthington don't get me wrong, but I felt he wasn't putting enough effort into the role of Perseus, I felt as if he was just walking through the film, without giving enough emotion. Liam Neeson (Zeus), I think we all love Liam Neeson, but it seemed as if he was overacting in this film. Why he was in this? I will never understand, did he really need the paycheck that badly? Regardless, it wasn't neither of the actors fault, as much as it was the director's and writer's.<br /><br />Effects/Cgi: The cgi was terrible! It was something you'd get on the Syfy channel. Medusa was poorly animated, when Perseus chopped her head off, it was obvious animation. The original Ray Harryhausen masterpiece had stop animation, and I know times have changed, and I don't have a problem with cgi, but atleast make the cgi look good. The kraken didn't look anything like the original kraken, the original kraken looked like a Hydra, this kraken looked like.... whatever the hell that thing was supposed to be. Also, nearly every setting, place, or thing was cgi, no joke.<br /><br />Casting: Almost universally bad casting! I like Sam Worthington, but as perseus? He didn't even have the haircut, or try to hide his australian accent. They couldn't have chose someone better? I'll admit the gods were decently casted, the problem was they didn't act like the gods, they lacked representation from the mythological characters.<br /><br />Verdict: Waste of potential, the writers were not thinking well when they made this script. You can't remake a masterpiece and turn it into garbage. They gave roles to actors who shouldn't have even been in this film, people if you still have yet to see the original, and you haven't seen this version either, please do NOT watch this version first! I actually have people in my high school who think this is better than the original, and that the original looked stupid, I mean normally I would say you are entitled to your own opinion, but this film is so bad. Whatever, you're entitled to your opinion, just please watch the original.nearly every setting, place, or thing was cgi, no joke.<br /><br />Casting: Almost universally bad casting!

B009P5S11G|4.0|I have been a HUGE Rihanna fan for years. I've been obsessed with almost every one of her albums. I was super excited for this one to come out because her past work has been so good. Talk that Talk stayed in my car on repeat for a year. But this album..I probably had about 6 songs that I liked out of the whole thing. Usually I like every single one of the songs on her albums. It seemed to be lacking effort and since she released it a year after her last one...it was just released too fast so I was a little disappointed when I heard this when I am used to a certain level of perfection from her.<br /><br />I gotta say, like I said last year, I'm disgusted Rihanna thinks its attractive to put all these smoking pictures in her album artwork. I feel sad that she will one day ruin such a great voice with something as stupid as smoking. But it's her body and she wants to act like she's invincible, I guess it's her choice. It's a shame though and it's just...ew[...] It's not pleasant, for me at least, to see her one the album art or in music vids blowing clouds of smoke everywhere.  She doesn't care about the message that it sends to younger impressionable fans. Like it or not people look up to her and I know it's their stupid choice but that's the thing. She is encouraging a lot of stupid choices and doesn't care because she wants to do what she wants.<br /><br />Anyway back to the album<br /><br /> My 2 most favorite songs were &#34;What Now&#34; and &#34;Half of me&#34;. Other favorites were &#34;Lost in Paradise&#34;, &#34;Stay&#34;, &#34;Right Now&#34;. I love when she uses her full vocal potential with good music to back it up. She is one of my favorite vocalists and I super loved Good Girl Gone Bad, and Rated R.<br /><br />I love &#34;Diamonds&#34; as a song but felt that it fell short vocals wise.<br /><br />The song with Chris Brown was absolutely just WTF!!! It completely rubs me the wrong way. If they truly didn't want it to be anybody's business then they wouldnot constantly make songs together, talk about it publicly, release public pictures. They disgust me but they can do what they want, nobody is going to stop them.<br /><br />The song she did with Eminem? Eminem was the best part of the song!<br /><br />&#34;Pour it up&#34; and &#34;Jump&#34; have grown on me quite a bit, I did not like them at first but the music is good so the rest just fell into place.<br /><br />&#34;Fresh out the runway&#34; I have a love hate relationship with.<br /><br />The other songs I did not mention were in my opinion weak, unimpressive songs that she could have spent more time on.

0393327345|5.0|If you've read any of Palahniuk's books, you know how brilliant the man is. If you haven't read any of his books, even if you haven't read a book in years, you should pick up Fight Club, it just might make you an avid bookworm. Do yourself a favor and read this book!
1432794426|3.0|Other reviewers have already well documented the factual errors that abound in this book, so I will not go into that again. What I will take issue with though, is the title of this book vs. the actual content of the book. That I am aware of, the most significant crisis in Michael Jackson's adult life, was the trial he faced for the accusations of sexual misconduct with a child. Since the book was titled \\"Defending a King,\\" I had a natural disposition to believe this book would be focused on said trial and might just have new information that would defend the pop star. What I found was a lengthy book full of information that has been previously reported (and misreported,) that had an incomplete view of the trial. Yes, this book appears to be pro Michael Jackson, but I never saw that the author offered any compelling evidence of anything. This book just seemed to be a rehash of previously written books about the King of Pop and his life in general. This wasn't the worst book about Mr. Jackson that I have ever read, but it certainly wasn't the best either. I didn't really see that the author took a firm position of defense on any one subject and just thought it was kind of like a compendium of stuff anyone could find on the internet. There were times when this book was a little like reading a log of events rather than a book and I actually found it quite boring. I really can't recommend this if you are going in to it expecting to read things you haven't already heard and expecting a true defense. I really thought that from someone who has a history in Psychology this book would have a little more substance.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|Heroes 3 is one of the all time best.  I run it on Windows 7 and it does fine.  Hours of play available in the campaigns and the scenarios on the game plus randomly generated games.  being turn based, you can walk away and come back later and resume unlike the real time games that you have to monitor every second.

B004XWLN20|5.0|Need I say more?<br /><br />It's the whole complete series of Smallville. The epic drama of Superman's growing years.<br />Warning, not entirely running in line with Superman comics. So if your Superman comic hardcore fan, don't be an over-critic about it.<br /><br />What's more? Smallville Season 11 is still running! But in comics form, so get yours online, if not, at your nearest comic store.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This movie wasn't worth the hype! It is badly made. It reminded me of a late night crap movie with no plot. This could of been done so much better. With as many of good actors in it you would think that it would of been at least a descent movie to watch. Total waste of time. I expected better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Book, better than the movie, now to start the second one and hope it's just as good as the first

B0041KVW2K|5.0|As a baby boomer , I have had the opportunity to enjoy the Beatles and their body of work as played by the most primitive analog sound equipment and the far more sophisticated digital technology. I was floored with the quality and the completeness of the sound. The fact that the whole recording can be heard(as opposed to the usual cd sanitizing)is truly amazing.<br /><br />Expensive? Yes, but worth every single cent.<br /><br />For me this is the definitive Beatles collection(and I happen to own almost all original LPs too).

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Photos of this watch do not do it justice. Fit and finish on the timepiece appears exceptional. The band is okay. I plan to replace it with a leather strap for a more vintage look. Potential buyers need to understand this is an automatic watch. Requires wearing it for it to work. No battery. If you don't wear the watch daily, it will run down. Which means resetting the time each time you wear it.

B009VLX8FS|3.0|This album is much more pop oriented than her previous country albums.  Disregarding the different feel for the album it shares most of her traditional themes.  The only major problem is a lack of punch.  There are 2 or 3 good songs that deserve to be purchased individually.  The rest are filler.  This is a bit of a letdown from previous albums where more than half of the songs were really GOOD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Enjoyed this book a lot. It's a good, easy read that has you smiling, wondering, crying and happy. It's a good book to read. Get it!!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Watched this loser because the 2 leads are two of my favorite actors. However, should have seen it coming with the teddy bear as the &#34;vehicle&#34; for delivering this ridiculous piece of fluff. Can't believe I watched it to the end. Worst movie ever seen.<br />Sesame Street is better than this. Way better.

0399160450|5.0|Clancy really puts it all together in this one. This is as good as any in the Ryan series during its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s.<br /><br />All the elements are there: High-tech wizardry - and elevated to a new importance, as we see what cyberwarfare can really mean. A major adversary - China, and with real world saber rattling lately, quite timely. The threat of war in that Clancy way, more realistic than the they're-about-to-launch-the-nukes! plots  other thrillers tend towards. This one has instead the amping up of carrier groups as air forces begin to test each other and global leaders feint and parry to try to head things off, plus a dramatic finish that's all you want and more.  It feels much more more real than most thrillers, and that's always been a Clancy hallmark.<br /><br />Jack Ryan Jr.'s character continues to develop. At at this point he's as much fun as his dad was 20 years ago.  He's no longer the inexperienced guy that was a bit of a stretch as a hero a few books ago. There are romantic tensions: his affair with Melanie Kraft deepens.  Readers of the previous installment know Kraft, a CIA agent, has been ordered by the FBI to spy on Jack Jr., but it's a lot more complicated than it seems.<br /><br />There's a great new character in Adam Yao, a resourceful CIA agent operating solo in Hong Kong against the Chinese; I hope they keep him around in future installments. And the old gang are still around - John Clark, Ding Chavez, Mary Pat Foley, et al. Clark is forced into retirement by an injury to, wouldn't you know it, his trigger finger, but the reader will suspect that by book's end he'll have found a way back into the action.<br /><br />Jack Jr. and the private, off-the-shelf spy gang at Hendley Associates, acting against a  Libyan spy cell, discover it was on to them,  and was run by someone with great computer sophistication, global reach and a long arm. Hendley's computer whiz tracks clues back as far as a Chinese hacker, who has disappeared after escaping U.S. prison for security violations.<br /><br />Pulling the strings is the mysterious Center, who communicates  via computer with a global net of agents who have never seen him and know neither his identity nor his nationality. Center expects absolute obedience with ruthless consequences. Center has sprung from jail and forcibly recruited a Russian SVR operative who in the previous book tortured series regular John Clark.<br /><br />Meanwhile the Chinese president, a technocrat who has narrowly survived a coup and now owes the military chief,  must stabilize a plummeting economy. The warlord convinces him moves in the South China Sea, followed by full occupation of Hong Kong and seizure of Taiwan, will yield economic benefits and establish China as the world's pre-eminent force. The warlord, though,  wants to move a lot faster than the president thinks. And he sees the real obstacle is the U.S. president - Jack Ryan Sr., now having won election back to office.<br /><br />Clancy's writing collaboration with Mark Greaney continues to bear fruit. The writing is smoother than Clancy's was. There's less railing against liberals. The book moves faster and is shorter than some of Clancy's heaviest doorstops, while still having that epic length you can get lost in during a cold winter evening. On the other hand, lacking Clancy's ruminations tinted with Irish Catholic morality makes the writing a bit more generic.<br /><br />What's best in this book is the look into cyberwarfare. It's on everyone's mind these days, it's no longer primarily about the hardware, and Clancy details how it might be done, how that world works and its truly stunning reach - both into the lives of individuals, and on the large scale. Clancy suggests strongly the Chinese have used their wealth, technological expertise, espionage and global ambitions to pursue cyberwarfare in a big way. And he shows the vulnerability even of what we tend to think are secure military and intelligence networks. An enemy who can disrupt every civilian and military system you've got, while reading the CIA's email and hacking its computers, is a formidable enemy indeed.em you've got, while reading the CIA's email and hacking its computers, is a formidable enemy indeed.

B009HEMW4W|5.0|I was surprised this movie was so good.  I knew 1 & 2 were good, but usually the 3rd movie in a series isn't as good as the earlier ones.  Watched it twice in one day, once with my parents and once with my kids.
B008I34ZFW|1.0|I thought that this would be an enjoyable, zany juxtaposition of '40s sci fi films and the science fiction life that the world is living today.<br />The movie rolled along in a B movie kind of way until the scene where an African American dude is turned into a white Nazi! I blanched, and kind of got ill (and I have a pretty strong stomach). The movie ended my interest right here. Is it fair for me to make a review without seeing the entire film? Yes, it is unfair. I am saying, however, that once you see something extremely offensive in a film, it kind of kills your interest in continued viewing.<br />But, hey, that's just one cheloveks opinion.
0762408480|4.0|&#34;The Christmas Carol&#34; by Charles Dickens was a good book for advanced readers (grades 5+), but the illustrations were superb! The language was difficult because of its 'old English' stage-speak, but the illustrations were able to captivate the younger audience. I ranked it 4 since I was buying for my 6 yr. old granddaughter who was about to experience &#34;The Christmas Carol&#34; via David Simpich's Marionette Show and I wanted to introduce her to the story. This book was too difficult for her, even as an advanced reader, but she thoroughly enjoyed the Puppet Show with exactly the same language! She will treasure the book because of the memory of the show.
B002PEP4HI|5.0|Truly one of the most inspirational books I have ever read! Thank you Mitch Albom. You're writing is truly amazing.
0316228532|5.0|I absolutely loved this superb  &#34;first novel for adults&#34; by J.K. Rowling! I hesitated to purchase &#34;A Casual Vacancy&#34; because of the numerous negative reader reviews (although there are also many positive reader reviews) here on Amazon.com.  I'm so very glad that I didn't allow the negative reader reviews to influence me too much!  Perhaps some of the negative reviews were from readers who were hoping for more fantasy novels or for more writing intended for juveniles from Ms. Rowling. Regardless, I'm delighted that Ms. Rowling has put her excellent writing talents to work on serious adult fiction, and I hope she writes many more adult novels! Her writing skills are superior, her characters seem real (faults and all), and the plot is very well-developed, if disturbing (realistically so) at times. I highly recommend this novel to readers who enjoy quality literary fiction.
B0056BU3I2|4.0|Plenty of extras.  Without a doubt this is the best Fast and Furious movie so far.  Great HD and sound quality.

B008X8P8A8|5.0|total war battles is quite fun but fell just short of my expectation, I mean why couldn't they have added a simple mechanic that lets you turn your troops around? other than that the games quite fun having three gamemodes campaign skirmish and multiplayer. the campaign is simple and linear but does provide some challenge, I in truth consider this an unneeded side mode. the next two I find my self playing more often. skirmish is you trying to kill the other teams general while protecting your own, this even on normal gave me trouble which is why I love it. multiplayer allows you to play against other players so of course its fun as players are usually smarter than the Ai. the gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to learn, this is where campaign has value as it teaches you what you need to know. Total War Battles easily earns 5 stars from me. Having one mistake you can see why I like it.
B009KUANWG|5.0|Out of all of the Bond songs featuring Daniel Craig, this is the best one. Good composition and instrumentation, and of course Adele sounds amazing

B0076DCT2G|5.0|As a fan of both John Corey and Paul Brenner, this was a fantastic read. Fast moving interesting plot line a number of twists and turns and enough character development to make all of the players interesting. My only complaint, the story ended 100 pages too soon. Would really have liked to understand how the survivors got home and what they faced when they got there. Perhaps the making of a sequel?
B009H442DG|4.0|This CD is lovely. It was perfect to have on while wrapping gifts and making Christmas Eve dinner. Worth the money!
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|May 8, 2102:  Since the time I originally posted some comments on this superb documentary essay, \\"The Story of Film: An Odyssey,\\" I have re-watched all 15 hours of it twice. Several of my friends are cinephiles and college film professors who have been anxious to share this viewing experience with me. This explains my insanity, as it were. Lots of nice dinners at my house and lots of \\"The Story of Film.\\" Needless to say, everybody I know finds something missing: an important director, an important individual film. Everybody hates something that Cousins loves. (He is is full of hyperbolic praise for the most surprising things.) But we all agree -- this is a stunning achievement. One of the greatest things about it, by the way, is that it makes you want to see hundreds of movies again or for the first time. If I had the energy, I would remove almost all the negative remarks I have made below -- but best to leave it as it stands. I do have to add, however, not one of my friends has any objection to the way Mr. Cousins speaks. I also no longer find that his remarks interfere with the zillion film clips. Just imagine the mountainous task of selecting and obtaining the rights to them!<br /><br />Earlier review: This huge \\"The Story of Film: An Odyssey\\" is an odyssey for sure in the way the author/narrator's ideas stray all over the place intellectually and geographically. But it is coherent unlike Godard's \\"Histoire(s) du cin&eacute;ma.\\" It is also highly idiosyncratic and the author's opinions are right in your face. He makes sweeping pronouncements on who and what is great. One is likely to disagree with many of his powerful convictions.<br /><br />Here at Amazon, I have read a number of unfair negative customer comments. Many people cannot stand Mark Cousins' Northern Irish accent -- a nasty prejudice I find offensive. It is true that his speech is lilting, even lulling, and virtually every statement sounds like a question; but would these same commentators attack speakers with other national or ethnic accents? And how seriously are we to take comments from people who have seen only two or three hours out of a 15-hour project?<br /><br />This is not a set to buy if you are seeking a wonderful series on the \\"Golden History of Hollywood.\\" Cousins does not ignore Hollywood altogether, of course (how could he?) -- but the glamorous studio years are shoved way, way off to the side. Except in one episode, Cousins makes references to Hollywood only as needed. When he reaches the '60s and '70s, American film comes more solidly into the picture. In general, Cousins admires almost all of the American based directors that European intellectuals fashionably admit into the Pantheon of greatness (Sirk, Wilder, Ray, Minnelli, Donen, Hitchcock, Ford, Lynch etc.). In this way he is predictably tiresome, and one even suspects an anti-American sentiment lurking beneath the surface of everything. Certainly the many full-color inserted shots of LA seem designed to make it look as tacky as possible.<br /><br />So -- for a documentary that calls itself \\"The Story of Film,\\" it is lousy as a study of American film per se. But Cousin's brief comments on everything he treats are of interest. He offers one insight after another, and his explanations of technical developments would be perfect for film students. He is always discussing lighting, atmosphere, mise en scene, camera angles, camera lenses, and everything that has to do with content and meaning of a visual image. His comments on the advent of digital and CGI techniques are especially good. The viewer is likely to have a series of epiphanies.<br /><br />India, China, Egypt, Japan, South America, Mexico, Spain, France, Denmark, Sweden, England, Hungary, Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia,  -- these and more give a sweep to his narrative. I learned about many films I have never heard of before in my life and now am anxious to see.<br /><br />The film intercuts contemporary documentary footage (apparentlyfreshly shot for the documentary itself) of all the international locales discussed, often showing us a brief glimpse of the way something looks now. For instance, in a the section about Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, there are flashes of the locations today. For instance, Chaplin is on a street corner with the blind girl in \\"City Lights,\\" and for a second or two we see that empty corner as it looks now -- namely dreary!. We learn about the Shaw Studios in China -- and then see those studios today etc. A technique Cousins uses is to intercut examples of the later influence of a an earlier director on the work of a later one. So, when we learn about Chaplin, we see examples of his influence on other comic actors and filmmakers.<br /><br />One slightly annoying thing is that Cousins often talks his way through many of the film clips. I think it helps to know something about movies to start with -- but this essay (I think that is a better term than \\"documentary\\") is bound to broaden the horizons of any serious film lover.

B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I am a big fan of Lee Childs  Jack Reacher books,  This movie does a great job of showing the fascinating way that Reacher figures clues.  Also the fight sequences are great. Who cares if Tom Cruise is shorter,  he does a great job !  I loved the movie and will buy it,  and you know what,  no sequences to be used in Video games !  yay.Susan R.
B0030B624E|5.0|If you are a zombie movie fan and have not seen this movie, you are missing out. Great satire with an excellent mix of characters. Must see.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This was a great purchase.  I bought one for myself and one for my brother for Christmas.  I took my cousin out and had this cd playing in my car.  When she heard it she said she wanted this cd so I bought one for her too.  I always loved Rod Stewarts music.  This Christmas cd is GREAT.  VERY HAPPY I PURCHASED THIS.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B002NZV68U|4.0|I wouldn't watch this movie without my son, but if you are going to watch a children's movie, this is a good one. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and really makes this movie. It is different from the original plot in many ways, but also has many scenes that are from the original movie. If you haven't seen it, and you have a 5+ child, you should watch it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I like the game. The makers took care to see that the levels were different and the game did not get dull.  I enjoy building with the goo and trying to save many balls as I can.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I understand that it has some negative dialog that you as a parent may not approve of, but I don't think it goes way off the reservation, and my son can acknowledge things in the book that are not appropriate. He reads this regularly at 7, which is a trick. So, I say if you can keep your seven year old boy reading, that is 5 starts.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|If you get apps from Google Play, you could wipe your phone, change devices, and still be able to redownload your app. Amazon Market will not let you redownload the app once your phone crashes and apps you bought can only be  used on that one device.<br /><br />It's a better deal to buy apps through Google Play because of this.<br /><br />This Office Suite Pro 6 app works okay, so I have no complaints on this end. My phone is kind of old, so the app takes a while to open. I have a Samsung Galaxy S 4G. Speaking of which, SGS4G is a terrible phone that everyone should stay away from.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Arena style gameplay similar to Gun Bros or Eternity Warriors (not a Diablo style dungeon crawler like the previous games) . Freemium model but not as bad as Glu games; game can be enjoyed without spending money. This game begs to be a dungeon crawler and only makes me wish I was still playing Dungeon Hunter 2 (which is incompatible with my Kindle Fire for some odd reason).
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I love this book, and it's really my favorite story of all time. Mr. Darcy is just about as dreamy as they come. I've read this book at least 6 times since I was 10, and that's not including all the film adaptations and mangas I watched and read on this. It's well worth the read. The Notebook has nothing on this!
0515141429|4.0|Jack shrugged, Roscoe shrugged, Finley shrugged, Hubble shrugged, Charlie shrugged. Everyone shrugged. A great book but you'd think an Editor might have caught the severe overuse of the word \\"shrugged\\".
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I almost didn't watch this movie because there's that stupid teddy bear in the whole film, but it's by Seth McFarlen who voiced Ted himself, and my friends loved it, so I gave it a chance. It's a pretty good movie. The teddy bear is totally believable, and while the movie gets sad in some parts of it, there are comedic lines inserted throughout, so it's still a light hearted film.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan did not disappoint me; she is brilliant.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves music. Susan has a beautiful voice.
B0086213XW|1.0|This was probably the worst movie that I have ever watched all of the way through. It was 1 1/2 hours of my life that I will never get back. i kept thinking that maybe it would get better, but it never did. It was just plain stupid! I never usually write reviews for movies, but I just had to warn someone that may see this. Don't waste your time. Really crazy movie. I'm not offended by nudity, but I also think that people should be warned that there are several scenes with complete nudity.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good book, totally a guilty pleasure! If you're looking for world-class writing or wordplay, you've come to the wrong place. If you just want someone fun to read that will draw you in -- this is it!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Awesome legos for girls--pretty colors that are not found in a typical lego box--she loves them and has a book with several choices of things to make or create something on her own.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I actually didn't read this edition but each story individually . I usually read paranormal and horror but I like to read scifi now and then if its good and this sounded really interesting and had such rave reviews so thought I'd give it a try.  I got wool 1 as a free ebook and that was it, I was so happy to see there was more after that and I read them all within a week, I hope he writes more and from looking at his blog there are more in the works! yeah!  I thought the books were fast paced the story was really wonderful and yea you might have to not wonder how some things could work for so long but hey I guess its possible you just never know.  I like the writing and world building whats left of the world that is, lol I don't think you will be sorry you read this. go see if wool 1 is still free and if it is get it, read it then come back for the omnibus edition you won't be sorry, its an exciting story and makes you think about a lot of things and makes you really happy we don't have to live like this and hope something like this never happens. I don't think I could think up something like this and give the author kudos for his imagination and thanks for writing it..more I want more!
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Think of Diana Krall, and think of the great American Songbook. The standards, and the wonderful melodies and lyrics that embody the best music, performed by the very best performers. Diana Krall certainly emodies all of that in just about all she does. This latest release is a slight departure for Ms Krall, in that she edges back a little prior to her envelope and delivers some performances of songs from an earlier era. There are times she makes you feel like you're in a speakeasy, or a vaudeville house listening to the wistful stylings of a ragtime band, and I surely felt echoes of roots jazz and blues music. For as wonderful a singer and vocal stylist as she is, Diana Krall is certainly on top of her game as a jazz pianist. Her name bears mention in the most august of company. She plays like someone who has paid her dues. In this effort, however, we get a little more of a taste of the guitar. For many who expect the same thing every time from this artist, guess what? She's exploring and reaching as far out as it can go. All in all, certainly a departure, and we look forward to Ms Krall doing what she does most, but I think this one stands well with the standards. When you look at a body of work such as Diana Krall's, you take a snapshot here and there, and you find there are delightful moments captured that certainly don't represent the entirety, but represent a moment in time. That's what is cool about a complete artist. The ones who don't explore should bore you on some level, eh?
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I enjoyed Season one, so I gave Season 2 a try.  I didn't enjoy it as much, surprisingly, which is why I gave it only four stars.  It was good and very consistent with the first season.  The characters never felt as if they grew from season one to me, though.  They just seemed to grind down deeper into their personalities, which felt a little grating and whiny, in my opinion.  The plot lines had promise, but fell short of what they could have been.  It's worth watching if you like season one.  If you're a pure romantic that enjoys characters who embellish existing personalities rather than grow dimensionally (Twilight comes to mind here), then you should love this season.  If you want to explore different facets of a character, then you'll still enjoy this, but might come away with a slight feeling of dissatisfaction as I have.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Bosch is back!<br />Excellent<br />Same methodical manner , which combined with the infamous hunch ,  always gets his man/woman.<br />Book him Danno
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Though the special effects are undeniably better than in the original movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger(the Impregenator), the characters are not as likable and the storyline not as engaging.  It's a mediocre movie, at best.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|very descriptive. i could feel all the pain he was going through it was written so wellthe story made me wish i could have helped him trow his torment
B0063GORYU|5.0|this a great app! I love everything about it! I have never had any problems with this app! Love it!!!!!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|this book helped me decide weather i was an introvert or extrovert and i appreciate that part of the book very much. the book was also written well
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. It's one of my favorites. I would recommend this to my friends and family. You feel like it's you actually doing it yourself.
B00333NCTM|5.0|A surprise find at the library one day and it turned out to be a page-turner! I especially enjoyed that the language was basically Ozzy speaking; brilliant!(i.e. \\"dodgy bird\\", etc.) Great insight into the history/beginnings of Black Sabbath. I couldn't finish the book fast enough; immediately bought a copy for a dear friend who is one of the biggest Black Sabbath/Ozzy fans ever.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|He has a great voice and sang so many great songs that I love!<br />I played it over and over!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book I  very relatable for everyone at one point or another. It gets through to anyone who reads it , and I  impossible to put down .<br /><br />This is not only my favorite book because it was the last one I read , but because it was one of the few that really made we realize how I felt.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids enjoy the Angry Birds games. I like that they have to think and strategize about the best way to win and get the most points and stars upon completion of each level or puzzle.
B00846REIS|4.0|I wish they would not argue so much.but a good book overall,I'm going to read the next one also now
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is worth the money. It is a good, safe game for kids to play that utilizes their imagination to build things and create things with certain &#34;materials&#34;. My kids LOVE this game...and I always like to see what they came up with when they finish. Sometimes they have to &#34;think outside of the box&#34; to come up with a design for something with the materials available to them. While at a restaurant today, my son created a restaurant on the game! If you or your child likes Legos, building, or gaming requiring imagination and creativity, then you will love this game!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Simply couldn't put it down!<br />Amazing love story that makes your heart thirst for more!! Can't wait to buy the next two in the series!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story touched my heart in more ways than one. I felt a true bond with Sky and Holder. My assumptions prior to reading on from chapter to chapter were merely subtle reminders that we as humans fail to look closer at times. Holder is a boy that every girl deserves to have by her side. Sky is a girl that everyone deserves as a friend. This was the first book I've read with my new Kindle Fire, and I finished it that same day! Well done, Colleen!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy the different levels and the colors are easy to follow.  I really enjoy playing this game. Flow Free is a game for all ages.
B00632HWOG|1.0|22 permissions now with the upgrade? No thanks! I'm uninstalling now. I do like the Permission Dog app that alerted me.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Went in thinking teen romance ended up being a very good book with lots of surprises. ... . . .
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is the first novel I have enjoyed in a long time. It drew me into the adventure and is a unique storyline.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|went on easy looked good but sounds like u r under water or in a tunnel if we have done something wrong or u can tell us how to stop that i can rate higher and it would be greatly appreciated
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Lots of little pieces so I would not buy for young children.  Melissa & Doug products are quality toys & this did not disappoint.  The girl I bought it for, loved it.  Hours of play.
B00A8Z6KN8|4.0|I love this type of music and I'm glad i bought it. Unfortely I haven't seen the movie yet though.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Fun game for entire family.  Does not take long to play but teaches strategy.  Quality is good & colorful pieces.  I'm not into games much but really liked this one.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Great movie! also came in on time, which I was very pleased with! Will definitely be buying from again! Thanks!
B009GED3HS|5.0|dary!  I highly recommend this show!  It is witty, funny, and a little romantic.  It has everything to appeal to both sexes.  This show is awesome and so is the cast! I hope they do a season 9!  It will be sad to see this show go!
B00003CX8N|4.0|Another wonderful story that takes you away to another time.  Have also lent this one out to friends who enjoyed as much as I did.  A Mel Brooks film!
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|The guy is pits. In the end, he gets better, but still not a family movie.  Im would consider it for good acting.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game!! it was one of the longer games that's out there.  it had a good story line and it kept you wanting to learn more!!  more like this game please!!
B007FJFDXS|4.0|The game is ok but only managed to keep me interested for a few minutes. After about 10 minutes I got bored of playing this game. Doesn't mean it isn't fun... the levels just aren't challenging enough.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app is on the same level with Docs to Go.  Creating a new document is easier and the tools are accessible.  Give this app a try,  you will not be disappointed.
B007N85POS|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is really fun to play. After watching the movie I just couldn't help myself. I had to buy this game for my Fire HD. I find it more fun then the original, and I really like the Rio theme.
B008GOG98Y|5.0|A wonderful coming-of-age movie featuring a very young Dennis Quade. This movie hits all of the high and low notes in examining the bonds of friendship, their strengths and weakness, and explores the tension between local townspeople versus their collegiate counterparts. The dialogue is first rate and supports a credible story line to the very last moment.<br /><br />&#34;Breaking Away&#34; is a clear winner!!!
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|Rocket music player is ok but not a good replacement for the Kindle Fire HD's music player. Each time you connect headphones the music starts playing by itself which can be good sometimes but very annoying others. Plus to get the equaliser you have to pay so not really worth switching from the standard kindle player to this one. But bad though.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I'm not a big reader but I couldn't put this book down. I am a major gamer though and where games are concerned this book hits on all points. Fans of classic video games, table-top RPG'S, and 80's nostalgia take notice because this book is an epic adventure written by and for the proudly nerdy among us.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|I watched this film on Netflix streaming.  Great dialog, awesome trolls and good camera work.  Should become a classic.  Very dark and suspenseful.  The trolls look like huge versions of those in &#34;Dark Crystal&#34;. One of my favorites. . Don't miss this one.  It's like being in a Grimm's fairy tale.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is really fun! I play it all the time. you don't have to buy much to have fun with Iyar.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this is such an addicting game! lots of fun and definitely worth a download! the ads are a little bit annoying...but they are really not that bad.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|It seems that all reproduction Hendrix vinyls are on 180 gram vinyl, even if some don't specifically say they do. Even if this isn't 180, it is still really thick and should last a LONG time. Well worth the purchase.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Great action flick, if you like action movies this is one you ought to buy, super,excellent actors and locals. Thanks
B000057DON|5.0|When I first recieved the album I thought it was some cheap knockoff because the cover looks A LOT different than the one pictured. Do not fret though, as the other art is correct for the vinyl. If you wish to see what it looks like search, appetite for destruction vinyl. Believe me, it will save you the small heart attack you may have. Oh, and the vinyl is high quality, relatively thick and manages to fit on one record. The dust cover has plenty of room both for the vinyl and to fit in the case itself.
0061537969|5.0|Incredible story about life, love, truths, and of course, Enzo, who gives us the language of dogs. Or more like, this dog! That will make sense when you read it. If you imagine your pets' voice and choice commentary, as I so often do, you must read this book. Enjoy, and learn! Thank you Garth! I so appreciated the racing lessons too!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|it was great and very intertaining would be good tor all ages. it keeps them interested for a long timr.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very entertaining, fast read. Spicy but at the same time romantic. Non-stressed pastime. Easy to read at the end of a busy day at work.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|GRR Martin continues to weave a masterpiece, with the same intrigue and action as in the previous books. My only complaint is the book left me wanting more!!
B00A7ZX37A|5.0|She is so talented great beats, rhythms etc. without it being so muddled up with all the bad language. This edited version just removed the language without adding a bleep, zip, squak etc. Just great music and her voice.
B00006AW63|1.0|I ordered this movie for my granddaughter and it wouldn't work in any of their VCR's or on the computer. After contacting Movie Mars I found there were different movies for different locations. If that had been made clear to me I never would have ordered from them. Now, I'm having trouble getting my refund because I can't find how to print my RAF. I'm extremely disappointed.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Nice I loved reading this book and you should really really really really really really really buy this book really
B002JVWQSW|5.0|my friend never watched the show<br />loves the dvd and know understands<br />everything I was telling her about the<br />show.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This was a gift to my grandson who loves it and his father,my son,loves it just as much. Keeping up the Disney legacy.
0446530573|5.0|I love this book, I used it for my Christmas Dinner, the recipes are clear<br />but it helps if you already know how to cook.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyrd this film.  It is quirky and masterful. Lasse Halstrom turns a simple story into a most enjoyable film.  Don't miss it.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|the first one I gifted December 12/2011 and it recieved<br />rave reviews.  The second one I gifted  this Christmas and<br />the reviews have not come in as yet.  If you like Sinatra you<br />like Buble
B002ZG97LK|5.0|very please. It was a Christmas gift. They where very happy with it.  They really Love James Patterson. So I was very Happy
0312427646|1.0|Quality of this book is VERY poor. Unable to be used as a gift.<br />It's a great little novella that I have read already. Recommend the story but not the Amazon book purchase.
B007EECSFA|4.0|suspenseful, hard to put down. have read other kate morton books and knew that I would like &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34;
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|Was a lot of action and chasing, but didn't seem to have a real plot line, though was carrying on from the prior films.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellent read, it will keep you guessing until the very end.<br />You won't want to put it down, very exciting.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is the best tool for keeping track of life. Better than Facebook even because it is private. The only thing I would like is be able tell see the full year calendar or 3 months at a time.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Wonderful first hand book about an amazing warrior who never gave up and stayed true to Navy Seal bravado. Loved the book highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've never read anything by this author, but this title remained at the top of the best-seller list, so I decided to give it a try. It was a really good story.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|gives me a chance to decompress in a silly way.  Love the complaining and cheering they do when each level is either won or lost.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Everything about this book was amazing. I was so upset when it ended and was going there was more. I never want this trilogy to end!
B0019M06JS|3.0|Eliane has a wonderful voice, however, the two or three songs that I like on her CD have fallen out of favor.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down!! Author made you feel like you were actually there, very exciting.<br />I will definitely be reading the other books and soon!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks' books and this one was amazing. The suspense, curiosity, and desire to keep reading this book was amazing!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is a book about a manuscript but also a book about books. How books were created, how materials were used, why so many great works from the ancient greeks and romans disappeared, how difficult it was to get a book. Also about how the Middle Ages, at the same time that kept some of the classics, through the scribes who copied them, almost destroyed the few remaing classics, considering them heretics.<br />I recomend this book to anyone who loves books, the Renascense and Middle Ages.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|in the game you builb up your army and.  I really like that it is a very fun game it is awsome
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|For kids, this was an enjoyable movie filled with funny one-liners, the obligatory passing gas at inopportune moments, a goofy story, and the heroine wins out at the end of the day.  This is a little different than the stereotypical Pixar movie as some adults will enjoy it, but more will probably suffer through it on behalf of their children.  All in all, this was an entertaining movie for the kids who were laughing throughout the movie.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A humorous and very well written book but the ending is a bit thin. I would still recommend this read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I believe this is the fastest I've ever read a book.  It was that good I needed to know what happens next.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I missed this season when it began, caught it on TNT reruns.  I was happy to find that I could purchase the previous seasons, and will continute to watch the others.  Great product!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|But really sad, don't know if I'll read it again. But I am glad to have the privilege. You won't regret it
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I have watched this complete season, and this series is great!  I look forward to continuing to watch.  The product is exactly as described.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good story. Happy ending. Easy to read. I cant wait to see the movie! Plot is interesting and the love between them is very evident.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Another layer in the Borne cake, and a fairly tasty one, IMO.  I've never been a big Renner fan, but I liked him in this. I've always liked Rachel Weisz and like her here as well.  This is my second favorite of the series, after the original. I liked ending, which mirrors, to a degree, the end of the first of the series. I've read several critiques of the film, but don't agree with most of the complaints. Perhaps I'm too easily pleased, but, hey, it's only a movie.
B003J7HONW|5.0|Love Inna! Very hard to find her album's in Australia so this is the perfect place to get them all.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|As Jesse Stone, Tom Selleck is the perfect police chief.  His weaknesses and his strong sense of justice are tempered by his caring about the ordinary people who never get justice from the system.
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I just wanted to gag throughout the first quarter of the book.  Never made it past her trip to Italy.  Did you ever just want to punch a character in the face?  That is how I felt with every turn of the page.  Then to find out this wasn't her taking a risk in life by going on a journey of self discovery, she was sponsored by a publisher to find herself - in other words, get paid to &#34;experience&#34; crap that you can twist into a plot and sell to the ugly masses.  Shame on me for being a consumer and buying the hype.  Refused to watch the movie, even when it was free on a plane because I was still upset with wasted my money on the book.
B000OVLINI|5.0|What a page turner! Once I started it I could hardly stop reading. It is a very exciting read and wonderfully written.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I wanted to like this video; however, I did not.  Nothing new. Lackluster performances. Predictable. (Except for the VERY DISGUSTING \\"outburst\\" from the Bella group's first performance.)
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My kids really seem to like it. It is the same old same though...just Star Wars... See how long it will last.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a good work out for my brain. The earlier levels are really more of a warm up but from the 7x7 up it can be a bit challenging. I try to get a perfect score on every puzzle before moving on to the next one. All that being said however, it's still a fun game that I don't mind spending time playing just for fun.
B0054N73EY|5.0|If you are a Chili-Peps fan - well worth the purchase.<br />Many songs that won't get radio play but for true fans<br />are GREAT !!!!  It takes my 'ear' 3 plays thru to adjust<br />to any new CD - by 3rd play I was HOOKED !!!<br />BUt I don't understand the cover... odd & a little yuk
0307387178|5.0|This book was very interesting and well written. It really touched my heart. Another excellent book by Jon Krakauer. And much better than the movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kid's even can play and is fun competition for the whole family. Even good for child sitting. I like the special deals for getting new games.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I loved it.  I really enjoyed the Mistborn series but with Stormlight Brandon is showing a true mastery with world building.  Like any book with 1000 pages, there was a short point where you want a couple of characters to take action, but everything comes together and leaves you sad that you might have to wait awhile for the next installment.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|Item arrived quickly, my 13 and 10 yr old grandsons loved it<br />Would recommend for kids 10+.  Box rates at 14+
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but Tina Fey makes it easy. I enjoy her style and her adventures. Many giggles.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|These Winter Village sets are wonderful.  Grand daughters love the winter village pieces.<br />hope you keep coming out with more!  Then I can keep adding to their collection!
1451695187|3.0|Interesting read, however as much as the author attempted to describe his experience, I didn't think it quite cut it. I guess this book didn't answer all my questions as I had hoped in terms of the big bang theory, etc. From a medical perspective though, I do think it proved there is potentially a life after death.
1423113497|5.0|My daughter purchased this set for a friend's birthday, and her friend read them within weeks, and now handed them over to my daughter to read....she's done, and now my older daughter is reading them, and cannot put them down.  Guess I need to read them too.  I was guaranteed through a trusted friend of mine that the books are age appropriate for 9 and up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book touched my heart. I have never in my life Sat down and read an entire novel in one day... until this. The pace was perfect. The end was perfect. There was mystery with a little suspend and of course a love story that isn't too far fetched.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This was a gift to my wife and myself, and we both absolutely love it!  Rod Stewart is one of our favorites, and he really brings the holidays to life!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was s good book<br />Really interesting<br />Not many pages as I read<br />I really liked this really cool book
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|I'm actually extremely disappointed with this product. I love the music in it - don't get me wrong, and I thought the musical was phenomenal - but there are whole tracks missing, (Like the \\"Look Down\\" reprise with Gavroche's opening), and parts of other tracks just cut out (See the Seyfried's beginning bit to \\"A Heart Full of Love\\"). I didn't expect to be able to sit down and listen to the whole movie, despite how the vast majority of it was sung, but I expected a little more out of it. but Really just a disappointment for me.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Wow, I really thought that I would not like this game because of the pics it got above, which made the graphics look poor. But once I played,I<br /> realized how fun and cool it is. Also beautiful graphics
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was a really good book, I have read it multiple times and I haven't gotten tired of it yet.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Movie was okay.  But hard to follow plot as the sound jumped up and down.  Could not always make out what the characters said.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Good effects.  Nice action.  Sound was sometimes difficult to adjust.  Kept my interest. Would like to see sequel movies made from the book series.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this for my brother who was happy about getting them.  The biggest thing about this purchase is the actual transaction.  I got it as a lightning deal and was happy until I saw that the price had dropped by $5 later in the day.  I tried to cancel it so I could re-order at the lower price but was unable to do so.  I wrote to Amazon asking to get reimbursed for the $5 which they did.  Normally if I missed a deal I would chalk it up to bad timing but this was aggravating since the price drop was only a couple hours later.  This was going to be the &#34;make it or break it&#34; deal for me regarding my prime membership and I'm happy to say Amazon came through.  They handled it professionally and 100% to my satisfaction.<br /><br />As far as the movies go, the Alien movies are great and I look forward to seeing them in Blu-ray at my brother's house!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds is one of the best and fun games ever designed for smart phones. Rovio has done an amazing job making quality games. Even though there are a lot of different angry birds games now, the original one is still the best! Must have!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|An awesome puzzle game with great graphics and interesting yet challenging level designs. Runs great on my Nexus 4! World of Goo is well worth it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|So much more than just a batman movie... goes deeper into the story and it is fantastic. Tha characters/actors are great and the story all goes together. Bane is a great villian and the part is played well.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I had shied away from this game simply because I hadn't seen any screenshots until recently, so was uninterested in trying it.  I can say I love it!  In my opinion, it is better than Angry Birds.  In Bad Piggies, you build vehicles from parts supplied to you in order to get the piggy to the end goal, bonuses, etc.  For example, you may be given two sets of wooden wheels, three wooden boxes, a small single wheel, two soda bottles (for thrust), and an umbrella...and of course, a piggy!  You put the objects together in any design you would like, and send it off.  It may crash, flip over,  or any variety of mishaps, or you may reach your goal.  Try it, I bet you will not be disappointed.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was given away as a Christmas gift.  The person really liked the movie so this was a good purchase.
B004G600A4|5.0|Just love this movie (even as an adult).  Love Maximus the most.  Was given as a gift and person really liked it.
0393057658|5.0|recepient used for information on radio show.  This popular show is heard in the Caribbean.  Continues to search for information
B0064X7FVE|4.0|easy to use, so far I think the radar could be better. Otherwise I like this application to keep up on the weather.
1932100660|5.0|Read it, and think about it, and then make your own mind whether you would follow the adivces as suggensted iin the book.  It may save your life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There is something for everyone in this game. I've had it for over a year on my phone and still play it
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I got this app for my Kindle Fire and the news feed would not load. I tried refreshing the page several times and restarting the Kindle and it made no difference. Don't waste your time, just use your browser.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|what's the point of collecting coins and byeing stuff. but all ur doing is runing from peaple and trying to not get hit by things.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Its so dumb its funny funniest movie ive seen and its from 1975 at that so its old and awesome i got it for 5 bucks cant beat that(:
B009329Y30|4.0|I read this book and really liked it.  It's hard to fit into a movie all that is contained in the book.  The movie was somewhat lacking, but overall, I enjoyed it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a cool game and is a little bit of an old game<br /><br />I like it but it is a little bit of an old game
0767817664|5.0|I just wish they paired it with Part 2.  I really would like to get my hands on that.  Didn't get that for Christmas this year.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is Addicting. Once you play it, you won't want to stop. Make sure you have time to play.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|My  daughter loves the doll.  It was a perfect addition to her other Monster High collection.  Will add more soon.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|King of entertainment baby!!!!!!!!! this boxset contains a lot of material, not only the original album, love the booksets, kickass concert, couple of great remixes and impresibe unreleased material, a true fan can´t miss this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this from start to finish in two days. Interesting scenario with well developed characters. Even got a real kick out of the author's q & a at the end.
B004JVXTL8|2.0|It really looks like a B movie.  They don't make Halloween, scary movies like the used to.  I wanted more dialogue, and better photography.
B009329Y30|3.0|It was okay.  I really like Zac Effron.  I didn't think the chemistry was genuine.  I think the story had more potential.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I watched this, and it was okay.  The traditional story is loosely within the overall plot.  I didn't get a sense of any emotion between the hero and heroine.  The standout character is the Cherise Theron.
B003204MQS|3.0|I have seen three of the PA movies.  I think this is the best one.  The second is a repeat of the first, and I hardly remember the third one.
B00ARAO1LC|5.0|Creepy, vicious...unlike anything you've seen unless you've seen some pretty insane stuff. If this movie doesn't disturb you or feels too familiar, we should party together.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Look out they are in space and crazier than ever!  This is birds on steroids and big time fun for kids.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|More fun now that it's on the kindle!  Fun version, nothing like the original to have some good fun with birds!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Our kids love this version!  So many different scenes, really funny version.  Our kids crack up at this seasons version.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|One of the best free games and better than some you pay for.<br />Would definitely recommend games by this company
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I already had an app similar to this one.This is good overall but I found other apps that were more efficient with what I am doing.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|very formulaic and not very funny.  Disappointed because I like Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and Seth Macfarlane.  Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you like Wes Anderson's work, then you won't be disappointed with this film.  Quirky and excellent.  We loved it.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Kind of predictable juvenile humor. Would not recommend for family viewing. My teenage son and husband thought it was hilarious.
B0099116AY|5.0|With such a terrific cast, it could only be terrific; therefore, I deem it a wwonderful BluRay smash hit!  There were more than ten words stated at &#34;smash hit&#34;, yet &#34;one more word&#34; was required.  No more reviews!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele. This was bought as a gift because I already owned my copy of it.  It's a great album because all the songs are good to great unkind some artists where only a few songs are worth listening to.
1846144132|5.0|Great book for those hard to buy for people.  It is great to read and easy to pick up and read in short sections. My sister has her's sitting on the coffee table in her den.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Simply could not put it down. In one passage Maddie talks about being sad when a book ends. I know how she feels. I loved every minute of it and was really sorry to see it end.<br /><br />Like some other reviewers I have read all the Bosch novels and was really disappointed in The Drop but The Black Box was classic old school Bosch. A really good read. I am over the love interest though- she is not the least bit interesting but Maddie shows great promise as a character. Looking forward to the next book.
B009GRMH7C|1.0|This is the cheesiest movie I have seen since watching Megashark vs Giant Octopus. Only difference between the two movies would have to be the budget. Acting and plot were comparable.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I laughed & I cryed and both was a good thing I have recomended this to every I know. Our book club is reading this one and I know  everone will enjoy it
B0096BIENY|4.0|What could be better, of its genre?  Makes a really nice gift for those of us who admire and enjoy this group and this music.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very great , love this book .....I would also the other books. Fell in love with Ana and Christian .
B00AMBH70S|4.0|loved the integration from the first 3 with this movie!  The scenery of the film as well as setup was great
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Ordered for my daughter for Christmas. It looked nothing like a friends. Called manufacture gave upc code. Manufacture said its a fake.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game suits anyone wanting to fight,build,or just play with friends.This is worth the $6.99 I give it a 5 stars it ROCKS!!!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|good movie, entertaining as Clint Eastwood can always be<br />lighthearted, & somewhat predictable though<br />streaming quality was good as well
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great as a straightforward alarm clock.  It's easy to figure out and simple to use. It has several useful features:  1) You can display your local weather icon.  2) It has a sleep timer that plays white noise or your music.  3) There is a basic selection of alarm sounds to wake up to.  Everything you need to quickly and easily set an alarm is right there. Great job!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but found the political.message a bit heavy-handed and simplistic, and the child murder disturbing. I'm not sure I would have permitted my daughter to read this had I known beforehand.
0446605409|5.0|John Corey is an exciting character and the author keeps the action moving.  Great beginning of Many John Corey Novels.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Another excellent read with multiple story plots and new characters.  Couldn't put the Kindle down.  Love the open-ended story thread which in addition to the new characters should lead to several future stories in the Agent Pendergast series.
B005LAII12|1.0|I like Wahlberg & MacFarlane and Mila is smoking hot, but none of them could have saved this piece of crap.  What a waste of time and money.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is one of the first books that I got for my kindle.  I loved the book much better than the movie!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I like this app better than two other word processing-type apps I have tried.<br />If this product allowed more than one file to be opened at one time and if it allowed for easier cutting & pasting of content from one doc to another, I would consider giving it 5 stars.  Thanks.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It is a shame that Prime does not use the regular mail system.  I purchased this movie for my 85 year old uncle who can not get to the door to meet Fed Ex or UPS.  So this time I had the movie sent to me and I plan to resend it out, at the cost of $5.00 to me.<br />I have to say in Amazon's defense that Fed Ex tried to deliver it to me, while I was home, no note, nor no redelivery attempt.<br />When I called Amazon and told them that they sent the movie over night to me.  I was very pleased with that.  Now I only have to mail the movie to my uncle.<br /><br />For that reason, since I purchase 90% from Amazon for my uncle, I am dropping my prime membership.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen & Paris make a great combination.  The interesting way Owen Wilson is transported back to earlier times with the great writers and artists of a golden age long past while the real star of the movie is Paris, itself.  Great movie experience.
1594487154|4.0|An engaging and thought provoking look at how everyone, including you and me, are in \\"sales\\" - whether we know it or not.<br /><br />By digging beneath the surface of what \\"sales\\" really is, Dan Pink illustrates how the fundamental activity of sales - persuading others to part with their resources in exchange for something we have that they want - is a universal activity in which nearly everyone participates in some way. According to Dan Pink, sales and \\"non-sales selling\\" are all about moving others, whether it be in traditional sales, management, education, parenting, etc.<br /><br />In part one, the author explores what exactly \\"sales\\" means, and explains how and why it's something much larger and more encompassing that many of us would otherwise believe. The author also discusses three trends that have contributed to the current environment in which sales and \\"non-sales selling\\" have become so pervasive, and explores how the shift from information inequality (where the seller knew more than the buyer) to information parity (where the buyer knows as much or more than the seller) has lead to shift from \\"buyer beware\\" (caveat emptor) to \\"seller beware\\" (caveat venditor).<br /><br />In part two, Pink provides insights into three key behaviors that will serve us in the new world where sales and \\"non-sales selling\\" are so pervasive. These are the new ABCs of selling: Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity. In part three, the author offers tools to help readers succeed in this new world of pervasive sales: how to Pitch our ideas to those we wish to \\"move\\"; how to Improvise when things don't go as planned; and how to Serve those we hope to move.<br /><br />Like he did in his previous book DRIVE, Dan Pink bases his argument on research studies from social sciences as well as his own research and interviews. The result is both compelling and convincing. The author writes with an engaging style that, combined with his self-effacing and personal anecdotes from the activities andinterviews he did while researching the book, makes this an easy and enjoyable read.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this book, and plan to re-read it and work on ways to incorporate its ideas and suggestions into my work and personal life. I did have one minor quibble with the book. I would have liked to see a few more examples of how the ideas in the book show up in various non-sales selling fields such as education, management, parenting, etc.<br /><br />In case I was too subtle about it, I heartily recommend this book. This should be a \\"must read\\" for anyone working in sales, and should be in the library of educators, managers, and anyone and everyone interested in learning to be more effective when moving others.<br /><br />[Disclaimer: I received a complimentary pre-press, uncorrected proof copy of this book for being part of the \\"Launch Team\\" for this book.]
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have to admit I bought this book because of all the hype; I won't do that again. It's very hard to read a heroine who is weak and allows herself to be embroiled in these situations; definitely not my cup of tea. The sex scenes were good at first, but fast became tedious. I won't be buying the followups...in fact, I don't think I'll be able to finish this one!
B007TUAHVQ|2.0|This is a very hard toy to put together. My son, who puts together Legos all the time, had a lot of trouble.  Very frustrating.  He is really into the Halo but I do not think that I will be buying anymore of these sets.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|Big fans of Big Bang Theory!  We are having the most fun watching shows we missed before we became fans.
0062082353|5.0|A great book by one hell of a Seal.  Chris Kyle is a hero and I enjoyed reading of his exploits with the Navy Seals.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Big fans of Big Bang Theory! Now we don't have to keep watching reruns we have already seen 1,000 times.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|This is no great movie.  But if youy want to see your favorite old action heroes in crazy silly action this movie is for you.  I knew what to expect and thoiught it was fun
B003O86FMW|5.0|Full of suspense and never ending twits that will keep you glued from start to finish!  I am recommending this book for all readers alike
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Glued to Season 1 and Season 2 last week during the holidays with my mother. She taught English (Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice) for years, and kept telling me that to watch to show. I'm now completely hooked. The finale of Season 2 is one of the most romantic and entertaining shows I've ever seen, and I watched it again last night! Can't wait for Season 3 to start Jan 6th.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|The only other Nerf guns we bought a few years back were very disappointing.  They always jammed and my 6 year old at the time had a hard time pumping the gun.  He had been eyeing this particular Nerf gun for a while and seeing that it was electric appealed to me for his sake.  I bought 2 of them (for Nerf gun wars of course and so I could actually play with one :)).  My son and I LOVE these guns.  They are so easy for him to use and the darts really go farther than I truly thought they would.  I bought him extra clips, darts and the Nerf vest as well.  If you buy the gun I would recommend buying extra clips so all 8 chambers will be used.  The price I paid for the gun on Amazon and the other items was more than worth it for hours of fun!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Awesome dogs perspective of the world...for a book...although the book is rather depressing it is more real than a downer.
B005XLN97M|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old and not only was it easy to put together but it's very durable.  It came with some furniture and kitchen/bathroom items.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love the pretty interface and content discovery. Needs more explanation on what shows up and how to manage that.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a typical teen movie with good music and dancing.  It was also funny.  My teen daughter and I loved it.
B000L53D4O|3.0|I thought it would have lights and music but it didn't. I would order from them again in the future.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites from when I was a kid, I remember reading it with my mom...now I'm reading it with my girls and loving it all over again!!
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|If you are a person obsessed with the time-space continuum, then you will not enjoy this movie. Do not buy or rent it because it isn't for you. You will be constantly looking for plot holes, etc. to prove or disprove any scientific theories you have. If you are a hopeless romantic (like me) however, rent/purchase this movie and enjoy every second of it. Not only is this another chance to see Reeves and Bullock together again (what's not to love about that), but it's such a super sweet story and it made me believe in the idea of soul mates once again. I love this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read this book in less then two days. It really is a great book with so many emotions wrapped into it..
B008G33NFC|5.0|Got overexcited when ordering....bought the DVD instead of the CD, but worth it.  Will probably buy the CD later.<br /><br />If you like Nightwish, you'll love to see their ex singer live!
B004U52VPS|3.0|This is a play off the internet game; but the pieces are as stable. This is a birthday present and will soon find out if well received.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game. Good to past the time with. Have enjoyed it on my Kindle. I am used to playing Spider Solitair on the PC but this is good
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I thought Ken Follet had reached his peak with Pillars of the Earth and World without End but I was wrong.  Fall of Giants and Winter of the World were even better.  This was Follet at his best.  It was absolutely impossible to put either book down.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|it is good but when I try to buy things I'm shop it brings me to the purchase with real money please fix
B008X8QCTO|5.0|Kindle Fire- .No problems at all, great everything. Only drawback is a total 604MB! It took a while to load,etc, but I expected that - more or less. KF users need to take the scary sounding step and reset to factory default to free up all the memory. Yes, you lose some stats, etc, but you no longer have to fight download errors. Also make sure to delete apps AND clear data AND clear cache or you`'re not getting it all deleted from your Kindle. I think so anyhow...
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Standard Clancy story. Lots of characters, long buildup and quick ending.  Enjoyable read.  Premise is believeable and how the conflict is resolved is also believable.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Passes the time by. Not that hard but keeps u busy for hours. When there is nothing else to do it keeps my busy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I first started reading this series I didn't know what it was about & when I got to chapter 8 I was like holy hell. I love the love story & the playfulness of the characters. When I got to the end I was sad that it was over. This series left me wishing it wasn't over & wanting more.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love the graphics used with the weather report.  Because of the graphics I can easily and quickly know how temperature discourses without getting out if bed and opening my blinds.  This app is a 5+ for my needs.
0891419195|5.0|Want to take a trip into the past during 1940's? This impressive novel offers it. Or are you contemplating whether to enlist into the United States Marine Corps? This book is a must have because in comparison with the gadgets that we have today, we are somewhat in a spoiled way of living. Sledge highlights the hardships that the &#34;Old Breed&#34; had to face. War is hell, it is not filled with glory. This is a must read to truly understand what our forefathers fought for and what credit we should give them for the price they paid.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a fascinating story!<br /> I want to continue reading the next books in the series. First sexual book that I have read in years, that was exciting.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I had Tron on VHS and wanted it on DVD.  We really like the tech element and enjoyed the movie for years!
B005VPRETE|4.0|My 8 year old daughter received this for Christmas. She LOVES the LEGO Friends. Didn't take her long to assemble the pieces and the instructions are great. All in all, a great purchase!
0792843584|5.0|I thought the dvd was great. I will be buying more dvds soon and theres no telling what else i will buy
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This read was my first Tim Ferriss book, and admittedly, I've always been a bit skeptical of the notion that one can hack work or body like his book titles imply.  But after seeing the great results of a friend putting the principles of the 4-Hour Body into practice, I decided it was time to give one of Tim's books a try.<br /><br />I'm certainly glad I did!  I especially liked the \\"learning smells\\" and \\"deconstructing food\\" ideas in the meta-learning section.  Throughout the book, the various personal stories and anecdotes of how Tim applied learning techniques make for an interesting and quick read despite the book's size.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|This movie is terrible.  Stupid, oversexualized without a purpose, boring.  Terrible.  Do not waste your time watching.  Good talent, but poor script, how do these things make it to the big screen?
0762761296|5.0|The human spirit is amazingly resilient! This is an inspirational story. That it is a TRUE story, makes it all the more inspiring. Highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's intriguingly sexy and wakes up every girls inner goddess that she has within. I recommend this to all the women out thete
B00371QQ2U|5.0|I was so disappointed when my DVD stopped playing.  I love this movie and the Blu-Ray version is great.  So glad I could find the movie.<br /><br />The additional features were a nice too.
B002N44XSG|4.0|I would recommend this book to action and mythical lovers.the book is a great read it is phenomenal kids to read but it is in the middle of the series of Percy Jackson and the Olympians.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I needed this for a class assignment.  My expectations were low, but the reading went fairly quickly.  Some sections were harder to read than others.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An absolutely amazing book with a perfect story line about the important and treasured things in life. Recommend for everyone!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was such a good book. With just a hint of rebellion in every page.that is why I gave it a 5. I recommend it to everyone!
6304498969|5.0|Picture quality was not real clear but I though it was cd. Anyway returned for a cd instead. thank you.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't put down this book once i started!! love it!!! I can't wait to read another book by Jamie McGuire.
B001W63DX2|5.0|My husband is a big Iron Maiden fan and he has been wanting this dvd so when I saw it I bought it!<br />Very prompt delivery!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I would highly recommend it to any of my friends.  I Read the series.
B00ANR2H4M|5.0|I stumbled upon season 1 for free, and it was good. Honestly, if it wasn't free, I wouldn't have continued with it though. In season one the actors and characters were great, the story line was deep, however, it felt like the watered down, luke-warm modern horror movies of today. There just wasn't enough suspense, horror, blood and gore. I grew up in the 80's. Something happened between now and then, with TV, movies and the like. It's almost as if we have \\"dumbed\\" everything down, for this meeker, generation. So if you aren't into blood, guts, and gore, with a twisted plot, that you have to follow, I suggest you stick to lighter fluffier stuff like \\"Twilight\\" or \\"Gossip Girls\\" and leave the dark stuff to us.<br /><br />This season was MUCH scarier than the first! It touched many controversial topics. The writing, acting and characters were just as good as the first season. But I feel the show in it's entirety, grew up. It went from the mildly suspenseful, to the heart-stopping, jaw-dropping edge of your seat horror, that this genre has been missing for a few decades.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|First time I have read this author and thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I have already recommended it and will read more of her.
0689835604|5.0|I liked this book because it teaches other body parts as well (such as hands and feet). It is great for teaching prepositions such as under, behind, etc. Don't let your child have it independently if they tear paper or tags out of books.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Despite the fact that this series was outside of my typical genre I thoroughly enjoyed the conclusion as well as the series.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Entire family Loves this movie! I loved the message and the transformation from bad to evil. Great movie! My daughter watches it everyday!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and was enthralled to continue to read the final book of the series.  have recommended it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Took my granddaughter to this movie when it was in the theaters.  It was her first experience and she is so small we had to hold down her seat.  But she LOVED the movie so of course when we came home I had to immediately &#34;pre-order&#34; it.  It is a marvelous movie and even grown-ups love it.  You will be singing the songs for days to come!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this Bible app is exactly what is needed and delivers with flawless precision. thank you so much! Your hard work is appreciated here!
0316069884|5.0|This book changed my life. It is worded so eloquently, with facts, researched out over several years. His opinion and his lifestyle is stated at the end of the book, not throughout, which I appreciated. The author began this book to figure out what type of food he would be feeding to his new baby, a parallel to my life, although I have been vegetarian for many many years. I thought I was living a cruelty free life, little did I know and what I wouldn't give to have known this sooner. I had no idea of the atrocities of life for these poor farmed animals,not even covered under any welfare laws. As I have researched into it further and further, I am astonished as to how this is not on daily news, in papers and on billboards. People would not want to eat these animals after seeing how they are raised and treated and not cared for, if that doesn't get you then the slaughtering process with the focus on speed and the amount of ecoli in your food should. Its horrifying.<br /><br />I feel blessed for having read this book and will support this author and his work as long as I live, which will be extra long now that I am vegan. I live a conscious life now through my food choices, clothing and shoe choices and make up choices thanks to this book. It takes only one catalyst to change your life and I will forever be grateful that I have awakened in this one.<br /><br />Read this book and share it with everyone you know, you may save their life.
B005YDLJ76|3.0|I feel though the DVb brought  nothing new to the table  her career her performances has been  for a few years I was hoping that this DVD with show her more intimate and soul foul side of her yes it was a really nice DVD but I don't give it a 5 star I am tired of the past she needs to put Destiny's Child in all that is behind her I want to see something new amore improve be on say I have been seeing you these since performances Dangerously in Love but the performance is the head to do with album 4 were awesome but she wasted almost 3 hours on showing how her career started I seen that on the last for DVD's
B0000033IS|5.0|What can I say other than, Queen of Soul moves the feet, the heart and raises one to the power of loving that bad boy! I love all her music. My era, my time, and always will be.
0439023513|5.0|I personally didn't like the ending but regardless the book is great.  Awesome writing and scenes.  If you haven't read this series, you must.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read hundreds of books on my kindle and I've never felt the need to write a review, until now!  I can't put into words how amazing this book is, you just have to read it!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I really like this game and it gets challengeing the higher level you reach....I will play it all night, you should get it!
B007SGM084|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.  ONE OF THE BEST THING I HAVE READ IN A VERY LONG TIME.  HATE THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO TYPE IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS FOR THIS REVIEW
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I got a Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; for Christmas and this wonderful case. I love how sturdy it is for holding my Fire while I watch movies or read. I am also able to feel confident that my Fire is protected when I put this case into my purse. This is a very nice case for the price. I highly recommend it!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love playing this game, it is my go-to game when I have time to myself. Will tell my friends about this game.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I can now write on the go with this app from WordPress. It makes keeping up to date on my website a snap!
B00127RAJY|5.0|It's a quick, 20 minute workout that will make you sweat and burn calories. Great for those days when you don't have time to go to the gym, but still want to get it in.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have used avast FREE security software for awhile and love how it keeps my devices safe from intruders. A must have for your phone, computer and Kindle!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Knowing the love language of a person gives you insight into their priorities.  It also helps when two of you that don't speak the same love language have a way to relate.  My daughters' language is gifts, her fathers' is service, this book was as helpful as a foreign language dictionary to them.  For years they had tried to show love and the other person had not comprehended it at all.  For families, managers, leaders, anyone dealing with others: it is essential to understand your own language as well as that of those you interact with, underlying their spoken words will be their basic languages.  These aren't only used for love, but for most of daily personal interactions,
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|If you want to have an app that will teach you all about the moon and its many phases then this is the app for you! At any given time I can know exactly how the moon will look on what day. It also will give you a view of the moon on a monthly calendar. I have this app on my phone and also my Kindle Fire HD. Definitely worth it!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|As grandparents of an autistic grandson we have been thrilled to have a person with this disability put her life into print.<br />I can recommend this book to all teachers and youth leaders.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|What more needs to be said? A dictionary with you at ALL times so you can write that perfect letter or blog! Awesome!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Playing and winning this game is a great way to keep your mind active. A fun form of solitaire.  Will keep you engaged for hours!
B0030MM68O|5.0|This movie does a great job of expressing the stress of war on the human soul.  For the politically inclined, it also demonstrates the cost to our young men and women in uniform that the Iraq war has extracted.<br /><br />Setting: so realistic we had to look up where it was filmed.  When you do this yourself you will be surprised by the location and extras used.<br /><br />Acting: Excellent!  Jeremy Renner has taken over as one of the premier action stars of the current time.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Not funny at all!  A failed attempt at a funny movie, all funny parts seen on previews!!!  Do not waste your time
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Got this as a Amazon freebie and it offers a good combination of Jewel-like play combined with extra challenges that keep it from getting too easy.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app does what it needs to do: it gives you the weather. But that is a great tool to have (especially when you live in a temperamental environment like me!), and &quot;Weather Channel&quot; does a great job.<br /><br />Temperature, precipitation, heat index/wind chill, and a host of other important factors are displayed simply for ease of use. By giving you a look at current conditions, hourly changes, and a 10-day forecast, it can definitely help you plan ahead. So yeah, it gives you the weather....not a shocker. But it's not bad to have, either.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Amazing value for the price, I absolutely love Harry Potter and could watch it a thousand times and not get tired
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Can hardly wait for another John Corey novel. The plots are always exciting and this was not a disappointment. KUDOS !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book! By far the best she has written so far. Always kept me guessing and had a heart stopping romance to boot! Can't wait to see what this author will be coming out with next :)
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A great book with wisdom and has many important lessons in it that should be treasured by people in today's world.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it. It is a great way to spend time when bored.The only thing is that when I try to skip hard missions it makes me skip easier ones.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Sometimes I just want a nice, quiet logical puzzle game without a frantic adrenaline rush and yet something that stretches my mental muscles.  Quell is ideal.  It accurately portrays several of the laws of physics, is very smooth and pleasing to the eye, with pleasant sound effects and lots and lots of puzzles to solve.  Very well done and a really nice change of pace.
0385360169|1.0|Wow, I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />Flat characters. Unreadable dialog. Unbelievable premise. No story (unless boring and unrealistic sex is a plot.)<br /><br />Seems to have been written by a 15-year-old girl living in a romantic fantasy.<br /><br />And the narrator in the audio version is just about the worst I've ever heard.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Although very dark his book is nécessaire to make people think about the solutions to the social maïseries of our times
B001P06GX4|4.0|This game is fairly inexpensive (about $16 right now), the instructions are very easy. You can play the game in 3-4 different ways based on the number of players that you have and the different ways are indicated in the instructions. The game can be played pretty quickly - in under 30 minutes usually and it's fun for the whole family. I would recommend this game mostly for children especially because the strategy is pretty simple as compared to something like Risk or Settlers of Catan.<br /><br />If you are looking to put some more money into a purchase and looking for more complex strategy you may wish to try Settlers of Catan.
B000063DFN|5.0|Simply one the best Iron Maiden albums ever. Musicality and lyrics are as always, the best. My favorite album from Iron Maiden.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|its nice to not have to type in a browser. downfall is app freezes after a few posts on newsfeed. several times had to exit out of FB and restart app.
B0033WDCRA|5.0|This is the best collection of original Frankie Goes To Hollywood music available. Buy this as soon as possible and enjoy.
B005723JSQ|5.0|As per the usual I couldn't put the book down. Sophie Kinsella always pulls me into her world and I just don't want to leave.
B003JTHESA|4.0|The latest from one of the all time best heavy metal bands of all time. Excellent production and outcome from Maiden. You will enjoy this album from beginning to end.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This should be read by everyone! It touches your heart ,fills your mind. everyone knows of or about NDE (near death experiences) the stories are always profound  this  one is that and so much more. Dr. Eben Alexander lll  writes his experience in a way that those that believe in Heaven will be comforted, but more that the unbeliever  will as well. Perhaps to their surprise.<br /><br />It is all wonderful, and thank you D. Eben for giving this wonderful book to everyone.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Hard to review when my reading is not complete.<br />Wpuld have more to say if I had finished the book.
B005LAII80|1.0|This is not a story, and doesn't even deserve to be called a \\"movie\\". There is no plot, the characters are beyond bland and one-dimensional, you don't care about anyone, you don't care what happens, yadda yadda yadda. Like all-too-many futuristic sci-fi flicks, this thing relies on special effects and gore and caters to the most base male populace. This is \\"entertainment\\" in the sickest sense, a long drudgery of bodies being shot, stabbed, shredded, gored, and yes, even skinned alive. Oh, and don't forget the scene graphically depicting oral sex that goes disgustingly violent. Can't have a movie without that, right? Add in a ridiculous amount of slow-motion special effects (yeah, the first time, you think \\"OK, cool\\" but then it happens again... and again... and again...). I couldn't wait for this thing to end. It was disgusting, gratuitously violent, and just plain stupid. Trying to tie the thing up in a bag about a \\"bleak futuristic landscape\\" where criminals abound and only blood-spattering \\"justic\\" will save the day... nope, it doesn't help save this inane waste of filmmaking.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not my kind of book, I dont plan to read the others in the triology.<br />Not for every person and far fetched.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|In my opinion this movie is a disappointment.  It falls far short of the products that have been produced by Pixar in the past.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|This is exactly what my son wanted.  Works great and was easy to install and use.  He is one happy gamer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not a prude-but thiis is straight porn-no plot, no story content, just sex, sex and more sex- maybe some like to read about it frankly i would rather particpate in my own home and keeo it priovate and personal
B000N3AWDE|5.0|&#34;On S'est Aime a Cause&#34; is my favorite Celine song now. I can't wait to get &#34;Sans Attendre&#34;, her new album.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game because it really challenges my brain. Its great for logic and reasoning. Forces me to really use my noggin!
B004RE2J7W|5.0|Made during the height of Beatlemania, director Richard Lester's A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a b&w simulation of a day in the life of the Fab Four that includes a live TV show concert. Superb rapid-paced dialogue comes across as ad-lib; the boys show much acting and comedic talent. Unforgettable music also in what is the very finest of this genre.<br /><br />Songs performed or heard on soundtrack: \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" \\"I Should Have Known Better,\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Man,\\" \\"Don't Bother Me,\\" \\"All My Loving,\\" \\"If I Fell,\\" \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You,\\" \\"Tell Me Why,\\" \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"This Boy (Ringo's Theme)\\"&lt;--(George Martin orchestra).<br /><br />Cameos by George Harrison's future wife, Pattie, a very young Phil Collins (drummer/vocalist for Genesis), and as \\"Tall Dancer at the Disco,\\" Jeremy Lloyd, co-creator and producer of the perennially popular BBC TV sitcom, [[ASIN:B002I9TZHA ARE YOU BEING SERVED?]] Lester himself appears briefly as \\"Man in Back of the Stage.\\"<br /><br />Several years later, the film's associate producer Denis O'Dell was lampooned by John as \\"Mr. Denis O'Bell\\" during his spoken intro of the Beatles' single flipside, \\"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number).\\" With mouth firmly on mike, Paul (as Denis) then croons a lounge lizard vocal of this strange tune.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.6) A Hard Day's Night (UK-1964) - The Fabs/Wilfred Brambell/Norman Rossington/John Junkin/Victor Spinetti/John Bluthal (uncredited: Pattie Boyd/Phil Collins/Jeremy Lloyd/Richard Lester)
B005HSL626|5.0|My son was amazed playing this on someones phone at a CVS one day. Now I use it to keep him quiet in the waiting room at Dr appts!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This to me is the funniest entertains movies since Step-brothers, both bring a smile and giggle just thinking of the movie! I hope there is a sequel!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The information is clear and concise with the ability to plug in more then one city to view. This is great for  a quick look at the weeks up coming weather story.
B0057LUI0O|4.0|fun and bright colors good for any age it was a fun family movie that we all enjoyed watching and we bought it from amazon didgital
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I finished this in three days, despite a ft job and two toddlers. I missed the story when i wasn't reading and feel like I'm saying goodbye to family. This book was difficult, at times so dark. I loved every bit of it. I'm off to do in-depth research on slavery.
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|a very good adaption of the childrens books classic we loved it and im adult any age you gotta see it you know you read it
1401235417|5.0|Scott Snyder has been writing some of the best Batman stories to date, and he doesn't stop short on this one. With some excellent art, a detailed and well thought out plot, the story of the Owls takes shape and really dives deep into the heart and core of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Any and every Batman fan should be following this arc.
B004IDG97S|4.0|this is an oldly but a goody action comedy im sure most every one has seen it at some time
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have purchased all of the Pendergast books in CD form, just because we usually use them on cross country travels. As usual this was an excellent book and a good conclusion to the three book series, but I was not overly happy with the ending (in my case CD # 14).  It had nothing to do with the plot, but rather the method in which the story was wrapped up, i.e kind of like an epilog (which is maybe what it was intended).  We have an almost world altering event and then in the next chapter we're writing our memoirs (so to speak), with no connecting dialog.
B003QSMC18|3.0|fun spooky a little to much for young child in my opinion with dark magic and light magic making witchery something good
145210655X|5.0|Fun book for Star Wars fans. If you did not watch the Star Wars movies, like myself, then you probally will not get it.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|we all liked it for moderate age children i would say not under 8 its a difinate holloween movie so enjoy
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I read this book after reading the series about the Crystal Shard and appreciate the life of Drizzt much more knowing where the character moves on to later in his life. But even if this is the first Forgotten Realm novel you read, you'll love it and be hooked! I know I am; I love the forgotten ream novels and plan on reading every single one! A great (easy enough) read for any fantasy fan!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|well if you grew up running home from school to catch the strange world of vampire and witches soap opera you will find this to be spoofy it was funny and the soap was spooky at the time
B008QI6EHQ|5.0|It's hard for me to put a 5 Star review next to a book that, in my opinion, is the writings of pure evil - however, I have no choice but to say that it should be required reading of anyone interested in understanding not only our past, but our future as well.<br /><br />This book is, and will forever remain, timeless.  If we continue to forget history, and refuse to remember the darkest times of our being on this earth, we will only fail to stop the tragedies from being repeated time and time again.<br /><br />What you will find within the pages of this book...  History - and a reflection of what our future can easilly become if we fail to right the ship that we are sailing.  I recommend all read this, and understand where OUR nation is headed, as well as the world.<br /><br />See if you can find links to the thought processes and justifications in the pages here, to the thought processes and justifications that we are finding ourselves faced with today.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|there must be a part in this movie for every hero from every movie that is still living full of action that all were noted for a blend of comedy and action short on story a definate man flick but i enjoyed it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I could play this for hours, sometimes I get stumped for awhile but I finally solve it. This is great for keeping your brain stimulated.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|it is full of action magic and adventure with the upgrades in what movie magic is available to day we have prime it was a prime movie
B007J4T2G8|5.0|THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ!!!! I didn't want to put it down. All I wanted to do was keep reading all day.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|i like the older version more but this has such good grafics and action and it does a decent job on the christmas clasical of charles dickens
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|it was different than I had expected. I like that it allows you to choose which sector you would like to search after you type the criteria.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|every thing is showing up angry birds and there is even a movie coming out LOL i have to admit i want to bound those grinning piggys LOL
B008476HBM|5.0|The book was written more than 50 years ago, but can still be like today. Pride can get in the way of almost anything, and so can being prejudice. The modern spin is called Prom and Prejudice. The people changed to fit the time, but not the message. It is a wonderful book worth reading.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|have to watch this every year i bought on amazon digital so was able to let my kids children watch miles away love you amazon prime
B004P1JEXE|4.0|Again with this edition it is hard to keep up with the different characters. The story is not focussed on all of the main characters but has enough twists and turns if you can put up with some of the life stories and extended descriptions of characters and terrain. Still it has enough entrigue to want to get book 5 to contunue the saga.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|this will be one of those movies like sound of music was for me for my granddaughter her christmas wish was for a bow and arow  go figure
B0083D9MXM|5.0|Fortunately for all of us, Sony management decided to come true a long time wish. To have these musical achievements of the maverick director Stoky, through his recordings on Columbia Records.<br /><br />De Falla is good, but unfortunately the vocal support is not at the same level.<br /><br />You will find the most outrageous reading of Beethoven Fifth with Glenn Gould.<br /><br />Bizet's album is a worthy to call the attention. Arlessian Suite is the best the money can buy.<br /><br />Sibelius First is remarkable, intense and mercurial.<br /><br />His Mendelssohn is inspired and dazzling.<br /><br />Nevertheless to my view, Ives Fourth Symphony takes the cake. Since 1965 this NorthAmerican premiere has not been unsurpassed.<br /><br />An album worthy to have and collect. Don't miss it and express what words are not able to define as a gift for a very dear friend.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended.<br /><br />With my last review of the year I wish you a very good 2013 for all Amazon's comunity as well for the entire world.<br /><br />Happy new year!!!!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|ok how many times can a girl watch this movie  a lot yep a lot now brave is the best

B005HSG3TC|5.0|i love it more than you can know.  too hard to put to words. i dont like that i have to do this.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|growing up with the bear every one knows it speaks and interacts with the guys not for children really not for children
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|This soundtrack is perfect if you, like me, enjoyed hearing the songs acted as well as sung. I've been listening to this album non-stop since watching the film. My only complaint would be that some of the songs had sections cut out (most noticeably in Look Down and the ABC Cafe/Red & Black). I love these songs and would like to hear them in their entirety, but I'll take what I can get.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy this show.  The cast is quite funny, the characters are unique and well-played.  The show is light-hearted and smart, a great watch for a good laugh.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I hadn't read A Christmas Carol since I was 12 years old. It was great to read it again and remember the classic story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his Christmas ghosts.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is a classic! We watch it every Christmas and several times through the year! Every home should have a copy!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is a lovely story about four sisters and their joys and sorrows of growing up. I loved this book because it was easy to read, it was a great story, and it was free on my kindle.
B005HSL626|5.0|Totally fun! You will get hooked instantly, just keep up with time because it will fly by very quick while you're playing!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I got this third one because the other two were already on my kindle, and I couldn't wait until the third one became available at the library. These books were really fascinating and the story was fast-paced and intriguing. I'm glad I now have all three in my collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is wooing awesome I love it! please get this app its worth the 7 bucks. it brings you backward a couple of updates but its still awesome
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I find the stories fun and entertaining. I remember trying to read them when I was in my early teens but couldn't quite grasp it. I'm glad I've picked them up again. Trying to figure out the solution before Holmes is not always possible but it's fun trying.
0316069434|3.0|I believe that I have every one of the Harry Bosch novels and enjoyed them all ... great reads. It seems to me that Michael had a difficult time finding inspiration this time. This was the first of his novels that I sensed that a number of the twists and turns were contrived just to fill page space - in fact the &#34;Black Box&#34; analogy strikes a really weak link and from that point on, the novel was disappointing.<br />I think Michael Connelly is clearly one of the best writers alive but it appears to me that Harry Bosch is no longer able to carry Michael's interest intensely enough to be worth while.
B000Y9PILI|4.0|I agree with other posters that the sound mix on this album is different than the vinyl version but it is still really good.  I just regret I waited so many years to get it again.  With all the new technology I am downloading a lot of older classic music that were my favorites in the past.
B0011TNVLY|1.0|It's a great movie of course that's why I got it but the quality sucked! Not worth the money! Save yourself some money and go to Walmart and buy it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fast moveing and fun. Made from one of the best childrens movies. Rise to higher and higher levels with the more work you do. I love it&iexcl;
B004I8WD6E|4.0|this case is great! I have been looking for a simple case and this one is great. Feels a little rubbery, not a hard plastic. I would recommend this case .
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A predictable formula fiction book.  The main characters are reasonably well drawn.  There could have been a bit more character development of the whole falling in love plot line--I felt it was lacking in convincing details.  Still, it was a quick fun read and I got it for free so how can I complain?
B009JBZH54|5.0|I think these movies are very well done.  I thought the value for the money was really good.  It also comes with a free digital copy.  Amazing value!!!!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|My 4 year old really likes to play this. I think the little noises are adorable. Helps him think.  There are some levels I have to help him with, but overall utter keeps him entertained.
1118109791|5.0|great product, official guide, lots of questions and explainations, helps me abunch when preparing for the exam. highly recommended for all GMAT takers
B000FC21PA|5.0|I have been interested in the Philosophical aspects of Hinduism and Buddhism and find Siddhartha a lovely story of a Brahmin boy who broke away from the ritualistic tradition practiced by his parents. He left home, along with his close friend, Govinda, in search of the meaning behind his existence. After studying the austerities and practices of Samanic Tradition and developing occult powers, he left the Samans to move on to listen to the teachings of Buddha. He highly valued and respected Buddha as a teacher, yet he decided not to join the congregation of monks and left to experience life on his own in search of his own meaning. During the  subsequent journey, he falls in love, has a child, and finally moves on to live with a ferryman on the banks of a river. In the end, he learns a lot from the ferry man and from the river. His quest for &#34;freedom' is finally fulfilled. I love this book. A movie was also made based on the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is amazing!  I love her twists and am shocked that I can't guess them ahead of time. I will buy all her books regardless of reviews.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Classic Pendergast intrigue. I was not disappointed after waiting for this latest installment. I anxiously await where this novel`s new twists will take us next.
B004AQR29C|1.0|One of the worst most simple-minded movies ever.  Sly needs to lead the others to the retirement home. Really, really bad!
030758836X|3.0|After hearing so many good reviews on this book, I thought I would order it instead of waiting for it  to become available at the library.  Although she is a great writer, (meaning that the book is easy to read, with a easy to follow plot)  I did not find myself immersed in the story.  I continued reading hoping for a surprise ending and was disappointed.
B007N6EUHI|4.0|I like having this product but feel frustrated with some of the limitations.  It has been great to have this convenient reference.
B000I9X7M6|5.0|The movie is a great movie to watch. It is amusing to listen to the words of Rome & Juliet!
B0086700CM|4.0|I've been tempted to download this game for a while and finally decided to recently.  It's fast paced and very addicting.
B004YM6JK0|5.0|This year I decided to shop black Friday on amazon.com and was not disappointed. I got a great deal on this blu ray. I missed some of the episodes of season 7 but its great to have this at home to watch at my leisure.
B008EL4YX6|2.0|I picked this up a while back when it was the App of the Day and played it a few times.  It's a good way to pass a little bit of time, but I uninstalled it and haven't played in a while.
B009X01D9U|5.0|By far the best case out there, as of Dec. 2012 for Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Kindle safely snaps into a strong plastic shell that can be rotated 180 degrees.  You can prop it up in both portrait and landscape, shutting the cover puts device to sleep, and there is access to all ports.  Great design with quality construction.  I recommend watching the little video included on the product page.

1401201911|5.0|I learned so much about Superman through this glimpse of what things might have been like had his life started out differently. Through the use of a tragic alternative storyline, Millar brilliantly reveals the importance of Clark's upbringing by the Kents and his arrival in America.<br /><br />Perhaps Millar's strongest lesson involves Superman's relationship with humanity. Red Son depicts a benevolent dictator rather than the symbol of hope so many of us have looked to for inspiration in our own lives. Cannot recommend this enough.

B00796E7CA|4.0|An excellent job of bringing together unfinished, partially finished, and fragmentary stories of Middle Earth along with commentary.  As background material, it doesn't stand alone, but will be of considerable interest to those already familiar with Middle Earth's history and mythology.

0307593312|5.0|Like its Orwellian namesake, this incredible book is an absolute MUST read.  It is so well conceived, so well told, so incredible in its grand scope and yet its compelling detail, this book defies description or classification.  You are engaged, held, mesmerized, surprised, and left, if possible, satiated yet hungry for more.  This is not an oxymoron.  I strongly suggest that one reads, thinks, digests, waits a while, and then reads a second time.  It is impossible, on the first read, to fully appreciate and comprehend what is provided here.  If I were still a professor, this would be required reading for any course in sociology, psychology, political science, or literature.  The brilliance of  the author to conceive, develop, frame, and present this story with such craft is overwhelming.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Full of even more twists ans turns you could ever imagine, this was an amazing second book to the hunger games! I literally could not put this book down, I just had to keep finding out what was gonna happen. Very intense read! The world of Panem that Suzanne Collins has created in these books is very raw and edgy. As more of the brutal and barbarian ways of the capital are revealed along with the unity between the districts form, you will be so sucked into this book you'll be holding your breath until you're turning the last page.

0307593525|1.0|The item was delivered on time, but the quality was just not there. This was a Christmas present for my wife.<br /><br />Many ink marks and dots on pages from the pringing process; in fact, some words were not legable. Some examples include major ink smudges on pg 34, 36, 37, 42,43, 212 the back of the book has black ink marks on it.<br /><br />This book appears to be a rejected copy and I do not remember seeing that in the description of the book.

B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I liked the actors they chose for the movie and the computer animations and effects were excellent.<br /><br />The story... it's not something that should/could be reused in the 21st century/2012, if you ask me. Chemical warfare, revolution, dictatorship, and Asian or Cyrillic writing (not sure if it was Korea or what...) was a touch too 1980's for me. Don't get me wrong, the movie was fun to watch but about the level of Equilibrium. The world they created was just too antiquated for movies of this caliber. There was too much Cold War context for my taste in it. I watched it twice on separate days and it was a nice, casual movie to watch. It's the kind where you walk away, return, and don't feel that you missed much.<br /><br />I'd rent it somewhere for cheap or wait until it is available for streaming for free because it's not worth the money to buy it. Even if you appreciate Colin or Jessica's appealing physique, not worth the money to pay more than $10 for the bluray.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|I heard some very good things about this game so I thought &quot;Sure, I'll buy it.&quot;<br />So after I paid my $.99, it refuses to install on my Galaxy S2 skyrocket. I have plenty of space on both my original hard drive and my SD card.<br />It's too bad that I can't give this game more of a fair review. It seemsvery enjoyable. First time I've honestly been let down by Amazon.

I felt like I devoured it. One thing though when I got to the end I thought for sure there had to be more, Buy now I'm not sure if it's because I felt like there wasn't really an ending or if I really just wanted more.Buy Gone Girl it is incredible.

B00AMBH70S|4.0|As other reviewers noted, story and characterizations are done well, and breaks away cleanly into a new story arc. Renner has done an excellent job, but direction does not stand up to the high standards set by earlier releases. Camera work is better than the earlier ones - it used to swing and jump so much during action scenes in the earlier installments that it gives a headache.<br /><br />Engaging story, excellent acting and action, good entertainment. Unfortunately not enough to make it a cultish favourite.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Mis&eacute;rables Is an experience. Director Tom Hooper has realized this timeless and often repeated Victor Hugo novel that was transformed into a near operatic setting by Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg, Alain Boublil and Herbert Kretzmer by opening up the story even more and utilizing genuinely creative musical enhancements. The result is an emotionally charged, breathtaking spectacle that while it is discussing the French Revolution and aftermath as a subject it remains a gently warm tale of love and commitment.<br /><br />The cast is extraordinary, down to the smallest role in the film. It is truly an Ensemble work and deserves recognition as such, but the individuals should also be honored individually.  Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is completely immersed in this multifaceted and very difficult role: it is the zenith of his career both as a film and as a stage actor/singer. Equally impressive (and a surprise to those of us who knew nothing of this early career in musical theater) is Russell Crowe's Javert - very deserving of Best Supporting Actor at Oscar time for his powerful embodiment of misguided and tortured head of police, but for some reason he is being overlooked. Anne Hathaway gives us a Fantine that will be the benchmark for all others who sing this role. Amanda Seyfried handles Cosette's difficult soprano lines with relative ease and feels completely right in her approach to the role. Another major shock is Eddie Redmayne as Marius: we all are aware of his acting sills, but this young man has a splendid voice and makes his character one of the standouts of the story. Samantha Barks as &Eacute;ponine is a star turn, combining screen presence with fine acting and a solid vocal ability.<br /><br />Each of the lads who spark the revolutionary barricade is outstanding; Aaron Tveit as Enjolras completely wins hearts with his handsome looks, his sensitive acting and his very fine voice and close behind him is performance quality are George Blagden, Killian Donnelly, Fra Fee, Gabriel Vick and for course Daniel Huttlestone as the young spunky Gavroche. Director Hooper has given us a different take on the Th&eacute;nardiers - no silly slapstick here, but instead a smarmy, oily evil couple whose behavior at other people's expense make us laugh: Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen make them unforgettable. And it is a true bow to theatrical history to cast Colm Wilkinson (who originated the role of Jean Valjean in 1980) as the Bishop.<br /><br />In all this is a stunning success, visually, vocally, acting, directing, costuming, and large ensemble wise.  It is unforgettable.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, December 12n Donnelly, Fra Fee, Gabriel Vick and for course Daniel Huttlestone as the young spunky Gavroche.

B0086213XW|2.0|Not for guys.  I found this movie boring and turned it off several times before finally finishing it.  I saw Michelle Williams in \\"Blue Valentine\\" and found her endearingly charming and wanted to see her again.  I don't know if Blue Valentine was made before or after \\"Take This Waltz\\".  Michelle Williams played the same type of woman in both movies, a charmingly innocent character but deep down I found her shallow and selfish.<br /><br />In Take This Waltz she again plays a wife who becomes disenchanted with her marriage, through no fault of her husband, but because of a need for more romance and excitement.  She leaves her husband, hooks up with the other guy, and the ending scene shows her no better off.  This theme is recurring in literature throughout history and perhaps it appeals to women but it did not appeal to me and I suspect not to most men, particularly those who are married and are doing their best for their wives.<br /><br />Besides me not liking the plot the second half of the movie was also weirdly made with several surreal scenes that left me not knowing if she ever consummated her affair with the other man, and left her husband, until the very end.  Unless you want to see another movie with the charming Michelle Williams, I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I have heard good things about this book so I took a chance. Any fan of Tina's and SNL, and 30 Rock will appreciate it.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|With the &#34;F&#34; word coming out in every other sentence and then some, it made it pretty hard to watch. We lasted about 15 minutes and gave it up realizing it didn't have any real story line.<br /><br />I watch a lot of rated R movies, but this one was ridiculous. The writer obviously was going through an infantile period when he wrote it if he thought that was the only way to get laughs.

B003KRJNBW|5.0|. . . is that I know they're parables. Somebody's trying to teach me something and I didn't sign up for their class. No thanks. The book \\"The Alchemist\\" for example, I found absolutely unreadable. HOWEVER, this film is so cool that I DON'T CARE. Despite the use of established common roles for all the characters, nearly the same as any cookie-cutter samurai movie, the typical 'twists' throughout and at the end, 'the journey', and the hero, drawn up as a hybrid of Zatoichi and Yojimbo . . . despite all that, it was kind of refreshing. There's no attempt to disguise the common mechanics I just noted. Yet, I'd bet a complimentary hotel shampoo that this movie very very closely resembles the actual crappy experiences of the original apostles. Well done.
B005FVFWOI|4.0|I found the special edition anniversary set a nice purchase for those of us who remember the original album when it was first released. There are plenty of alternate song takes and previously unrelased tracks for those looking for something beyond just an anniversay re-issue. I also feel the sound quality is good and a noticable improvement over the original CD I have of the album.

B005V2S7FW|5.0|It's always a pleasure to review good software.  As a long time user of Roboform, I became irritated with the unexpected yearly costs, increasingly buggy upgrades, and broken promise of &#34;lifetime&#34; upgrades&#34; for 5 licences purchased many years ago.  With version 7, long-time  Roboform users were thrown to the curb on our lifetime promise.<br /><br />So, I started researching alternatives and switched to Lastpass.  I love this software.  It has a very robust free version that works with all major browsers.  The premium version only costs $12/year which basically extends Lastpass for mobile devices and  provides a few other benefits (check the comparison chart at the Lastpass website).  I believe $12/yr is a small cost to support future feature development of this great program.  I was able to port my roboform files over to Lastpass by downgrading my roboform to an earlier version 6.  The Lastpass documentation provides detailed instructions on the conversion process.  BTW,  Lastpass comes with great documentation and has to many features to list in a short review.<br /><br />The program automatically keeps  passwords synchronized between your devises and the Lastpass servers.  For those  worried about keeping sensitive information in the cloud don't worry,  Your data is still stored on your devices and  Lastpass uses the same  AES-256 encryption  and  secure one-way hashing security algorithms  used by the US Government for top-secret data storage. What this means is all data on their servers is totally secure (all encryption/decryption is done on your machine and your Master and Site passwords are never sent over the internet or stored  un-encrypted).  For the totally paranoid, Lastpass supports Yubikey secondary authentication.  While researching this program, i ran across a very positive and thorough security review on Steve Gibson's 'security now'  blog. Steve Gibson is a security expert who came up with terms like &#34;spyware&#34; and created the first anti-spyware programs.<br /><br />There are many &#34;pros&#34; to Lastpass but to name a few:<br /><br />Very robust freeware version.<br />Very good documentation on the Lastpass site<br />Cheap 'premium' upgrade for mobile devices<br />Very Secure in protecting your data<br />Works on all major browsers<br />Great auto-fill capabilities<br />Supports &#34;secure notes&#34;, including free storage (50 M for free version,....1G for &#34;premium&#34; ($12/year and worth it)<br /><br />Con:<br />The only con I've found is one of my imported site logins (namecheap)  didn't auto-fill at first.  But, the &#34;Save All Entered Data&#34; feature solved this problem.  Another example of the Lastpass site great support and documentation areas .

B008XG1X18|5.0|Now I can pin from bed when I can't sleep at night instead of having to get up to get on the computer. Works way better than the web-based site on a Kindle.
0374275637|4.0|The book presents great ideas, discoveries, theories, and experiments, which was a treat. On the downside I found the text overly verbose and many sections of the book read like a research paper, which make the reading a little more heavy than what I was looking for. Overall, quite insightful.
0812416503|4.0|Spoilers Within<br /><br />This is an extremely well written and crafted story. At times it literally shimmers, in particular passages describing isolated moments in time. These brilliantly capture those momentary life fragments we want not only to preserve and treasure, but to constantly relive. Daphne du Mauriers' portrayals of the luxurious vegetation at Manderley resonate with sensuousness.<br /><br />Our narrator (whose name we never know - and I assume this to be deliberate?!), her husband Maxim, and the deceased Rebecca are the main characters - but I would say we feel mostly for our narrator. I kind of see Mrs Danvers as being Rebecca - or the ghost of Rebecca. There is a taunt tension throughout.<br /><br />Before I start to be critical I do want to emphasize that I enjoyed \\"Rebecca\\" immensely - the writing, for the most part, is enthralling. It was a pleasant reading experience.<br /><br />However there were aspects that irked me. I did find it somewhat long and stretched out. The self-effacing timidity of our main protagonist became overwrought about mid-way through the reading - one almost wants to shake her and yell \\"Get some back-bone girl, and stop blaming yourself for everything!!\\".  And what a cold, uncaring fish this Maxim is! He has absolutely no radar for his wife's predicament.<br /><br />Until Favell appeared, the narrative was rather prudish - as if these people never took their clothes off. The last one hundred pages with Favell were a relief in providing needed humour and were a contrast to the first three-quarters of the book. The trial of the \\"rich Maxim\\" was a travesty of justice - the rich can get away with anything!<br /><br />The passages best summing up this romantic thriller (from page 244, chapter eighteen of my edition):<br />\\"I could fight the living but I could not fight the dead... But Rebecca would never grow old. Rebecca would always be the same... She was too strong for me\\"

B00ADIT8U2|2.0|I had much higher hopes for a game with Tesla as a focal point. one action per location, very linear plot line, no challenge to the puzzles, and no wit. my apologies to the designers. you'll get there. don't forget to check your spelling.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed reading it but disappointed in the ending.  You need to read into it quite a ways before it comes alive.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Honestly, I was really excited to read this book but it doesn't just fall short of expectation- it's a complete and utter let down.<br /><br />The style of writing? On the same level as a 9th grade girl swapping notes with hef BFF two rows over.<br /><br />The plot? Laughable at best.<br /><br />Maybe if could have actually gotten through more than just the first few chapters (though it's still no excuse for the sloppy writing equivalent to a teen's diary) it would have been better but i couldn't take it anymore. Do not waste your time reading this overly-hyped teenage girl fantasy novel.

Also not a complaint a heads up, when rotating positions there is a little effort (2 hand operation) involved due to the resistance of the quality construction. The one hand hold design is very good but with the added weight you will eventually need to utilize a leg, armchair, or belly for support. Still it is a great secure feeling feature. Ports all access no problems. Would recommend to all.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is one of the better of the recent Clancy books.  It has enough believable technical information to support the story line while not subsuming the plot.  The characters are human and have credible personalities that are consistent with their persona and occupations. Even some the protagonists have a very human emotions and a desire for self preservation.  The plot is plausible and grounded in historical and geographical reality.  The premise of a vulnerability to a cyber attack has a basis in reality that is the underpinning of the story line.  The internal politics in both China and the US is also believable.

The sound is crystal sharp. This is the best best musical DVD in my collection. You can watch it over and over and love it each time. It will blow you away. Fabulous.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is fantastically written when it comes to the honest truth. It doesn't fluff a story for the value. It's cut, raw, and real. I couldn't put it down, even stayed up all night to finish it. I learned that maybe we all need to be a wallflower in the right moments and \\"participate\\" in others.

0156012197|5.0|It's always hard to know what you'll REALY get when it says &#34;new&#34;, because &#34;new&#34; could have been sitting on a shelf in a warehouse for years....  This copy arrived very quickly and was in perfect condition.  It was shrink wrapped, and looked an felt like any new book at a new-book store.  With shipping, it was still cheaper than any physical store out there.  I checked!
B00464F19Q|1.0|This is the most unpleasant, most over-rated movie I've ever seen.  The only thing about this movie I liked was Morgan Freeman reading the last line - and given all that came before it, and the dark ending, I'm not sure the people making the movie actually believe this world is \\"worth fighting for.\\"<br /><br />Freeman (the hardened, experienced cop) teams up with Brad Pitt (the younger cop) to track down a lunatic killer who is calmly torturing and dispatching people in horrifying ways meant to depict the seven deadly sins.  The awfulness he sees at each crime scene begins to wear on the Pitt character.<br /><br />I guess I was supposed the think the end was a clever twist, but it was contrived to me.  Instead of resolving any of the interesting questions raised by the plot (how does a cop keep his hope and humanity when faced with horror every day?), the movie goes for a cheap stunt and ends abruptly.  And I don't even think the killer's stupid point was made - under the circumstances, the poor cop's reaction is temporary insanity, so I'm not sure I'd classify it as \\"sinning.\\"<br /><br />The ways in which the victims die are so disgusting and cruel that they will stay with you years after you've watched the movie.  There is no reference point of hope or even character development.  This movie is just a long, slow, hopeless, poorly-lit slog through hell.<br /><br />I can enjoy a movie like Silence of the Lambs if there is some brightness (represented by the Jodie Foster character) that balances out the horror.  I can even enjoy a slasher film, like the original Halloween, because it builds up the suspense and gives us a likeable protagonist who survives the movie.  But Seven's vision of the world is dark, hopeless and sadistic.  And why would I want to wallow in that for 2 hours?
B005LZW8FO|5.0|These arrived very quickly! ANYWHERE else I looked (and believe me, I did) this set of 3 discs cost at least $10 more, if not $20.  Great buy!
B0083GQKQG|2.0|Tilda Swinton plays an isolated, depressed woman with painful memories.  Her son, Kevin, was a hostile, difficult child from birth  She was somewhat ambivalent about motherhood, and Kevin's constant, angry crying as a baby and cruel nature as a boy make it even harder for her to bond with him.  Her husband is blissfully ignorant, in part because Kevin is skillful in showing his dad a more pleasant side.  Mother and father also have a later-in-late baby, an affectionate little girl who is nothing like her older brother.<br /><br />Kevin's calculating hostility culminates in a horrifying event that is slowly revealed in flashbacks.<br /><br />We never get an explanation of why Kevin is so hateful, and the parents never really try to get help (in fact, the dad denies anything is wrong).  Perhaps that was the intended point - that sometimes there is no explanation, sometimes people are just born bad.  However, the film hints that maybe it's because the mother didn't immediately bond with baby Kevin even though she tried (an offensive and insidious message - and Kevin's dad doting on him doesn't make him a nicer person).  It's unclear if we're supposed to blame her, or if the mom is simply blaming herself.<br /><br />The acting was great, but I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of this film.  It was a hopeless little slice of hell. If it was meant to be thought-provoking, it doesn't even try to explore any of the options Kevin's parents may have had to figure out what was going on with him.<br /><br />I also question the method of carrying out the \\"big event.\\"  I didn't find it realistic and I wondered if they steered clear of the obvious and most frequently-used instrument in such events to avoid offending certain groups. I'm being cryptic to avoid spoilers, I know, and maybe the movie was simply being true to the book - but it seemed far-fetched.
0440246024|3.0|I didn't connect with any of the characters like I normally do in a Grisham book. I am a big fan of his and let's be upfront here, I feel he is one of the best writers around.  The book centers around a young newspaper editor in Clanton, Mississippi during the 1970's. Rather than a murder mystery or a legal suspense book, it is a story about a small southern town dealing with the issues of the day, including Vietnam and desegregation. The murder and trial are only a very small part of the actual plot. Don't expect to have a big surprise at the end. It wasn't a bad book for me but it wasn't the legal thriller I was looking for either.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Jane Eyre has always been one of my favorite books, and this version is great. The actors in it are great especially ruth wilson and toby stephens. He's amazing as rochester, he plays him so naturally, and ruth is wonderful as jane. This version is also more indepth compared to others since it's a mini series, so there's no real limit on time.

0199659257|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1SHEZU3W8V5CE]]<br />A PRACTICAL AND WIDE-RANGING APPROACH TO INTERNATIONAL CHARITABLE GIVING<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Carol Bellamy (former Peace Corps head and executive director of UNICEF) points out in the foreword to this thought provoking book, that charitable giving, like commercial enterprise itself, has gone global.  `It is a cross-border phenomenon,' she adds, `with indigenous charities working with charities in other jurisdictions in the pursuit of common causes.'<br /><br />The book is particularly timely in view of the increasing concern that charitable funds - large donations in particular -- transferred across borders, could be diverted into criminal and/or terrorist hands.<br /><br />As the editors note, `the need for an understanding of the interaction of various legal systems in this field has grown considerably,' a need amply well addressed in this book.  Written for practitioners by practitioners, this volume is a compilation of learned articles and essays from over two dozen distinguished practitioners and experts from at least nineteen jurisdictions from around the world.<br /><br />Almost five-hundred pages in length, the book is divided into two parts.  The first is an overview of this wide-ranging subject, covering such topics as the practice of international philanthropy and tax treaties as well as issues relating to money laundering and terrorist financing and finally, the role of the offshore charity is examined.<br /><br />Part II -- approximately two-thirds of the book  -- concerns the law and practice of each of the nineteen jurisdictions mentioned above, from Belgium, Bermuda and Canada to Scotland, Switzerland and the US.  Additionally, there is a chapter on Islamic law and the modern Islamic world.<br /><br />Logically structured and copiously footnoted with extensive reading lists, the book is an authoritative and useful tool for researchers and certainly for practitioners involved in cross-border and global issues pertaining to charitable giving on the part of high net-worth individuals or organizations.<br /><br />As you would expect from a book of this scope and stature, there are extensive tables of cases and legislation, as well as a table of international treaties conventions and agreements.  The detailed index at the back makes it much easier for the hard-pressed practitioner to look things up.<br /><br />The editors and the individual contributors have collaborated to produce an accessible, reliable and up-to-date work of reference which will prove indispensable to professionals requiring an international perspective in this often misunderstood area of law.  The publication date is cited as at August 2012.ers and certainly for practitioners involved in cross-border and global issues pertaining to charitable giving on the part of high net-worth individuals or organizations.<br /><br />As you would expect from a book of this scope and stature, there are extensive tables of cases and legislation, as well as a table of international treaties conventions and agreements.

B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I put this on over my front door, under the overhang, about 3 months ago. It only comes on when it's dark which really saves on battery life. It's not as bright as even a 25 watt bulb, but when it's dark your eyes don't need that much light to see what you're doing. What's nice is if someone steps on the porch after dark I can see who it is out the kitchen window; before I couldn't see.
B0036XN2L2|3.0|This pains me to write because I absolutely love the Scorpions but this CD is just OK. I love the band and I will argue with anyone that Blackout is a metal masterpiece but there is some ingredient missing on this - whether it is a producer, original member, or what I don't know but it is just so so.
B000002NJS|5.0|This has to be the best work Madonna has delivered. Something changed after the birth of her first child and the timing of the release of this album was nothing short of perfect. Madonna has said herself that she finds it difficult to choose singles for every album she's released but whoever decided that \\"Frozen\\" would be the first single from this album, made a brilliant decision. There's no doubt that Madonna and William Orbit make beautiful music together. The remixes William made for Madonna prior to this album were fantastic but there is something so stunning and panoramic about this album that makes me visualise each track as though I was watching it unfold on a screen, like a film. The vocals are soothing and captivating. Nothing here is rushed, Madonna sounds patient. This is music you can listen to and relax (or dance if the mood takes you). Standout tracks are \\"Power Of Goodbye\\", \\"Frozen\\", \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"To Have And Not To Hold\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\". The writers (including Rick Nowels) have created majestic songs that stand the test of time and Madonna sounds as though she swallowed a jar of honey before recording. All the vocal training prior to \\"Evita\\" is evident. What a wonderful voice, what a brilliantly created atmosphere. This flows like the wind. There's nothing staccato. Even the artwork is beautiful, the most natural Madonna has ever looked since \\"Like A Prayer\\". Put away all your fears and sit down with a cup of tea and be taken to a place far away, where life is magical for almost 70 minutes. You'll love this.<br /><br />Buy this, you won't regret it!
B0086QS7N2|4.0|I'm not going to bother comparing this album to 2112 or Moving Pictures because that's not fair and I'm just happy that one of rock's best and most original bands is still making good music. If you're not a Rush fan this probably won't win you over but you are a Rush fan just sit back, slip on the headphones and listen to some of the most talented musician's that played rock.

B005OT2YVA|1.0|This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. This film is too dumb for adults and way to crass for children. I don't know who's giving the good reviews, it must be highly paid movie industry workers. This movie is really, really bad!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie! Good story line and good acting. Definitely recommend it. Good date night movie. I would watch it again.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Without Meryl Steep, this would have been a total flop. We kept waiting for the action to pickup, one of the worst movies I've seen in sometime.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|This was a very well made app. I'm was saving up for paint tool sai , so having this till then was fantastic. There were some glitches here and there,but beyond that it was a good app. I enjoyed the arm rest feature so my hand could touch the screen without interference. Saved me the trouble of wearing gloves while drawing.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I've seen bits and pieces of this movie countless times. It's great, and kids seem to love it. My wife also loves it... She gravitates toward LOTR and such things, so if you're a fan of fantasy that might help.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I love this album!  It's unique and engaging.  And I love Ellie's voice - it's completely different and has a sort of eerie feeling.  GREAT!
B0054SMID0|3.0|This movie isn't the worst I've ever seen. The plot is a bit trite and the acting is tiresome and mediocre at best. The only upside is that I watched the movie from beginning to end with less than five interruptions of various lengths.  Considering my first attempt to watch the movie failed completely after the first 15 minutes, I believe this go around was moderately successful. It seems that my Shockwave Player (adobe) plug in needed updating (I'm on a Mac). Once I did that, I got through the entire movie with only a few connection hiccups. I recommend checking that you have the newest version of the Adobe Shockwave Player installed and updated before using this service.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Another great album from Lana!  Seriously, I just love her.  She has this kind of bad girl 60s vibe going on...and obviously a fantastic voice!  I'm constantly introducing people to her music because she deserves more recognition!
B004OZZ624|4.0|Would I call this an edge-of-your-seat nail biter? No. I will call it an effective suspense movie that doesn't go overboard with high-flying ninja kicks and cartoonish action scenes. The acting is decent for the most part but I found Elizabeth Banks a bit stiff and an overall unsympathetic character. That was possibly intentional but when you examine the opening scene, her character remarkably embodies the classic supermom persona - she's all things to everyone with some virtue, spunk and naivete thrown in for good measure. The film does well to explore some of the moral grey areas that envelop this scenario but it's topical and barely skims the surface. Russell Crowe's performance is solid but I would have loved to see more of Brian Dennehy in this film...he is a powerhouse performer but his role is very peripheral here. This film could have easily gone with a less predictable ending but we are inevitably left rooting for the main characters, in spite of the stone-faced Banks and often deadpan Crowe. Worth the watch but don't expect too much food for thought.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is easily one of the best games I have ever played. You have a fun while killing monsters but you have to stay low for some time until you level up. The game provides you with the best way to explore arenas  and kill monsters. The multiplayer mode is also fun.

B000J5XS3C|5.0|For what this does you can't go wrong for the price!  I have a small recording setup and play guitar (and bass) with friends.  This little mixer gets both of those jobs done right.  Sure a more expensive mixer might be able to tweek your vocals or instruments more, but all I needed was a way to mix up to 4 inputs at at time and out put to my speakers and laptop for recording.  It does all of those jobs well. There is no hum when the unit is on.  I have two small grips though..and they are minor...the EQ isn't that great and the volume to the headphones is lower than I like.  Maybe I'm going deaf.
B005DNOAQY|5.0|What a wonderful movie this is! My family loved watching it. I love Bogey movies and Woody Allen's satire is beautifully done. The person doing the Bogey impersonations was amazing. Diane Keaton was her usual self (a real pro) but Woody Allen stole the show, of course. The story was enjoyable even though the ending was fairly predictable. The dialogue was witty and Allen's moments of physical comedy were hilarious (especially the bathroom scene with the hair dryer). A charmer.

B009CGYO0K|4.0|Quick, fun read for cat owners. I thoroughly enjoyed it's humor and accuracy. I would recommend this book to anyone who had has a cat.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Simply amazing. A remarkable ending to a superb first book. Unexpected twists and turns keep you reading on. A must read for teens.
034580404X|5.0|I loved every bit of it, the love, the story line, the passion and excitement I was not bored and it is great read on the plane, bus or just to past time
B008NABUU8|3.0|The controls are a bit frustrating, always grabbing things I didn't want to so it can be frustrating. If you have patience you can have fun with this game,  hey it was free what can you expect?  I do wish there were more games like this out there.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|it's a great hidden object game to me. But it's scary at parts it me crap my pants. I need new pants now.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Only had a couple of opportunities to use the product but it sure has made file transfers and copying easier.  Especially since it its all handled wirelessly
B0001FYPZU|1.0|Meet Me in St. Louis [region2-pal]  I can't watch this DVD!!! You tell me why!! What does Region mean!!!! thanks
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this works great for me. its handy and I always have it with me. its large enough to be easily read and is in general a berry useful tool to have.
0307895475|5.0|This is one of the best strategy guide that I have ever seen. There is a lot of content for the price, and that content is highly detailed and beautifully made. The only problems that I have with this product is that it was improperly packaged and it arrived with the corners bent on the first few pages; the map of skyrim that is included was difficult to tear out without tearing the map itself; also, it should be noted that this version of the guide does not include the Dragonborn add on, only Dawngaurd and Hearthfire, so it might be worth waiting to see if they come out with another revised copy which includes Dragonborn. Other than that, this strategy guide is absolutely perfect. There is an overwhelming amount of content, and it is organized in a clear and simple format. Skyrim is one of the few games that are worth buying a strategy guide for because of its immense, complex, and sophisticated gameplay. This guide will definitely help you on just about any subject in the game. 5 STARS!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Don't waste your money on the cheap knockoffs!<br /><br />Feels just like the original, maybe because it's made by the original.<br /><br />Our kids fight over who gets to use THIS controller and the loser gets to use the GameStop brand.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Seriously...the funniest book ever written.  That is, if you like Tina Fey's humor. I sat down on a Sunday afternoon and laughed/cried my way through the entire thing.  I may even read it again. And I never read a book more than once.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Although it is a good read, The Innocent is not as gripping as David Baldacci novels that I have previously read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book I've read in a while. I couldn't put it down. This is a must read!! I wouldn't hesitate to read this book because it is so amazing.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Short every time I get on it closes the app at first it worked now it doesn't so this is horrible to me
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|nicely produced and executed, still closely tied with Bourne franchise. It could benefit from a better profiling of the new story.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Loved the book...very funny Ellen is such an inspiration...<br />Everyone should read this book...lots of laughing while readi this ...yay Ellen
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Everything about this book was fantastic. I didn't want it to end, but I'm so glad I got the chance to read it. I will definitely be looking at life a little differently from now on.
B007EC27QM|5.0|so ez to use and realy smart with numbers it is. some times I don't even puts numbers in and it has the asnswer already for me's. amassing
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Again, it was a wonderful show.  Only wish now is that it is brought to the stage in the US.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A very enjoyable read for those of you who like a blend of fantasy and reality. Well written, characters have a real depth , original idea and some suspense. My only &#34;critisism&#34;  : it's too short !
B007R21JJK|5.0|works like a dream, running two SSD drives, one HD, Intel Core i5-3570K Quad-Core Processor, EVGA GeForce GTX 660 SUPERCLOCKED 2048MB GDDR5, Antec Kuhler H2O 620 Liquid CPU Cooler, Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1600 MHz , Cooler Master Elite 430 - Mid Tower Computer Case with All-Black
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app.  I was unable to use my kindle for listening to local public radio.  this app works great and give numerous options
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|The reason for the rating is two-fold. The Blu-ray edition is stunning. The visuals from the dirt on Ahsoka's face to the space battles are amazing. Second, the story is very good and makes me think this is what the prequel trilogies should have been.<br />The voice acting is very close to the live-action actors and maintains the suspension of disbelief.<br />A worthwhile addition to every Stars Wars collection and if you are like me will watch it more often than Episode I.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|In my family, we are basically Les Mis obsessed. So, needless to say, when the movie came out, we were thrilled, and immediately bought the soundtrack. We love it!! The voices are perfect. Anne Hathway's \\"I dreamed a dream\\", Samantha Barks' \\"On my own\\", and Hugh Jackman's \\"Valjean's Soliloqy\\" are fabulous. All of the tracks are spot on. \\"Epilogue\\" more specifically the end, \\"Do you hear the people sing\\" is probably the most rousing song in the movie. However, since it's only highlights, they are definitely missing some good songs. Such as \\"A little fall of rain\\" which I sincerely miss. Unfortunately, it looks like we aren't going to get a full soundtrack at this point...I would give it 5 stars for the quality but I still think the full soundtrack would have been better. If you're looking to buy, I can give a hearty go ahead!
B0063GORYU|5.0|easy to download, graphics clear, have to think and strategize to improve score and time, yet each game takes only a few minutes...addictive!
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Have watched the blue-ray version several times. Suddenly the disc started sticking at the beginning of the movie. The odd thing is that only the visual portion is stuck. The audio continues to play while the visual is stuck at the beginning of the movie . Not impressed !
B009KHDT0C|4.0|like Johnny Depp he was cute in this show it was just not long enough would have loved it longer
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Easy and fun you will love playing with it for hour after hour<br /> Great adiction. Kids or adults can play and enjoy the fun cjallamges
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I had saw two of the chew crew say they loved this so I  checked it out now I am in love with the sho
0143116738|1.0|The book could be summarized in a few sentences. It has no practical application of the principle \\"follow your passion\\". I do not recommend to read beyond chapter 1 or 2.
B00005JKGK|4.0|I purchased this movie for my mother and she loves this movie. She talked about so much that I purchased it for her.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|Not fun . Could not figure out. My daughter got frustrated after 2 minutes of trying to figure out how to play
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I love this movie better than the first Sherlock. This movie had more action and comedy then the first movie.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Sleek, modern, clear, exact, direct and comprehensive. Hmm.. Anymore synonyms? Basically, I love flipping the board back and forth between articles and networks. It's organized precisely and easy to use.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I love this movie. I think Robert Downey Jr and his side kick are very funny. I would recommend this movie.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Cute game.  Interesting enough to be entertaining.  Inspires creativity mixed with logic.  Simple to use, you don't have to be an artist to play.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Seasoned actors made this movie very entertaining and something that couples 50 and above can relate to. My wife and I enjoyed it.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Good app.  The game has a pretty good learing curve to master, but it is easily playable from the start.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Once what was an excellent and elegant app is now over-engineered with features that suck up process time, are of questionable value and impairs function. Now loaded with ads, it's a poster child of a good app gone sour... a classic case of greed gone wild. Any number of other Android file managers are now superior to this piece of junk and it's why I keep backups to older version apps before replacing them.<br /><br />By the way, if you try to replace this app with an older, superior version, it says the older file is &#34;corrupted&#34; and won't install. It's not. Remove the new version completely before installing the backup and disable the auto-update in &#34;options&#34;.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Kit comes with instructions on how to build multiple projects.  My daughter has built them all and loves coming up with her own!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I love British period dramas and this revival of the series does not disappoint.  I own the complete set of DVDs for the original Upstairs Downstairs series and I enjoyed watching this one.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|I remember playing this on my Dreamcast back in the day! It's a good puzzle game where you place arrows (a limited amount) to direct the constantly moving mice to get them past the cats and in to the rockets. (Yeah, it's definitely a SEGA game!) I like that it ported over so well, and in fact many games from Sega and Nintendo are perfect for touch screen gaming. I wish more puzzle games were being ported instead of some of the FPS games (which I love, but are hard to control with the limited inputs on the screen.)<br /><br />Even though it's a very good port, I rated three because it just isn't that great of a game. I remember getting bored of this game in the mid 90s and I got bored again after a few rounds. The multiplayer is missing so there isn't much going on here to hold your attention for more than a few hours. Good port. OK game.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I love this game, but my only complaint is that pop ups appear after I have finished my game.  That is why I rated it only 3.
B009IA9OLE|4.0|In this game you take on the role of an 80s lawyer, appropriately devoid of morals, to free criminals through a turn based, life point system with attacks. Similar to an RPG with each character having life points, attack points and special powers. You have attacks that either limit the prosecutor's attacks, special powers, or beat (remove from the game) evidence or witnesses. It's a faily complex game that you'll pick up right away and spend hours trying to master.<br /><br />What I liked: I love the turn based strategy attack/defend aspects. I love that your character earns different power ups and new attacks based on what you buy for him (either in his home or wardrobe). I love the banter between the lawyers and trying to figure out who these characters are based on from the 80s. This game has style and replayability that is rare in an Android game.<br /><br />What I didn't like: you can't lose. If you lose a case you simply retry with no penalty. You can't level up all skills. While that adds to replayability, it can be frustrating because you don't know how important certain paths are until after you make them. There isn't a lot of customizing the game flow. You will play one case after another with little variation. I'd like to see a goal at the start with multiple endings where you can make it or not. It would be more rewarding.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent game that is exceedingly well made that is fun, complex and replayable. Very good job!
B000GIXIBY|5.0|There is nothing at all wrong with this movie. Highly entertaining, with dozens of quotable lines. Buy it and watch it many times. That is all.
B009CG29RK|5.0|Very clever and funny movie the whole family can enjoy even after my daughter had made me watch it over 400 times. Piranha Gun, Oh Yeaaah!!!!
B005LAIGRS|4.0|We were happy to add this movie to our Denzel Washington collection. We found the storyline a little painful.  It's not a pretty movie, and the 'good guy'; and 'bad guy' lines are at times blurred.  Yet, it's gritty presentation seems probably more real than we'd like to admit.  All in all, it kept me guessing a few times and provided thought-provoking entertainment.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|By the time you are in the third book, you have to find out how the main character is going to resolve all of his issue based on his tragic past.  You've been seeing him make slow steps in his recognition of his ties from the past to the present, but he is thoroughly being challenged in this book to pull it all together.  I particularly liked the last chapter that goes back to what  the main character, Christian,  was truly thinking when he first met Anastasia, his perspective, not hers.  Very interesting.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy the hidden object games. I only wish they would have more time and objects per round. Easier to open more rooms would be great too.
0515141429|5.0|This book had me hooked by the very first sentence. I couldn't put this book down. It had great characters and a very intriguing plot.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book so much, it's a truly great book. I hope to see more from this author. Great job.
B000SGSU58|3.0|It was ok. I think the court scene was too drawn out and could have concentrated on the crimes more.
0802473156|5.0|I've read this book before, but ordered it as a gift.  Highly recommend this book for any type of relationship, strong or having troubles.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great! This product was exactly what I expected. It was funny and my family enjoyed it. It didn't take long to download. I would recommend this product.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was unsure about this book when I first started reading it. It is a little graphic when it comes to the sex, but really once you look past all of that its just a fantasic love story. I am looking forward to it becoming a movie!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|This series of books is amazing! Very INTENSE and not for everyone.  I was hooked right in the beginning. I love the characters.  I'm so disappointed there will never be another book, as Stieg Larsson has passed away.
0316017930|5.0|This book made me look at the world differently and provides a fundamental base from which I derive many of my political views.
B004LWZWC4|5.0|MY HUSBAND LIKES THIS MOVIE, NOT ONLY FOR THE STORY, WHICH IS CUTE, BUT FOR THE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY. I RECOMMEND IT.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've been a fan of Angry Birds for a while now. It's highly addictive and fun. I love, love, love bashing piggies with birds! I'm so glad to have it on my Kindle Fire now. And free! It doesn't get any better than that.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|bought this because the ads on the free version were getting increasingly invasive and offensive. now that I've used this one, I wish I upgraded a year ago; app is fast, sharp, great use of screen space, and many options to customize to your taste. fantastic for only 99 cents.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show so very much. It is full of action, suspense and drama. It truly keeps me on my toes and leaves me HUNGRY for another episode as soon as I finish one. I Love this show and hope it never ends!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had been looking for something like this game for a while now. I can play this while my daughter is sleeping in her hospital bed and I am not spending real money.
0062082353|5.0|Very enjoyable also like the part from the wife's point of view.  A book that can be read again and still get more out of it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I would recommend this app for anyone who needs a quick working calculator.Very useful in all sorts of math situations
B004WDRT1Y|1.0|While watching Lion King 3D, I was amazed that it appeared more like a 2D DVD so I took off my Sony 3D glasses and was amazed to see that some of the scenes were 3D while most of the scenes were 2D.  This was made 3D cheap...avoid this 3D video its not worth the money!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|There were a few funny parts to this movie.  I don't think it is for everyone as you have to think it is funny when people say narly stuff.
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|This movie had great potential, but for whatever reason, it just never really caught me up in the story.  I think the plot was just too contrived and the characters underdeveloped.  It just goes to show you what happens when your story isn't right on target.  Not a bad movie, but I won't probably watch it again.
0962477060|5.0|If you really want to understand how scales, chords  and progressions emerge from the fretboard get tis study book.  It is user friendly, systematic, and eminently practical.  It will change your understand of the guitar overnight and forever!  If you only afford one book, buy this one.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I think you definitely have to be older to appreciate this movie.  There were several times when I found myself laughing at loud uncontrollably.  It's well acted, and it's nice to see a movie with substance rather than a movie where an actresses sex appeal, cleavage, and butt are suppose to carry the story....although - I thought both Streep and Jones were sexy for their age!
B000YHG72E|5.0|We will watch this every year now.  What a super funny movie!  Safe for kids as well with little inuendo or violence.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|This was a good book and easy reading but I was not thrilled with the character of Theodore Boone.  I was not that impressed but maybe others would be.
B0031QVW2U|5.0|My Black Rapid RS-5 camera strap is awesome... BUT, it slides all over the place when i'm shooting and that can really get you into trouble if it slides the wrong way and you quickly try to pull your camera up to shoot!  Once i installed the RMA-10B Brad on my strap, problem solved.  The strap now doesn't budge at all.  If you have trouble with the strap sliding, this is the fix.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Bought two,of these as cheap gifts for family guys and was surprised in how nice they are. Would get again.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|this movie is an ambonation to horror and extreme film, it is like a nightmare coming true before your eyes nothing i have seen before have brought out the same emotions this thing did, it made me want to throw up literally bad to be a gorehound like the ultimate vouyeur, nothing can prepare you for this film, it was an amazing experiance and the brother of milo is truly a bird dog, the little girl who needs a filling, the women beat to death, the baby, but what i saw was the worst was the ending what a cold heartless ending, if you just like regular horror movies do not watch this, this is only for the big boys to watch, it is also an art masterpiece and the best of the extreme films. none the less i hate this film i want to burn it for the hell it is thank you good bye
1419705849|5.0|We have purchased all of this series so far for our son and he has enjoyed each one. Waiting on the next.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved this book! The moment I started reading this book i couldnt put it down. Its a tragic love story, and it's heart breaking. Jodi did a great job in putting this book together. I would have loved a better ending to this story, like it need a little more to it, but other than that Jodi has the reader so caught up in the story that you cant put it down.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Not what I expected...I thought the book was okay, but the book was somwhat interesting. I hate to say it, but I would not recommend this book.
0670026603|5.0|This story is a poignant heartbreaking story of the unlikely pairing of two people that otherwise would have never met.  First you meet Will Traynor the man's man, a guy that has the world at his feet. He is successful, adventurous, loving life and living it to it's fullest. But one day tragedy strikes and Will's life is changed forever and he is now in a wheelchair and has to depend on others.<br />Louisa is hired as his caregiver and they start out with Will being bitter with his circumstances, but Louisa sets out to show him how life can be good even though life for him is different now different.<br /><br />This story is wonderfully written and I could not put it down until I finished it.<br /><br />I received this book for an honest review.
1401322786|5.0|Have started to read the book, it is enjoyable to read.  But I like all of mitch books he has put out.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferris has again delivered a masterful compilation of hands on learning that is worth far more than the price of the book. As with &#34;The 4 Hour Body&#34;, I will find myself referencing back to the book time and time again to review and practice the broad scope of acquirable skills. His explanation and practice of the &#34;80/20&#34; rule of learning has already impacted my development of new skill sets and allowed me to grasp previously difficult challenges.<br />As with his previous works, I have found myself engrossed in topics I previously would have had no interest in. I may never need a lot of the skills he presents, but it is nice knowing they are in reach if I do need to call upon them.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I thought the book was poorly written , the story was weak and pointless.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a Great app I love the fact you can set it at certain % to wort you. and tells you when the divice is fully charged instead of wondering if when it looks like its charged, is it completely? no questions with this little app. its awesome its free too!
1451695195|5.0|This account of  NDE was rather different from others I've read.  He gave a much more descriptive account of the good and awful events than other authors.  Others have been about the peace and beauty, but not the struggle to find himself and not seeing anyone he recognized.  A wonderfully crafted story.  I did get a bit lost in the technical explanation for what had happened to his brain.  I will never sit by another person who is in a coma without holding their hand
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Good for adults who love drama, history, and philosophy.<br />The script is remarkable. The costuming and scenery is amazing.<br />It will be a classic one day... I have already rewatched the series several times. And each time, I find something new that I hadn't caught before.<br />(Very little profanity and sexually explicate scenes.)<br />Definitely worth the money!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A fun read and a real page turner. Post apocalyptic without the zombies:) Same genre as \\"Year of the Flood\\" and \\"Oryx and Crake\\".
0385535147|5.0|pretty good nd loved that you were kept guessing until the end 0f course I love anything John writes--he is always sooo good
B00064X3KO|5.0|Very good purchase!!!! Jamie Cullum is a perfect singer for who loves jazz and pop music at the same time. Many songs, all of them wonderful! Definitely one of the best CD's that I have!
0525425764|4.0|I read everything John Grisham writes even if it is written for younth--so enjoyed the kid lawyer and think any John Grisham fam would like it
B000HKW7E0|4.0|This is a movie everyone should watch at Christmas. So many good one liners in it. Watching Clark loose his mind is fantastic!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Standard Gresham novel, could have phoned it in.<br />Still worth reading to the end though,there's a twist in the tail.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. I don't want to give any spoilers. The only thing I can say is I wish there was more to the ending instead of leaving you to wonder about some of the characters. I can't wait to read book 3 even though the reviews don't seem that great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun and still more fun when you are by yourself.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|The in app support doesn't work it just says I have symbols in my body of letters when I have none and when I go to take a video it doesn't work and it slowed my kindle down so badly I had to restart it and uninstall the app screw this app
B009HEJXFS|3.0|My family and I always enjoy the MIB movies, so we had to watch MIB3 of course.<br /><br />In watching it two times, I got really sleepy on both occasions which is really unusual. I found there to be about 30-45 minutes of material that was just boring and disappointing.<br /><br />If this is a must have on your library list, you might want to rent it first and save some money. I own the first two, but I don't think I will buy this one on disk until it's on sale for $5.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|I love Lost Girl.  I really wanted a good 1080p copy, after Syfy HD spoiled me.  Also, I really was annoyed with Syfy's BS editing, so you gotta get the whole thing and you can get the whole thing here!<br /><br />I'll update after viewing features.  It is nice having one of my ships be canon (Doccubus).  Looking forward to Season 3.  2013, yum.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|This is a cute kids movie that adults can watch.  It is from Disney, what more do you need to know?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm allways buying new apps because I get bored. I don't do that any more. Also there's a game for everyone!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It left me hanging at the end of the movie. Maybe there will be another one?? The action was still pretty good compare to the 3 before it.
1934030597|5.0|Purchased this along with the Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance & Repair; for Road bikes.  Good reference material putting a different slant on it from a MTB standpoint.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved this book.  The story of Sky and Holder is not an easy, run of the mill love story.  It is a deep, gut-wrenching, soul-searching type of love story. I love Colleen Hoover and her amazing ability to write amazing stories, but she outdid herself this time.  The story slowly unravels and you discover the past of Holder and Sky and realize they are destined to be together.  I would recommend this book to anybody.  You won't be sorry. A very easy read, but be prepared you will cry!
0811879631|5.0|Bought this for a friend.. looked at it for hours! It's full of amazing art from all the pixar movies that you'd never get to see anywhere else. Well worth the money if you love the movies and enjoy storyboard art.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|me and my mom have been elvis fans for a looooong time, so imagine how thrilled we were with this cd- some of his greats (which we love) but many which we had never heard of before. it was like he just released a new cd just for us :)<br /><br />many people like his earlier works better but my mom and i are particular fans of some of his later things. suspicious minds, in the ghetto, etc. this entire cd really has the sound like those 2 songs and are fresh and new for us. if you are a true elvis fan and not just someone who likes to sing along to his most popular songs, then you will love this!!!<br /><br />the selection of songs is great, the insert and info was really interesting and having songs which arent mainstream-elvis mixed in with some that have become such classic was nice. his voice was amazing as always and the less known songs doesnt mean they are any less great. i especially enjoyed \\"who am i\\" to me, elvis never sounded as peaceful as when he sang a gospel song.<br /><br />overall, we were really pleased with this and enjoyed it just as much as we have any other elvis album. i would recommend this to any other elvis fans out there. if you're just starting to listen to elvis, i recommend one of his greatest hits albums. the Elvis 30 #1 hits album in particular is a favorite and has a great number of songs on it!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00006AG5N 30 #1 Hits]]<br /><br />we sure do miss this great artist!!
B008TRUDAS|1.0|I purchased ebook online largely due to the number of reviews and its rating.  Most books purchased this way were decent to great reads, and this book was extremely disappointing.  I forced myself to read to the middle of the book, flipped to near the end, and was in disbelief that is all it had to offer.  Perhaps the books were geared toward young adults, so the reading level was quite simple (it was not a literary work).  There was nothing original about the plot, although at time I am just so surprised that the main character is such a selfish brat.<br />Spoiler ahead....<br />She has just found out that her mom has cancer, and the first thing she does is to run to a boy that she has a crush on, pour her heart out to him, and only do the 'right' thing when he told her to do, because everything he does is right.  I hate to believe that this is what we are aspiring our kids to become.<br />I was so shock by how ridiculous this story has become.  I started to read the 5-stars and 1 star reviews.  I think a huge chunk of the 5-stars must be fake.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Does everything I need it to, used on galaxy s3 and kindle fire hd. Haven't had any issues at all.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Love this CD. The music is beautiful and brings the books to life. I listen while I am in traffic for stress relief.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The app works well. Facebook is there to check in on the universe because we are all busy folks without a ton of time . for connection ...so it aids in the speed with which you keep in touch.
B005T87QCI|1.0|it's a real pitty because this game has magnificent graphics, but the nonresponsive tiny control buttons makes it a very frustrating experience trying to play the game.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What was a simple suggestion from a hairdresser (to collect images  of hair color) became quite a fun past time and a used tool in many aspects of life. You make boards that have visuals of things that please you...then take it out into the world and plunder!
B0055SJVPW|5.0|This was a gift for my wife.  We have not viewed it yet.  It arrived in great shape.  Thank you.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So good I'm ready for the next. Cannot wait to get started. I just can't put these books down. Bring it on.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Nearing the end of listening(about now) trying not to bawl-failing miserably.<br />Okay. The reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is A)Because quite a few songs from the movie are not including*cough*a little fall of rain*cough* B) Master of The House is too annoying to even consider liking.<br />I loved the movie. And I REALLY like how I feel like I'm back in the theater watching the film all over again while listening to this. Anne Hathaway,Hugh Jackman=Brilliant. And I think Russell Crowe isn't exactly hard to listen to in this. Amanda Seyfried is really high(like soprano,high) at parts.Eddie Redmayne is pretty darn brilliant,too.<br />I really like how so many Broadway players were cast in this.It helps perfect it,in my opinion.<br /><br />Song by song:<br />Look Down-Choppy and cut too short from (film)recording.<br />The Bishop-Really good<br />Valjean's Soliloquy-Jackman does extremely well in portraying Valjean's emotions in this ranging from remorse to Determination<br />At The End of the Day-Feels like watching an(meaning a musical-esque ensemble)ensemble sing it<br />I Dreamed A Dream-First thing's first.Susan Boyle eat your heart out-in my opinion Anne's version is about one million times better. Okay, now that's out of my system. Definitely a tearjearker.My only complaint is that the beginning of the song is too quiet-I had to turn my volume up to be able to hear it well enough.<br />The Confrontation-Good.<br />Castle on a cloud-Beautiful and heartbreaking.Isn't necessarily a tearjerker but still a beautiful song.<br />Master of the House-Too annoying for words. If I never have to hear it again-I'll be extremely happy.<br />Suddenly-Shocked this isn't in the musical(original to the movie).It is the perfect display of Valjean's emotions after taking Cosette into his care.<br />Stars-A favorite. Crowe does an excellent job in portraying Javert's determination to find and Capture Valjean.<br />Abc Cafe/Red and Black-Good. A song that parallels the boys going to revolution against the government and Marius's being in love with Cosette.<br />In My Life/A Heart Full of Love-Good song. I think my fave part is Eponine's.<br />On My Own-One of my faves. About how Eponine loves Marius but all he see/loves is Cosette.<br />One Day More-Depicts the preparation for war/Valjean's running away in order to protect Cosette.<br />Drink with me-Sort of a one last hurrah for the boys before going to war.<br />Bring Him Home-Another really good song. Valjean sees how much Marius loves Cosette and begs god to take him instead.<br />The Final Battle-Pretty self explanatory.<br />Javert's suicide-A fave. Javert is conflicted because Valjean has just spared his life.<br />Empty Chairs at Empty Tables-Marius mourns for his friends.<br />Epilogue-A fave. Pretty self explanatory.
0307744434|5.0|If you read a book for simple pleasure, this book is for you. If you read a book for its excellent writting, this book is definately for you!<br />I agree with another reviewer in sayiing this book is not for every reader, but if you recognize great writing when you find it, you will want to read Night Circus for that reason alone.<br />Night Circus is a love story, but not a romance novel. Its a who-done-it, but not a mystery. Its about magic but not sorcery or witch craft. Definately not a \\"fluff\\" book because you will want to re-read lines to savor the writing. Not a \\"beach read\\" because you will get sunburn.<br />I would put it down to do something else but was unable to stop wondering what would happen next and which character it would happen to. It will draw you back as if you were under the spell of the book. If you've ever felt that your life was spinning out of control, or out of your hands, you will sympathize with all of the characters in Night Circus and be very pleased with its (only) logical ending where everyone finds some happiness and control over their lives.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|A JOY AND PLEASE FOR THE HOLIDAY LISTENING.  I LOVE ROD'S VOICE AND THIS WAS NO EXCEPTION.<br /><br />ALSO PURCHASED THE LOVE SONGS OF 40''S AND ENJOYING IT TOO.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|As advertised. New, great sounds and service. Only hassle is having to write too many words for the review.<br />1 more word required.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I FOLLOWED PHILLIP PHILLIPS ON AMERICAN IDOL AND WAS AMAZED BY HIS TALENT.  I WAITED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY HIS ALBLUM.  I PLAN TO PURCHASE MORE OF HIS MUSIC IN THE FUTURE.  LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IS GROWTH AND SUCCESS IN THE INDUSTRY AS TIME GOES BY.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't ever but the book down. The author writes it so well, I recommend this to anybody in at least high school.
B002EEP3NO|4.0|\\"Santa\\" bought this set for my 5 and half year old and so far so good. Took my husband 20 hours to build. My son tried his best to help but it's obviously intended for older children. Worth the $360+ price tag, yes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is going to leave you hanging onto every last word- you won't be able to put it down! I can't wait to immediately begin reading book number two! Suzanne Collins really did a spectacular job. Katniss and Peeta's relationship has me over the moon!
B008VVT51U|5.0|This was the best movie I have ever seen. I just loved it. Every second of it. It was inspirational and funny. A must see for everyone
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It wouldn't seem like Christmas if I did not get to watch this movie!I know people can hear me laughing outside....................
B0064W639K|5.0|I recommend it if your a Batman fan or crime drama fan or even both I give this story 5 stars for a well deserved reason.
0316232955|5.0|I am a huge Chris colder fan. And this book is so good! I can't wait to see the movie!!!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I thought diary of a Wimpy Kid dog days was an excellent book and I liked when Greg rode the cranium shaker.
0316123587|3.0|Well I'm kinda disappointed. Just all the picture that I saw most of them. And I'm a huge klanie fan, there s not that much about them :/
B002JWD6AS|5.0|One of my good friends had recommended this for me, and i think it's one of the best books I've ever read! I'm actually already almost done with the series aha. If you like romance, suspense, and action, then this book is for you.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The music is amazing. I enjoy it a lot. It is worth to buy the music and listen every day.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really liked this book, actually its probably my favorite book ive read so far.  I liked the joke about the unemployment line in wv even tho i live in wv
B0086700CM|3.0|It is a very fun game but right in the middle of running the game Will not interact with my device so I can collect coins.
B0095T3H2U|3.0|If I could I would give  3.5 stars.  got a little long and predictable. it annoys me when people make obvious stupid decisions
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the BEST BOOK EVER .I really hope the movie will<br />Come out soon.This book is made for people with humor and<br />I am one of those people. If I could, I would rate It for 1,000!!
B005LAII80|5.0|We should all thank Batman Begins for clearing out all the stupid Cartoony, tough-guy with comic partner, style comic book movies. Comics are stories. Some are for adults, some are for kids. Not ALL are for kids.<br />This movie was a well made science fiction action feast. Even my friends who never read the comic, loved it. If you liked Batman Begins, Looper, LockOut, or even Escape from New York, then you'll love this.<br />This is a film that's about the STORY, and the action, not about the famous actor (like the first one), and there are some CRAZY FX shots in here. the slow-motion bullet hits are nuts.<br />Watch this. You'll love it.<br />I really hope they make a sequel.
B000GCFG7E|3.0|Book was well writen.  The only problem I had with it and it may sound crazy but Recher needed a change of clothes and underware.  I found him a little discussing.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Enjoyable story.  I recommend reading all 5 stories at one time, so the omnibus edition was great for me.  Up and coming writer!
B006BAEQB2|1.0|I don't know why everyone is praising this book because as a constant reader This book is boring.  The author repeats herself and repeats, and repeats, over and over again.  It appeared that she didn't have to much to write about so she repeated herself to fill up pages.  I got so fed up I almost threw my kindle across the room.  TWO THUMBS DOWN.....poor writing.  I guess people wrote high praises ...like the empor with no clothes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There's been so much hype about the 'sex' in this series, but I have to point out there is so much more here.  I absolutely loved the story, and I have to admit I cried with each book. Yes, the sex is outstanding, but the whole story should be talked about.  One minute I wanted Christian Grey for my own, and the next I found I wanted to adopt him myself.  What a great author!  I'd love to read more like this. Please, keep them coming!
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I was happy to find the ending to Something Borrowed. I loved both books! I love the way everything ends up being just as it should!
1451695195|5.0|short and simple.. not too complicated in any areas.. one could tell he could take us into more scinetific areas but glad he didnt. He kept telling us in ways that are very precise and nort too laden with either science or a spirituality.. he saw and felt what he did and he conveyed it very well....
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It's a bit predictable but it is BEAUTIFUL. I cried a lot. I wasn't sure about reading this at first because I thought it'd be pretty cliche but it's one of the best books I've read in a while. ITS FANTASTIC.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I love this film as to how and what would occur if there was a drug out there that expanded our capacities... and just purchased the book as well.. wow it was based on a book, the authors first novel!!!
B008I34YYY|4.0|Keeping in mind what this movie is - a low budget thriller - its still a relatively good one.  Just don't expect a lot of wisdom or serious messages from this one.  It has reasonably good special effects and as expected it treats the &#34;Nazi&#34; bad guys as archetypal buffoons most of the time.  So - how did they get to the moon in 1945 anyhow??
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I play this game every chance I get. I wish the coins loaded faster, other than that this game is amazing!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Dark, brooding, mysterious.  I love that this series is not campy, but smart and entertaining and deep.  It seems so very real and I just get completely immersed in it.
B000EWBKK8|1.0|I got this 3 times in the mail, every time in skipped an froze in the same exact spots. they said it was a manufacturing era and refunded my money, but still have not got to watch it all the way thru
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This movie is fun as usual, but Josh Brolin's impression of tommy lee jones was just so dead on, it was the best part of the movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book,easy to read. Can read again at my leisure. Would recommend this book to other people. This book held my interest
B00APUYWYA|5.0|It's a formulaic story, but there are some hilarious moments and the performances are a lot of fun. It brought me back to my college days :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another good book to read. This book held my interest and was very exciting to read. Would recommend this book
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I cannot believe this movie!  It tries to teach kids that we should take care of the environment and treat ALL life with respect and compassion.  It tells kids we should not always put profit first and that we should try to be moral in our decision making.  How horrible and un-American!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Have read all three books and found them very good reading material. It is so easy to purchase online and read at my leisure. Book two was not as good as one and three
B007SGM084|2.0|Because of the hype I felt I had to read these books.  Must admit they did keep my interest to a point but, &#34;jeez&#34;, after a while the excessive sex just became boring.  &#34;Oh my&#34; I thought they were very poorly written.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game I play every day Very relaxing and a fun game. Don't win often on the first try but still fun to play
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved the book!!  My first Vince Flynn but will be reading more.  The story is so close to the things that are going on in the world today.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. Helps to keep my mind fresh. The grandchildren enjoy playing this game also. Good intertwinement
B008R5OJXE|5.0|Giulio Cesare has come a long way since the days when Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau recorded the title role under the heavy baton of Karl Richter and Beverly Sills did Cleopatra as if composed by Donizetti. After recording so many Handel operas, it was only right for Alan Curtis to take to the studio the greatest of all, and to me at least, it´s a success. What makes this new recording an essential purchase is Karina Gauvin´s incomparable singing as Cleopatra, none better since Tatiana Troyanos, certainly not Barbara Schlick, a late replacement in Rene Jacobs otherwise admirable Giulio Cesare, but a catastrophic miscast singer in this particular role. She is a fine oratorio singer, but as a sexy, seductive Egyptian queen she is a disaster.<br />Karina Gauvin, with her warm and gorgeous voice has every weapon for this taxing music, her bravura arias are brilliant, \\"Se pietá di me non senti\\" is exquisite, this lady was born to sing Handel. Magdalena Kozena in the Archiv recording is also very good and far superior to Schlick, but I think Gauvin is the more natural Handel soprano, and the more seductive too.<br />I have never been a great fan of Marie-Nicole Lemieux, but I actually liked her Cesare a lot, it´s commanding and vocally secure. Marijana Mijanovic in the Minkowski recording has more individuality, but there´s nothing to fault in Lemieux´s performance.<br />The one role where the Minkowski recording still reigns supreme is Sesto, with a singer of the caliber of Anne Sofie von Otter that is inevitable, but Curtis´ Emoke Barath is fine, she just lacks von Otter´s star quality individuality.<br />Il Complesso barocco plays superbly, as it does in Joyce DiDonato´s recent Drama Queen recital. Since Russian virtuoso Dmitry Sinkovsky became concertmaster, Il Complesso Barocco is now on the level of L´ Europa Galante and Il Giardino Armonico.<br />Every Giulio Cesare recording has something to offer, the Jacobs, the Petrou and the Minkowski are all excellent and have much to offer, but Karina Gauvin raises the temperature 5 degrees in the Curtis recording and that is why it´s now my preferred version.
B00APUQM3O|1.0|I have been trying desperately to watch \\"The Final Page\\" now that the chaos of Christmas is over. I have never purchased a video from here before, but everywhere I tried (including CBS.com which is normally free and perfect) all I was getting was a BLACK SCREEN. Well this is the same. And I'm highly annoyed. Amazon- please don't charge for something that doesn't work! I have tried it on every device I have and I continue to get nothing. I realize $1.99 isn't THAT expensive, but it's too expensive for things not to work. Can I get my money back???
B0090EKRKU|4.0|This was a great remake of this classic.  I rented for my 4 year old daughter and she loved it.
B000FC130E|5.0|This book was fabulous and a page turner. The only issue I have with it is that there are no more like it out there. No book compares or has even slightly the same plot.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I saw this movie a few weeks ago and I can say it did not leave a great impression on me.  I think it was just ok.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I purchased it on the kindle because the softcover was not yet out. To be honest though I plan on buying the entire game of thrones collection on the kindle. While I normally perfer to hold a book the Ice and Fire series is extremely heavy and causes tears in my purse. On the kindle I recieved it for a much cheaper price then the hardcover and it didn't cause my bag to rip at all.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This has been the best white noise app I've tried on my kindle fire.  Actually, I use the air conditioned or blue noise more than anything else.  I use it for sleep (as does my husband on his side of the bed), and for meditation!  Works great!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Her memoir is wonderful. It helps brighten any day and makes people laugh. This book helped me see how Tina Fey became the woman she is, it beautifully shows where she came from.
B004G6TD8Y|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite albums.  I was glad to find one for sale.  Play it loud!
B00A81MV3U|1.0|The movie version of Matthew Quick's book doesn't know where to find the balance. As a viewer, I didn't know where to find the humor or the drama. Should we be laughing at the all too real struggles of deeply affected cartoon-like people? I didn't.<br /><br />When it went for drama, the scenes were way over the top. I was supposed to buy into the relationship between Pat and Tiffany but they are both so unlikeable, I wondered why they would even want to hang out with one another. For example, the scene where they scream at one another in the diner, and she throws the bowls and glasses off the table would lead to the end of two people seeing one other. Of course, it's because they are mentally ill that they can form a relationship as 99.9999% of the rest of us wouldn't want to spend another second with such a person.<br /><br />Of course, they are mentally ill seems to be the reason for all the ridiculous behavior displayed in this film---and yet we are supposed to embrace or laugh along with it. The script showed no understanding of mental illness, the mental illness system, humanity, humor or drama.
B003IY48PS|5.0|My husband loves the evil dead series.  I think he likes Bruce Campbell.  He enjoyed watching this movie.  It is a classic B movie, not really my cup of tea.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|few books give a feel for alien situations and events as does this engrossing story of training, death and survival against the Taliban
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my husband who loves B movies.  He thoroughly enjoyed it, me not so much.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|It's James Stewart. No need to say more. From westerns to the Air Force to straight man for a rabbit he is a classic by himself.
B006O3MU96|1.0|For a whole week. Every time I tried to run this stupid app, it told me I had to login. Now all it does is crash!! I'm uninstalling! (Motorola Droid X2)
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love revenge season two is proving to be just as good as season 1. Cant wait to purchase it when it comes out on dvd.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is a series we watch together as family. Great deal for season 1 and my husband was very happy with this gift.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|It was pretty raunchy and silly in the beginning, but about halfway through, it took a dramatic turn and ended up being a pretty good movie.  Worth watching, if you can make it through the first half.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|Great deal on blu-ray and dvd. My daughter loves all movies by Tim Burton, she has been asking for this movie and this was a deal I could not pass.
B000SEI230|5.0|I loved this book because it says the true story of love and it expresses the meaning of \\" in sickness and in health\\", especially at such a young age.
B003JTHWJQ|3.0|I knew what I was getting into when I read this book but I found myself getting drowsy sometimes. However, the topic at hand is pretty heavy for some and he makes his point very clear. This book is good for someone who is sitting on the fence... agnostics. Obviously Mr. Dawkins is atheist but in my opinion, if someone is already questioning if there is a god then they have pretty much made their decision and reading this book may help solidify that internal decision... atheism.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great Harry Bosch novel. As usual with Connelly's  books, it is hard to put down. I can hardly wait for the next book.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|i used my kindle fire for this app because the screen is much larger than my iphone screen. i loved using it until one day it logged  me out from my facebook randomly so i tried to log in and it said &quot;hey there! cannot log in to facebook&quot; it said that every time! so i un-installed the app and tried to re-download it and the download from the amazon app store kept failing. now i have to use my tiny iphone screen. :/
B000FSME1A|5.0|&#34;The horror, the horror&#34; is one of the greatest scenes of animated films, ever.<br />Marlon Brando at his best.<br /><br />Other than that, a great war film that shows the horrors of war, but manages to entertain nonetheless.<br />We once wathced it in AP Contemporary English class and compared it to Greek philosophy... Deep, huh ?
B00A8KJN14|5.0|Now I'm just reviewing the movie that I saw in theaters but I'm sure the blu-ray version is going to look fantastic. This movie is just plain amazing in everyway if you love Tim Burton films. I like to think this one as his baby and he did so well on this. The characters and atmosphere are fantastic and the black and white look looks fantastic. I recommend this 100% to anyone because this movie is fantastic. The only way to describe how I felt after seeing this was how I felt after I watched the Nightmare Before Chistmas the first time. It's just that good :D
1591840562|3.0|In my opinion, not as good as the other books by Mr. Kawasaki.<br />Still ok, but not my best purchase.<br /><br />It was harder to read than his other books and I learned less from it.
B00464F19Q|5.0|Excellent movie--Freeman and Pitt really make the movie work, I can't remember how many times I've caught this movie in bits and parts, so it was nice to sit and watch the entire movie with no interruptions!
B00000F169|5.0|A classic and must have for those of you that love quirky films...<br />Negotiating with an intelligent bomb...<br />A beach ball with eyes that jumps around...<br />Great character interactions ...<br />But the best is the Grande Finale !!!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />Everyone gets what they wanted in the end :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was hard to put down once I started reading it!  I haven't seen the movie, but look forward to it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was great. Fun puzzles that kept me busy but didn't frustrate me. Addicting! Even got my husband sucked in.
B00632KSXI|5.0|Love it!  Of course the music is fabulous but what's nice is the album is made of very heavy vinyl.  Great album!  Buy it!
B005NJFSZK|5.0|Our son wanted Lewis so badly. He's THRILLED! He plays hard with his cars (they crash, etc.) and so far it has held up to his play. Well worth it for him!
0399157565|5.0|Came on time, easy open packaging. Wonderful read. My son loves R. L Stine, has all the books including Goosebumps.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I really wanted the gps and the weather. but all I got was the weather!!! Can you help me get to the gps?
B008KRJWEK|4.0|My son plays it everyday. He is interested in cars and its upgrading. Sometimes he uses points for review, so he cannot upgrade.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love this book it is full of endless mysteries and excitement. Spencer is my favorite character. I can't wait to read the next book.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I'm a big fan  of Sam Neill and he was wonderful.  The movie was in excellent condition.  Thanks so very much...
1419705849|5.0|I got this book for my son and he enjoyed reading the whole series. He read the book in a day and a half.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great way to end an amazing  trilogy, kept me on the edge of<br />my seat during the second half of the book
B001H5X7JS|4.0|This movie is funny. It has some strong language and content, so I do not recommend to be viewed around kids.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Excellent app.  Does exactly as described.  Very simple to use.  Thanks for making  this app available.  Solves woodworking problems much quicker &amp; accurately.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a great read. I couldn't put down. Read it in 3 days straight. A must read. Perfect love story full of suspence, drama and love. Will read it again.
0060736267|3.0|Book recd was not up to the rating it was given by seller.<br /><br />The story was excellent.  The central character was so realistic, I expected to find her sitting in my living roorm.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I loved the classic book, Cathy is psycho as ever and  the love triangle here definitely needs a therapist , the fact that Cathy has a brain fever makes me wonder how she would be set in modern days as mental illness is so differently delt with
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Me Liked it fun time. I play all one night harder? Next? Good fun time game games play. Make More harderer fun game like atlantis
B0019NB9A2|5.0|It may seem very archaic by todays standards, but when this came out it was the top of it's kind. A wonderful story and seeing the cast again and where they went in their careers is quite a hoot. Love the movie.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I do believe we were invented by another race for expermentation and habitation of the universe.....our forefathers show us in thier drawings where we came from who made us how they flew around et cetera.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Does not work with Motorola Droid X2. Tried numerous times and between system lockups, reboots and processor/ battery over heats, had to finally remove. The cost was too great for the use I have.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|cute game, very addicting. we beat all 100 levels between myself and my hubby. will be looking for more games like this one.
B004SBX112|1.0|Does not work with Motorola Droid X2. Tried numerous times and between system lockups, reboots and processor/ battery over heats, had to finally remove.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|I was anticipating software that would allow me to open a PDF file on a web page using an Android device without having to download the file and then open it.  I wanted to avoid the extra step.  I downloaded and installed the reader and I don't see an evidence that it is actually doing anything.  I attempted to re-install it and a pop-up windows tells me that is is already installed.  I'm not sure what it is supposed to do.  The saving grace is that it did not cost very much.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|Actually worked with my Droid X2. Was fun for a few days but became tedious and finally boring rather quick.
