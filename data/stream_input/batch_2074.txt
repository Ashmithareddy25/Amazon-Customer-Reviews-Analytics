B005HSL626|5.0|My 4 year old loves this game it is simple and just plain fun, we all play and the score really isn't a factor to the fun.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Very funny.  My wife fought me from having to watch this, but now recites lines from it almost everyday since watching.
B006QS07IK|2.0|I had never read this book before and it's always been on my list of \\"To Read\\" since I was in middle school. Then, I got to college and it was a required reading for one of my classes and I was so excited to start reading it. Now, I knew by then that the movie and book had almost nothing in common and that the Monster looked nothing like Karloff's character. But I still expected there to be some creepiness in the book. So I open to the first page...<br /><br />...Ummm...okay...so, there's some guy writing letters. Should get to the good stuff anytime soon.<br /><br />The book was a slow read from the get-go. By the time Frankenstein had created the Monster I was forcing myself to read this book because I HAD to read it. I've only ever started and not finished a book once in my life, and if this wasn't a required reading, this book would've been my second. Victor's narration of this story is so uninspired and down right boring most of the time.<br /><br />The ONLY reason that I gave this book a 2-star rating was because of the Monster's narration in the story. By that time, the book was 2/3 of the way done, so I figured the rest of the book would be a little more fast-paced. I was wrong. After the few chapters of the Monster's story, the book went right back to the pace it began with.<br /><br />The ending wasn't the worst ending out there, but it still didn't give this book any redeeming factors.<br /><br />I was surprised by this book, but in a bad way. For a book that got so much acclaim over the years I just didn't see it here. Maybe it's because of when the book was written and how books like this were written back then. I'm not sure. But this book was a very large let-down, and that's sad because this book I had been looking forward to read for years and I was largely disappointed in the end. Don't read this unless you have to. Otherwise, it's not worth it. Watch the movie.
B0090EJR1K|2.0|Perhaps it was the movie. Perhaps it was the stage in my pregnancy... But &#34;The Dictator&#34; did not inspire the uproar of laughter that I experienced with &#34;Borat.&#34; In fact, I'm pretty sure I fell asleep and did not make it to the end of the flick.
B000002NJS|5.0|This, in my eyes, is the ultimate Madonna album. Her songwriting on this album is pure genius. There wasn't a single moment on this album where I didn't think I was listning to a masterpiece. I felt like this album was the first time Madonna actually truly was songwriting. The album is so diverse and so full of energy!<br /><br />The highlights of this album were \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\", \\"Swim\\", \\"Ray of Light\\", and \\"Frozen\\". The most underrated songs on this album are \\"Swim\\" and \\"Mer Girl\\". You hardly ever hear anything about these songs, but they are true genius! \\"Swim\\" is incredibly simple, but give a great message, and \\"Mer Girl\\" is one of the darkest songs by Madonna and it's a truly wonderful experimental piece.<br /><br />This album should never be overlooked. Madonna will never write another album like this! She has never been known to write the same type of album twice in a row. This is why people hate \\"American Life\\", they were wanting that album to be like this or \\"Music\\". As of now, this IS Madonna's best album. Will she write one better in the future? It's possible. But it won't sound anything like this if it does.<br /><br />\\"Ray of Light\\" is perfect in everyway. There is no flaw on this album, I, personally, cannot find one! People might not like \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" because of the Sanskrit lyrics...but I personally love that song!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Although it was almost painful to watch during the final weeks of my pregnancy, Walking Dead Season 3 was absolutely rivoting.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I will say that I was hesitant to buy this when reading the reviews. But I have basically everything else by Madonna, and I really wanted it!<br /><br />I liked most of the songs at first, especially \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" (a personal favorite), \\"Die Another Day\\", and \\"Hollywood\\". It took a few more listens to truly appreciate many of the other songs like \\"X-Static Process\\". The only reasons this album got so much critizism was because of 1) It was too political, and 2) It wasn't \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Music\\". This is a great album in it's own right. It's so different from the other things she's recorded!<br /><br />I have to say that the only downsides to this album are the raps she does in \\"American Life\\" and \\"Mother and Father\\"...they really don't make sense.<br /><br />But this is a great Madonna album, and should not be overlooked!
B0098VXBIA|5.0|This movie gave me some much needed belly laughs during my final blaoted weeks of pregnancy. Even my husband ended up watching this \\"chick flick\\" and laughing along. It is a \\"must see\\" for any family who is counting down the days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hey everyone out there u should so platthis game it is so fun all I wish is that they would add coin packs you can buy for like. 99 cents
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read...awaiting the next book in the series. Love the characters and the story lines. Can't wait for the whole picture to be painted
0345531957|3.0|I listened to the book on audio because I love Frank Muller's voice and he brings out the best in Grisham's novels. However, even the excellent audio version could not make up for the lousy ending. There were many interesting angles in the novel but I realized that the poor ending was simply a result of an unevenly crafted plot. I like the endings to make sense and this one didn't on many levels. But I'm not giving up on Grisham as I've loved many of his other novels.
0060594896|3.0|It has been over a year since I read this, I really can't tell you if I liked it or not. Sorry

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved travelling - and by extension, surviving - with Mark.  I stayed with the story with my limited knowledge of the technology involved.  It's telling would give hope to sway us to further the space program, and encourage all nations to work together in this pursuit.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Having just started reading Jo Nesbo's books, he did not disappoint me in this one.  Keeping tract of his characters and the places they go is a challenge, but well worth the trouble.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It got even more susenseful and I cannot wait for the next season to come out!! IT WAS AMAZING! LOVe iT!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book had you wondering and changing your thoughts of who was the &#34;bad guy&#34;.  The ending was a surprise as once the mystery was solved, it was not the ending I expected.  A very good read.
B001BIMYXQ|4.0|Eurythmics are one of my favorite bands...good collection of songs for this ole woman who still enjoys older music of her time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game!! I love all of the different things you can do on it! awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is fun it is kinda addicting but it is cool I wish it cod easier to earn gems but no reason not to get 5 stars : ) &lt;3
B0089MXRII|5.0|I gave this book five stars probably because I am such a sentimenalist.  It reminded me of my own childhood experiences.  Reminds you that no matter where you live, kids all have the same hopes, dreams, and fears.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is one of the best that I have seen recently they are more interactive with the horse and realistic but it takes too long to load all of the things and I hate to wait a long period of time for a game to load
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Im at level 27 Multiplier, I have over 100,000 coins, almost all the upgrades, a ton of characters, and a lot more! Then i get on today and the app reset everything except my highscore! i spent time reaching these things and im not about to start over. I suggest now wasting your time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. but i wish that the limited time characters would be cheeper like being 20000 coins. and there should be a higher multiplier than x30
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can't stop playing it!!! It is really fun to play and entertaining:) I love it:)fun for all kids and parents
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It was a good game but I wish it were a little longer. The graphics were good and the mini puzzles were fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can now hack it by getting PocketinvEditor from the amazon app store and get more blocks and it doesn't say unauthorised request like PocketTool.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|Very good television! I enjoy the continuing plots, costuming, directing, characters, writing, it's all good. Very nostalgic and mixes in a little bit of history with the fiction. I think it could have been just as good without the gay scenes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I love trying to beat my facebook friends high scores. It's great fun for all ages
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead Season 3 Too much blood and gore for me but my husband absolutely loves this and says it is the best show he has ever seen in a long time. We will be getting cable back just to see the new shows in february
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Showed the dark side of the whiskey wars in Virginia.People know only the surface truth this novel will take you behind the headlines and put a face and a soul on all involved . Some of the language may be rude and vulgar but that was the time. The fact that these real people lends another angle. All in all not a great movie but a good one that  I enjoyed
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and beautifully designed. The horses are gorgeous and the game is crafted nicely. I would definitely recommend this game to others.<br />Thank you.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is a wonderful game with lot of prizes boards and characters you could by characters with you money not lime the other games like when you run out of coins and you have to buy the coins with real money that what I like about this game and the subway surf that I have  upgrades me to like when it Christmas it turns into  the Christmas one and then the next  New York witch and the do I world tour and I really don't  what other games I have that does that  and believe me I have a lot of games that don't do that  you would have to buy them witch is a waste of my money that's all
B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd the best! One of my favorite albums. The music far ahead of its time.So much talent went into this music.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|How inspiring to see a mothers dedication give strength to her child. Even though the doctors held out no hope temple excelled in everything she attempted to do. Excellent movie for whole family. Children will be motivated not to give up easily but to try harder to overcome obstacles in life. I learned so much about autism. Thanks you for such a wonderful movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book brings to life what happens in the real world, most sex offenders will choose their victims within their own families, and never see the evil in their actions and victims almost never get any answers but will repress what has been done. It brought me to tears, it made me angry, it also reminds how victims are strong enough to survive and move forward with life, great read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's very fun and is easy but can be tricky at times but that's what is fun about it.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Not a lot to say other then that the show is well written, smart and fun to watch.  The characters are not over the top and come across as real and vulnerable when needed.  Enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the most amazing game I have ever played in my life. It is so hard not to stop playing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a great read, I couldn't put it down. The idea of use it as a daily log was fantastic and made it seem much more personal.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|A SUPER white sound program.  I am enjoying it a great deal.  The verity of sound combination are large.  They have an even larger selection of sounds and I'm going to try that as well, although the ones that come with it are probably enough.
B0058VW36U|5.0|try feeding this cutey. He is sensitive about candy.If you have skill you can do if you give him candy hil want  MORE
0380973650|4.0|Based on plot, characterization, and overall writing style I think most fantasy lovers would enjoy this book. However, to truly appreciate it, I think it helps if one is already a Gaiman fan and/or a mythology buff.  That's what the book essentially is, a story about how mythologies evolve and the gods (who make up most of the characters) along with them. The gods haven't vanished but merely changed with the times. Not for everybody but I reallly liked it.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Slow to start but a great 'I didn't see that coming' finish. Will continue to read more of the Jack Ryan and Jack Ryan Jr series.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is one of the best new shows on. The lead actor is fantastic and the supporting cast does a phenomenal job of detailing the moral delimma facing the &#34;hero&#34;.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Every disk you insert forces you to watch a crazy long ad for showtime and it has MAJOR spoilers for this very season!
B00B780TAK|5.0|Season 3, wow!  Totally addicted to all the characters, every jot and tittle;  worth watching over and over and over and over.<br /><br />Leech should get an Academy Award, the most.  That's saying much, for everyone in the cast, crew, film editing, EVERYTHING is A+++++++++, here.<br /><br />JUST WATCH IT.  No excuse to say no, especially with the new Prime offer.
B000MAH5O2|4.0|I am not an Obama fan.  After reading &#34;The Audacity of Hope,&#34; however, I feel I know the man much better, and am comforted to a certain extent in now being convinced that he is not the flaming, socialist liberal Fox News paints him to be.  Liberal, yes, and with many of his positions contrary to my own, Obama still comes across as a decent, honorable person with the welfare, security, and integrity of the Unitied States as his prime concern.  Rush Limbaugh will never be convinced, but somehow I feel a little less concerned that our nation as we know it may be going down the tubes to destruction.  We survived Jimmy Carter...Barack Obama, in my opinion will become a closet moderate during his last four years in office. This is a good thing.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Fast paced, plenty of action. Enough fact in the fiction to be really fascinating. Anyone who is a fan of Clive Cussler will like James Rollins.
B000JCSBU0|1.0|I am sure this is a good movie, but I paid to rent it and it used to play on my Kindle.  I can't even find anywhere tor request a refund for VOD.  I have wasted the last 20 mins trying to find a way to do so, gave up so I am writing this bad review.
B00992CF6W|3.0|the new version is 6.1 and it wont let me update! can help me update it? I want the new version to play with my friends
B0076DELIG|4.0|Reminds me of a more &#34;Thinking&#34; Lee Childs, John Reacher character. This is the 1 st. book in the &#34; Melvin Bolvair&#34; series. A lots of twists and suprises. Great character, believable,. likeable guy. Good sidekick too. Very good read.
0756404738|5.0|The second book is is somehow even more riveting than the first. This one is worth buying hardbound as it is one I'll read over and over again. absolutely worth it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This Was a very interestingly Humorous book from all the books in the series and thank you very much Jeff Kenny for this entire series.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not one of Grisham's best books but nevertheless it kept me turning the pages wondering what Malcolm or Max was up to
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is hours of endless fun.I could play it all day. I like how they change the location about every month. It can get so competitive to get the best score with your friends that you keep trying ... I recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun.
B006362ZR6|5.0|I love the Frey and have another one of there cd's. All summer I was listening to this cd over and over again. My toddler<br />loves it too! This cd help to get me through a rough summer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is amazing and beastmode. Has speed suspense and comedy. If you do not have this game you need to get it. In my opinion it is better than temple run.
B003UYUP58|4.0|My husband recently experienced squama cell cancer of the throat.  As everyone else, we have went through life thinking this would not happen to us.  This book gives insight into the history, research and development of cancer treatment/science, while keeping the subject on a level that the average person can follow and understand.  The author did an excellent job of presenting this complex subject in a fashion that informs while holding the reader's interest.  That is no easy feat, my hat is off to him!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love this app it is so much fun and I just really like a lot and I don't have any thing to say I just wanted to rate it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is like my top 10 games that I love (*-*) its like number 2 on my list cos restaurant story is my first. my daughter shyann made a game called the high 5 remix (*-*) but besides her game that she made herself loves this game. so you should buy this game. ADULTS and CHILDREN you will love this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome and everything is colorful.it's just like every other one its like being in Rio and surfing subways
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS VERY ATTRACTIVE ITS VERY GREAT!!! LOT OF DETAILS AND MOSTLY HAS LOT OF DETAILS OF EVERY WHERE YOU GO!!! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME!!XOXO!!
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp claimed to have watched and been fans of the original Dark Shadows.  There is no way, because they would never have made such a pitiful story and movie.  The Preview makes it look like a comedy by it's really not.  It's actually horror, but not really; horror trying to be funny.  I'm a big fan of the original series and wanted so badly for this to be a good movie.  The main problem is that the story sucks.  With 5 years of original episodes, I don't know why they couldn't come up with something good.  To make matters worse, the original music by Robert Cobert is gone too:  no \\"Dark Shadows Theme\\".  The only thing good I can say about the movie is that the sets, costumes, and special effects were good.  I thought Johnny Depp wasn't bad and Eva Green was good too.  It is really a disgrace they couldn't pull off a good movie.  The story is stupid, only God knows what they were trying for!<br /><br />If you want to watch a movie length version of Dark Shadows watch \\"House of Dark Shadows\\".  Also the Revival Series from the early 1991 with Ben Cross and Barbara Steele is much better.  If you want to see the best, just watch a couple of hours of the original series.  I've turned kids who are in their teens and twenties onto the original series.  It is timeless and they all love it.  The original series is the best with its Gothic feel, that was never captured again in any of the remakes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. We take turns playing with 4 people and see who gets the highest coins.  We are very competitive with this game.
B000MR2OCI|5.0|Very cool-looking. Used to imagine with for a collector who loves the &#34;Big Cats&#34;, and it looks like the cats from National Geographic Wild.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so awsome i cant even belive how cool it is its so cooool<br />c oooooo l c oo l c o o l
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I loved this app, because it was fun, entertaining and the picture always had<br />wonderful quality. Highly recommended! =) I found that this app is awesome, and i hope you do too. Also, the recipes for the feed, for the horse, could definitely help those you would want a horse in the real world. Yay!!!!!!
B0090EHVMC|1.0|DO NOT download this from Amazon. Go buy or rent it from somewhere. It has been playing for less than 40 minutes & has stopped at least 10 times! Ridiculous!!
1932100660|5.0|Powerful, statistically-driven study that shows a very clear correlation between animal (and especially dairy) protein intake and its negative effects on human health.  It's hard to ignore such obvious results - those who mostly eat carbs don't have as much heart disease or certain cancers.  When people live in one culture and move to another, they start to take on the health profile reflecting their new society's dietary norms - so it's not genetic differences, it's pretty clearly nutrition.<br /><br />Even though this study was conducted at a very detailed level, the conclusions are at a macro level.  When I compare it to other works or theories about diet and nutrition, it's striking how others get really specific about one nutrient or hormone or gene and how we can control health by paying attention to it in isolation (e.g., cholesterol).<br /><br />If you're convinced that the Atkins diet or some other weight-loss is more healthy for you, then this book is still worth reading just to see another perspective.
B006PFC2FA|2.0|But not a good guidepost - at all - if you are interested in being in a local production of the musical. No one sings atr all in this movie but Gene Kelly, and as we all know Cyb Charisse doesn't sing in this. Charlie's great ballad and Meg Brockie's 2 funny songs are cut from the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun for all ages!  The graphics are phenomenal and enjoy the different themes from New York to Rio.  It's a pleasure to play.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A nice little read. Not a page-turner, but interesting enuf to pick up again.<br />A San Francisco feel-good/google/ mystery adventure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. I love this game. I love the characters and the game itself is so addicting. I cant stop playing this game I'm really excited to see the next update after Rio.
B001C08RHA|4.0|I thought it was enjoyable and look forward to wathcing Iron Man II. Thank  you from Judy Meyer New York
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Splashing was easy to setup and works like a charm. Get this app! You get full function of you pc, but using the pointing device takes some practice.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The twists and turns in this tale keep you anxiously awaiting each scene. It is addictive. In a good way.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|love it.  Easy to use when I go away for the weekend,  or stay at friends house.  Reliable.  and the unit doesn't even need to be turned on

B00A757EFW|3.0|I love old school video.  Not an easy game to play on the kindle though.  I play it from time to time just for kicks.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I liked the book for the story, the historical perspective about London during WW2, and the surprise ending.  Definitely recommend.
0061801313|5.0|After a couple of years of watching Pretty Little Liars on tv, most of my friends kept telling me to read the books because it has more secrets, more drama and of course it has more story to tell than the shows. I highly recommends you to purchase that book set. Trust me you will like it a lot!
B0068LYEHA|4.0|As someone who frequently declares myself a feminist, it was so wonderful to read a book by a woman who truly understands the meaning of the word. This book is honest in the truest sense. The author, as funny as she is brilliant, tells it like it is and embraces the ups and downs of her life for the benefit of telling a story. I would recommend this book to any young woman searching for her place in the world and trying to develop a view on important issues. It made me think as much as it made me laugh.
B005MMY5RK|4.0|At times this movie can be a little hard to follow, but given it's status as being one of the best movies of all time it's definitely worth a watch.
B001D8W7CW|5.0|this movie carrie is an excellent movie this is a 5 star movie sissy spacek is excellent in it the bluray is awsome.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book! It was the perfect kind of romance novel. To tell the truth I was already recommending this book to all my friends and coworkers before I even finished the book! They were hooked too! Greatest book in the whole wide world!!!!! :) Thank you Colleen Hoover!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|WiFi Explorer Pro is a great wireless transfer solution and is great on the go since there's no program to download on the computer
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I love the idea that it rotates, I would give 5 stars to that! Unfortunately, the case that holds the Kindle itself is not as secure as it seems. I was opening the case and somehow it slowly flipped and the Kindle detached from the holder. Luckily, I was on a carpeted area and sitting on a low couch where I did not have a lot of damage to my new Kindle! I have to be overly protected to my Kindle whenever I open the case.
0738711500|1.0|After thoroughly reading the description, excerpts and several pages of reviews, I thought this book would give me what I wanted.  I was looking for a good introduction to the Tarot, which would teach me the meanings behind each of the cards.  Plus, it came with a deck, which to me seemed a bonus!  I've received readings from a number of skilled practitioners over the years, and have always been impressed when they pointed out all the nuances in the card and what it could refer to.  I had read cards myself as well, though I'd used a non-traditional deck; I was looking for a more traditional deck and a way to really get to know the cards, so that I could have a deep understanding of them.<br /><br />I awaited its delivery impatiently, and when it arrived, I started reading it immediately.  There is chapter after chapter of warning and rules: \\"Wrap your deck in a cloth...never let it touch a table...don't do readings for your friends...be careful what you say...read this book in order...keep a tarot journal....\\"  I bore with it patiently, even though the sheer amount of structure started to become overwhelming.  Finally, I reached a section that was conspicuously ABSENT from the excerpts shown on this page: \\"you don't need to understand the links between Tarot and astrology, numerology, alchemy, and kabbalah to produce good readings.\\"  Wait, what?  This throwaway statement is her whole defense for not including ANY of the symbology for the cards.  Tarot is ABOUT symbology.  Artists work little details into each card because of the meanings behind them.  Every single detail on the card is intentional.  And she just flippantly mentions that she won't be discussing the symbols.<br /><br />Stunned, I flipped ahead to look at the pages for the cards, because of course not one of the excerpted pages showed the actual card pages.  Sure enough, each page has a scant amount of information.  There is a black-and-white picture of the card, which is unnecessary if you have the deck that came with the book.  Then there is a description of the picture, which is unnecessary if you have eyes to look at either the card or the picture of the card presented right there on the page.  Finally, there is a VERY brief (as in, 3 sentences, give or take) paragraph of the basic meaning of the card.  For example, the Two of Pentacles basically says \\"This is a card about juggling, so you might be juggling things in your life, like home and career, or finances.  Try to find balance.\\"  That's it.  There are a few more words used to describe this (mine is a synopsis), but there is absolutely no discussion of the nature of pentacles, the numerology or significance of the number two card, or even the symbology of the pictures.  The description points out that there is a ship, a moon, and a dolphin in the background -- which, again, we can see ourselves -- and simply says that these signify the emotions, and they don't distract the juggler.  No explanation of what they might have to do with the emotions, or their separate significance.<br /><br />The amount of information given for each card is little more than you would find in the little booklet that accompanies most decks of Tarot cards.  There is more space and energy and effort given to setting up ridiculous rules and hoops to jump through than there is to actually impart any information.  I'm quite shocked that this author managed to get a whole book published, let alone convince the artist to let her bundle his deck with them.  There is nothing of any help in this book, and I am extremely disappointed to have wasted the time and the money on this book.  I will be returning it immediately.  I feel deeply misled by the description and the excerpts, which did nothing to warn me of the true contents of this book.  Amazon has a responsibility to its customers to provide HELPFUL excerpts, not pages that have nothing to do with the actual subject matter, and are mere introductions to the book at best.<br /><br />I write this review only to warn other potential buyers that this book is not all it seems.  It would be impossible to overexaggerate how LITTLE information this book has.  I can't imagine that even Tarot for Dummies (if there is such a thing) could have less substance than this.I write this review only to warn other potential buyers that this book is not all it seems.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game<br /> is sweet it is also very addicting to you I encourage anyone to buy it have fun if you do
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Not 1, not 2, but 3 versions of T2. This is really not a bad deal. The picture is beautiful and still holds up really well after all these years.<br /><br />The disc has a nice interface and at the start of the disc it looks like you're really looking up information about Skynet.<br /><br />The disc does have tons of extras. Original teasers and trailers as well as BTS footage. This is a great edition and must have for those who need to add something to your Blu-Ray collection.<br /><br />Fast shipment from Prime as well. Couldn't be happier.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app and it has been extremely accurate every time I have used it. I will recommend it to everyone!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and fast moving and just a great game to escape from daily life for a few minutes and have fun playing!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I never knew expressions could be so raw and beautiful. This is the type of album you listen to when your soul needs some good feeding. One of the greatest albums of all time from start to finish.
B009YQJ322|4.0|The story of Judge Dredd, need to be told in a R formate just like the Punisher. The writing, action and visual effects are on par with a budget 3 times this small budget movie. Karl Urban brought Dredd to life without any of the cheese or over acting that Stallon did. GET THIS MOVIE!!!! if you liked John Rambo you will love this movie.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|If you just listen to \\"I think of you\\" -love is explained. No one can write the way this man does. Genius.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I have purchased the entire set of Ice Age movies, and this one made an excellent final (at least for now) addition. It begins with a very entertaining (and essential to understanding the rest of the movie) sequence about how Scrat the Squirrel nearly destroys the planet by chasing an acorn to the center of the earth. It gets better as the plot develops, and indeed it does.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Outstanding fantasy book by an up and coming author, on par with The Name of The Wind or Song of Ice and Fire
B000BJS4OY|1.0|I am not really a hifi-enthusiast, but there certainly is something wrong with the compression on this remaster.<br /><br />The harmonica in the opening is screeching. And the Boss is hissing all his s'es. I get a headache from listening to the entire record.<br /><br />I thought it was just the way the record sounded originally until I got hold of a second hand copy of the album. The sound on the old cd is so much better. You can distinguish the instruments and Springsteen does not sound like a ssssssnake.<br /><br />If you mess with old music, please make it sound better - not worse!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this app best game ever the world tour is cool to I really think u should get it I got it on Christmas been playing it nonstop scense
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books, and this, I believe, is the best one yet.  I had a hard time putting it down, and highly recommend it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Many different routes to run. Increase your skills cover time. Jumping, sliding, gather coins, upgrade strengths... Fun for the entire family. My wife has been trying to get me to play this, so after we got the kindle fires, I finally got it and LOVE it!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I have always enjoyed Led Zeppelin, but the dvds and music far exceeded my expectations.  I have either listened to the CD or dvds sinceII got it in the mail.  The only thing I wish is that Amazon would add the mp3s to my cloud.  So far only 6be of the 16candy have been added.<br />  If you remotely like Zeppelin, then you will want the whole collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game so fun to play. Even my little brother could play this game.hope that this helps you out.  This game also helps create computation between my friends.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Seen this film many times but never fails to make me laugh and cry, fantastic music, amazing voices, great actors
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Great app but as others have stated, lately, the update fails with &quot;program not installed&quot;. Always worked great in the past....hopefully fixed later.
B00001W9G0|5.0|What more can I say, brilliant actors, great film, political but still excellent, can watch this over and over again.
B003UYUP6M|4.0|The book is quite a nice bit of history + culture about one of the most important companies on the internet today. Motivational from an entrepreneurial perspective, and inspirational from an engineer's perspective. The writing style is pretty dry, but I guess that's to be expected from a modern tech-biography. Also, as a software engineer, I thought it might be a recruiting ploy from the many references to the fact that software engineers &#34;rule&#34; the company.<br /><br />If I could summarize the book in a sentence or two it would be: If you're a genius, and you have brilliant ideas, and you can convince lots of other geniuses that your ideas are cool, then you can make a successful startup (gee really?). Also, Google is very &#34;data-oriented&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game,very addictive, the graphics are amazing, it's all to do with speed and concentration.it's a true family game, I can't put it down
0345529057|4.0|The books are amazingly written! Since the books are paperback, the spine of the books do tend to show wear from use. Also, the case started coming apart after a while and needed glue to keep it together. Overall, great price for 4 books and pretty satisfied with the purchase!
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Didn't think I would like it as much as I do ,it overtook my beloved TheWalking dead as favorite show .when it was over I couldn't wait until season two released on bluray and found online options to watch it . Season one will make you happy,you will be sad,it will make you curse the old gods .<br />Because the writer of the books is mercy less and has no heart. Towards the end of season 1<br />I said I would never watch this show again ,because of the episode before the season finale ,but then you watch the last episode and you keep on going . So good,so Good. I'm just rambling now buy it .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is a very fun. It is very fun to play and you always gave a good time playing this game. I'm happy that this game was in invented.
0385344228|4.0|This book was gripping from the start.  Any parent, especially of an adolescent child, will be both moved and disturbed by the book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing and fun. I have a great time playing this game. It keeps me entertained for hours on end. And I can't ever really put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun, fun,  fun; cute as heck and very entertaining! I love the location changes; for example<br /> - to New York and Rio.  Lovely scenery
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It needs to be harder<br />And you should let ourselves turn around the blocks not the game. So there for you could make it better
B004I744AS|5.0|The Dictionary includes several different languages, a legal and a medical dictionary. What a treasure. It also has interesting word games, wordof the day and more. It is one of my favorite apps.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it passes time really fast. I thought it was a waste of 7 dollars but it's not. I can't wait till they update it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is probably one of the most addictive games I have ever played and IS pretty fun but it is obviously a total spin off from temple run.  I don't realy like the idea of the game either and think it could have been a little more creative.
1439152802|3.0|I was excited to see Kate Morton had a new book out.  I quickly ordered it. But I must admit, I felt it was not one of her best.  The storyline was interesting but the book seemed overlong and contrived.<br /><br />There seemed to be a lot of activities and scenes that dragged on and on. Almost as if to add depth but it just seemed to be a page filler.<br /><br />I hope this was just a fluke and her next novel will be crisper.
B00008PX8P|5.0|It's impossible to exaggerate how good this collection is. Distilled from several of Zeppelin's filmed live performances from 1969 through the 1970s and released in 2003, taken as a whole this is possibly the greatest concert DVD of all time from a rock-blues band.<br /><br />You get around five hours of astonishing live performance footage spread over 2 DVDs. A gig filmed in b&w in front of a tiny studio audience in 1969 for Danish Radio is the earliest footage; the latest a masterful performance at Knebworth in summer 1979, the last time the band played together in public before Bonzo's untimely death in 1980.<br /><br />The first disk contains the early stuff, kicking off with a 102-minute concert at The Royal Albert Hall in 1970 with the band bursting with energy as they deliver 12 numbers mainly from the first two albums, but with a couple of surprises like Page's virtuoso solo-turn on electric guitar `White Summer.' The extras include the aforementioned Danish Radio performance, a promo for `Communication Breakdown' and two more TV performances of `Dazed and Confused' - one on French TV with both Page & Plant in bright red trousers.<br /><br />The second disk culls material from Madison Square Garden, the last night of the 1973 US tour; from the shows at Earls Court in mid-1975 (the album's high-point acoustic set proving what exemplary folk musicians they were); and the sell-out Knebworth show in 1979.<br /><br />The sound quality is overall surprisingly crisp, the film quality variable but never less than acceptable with occasional brief snippets of bootlegged film from members of the audience and close-up stills spliced in. Overall, it's a fine production job.<br /><br />There's also some footage revealing Robert Plant as the warm, articulate spokesman for the band, notably a relaxed interview with Bob Harris in 1975 when he discusses the forthcoming `Physical Graffiti' album.<br /><br />Overall if you're a fan of this greatest-of-all British rock/blues bands of the 1970s then buying this is a must. If you're a young, aspiring musician of a later generation and don't understand why Zeppelin is held in such reverence, then watch the performances on this DVD just once - and you'll get it.ds of the 1970s then buying this is a must.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's like a kid version of Temple Run, but isn't as easy as kid version.... it's really addicting and fun to play in your free time~
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game. Keeps me entertained and to me is great for animal or horse lovers I would recommend this game to others
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game my favorite thing to play cant wait to get Zoe.I would rate 5 star because I aboustley love this game.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Like all Burton films, this is weird.  I liked it.  This is actually not a very scary movie, and kinda funny.
0553801473|4.0|It seems as if Martin is reaching for something, I'm not certain what...however, I like many I know, am saddened that he kills off cool characters (young Wolf) and keeps ones who need the killing...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I wish I had downloaded this a long time ago. Easy to set gentle noises or loud. The gradual alarm is awesome. Two thumbs up.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great story line, complicated but as long as you watch it its easy to figure out. I love it!!!! Great writers! I love scary stories.  I hope this is a show that will go on forever!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's great and all but some things  that they need  to add are armor and being able to use Redstone
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game to play and it keeps you occupied when your bored I really recommend this to anybody !!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its better than the original temple run plus its free. I'm going to write these words because I have to write 20.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|The movie is perfect if you are a high school boy, but if you are looking for a good date movie with your wife, keep looking. While the family guy is somewhat entertaining, putting the same humor in a film was disturbing.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|The game is very fun.But the demo is  very short. You should get the free version first then get the full version. Great fun.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I found this on TV one night years ago and absolutely fell in love. I stayed up just to watch more and was sorely disappointed when I realized I had to wait for the second half. I then planned around watching the second half and enjoyed it just as much and ordered it immediately. At the time I had never read Jane Eyre, nor had any desire to. I have since read the book twice and watched numerous other versions. This is my absolute favorite version.<br /><br />I am a movie fanatic and grew up watching the classics (thanks to a father who doesn't really enjoy more recent movies). I really love watching movies made from books, primarily because I love to see what the script writer will pull out that I never noticed and what they missed. Is this movie true to the book? NO! There are certainly aspects that seem to have been pulled from thin air, Rochester is a bit more evil to Adele, and the characters are far more attractive than they are in the book. Let's be serious though, in this age having two very unattractive and unappealing actors take the roles would not have been well accepted.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the chemistry between all of the actors and I thought the acting was enticing. The cinematography was beautiful and even the music was well done (I often find myself humming Adele's little tune from the flashback scene).<br /><br />Give it a chance, just don't expect it to match the book exactly or you'll never find a version that you like.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Had fun playing this great game. love horses and this game makes me feel like lm  back home!! miss my horses!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett has a gift for making history come alive. He captures the political and social sweep of the 20th century in the West through the lives and generations of several families. I've known bits and pieces of all this history, but he makes it all hang together in a comprehensive way. I also appreciate how he doesn't make any country the &#34;good&#34; guys or the &#34;bad&#34; guys. There are heros and villains in every country. There are good and bad political moves by every country. Some work out, and some don't. There's enough blame and courage to go around for everyone. A worthy sequel to Book One.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love the artwork.  Despite there being some uncanny valley business, the backgrounds and characters are beautifully done, and the important objects go together as logically as a game like this allows. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is the way you have to click some thin objects several times to have it register.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I love sci-fi, mysteries, and Bruce Willis... so you'd think this would be a hit with me. Disappointing on all three accounts.
0345529057|4.0|I love the books-- this isn't a review so much about the stories as it is this product. The books are 7 inches tall. You can buy larger, easier to read versions, but I couldn't beat this price. That said, I now regret that I didn't splurge and buy the larger copies. My hands became cramped from reading these four books obsessively, all one right after the other. I had fingers that began to tingle and go numb from holding these books open. And once I had read each book and broken in their spines, I'm not able to fit all four paperbacks back into this their slip case again. I would rip the flimsy cardboard if I tried. The truth is that when I want to re-read these books, I try to check out a hardcover copy from my library, so I can hold it open easily. I consider these to be my backup copies, tucked on a shelf, ready for me to access if I want to recall a certain scene. These are not my go-to reading copies. I blame myself- I knew I was buying small copies, I just didn't anticipate how hard they'd be to read every night. For some people, these smaller, dense books at this low price will be ideal, and they will have no problems with these books. But if you think you are going to want to revisit your books often, consider buying the larger formats. I am seriously considering repurchasing them in a larger format now.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am a crafter and write all my own patterns. Evernote allows me to write my patterns on my kindle and access them from my phone and any pc anytime. I also download useful charts for sizing the garments I make all in one location. Very useful app, I recommend it all the time!
B00992CF6W|4.0|l love this game but it cant get the 6.0.6 update it sucks I have the update on my I phone but not on my kindle. And I would like to play it on a bigger screen
1616890835|4.0|Wonderful to see sign painters, so long overlooked, celebrated.  I do wish, however, that some more whimsical styles had been represented.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|A very good rendition of a stage show we are going to see this coming week. The CD was received in good condition
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is the best game in the world it's awesome, I think we should all be able to play in anybody's game
B00AHSINKO|3.0|The husband & wife appeared \\"old\\" for their<br />roles. Merrill Streep & Tommy Lee Jones<br />acting was below par, their script was alittle boring as well. However, Steve Carrell<br />did a great job.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Love getting the ultraviolet copy as added value so can be watched anywhere!  Great remake!  Great twist from original. Good deal.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Excellent read. Just wish it had lasted longer. Stephen King didn't let me down. Love his books. Keep them coming.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|It was ok but it was that funny as the others so it's a 2 i guess  well thats it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have horses of my own, as a virtual game goes, it's pretty accurate. Just without the sweet smell of horses.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best I wish I could play it in real life I hope you came out with a second one of the most popular game who ever is the creator rocks because this game rocks
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Fun movie to watch although the graphics were a little extreme at times.  Fun to see all the action players in different roles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is Awesome it is so so cool , it is the best game in the whole wide world
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever! Please update it to v0.6.1 for the newest update on minecraft! I already have the new update on my iPod.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer rocks it is so fun when I'm bored I start playing it and I'm not bored anymore I love playing it Its so awesome it is a cool game I love the way the surf board glides on the trains and how.fast they run and when it gets really fast it's so fun I like the mystery box it helps out a lot well that's all I have to say!!!!!!!!!!
B0051CSI0G|5.0|If u like the walking dead you going to love this. Starts off straight to the point. ZOMBIES VS. A FEW GOOD MEN.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it so much fun no complaints! Be careful though it might get YOU  addicted!! I know that anyone who gets this game will love it!
B000I9U9A4|1.0|Worst Russell Crowe movie I ever saw and I really like Russell Crowe. He did not really have a lot of lines to say. The movie was very boring in my opinion.
B007N9FKCY|1.0|honestly I like the sound track but the game is not really that fun.  I would of liked it if there was powerups or somethine but its just not worth it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|really like the game. lots of different styles(standard hidden object, shadow,darkness). easy to play. does take a lot of time if u want the game to truly be free. only annoying thing is that it constantly asks if I want to download content to b faster.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy Spider...it's one of the ways I wind down at the end of the day.  It is also a good exercise for my not so young brain!
B003Y5H574|5.0|I love this movie. It is so funny. Not surprising considering Steve Correll is in it :) I mostly bought it because I am a HUGE Ryan Gosling fan, and it's my goal to own every one of his movies. This is part comedy, party romance. Definitely a movie both males and females can enjoy together. Date night anyone?
B00005JKG9|5.0|Absolutely love this classic.<br /><br />I recently saw the 30th anniversary play on Broadway and decided to pick up the movie and relive it!
B0024Y5ZKK|5.0|One of Bob's best albums. I love it. Got this album for my boyfriend for Christmas. It played great. These songs will make you feel so relaxed.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|The part where her husband came to the store to burn it and kill her was overdone.  The description of his activities and physical state seem to go on and on.
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|Glad to see this franchise return to the ways of PA and PA2. Good cast with a decent story connection. Definite recommendation
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I really liked it.  Full of emotion, passion and of life events.  I liked the twist and turns in  the plot.  I liked how the emotional struggles were portrayed and even with bad and pain, there was good achieved.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is more realistic then the first temple now if they could get it so 2 people can play against eachother like monkey who is a person vs player
B003MOHX8S|5.0|How to put into words the emotional response you feel when listening to their music is hard without using words like Epic, Emotive, and at times overwhelming.  This is music to stir and move the heart and soul.  It evokes images and feelings like very few pieces that I have ever listened to.  If you love scores/soundtracks you will not be disappointed.
B004QSQML8|4.0|My order arrived very fast but there was some questionable issues related to the Blu-ray DVD I received, so my review will be based on general playback performance at first glace impressions, & BD disc extras features. my review is for the Blu-ray not the film or I would have given it  5 stars instead of 4<br /><br />First the HD picture quality is good but not the best I've seen better, though on the plus side there are two versions of the film the Original theatrical release, & the directors cut personally I like both versions, but I happened to like the version with Tangerine Dream soundtrack slightly better though I wish the theatrical version would have included Lily's singing I thought the singing was beautiful & it fit the film quite well that portion should have stayed in the theatrical release<br /><br />That said I can sort of understand why certain scenes were taken out or cut. one scene in particular the scene where Lily was walking over to pet the unicorn & Jack shouted to Lily begging her not to there is a scene where Lily looks back at Jack, & at that moment Lily seemed sort of devious I think that impression was due to the close up & the look on Lily's face sort of helped give me the impression that Lily wasn't as innocent as she seemed, but in the US theatrical version Lily seemed completely innocent just a bit reckless during the same scene without that quick look back to jack, just a little observation while watching this movie again for what must be the 100th time<br /><br />Extras include a behind scenes look at making of the film also interviews with director Ridley Scott, & actors Tim Curry & Mia Sara. the BD also theatrical trailer, and music video of the song Is Your Love Strong Enough by Bryan Furry, BD also includes audio commentary from the director, & deleted scenes or scene. I haven't watched all of the extras, but I will soon, and I might update my review after viewing them, that said at first glace this Blu-ray is worth buying if youlove this movie as I do, but make sure you have an authentic Blu-ray studio release
B000BZISTE|1.0|Good satire is subtle and I love good satire. Too bad Robert Altman forgot that principle when he made this movie. Somehow I never got around to seeing this movie at the time it was causing a sensation during and after the Vietnam war. It is intended as a satire on the futility of war, especially that particular war. But I, along with millions of other Americans, couldn't wait for the next episode of the TV series, year after year. So when I saw this \\"Collector's Edition\\" in the listings I thought it would be great to see what started it all. Bad move.<br /><br />This is Benny Hill satire and about as subtle as a 5-year-old! For instance, each of the far-too-many 'operating' scenes looks as if, once all the actors were in place and just before the camera rolled, someone threw a couple of gallons of bright red paint all over everyone and everything. I find it more than a little ironic that this is one case where the TV series was far superior to the movie. The TV series was a masterpiece. This is a child's finger painting!
B00846REIS|4.0|Wow once I started reading this book it reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey, but it is different and has its twists. This is a page turner because you want to know what is going to happen next. This book got me hooked into reading the next books. I only recommend this book for adults due to pornigraphic description. As soon as I finished this book I had to get the next right away.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games.  my daughter and I play each other when we have long waits.<br /> my child is adhd and it keeps her busy
B008673ZAQ|4.0|When I read this book I could not put it down because something was always happening. I give it such a high rating because you can get lost in the book with all the drama that happens. However, I do recommend this book only for adults.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a great app but if you want to keep your points and coins and then you upgrade to Subway Surfed Rio then you lose everything.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book I had to get this one. It's a good story line. Other than the BDSM it's a romantic love story. This book will want you to seek adventure in your love life. So much drama going on. Still recommend only for adults.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love it it is so fun but it is a little bit ora bad influence on little kids telling them they should spraypaint things and get chased by a cop.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I wish it had letter tabs, so I can get the letter of the word I'm looking for faster. That would make owning a kindle version worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can not stop playing, my whole family plays!  It is so fun, my 3 year old loves it! Fun for the whole family!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Got this after reading the reviews.  It does exactly what it should and works perfectly with the Kindle Fire first generation though I do leave it plugged in as I like the clock displayed and that does drain the battery
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very easy to use! One of my favorite games and now I can take it with me - very addicting.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|Once I can figure out how to use the dictionary it will probably be ok.  I typed in a word and then can't figure out how to use the dictionary.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I enjoyed the game even though it is a bit short.  It is a bit annoying to have to tap so many times between scenes especially given how many times you have to go back and forth.  Overall still a good game for the great price.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I thought that this was just another app that would have pop ups and would be slow at loading, well I was wrong. its a good app and my newphew and nice like love it. great for kids as long as they don't try to buy more gems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|IT IS  BEST GAME EVER I  CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT NEITHER CAN MY GRAND PAPPY<br />I Can not get enough coins so I get addicted to subway surfers
0446547573|5.0|This book is absolutely gripping. To those who say sparks is a bad writer are clearly trying to be sophisticated in their own writing, but don't understand that the general audience and the steam of consciousness of characters don't think in sophisticated words. Sparks is a famous author for a reason. He brings the reader into the mind of the characters in a way thats relatable, and yes, this is what characters are supposed to be: RELATABLE. we would not enjoy a book if we couldn't identify with characters. BY FAR BEST BOOK HE HAS WRITTEN. .
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham does not disappoint with The Racketeer.  The book caught my interest from the start and gets very exciting as the story progresses.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was very funny and interesting I literally was laughing  out loud!I read it all in one day it was very interesting
B00838HRP2|1.0|I bought this disk for my daughter's birthday and she was heartbroken when we sat down to watch only to discover that this is actually a DVD imported from England and therefore will not play on a standard American DVD player.  No where in the description does the seller mentioned that this disk is imported and will not work in the US.  I love the movie but save yourself the disappointment and find another seller.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|Regardless of your ethical or moral judgements on how Christopher led his life, or should have led his life, I have to agree that this was a great film.  There are some real life lessons to be learned from this story.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Slow Slow Slow. Interesting story plot. There is some good action at the end, but over all it just is missing something and could have capitalized on the plot more. Not a bad movie and worth a rent, but not to own. It def has some missed opportunities in it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game and it is awesome that Amazon has it n the appstore, but I am wondering if the update is coming soon? Update hit this week on the google play store.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great! Very addicting. Love the graphics and all the different characters and perks u can purchase with the coins you collect. I have plenty of games but this is the pretty much the only one I play at all times. Never gets old.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I thought Hopeless was an ok read. If you are a 15-17 year old girl you will probably love it.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I bought this movie because I wanted to see how it was and see if it was worth the money> Truth is it was totally worth it! It's funny, cute, good for the whole family. It keeps the traditional stereotypes of monsters, food, etc but also shows a lighter and friendlier side to the famous monsters we all know and love. I definitely give this a 5/5 for it's great story and unique cast.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I worked for a very long time on getting characters I had Tasha .Tagbot. Lucy and Tricky and Had a bunch of coins. When I updated this and went to play I had 0 coins and no characters except the one you start with. I love this game but I really want my stuff back. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I was quite interested in the story and the author did a great job of objectively portraying the events without  getting into a political agenda.  He appears to be very objective, and makes it clear how dedicated professionals can get the job done.
B007SGM084|5.0|Everyone made a big deal over all the sex in the book but nothing was ever said about the real storyline. I found all three books to be impossible to put down and I'm very sorry I'm finished with them.They made me laugh, tear up, smile and I enjoyed them all. Fabulous storyline.
B00000AFDW|3.0|This album represents a crossroads of sorts for Kiss.  For the first time in 20 years or so, both Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were back in the lineup.  Kiss was back in makeup, and with the lineup restored, things seemed ripe for a great reunion album.  Unfortunately, most of the songs come across as slightly weak, and while there are classics throughout, this is no debut album, Hotter than Hell, or Destroyer revisited.  My personal favorite on the album is Into the Void, Ace's major contribution to the album.  All in all, it beats some of the 'unmasked' period works, but only those who really want everything the original lineup made need apply.  (The most unfortunate part of the album is that, for the subsequent tour, Peter Criss was again kicked out of the lineup, replaced with former drummer Eric Singer, who wore Peter's Catman makeup.)
B001NB6L2G|5.0|This is the English version of the Happy Jack Album.  The majority of these songs are different recordings from the U.S. Version which sadly are now undownloadable.  I personally prefer the U.S. versions.  This is a classic rock album with a bunch of good bonus tracks from that era.  The success of this LP brought the Who to the U.S. for their first Tour.
B000001EL7|5.0|This album represents the last of Kiss in their purest studio form (Alive II's small number of studio tracks notwithstanding).  Die hard fans of Kiss will appreciate that all four members sing on the album, while the songs are well written and pack the usual Kiss punch.  From here and Alive II, Kiss began to change; Dynasty and Unmasked experimented with a different sound, while Peter Criss was mostly absent from the albums as well due to substance abuse problems.  After his departure came the abomination known as Music from the Elder, which is to be avoided, and the subsequent departure of Ace Frehley.  Although Creatures of the Night would redeem Kiss, this is the last album for fans of the old lineup and sound until Psycho Circus some 20 years later, which also proved not as great an album as it should have.  Love Gun is a send off of sorts, then.  Enjoy it for the classic it is, and if you feel like probing deeper into Kiss lore, the solo albums, later albums and the entire &#34;unmasked&#34; catalogue await you!
B008220BP2|5.0|I'm a guy that loves his zombie flicks. A few of my favs are Romero's zombie franchise, Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Planet Terror, and Zombieland. It could be argued that this movie is the 'Zombie Twilight' In a way, it is, but it's actually done very well. The acting is good, and the characters are likable. It has a few cheesy and funny moments such as R telling Julie to act like a zombie so the others won't eat her. Our male protagonist is a zombie named R. He can't remember his name or what happened before the apocalypse. He lives at an airport with his other zombie friends. On the prowl for human flesh, R runs into a beautiful girl named Julie. He begins to fall in love with her, and it slowly makes him human again. Their relationship is very sweet and adorable. Their new friendship is soon threatened by the skeletal zombies called bonies. The humans and the zombies must team up together to rid the world of the real monsters. If you love zombies and love stories, I'd definitely recommend WARM BODIES!!!
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera had made a couple of albums prior to this, but they were mostly in the glam vein and not very good to boot.  But somewhere along the line, the lineup came up with a much harder, more pure metal sound and ditched the Motley Crue look for a new feel, which emerged on this album.  There is nary a bad track on the disc, and along with their subsequent releases Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven, make for a trio of metal albums almost unrivalled in the early 90s, a period noted mostly for grunge bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains.  This is a wholly different sound from grunge; it takes you by the scruff and won't let go until the last track.  Consider yourself warned, this is no album for sissies!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and exciting. The whole family plays and we love trying to beat eachothers scores. My only complaint is that the character unlocks require too many items to obtain. Other than that great fun.
B000002KET|5.0|None other than Tony Iommi himself rates this as the best Ozzy period Black Sabbath album, and it's easy to see why.  There is not a weak track on the whole album, from the opening Sabbath Bloody Sabbath to the end of the last track, every song is good.  Not one track mars this album, and all four members are hitting bang-on throughout.  A highly recommended album which will lead the faithful to levels of musical brilliance not seen again until the Ronnie James Dio fronted Heaven and Hell.  This is a must have for any Ozzy fan or any fan of Sabbath in general.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|I loved this show. The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because in comparison to the  beginning, the end felt rushed... I could sense the writers thinking, &#34;hey, we need to wrap this up!&#34;  Beautifully shot, superb acting, really shocking at first... they pushed the envelope here and succeeded. Definitely watching season 1 now....
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I enjoy movies about historical figures, especially if it is pretty accurate. This was a beautifully portrayed film and Colin Firth's performance was dynamic.  He definitely deserved the Oscar for his brilliant portrayal.  I would highly recommend this movie to all.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|both my grand daughter and i like this game it is really hard to stop playing this game and get work done around the house
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this latest installment in the Pendergast series. As usual the story was intriguing, exciting, even if a little far fetched. I particularly enjoyed getting to know some of the characters better. Proctor, Vinnie and Laura, Constance and Dr Felder,Corrie, and even Pendergast's maid at the Dakota. Several new characters are introduced who will definitely make for interesting future story lines. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait for the next.
B000002O1P|4.0|\\"Southern Accents\\" is a really good album,but it should have had at least ten tracks.It's a bit short.\\"Trailer\\",a song that Tom Petty recorded during the \\"Southern Accents\\" recording sessions,should have made this album.But instead got canned and used as a B-side to his \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" 45 rpm single.The song can still be found on his 1995 \\"Playback\\" box set.But that is one of Petty's best tunes,and it absolutley should have been on this album and also released as a single as well.It's that good.Overall,this is still a good album,and I would still recommend it for the other great songs on it,such as the title track,\\"Rebels\\" and of course \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\".I give it a 4 out of 5.
B008F5Y7UQ|5.0|I downloaded this movie to watch during a plane trip to visit family.  It was recommended to me by a friend as a good movie to see and it definitely is a good movie.  I have become a fan of Ewan McGregor's and found his character in this movie very well done.  It was touching, humorous and over very enjoyable to watch.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I knew when I first saw him on American Idol that he would be a famous county singer and his CD won't disapoint
B0013K1ALE|2.0|i thought i was getting the DVD I've seen on VH1 Classis as &#34;The Song Remains The Same Reissiue''<br />with new footageof Zeppelin doing different gigs than Madison Square Garden but it's just the same movie that<br />they put out in 1975 and bashed it saying they didn't even see it before it was released but I learned later they lied (a Led Zeppelin tradition like ripping off other musicians and calling it their own) at least song writers have zep to thank for more strict copywrite laws
B009FZHYKU|5.0|wel what shoud i say? the walking dead!!!!!! thats all that needs to be said. i got this  and had to wait till feb 10th to seasion 3 to start again :( . the best show on the air.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was a great book which kept you reading from start to finish!  Really enjoyed it.  I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever! I give it 5 stars because it's very fun. Getting hit by trains and chased by the police is all apart of it.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|We were lured in because we like Family Guy, but since there are apparently no rules for making movies, macfarlane used explicit language for shock value instead of doing something clever.  There was zero humor and the characters made no sense.  Kunis' character, who is put together and supposed to be intelligent, was with the teddy bear and Wahlberg's moronic dead beat character for 4 years because he was hot?! Don't get the Flash Gordon cocaine thing... Very random...<br /><br />Probably a guy with too much money, backing, and no ideas making a movie...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Beat book ever.. i cant wait to get the second one.. third one .. and thw next.. i wander how much it cost.. i wuld pay 100 for it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that you guys should make the tour go all over the world like every week the place is different.<br />Also you should make harder challenges then give them more coins to buy more characters, powerups, and hover boards. You should also make more characters and hoverboards to chose from.you should make the game harder not the same all the time like give them a handglider as a powerup so they can soar through the sky to get more coins.<br /><br />  Please make theese changes, me.

B004FHP9KA|4.0|Fascinating flick. Special FX are OK and in line with Nolan's typical immersion in  darkness. Took a common theme and gave it a new edge. Curious to see all of the actors from Batman series.

B0009F9O08|5.0|When I first started listening to music in a serious way (age 12, 1976), the first two artists I got into were Bowie and the Beach Boys - how much further poles apart could you get??? I started via my eldest brother's record (pre-cd and better quality, believe it or not) collection - he's nine years older than me, so I thought he had the best collection ever seen. Anyway, I digress - he had three Bowie albums in his collection - Pinups, Young Americans, and David Live. You know when you hear an album that's been around for a while, and you think: \\"I know that song! And that one! etc, etc.\\" That's what it was like listening to these albums, especially, David Live. So much so, that I went out and bought my first album with my own money, a second-hand copy of Diamond Dogs (still my favourite album of all time); this album's featured extensively on David Live, as that was the tour promoting the album, though he recorded Young Americans in the middle of the tour and started featuring songs from that album after this recording was made. Still sounds great, especially the opening two tracks, and a great example of a greatest hits live recording. Not many double live albums can top this one, and any serious Bowie fan should have this in their collection - I should know, because I have just about every album recorded by him - and this is in my top 10 easily...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great improvement for Temple Run!  More scenes, better graphics, and ugly demon monkey! Can't get much better than this! If you liked Temple Run, you'll love Temple Run 2!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super fun and addictive game!!!  Can't believe it's free!  Love the \\"daily challenges \\" and the different themes such as New York & now Rio.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome. I never run out of things to do. Its kinda like temple run.  But I still love it. My brother even likes it and he is a teenager,so I highly recommend it.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've used this for a few high performance PC builds and to fix other things (most recently an Adonit Jot stylus that lost conductivity).<br />This product has a nice tip and design.  There is enough product in a syringe to last few several system builds.  If you are a hobbyist, this might last your whole life, so just buy it.
B00ARN0XGG|4.0|The movie was dull at points but scary enough to really enjoy the movie. Maybe not as good as the 3rd movie but close. A lot better then the 2nd movie.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|Bought this two years ago and still love it. It has a definite medieval vibe. Great music that goes into the rotation as soon as it gets cold and dark
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the first game I think I have become addicted to. I am a grandmother and I can't put it down. I keep trying to unlock the next character. Great fun.

B009P5S11G|2.0|Like my headline reads &#34;it's over rated&#34;.  Played the CD and really the only song I liked on it was Diamonds, but then by the end of the CD that is all the songs that she sings, but just in different version.  Boring!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was moving, entertaining, engaging; in short, it was hard to put down.  The author made you care about the characters and not just because they have cancer.  I am looking forward to reading other works by this author.
B0040GR01M|5.0|Awesome CD!<br />I've heard pretty much every song on this CD from various things. I finally just decided to buy the CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loove this game my dad and I keep having compititions<br /> It is so very fun I love this game
B007KDFWRG|3.0|Having seen the Tedeschi Trucks band on the 2010 Eric Clapton Crossroads DVD, I bought Revelator- which is a very good album.<br />I bought the \\"Everybody's Talkin\\" live CD based on the strength of the Crossroads work and Revelator- I listened to preview of a couple of the tracks which were debuted on Revelator, but played live. They sounded pretty good so I went ahead and bought the live album. I should have listened to the clips for all the music - as a lot of live recorded music, this album has some of what is tough for me- extended drum solos, fairly inaudible intros, and slow tracks. Gaps between songs are different if experienced live I guess. The last song on side 1 I cut out altogether when recording the CD to another medium.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I love the group, Susan is a great singer, and Derek is a great slide player. This album though just doesnt do it for me. I guess I can try to listen to it several times to see if it grows on me....
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book with good characters and not depressing like pillars of the Earth. I like the idea of keeping story going in the next book,looking forward to reading the second and third books. The history lesson was interesting and detailed and didn't seem to far left.

0316228532|5.0|Don't expect this book to be like Harry Potter.<br /><br />It begins with the sudden death of one of the members of the local council in a small modern-day British village, which creates what is known as a casual vacancy on the council. The contentious election that results to fill this position also acts as the vehicle for conflict between conservatives and liberals, the \\"upper class\\" and the \\"lower class,\\" husbands and wives, parents and children.  All of this culminates in a tragedy which forces everyone to reexamine their prejudices, their preconceptions, and their relationships with those closest to them.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is not a children's story, like the Harry Potter series started out as, although kids make up many of the primary characters. It's also not a happy story; again like the Harry Potter series, there is a dark undertone running all throughout this novel. It deals with issues that many of us don't like to confront: violence, poverty, drug and sexual abuse, death, as well as the small, petty jealousies and rivalries that make up much of all human relations. If you only like happy endings in your reading, then this is not the book for you. You'll probably also be disappointed in this book if you're offended by swearing and sex, although you should keep in mind that Rowling is writing about REAL LIFE in this novel, and swearing and sex are often part of real life, whether you like it or not.<br /><br />While it's a depressing novel in many ways, it's also strangely cathartic. You finish it with a satisfying sense of wanting to learn to appreciate the good things you've got, and maybe even to be more understanding toward those less fortunate. Just like some of the characters in the novel, we learn that even people we don't like are a mixture of good and bad and ultimately deserving of compassion.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|The Blu-ray edition of this movie is the very best way to see it at home! The details are astounding AND you get to actually see the Entire Movie! Not the Right wing clipped version in the theatres back when it came out... I still Do NOT see what the big issue was and why Right Wing Conserves pushed so hard for modification, the full version show nothing of any consequence other than the suggestion of mating between an alien male & female, never mind that they are merging with the creatures of their world all the time... Come on that's just so normal...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic story with a wonderfully different plot, full of twists and turns! I never expected Sky's mom to be who she was!

A must read and the kissing scenes are to die for!
0307887448|5.0|The year is 2044, the various wars between nations have resulted in a world of darkness, poverty and  danger. But OASIS provides the virtual world everyone escapes to. Virtual classrooms, virtual planets, avatars of your choosing, shopping malls, even virtual towns that resembled the towns in the 20th Century. And best of all, setting up an OASIS account is free.<br /><br />In this world enters Wade, whose avatar Parzival, goes to the OASIS public school on the planet Ludus. He has a best friend, Aech, a crush on Art3mis, and later meets Daito and Shoto, 2 Japanese avatars. The only thing they have in common is they're all avatars in OASIS, set on individual quests to earn credits that will allow them to make purchases for their online personas and level up to earn more talents and power.<br /><br />But OASIS was invented byJames Halliday, and upon his death, he broadcasts his will and issues a challenge to all. If anyone can find the 3 keys that will lead them through 3 Gates and they find the ultimate prize, an easter egg, that person will inherit the immense wealth accumulated by Halliday and OASIS.<br /><br />Needless to say this starts a race among gunters (egg hunters) who hunt individually or in clans. But there's an evil corporation, IOI, who have teams of Sixters, employees tasked with finding this Egg which will give IOI total control over OASIS, which they want to turn into a fee-based service.<br /><br />The hunt is made more difficult because all gunters need to understand Halliday, an eccentric recluse who loved everything about the 1980s. The entire book is filled with wonderful references to video games and arcade games popular in the 80s, books, movies, tv series and music of the 80s.  Lyrics and scripts are cleverly woven into the quest. In addition, the IOI appear to stop at nothing to find the ultimate prize, even murder.<br /><br />But underneath all the nostalgia for the 80s, as with any good quest, our protagonist has to learn through his mistakes and about human relationships, that the online world is fantasy and that there is a real world out there that he should learn to enjoy as well.

1936891026|1.0|The content of this book makes it abundantly clear that he did little or no research to resist or challenge his ideas before writing. From the first page, he makes one outrageous and completely false claim after another.<br /><br />QUOTES FROM THE BOOK:<br /><br /> --- \\"Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet. It is the root of more unhappiness than poverty, disease, and erectile dysfunction.\\"<br /><br />--- \\"Resistance is evil.\\"<br /><br />--- \\"Resistance is the enemy within.\\"<br /><br />These quotes are so utterly ridiculous, I can hardly believe this book got published.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF RESISTANCE<br /><br />How can people believe such obvious untruths?  Here's my view of resistance.<br /><br />--- Resistance IS NOT inherently evil.  Resistance is our GIFT.  It's the source of all Free will. Without resistance we would all be obedient little robots.<br /><br />--- Resistance is often trying to PROTECT and defend your rights, not HURT you.<br /><br />--- Resistance is REQUIRED to develop your ability to think both creatively and critically. It's necessary to not believe everything you hear or see.<br /><br />--- Resistance is our inner wisdom trying to get our attention nonverbally.<br /><br />THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF RESISTANCE<br /><br />Resistance (when it comes to writing) is more like our inner wisdom asking us to be less rigid and be more creative at finding ways to inspire ourselves to write and to increase the quality of our ideas.<br /><br />Writing is a process.  If Steven wrote this hunk of misleading, oversimplistic, and untrue ideas by forcing himself to sit down and start writing at 9am everyday - well, no wonder it sucks.<br /><br />Good writing requires doing much more than sitting down at a computer at 9am every day!<br /><br />It requires nurturing your ideas and challenging them as well.  It requires reading, thinking and engaging with other people.  It requires listening to \\"resistance\\" to your ideas.  Resistance challenges us to think deeper and not be a parrot of outdated cultural myths and metaphors.<br /><br />Most Inner Resistance needs to be listened to, if you listen and respond respectfully it often melts.  If you can't respond, then you are challenged to either learn, question your assumptions, redesign your strategies, or rethink your own ideas.<br /><br />The more you fight resistance, the more it goes underground and becomes even stronger.<br /><br />--- Resistance is what fueled the American Revolution.  If England had LISTENED and allowed us to have a voice in our own taxation, we might still be part of England.<br /><br />--- Resistance is how we respond to disrespect and tyranny.<br /><br />--- Resistance is how we respond to abuse.<br /><br />Clearly, his military background not only broke his inner resistance, it broke his ability to embrace the gifts of resistance and to develop the miracle of having an opposable mind - the central ingredient to being able to learn.  Our ability to resist is one of the most wondrous aspects of being human.<br /><br />ALTERNATIVE METAPHORS FOR ART<br /><br />Take some time to learn more about the potential value of resistance and art does NOT have to be war.<br /><br />--- Art can be a \\"dance\\" with life and the \\"gardening\\" of high quality ideas.<br /><br />--- Art can be an adventure in getting to know ourselves and cultivating self-respect, self-confidence, and humility.<br /><br />--- Art can teach us leadership by consensus-building.  It can challenge us and inspire us to cultivate inner alignment instead of trying to dominate ourselves.<br /><br />WAR IS THE REAL SELF-DEFEATING STRATEGY<br /><br />When you \\"defeat\\" one part of yourself...that is the REAL act of self-sabotage.  Thinking you having an enemy inside is a recipe for depression, anxiety, frustration, and wasting ridiculous amounts of energy fighting that could have been spent listening and learning.<br /><br />Steven, if you read this piece of resistance to the ideasin your book, I wonder:  Will you think I'm evil for challenging you to rethink your whole metaphor?
1451626657|2.0|I wasn't too excited to start this book. I had to read it with my class at school and, well, we usually don't read very good novels. This one was...okay. The entire novel was a satire-making fun of war. There were a few parts that really made me laugh, but sometimes the book seemed to drag on and on with the corny jokes! And sometimes it didn't make sense just because the author didn't feel like making sense in order to prove a point. I know that's a certain style, but it irks me.<br />I liked how the characters were well defined, if annoying at times. I know, I know-they're supposed to be this way. I'm just not used to reading any book like this one.<br />I'm giving \\"Catch 22″ 2/5 stars: 1 star for the fact that it made me laugh [sometimes], and the other for the combination of it being a classic book [then it must be good enough for people to read XD] and having great characters.
1938469011|5.0|Stan Hiereonymus does justice!  This is the best book on hops that I have read.  It is a great book written for the masses.  Well done Stan.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|So far so good but I've only had the app for a few days. Energy seems to deplete rather quickly &amp; I don't know yet how quickly it will regenerate. My 12yr old son really enjoys it.
B0042RJWTM|4.0|I own the DVD and just recently watched it again. Does anybody besides me notice that Marvin's mustache comes and goes without much recognition as to why? Maybe you just assume he shaved, but as scenes evolve, the sense of it just doesn't make it, at least to me anyway. Aside from that, this film is a wonderfully done sentiment about the closing of the old west and Marvin and company are just the ones to make it an endearing film all these years later. A sweet revenge film too when Marvin tames the old grey! Best bronc rider in the west....ever!
B007KLY8FA|4.0|This review is specifically for the sound quality of the transfers.  Ahmad Jamal's performance on these recordings rates 5+ stars minimum!<br /><br />I've purchased a number of these Real Gone Jazz cd sets in the last few weeks and have mostly been happy with them.  I see it as an inexpensive way to finally purchase much of my lp collection on CD.  However, this one disappointed me.  I was willing to accept the fact that some of the albums might be vinyl transfers, but in this set the transfers were particularly bad.  I'll try to list the LPs covered on this set below and rate the transfers:<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />Count 'em 88 - Mono vinyl transfer.  Sounds is ok, but surprised they couldn't find a cleaner copy of this album.<br /><br />Ahmad Jamal Trio at the Spotlight Cafe - Mix of mono and stereo.  Sounds like a cd transfer.  Very nice!<br /><br />Disc 2:<br /><br />But Not For Me - Sounds like a mono CD rip.  Sound is perfectly acceptable to my ears.<br /><br />Jamal at the Penthouse - This album was why I bought this set in the first place.  Imagine how disappointed I was to hear that it was a very poor vinyl transfer and MONO to boot!  Even my thrashed copy of this album is in better shape than what they used for this transfer.  Boo!<br /><br />Disc 3:<br /><br />Happy Moods - Sounds like a CD rip.  Stereo?  Perfectly acceptable to my ears.<br /><br />All of You - Sounds like a stereo CD rip.  Very acceptable to my ears.<br /><br />Disc 4:<br /><br />Chamber Music of the New Jazz - Sound to me like a CD rip.  It is in Mono.  Works for me!<br /><br />Standard Eyes - OK lp rip of the mono album.  Definitely could have done better myself.<br /><br />Overall I was satisfied with the set.  However, there were several albums that were in my opinion substandard lp transfers.  I feel this set is worth the pittance I paid for it, but I want others to know what to expect.  I'll definitely continue to purchase the Real Gone Jazz sets!

B00AREIAI8|3.0|well I think its great but kinds boring if I do say so myself<br />yeah and unman bye then thats all I have to say

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I played this app on my sisters phone and really liked it but it wont download on my kindle fire!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this really is a fun game and I think anyone who plays will enjoy it -  it's so very good for the mind and it helps to stimulate your thoughts
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It seemed to be a little nicer then the first version. I am still stuck with only one hand to wake it all work, but it looked very nice. As it gets with me, maybe I can get it better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My g-daughters love playing this game. But am concerned about what message this game gives. An avatar who runs from the law after spray painting trains.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|\\"I'm A Rider\\" has been playing in my mind all day today!  Yesterday it was \\"Dream.\\"  That's the effect this album has had on me.<br /><br />I first met songwriter-of-the-year winner Gary Burr when I took his song writing seminar.  I also had the opportunity to play in an amateur band that he directed.  These experiences left a lasting impression.  Naturally, when the Blue Sky Riders came to town this summer, I made it a point to see them.  Their musicianship and incredible harmonies blew me away.<br /><br />Gary's, Georgia's and Kenny's voices blend beautifully.  Their songs, country rock with an emphasis on \\"rock,\\" are very well written.  Their backing band creates strong, driving rhythms.  (I was especially impressed by the lead guitarist.)  In addition, they play a nice mix of upbeat songs and ballads.<br /><br />If you like country rock music, you will love this album.
1250010489|5.0|I have just finished reading the excellent Trojan Horse by Mark Russinovich. This book is outstanding and highly recommended. Having read many of the thrillers written by authors like Vince Flynn, Brad Thor and others, I rate Russinovich's work right up there with them. If you want the enjoyment of a fast-paced, gripping, timely, page turning thriller then Trojan Horse is spot on.<br /><br />Even more compelling is the narrative and subject area - cyberterrorism. Russinovich is in a unique position to speak on this subject - he is a brilliant computer scientist, a Microsoft Fellow and has extensive experience with the technologies that so much of our world now depend on. He even spent some time with the amazing Windows experts at NuMega. This has provide him with an inside perspective on what is happening and the challenges we face. Mark explains the technical aspects of cyber hacking at a high level, enough to educate but not too much to take away from the story line.<br /><br />The reports this week about hackers inside of the NY Times web site and the attack on Twitter speak to just how timely this subject is.<br /><br />I have already picked up and started readying Mark's first book - Zero Day! Looking forward to his next book as well.<br /><br />As I said in the headline - read this book for fun or read it to get a better understanding of the issue of cyberterrorism. Just do yourself a favor and read it!<br /><br />Bob<br /><br />@rvobrien
B0091REZMW|1.0|you cant get past the first few rooms unless your willing to shell out a lot of money. you need diamonds for everything but they are almost impossible to get. so you have to spend real money to buy them. its 1.99 or 2.99 or some crap like that for 20 of them. 20 of them don't go far at all. so if you want to get anywhere in this game expect to spend A LOT of money. this game is a money pit and its not even that great anyway. don't waste your money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game it is so much better than temple run I wish that every body should like this game as me
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is completely awesome, I have it on My kindle fire, Xbox, and PC. Just a awesome game and my PC username is Firestar999 but this game is portable so I can play on the road.
0770435726|5.0|In The Expats by Chris Pavone we are given delicious clues right from the start that Kate Moore is more than she seems. When Kate's husband, Dexter, is offered a lucrative position with an unnamed bank in Luxembourg, Kate quits her job in Washington D.C., the details of which (she's CIA) she never totally explained to Dexter, and they decide to pack up their sons and become expats, Americans living and working abroad.<br /><br />While Kate thinks, at first, that she is leaving her double life behind to concentrate on being a wife and mother, it soon becomes clear that she has developed some skills that could still be useful to her since everything in Luxembourg may not be quite what it seems to be. Dexter is becoming increasingly distant and might be hiding something from her. And then there is a couple they have met who don't seem to be who they claim they are.<br /><br />As the tension slowly begins to build, clues foreshadow that there is much more to the story: \\"Much later, Kate realized that Chicago should have been her first clue. (page 48).\\" The Expats is full of clues and hints like this of much more to come... and the secrets, all the secrets and half-truths being hidden from others..<br /><br />In fact, this stylish and cerebral espionage novel is about secrets, people keeping secrets wrapped up in other secrets. It's not a novel full of violent gun battles and fight scenes. Instead it is an intelligent novel where we are allowed glimpses and tantalizing clues of what might be the real truth, only to have these new revelations dashed  aside as new clues are revealed. This is a long-con (and as a Lost fan, I appreciate a great long-con story.)<br /><br />The writing was superb. The narrative alternates between the present and the past, both in chronological order, giving us clues and information slowly and subtly. This really makes for a complex, cleverly plotted novel. I started The Expats and could hardly set it down. At page 250 if I didn't have an early meeting the next morning, I would have been sorely tempted to stay up way-too-late to finish this novel, something I really can't say very often anymore.<br /><br />I thought Chris Pavone did a tremendous job developing Kate's character and taking us along as we slowly learned what was really going on. While there have been some complaints about the ending, I thought it was great, full of unanticipated twists, and perfectly fit the whole tone of the novel.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended - I thoroughly enjoyed this novel!<br /><br />Disclosure: I received an advanced reading copy of this book from Crown Publishing Group and TLC for review purposes.meeting the next morning, I would have been sorely tempted to stay up way-too-late to finish this novel, something I really can't say very often anymore.<br /><br />I thought Chris Pavone did a tremendous job developing Kate's character and taking us along as we slowly learned what was really going on.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is so fun and addicting  and it so deserves a 5 star review soooo fun and free  and It's for all ages. I recommend it if you like temple run then you'll love this app.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say I was one of the late bloomers. I didnt read this until after ALL my friends did. I was like oh whats the hype its just sex in a book. well thats what everyone thinks until they read the story. There is an actual love story, though tormented, sad, troubled, dark, and kinky, it was a REAL story. It drew me in from page 1. I felt like it was something that had substance. I have read my fair share of romace novels, boy meets girl, hes been abused, shes been abused, high school lovers, etc... this one tho was diffrent, very diffrent. I felt like it was something I could really picture in my head. I SAW Christian and Ana, and Taylor too. I think taylor has to be one of my fav side characters. Christians \\"fifty shades\\" were well told and really made me feel for the guy, fictional or not. I think that people who genuinly enjoy reading will like and enjoy these series. its not about the writing styles, or the silly BS everyones negative reviews are about. Just have an open mind and heart and this will fill both for you. the sex is good, sometimes I felt a little dirtier reading the pages but in all I have to say i enjoyed the books, borrowed the paperback and then bought my own copies on my kindle. i will have Christian and Ana forever.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better graphics and performance, and even more fun to play than the first. I love the power ups and that big mean monkey!
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|I gave it as a gift, and having seen it in a theater I am sure that it deserves 5 stars.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Although I have watched almost of the HBO shows to date I was still unclear on some of the relationshiips and other details and reading the book clarified things and now I'm even more eager for the new shows to air.
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|Its an amazing story and hard to believe this still happens in the 21st century. I can recommend it to everyone who is intersted to know more about North Korea.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I was suprised to see this app hit the store a few days ago. I instantly downloaded it and was happy to see that the graphics were much better than the first game. But I was slightly dissapointed because the app sometimes lags on the opening screen. All in all, I rate this app 4 stars.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I was Inspired by the sci-fi novel Blindsight to find something along the same lines, so I found this book highly rated Kindle store. I Hadn't heard of it before. It was a very nice read.<br /><br />Fictional near-future Mars mission, where due to an accident in a dust storm forcing an early abort of the mission, one of the crew is left behind. Most of the story is first-person log entries by the stranded crewman, who works on day to day survival tasks with the equipment left behind. To me, it was really interesting exploration on the idea of what it might take to practically live and work on another planet where you need space suits, have no source of water and no way to contact Earth. For those who believe in the eventual colonization of space, the book is mostly good news I would think.<br /><br />I liked that every time something goes wrong it's not exactly instantaneous death, so the hero has some chance to come up with quick fixes and solutions, (no exploding heads). On the other hand, just when you think things are going well, something else goes wrong, which did get a little too repetitive as a plot device.<br /><br />One aspect that didn't work for me was too much of the &#34;wise-cracking, hands-on engineer geeks rebel against NASA pencil-pushing suits&#34; trope. It felt too easy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game!  One of the best game I have played so far!  I'm not a person who plays games but I find myself picking up my kindle on almost all of my spare time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is really fun to play. I love Temple Run  and Temple Run 2. Great idea with making the ropes swing like that! You guys all did an excellent job. I sure will recommend it to all of my friends!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i kind of like subway surfers its an addictive game and a nice change the only problem is that sometimes the game does stall and it is like temple run but overall a good game.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I personally have dealt with the horror of a child victimized by a child molester, I closed my eyes and ears were closed to any positive thing about Michael Jackson for years.  I quit listening to his music, I felt sorry for his kids--I assumed they'd grow up tortured.<br /><br />This book, gave me a perspective that I had not thought about before.  Not being rich and famous, I would not have been able to realize what he'd been through or the life he lead without researching it thoroughly.  This author does that for us, and presents her work in a readable and sympathetic manner.  Michael Jackson becomes human again, as you realize he probably wasn't the monster he was made out to be.<br /><br />I ended up feeling sad for Mr. Jackson for all that he must have missed in life, and I admired him for how much he tried to protect his children and give them a 'normal' life.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I could not put it down.  Great read for young adults. I would recommend this book for all women to read.
B008LA7RMK|4.0|This might be the last CD I need in my ultimate Collection beach Boys and summer Surf Music With exellent sound and your chose of ten STEREO&lt; Songs or ten MONO Songs I always considered myself a audiofile sort of guy , but I still don't care, for Mono, if I can get true Stereo versions of my Music,  Well this CD should make everybody happy.  I thought I read somewhere that Brian Wilson, Helped with the remixing of these new versions to Stereo, Well it shure sounds like it was done right,  You should check these out , Get a start on that new Summer Soundtrack while crusing down the road, this Summer
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is a great scary app it's kinda easy but it's fun it's the best app of the game yet I hope there is a chapter two wish that they would take the other junky slender games off so more people could know to buy this one
B004LROUNG|5.0|Starts off a little slow but builds to &#34;a can't put it down&#34; regular Grisham climax.  Ends well...a good read.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good, can't wait to start the next one, didn't want it to end the way it did, made me sad

B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, I was so into it.  Now, I can start reading the third Hunger Games book and then I want to see the movie.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Used with a classic Ipod.  It connected to a portable bluetooth radio and to a car stereo with bluetooth.  Nice low profile.  I would give it 5 stars if I could charge the Ipod at the same time.  Good for a few hours.  You have to remember to unplug it if you want the Ipod to go to sleep.
B00338QENI|4.0|The book was very interesting.  I had never heard about the cells and it happened in my lifetime.  I just think too much time was spent on talking about the cells.  Am sure people in the medical field would enjoy this book more than I did.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|You can't see which pieces have been taken. I know it's not all that difficult to figure out, but I'd much rather just glance at the side/bottom of the screen then have to think through which pieces are still on the board.<br /><br />I also was hoping for online multiplayer, but it is a free product, so I can't really complain about that.
0307477479|5.0|After just putting down the book, I checked the online reviews and was surprised by the reservations that many other readers have expressed. I don't read novels nearly as much as I used to (many disappointments do end up bringing you down!) but this book struck me as absolutely great. It's beautifully written, it's amazingly original, in structure and voice as well as in its characterizations, and I actually feel a little different for having read it. I can't fully express my admiration for Jennifer Egan's accomplishment, so now I'm off in search of anything else she has written. There is an effort factor involved in this book (you can't bail on the Powerpoint chapter, for example) but if you're interested in return, you're in the money with this one. It is really something.
B0073PPKNM|2.0|I was passionately awaiting her new album. Gardot got terribly bad advice from a pompous Brazilian. Thus, instead of hearing her own wonderful creative instinct became a mediocre national geographic musical tour. Additionally, she is merchandise now; well marketed and marketing Piaget as well. Congratulations on the commercial success, truly. Yet I am so disappointed in her new direction. Please be free again to be Gardot.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very good and it feels so real.  I never knew that taking care of a horse required so muff time and energy. Love it and reccomend it!!

B0050SYS5A|5.0|i had a problem of it not working propperly and so this i was told would fix the problem and it did just that , works great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is truly addictive. I play it everywhere I go. It is much more difficult and fun than Temple Run 1. Plus, it's free!
B003CHGV74|5.0|This show is a great watch. Takes you for a wild ride and just keeps on giving a very compelling story.
B004SBX112|1.0|I purchased this for my grandson to play and I thought it said it would work on my Kindle.  Obviously, it doesn't.  Must only download to an android device.  I told Amazon, but haven't heard anything.  I'm not out much, but my grandson was disappointed!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Clever approach to understanding troubled children. I have a son with Aspberger's syndrome and could totally understand the difficulty raising a child like Kevin. They are often not properly diagnosed or mis-diagnosed. I was totally unprepared for the ending! Liked the book so much that I rented the movie. Didn't like the casting of the parents, but Kevin was spot on
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is really fun, I like all the l little side things that you have to figure out. It entertaining and a good way to pass the time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy to play, even my daughter can play &amp; she loves it! Easy to lose track of time while playing:)
0756404738|5.0|This book will keep you interested from cover to cover. With the spinning of a fascinating yarn the author has managed to capture and hold the attention of the reader. What a good first novel.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I had never heard of him before I saw a documentary on him.  The music is wonderful, but the download thing was a pain.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because it works offline and  is very entertaining. [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition) this should help you find the fun time of the boring car rides. P.s. it is very addictive.
B009R6OTI2|2.0|I have the online version . Lessons that are downloaded can not view.  I wasted 25$ . I wish they would send me the DVD. Wishful thinking.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This a great family movie with a good message.  Just can't stop watching it!  It does a great job of highlighting the conflict and resolution of Mother/Daughter relationships during the teen years.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game was fun but it won't load anymore.  I keep pressing it, but it refuses to load. I've uninstalled it and it worked again, but I lost all of my progress. I'm uninstalling it for good this time.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Game randomly force quits when you use a Save Me jewel. Ending a high scoring game, taking the jewel credit, points and coins away. It's annoying enough to stop playing because you can't progress without using the jewels.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|ok, so this is completely a guilty pleasure for me!! I bought this book, read it, and within 3-4 weeks I had bought and read the other 7 books that have been published so far.  I just couldn't put it down... such a page turner.
B00AE2I4B6|3.0|Did not think that the dancing was as good in this one. Story was OK, just could of had better dance scenes.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|This 'extended version' was great, as I had not seen the deleted scenes before.  This was the start of the series, which ran for 10 years.  Good movie!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the most passive games I have ever played! I just can't stop playing and if I had the time would play for hours if I could! I would recommend it to people who like these type of games and have a little free time on their hands.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to begin. This book is so unbelievable amazing. What do you read after a book like this. I'm at a loss for words. I think I'll go out and gaze at the night sky to try and figure out what my next book will be. It's going to be very hard to top this one.

B0059XTV4Y|5.0|By modern American standards, our modern-day heroine, Wally, married a prince. She's not yet thirty and married to a psychiatrist who keeps her in luxury--and behaves as if he owns her. He ignores her, abuses her, cheats on her, and won't let her spend his money or earn her own. He is wholly unsympathetic with her attempts at starting a family (she shoots up fertility drugs on the sly). And his name begins with a \\"W\\"--as did that of the Duchess of Windsor's abusive first husband, Win Spencer.<br /><br />Wally was named after Wallis Simpson, and has internalized the message that a \\"great love\\" will make life into a bowl of cherries. Wally is a former Sotheby's employee who, after a six-year absence, starts hanging around Sotheby's when they feature the Windsors' possessions in 1998. In the meantime, she rekindles a neglected work friendship. Her white-collar friend, Tenten, chides Wally about her desire to be back at Sotheby's, working for \\"no\\" money. Enter a new, BLUE-collar Sotheby's friend: a security guard. And his name begins with an \\"E\\"--as did that of Wallis' loving and beloved second husband, Ernest Simpson.<br /><br />Wally goes into daydreams (that just might have a psychic element) while admiring and handling the Windsors' possessions, and thus she lives though early 20th-century scenes in Wallis' life. A couple of times, Wallis Simpson talks to her. In due course, Wally secures permission to read some of the Duchess' unpublished letters, and learns that Wallis really loved and wanted to keep her second husband. (This is the belief of Anne Sebba, author of THAT WOMAN, a recent Wallis Windsor biography.) Wally starts to see parallels between her marriage and Wallis' disastrous first one.<br /><br />Madonna, as director and writer, postulates that the premarital relationship between Edward and Wallis was chaste. Most people think this is preposterous, but it's what Edward claimed. Madonna runs with it. The relationship between Wally and her security guard ischaste, too, as long as her marriage really lasts.<br /><br />There are errors of fact that I can't help believing are deliberate: A fake newsreel that refers to George V as George III and refers to Edward VIII as having been \\"crowned.\\" But Madonna knows her material, and I think that in a fine-tuned labor of love like this, such errors are meant to show the deafness and crudeness of the press.<br /><br />Most of us know something of the Edward/Wallis story, but too many know too little. Therefore, I should be less astounded than I am at the critics who don't get this movie. They literally don't understand what the auteur is trying to say. This is a symmetrical work of art with a definite point of view. Madonna does not HAVE to be right in all her facts; indeed, some can only be guessed at. She chooses her interpretation like a historical novelist.<br /><br />I have not come close to doing justice to all the strands in this lovely cobweb of a movie.
1449410243|5.0|I originally bought this as a gift for a friend who has a cat named Bob.  Thought she would get a laugh about the &#34;Bob&#34; in the book.  I just couldn't resist reading it before I passed it on as I'm a cat person, too.  He hits the nail on the head many times describing how cats think.  So far, all my cats love me enough not to have such thoughts.
B000002OOY|5.0|My recollection is that this score was damned with faint praise when the film itself was first released. Many judged this to be very minor John Williams at best. I'm not quite sure why. The main theme rarely fails to bring a tear to my eye, and when it's used in the film at the first appearance of a live dinosaur, I always lose it. The nobility of sentiment it expresses is, well, just too much for words. If there's one criticism I would have of this album it is that that main theme really overpowers everything else on the disc. Some tracks are variations on the theme, and this leads to a kind of sonic addiction, so that one keeps wanting the next segment to have the theme in it. In a way that's a testament to the power of the main theme, but it also is a shame in a way, because the other music on this disc is by turns ominous, bouncy and adventure-y, good stuff taken on its own terms. Oh well, I'm digressing badly. Suffice it to say that I think this is a fine score, particularly that main theme. I think it's time to cry again....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very very fun....I love it!! it has a lot of games and fun stuff to play on it....it gets harder as you unlock new games
B0000029PC|5.0|This Schumann symphonic set has long been one of the standards by which others have been compared. It was the first set of these works I ever owned -- or heard, for that matter -- back in the Age of Vinyl. Among modern instrument big band versions, it still ranks up there in the elite circle, though I would by this later date add a few more -- the vintage cycle conducted by Sawallisch but as it is heard on the Schumann bicentennial orchestral compilation from EMI and Dausgaard's recordings with smaller forces on BIS are two that deserve consideration, and there are a host of other sets that deserve to sit nearby as well: Haitink's, Solti's and Masur's (with the Gewandhaus Orchestra). And though it's not complete, the Schumann symphonic recordings of Celibidache on EMI are to be recommended, particularly the No. 3. Whew. And that's just the modern instrument crew. For period performances, I'd pick the hard to find set from the Hanover Band with Roy Goodman conducting over John Eliot Gardiner's renditions, frankly. But in all this digression George Szell has been lost, so let's briefly return to him. This performances are direct and straightforward, and although my understanding is that the conductor still did some tweaking with the scores, there is no clutter here -- these renditions have a sharpness and bite to them, and Szell's analytical approach gives a sense of rigor that serves as a frame on which the emotion is laid out and allowed to breathe. These aren't the best recordings of the Schumann symphonies any more; I don't know that any one set is. But certainly these performances remain one of the best. By far.
1432794426|5.0|Well Written! Well Researched! Well Done! Thank you for giving us a true insight into one of the most talented pop icon's of our time. BRAVO!
B0001RVTXO|5.0|You gotta love this CD.  It has all their good songs on it.  This is a good CD, and I recommend it highly
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The Presidents Club was a fascinating read. In our time of such devisive politics it was heartening to see how the club of our ex presidents still work together. All behaved differently but most followed the dictum that the best way for the ex chiefs to continue to serve their country is by helping the current President. The realization that only another President can truly understand the job breaks down the party lines and let's the current president rule more effectively. This was a great read.
B005PK553C|4.0|The series starts off a little slow but stick with it. There are a lot of characters that keeps it interesting. the acting is well done
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A really fun game to play if your bored. I really like this game and I hope u like it too. :)
B009VB97EY|2.0|Although I usually enjoy Channing Tatum movies, the story and characterizations were poor.  Very predictable. I would not recommend to others.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This novel requires patience.  When I first \\"heard\\" Pat Peoples` voice, I thought, who is this?  It takes time to care about Pat and his world view, which is very limited.  But that is just Pat, and once you put yourself in the mindset of a mentally ill Eagles fan with a screwed up family you will be okay.  His therapist/Eagles buddy is terrific fun.  I had seen the movie first, which was a bit more lighthearted and faster to the punchline.  I wish the character of Tiffany had been more developed, because I just wanted Jennifer Lawrence to pop from the pages.  I would recommend this book because of its tremendous compassion for mental illness, which one rarely finds told through the voice of the mentally ill (except in memoir).  This a great story of a man, his family,and his loved ones who come together to support him for as long as he needs.  If this was a story about cancer we would not be surprised by the support, but here, with two mentally ill friends and the families who want nothing but to best for them, we see the patience and the love that goes along with loving the mentally ill, and how that love gives the beneficiaries a chance for a beautiful life.
B000VHPXR2|5.0|From the time the movie came out I have love it. I remember nuns picketing at the movie theater. That made my mother a fan before we even got to our seats! Fabulous stuff!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|But it is very annoying that it automatically changed to Rio but it is very fun the first one was the best
0375869026|5.0|If every 10-yo child (and perhaps every adult) read this book, the world would ultimately be a kinder place. Splendid.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I wasn't really big on this app until i realized that all the music i had purchased from Amazon was put on my 'cloud' and I didn't have to do a thing. It really does make purchasing music easier. I can buy the song and once it's in my cloud, I have access to it from whatever device I use - my tablet, my pc, my laptop or my smartphone. MUCH nicer than having to add the music manually to all of those devices.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book because it entertaining and funny. You are an awesome writer I've read all of your books. They are all a 5 star ratings

B008ASGP3U|4.0|&#34;Standing in Another Man's Grave&#34;  was a good read, kept me guessing to the last page.  Characters were interesting, enjoyed especially because had read earlier Inspector Rebus books and liked revisiting the characters and setting.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I'm a Windows software developer, but I just bought a MacBook Air to try. It's a slick machine but has no Ethernet port. It does have two USB 3.0 ports however.<br /><br />I setup RealVNC so I can remotely access my MacBook from my Windows machines, but since it was using a wireless connect, it was a bit slow. This device \\"came to the rescue\\" with a fast wired connection. Wired is not just faster, it doesn't clog up the wireless spectrum and isn't subject to interference like wireless connections always are, so going wired is a SIGNIFICANT improvement for my needs.<br /><br />I followed another reviewer's helpful advice - \\"Do a search for \\"ASIX AX88179 OS X driver\\", download, install, reboot, connect, profit!\\" and it worked perfectly. I just plugged it in and wired it up and had a much faster connection (using USB 3.0 and gigabit Ethernet) to my notebook. I really like stuff that just works.<br /><br />Of course the device also works with USB 2.0, though speeds will be limited to USB 2.0's max speed of 480 Mbit/s (with effective throughput up to 280 Mbit/s), but that's still significantly faster than real-world wireless speeds.<br /><br />The adapter itself is compact and very lightweight, and has three LEDs on it: 1) red for a USB 3.0 connection, 2) green to indicate data transfer, and 3) blue to indicate a working Ethernet connection. The 18 months (instead of the usual 12 months) warranty is also a plus.<br /><br />A similar product to also consider (though a bit bulkier) is: [[ASIN:B00AYLIVEC Satechi USB 3.0 to 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN Network Adapter for Windows XP, Vista, 7 & Mac OSX 9 or higher]]<br /><br />So, a definite 5 stars from me. Should I run into any issues, then I'll update this review.<br /><br />UPDATE 2013-02-20: I bought another unit for a Dell XPS 12 but it turned out to be bad and I had to send it back. Either I just got strangely unlucky or there may be some quality issues. If you get one that doesn't work though, and got it through Amazon fulfillment, then it's easy to send it back.<br /><br />UPDATE 2013-04-01: Lately, I've been using this with my Dell XPS 12 with Window 8 (instead of my MacBook) and it has been performing flawlessly.Amazon fulfillment, then it's easy to send it back.<br /><br />UPDATE 2013-04-01: Lately, I've been using this with my Dell XPS 12 with Window 8 (instead of my MacBook) and it has been performing flawlessly.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Note that this review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />American Horror Story takes a cliched theme, a haunted house, and completely flips it on its head.<br /><br />The acting is superb, especially Connie Britton. She of Friday Night Lights fame was a big reason why I decided to give this series a shot. And she didn't disappoint. Neither did any of the other actors. And if they had, this series would have fallen flat on its back.<br /><br />It has an intriguing beginning set in the past that grips you immediately as two young boys walk in a house, and a young girl, clearly mentally challenged, tells them they will die if they walk inside. Then it shifts to the present with a woman (Britton) who catches her cheating husband in the act. They move to California for a fresh start, as a way to repair what seems like a broken marriage; he cheated on her because she couldn't be intimate after a miscarriage. I believe the average viewer will consider the husband both a vile and sympathetic character, especially as the season progresses. His torment grows over time, exacerbated by the emergence of a house guest, who appears an aging, wrinkled mess to women, but as a sexy fantasy-completing maid to men.<br /><br />As the season progresses the questions that arise from the first several episodes are slowly fleshed out, almost as they would be in a good novel, in the form of a slow burn that makes you want to run every episode on loop. By the mid-point of the season I had called one of the punchlines, but I really had no idea how it was going to end. I had a hunch, and part of that theory panned out, but this series will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />It's less gore and more psychological thriller; Rosemary's Baby crossed with the House on Haunted Hill and the Sixth Sense, it's a series that will surely give you nightmares, and stick with you many days after you've finished.<br /><br />The bottom line: if paranormal thrillers are your thing, mixed in with some soap opera-ish drama, this series is worth exploring.<br /><br />-Raeden Zensoap opera-ish drama, this series is worth exploring.<br /><br />-Raeden Zen
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I was really skeptical, but this book succeeds as a novel and as an introduction to DevOps. I'm going to recommend we get it for my whole team.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have always loved Nicholas spark books and this is definitely worth making into the movie it has become. I definitely recommend this book.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Love it just because it's a good Christmas Story that really took me to the places where these characters are located (don't want to spoil the story).  But then again, I'm a hopeless romantic.  :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This final book of the Hunger Games kept me turning the pages. The introduction of new interesting characters really kept my interest to see what part they had to play. Also the ending was quite a surprise. The story parallels what is going on in our world today if you think about it.<br />Loved the series.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I watched this with my 8 year old granddaughter. We both enjoyed it immeasurably.  We both laughed out loud at the pigs dancing and swimming. Great story. Wouldn't mind seeing another one.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|terrific plot,  great actors,  just a fun movie to watch overall.  Probably one of the best superhero movies ive seen in 10 years
B00AMBH70S|4.0|When I heard that Matt Damon didn't want to do another Bourne movie I truly thought the franchise was over. Then enters Jeremy Renner, who I only remembered from the movie [[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 Marvel's The Avengers]]. I didn't think anyone else could pull the franchise, but I must admit that he did an awesome job! The movie was really good! It had action, excitement, and a very good plot. All I know is that I can't wait to see what happens in the next installment.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This movie does not live up to it's predecessor.  A trend one may find in modern film is to make a film long in order to create a sense of &#34;epicness&#34;.  Sadly, this film does a better job of creating a sense of boredness.  I feel this film suffers from a story line that just doesn't have what it takes to make it a contender in my mind. It's either that, or the fact that the editors seemed to love the story so much that they allowed their final product to drag a relatively uninspired plot to drag on nearly three hours.<br /><br />The acting in the film was great, which is why I still give the film three stars.  Anne Hathaway plays her character very well. I don't think Michael Caine could have been a better choice for his character, and he plays it to perfection.  Christian Bale of course plays a solid Batman... I just don't understand the choice to use the peculiar i-just-tried-firebreathing-for-the-first-time-and-it-didnt-go-well voice he uses when he dons the cape.
B0078QYI1G|4.0|I have developed a taste for Bluegrass, Folk, blues, But rare do you get to hear a combo of all three on the same CD. What great job this band does delivering  this, even with a touch of country coming through. I dont know how to explane the gener, except to say it is just good music to listen to.
B00136Q342|1.0|It pains me to give this four star album 1 star. The wonderful world of the mp3 and our amazing technology has failed the most simple and basic rule of a live recording. A live recording is continous. Each song ends in chatting and applause but is cut when the track ends leaving a 3 second silence between each song. Come on tech geeks, get it fixed.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|it is a great game but the game crashes very regularly.  this happens when I use a &quot;save life&quot;. this drive me nuts because instead of getting a new best score, I lose my diamonds and ends up with a negative balance. I'm relieved that I don't buy coins, otherwise i'd get mad. otherwise this would be a great game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I am loving this app! I was scared at first that it wouldn't work while the kindle was locked, but I tested it and it worked :) Now I have an alarm clock with me where ever I go, so I wont rely on other people. It has a few great sound options too as well as the weather.

B0063IH60K|3.0|I love solitaire - this version has a pop up screen (full screen) ad EVERY SINGLE random hand.  Ads can be on bottom and rather obscure or at least out of way a bit.  These full screen ads to like on mobility, facebook, twitter along with match.com ads, personal questions and others have me searching for another solitaire game to play iver this one.  Sorry.  I know the games are free and need to be paid for some how, but the &quot;in your face &quot; style of every hand is overkill.<br /><br />Not recommended for those hating pop ups - even easily rid of type.<br /><br />Christine
B009E3EY38|5.0|Those old guys (I'm old too) can still rock better than anyone else. I was so happily surprised by the performance.<br />Jason Bonham did not fall far from the tree, that tree, of course, was John Henry Bonham, one of, if not the finest, rock drummer of all time. On top of the performance, the packaging, the video, the audio was all top notch. I'm not sure how anyone can find fault with this.

B008B92U32|1.0|first off kindles dont have cameras so whats the use of having this kind of app. second the screen on a phone really isnt that big so its hard to do right.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|One of the few shows worth owning on DVD to watch over & over.  Haven't gotten to the special features yet, but looking forward to it!  Can't get enough of this show!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|should I buy cause everyone is saying that you only get 2 levels and you have to pay for more
B004QL7K6G|1.0|This dvd was in the 'used-very good' condition category, but it skips the whole movie.  It skips in some of the best parts, too!  Overall, horrible quality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun and I love how it speeds up the longer you run. Just wish there was a coin doubler option like temple run....for free.
0307960471|3.0|It isn't, technically. But the characters are annoying in their self-absorption with their inadequacies, and the plot depends more on their acting like idiots than anything else. And really: seventy years after the War, a relic booby-trapped Nazi mansion in Oslo?<br /><br />Oh well, the ending will satisfy the unhappy reader.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|This is a CD by the  Killers that gets better each time you listen to it. The whole project is solid with 5 or 6 standout songs. Look, they will never top &#34;Hot Fuss&#34;; however, the Killers are an amazing band period.  Can't wait to see them live at the Barclay's Center in NY in May. Get this CD, it's great stuff!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We stopped watching season 3 when it was airing on PBS (Jan--Feb 2013) because we wanted to go back to the beginning. We ordered this and absolutely love it---the price was right, as well. Watch these two seasons BEFORE you get into season 3.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The picture, scene, camera movement and light on this trilogy really are amazing not to mention that batman is the greatest super hero there is. Blue ray discs have such an amazing quality as far as picture and clarity goes. I bought this trilogy used, so not sure if it came with everything but the most important parts which are the movies and the special features cds came intact.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|(See our review of seasons 1&2.) Downton Abbey has it all...great acting, great sets, clothes and camera work. But what's even more important are all the sub-plots running through the different characters. the writing is superb AND believable----you won't get bored---like a page-turner novel, we had to force ourselves to save the next chapter. Downton Abbey is TV drama at its very best.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|So much easier to look up a certain word. Makes homework alot easier!!!! Thanks New Oxford American Dictionary!!!!!! :)only need one word to describe it, awesomeness!
B00B7G23KQ|2.0|the first three where scarier then this on, was very disappointed this movie could have been better dont recommend it at all

B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|that I ended up liking this as much as I did.  I'm not into drugs and do not like movies that put any 'glory' into it--ie good pay, good lifestype (quite frankly IMO if you are involved with illegal drugs in any way,shape or form they should line you up and put a bullet in your skull and that would quickly decrease the blight that it brings to our country and people).  The story lines intertwined well.  John T always surprises me when he plays a shady character.  I would probably rent this again.
0446547573|3.0|I have to first say that this is not my first N.S. book so you would think I would know what I was getting myself in for. For the most part, I did but still this book hit some new lows in my opinion. I am a romantic at heart and I think most of the people who read his books would say the same but.... come on now! Could any single man living in a small town be this perfect without one of the locals getting their hands on him before a woman from the big city just came along and snapped him right up??? I think not! He is just too perect to believe. So when reading this book you are best to be in a dream state of mind. If that is not enough, turn on any Life Time movie of the week and you will find a husband/cop that some poor young girl has married only to find out that he is really the son of the devil. This story has been told so many times I am surprised that it is making it back to the big screen once again.<br /><br />Now for the low blow, and this maybe a spoiler so read on if you wish. What in the WORLD was Nicholas Sparks thinking when he wrote the whole \\"his dead wife was a imaginary friend/ ghost who lived next door to new girlfriend thing???? Talk about needing therapy! That would have sent any sane woman running but this poor girl was so messed up anyway of course she was too much in love to leave. Come on Nick, you can do better then this! Not to judge anyone else but how in the world does this book have so many 5 stars? I gave it 3, did not HATE the book but sure did not LOVE it.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I have admired Meryl Streep for years and I love Tommy Lee Jones.  Together the two were a good match up for this film.  I was rooting for Meryl all the way as she was trying to put some spice back into her marriage yet realizing she may have to make the final decision to move on for herself, if necessary.  Tommy was great as the husband that had lost interest after many years of marriage and was willing to settle on living that way to 'death do us part'.  I was cheering for him when he start to try to make an attempt--wish my husband would surprise me with a nice dinner at a hotel and a room for the night with all the romantic extras--even if it didn't work out the way he had planned.  I loved the ending when they renewed their vows at the beach obviously a different couple than the one that went on the retreat together in the beginning of the movie.
B00404YUG2|5.0|This book was written for every artist who believes they don't have time create. Read Steven Pressfield's book (or even better: listen to the audio version) and overcome your resistance. For more on Pressfield's wonderful book, check out my post at [...]
B006TLFIAQ|4.0|Don't know much about him but I'm beginning to become a fan.  And DeNiro is always great but underused in this film.  Good action packed adventure; the guys are sure to like it.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Boring, predictable and lacking any real depth. Things happened to the characters without any background of why it would happen, at one point I thought there would be a great turn of events and the story would get better, I was wrong. Several spelling/grammar errors and plot flops to boot. Definitely skipping the sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I reccomend this game for all horse back riders and horse lover's like myself. It is truly a great game.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This game keeps my mind working. It's a great game but hurts the eyes a little. I would play it again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is much better than the original. Its has much better graphics. There is more opsticals. There is a cave. GET IT WHILE IT IS FREE!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game - my grand children love playing it because it's easy and they can do it all on their own.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|The Hard Way:  The story line was very credible and easy to follow but it was still intriguing and entertaining.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great Game! One of my very favorites. Keeps my mind active and is a great stress reliever if I have anything to say.
B00992CF6W|5.0|u should buy this game. It is just like the pictures but even better. MOJANG and NOTCH are the best!I have it on my IPad, kindle fire and ipod, but I thinknit should be as updated as the computer
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app - especially for my grand children who always wants to play games on my kindle everytime they come over.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this whole game is so awesome it is unbelievingly awesome. I dodjdjd d x x x x. c f f x x x x
B0063IH60K|2.0|Don't have much to say about this game - not all into slow card games. I guess its ok if you have nothing else to do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Similar to temple run but simpler. My 3yr old loves this game and often beats my mothers score. Point blank this is a simple easy to control game with good graphics that everyone from todlers to grandparents can enjoy. We LOVE IT!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are awesome but some are kind of slow.  I play them with the best of my ability but there are some I can't finish.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a cool game wasn't sure what it was the first time I played it but you get started and then you dont want to stop playing.  It challenges your memory and how fast you can be its a lot of fun.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is really about a lesson in life.  It's how one person can become significant and touch others lives without realizing. I enjoyed this book and its humor while dealing with the inevitable outcome of terminal illness.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wanted something to do but didn't have to play unless I wanted to, this solitaire is that you can change it and make it easy or harder to win but its a lot of fun to play anytime you want.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great,fun way to be a rebel running through the never ending subway tunnels in an addicting free way! Though, the game ends too soon and we,the players, should be given like 3 lives or so. ;)
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Too slow for me but every and a page turner.. I read gone girl and I loved it, but Sharp objects was too slow to the climax for me.. very good very suspenseful book but too slow
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very engaging story. Speaks to a lot of obstacles young people face today. Also fun for flower lovers to imagine
B00992CF6W|5.0|Just kidding its the best game in the world I this game on my moms phone. but she got a new one so I downloaded blockstory nothing like minecraft. then minecraft came out on the kindle fire I ask my dad he was teasing me by press the$6.99 button but no the buy app button then he accedently press buy app. Thanks dad.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The beginning was so hard to get through. It made no sense.  Once the pieces started to come together I could not put this book down.  I would have the mystery of Harriet solved and then bam another twist in the mix.  It kept me on my toes.  Really enjoyed it.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this app is awsome!! the first day i had it i got like 60 songs!!!!! so covienent to be able to download songs and be able to listen to them anytime without have to pay ridiculous prices. great app!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games made ever and its better than temple run and temple run 2 it requires a lot of concentration and hand eye coridnation
B00364K6YW|5.0|While I thoroughly enjoy the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice, both for excellent acting and the beautiful camera work, this version with Colin Firth is my favorite because it has both excellent acting and because it is truer to the details of the work (having the equivalent of multiple movies' worth of time helps with that!)<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is a classic, and this extended version makes it possible to share so many of the nuances of the work - and does it beautifully.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I  don't understand why i found this book so interesting. But i couldn't put it down.  Well written and I want more
0316789720|5.0|Bought this for my 11 year old. She is very happy with this book and has learned many neat tricks. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their drawing.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Good read. The author has a way of keeping you in suspense. You can't wait to keep turning the pages.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Everyone with kids (or without) should at least see the Lion King. It's a classic and both my kids love it. I'm glad I own it and can put it on whenever.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Didn't really believe the characters. No substance and too predictable. This could have had humour as 2characters find themselves married and learn to live with each other.
B0072OFOM6|3.0|Eh. The first season was great. The second was &#34;different&#34; and this one was well, blah. I don't love it or hate it but I probably wouldn't buy it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book for romantics.............in other words, most men, like me, will not like it.  Really a book for the ladies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|enjoyed reading..easy reading kept interest and wanting to continue reading<br />enjoyed reading..easy reading kept interest and wanting to continue reading
0375703764|1.0|As an avid reader that loved the Blair Witch Project, I was really looking forward to this book and waited several weeks to get it at the local library.  I was horrified, yes.  Horrified by how boring this book was.  Absolutely no atmosphere at all.  If I could do it again, I would've rather been at work than reading this novel.  What a waste of time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the app,  but I can't get it to open most of the time.  I even removed and downloaded a second time.  Same issue.
0316098515|5.0|Chef Daniel Humm owner of Eleven Madison Park and The Nomad in New York City has produced a wonderful cookbook. Very user friendly for those of us who aren't 3 Michelin star chefs. I've eaten at EMP. It was fantastic. What is exciting is the fact that chef Humm has mixed it up again. These recipes are no longer served there. You need to go back to see what all the excitement is about!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game subway surfers is the best experience. I am so lucky to have this game.  I love subway surfers.Subway Surfers.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is one of the best websites for women interested in food, crafts, ideas, etc.  I have forwarded to friends who also feel the same way.  Thanks to whoever came up with this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game can be fun to play for hours of fun. Anybody kids, teenagers, and adults can play this game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show! Drama, humor, and old world English charm. Awesomely quick instant download to Amazon Instant Video too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is my favorite thing to play I'm addicted to this game best game ever you should get it
B00003CXA2|5.0|If you love this movie, you'll love all the extras. Great quality and worth the buy! A classic movie you enjoy every single time you watch it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Kind of<br />Informative but interesting I kind of liked it for how much information it had<br />It was cool that I could read<br />I should put some pics . On it too<br />Thanks for having this dictionary here it is very useful
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Easy and fast to download and view in Amazon Instant Video. Can be watched on my Mac, iPad, or iPhone. Good stuff! Another great season of an awesome show.
038572179X|4.0|This book arrived on time and was very well packaged. It was in good condition for the most part. There was no writing inside or torn pages. There was some slight sun damage to the first chapter or two and around the pages rim, but it does not seem to take away from the book's condition too much. The book was only .94, so it appears to be a good deal.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Disney/Pixar generally produces movies well worth watching.  This one was a bit out there but had the usual morals ending. It was good and a happy ending.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I reaaly enjoy this game.  The pictures are very nice. I love the artwork. It starts easy and gradually gets harder.  I highly recomend it to anyone who likes puzzles and is looking for something differnt.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If it's possible to be even more fun and addicting than Temple Run, Temple Run 2 makes it so. Brilliant graphics, new abilities, and interchangeable characters. The new Temple Run is one of the best games I've played on my kindle fire - and it's free!
B008WCP2PG|2.0|When I ordered this dvd I MADE SURE IT LISTED EXTENDED DANCES in the description.  I gave it as a present BECAUSE of that feature.  I only recently found out that it does not include the long version of the dance routines.  The product features has been updated to the \\"correct\\" info, but I am very, very disappointed because I searched ALL the ordering options.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the game was cool fun and very easy. The only time I need to take a break is when I need to go to school.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Cut the rope &amp;Pudding monsters are very very fun. I say Zeptolab is a very good company, so keep making fantastic games!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have enjoyed this game very much. I don&quot;t usually play games very often, but I hate putting this one down.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|bought it as a gift for my godchildren.  $8.00 for the season....what a deal.  Thanks to black monday.  Who knew
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun! With the different updates, you have different sceneries, so it's not the same boring place. You can change your character and even your hoveboard. There are also many different boosts.  It's.  Really fun and addicting game. I love it!
B002Q63JEU|5.0|This album has simple words with great strong instrumentation of a nice simplicity. Love the rhythms and beats and words.

B00992CF6W|4.0|if you have a kindle fire and are looking for this to be updated alot think again. they stopped making updates after 0.5.0 when there is a 0.6.0. the androids have to play on older versions please fix it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game...its funny and very diffrent from other games.I can totally reccomend this game for other customers buying this game.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I liked this book and the series, but the ending made me mad. They didn't say if Grace lived or not and I want to know. But over all really good series
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. It has many different types of places that you travel such as New York and Rio. Great buy for a greater game.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I heard someone mention the show as I was watching some sort of news program and thought I would check it out.  I've been buying the episodes one by one and wish I would have paid for the  whole series right up front. Definitely 5 stars
0345803507|5.0|Had to get the whole series..once you read one book you want to continue to read the others. so I got the whole series ..great delivery time too.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|but still had a number of visual highlights and Hellboy is one my personal favorite characters to make it from the book to the screen.
0345803493|5.0|the book was just as described and I couldn't put it down..finished reading it so very quickly ..couldn't believe it ..
B005OCFHHK|5.0|A note to anyone having trouble with playback on their Blu Ray players - I could not get the 8th film in the series to play. All the others played flawlessly. I went the DVDs back and received a prompt replacement. Same problem with the same disc. Found out I had to periodically update my Blu Ray player's Firmware online. After I did that it worked perfectly. Really a very nice collection for the money.
0547884591|1.0|I would never buy anything of his again--there was no reason to have the language in this book except to look cool and with it I assume--so juvenile!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|and with a cast this big I would have thought the studios would have marketed this movie better. I loved the style .. kinda like Sin City but not as graphic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a really fun game i think im addicted to it. i recomend this game to anyone. everyone i know plays this game.
B0009P42S2|4.0|.... and one of the better Steam Punk movies out there. Great visuals and sound and I don't usually like to play the dubbed soundtrack but it was well done.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have trouble going to sleep so found this app and love it.  The best part is I can create my own sounds to help lull into dreamland.  Highly recommend this to other troubled sleepers.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|Wow. The cast is perfect as well as the makeup. The storyline is fun and easy to follow for those unfamiliar with the books. One of my all time favs.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I watch and admire movies made by Almodovar, David Lynch, Aronofsky, Solondz, Charlie Kaufman and alot of Soderbergh stuff, so Im not opposed to the symbolic or far-out. When the character is monotone and cryptic, he doesnt have to be boring, but he is here because he's MEANINGLESS. He's meaningless when nothing he says connects to our deeper understanding of his humanity - perhaps being reflected from some dark caverns of emotional connectivity. There are utterances that have no connective tissue within consensually validated meanings. In short, we have words that make no sense, or which make  non-sense.<br /><br />Many lines are spoken without the viewer believing the actor has any concept of who this character is; who he was or why he was saying these things. He repeats lines from memory. Its like \\"we've smoked a joint; now anything we utter is cool. I am David Cronenberg, and everything I poop is gold; the chemical aids I ingest help me know it's so.\\"<br /><br />FINALLY, Paul Giamatti arrives with a brilliant performance at the end.  The writer's  'almost-there' understanding of the schizoid life of intellectual \\"knowing\\" versus \\"really feeling\\" as-the-same-thing is great stuff concerning the workings of the \\"Mirage\\"; and it is rare to shine light into this dark world.<br /><br />Giamatti takes this bunch to school; - the ENTIRE FILM becomes dramatic, taut, fascinating.... altho the acting of both the wife (Sarah Gadon) and the bodyguard (Kevin Durand) was also very good. The movie could have gotten real legs had they accelerated the wife into being Patinsons gadfly, a more than able intellect, not-intimidated by his wealth and power; but that task was probably as intimidating to Cronenberg as it was to his creation of character-Patinson. This appears a drug-induced script, that no-doubt looked great in the wee hours of morning's spinning mentalities, but now lives as just another delusion; boring and unimpressive in the light of day.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|You will lose yourself in this story.  Heart warming and breaking at the same time.  A fast read that will stay with you.  Well written, great characters and a story that will leave you thinking, &#34;what would I do?&#34;
B00A3XWB10|4.0|I have just received this by mail. My name is even on the back cover since I was an early contributor. I have every CD they have released, and I was hoping for a production similar to \\"Generation Wild\\". Boy, was I wrong... The music is awesome. Simon even sounds like Dave at times. But the production sucks big time. It is all muddy, and it seems a kid was behind the board instead of an experienced producer. A shame. The whole production ruined an otherwise great CD.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This movie was truly awful. It's only saved from being the worst Aliens movie ever by Aliens Resurrection which is 90 minutes of your life you can never get back. But jesus, this is really the best Scott can do? I felt embarrassed for him. The plot was ludicrously bad and the fact that it was beautifully rendered only makes me sad that so much money and beautiful effects were wasted on such a tired recycle of sci-fi cliches. There's really nothing new here and even the recycling is poorly done given that it is meant seriously not as humor or irony. Prometheus is pretty much exactly what the original Alien movie would have been if it had totally sucked rather then being awesome. If you're really dying for good sci-fi watch Alien again or go read a book. Prometheus really isn't worth your time or money.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|man cuz dis game be made fo lil 6 ye ol homesexuls who lik gay stuf so I loved it
B006B9XZ1K|5.0|Wikipedia says, \\"Speak Now is the third studio album by American singer–songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 25, 2010, by Big Machine Records. Production for the album took place during 2008 to 2010 at several recording studios, and was handled by Swift and country music producer Nathan Chapman. Written entirely by Swift as the follow-up to Fearless (2008), Speak Now expands on the country pop style of her previous work, and features lyrical themes concerning love, romance and heartbreak.\\"  [...]    For me, the key phrase is \\"Written entirely by Swift ... \\" There are no co-writes for any of these songs. Taylor is a world class songwriter, and this album is all hers. I can't recommend this enough.  If you love Taylor like we members of Taylor Nation do, you need to add this to your collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game please play it very addicting!!! Its like a better version of temple run. Its very easy to get good at.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Unlimited customizing makes this app a gem. Up to like ten different sounds can be played simultaneously to produce vivid life like backdrops. We use it every night.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|I've seen this movie 100 times at least.  BLU RAY COMES OUT IN THE FALL OF 2013!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!!  FLOUNDER IS SO CUTE!!!!!!

B0063GORYU|5.0|This version of Spider is fun.  It is easy and entertaining - something you can do just to pass some  -time without thinking too hard.  You can &quot;undo&quot; if you want to - which is good if you cbange your mind or don't like losing.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|These are very pretty, easy to put on and my daughter LOVES them! Definitely would buy again for only $9 bucks:)
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My boys LOVE all the Dr Panda apps! They are great- entertaining and educational!!  They are 2 and 3 years old and this app is great for their age group.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun to play on the kindle.  Easy to do but constantly asked/ told to purchase if you want to get very fast in the game or play for longer than 15 min  as your energy gets used up quickly.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I purchased three versions of this for my grandchildren ages 12, 9 and 7.  They all exclaimed it was the best Christmas present!  And the games are difficult and the boys are very competitive so the games got passed around and enjoyed by all including the parents.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|so i open the app for the first time, and have to wait 5 min for it to load. then it brings me to a horse and says.<br />&quot;if this horse likes you, you can name it.&quot; i kept rubbing the horse and feeding it carrots, and eventuly the farm hand guy said<br />&quot; ok, lets start taking care of beauty&quot;<br /><br />it didnt let me name the horse!<br /><br />not only that, but sometimes i will click on something and then the entire screen goes black, and i have to press the backarrow like 5 timea to make it go away. i was not pleased by this.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My wife and I loved the series. Had missed it last year and are now all caught up. Enjoying the new season now.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Am enjoying The Weather Channel very much as I have kins that live in several areas of the U.S.A. and I just put them intheir locations and it takes you right there.So highly recommend this SITE.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband who loves old war movies. We watch it often and never get tired of the story. Highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great! I love all of the features it offers to make it your own. I definately recommend this game to casual gamers as it is a go at your own pace game.
B00005JLEX|5.0|If you are a Seinfeld fan then I highly recommend purchasing this product. It will bring you much laughter over and over again without getting old. Great humorous show about nothing.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Its a very good game, but the closest I've came to winning, is killing half the world population, I find it very hard to actually kill the entire world
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it its fun and I like horses its quite fun and would recommend it to you out there
B007THA4FI|3.0|Lots of characters, all unhappy. Hard to put down once you get all the characters straight.<br />A sad and dark book.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have not had any problems with it on the Kindle Fire.  It works fine.  I just don't think that it provides me with much useful information.  I can figure similar info out for myself pretty easily.
B00ANY94A0|3.0|Save your money. The only reason this even gets 3 stars is because my daughter thought it was the cutest thing.  It's so tiny, comes in a plastic bag (not your regular Lego box) and my daughter put it together in 1 minute.  I would pay $3-4 but not $9.
1575666286|4.0|This book tells it like it is, a book serious about health for all, if you have cancer or are at high risk of cancer, even if you are serious about health this book is for you, some parts of it are easy to follow but some parts are a little harder to do, its worth checking out for a better, healther way of life.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Overall fantastic story and extremely well written. It made my heart happy to read. I highly recommend this book and will read more books by this author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am a mom of five children and this game is my sanctuary...it's takes my mind off of the chaos around me.  I would recommend this game to any and everyone as a way to relieve stress...keep making new themes...I love waiting to see the next theme and unlocking goodies!!!!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Cool and sweet I love this game and . It is dope every body should play this it's better than temple run
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has really been awesome. It would be awesome if we could go forks Washington dc and it would have all the twilight character's. It would be more awesome if it would have the wolf character's too. (Please make a free twilight saga game for me and my best friend because we can't find one)
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Very well translated and as engrossing in the written word as it is onstage and scree , if not more so.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just finished reading this for the second time.  I loved every minute the first time, and the second did not disappoint.  After seeing the moving, which was ok but left out some needed information, I read this picturing the actors.  That made it really come to life.  I strongly recommend you read it more than once.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book must read! Great love story, you will laugh and cry all at the same time. Just hope the movie is as good.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Works as described in the product description. Nothing much to add except it has held up well for me personally! Great addition to my iPad 2!
B00012QM8G|5.0|I cant believe I havent seen this movie before. But I hadnt. It was so amazing, and Liam Neeson is excellent. I think this is one of the best movies of all time. I grew up in the 50's and cant believe we were not taught anything about this or even the riots in Mississippi, and Martin Luther King. I went to a high class white school and they completely ignored these topics. What a tragedy. I cant remember anything they taught us about what was going on in the world. So sad and incomprehencible that kind of horror went on in the world. At least Schlinder saved over 1000 jews. This film should be shown in schools today and teach our kids what happened. We should remember them! God Bless.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The title says it all its fast past action,  parkor elements and best of all :COINS!!!! So what r u waiting for,  go and get the game right now.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I liked the story about Pi and his unbelieveable survival at sea with a tigar.  I would recommend this book to the general public of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and fun! Its like owning a horse of your own! We are addicted and cant put the game down!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is so much fun funnest game I every played! I play this game every day. again so much fun!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have read this book 4 times and find something I missed on the other reads.  This book is definitely intriguing.
B003EVFHYG|4.0|This is a great soundtrack. I had heard some of Powell's work before, and had been less than impressed (e.g. the original Bourne trilogy). But this soundtrack soared beyond my expectations of Powell. A fantastic and emotional soundtrack. I fell like I'm living the movie when I listen to it.
B006X415GK|5.0|The product was exactly what I was looking for. She looks great in my collection. I would be slightly concerned about how it was packaged and shipped. I had no problems whatsoever and the box was in great condition. I would only be concerned if you we're buying for a collection.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|This is a nice soundtrack. The voice casting is excellent. But it doesn't quite live up to its predecessors' legacy. Anne Hathaway, Samantha Barks, and Eddie Redmayne are fantastic. Russel Crowe and Amanda Seyfried are OK. Not great, but could have been a lot worse. The biggest problem I have is Hugh Jackman. So many emotions flow through Valjean throughout the course of the story. As such, Valjean should be an impassioned character, such as Colm Wilkinson's portayal in the original &#34;Les Mis&#34;. Jackman doesn't have the spirit or fire of Valjean for my tastes. Overall, a very adequate soundtrack.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie was all I hoped it would be. Karl Urban was an excellent choice for Dredd. I really hope they make a sequel!
B006FYHTFO|4.0|A nice soundtrack. Zimmer is by far my favorite soundtrack composer. The way he accurately portrays the characters through his music astounds me. However, the second doesn't quite capture the flair and quirkiness of the original Holmes soundtrack. Still good, just not on the same level.
B0015DROBO|5.0|After seeing the movie, the book is even more intriguing.  Initially, I had trouble staying with it. But, then I could not put it down.  Anxious to try the next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book is so good. it took my breath away. the story is so real and i cant stop reading it since i started. a must read!!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|wish I could be able to get neighbors and friends to help with hearts and chests. Other then that my kids and I enjoy playing
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game. The tasks are good, but training can get a little tedious. Other than that, Great game
B007M84PD6|5.0|Got this as a gift. Now I don't know if I can wait for my sister's birthday to pass it on! It isn't translated into 27 different languages for nothing. Marina Lewycka has a great appreciation for the ridiculousness in human nature. Yet compassionate, too. The title is just a teaser. No more hints. Grab this for a delightful read. Not at all mushy - just funny. Has a strong ring of truth, despite being fiction. Very good choice for someone who might be ill or is feeling down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't stop playing and the features are amazing you can really tell this is a sequel to the first temple run
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Many of my friends have tried to get me to check this show out. I finally did and I am so glad I finally listened.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game,it's very addictive. I'm learning New stuff every day! It gives you something to do. I always have a game to play.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was hesitant to read Sparks, but I really enjoyed this book! It was a quick read and has a great ending. Its a mix of romance and suspense.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is so awsome  and adicting i play it all the time. It is like templerun but funner. I recomend this game to anyone even little kids can play it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was great.  We get Percy back but we have the Romans too.  Great new ideas.  Fast read.  If you liked the origional Percy series, you'll like this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and they make it so you can play with your Facebook friends,,. Itz awesome an  very easy too play
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Sure it's a little derivative of the first Percy Jackson series, here we meet Roman demi-gods and whatnot.  It's a pretty good read, I enjoyed it while traveling.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is one of my best games yet it has epic rope slowly slings i love the new guys it is dfently made it to the top and i wont you to have some fun with me
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun!It gets challenging as it speeds up but, it just makes you want to play more and since they make updates to it, it makes the game even more addictive than it already is.I would say this game is fun for several ages. Finally I would say that the game just brings joy when you have free time and looking for a challenge.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is quite addicting and easy to use. It's a great time killer. Okay, so that's the 'Ups'. The 'Downs' are that coins are very difficult to earn and you can only get peanuts with real money. Altogether, it's a very fun app.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I started watching this show after I saw it beat all of my other favorites (Breaking Bad, Downton Abbey) at the Golden Globes. I can see why it won now. Seriously, the best show ever! Impeccably written, the acting is brilliant, and the plot just sucks you in! I don't even like politics or shows about war, but I absolutely love this show, and that says something.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was definitely the greatest book I have EVER read in my life. It honestly did Truly change me for the best. Adam`s and everyone else's story has made me see and think differently. I feel it has even bettered my relationship with Jesus. Thank you Adam and all the SEAL community.
B000002U8G|5.0|what can i say about this record that hasn't been said before? it takes you a dreamy state that goes on and on, the musicianship on this album is masterful in my opinion, these guys are in a different class, really brilliant.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lol I love this game I play it everyday it is so interesting u get coins and by New ppl and skate boards
B006G7R25W|5.0|Ice Station Zebra is a film made on the exciting novel written by Alistair MacLean. It covers the cold war period of the late nineteen sixties. The story is about a spy satellite orbiting in the atmosphere and then parachuting to a place in the Arctic near Greenland. This is observed both by Russia and the United States of America. A figure in a hood struggles through the ice storm and retrieves the capsule. He is not aware that he is being watched by another person who is hidden nearby. Soon,  the world hears that Drift Ice Station Z has met with a disaster as a weather station at the North Pole.<br />Nuclear submarine, Tigerfish, commanded by James Ferraday (Rock Hudson) is sent from Scotland to be tried out as a rescue mission. He is asked to take a band of marines and a mysterious British passenger called David Jones (Patrick McGoohan) along with a Russian defector, Boris Vaslov (Ernest Borgnine).<br />This tale is about how the submarine manages to break through the ice caps at Drift Ice Station Z (Zebra)(Previously the expansion codes for the letter Z were Zebra as they are Zulu today). There are several mishaps. There is sabotage involved.<br />Once they manage to break through the ice caps, they find the weather station in a wrecked state with very few survivors. Jones is looking for the capsule. There is a twist in store for the viewers here as to who is looking for what and whom. The Russian defector Vaslov plays an important part. The climax is quite exciting with Russian and American warplanes joining the party at Zebra. Captain Ferraday saves the day with his quick thinking. They are all after the capsule as it contains photographs of the locations of American missile bases that are taken from a British satellite that is stolen by the Russians.<br />The film has been directed by John Sturges and it was released in October 1968 using the 70mm Panorama Lens and six-track stereophonic sound effects. The background music score is excellent by Michel LeGrand.<br />This is good movie experience as the cinematography and the exciting musical score draw you into the film. The story moves at a decent pace with intelligent dialogues keeping you well engrossed..<br />This is good movie experience as the cinematography and the exciting musical score draw you into the film.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome, a little laggy but awesome. The idea of it is also great and I never get bored because there is always something to look forward to.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze Runner is very suspenseful but also very simple. The plot line is not very complex so it is easy read. It is perfect for light, fun reading that keeps you intrigued and coming back for more. Or perfect for middle school/high school readers. As a middle school teacher, I would recommend this book to my students.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a lot better than the original Temple Run. I like the resurrection gems a lot. It's a lot more challenging than the original. I don't like the setup of the powerup menu, though. It's kind of confusing. I really like all the obstacles like the water and the mining tracks. It's fun and challenging. :)
B0011Z32PS|5.0|I promised a dear friend of mine (who died tragically from his injuries from a motorcycle accident 17 years ago) that I would add this CD to my collection after turning down his only copy. Finally, I have done so!!! R I P my friend, You are gone but never, Ever forgotten!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved, loved the book! Bit of a different ending but kept it fresh. And the shades of Christian at the end was interesting. I recommend this book to just about everyone I know! Love the work of E L James!!<br />5 stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great addicting game in which you (Jake) get to go on a action packed hart pounding adventure.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great way to meet horse people and is fun taking care of your own horses. This game is really awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If u are looking for a new game I recommend this game it's free,fun,and challenging me and my friends love to challenge who can go the fastest or who has the best score.also u don't have to do a thing to update it because it updates it self. HAVE FUN PLAYING!!!!!
B001GJ9GG8|3.0|Connery co-produced this late career art thief potboiler. Zeta-Jones is lovely to look at and she uses her dancing skills well, but the plot is predictable, including the twists at the end.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|This release of MIB attempts to develop some human interaction between the two protagonists.  However, it's clumsily done and simply not interesting.  The attraction of the first two releases was the strange and funny antics of the various aliens, of which there are very few in this release.<br /><br />Glad I didn't pay for this in a theater.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first time I've written any sort of review.  I really had a hard time putting this down and found myself wondering during the day at work where the story would go next!  I will anxiously await the arrival of future Wool books.  Thanks for the excellent read.
B009X00E18|5.0|A perfect case.  It protects my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and yet maintains the integrity of the Fire's compact size.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I appreciate the author very much for sharing his experience.  I highly recommend reading it.  It has held my attention so far.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Christian Bale is perfect casting call for Batman.  Good storyline. I'm just filling in the required amount of words here.
0393345084|5.0|End This Depression by Dr. Paul Krugman is an engaging book about the origin of the Great Recession, the present slow growth scenario and a prediction of normalized job growth near the end of this decade.<br /><br />Dr. Krugman is correct about a number of things. First, demand is sluggish. Unemployment is still too high as evidenced by the 1 million people who applied for 50,000 new jobs at Mc Donald's in April 2011. Unemployment amongst the young and recent college graduates is still unacceptably high. The debt of the United States is excessive although it must be judged in relation to the huge size of the economy.<br /><br />Dr. Krugman believes that the stimulus is still not large enough to do the job of bringing the economy back to full employment. Back in 2008, Warren Buffet pointed to the upcoming year as the period for clearing out surplus housing inventories so that new construction can begin in earnest.<br /><br />Despite all of the misery at the lower rung of the economic ladder, Dr. Krugman shows how  the top 1% managed to increase their incomes by a factor of 5 over the previous 50 years. There is heavy criticism in the book of Wall Street excesses which lead to the crash. These excesses can be addressed by requiring margins for derivatives and amending the Uniform Commercial Code to set forth the rights, duties, obligations and recourse of the counterparties to derivative transactions.<br /><br />A strength of the book is that the author quite correctly pinpoints the things which lead to the current slow growth scenario. The presentation could be supplemented in other areas. For instance, more government stimulus could be provided to small business. In addition, more revenues could be raised with excess consumption taxes on things like junk food which cause medical expenses to balloon in programs like Medicaid.<br /><br />The top 1% should pay more taxes on excess consumption. The United States consumes a disproportionate amount of the world's resources and this imbalance needs to be redirected to achieve economic growth through goods and services that are truly needed.<br /><br />Although fewer people can afford newer cars and homes, things can be done to change this inequity. For instance micro-cooperatives are blossoming in areas of NYC. These apartments are approximately 250-350 square feet, as opposed to a 500 or more square foot apartment. The miniaturization provides better affordability to wage earners because these living quarters are a fraction of the cost of a traditional apartment.<br /><br />In addition, the government could put more resources into Section 8 housing instead of encouraging poor people to buy their own homes. Miniaturization could come to auto manufacture by allowing smaller cars to be built like the Tata Motors autos priced at a fraction of the cost of a standard size car. Zoning could be relaxed to allow more manufactured housing to be built-particularly near the coastlines.<br /><br />Part of the unemployment problem will resolve itself with a wave of baby boomer retirees paving the way for millions of new college graduates and others to be hired. In addition, the government at every level should rebuild infrastructure throughout the United States because the future population in America will be close to a half billion people. This country cannot support such a growing population on the current infrastructure of the '60s.<br /><br />End This Depression by Dr. Paul Krugman is a call to action to ameliorate longstanding negations in how our economy operates. People need to cut out wasteful consumption, save more and upgrade skills in preparation for the wave of retirements coming, as well as the need to repair the infrastructure for the next half century and beyond.<br /><br />Credits: First Published on Blogcriticss and this imbalance needs to be redirected to achieve economic growth through goods and services that are truly needed.<br /><br />Although fewer people can afford newer cars and homes, things can be done to change this inequity.

B004SYP5WC|4.0|In my new financial state I needed to see everything that was going out monthly so I could make necessary changes and cuts where needed. This app was beneficial in helping me do just that.<br />I can see the total due to go out each month, and depending on the income, make arrangements, or get the bills paid On Time.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|Not sure why this book received so much acclaim.  I don't think of myself as a cynic, I just don't like being pandered to.  It was enjoyable at first, but as we progress through the book, I tired of his fantastical escapades as a young man - just got a bit...eh?  The present day part of the book was a bit more engaging and I don't mind a good, happy ending, but overall I wish I'd borrowed it from the library and hadn't spent money on it.  It's the kind of book I wouldn't mind reading if I needed to have a good sit in the &#34;thrown room.&#34;
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This was one of the quirkiest movies I've ever seen.  Well acted, beautifully shot and sweet story. I recommend it. You'll Enjoy!
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Lots of action. Too much action. Not enough smart dialogue and interesting plotting. However, I've wasted two hours in worse ways...
0380730405|5.0|This book is a true gem. But I warn you, you need a brain to enjoy it. Not just any brain will do. You must be able to transport yourself to another time, to enjoy richly woven suspenseful tales which make you feel as though you are in the same room indulging your sense of smell in the heady bouquets of roses, bluebells, hydrangeas, and rodedendrons. You must be able to feel as a young, naive, unworldly,  penniless  girl in the twenties would feel. A girl with no family and no experience with the world. You must believe things were different in that time. I am firmly convinced the one star reviewers lack such a brain. This would explain their ignorance. Oh and those one star reviews because the page was torn or the print too small. Hmmm do you review such things? Save that for e-mail correspondence with the seller or Amazon. That is the proper channel for those - just throws off the curve wouldn't you say? Pick up this book and be prepared to be transported. To those of you who've trashed it with a one star review .... Shame on you. Just because you lack the intelligence to enjoy the gift you were given, don't spoil it for those with a literary brain who would treasure the the fabulous book that is......Rebecca.<br /><br />UPDATE: I admit my review was a little snarky. I won't change it because there were other reviews that bashed my review and to change my review would make theirs seem strange.....My apologies, I'm very sorry! I was really aiming my review at some of the 1 star reviews which were written by (it seems) people who trashed it only because they could not see the heroine acting in such a way. As I said it was written in and about a different time and about a girl who was taught to be subservient and not to think for herself. As one of my favorite authors once said.... the reader must be willing to suspend disbelief for a moment or two and the author must congratulate that with a tale worth telling! That being said I apologize for my snarkiness. I must have been in a mood that day! LOl Ah well it made for some great conversations!!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I really like this game but with the black background & such bright colore on the blocks I get a bad head headake after playing a few games.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|Hard to get into due to unfamiliar words. Adjusted as I read more. I did enjoy it very much. A book worth reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it! The best game ever and it is awesome.you should.add more limited time specials and make.it easier to get jackpots.
B00B9366VO|4.0|The movie was great but all music sounded like poop! The streaming sound quality of this film was soooo bad, and it's about music! It would have been so much more enjoyable if the sound was good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is amazingly awesome.this game is cool becouse the nature.I realty think you should down load it.<br />cool.....
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I think this game is another excellent success wonderful story line and graphics great puzzles, mini games and hidden object scenes I recommend playing can't wait for next adventure to come out.
1402793375|5.0|Even if you make all your power points and lessons online, this will give you an excellent, targeted history of which photographs and documents to use to teach the heartbreak, attrition, collateral damage, and oppression of the ironically named Manifest Destiny.  You can find the documents and images here, and fall in love with them here, and then go to your search engine for placement in your power points and handouts.  It saves so much time!<br /><br />I also bought this for my stepdad who is an encyclopedia of history on his own.  I was worried to give it to him because he already has Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (as well as every other historical text  there is), and he almost cried!  It was his favorite gift.  He sat on the couch and pored through this book for quite awhile.  It was definitely a warm and fuzzy moment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Glad to be able to catch up on program I missed.  Watched first 2 seasons via my Prime account.  Was willing to pay small amount for this broadcast.  Now I can join my friends who talk frequently about this series.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm a teacher who hardly ever uses films.  I'm very choosy about what I use, whether it's a document, a piece of literature, or a political cartoon.  When it comes time to teach/reteach plot line and the elements of the short story, in both my honors and regular classes, I use this film.  Why is this the perfect film for both boys and girls?  For both Honors and regular classes?<br /><br />1.  The Whedons have instant credibility, especially now that The Avengers was so successful with a wide audience (Joss wrote its screenplay, as well as the one for Toy Story).  Students also recognize the cast from shows like Castle, The Big Bang Theory, and How I Met Your Mother, so they're in it.<br />2.  Omniscient point of view:  Musicals are the perfect genre to teach this point of view.  It also reinforces the truth that film is a form of literature.  Students become aware that a film can be in the first person if there is a voice-over in the first person.  Otherwise, it is third person.  Kurosawa is a great filmmaker for showing more than one character's interpretations of an event, but this uses popular culture icons and the timeless superhero motif to make a musical cool!  It also shows that omniscient doesn't necessarily mean you know EVERY character's thoughts--just the important ones to the conflict.<br />3.  There are both major and minor conflicts that are easy to identify.  There are three clear conflicts, all three of which Dr. Horrible exposes in the first scene.  Every student benefits from this complex structure AND understands it.  It's not beneath the honors students, and the students in the regular class can follow it and identify it, as well.  They can also see how climax in a plot line can be in the same scene for every conflict, but different parts.  Best line with a double meaning to discuss that addresses two of the conflicts in one:  \\"The world I wanted at my feet\\".  GENIUS!<br />4.  Resolution symbolism.  At first, when the film goes dark, students call out, \\"It's over?  What?\\"  Then we have an amazing discussion where it comes out that the simplicity of the ending really exposes Billy's darkness and loneliness and how utterly human and broken and incomplete he is when he's alone.<br />5.  You can understand every single word in the lyrics.  The enunciation is perfect.<br />6.  There's love and superheroes.  How perfect is that?<br />7.  Every song is catchy, and the dialogue is witty.  During class, students react the whole way through.  Some of my students are still singing the songs.  They have also come back to me and told me they've watched it several times since class.  They talk to others about it.  Even after they're my students, they come back to visit me, ask me what we're doing, and ask, \\"Have you shown them Dr. Horrible yet?\\"  It's a hit!<br />8.  It catches you off guard.  You think it's gonna be funny, and then you're hit with a curve ball.<br />9.  The end of each act is a perfect discussion place, if you feel like your class needs to discuss and clarify complications.<br />10.  This has elements of a Greek tragedy, not only because of the three acts, but with our flawed hero whose own ambition is destroying him.<br />11.  Themes involve the darkness and frivolity of society, false prophets, what a hero truly is.  Powerful depth for a film that seems to be a comedy.<br />12.  It's short, only 42 minutes long, and yet so much happens.  These men are geniuses!  Thank goodness for that writer's strike where they just got bored sitting around and decided to come up with this gem!<br /><br />WARNINGS:<br />1.  There are two sexual references, one involving the word \\"penis\\".  Students can handle this.  Don't prepare them for it or make a big deal out of it if students giggle.  It's funny.  It even goes to show the shallowness of Dr. Horrible's nemesis, Captain Hammer, and how he hides his true self from everyone by Billy who is in awe at their blindness--the references are not just there because sex sells.  They have a purpose.<br />2.  If you don't talk to them about what musicals can do as literary genres and point of view, many students will act too macho whenever a character begins to sing.  They will guffaw, turn away, or in some other way act like it's silly.  Just tell them that they are mature, young adults and that you have a Plan B if they can't handle this.  Then after you show them the movie, tell them what you saw that you liked about how they were audience members.<br /><br />I feel like I can guarantee success with this one.  Let's just say that it would be hard to fail.  Your students will love it, and you will never be accused of trying to get out of teaching for awhile by merely showing a film to your class.
1439102813|5.0|This book was chosen by one (1) of my book-club members as our January reading selection, and I must say that though I had this book in my pile of books to read, I am sooo grateful that I was pushed to read it now. This is a very touching,informative,  easy, and thought provoking read. The journey of the main character has you cheering her on with her accomplishments as well as her challenges. The family dynamics are sooo real!! I highly recommend this book.
8866131350|4.0|This one is much thicker and heavier than the 12-month one that my husband asked for.  In fact, he bought a 12-month one after I gave him this one.  No matter what, though, Moleskine is the best pocket-sized planner on the market.  The pages never fall out; the cover is soft, yet durable, and doesn't shed any coating; there's a page marker that is connected to the planner; and the elastic closure stretches nicely and doesn't break, no matter how many business cards and receipts end up in the planner.
B009YQJ322|1.0|Worst movie I ever seen. I would not reccomend it to anyone. Do not waste your money buying it at any price.
0451418441|5.0|How often have you selected an novel and could not put it down? Well, you may just find this in \\"World Without End\\". Ken Follett once again has struck gold. I have read all of Follett's books and I rate this one near the top. During the 14th century it was not the time for women to voice their opinions in public. This is a love story of broken hearts and dreams. Men ruled the world, at least in old England. Read about how men took advantage of women no matter what age they may be. How monks worked together to get what they wanted for themselves from the earl's and village people. Caris, a bright and challenging women who would not let men take advantage and set out in her own way to help the neglected and ill. Merthin, the builder who could build just about anything during this time. His brother, Ralph, who was ruthless in is quest to become and earl and would kill at the drop of your hat. Gwenda who was taught by her father to steal at the age of ten and then when she became a teenage he sold her to common outlaws. How Gwenda excaped by murdering two of her captives. The twist and turns of those in Kingsbridge that wanted all and gave little. The black plaque that invaded most of Europe and how Caris fought this deadly illness. Once you begin reading this book, you'll not want to put it down. Page after page of intrgue will keep you in suspence. DP
1595825045|5.0|The series is one of the most imaginative, well written ever created.  On ever page of this book you will find insights into the creators' processes regarding the characters, story, and working with the studios that financed and drew the show.  You get a sense of how brilliant these guys were and how much fun they had.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is hands down the best book on health and nutrition I have ever read! I will recommend this book to all my friends and family.
B0086700CM|5.0|Everyone from my wife to my 10 year old son to my 7 year old daughter love the game.  Easy game play and quick and fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun I like it a lot. I think it is the mort fun game I every played.............lol
B0089XWU6W|4.0|This is an amazing 2-part documentary on Woody Allen, from early career to his modern movies, but Amazon lists this import Blu-ray as \\"Region B2\\" which states: \\"Region B/2: Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand\\". I don't think it will play in American Blu-ray players. Instead, buy the cheaper DVD or stream it from Amazon Prime Instant Video, it's well worth it.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I have read all 3 in this trilogy and every one is great.  I only wished that it could have kept going
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My kids and I love playing with my parents who live far away from us. It keeps us closer together!
B007EECSFA|3.0|I have now read 3 of Kate Morton's books and unfortunately for first 2 are her best.  I tried with the 3rd book but just couldn't get past the 4th chapter.  This book is okay but certainly not up to par with either the House at Riverton or the Forgotten Garden.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Good book . Glad there are people like that making life possible for the rest of u in this country.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|AWESOME read...couldn't put it down. 5 Stars from me! It's a wonderful book and you will find yourself unable to put it down until you read the last word.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book is all the more important with the news today of the death of Chris Kyle. Apparently Chris and his friend were shot to death at a gun range in Texas by a veteran with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome that Chris was trying to help through his private foundation to aid veterans with physical and psychological injuries from war.<br /><br />It is tragically ironic that he survived four tours of duty in combat only to be killed in his home state by another veteran he was trying to help. Up to the end Chris gave everything in service to his country and his fellow warriors. Keep this in mind when reading this book.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This was the platform for my first new desktop PC in 14 years. Mate an FX-8350 to it and enjoy. I don't  foresee anything new in operating systems or new connection technology that's going to make me want to upgrade from this, so I'll probably not think of building new again for another 14 years. I wonder what we'll have in 2027....
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have kindle fire us and it works like a charm. Love the app I almost find it easier to use than the computer.
B005UBNKZG|3.0|This is a good processor for a general-use desktop computer, but now that the FX-8300 series is out, you can buy the FX-8150 for the same price as this 8120. Go get the 8150 or move up to the 8300 series for just a little more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS GAME DOES NOT SUCK BALLS ITS THE BEST GAME BUT THE GAME YALL SHOULD GET IS SUBWAY SUFFERS ITS THE BEST GAME EVERY HOPE YOU INJOY MY COMMENT!!!! LOVE GUYS!!!! &lt;3 !!!! :-&gt;
B004OO4UFY|5.0|This band has that old blues and soul sound. His voice mixed with the wide variety of instruments. Dramatic breakdowns that build you right back up. This album gets me in my groove!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and cool. This game makes me hungry because i think of subway. I like all the places where they travel too. Its just like temple run 1. But temple run 2 is so so so so so much fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a fun game to play, the graphics are really good. I haven't gotten very far yet, but I'm sure it will continue to entertain.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Very good product is designed with high warm, I recommend it for use in 100% satisfied with the product purchased thanks.
034580404X|5.0|Worth the money...very good book! The author does and excellent job describing everything in detail!<br />You will enjoy it alot!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I don't even get online on the computer any more so mutch better a a app it does it all
B005LAIHE0|3.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It had some interesting scenes and the idea of moving across country to be with someone does happen, folks.  Hollywood's idea of Michigan though is off-it does not snow all the time and the Ann Arbor area is not a hot bed of deer hunting-oh well.  I don't think this movie was meant to be a side splitting comedy so don't expect continuous laughs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it.is a great game for kid and terns and if you something better either get the xbox360 version or the Pc/ Mac version
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I cant put this game down! I've had it for a week and I love it! I am not a gamer so it took me a bit to figure out how to work the game but now I'm moving up in difficulty. It really is a fun game and very realistic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its really awesome but it should stay updated with the xbox edition and the Pc version but other than that its awesome
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Great movie!  I've watched it 4 times in the week since I got it.  Reminded me a lot of Bring It On, a movie about cheer leading competitions...Pitch Perfect is all about a cappella.
B009KNPM9W|5.0|Trouble Man 40th Anniversary Expanded Edition<br /><br />I owed this album on vinyl and it was alway within easy reach of my Technics SL-1200 turntable. As CD became the new format, one of my first purchases was the CD of Trouble Man.<br /><br />For a long while I wondered about an Expanded Edition of this classic album. The soundtrack heard in the movie was markedly different to the album version, with a version of the title song that had Marvin's falsetto doubled by him cooly speaking the lyrics.<br /><br />Where are the nearly 200 cues, tracks and songs Marvin composed for the movie?<br /><br />It is hard to state a preferred track on the Trouble Man soundtrack as all compositions are stunning, funky and remarkable but the one that inspired the most curiosity was \\"T\\" Plays It Cool. Who played the extraordinary drums on that monster funk track?<br /><br />The rumour was that Marvin, as he had on many of the first Motown hits, had actually played the drums on \\"T\\" Plays It Cool. Was this true? I had to know.<br /><br />Finally an Expanded Edition of Trouble Man has been released. It has a lot to live up to after the fantastic Expanded Editions of What's Going On (1971), Let's Get It On (1973), Here, My Dear (1978) and In Our Lifetime (1981).<br /><br />Trouble Man Expanded Edition has the original 13 track remastered Album, sounding as new and funky as ever, followed by The \\"T\\" Sessions, 9 previously unreleased tracks, including an unedited version of \\"T\\" Plays It Cool, which is simply amazing and 19 tracks, reconstructed from the master tapes, of the original Movie score as heard in the film.<br /><br />The question about who actually played the drums on \\"T\\" Plays It Cool is left unanswered even with the informative 33 page booklet, yet maybe that is for the best.<br /><br />This is an astounding Expanded Edition and a recommended purchase for anyone that likes music directly channelled from God.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|Grest movie and great price!!  I got this for a Christmas gift for a family member and it is watched over and over again!! Def a fav!!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this little monkey who we call \\"George.\\"  It has been her best buddy since she was about 4 months old and she's now 13 months. She does not care about any other pacifier except for this one and never has. If a baby could be addicted to something, our is addicted to George!  For those looking for a way to wash, I just throw him into the washing machine in a lingerie bag with the rest of her clothes and let him air dry.  My only concern is how we'll ever wean her off of him because this is definitely her lovey!
0937381888|4.0|I am just getting into the hobby of home brew. I research everything before I jump in...making this my 2nd book on the hobby.(home brewing for dummies was 1st...and excellent I might add!)<br />\\"How to brew\\" really goes into detail on the hobby, from making starter cultures to reading a water analysis report from your water supplier. While I did learn quite a bit from reading this book and will use it as a reference in the future...I had a few disappointments too.<br />PROS:<br />1. Really in depth information<br />2. Gives mathematical formulas to figure out different aspect of beer, like gravity and color.<br />3. Directions for extract brewing and all grain brewing.<br />4. Directions how to build some of your own equipment..like wort chillers and lauter tuns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Not many recipes<br />2. Hop and yeast choices really incomplete, and only generic information on the ones listed.<br />3. No description of different beer style or how to brew them.<br />4. Directions can be a little hart to follow and are a little dated.<br />5. Needs more pictures to help the reader follow.<br /><br />The cover of the book says, \\"how to brew beer right the first time\\". So, all of us beginners might find it hard to follow...so I don't recommend it as a 1st book. I do recommend, \\"Home brewing for dummies\\" as a 1st book, and I also recommend \\"beersmith 2\\" software to download onto your computer, It has all of those calculations I mentioned before all built in...making home brew easy and fun.
B009X2U4L6|4.0|Spawn is a cool concept of a superhero--the story of Spawn and his demonic adversaries is interesting, and Spawn has an interesting array of superpowers. Keep in mind, however, that it is a dark story with a lot of crude humor. The visual effects are very dated as well. If you can enjoy the story for its creative elements and the unfolding of Spawn's superpowers, you will enjoy this movie (like I did). Otherwise, probably best to skip it.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Movie was filmed just a couple of miles from my home so had to go see it.  I thought is was great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|To me this game is just right for me! Thank you for making this game it is amazing from josee Appavoo
B005LAIISA|5.0|Love the characters. It's just one of those feel good movies for those days when your feeling down or the weather is crappy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is awesome it is cool and I loooovvvvvveee it my 9 year old is addicted to it every time she gets home she plays it
B007MDB6L0|4.0|You have to love Tink. She reminds me of my daughter. Sometimes nosey but always means well when she gets into trouble.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This show is amazing.  The cast is great and the story line is crazy and scary.  One of the best shows ever in my book.
B003B02O0A|5.0|i did see the movie years ago... the book is always better..loved it..john grisham is a good writer and i do like  his older books better than his newer ones
B0063GORYU|4.0|its not exactly intuitive to figure out. the layout is a little weird. other than that, works great on my kindle fire.
B001SYX4S2|5.0|I had to watch this movie for my ethics class and write about some of the themes within. It's really hard discerning who abused their power more. I wont say no more! Watch the movie! I loved it!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Love this!  I love how it's laid out and I love that I can personalize each book to different lengths and colors and whatnot.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I use facebook often, but live with it, meaning I can take it or leave it. It is Okay to use though.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I use this often.  I like how it's broken up into 36 hour wx info and then the 10 day weather info.  I wish there was a little more information on what it's overall supposed to be doing each day but the app itself is fine.  I like the sunset and sunrise being on there as well.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you like The Hobbit or Harry Potter, you will love these books. A combination of the nights of the round table and science fiction, entertaining and well written.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Does what it is supposed to.  I have used this a few times and it works just fine.  I like that it fits the screen.  :)  And I like that what I inputed stays on the screen.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|I like this app and use it regularly to stay updated with science news and new research. the only problem is that you cannot use your university sign in to get full Pdf files. but it is good for skimming topics so that you can further research later.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|This is good entertainment for kids.  I had hoped that it would be more adult friendly with the ability to do some finer details,.  It passes the time.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|i liked playing it but its more sensitive and not as good as the first temple run and i dont like when i tey to turn it wont
B004A7NDPI|5.0|A great version of the Sherlock Holmes concept.  I think I have found a very good new show to keep up with.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|Tim Burton did a great job with this movie. It's fun and entertining for kids and adults. Great story, lots of laughs!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is great but needs the 0.6.1 update. The update should be out by now and I'm anxious. Is amazon to lazy or did mojang not release it to the kindle fire nd. It is out on ios so when will it be out for kindle fire HD?
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was a very refreshing and tear-jerking read. It illustrates a that there aren't always movie endings, but life does go on.<br />Perfectly orchestrated characters and beautiful prose made this book one of my favorites.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I saw this movie ages ago and it still is a cute and funny movie.  (The Dustin Hoffman's southern accent is terrible though.)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful show and probably the best show in yearsf from PBS.  I bought the series due to work schedules and so I can watch it again and catch up at any time.  This is a must see!!
B002SAUCBC|4.0|As usual Stephen King does not disappoint , way more gruesome writing as Bachman. I loved the story but it was brutal.  ALways looking for the pearls, those paragraphs , sentences, or phrases that make you say,&#34; what did he just say?&#34; so I go and reread a few times and try to take it all in. I swear I am going to start a notebook and write down King's pearls among the swine&#62;.<br />The ending left me flat and i wanted more but reread the ending a few times and eventually was satisfied
B007D2XSW0|5.0|nice app!  fun and easy to use....great effects.  take your photos to the next level.  worth the low price for all the cool features!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I scoffed at this game until I tried it and have to say it is a great time passer for doctor's offices, and appointment waiting.  I do not like it that you have to buy the extra birds, slingshots, bombs, etc. You should be able to earn them for free if you do well.
0740748475|5.0|I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and was glad to see that it came with plenty of time to spare. It was much cheaper than the same book collection in any store and I was so happy to find it here on Amazon! Thank you. :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I did not like the title and almost did not buy it even though I did like president Kennedy. I was a senior in HS when he was shot. the story is way more than Kennedy's assassination. It is rich and deep and layered with pearls and life lessons and such poignancy yet it is a thriller I could not put down. Wonderful read.  Don't miss it. One of the best King books and I have read many. .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An amazing game. If you like temple run you'll enjoy this game oh so much. With loads of characters and upgrades it will captivate you. Definitely will be popular for Rio 2016.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun addicting game. Good way to pass the time :) I recommend it to anyone looking to sharpen your reflexes and pass the time.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|EASY TO OPEN, COMPACT, WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?  I HAVE A 6&#34; KINDLE, NOT KINDLE FIRE, BUT THIS CASE IS STILL PERFECT.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun and full of different things to do with your virtual horse. The graphics are beautiful. I love any game where you work to increase your level, so that is enjoyable for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of my favorites shows ever! I really enjoyed the tv pass so that I could watch the whole season early.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Hands down best movie of the year. That being said, this was my first Blueray purchased since I bought a new Sony Blueray player and I'm sold, will never go back to DVD. LOL
B00AG8GTY2|5.0|From the opening note to the last ending note this album absolutely holds you captivated. Every song is great and really fresh when they released this album in 1969. Amazing that it only sold well in the south until they played the Fillmore in NYC later on. At that point the rest of the country finally caught up to what the south already knew...The Allman Brothers Band had taken over the direction of music and they weren't looking back.<br /> I can't express how amazing and great this album is or how it changed the music world. Southern Rock, Rock, Blues, Blues Rock whatever you may call it, I call it Great! Everyone now knows how great Duane and Dickey were by now and that they were always brilliant working together here and from then on but Berry Oakley really opened a world of bass players ears with his fantastic style and unique way. Butch & Jaimoe on skins and Gregg on the B3 and his fantastic soulful vocals even at such a young age. This band is everything a band should be and would aspire to be.<br /> I saw them often and prior to this album being released and so many times afterwards that I couldn't begin to know how many times I saw the original group. I have seen every combination of musicians that have been in ABB but this first lineup is far and away the best for me. Possibly because I was there when they started and I love this group. After all the changes of musicians because of Duane and Berry being gone they once again take you away when you see them Live because of Derek Trucks breathing new life into the group.<br /> There is no way anyone who listens to this album/disc and likes music as well as great arrangements and stellar playing could ever once say about this album \\"Don't want you no more\\" and off the album. This is the kind of band \\"Dreams\\" are made of....I<br /> Just honestly can't imagine anyone who truly enjoys music not owning and listening to this album on a regular basis, it is one of the most important albums of all time and a brilliant recording!<br /> If you don't own this Album/CD, get it, if you don't, \\"It's not my cross to bear\\"
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Can't wait to see the next one. I streamed this movie from Amazon and quality was perfect. I would'nt spend the money for the Blueray but the movie was good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the first book I've read in a long time besides a text book and I didn't think I was going to make it through but I did and it was great. I can't wait to start part 2!!
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I purchased this DVD (Full Screen) as a gift for my daughter, she has the other movies on the same format and I wanted to make her set complete. She is happy with DVD quality so who's to argue.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|i love twilight and i have loved every single sound track! this is a great soundtrack with great songs. highly recommend!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game different in a good way.  definitely a step up from the first and much better than some of these other runner games.
B00866JL96|5.0|OMG AMAZING LOVE STORY! It's so sweet and gentle. Heartbreaking, intense, and I loved every single minute of this movie. :)
B000V39KDO|5.0|The video quality started out bad (and we have a bad in internet connection which seemed to affect the quality really badly) but after a while it picked up and cleared up. It looked great from that point on.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have loved every harry potter movie ever. This one is no exception. I loved every minute. WOnderful ending to the series :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!! I recommend this game to people who love animals and horses!!  One thing that i love about this game is that u get to interact with a horse and its so cool!!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Got for my boyfriend. He loved it! I finally watched all the movies after getting this. They look amazing in blueray! highly recommend for fans! great movies!!
B003IDMUVI|5.0|I have read a couple of John Gresham books and for me this is the best. The thing about his novels are that you can't any one down until it's finished. Now I am on to another book,\\"the litigators\\".
B00447L4JG|5.0|This has always been a favorite movie of mine. Nothing has changed. Still a great movie! I love halloween so it's perfect!
B008YCMM2A|5.0|Recently I read Miles Davis' autobiography for the second time.  He has been my favorite musician ever since he introducted me to the world of serious jazz in 1971 when I bought his Grammy winning Bitches Brew album.  This is the lost quintet from 1969-70 he thought had not been recorded by Columbia live much to his regret but as it turns out it was!! It was truly one of his best bands and they describe the world around us.  The music is more true now than it was then-a mind blown world
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was amazing! It was a fantastic roller coaster of emotions. I was instantly addicted, which was great! It jumped RIGHT in, no waiting around for the good stuff. I was hooked and I couldn't put it down. I loved the love story, all the drama, it was a great book. I'd read it again and again. Abby and Travis are my new favorite couple. Dysfunction, drama, fighting, love, romance. Everything about this book was fantastic. I loved it! It had well developed characters, a great story line, and every page made me want to read the next. Fantastic book
B0000DC13U|5.0|This excellent and at time disturbing movie is not about the Devil at all.  Though he is and has been having a field day due to the mind of today's world and that is actually what this movie describes.  And also the disillusionment of the director Jean-Luc Godard
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I think I love every single song on this CD. TAylor is amazing. Great CD. It's fantastic! Every fan needs this CD :)
B008P1EWIM|5.0|As I said in the subject line...This App has beautiful graphics. You can add a lot of cities making your own the main one. Temperature, forecast for several days, wind direction and speed, current time and more. Lots of information for a $1.99 App. I would recommend this to anyone who makes plans several day ahead or even plans on visiting another city. Check it out. Well worth the money.
1451696191|5.0|Wow. What can I say about this book? I read it in one night! I was addicted from the moment I started until I finished late at night. It reminded me of a book we would be required to read for school in high school. It definitely brought back memories for me. It was very life like and relate-able in so many ways. I loved that it was like a diary but in letter form. I hadn't been expecting that but I felt as though it made the book more personal-able and private. I found that this book was definitely different from things I normally read (paranormal, contemporary romance, mystery, etc.). But I loved it. I fell in love with Charlie and everything about him. He was the type of friend I believe everyone deserves and more. It was such a sweet and touching story. I loved reading his freshman year experience. I cannot wait to see the movie and relive the story once again.<br /><br />Again, another top favorite of the year :)
B00AKO93JK|4.0|Easy to follow & perfect if I can't make the gym. I like that you can program a routine too.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This was such a cute movie. I really enjoyed it. It was sweet, gentle, hearbreaking, and lovely. Great love story!
B00004XPPC|5.0|This is one of our family favorites, and what a great price! We collect DVD's for my father. This is one of his all-time favorite movies.
B00127RAJY|5.0|for anyone looking for short workouts that really are intense, look here! i love this DVD for just a quick work out. it's great for limited time or days when you dont feel like doing an hour work out. love it!
B0096PAA6E|4.0|I like the cd over all only one track I could do without . open your ears and enjoy the tunes.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|great song! one of my top favorites! i enjoy it and listen to it all the time! highly recommend! :)
B004SIP9U6|5.0|This is such a fun movie to watch. The actors seemed to be having a good time and played their parts with pleasure.  Of course the writer of the screenplay/story was having fun with history, but it was worth my time to watch it in the theater when it came out and I was happy to purchase it for my own viewing, over and over again.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|i love britney. the CD is great. she makes great songs. i love her. even if she is crazy. still love it!
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Not a bad movie, however lacks depth.  If you're looking for a dark movie with little depth, then this will fit the bill.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I could not put this book down! It was great! Kind of slow to start but then it was awesome.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie!! Super funny and I plan to buy it when it comes out on DVD. Wanted to rent more than once
B005LAII3U|3.0|Thillering new adaptation. A must see for all sci-fi fans. High octane, fast paced chase scenes and awesome visuals, really make this this movie enjoyable.  Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|SUBWAY SURFERS IS THE GREATEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED---EVER!!! IT'S ADDICTIVE,AWESOME,COLRFUL,INTERESTING,& EXCITING!! I COULD PLAY THIS GAME 24/7 AND NEVER GET BORED,I SWEAR!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is amazing, am absolutely boggled about it. Definitely buy this! WARNING: THIS ITEM CONTAINS ADDICTING GAMEPLAY! You've been warned!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I've never seen the old one but this is just an exciting reinventive movie. Played this one twice. Great city concepts...that made you imagine that future world ('That could happen').
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Another great one. It starts out a little slow but is a good page turner. I love that reading his books makes you feel like you are learning something and inspires really deep conversations with friends as opposed to just killing time for entertainment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy Downton Abbey! The actors and actresses are really good and I really love the beautiful scenery in the series.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|A wonderfully descriptive piece of writing. Erin Morgenstern makes fantasy believable.  If you love stretching your imagination and letting an adventure unfold, then this is the book for you, I absolutely loved it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this book was one of the best books i've read in along time.  I would definitely read this book again!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. The only thing, is it switches off and glitches after about 1,500,000 points, and its kind of aggravating. Other than that, AMAZING GAME!!!! I never wanna put it down :))))
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Best app I had no problems of whatsoever great app to pass time with free and is worth the download.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it!!!! I can not get away from it, it too much fun!!!! I just got it yesterday because my friend told me to and I love it!!! I think they should make new places to buy with coins that you can go!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome in the morning it really gets my heart going I love this game so much and I rate it five stars
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER IT HAS A LOT OF DETAILS AND IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO ME IT IS IT HA  A LOT  OF PICTURES TOO.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome! I love the characters I'm in Rio right now it's fantastic. It's way better than temple run
B007QUUJMG|4.0|A 16-year-old introvert taken under the wings of two eccentric seniors. Anonymous letters to a &#34;friend&#34; about his thoughts and experiences. Mishaps and mayhem in relationships. Drives with friends listening to the perfect song. Sounds to me like the makings for a good book on teenage life, love and disaster.<br />And that's just what it is. Perks of Being a Wallflower tells us of the true teenage high school experience. Coping with his first year of high school, his friends suicide, and his first crush, Charlie steps onto a rollercoaster that shoots him into life and causes him to 'participate'. But life is never quite so simple when you're a teenager. There is always some twist or turn waiting for you around the next corner.<br />Perks of Being a Wallflower is the perfect book on the teenage struggle to find who you are and I highly recommend it to anyone coping with their own teenage problems, anyone studying belonging or journeys in school, or for parents/ adults to give you an insight into what those mysterious creatures in the room next to you that you call teenagers may be dealing with.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|The storyline was GREAT! Sunny was funny,Violet was creative,Klaus was very intelligent. To bad Count Olaf got away.:( Can't wait until I read the next book!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|Very in depth and  multiple definitions. More than an average dictionary. Great for all ages up through high school and beyond.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|One thing that I can always count on is a great read from Nicholas Sparks!  He never fails to build a great story that sucks me right in.  Truly one of my faves and I look forward to each new book he comes out with!  Definite must read!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Not only was this a great and inspiring story, it gave a great history of recent events in Africa.  It is amazing to learn about what someone can do, even against all odds, if they keep at it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks its just like temple run but better. U r in a subway and running from a Baird. How can u not get it. Get the game u will be happy u did.
B0031ES8P6|4.0|It arrived fast but it did have a small dirty spot on it's white fur that I had to scrub off before I could give it as a gift.
B000HX4ZF6|3.0|Regarding Amazon Instant Video<br />My equipment: non-HDTV, Wii, DSL. When streaming is good, the picture is good but when it's not, then portion of picture is pixelated.<br />The movie is good and would rate it 3.5-4 (out of 5) stars. Note violence and blood.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|it was fun while it lasted. on my kindle fire it worked for the first time, but then whenever I tried 2 open it, it doesn't let me :'( It was really fun though and I wish it would work on my kindle!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I was very surprised by this album.  Not what I would expect from Bocelli, but it is a beautiful album.  He sings in Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English.  Some of the tracks are covers of famous songs, others seem to be originals.<br /><br />While those that expect the \\"opera\\" Bocelli might be disappointed, the lyrics are beautiful... if you understand them (I suppose that's where some of the negative reviews come from).
B005723JSQ|4.0|Read it for a book club, Cheesy and a little far fetched but I enjoyed it. Would recommend it for girls who like love stories.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My son and i are enjoying this one! He especially enjoys grooming her and giving her treats!  The competions are cool to
0930289234|5.0|This is the classic Watchman graphic novel.  It's amazing and you should read it if you haven't.  If you have and don't own it, you should pick it up.  Not sure what else to say.  A brilliant deconstruction of superheroes, there's a reason this book is still selling after all these years.
B0037NVM2C|4.0|\\"Terminator 2\\" is a decent sequel to the original [[ASIN:B00153ZC8Q The Terminator]] and I can't believe that it took me this long to write a review since we watch this movie at least once a year.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The movie picks up some time in future where John Connor (Edward Furlong) is now a very rude and annoying teenager, Sara Connor (Linda Hamilton, who got in amazing shape for this movie) is committed in a maximum security mental institution, and a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger, brawny as ever) is sent back in time along with a very cool updated T-1000 Terminator (well played by Robert Patrick). The acting, action, and special effects are top notch, but the movie is somewhat hampered by weak dialog between John and The Terminator, but honestly it isn't that distracting and dialog really is not why we watch these movies.<br /><br />This is a strong addition to The Terminator franchise.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is must read and read again kind of book. I couldn't put it down the first or last time I read it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Although this book is very long, I found it interesting and fun to read throughout.  This novel has elements of science fiction, historical fiction, and romance.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is way better than the first temple run, but it needs to get some updates because at time it shows some leg and can become choppy
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I love HIMYM!!!! My boyfriend stay in bed on the weekends to see season 1 again and again!!!! We never get tired of it!!! I'm glad we found it here on Amazon!!!
B0001I561E|5.0|finally, been looking for this dvd for a while. i req help checking out with this purchase and the service rep was very helpful.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Loved this book.  Could hardly put it down, once I started.  It seemed realistic & very relevant in today's political climate. It was great. it will not disappoint you.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Listen to it a few times and you will fall in love with Leonard Cohen. The only thing better is seeing him in person.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is a great author,  I have read all of his books.  It had a plot twist I wasn't expecting but that is what made it so good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awsome if you dont know what this game is ill explain it....... BEAST!!!!!!. IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU :D
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not into giving or receiving physical or emotional pain.  I understand that there might be folks out there that might enjoy this sort of garbage.
B0098XY5VK|3.0|i like this game but it gets annoying smetimes like how the costomers attitude is i mean CALM DOWN!!!! SERIOUSLY
B009UX2YAC|5.0|as soon as I unlocked carmen, my game decided to glitch up and erase. thanks a lot. I permanantly lost toni and elf tricky. amazing game though, If it wasn't always so glitchy and laggy :(
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i think this game is really fun. I hope they come out with a number two with better gadget  and better stuff period
B004DTXJ4S|5.0|Lots of action very good special effects.  Liked the actors and they played there parts very well.  The monsters were unreal.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|this game sucks the demo is so short i mean ive seen better demos than this i mean serioiusly. they should just minecraft pocket a ddition free
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|As always, Tina delivers a hilarious account of her life & all its craziness. I'm going to miss 30 Rock!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is  out of your mind you got to get this  becasause when you play it on the kindle it is much more clear and it looks more advanced
0756655307|4.0|Got it for a Christmas present.  It was exactly what I wanted to give.  Recepient liked it a lot.  Happy happy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You got to read all 3 , great story, make you pray people  need get this heartless .Love over come all.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Each episode is very entertaining. The writers are very talented. I like the stories as they are different from any other TV show I have watched. So I consider B-B original and fresh.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was good book,I stayed  up late to see what was going to happen  next.It going to be hard to find books that I liked  as much.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|very good movie i watch the original judge dredd and this was a great remake in comparision alot more action and just a great story overall everyones not gonna agree since everyone has there own taste in movies but for me it was well worth renting i would highly recommend to those who love action movies or sci fi
159420411X|5.0|Very few things define the era we live in right now in 2013 more than the overload and availability of information. Nate Silver aptly puts some of the work &#34;experts&#34; do into perspective, when they attempt to sift through the data to find the relevant chords that will help them predict an outcome. From economics to weather to baseball to politics, he gives accurate assessments and food for thought. A wise person can see what's coming. Read this book and you'll be a little bit wiser.
B00B01XDTI|3.0|This movie was good, but it just didn't have a pleasing story. It focused more on the scary and outrageous looking characters of Silent Hill. It's fun to watch it once or twice, but after that it just gets boring. Good movie to watch if you've seen other great films or are just bored and need something to watch cause there is nothing else to watch.
B006VREHRS|5.0|When Boardwalk Empire came out on HBO in the wake of the Saprano'[s I remember hearing from several people that they were disapointed that it was not as good as the Saprano's, and that they couldn't accept Steve Buscemi in the &#34;boss&#34; role.  I recently decided to give the show a try and realized how foolish I was to have waited this long.  Like the Soprano's the show is fantastic but beyond that comparison's are of the &#34;apples and oranges&#34; variety.  Buscemi's role on Boardwalk Empire as Nucky Thompson is complex and his acting is outstanding.  In my humble opinion Boardwalk ranks right up there with the best that HBO has presented to date.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I am a &#34;MOVIE NUT&#34;, especially Horror Movies, but The Walking Dead is My number 1,  top Movie, ever! You know I cannot wait for the next episode, I watch the previous episodes daily and I watch them over & over never getting bored of them. I rate the show 200% Thumbs-Up {smile}.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A fantastic insight into an unknown piece of history.  The author takes us on a journey into two completely different lives of the two main characters.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|And Tony Scott, may he rest in peace, did one hell of a job directing it. There are a lot of staples of a Q.T film in this one. Except for the trunk-vision scene, which is something I always look forward to in a Quentin Tarantino movie. But the vocabulary, the movie references, the Sicilian scene, the mexican standoff just to name a few were some of the scenes. This one felt a bit more intense than some of the others. I wasn't sure who was going to die in the end. The soundtrack was great, every did a great job from Slater and Arquette to Walken and Kilmer. Even the few seconds you see Brad Pitt or Samuel L. Jackson was fun. But then again, Sam Jackson is in just about everything. Scott did an incredible job directing the movie from the romance between Bama and Clarence to the bloodiest and most violent moments of the film. For all fans of Tarantino, crime movies or even a good love story, you will love this amazing and even overlooked piece of cinematic history. Fun plot, big all-star cast and enough blood and gore to make every over-protective parent want to eradicate every last copy.
B008N1LL42|5.0|This was a great action movie for anyone who is a sci-fi lover. There was a good story line and I though Bryanna is a very excellent performance; very enjoyable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this version better than the first.  My kids like the first version better.  Both were free, so try them both and see which you prefer.
B007NQLK3K|5.0|This was a great gift for a movie gru! Fit right into his collection and is front and center. We be getting the rest of the series as future gifts
B009AMALLM|3.0|At 00:38:41 in the extended edition after the actress switches off the toy train and gets out of the room you can hear a woman whispering the name \\"Kevin\\" , did anyone hear that?<br /><br />It could be from the film crew , or , it could be what is known in the ghost hunting world as an EVP (Electronic voice phenomena )<br />If it is a real EVP then this DVD will be a must have , if not , then this is as mentioned in other posts , the weakest of the series.The story is about the whereabouts of Hunter the boy kidnapped in part two, we meet a family of four , mother and father big sister young brother, then the weird neighbors arrive and the drone score begins. The good scares are at the end , the rest were normal,they even took out the post credit scene shown in theatres from this DVD - check it out in youtube.But we did learn a good trick to do with your Xbox kinect , they even used it in a Ghost Adventures episode .<br /><br />Anyway , if you're a fan buy it , the ending is good, non fans see part one.
B009E3EY38|5.0|This is one of the best Blu Rays I have ever seen.  I love Led Zeppelin this was a birthday gift for husband but I enjoyed it too.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this series.  I watch it while running on the treadmill and it makes the time just fly!  Can't wait for the next season.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great album for a great price! The album has 3 more songs than the regular edition, plus the music video for Thrift Shop.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friends are the ones who made me play it.. but now it's my overall favorite game I have a Kindle..so fun to build any thing you want it's fun for all ages my little brother is four years old and he loves it.if you like building this is the game to get..
B00992CF6W|5.0|This thing is awesome and worth the money!!!!!!!!!!! Only in survival mode there is zombies. It is just as addicting as the computer version!!!!! This deserves 5 stars!!!!! U built a mansion in this game and it was worth the money!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is really fun and really cool.  It's awesome because it never ends.  The characters are funky and the graphics are great . Addicting!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|That is, how can we not continue to view the new Bond sagas? Craig adds a new dimension to the Bond character, but I must say that his performance in Casino Reale is better layered than that in Skyfall.
1616550414|5.0|There is not enough nice thighs to say about this piece.<br />It's a magnificent book, its really great.<br /><br />The collective of artwork through the ages is a wonderful to see. There are character designs that never even made it to the games that's great to see.<br />The book even includes a manga of skyward sword in the back of the book translated into English and reads like a traditional manga.<br /><br />I love have this book on my shelf. As a person who collects art books and as a fan of a franchise that I can only define as the Lord of the rings of my generation, this is a Zelda piece that needs to, and I mean NEEDS to be owned by a fan of this franchise.<br /><br />The book calls upon everything a Zelda fan could want. Great art, a manga and a timeline that connects the entirety of the Zelda multiverse.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I think Little Broken Hearts reveals Norah Jones's evolution from an excellent singer to a super-excellent singer. She ranks as my favorite female vocalist.
1452110581|5.0|love the poems, easy to read & passed it on to a friend. good book for younger kids around 10yr's old
B007MDQW3W|5.0|I enjoy Regina Spektor even though I'm beyond her demographics--but then I have a young attitude and love all styles of music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is fun and like you travel around the world running from a police officer and his dog and if you get hit the police officer pick him up and shake him or her
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I wasn't as taken by The Dark Knight Rises as I was the first two. In my opinion, the reason for Bruce Wayne's depression and his conflict with Alfred is not well-done, nor is Wayne's attraction to Cat Woman.  Too many lapses, too many explosions, and Alfred's dream of seeing Bruce Wayne with the love of his life at an outdoor bar is cheesy.
B004132HZS|5.0|PBS Series that updates the stories with current technologies.  Was fun to watch on TV and the person I gave it too really enjoyed it
B000E5N6LG|3.0|I had hoped that the characterization of Wyatt Earp would unfold from its promise of a complex character. The pacing and length prevented me from showing it in one of my classes. Wyatt Earp kept me out of that Field of Dreams.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|PBS Series that updates the stories with current technologies.  Was fun to watch on TV and the person I gave it too really enjoyed it
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Initially wanted to have a couple of days to read this book.  I am so grateful that my busy schedule forced me to read this awesome story over an extended period of time mainly because it is so excellent!  Highly recommended!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game! It was very addicting and fun for adults and children. I would recommend this app! I loved it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Overall fun game. It's like having your own horse without all the real cost. Nice that there are different options of stuff to buy.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|snow white and the huntsman great adaptation of a fairy tale. tipical hollywood  script. great graffics a must see great special effects. lots of action scenes
1451688091|5.0|Doris really outdid herself this time.She really brings Lincoln to life. And how very very similar were his rivals to him. Could read this again and again
B0036OS3N8|5.0|Not only are these boots cute, they are awesome!  I snagged a pair of these when they were on sale and boy am I glad that I did!  I have to say first off that I listened to other reviewers and I too purchased a size bigger than what I would normally wear.  (These arent offered in half sizes.)  They are nice and roomy.  Everyone who lives in a cold climate knows that snug boots only contribute to making your feet even colder.  I cant even believe that these are boots!  When Im wearing these I feel like Im walking around in a pair of the comfiest slippers EVER!  They are super easy to put on.  Its easy to tuck pant legs into them.  Who the heck wants wet pants from wearing jeans down over their boots? LOL!<br />I had these on again today and it was about 12 degrees outside MY FEET WERENT COLD!!!!!  That says ALOT for a pair of boots!  Especially because most winter boots seem like they are designed to be worn in a California type of winter!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is one of the best shows out there.  It combines humor and mystery with just the right amount of drama to keep you coming back for more.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always liked Mahjong and this app is just right for my kindle.  It has lots of puzzles and like angry birds, I can retry for a better score.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the book well enough and it definitely kept me turning pages as quickly as I possibly could, but the ending was a joke.  I can't imagine reading another novel by this author for fear of another crappy ending.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 seems as engaging as seasons 1 & 2 so far.  I had missed the first two seasons and decided I wanted to start watching but wanted to catch up first. Amazon prime online enabled me to be able to watch seasons 1 & 2 for free via my DVD player & the first few episodes of season 3 for $1.99.  I am now caught up & can watch shows live!!
B0001VTPWM|5.0|What more can I say. All 3 is linked together, although the main actor(Murphy) did not return in the 3 series, it is still worth collecting.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|me whatever the problem is they need to fix it. this game could be great if they could make it work
079284131X|5.0|This is a must have horror movie. The very classic nature of this movie shows us how a doll can be terrifying.
0439023491|4.0|Like someone said, with trilogies the problem is that middle book. Maybe reading them back to back isn't such a great idea, maybe your expectations are too high or maybe, you just reach a saturation point with the story, I don't really know what it was but I loved The Hunger Games (book 1) and I got a wee bit bored with the whole Peeta-Gale-Peeta-Gale boy-talk with Katniss there for a while ... and all this with no real sexual scenes at all - the poor guys don't even get a break.<br /><br />The writing is superb, it's Suzanne Collins and she is a fantastic writer. The build-up in the life after for the tributes was a little slow until the Quarter Quell games started. I did enjoy the games and alliances a lot more in this book and I am definitely reading the next one too but I'm just not in that much of a hurry.<br /><br />My favorite parts in this book: Everything about Finnick, he almost came close to being my favorite character. Peeta's leadership qualities and his saint-like approach to everything is nice and all but I loved Finnick and his sense of humor and his practical approach.<br /><br />The climax was unexpected and surprising, so bravo Collins for delivering again and not disappointing at the height of the novel. I felt a strong connection to Katniss and found her to be funnier even though her situation was more desperate than book 1. Maybe goes to show that we all adapt to crazy circumstances in our lives.<br /><br />If you are going to read the trilogy, gotta start in book 1 or nothing will make sense, and I'll see you in Book 1, guys! Hope this review was useful!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|R.I.P Chris.<br />1974-2013<br />You will be missed, but Never forgotten.<br />You have been an inspiration to a great number of people.<br />Thank You for your service.<br />Gods Speed
B009LXEBD4|5.0|EXCELLENT!! Love every song! I have all her cd's and this is perfect. Plus it has some new songs, duets, and a Christmas song.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I am a newer fan of Macklemore and I came across this album and was extremly pleased with how good it was, I don't normally buy full albums because I only like a couple songs on it but I was pleased with every song on this album
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first I found playing this game pretty difficult, then I watched my 5 year old niece play & I got hooked. It's a great way to pass the time.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|can hardly wait for the next one to come out, this had a lot of action in it and was very entertaining.
030758836X|2.0|Don't want to spoil the end for everyone but I did not get the ending I wanted!!! Good concept for a story line but something was just missing.
B00A4FOWYQ|3.0|I have to say I'm not the biggest T&S fan, but I really enjoy Sainthood. This album is just plain boring. All the tracks sound the same. I think it's an odd move for them. I was really hoping to like this album after all the good reviews I read. Their voices sound better than ever, but the music just doesn't fit.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the upgraded graphics!! This is a great sequel to an already great game. Good job developer's. I love great quality free games just like this one
1439156816|5.0|I use this book in my advanced writing class.  Easy and fun to read with great quotes that I share with my class.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I have Titanic on VHS but having it on DVD is awesome!  I love this movie...not the tragedy of the ship sinking but the story that is told of love and facing your fear and not living in someone else dream of a great life!!
0465011047|4.0|Very educational and easy to read.  What a world! I wish the government of North Korea would follow Russia and East Germany and make the choices that would ease the suffering of their people.  Makes its point without being preachy.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Me and my wife watch this together. She actually got me hooked on it! I had to watch it from the beginning and once I started I could not stop! This is one of the only two shows out right now that is not a piece of crap on television right now. I can not wait for season eight to be released! Thank you for reading my review.<br />Tyler F.
0670023329|4.0|Made me want to read more about the plight of many North Koreans. It mentioned a book called the Aquariums of Pyongyang which I also read and it was very good as well.<br />So many problems there and it doesn't seem like there is much we can do.  A lot of suffering.  Neither book is preachy and they don't belabor the point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great app for the \\"on-the-go\\" fun when you are bored or when you just want to take a brake from work or from life.  Subway Surfers is a great or personally, I think it is a better version of Temple Run with a more realistic setting.  There are multiple lanes on this app to run and dodge ornjump and more power ups and more characters than Temple Run also.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is amazing!! it has ziplines. and has alot better grafics. you shoud get this app!!! it is alot better than #1.
B005LAIISU|5.0|Fun storyline! Love the personalities of the gang. Not so much into the music but it's tolerable. A great addition to your Ice Age collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way more fun then temple run one, i love the ropes and that you can collect gems and that you can have a second chanse
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Just as great as his first CD! Bruno Mars displays his singing and composing skills. Easy listening tunes that will play in your mind for a long time.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|on the kindle fire the game often force closes when the Save Me button is used. Super annoying. I'm afraid to use the button most of the time
B005LAII08|3.0|Great price for this collection. Love listening to the lilt in the voices. Storyline good. Merida caused the problem but at least she fixed it. Merida wasn't the most respectful child but she did come full circle and learn.
0670026603|5.0|This is one of those books that grabs you and hangs on. I had this same feeling with Bernice McFadden's SUGAR and Jesmyn Ward's SALVAGE THE BONES.<br /><br />Will Traynor is a paraplegic and he was such an active fellow that he doesn't like the thought of spending the rest of his life in a wheelchair.<br />Luckily, his parents are quite wealthy and can give him the best treatment and entertainment that fit into his capabilities. But it's not enough.<br /><br />They hire Louisa to be a day-helper and she comes in like a breath of fresh air, wearing her bright, eclectic clothing, but not knowing that she has a timeline for how long she may be with Will.<br /><br />She becomes quite close to him. When she takes him to attend the wedding of his ex-girlfriend and his best guy friend, the dance scene will take away your breath.<br /><br />Then she finds that he has given his parents a time limit to try to dissuade him from having an assisted suicide.<br /><br />As I neared the end of the book, I was so torn between which way I thought he should go. I was filled with tension but finally felt that either way would be okay. The scenes leading up to the end are some of the most intense I can remember having with a book in a long while.<br /><br />Now I've learned that MGM has bought the movie rights. I'm going to buy a box of Kleenex to have on hand when the time comes.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|The game is great but the stupid thing won't let me get rid of the ads. What the heck! Thanks a lot Rovio!
B007THA4FI|3.0|It's not Harry Potter, no Wizards, witches  or monsters.  Just the ordinary people living in a typical small town that could be anywhere but is in england.  There are good people, bad people, cheating husbands and people driven by  all teh dreams and desires of ordinarty folks everywhere.  A nice story of ordinary people trying to live in small town England.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome. U can build things beyond your imagination.And if u get the update u can have armour like Xbox.
B007SGM084|3.0|It was ok. Couldn't figure out what all the hype was about. Some of the scenes were steamy, but most were just ok. And really....a virgin who has never even &#34;self-pleasured&#34; and is instantly multi-orgasmic? Damn he must be really good!
B008KRJWEK|4.0|its a good game. lots of action and lots of upgrades. hard and challenging but fun none the less. I recommend it.
B008XG1X18|1.0|its pretty good, but I don't like it. I have some problems with it. but that's ok. I still use it sometimes.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|The author really captures Bobby' s voice and your attention here. A must for any Supernatural fan. I recommend it highly.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I loved this book and loved the movie too; Although, they are two completely different things. Good time with everything
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I like the game.  I always have played on computer so was glad to get it on Kindle.  Don't like some of the pics on the tiles but would not hesitate to recommend.
B008476HBM|5.0|I had to get this e-book to read for an academic compisition test. Convinient because it was free. Plus a good read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book redefined what it means to read a book for me in the sense that it really brought me to a whole new world! Great book!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Overall a good read but painfully slow in parts developing story that doesn't seem to add much to the experience.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun game.The only thing I reccomend for the update or Subway Surfers 2 is lowered price on people and surf boards.Anyway its good game that I play everyday.
B0043RSK3K|3.0|The authors of this book must believe that the U S leaders have made very few good choices in the last two centuries or longer.  In instance after instance, they assign blame for nearly every conflict to U S greed and bellicosity.  It is so negative that a patriotic American will find it hard to read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|how do I update it on my kindle fire it is amizon and focusing peeeeeessssss I can figure it out
B00APUQH0W|5.0|A really rear baseball movie, and showing life as we grow older, which happens to all of us if we live to a ripe old age.

B00AOMR2S2|5.0|AWESOME!  If you liked the movie you will this sounds just like the songs from the movie. This how they mixed the songs together.
B004W1GCQO|3.0|I think my problem with this is that I saw Downton Abby first and not much compares.<br /><br />Not bad though, just not Downton
B002V9PEUE|5.0|I accidentally ordered this movie and then was too lazy to tell Amazon to cancel it. But that's alright because I watched it with a buddy and had a great time. I'm not sure if this movie is supposed to be funny, but it's hilarious. Not nearly as funny as Demolition Man or Cobra, but pretty good nonetheless.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|Although I feel this season was a little convoluted at times, I thought the over all story<br />was good and interesting.  If you are a dexter fan you definately have to see it, but be<br />sure to start at the beginning of the series.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|Always heard about Patti Smith so I decided to buy one,  she is brilliant,  excentric,  unique.<br /><br />I am happy having bought this CD,  It came in perfect conditions and as advertised.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have thought long and hard why I like this show and I can't<br />put my finger on it.  I am a walking dead, dexter, game of thrones<br />fan and the last thing I expected was to LOVE Downton.  I definately<br />recommend for ANYONE to watch this.
B0031RSBU0|5.0|This book was riveting and essential reading if you are reading the series. Everything was plausible and not only kept you on the edge of your seat, but also was quite emotive. I love the description of the country - you actually feel like you are there - even if you have never had the experience. Excellent read.<br />I wish Amazon would just post the books in the series by number as it's annoying to trawl through each book to find out the number in the series.
0062127241|5.0|I've been following The Who since I first saw them in 1968 at Aaron Russo's Kinetic Playground in Chicago. Townshend is the consummate artist/rocker. Some official admissions- but the guy was everywhere when the best music ever was being created. He is one of the biggest and best. No doubt. A must read for my generation.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|This soundtrack is awesome just like all the other soundtracks in the saga. I love every song on it. This CD has opened me up to a new world of music.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|This is a movie that will take your breath away....I have watched it so many times!!!  Bart the bear does his best acting and of course, the other two stars are too good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Favorite one of the three books. Action packed and full of excitement. I can not wait till this movie comes out
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I'm Amazon stuff all the way. But for the life of me I cannot get the Cloud to open with this application. Downloaded smoothly, icon on the screen, opens my device stored music list. But when I try to open the cloud, I get \\"Exception #151\\" and connection error. I followed all the instructions from the site to get the Cloud side of the application to open, but to no avail. So, I've written this particular app off. My Kindle Fire and my computer and laptop all run the Cloud flawlessly, but not the phone.<br /><br />UPDATE: finally got this to load up and it works fine. now hitches with playback or other issues. Great resource on my Kindle Fire too!
B000SEGUDE|2.0|The time and characters did not tie together as much as I would have expected to find. Overall it did not turn my interest up as I read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's a user-friendly app...I highly recommend it.  the large sized buttons are very much appreciated by those of us with aging eyes!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The hunger games was a very good book. And it lasted a long time. Thank you Suzanne Collins! Awesome book!

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Well, I thought it was ok. I must admit it was a bit infuriating in some parts, but alas it's alluring.
1400069289|5.0|helps demystify why it is so difficult to get rid of a habit which is no longer of use in life. Excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive and fun. If you are a temple run fan this game is for you. You get a change of scenery every month or so. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I was so excited when this collection was offered. This was one of the best written and acted series on television and I began watching the entire series as soon as it arrived. Excellent. Thank you for offering this series at such a reasonable price.
B003MC5N28|5.0|My 5th grader was reading this book at school. I picked it up and could not put it down. Was not happy that he read it in 5th grade.  I believe this is middle school content.  Luckily it was over his head.
1451648537|4.0|I enjoyed Walter Isaacson's no holds barred book about Steve Jobs. I found out perhaps more than I wanted to know about this difficult personality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is so awesome I play it all of the time it is so great BUY NOW
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have played this one multiple times; it is always fun. Make no mistake; it does get challenging and I would recommend it to as anyone who enjoys the match-3 type games.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I read Pillars of the Earth some time ago, and enjoyed it tremendously. It was such a large book that I had to wait a bit before getting into this one, and I was also a little afraid that it might be a disappointment since I'd liked the first book so much.<br /><br />No worries! I think I may have even like World Without End more than Pillars. It was one of those books I had a hard time tearing myself away from when I needed to, and just couldn't wait to get back to it. Rather than being glad to see it end, I just wished I could continue on. Great book!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good short read.  Like the characters, story and good ending. Nothing was over the top. Reality was in this story.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Absolutely love this series.  The plots and sub-plots, costumes, old cars are a treasure.  After my daughter told me I might like Downton Abbey I bought season I and II in order to catch up since season III was just starting on TV.  Also bought an extra DVD player and updated the DVR so I could watch in my sitting room without disturbing hubby.  He insisted I should view it on the big living room TV saying \\"it wouldn't bother him\\".  Well, he got hooked immediately and is now an avid follower and we both watch it on the living room TV.  Surprised the heck out of me as he usually doesn't care for British shows because of the accents which his older ears have trouble understanding.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mine Craft is so thrilling. I am so addictive to the world's.  so hold on to your sword and go start a new adventure and don't kill the animal's.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The title doesn't give the reader too much information of the interesting narrative to follow. A good story grounded a bit in history and a bit in silliness and whimsy.<br /><br />This story reminded me of &#34;Like Water for Elephants&#34;, where we learn about a person's life both through flashbacks and what is happening to him in the present.<br /><br />Touches of wry, gentle humor throughout carries this story along to its happy conclusion. A good read that reminds us all that sometimes the most amazing stories might be discovered by talking to one's own neighbor, friend or relative.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This was a very good book which ended to soon I will tell my<br />sister , she loves these kind of stories.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I heard Muse for the first time this week on a radio program. I didn't know who the band was, so, I wrote the lyrics of the chorus and Googled it. Turns out, it was Muse and their song Uprising. I got onto Amazon and sampled most of their newer albums. I loved their sound and the variety they brought to their music ...alternate, rock, classic. I bought both The 2nd Law and Rebellion albums. I'm a new fan of Muse, and of Matt Bellamy, the singer, guitar/pianiast and main songwriter. I think everyone should check them out. I'm looking forward to hearing more from them.
B008B92U32|4.0|This is a fun little app for goofing around. No problems and easy to use. Definitely download it and try it out.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Makes you look at a common thing (time) in a totally different light. I highly recommend this book..  thank you
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really fun, but it is really hard to get money.  I think if it was easier to get money it would be a little more gunner.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I am constantly amazed how much Stan Lee's work has thrown off in the movies. This could have Ben so trite, like the Clooney and Kilmer Batmans, but this was actually good.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I have no idea how this movie did so well at the box office. My wife really wanted to see it & fell asleep. Mila Kunis was the highlight of this movie and the only item that made it fresh. Would not recommend to ANYONE and certainly not to anyone below 18 yrs of age. Some of the things Ted said were really lame and seemed unnecessary, the whole movie seemed engineered for shock value and NOT entertainment. F-, I would like the 1.5 hours of my life back that I spent watching it, do yourself a favor, and rent &#34;Howard the Duck&#34; instead of TED, it's 1.25 stars would be a higher entertainment value.<br /><br />Snore
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I can't wait for series three. I have just about very Holmes movie made and was skeptical about his series. I was more than pleasantly surprised.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game has definately improved compareing it to the original temple run 2! so far I'm liking the new changes!

B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is not your childhood fantasy. It may be a little startling at time but not a true horror. The story line is great and i cant wait to see the next episode

1604591625|4.0|My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I LOVED BEING ABLE TO SEE THE WHOLE SHOW AT ONE TIME.  IT WAS GREAT. I JUST GOT SEASON THREE.
B005LAII80|4.0|POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW.<br /><br />From the start of the movie, Dredd is shown to be an unrelenting force to be reckoned with, and appropriate for the post-apocalyptic world he exists in.  Karl Urban's portrayal of Dredd is perfect.  He is reserved with emotion but not with doling out justice.<br />Olivia Thirlby is a good fit as new Judge Cassandra Anderson - and her psychic abilities in the film help the two out more than once.  Lena Headey is perfect as Ma-Ma, the drug lord and main antagonist in this movie.  Ma-ma is cold and ruthless, and is a perfect adversary for the equally cold Judge Dredd.<br />The action is fast-paced and pretty-much relentless, and the various types of ammunition available for use by Dredd makes for great special effects, and painful deaths for his foes.<br />Though there is limited room for plot development in the timeframe in which the movie takes place, Dredd develops itself fully as a good, hard-hitting action flick that drives home the fact that Dredd is all-business and takes no prisoners.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best season yet!! I haven't even watched all of the episodes yet but it has already turned out to be the best season of all.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I tried to send a comment to them about this issue in my Visual Land device but was not able to send it. I bought this tablet because I wanted to use Kindle which was pre-installed.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is fun. Its a perfect time waster and geting to take care of your own horse is the best.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Entertaining with some good acting the setting is nice the sets are well done. Also the storyline keeps you coming back.
B005DZMODI|3.0|Wynton Marsalis and the other musicians deliver an awesome blend of jazz, blues and New Orleans style jazz. The clarinet player is a monster! Trombone player does a great job also. Clapton? Well...First let me say that I am a guitarist myself, have been playing for 45 years and can cover most styles. I play mostly blues and jazz myself and have been a big Clapton fan since I was kid. While I applaud Clapton for wanting to strtch out a bit he is a little out of his element. First off his tone is not right for most of the songs. While he thankfully has put the Strat down for this endevour (Strats are great guitars but not for this style) he should have also set up the amp to get a cleaner tone. The blues tone (warm overdrive) is just out of place for most of the tunes. It would have been nice to hear what he could have done with a clean jazz tone. While yes I understand that the album is entitled &#34;Play The Blues&#34;, a &#34;dirty&#34; sound is not always the best option specially when playing with jazz musicians who are playing wind instruments (trumpets, clarinets, etc.). Also his choice of scales/notes didn't fit the context often. The tune was screaming for a swinging guitar solo using say major pentatonic and Clapton just trods out the minor pentatonic which really didn't fit with the tune or with anything elase anybody else was doing with the song. The first tune &#34;Ice Cream&#34; is a great tune that allows the players to stretch out but once again Claptons tone is wrong for the tune. All of the tunes work well and on occasion the tone Clapton gets is appropriate, but most of the time not. Could have done without the remake of &#34;Layla&#34;. Surely they could have picked something else from the Clapton library to do. &#34;After Midnight&#34;? &#34;Bell Bottom Blues&#34; or even a more recent tune such as &#34;Change The World&#34;. Anything but &#34;Layla&#34;. How many times are we going to have to hear a new version of that song? So in the end I can only give this project three stars. Marsalis and the other musicians shine, Clapton should have stayed home.nly give this project three stars. Marsalis and the other musicians shine, Clapton should have stayed home.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great but emotional story. Once again Jodi Picoult leaves us guessing till the end. Great page turner and drew me in from first page. Not for the emotionally fragile.
B008966SLM|5.0|Robert Cray is one of my favorite guitarist and song writers. Highly recommend. Nice mix of tones since he also uses a hollowbody guitar on some of the tracks. Thanks Mr. Cray!

B003O86FMW|5.0|The whole series held me through out! So glad I hadn't seen the movie. This was actually a reading assignment for my daughter (Hunger Games), I love to read and picked it up and just couldn't put it down!! Thank you for a great and suspenseful adventure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game that amazon have ever used.this product has every quality. Its fun when they do the world tour you get to experience new board and people and enviorment
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I missed the show now I can watch anytime. Ordering was easy arrived early and the blue ray quality is wonderfull.
B00102F5WK|5.0|Very good suspenseful movie. I'd had never heard of this movie and I don't know why. It is well worth watching!!!!
B005LAII80|5.0|To start off, I am so perplexed as to why it performed so terribly at the box office! Of course it's an R rated movie and they obviously cannot make money like PG-13 action movies but come on! Firstly, Dredd is one of the best looking action movie in a long time; the \\"slo-mo\\" effects are quite beautiful and I love the dark gritty cinematography inside Peach Trees. The set design is amazing as well. The Mega Structures are incredible during the opening aerial shots. The cherry on top though, definitely, is Olivia Thirlby... Wait, what, oh, I got off track there.<br /><br />The story is decent. It definitely helps that Alex Garland is the writer. This is the fourth film he has written and it definitely continues his tried and true abilities to write in a post-apocalyptic setting with just a few characters to speak of. Dredd doesn't have very much dialogue, and it's a bit of a double edged sword. Obviously you want a likeable, relatable hero. I'd say he is likable enough. I'm glad they gave him a bit of humanity. He has a little sense of humor, which you can tell by an early scene involving an incendiary round. Judge Anderson rubs off on him through the movie. In the beginning he says something along the lines of a fail is a fail. By the end of the movie he sees the world in a slightly less black and white way when he passes judgement onto Judge Anderson. The other characters are drawn well enough. Judge Anderson is the psychic rookie who is very determined to become a judge. Ma-Ma is a vicious ex-prostitute who virtually runs Peach Trees. Overall I personally would give Dredd an enthusiastic 8/10 maybe an 8.5. I just wish there was a little more to the story.<br /><br />If you want a professional review of the Audio/Video quality of the blu-ray I would suggest you go to blu-ray.com they review almost every blu-ray release.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Poo horrible not to bad it's not the worst game in the world just kidding I love visiting different places like Rio for e·g
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing. Just perfect! I haven't found anything wrong with it!! And I love the zip line idea! Really greaaaat! (:
B005H29GSI|5.0|I've received several Angry Birds board games through the Vine program, to review, and I have to admit, with this one I just let my kids test it and report back. They are the experts on this, after all. My oldest reports that the pieces in this are a lot easier for her to fit together and work with than in some of the k'nex sets. And even the younger ones were able to get the slingshot to work. So they are all VERY happy with this set. They also mostly use it for pretend play, so it is good for that too, especially in conjunction with the other board game sets (providing more bird and pig characters). The pigs in this one do look a little weird--their faces are flat--but that's not a big deal. Overall, a fun game for young Angry Birds fans.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|this movie was written and directed extremely well and was great for all ages! i watched it again the next day since it was still in the 24hr rental period.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|A twisted plot with many good characters. A book that keeps you glued to the page. One that you would like to not end.

B003L77GRO|5.0|of course &#34;dexter&#34; is superb! and great service! would use this shipper again! i appreciate their  professionalism and quality control.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|great game. addicting. however it seems to have a bug where sometimes (about 10% of he time) when I try to use gems to continue a failed run... the game crashes. it's gotten to he point where I don't use them anymore. but that's the only flaw I've noticed in a near perfect game, and it may be specific to my device.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|I love this app! I can get all of my blog feeds and key word alerts all in one place, star them for later and share them. The only drawback that I have found is that I can't figure out how to add feeds from the web manually without going to the browser. All in all tho no complaints. I give it 4 stars.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|Well he is not a good writer but he can tell a good story and o boy dose he have sum.<br /><br />The story was really good and I like the side remark<br /><br />I didn't like that at the last quarter of the book the story goes back and foreword in time (a pain to keep track of the story line)<br /><br />But all and all a really good book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book, I think it's the best of all the three, and I<br />definitely recommend this book to everyone 12 and up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just wanted a simple calculator. Something for basic math calculations, nothing fancy. This has been perfect. Haven't had any issues running the App either. Good tool
B004SEUJK0|4.0|One of my favorite movies and it can be so hard to find!  So, Much better than the follow up movie.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Perfect doesn't exist, right? At least not in the world as we know it.  So rarely do I met out a five star review for a film, but The Sessions has earned every tip of five five-pointed stars.  In short, this film is great in every way that matters. Often times you'll view a movie that you know is made well but doesn't move you, leaves you curbside, and are well aware that you've just witnessed an expertly crafted piece of work but aren't vested in its characters. Not so with this film which from start to finish entetertains, educates, and illuminates and does so artfully.  Oh yes,I haven't told you what the film is about but all you have to do is look at the pictoral and read the first paragraph of any review to get that - iron lung, sex surrogate, therapy. Just go see the movie and you'll not be sorry. Hats off to John Hawkes, Helen Hunt, and the always wonderful William Macy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love all of Rick riordans books,especially any including Percy Jackson.  Can't wait until the next one comes out!  Five stars!
B007ZMD14I|5.0|Each song has it's own unique, but totally awesome sound, and each one Slash reminds us a guitar is for more than just background noise. Reminds me of the days old where lead guitar solos were just as important as the song lyrics. Love this album!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I thought this movie was hilarious.  At first I didn't think it was going to be any good and as movie went on, it was totally funny.<br />I recommend this comedy.  I gave it 4 stars because I liked it.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|I was told if you use this and get caught you can get in trouble so I wont be using this
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This movie was great.  It is my favorite of the Mission impossible movies.  I like the action and humor.  I watched this movie  2 times which is good because I don't like watching just ok movies twice.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|The downloadable sounds are great. I don't fall asleep with it but it is good while reading. Would buy again
B0044XRIMW|4.0|I have been watching this since I was a kid.  My parents raised us on wholesome movies.  Not many movies like this anymore so I enjoy watching it from time to time.  Very good movie to watch with the family.<br />Drawback is it's kind of long.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film & am glad that I purchased it. It has a wonderful message & is pretty true-to-life. I will view it again.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|First I was disappointed because it seemed nothing like the t.v. show.  I decided to give it a try and I enjoyed it as a comedy.  It was better than I expected it to be.  I would recommend this movie as a comedy, not compared to the hit t.v. show.
B003SHYVO8|4.0|This is a good film. It's inspirational. I only gave it four stars because the lead female dancer was obviously not as strong a dancer as the backup dancers. Otherwise all was well.
B007X709PE|5.0|I enjoy motorcycles and enjoy Moto GP.  Kind of bias.  I enjoyed the in depth story of the moto gp  races and back stories of the riders.  It was awesome to see this champions racing at over 200mph and good to see the biographies.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Not the best knife sharpener, but good for on the go. I do like the rod that folds out to sharpen the serenade side.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Good read. Confirms heaven. It is hard for a scientist to personally confirm and accept  things that are not concrete. The author did a good job.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I thought the way Gone Girl: A Novel was told was very confusing...It took a long time to get into the characters and see where it was all leading...the ending was very disappointing...
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is great and addictive, one of my favorite games on the market!  One flaw that I would like changed is that you have to be online to play the game.  Another flaw is how long everything takes when you get good at the game. However, dragonvale is so much fun, you can easily overlook these flaws, but they still get on your nerves when you get into the game.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I can see why The TIme Keeper was such a best seller. What a unique way to tell a story.
B0092ZEIN4|5.0|Well made little controller! Great quality and size..just right for portability. Was impressed with the buttons and cross hair d-pad.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good action and A possibility to build on the original plot of the series without bringing it all together it will give them a little wiggle room for another if they want to tie them all together.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I have not read the books, but found this movie to be wonderfully entertaining. It is an introspective movie, but that's what makes it so wonderful.  Tommy Lee Jones does not disappoint, and the mood of the movie is magical just like the bayou and New Orleans.  It makes me sad to think that the makers of this movie did not believe that it would do well at the theaters.  It's a sad statement of American audiences.  Great movie!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|good si fi Nice for a Saturday evening Good special effects.  lots of action and gore.  Not for the kiddies.  I am not sure why the psych girl just didn't get in the minds of Mom and wreak some phycosis.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Bought it because of one song, but I enjoyed the entire CD, I would suggest to anyone curious about Gotye.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever it is so addicting I can't take my eyes off the screen it is great for all ages my 2 year old sister even likes it great great whoever invented this game is a genius!!!!!!!!!!!
B004Y1USV2|4.0|My 18yo daughter, performing muso as she is, commented that this music sounds like the music heard in \\"The Young Ones\\" (off the wall Pommie comedy series, with a very young Rik Mayall,inter alia).<br />There's no joy in arguing with an 18yo woman, especially when she's right!<br /><br />The sharp, toppy Bombast Masters had gone out to make a Yes record for the times, eschewing kosmik bullescheisse leanings, avoiding very long meanderings, and the latter tendency to boring its listeners.<br /><br />Much of the Yes Oevre of the last 20 years has been clever but ultimately dull music, played with great panache, and indeed virtuosity, deepening our disappointments.Recurrently.<br /><br />Benoit David (Mystery) has an Anderson like voice, but not so elfin. Tougher, stronger.<br />The others all muck in for a jolly good time had by all.<br />Bright, cheerful music, generally avoiding being soppy.<br />Full of all our cherished Yes musical motifs. No great stand-outs...it works as  single entity, intended or not.<br /><br />Go on, enjoy it. I think the band forgot to be serious, and just enjoyed themselves. Not quite the hoped for return to form, but worthy indeed.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|three quarters of the way through he was still setting it up! Any action was still forthcoming. Rather boring compared to the Lion books
B005K17RU0|5.0|An excellent app for up to date information for weather conditions in your area.  I use it quite frequently to monitor the weather in my area.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a nice continuance of the Jack Ryan story line. Fast paced and thrilling for an all around good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So additive that before I could believe how much of copy it was of temple run but then my friend forced me to play it and I realized that it is nothing like temple run
