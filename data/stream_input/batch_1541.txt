0307951529|5.0|My family runs a seminar called \\"Raising Entrepreneurs\\" and this book fits right in.  The examples Chris uses are important because right off the bat he explains his criteria, giving credibility to an idea that may sound impossible.  For instance, he's talking about micro-startups all over the world, that don't require big investment money behind them (this is great news!)  They range in revenue from 50K up - many are sub 100K businesses, but the reader can see the potential as he goes along.  The average person can do something more than sit in a cube or work in a plant all day.  But here comes the CAUTION - this book should be providing inspiration for young people, and as our seminar title suggests, we recommend junior high and high-school aged kids get involved, and this book provides some necessary catalyst.  I wish Chris had left out a hand-full of words and examples in chapters 8 and 9.  While kids hear much worse in school, as a parent, I am not interested in giving my kids books that contain sexual innuendo or four letter words.  There are only a few in here, but it seem unnecessary and inappropriate for me to endorse this with a younger audience.  I did buy copies for several of my children but had to come back with the black marker to feel like a responsible parent.<br /><br />One more note - the reviews that call for more prescriptive writing...This book provides the vision, but perhaps Chris needs to come back with a second volume on steps people can take to get started.  The number one question I get is, \\"How exactly do I start my business from nothing?\\"  The second is, \\"How do I take it from tiny to big enough to support a family?\\"  Perhaps I will write this book if he doesn't.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is loaded with a bunch of levels so you will never get bored. the levels get progressively harder so if you think it is easy, it only gets harder.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is just an amazing story that never lost my interest. I will be looking for the next books from this author. Although I was concerned this was just the first book published(I like to wait for the series to be completed), the first book stands on its own very well. This is nothing less than a 5 star book.
B0086700CM|5.0|how could this game get anything less than 4 stars? this version of temple run is the same version as the ipod one. nothing new or different. it is very addicting and has endless replayability. the only thing is that for the kindle fire, the coins sound different. but that is easily overlookable.
B005EHILV4|5.0|Works great, I used it so I can have simultaneous audio inputs from two devices. 1) AirPort express mini jack audio out 2) 42\\" TV Audio out.  I got the idea after doing some google searching for solutions.  My first attempt was to use a standard Y slitter/joiner but it resulted in only hearing one of the two devices.  I now have my amplified speakers on 24/7 and music or tv hassle free ready
B000QCQ9O8|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  This wasn't a bad novel by any means.  It just wasn't what I was expecting.  And I guess after reading the shining reviews about this being one of the best novels of our time...well, it was somewhat of a letdown.  It read like an English classic (is that why my brain set this story in Mr. Rochester's house?), and the war scenes were vividly descriptive.  This author indeed has control of the language and knows how to weave a tale.  I guess it may have been how the story worked itself out in the end.  Maybe this review may have been more glowing if it had ended differently (there I go basing a novel on the ending again). Probably.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|during gameplay there isn't an option to scroll or zoom, making it almost unplayable.  good premise, but the mechanics missing ruined it for me.
0345495004|4.0|I read this off the the heels of The Paris Wife, so the universe must be telling me I need to hear the stories from the woman's perspective.  I really have had no basic knowledge of FLW except for seeing his architecture around town, and to tell you the truth, had no idea he had such a dramatic personal life.  I really enjoyed \\"learning\\" about Wright through the eyes of Mamah, who was entirely engaging and likable.  Since I hadn't known any personal history coming into this, I have to say, the conclusion really threw me, and saddened me in that process.  This lady was alive, with thoughts and dreams and love, and I think that this novel really does her great justice.
B00846REIS|2.0|I thought this book was way too similar to Fifty Shades.  The writing was a definite step up but there wasn't any originality to it. Eva's character was like a nagging drama filled teenager who just didn't get it. She annoyed me at every turn and Gideon was a Christian Grey hands down. The use of safe words, the possessiveness, having a room for her at his home, the dom sub thing, him being a billionaire in his mid twenties and owning every spot in NY, family issues, stalking her like Christian stalked Ana it was just too much.  Way too much happened in just 2 weeks of their relationship.  I was just annoyed by the entire book.
B004LROUW2|4.0|This book was my JOB for practically two weeks straight.  Most of the time I had NO IDEA what was going on or where it was going.  I'm glad I hung on for the ride though, because about half way through things start to come together.  I read the last 20% in one 8 hour sitting (Yes it took me 8 hours to read 20% of this tome), but by that point, I really couldn't put it down.  As I became more attached to these characters, the plot unwound very slowly and with just enough suspense to keep me hanging on for more.  It's one of those books that keeps you wondering and thinking far after you finish the last page...although, if I start thinking TOO hard about it, I fear my brain may explode.  Definitely glad I picked this one up!
B000295SH4|5.0|This UK edition sold here was a bigger success in England, peaking at No. 6 and earning Summer a Gold record.<br /><br />While I have Endless Summer and Gold, The Journey still has it's attractions for me.<br /><br />1) Songs excluded from the US print but are here because they were not released Stateside or were bigger hits in the UK.<br /><br />I never knew Summer had recorded a song for the movie called The Deep. Down Deep Inside is a great track with a lush orchestra.<br /><br />The other is Rumour Has It - very innovative and experimental in terms of musical arrangements.<br /><br />2) Don't sniff at the bonus disc. Although it has only eight songs, the run time is over 70 minutes.<br /><br />The original 12\\" of Love To Love You Baby features lots of added instrumental parts plus more ecstaric moaning. Over 16 minutes.<br /><br />Wait, there's more. Utterly fabulous original 12\\" of Hot Stuff, On The Radio and I really like No More Tears (Enough Is Enough). The 12\\" puts in a lot more vocal parts making it far more interesting than the standard version.<br /><br />Melody Of Love (Wanna Be Loved) is given  a great twist by Morales' Classic Club Mix.<br /><br />In addition, a fantastic Patrick Cowley mix of I Feel Love, plus a new song That's The Way.<br /><br />I would liked that they put in the 12\\" of Last Dance.<br /><br />Heaven Knows is a new discovery for me, both on this and Gold. Summer is practically bursting with joy and you can hear it!<br /><br />The American edition features a different track list on both discs. Compare it on Amazon. The bonus CD is worth checking out. There are 12\\" and remixes of This Time I Know It's For Real, You're So Beautiful, Dream-A-Lot's Theme ( I Will Live For Love) and a shorter 12\\" of I Feel Love. The bonus disc is not reflected on the back cover or in the booklet. Until the shop staff opened the case to show me the bonus disc, I thought it was a single disc version. The chart positions listed were all pop. Some songs likeLove Is In Control and State Of Independence, only the R&B positions were listed. Very puzzling.<br /><br />Overall, The UK Journey skews more towards 70s Donna with a few 80s hits thrown in - She Works Hard For The Money, Dinner With Gershwin and Love Is In Control (Finger On The Trigger). The US Journey is more a condensation of the 2 disc Gold. But I can tell you the bonus discs for both versions alone is worth more than the asking price. Uh huh, yeah.<br /><br />I'm having a blast with this and I'm sure Donna is having a ball in the sky!

B00006FDCJ|5.0|For a long time, I was what many would consider the average moviegoer. I wasted my money crappy movies often, just because of a star that I liked, or a premise that seemed interesting. As much as I hate to admit it, I did not like Westerns for the life of me. I saw Appaloosa when it came out in theatres, and ironically liked it, albeit only a little. I then saw 3:10 To Yuma, and what do you know, I loved it. Still do. Finally, there came a point where I had to ask myself what my problem was, why I refused to give other Westerns a chance. I eventually blind bought the DVD and decided to watch, not only one of the classic films collecting dust on my shelf, but one of the greatest Westerns ever made. Unforgiven is very well done. Certainly deserving of the recognition it has received over the years. I'm actually glad that this movie won Best Picture. Clint Eastwood is obviously well known for his portrayal of cowboys back when Westerns owned the air waves. I love how he came back in the early 90's to show them he hadn't lost his touch with a six shooter, or Schofield rifle, or shotgun, etc. He was perfect, and played the role exactly as I would expect. But his character went through a change that I was not expecting.<br /><br />The movie progresses along at a slow pace, and calmly inches its way toward the thrilling conclusion. Throughout the film we hear repeatedly how much of a badass Bill Munny was back in his heyday. There wasn't much to show for it. When we first meet him he's falling all over his pigs. Later on down the line he gets a fever from a small beating and is asleep for three days. I started to think to myself that this guy needed to take his old behind back home before he got too deep into trouble. He was not in any shape to try to kill anyone. Slowly, but surely we meet the man. I'll leave it at that because it's nearly impossible to say more without spoiling anything. I'll just say that Clint's performance is enough to sit through this one, even without the fantastic supporting cast and subtle writing. Morgan Freeman was great as well. He played Bill's longtime friend and partner in crime, Ned. When a young man suddenly shows up on Bill's ranch asking him to help kill a couple of bad men for a bounty, Ned's place is the first stop Bill makes. Together Bill and Ned accompany the young man on this hit. I might as well call it a hit, instead of sugar coating it. Bill and Ned are assassins, hitmen. So they aren't very good men themselves. The young man, called \\"The Schofield Kid\\", is played by Jaimz Woolvett (a relatively unknown...to me anyway). He does great too.<br /><br />The whole cast is really good. Gene Hackamn plays a real jerk of a town sheriff, named Little Bill, and Richard Harris has a short, but meaningful role as English Bob. I should also mention that the whores were well played as well. I feel bad calling them that, but that's what everyone else in the movie called them. I really liked this cast. Clint Eastwood is a hell of a director. The shots are really nice to look at. This isn't his most beautifully shot film, but this cinematography will impress nonetheless. If Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy is even a fraction as good as Unforgiven, I cannot wait. I can rest assured that that was a worthwhile purchase, even for a non-Western fan like myself. I really look forward to seeing many more films in this genre hence forth. If you're like I was, and doubt you'll be interested in movies like this one, stop it. Just give Unforgiven a chance and see for yourself. I highly recommend this movie.ut the fantastic supporting cast and subtle writing. Morgan Freeman was great as well.

B003B02OOG|4.0|I have liked most of John Gresham's novels.  I found this collection of short stories to be very entertaining. \\"The Blood Drive\\" was great!  I think I knew these fellows a number of years ago.  If you want a good read for a trip or a time at the beach, you won't be disappointed with this volume.
B000006IUQ|5.0|This is a great movie that never got much press. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin (suprisingly) work great together. Some have said that the plot and the ending are predictable and that may be partially true,but every minute is worth watching.

0553801503|2.0|OK, why the hell am I bothering to write a review, albiet brief, where I doubt I'll be saying anything revelatory? Because I'm annoyed enough to invest the time writing this, despite my lack of originality.<br /><br />Martin includes an epilogue where he points out that, because he had a bad case of diarrhea of the pen, he wrote too much stuff for one book. So in fact, what we have here is Part One where only a select few of the character's storylines are developed, and then we will need to read Part Two in Book Five, where we reset the chronological timeline back to the end of Book Three, and then pick up with the other characters, when hopefully, by the end of Book 5, the timeline will once again become one. (You got all that because I now have a headache).<br />Martin suggests that it was better to do it this way rather than have this book cover all of the characters as was the tradition in the magnificent first three volumes. Unfortunately, he decided to choose many uninteresting and/or new POV characters in this book. Add to this the weighty use of the descriptive narrative and you have one of the most tedious reads you will ever encounter. I thought no one could top the turgid middle books of Jordan's Wheel of Time but Martin managed to wear the crown of endless wordspinning quite comfortably. If he had simply parcelled out these additional POV's among the well established characters, and tightened up on the writing, he could have achieved a book which would at least be a more enjoyable read, even if the story would not have advanced as far as this one. The only positive of this volume is that you will learn quite early on, how to skim off the literary fat and breeze through many many chapters, only pausing long enough to catch the important meaty bits that lay within.<br /><br />I have to recommend the book of course if you are into reading the series, as there are a few good moments of storyline wheat among the chaff, and I want to give Martin a mulligan because of his fine work in the first three books.  Let's all hope however that this was a hiccup in the series and is not an ill portent of things to come.
030758836X|4.0|Some readers might think GONE GIRL is a fictional version of a \\"48 Hours\\" episode. It certainly does sound that way at times.<br /><br />One difference is that the novel is somewhat topical. The two main characters, Nick and Amy Dunne run afoul of the Great Recession. At the beginning of the book both are writers living the great life in New York City. But then Nick loses his job working at a magazine and Amy follows suit shortly afterwards. She was working, somewhat beneath herself, as a personality quiz writer for magazines like COSMOPOLITAN.<br /><br />They're not really in trouble yet, unless you count Nick's depression. They're not hurting financially since Amy is an heiress. Her affectionate parents wrote a series of children's books staring a barely disguised version of their daughter entitled, AMAZING AMY, which explains a lot.<br /><br />Then Nick's mother is stricken with cancer, and Nick decides to move back to Missouri to be with her; he and his twin sister, Margot, borrow money from Amy's trust fund to buy a bar. Amy is outwardly cheerful but is a seething volcano inside. This isn't the life she pictured for herself; she wants her ideal life back, and she wants her old husband back.<br /><br />Nick is a guy's guy; he has trouble remembering anniversaries and birthdays, Valentine's day, whatever. Amy claims she doesn't want to be one of those Dumb Doras who gets her undies in a bundle when her husband doesn't conform to wifely expectations. Their fifth anniversary is about to arrive and Nick still hasn't figured out what to get her. We all know twenty-fifth is silver and fiftieth is gold. Some might even know that first is paper, but who knows the fifth is wood. Amy likes to put Nick through the ringer with little scavenger hunts during their anniversaries. Nick hates them because he can rarely understand what she's hinting at. Nick's sister, whom he calls \\"Go\\", isn't very helpful. She suggests he \\"Go home (blank) her brains out, then smack her with your (blank) and scream, `There's some wood for you, (blank). \\"Go\\" is the most unique character in the book but considering the seriousness of what's happening there's not a whole lot for her to do.<br /><br />The similarity to \\"48 Hours\\" occurs when Amy disappears. The door is open, the cat is sitting on the doorstep, too stupid to run away, a dress is on the ironing board upstairs and the iron is still on, but Amy is missing. Did a stranger kidnap Amy? Did she run away? Did her husband kill her? The husband is usually the principal suspect and as time goes by this case isn't any different. Nancy Grace even makes an appearance as a fictional character, and she's not a Nick fan. All Nick has to prove his innocence is Amy's scavenger hunt, and he follows it religiously. It's a lot easier than it usually is.<br /><br />We also have Amy's journal to help us learn what she was thinking before she left. Author Gillian Flynn alternates between the two characters chapter wise. About half way through, we get a serious twist which makes Nick look even more guilty.<br /><br />The ending is a bit, okay a lot, disappointing, because the culprit doesn't get his/her comeuppance and Flynn leaves us hanging. In one respect it's kind of intriguing because you can predict what's going to happen if you try hard enough. One of the characters has already told us.(blank) and scream, `There's some wood for you, (blank). \\"Go\\" is the most unique character in the book but considering the seriousness of what's happening there's not a whole lot for her to do.<br /><br />The similarity to \\"48 Hours\\" occurs when Amy disappears.

B007BRJYF2|3.0|This is based on the \\"Alice in Wonderland \\" story.  I happen to love that one, so I liked the story.  However, if you're not an avid fan of Alice you probably will think the story is cheesy.<br /><br />The hidden objects part of the game isn't too bad but it does get ridiculous at times, like when you have to find 93 white roses.  Yes, 93!<br /><br />You have to solve a 6 piece puzzle which is a cream and black drawing that looks like a page from the book.  You switch and rotate pieces to get the picture.  Not too bad,  but it is between EVERY major screen,  so you have to do this 15 times or so in the game.  Boring.<br /><br />I love anuman games, but clearly was either rushed or one of their earlier games.<br /><br />Unless you're an Alice fan, skip this one.  But for 99¢ it is good if want a fairly quick game.

B000002GN0|5.0|Let's face it---few acts have had such an international impact as ABBA.  Who else could better epitomize the \\"Smiley Face/Have a Nice Day\\" of the seventies than these amazing hitmakers?  ABBA had great textured harmonies, the infectious and brilliant melodies of Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus and of course Agnetha and Frida.  And no group could be so eclectic and do it so well!<br />VOULEZ VOUS is a perfect example of their musical prowess.  Along with the five hit singles, the remaining tracks are equally catchy!ABBA's music is timeless and irresistible!
0525478817|5.0|You told me this was a great read, but I ignored you, thinking John Green was just another author of Sad Teenager Stories.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stories is the story of a sixteen-year-old girl, Hazel, who has been dying of cancer for the last three years. Her mother forces her to get up out of bed and socialize, and, in this quest to help her shake off depression, she takes her to a Cancer Support Group.<br /><br />And there Hazel meets the oh-so-handsome Augustus Waters. He, too, has been fighting cancer, with one of his legs lost in his battle.<br />Hazel and Augustus talk books which leads them off on a wild trip to meet the world's worst behaved author, all the way in the Netherlands.<br /><br />I was right, too, though; this book is a Sad Teenager Story. But, oddly, it is also a Happy Teenager Story, and that mix, plus the wonderful characters of Hazel and Augustus and, yes, even the Awful Author, you will want to meet make it a must-read.

B000RO9VJK|1.0|This is my first book review I ever write. But I felt compelled to do it.<br />Occasionally we have all been misled by overrated book-reviews. \\"Having been misled\\" for this book is however an extreme understatement. This book was exceptional. Exceptionally, almost insultingly bad.<br /><br />Let's face it, usually, whenever a book is very bad, it's rare, but it happens. Then, one bites the bullet and rather than wasting any additional time we try to forget about it as quickly as possible and move on.<br /><br />But this book, the \\" e-myth revisited\\" is without no doubt the most appaling, most awful and most annoying pice of \\" whatever this is\\" written that I have come accross in my 22 years of business career.<br /><br />The grotesquely dismal style is perfectly characterized by awful, annoying, appaling. I may add it's abyssal and ugly.<br />Why this is possible, how is it possible that this \\" thing\\" is around at the first place.<br /><br />It is actually almost a farce, you skip and jump entire paragraphs and pages just to get out of this nightmare as quickly as you can.<br />The few ideas of valuable common sense could stick on 10 pages but the nightmare continues over 250 pages, arrrggghhhh!<br />What an embarassing waste of time and money.<br />In all good faith, where do all these people (450 people by mid-july 2012 !!!) come from who gave 4 or even 5 stars ratings?<br />Why so much complacency?<br />Speechless!
B00884GR0W|5.0|excellent game!  and im really glad to see developers sticking up for themselves for once.  honestly, 5 dollars is a steal for how much effort was put into block story.  no crazy permissions, no IAPs, just a great game with hundreds of hours of gameplay. keep it up guys, your game will break 4 stars once all the children have had their say and more people actually play.

0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games book one is the best EVER because it contains hope, wishful thinking, love, action, emotions (like horror and excitement) and many other things that get your heart racing. Personally, I think the book is better than the movie. There are villains, yes, but not like you would expect. After every chapter, this book leaves you hanging off the edge of cliff, but in a good way. Suzanne Collins KNOWS how to go into extreme detail without making it boring, so that makes this book a good one for everyone about ten and up, If the parent allows their daughter/son to read it. While reading this book, you can feel the pizzaz and see the picture you would expect out of a book THIS many people have read.

But alas - what a disappointment !!!<br />Martin seems to have to written this book for only one apparent reason - revenue; he deliberately skirts progressing the real story, instead focusing on side-stories & lesser characters. Tyrion & Daenerys are NOT EVEN mentioned. Arya, Sansa, Catelyn, Jon's stories hardly develop with non-nonsensical side plots engulfing them.<br />The author even blatantly admits avoiding the real story in the end with the excuse that \\"he did not to avoid the story of the other lesser important people\\".<br />As a reader though, it left us frustrated - reading the book for over a month it felt a tremendous waste of time.<br /><br />We are in two minds to pick up book 5.<br /><br />In sum our advise - skip this book completely; you will not have missed the main story a bit....

0062197258|4.0|This intense psychological thriller kept me flipping pages, racing to the gripping finale late into the night! Despite its riveting nature, this impressive debut novel is not completely flawless but certainly intriguing. Catherine made for a very strong narrator - in fact, she so firmly convinced me that it seemed a little difficult to believe that anyone at all would doubt her at all, let alone those close to her so completely!  It would have been nice for a more detailed physical description of Catherine, though, considering the way her appearance affected those around her. Catherine's mental conditions of OCD and PTSD were handled very well and just oozed of solid research. Everything about the novel had a genuine, authentic quality to it.<br /><br />Perhaps the only seemingly in-authentic part of the book dealt with Catherine's actions in the interim stages in the two timelines. The book is quite reminiscent of that Julia Roberts film, [[ASIN:B00009WVSL Sleeping With the Enemy]] in many ways, but Catherine's \\"escape\\" surprised me in the weakness of the measures she took to feel safe. While her illness took the majority of the precautions, and she did move house, she never left the country (and she showed earlier that she was comfortable doing this), nor did she even so much as change the spelling of her first name to cause some doubt that it was the same Catherine Bailey. She did not even dye her hair or anything! But, I suppose there would not have been a story had she been more proactive in protecting herself! And while some of the plot elements were predictable, the level of tension and atmosphere definitely kept me anxious to see definitively where the story would go.<br /><br />As for Lee's character, it would have been nice to have a bit more in the line of his motivations. He quickly became the perfect villain, but not very many of the questions raised about him ever were resolved to my satisfaction. This reinforced Catherine's P.O.V. and general terror, but overall made the villain a bit too boogeyman-ish for me. Some of his actions, especially toward the end of the novel, were particularly mysterious (was the fate of the two women in London intentional?? Is he that controlled - or just that sloppy??)<br /><br />But the largest problem that I had with the book was the layout and structure. The two timelines, of 2003-04 and 2007-08, that ran parallel throughout the novel switched back and forth so rapidly, that it chopped the flow of the book up a bit too much - especially in the beginning of the novel. And, once you became absorbed in it, it was easy to miss the headline marking the time change and causing a great deal of confusion. I hope that newer additions will address these headlines, and make them a bit more obvious to avoid readers being jerked out of the book in utter confusion. That is obviously, not the fault of the author, and I must say, this is certainly a strong debut and I plan on keeping an eye out for new books from her in the future!but overall made the villain a bit too boogeyman-ish for me.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Some of the games take quite a few tries because the controls can be tricky, but if they were all super easy it wouldn't be challenging and fun to finally beat the target score.  I enjoy the gamed to fill in a few minutes here and there.  Good variety.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|i just dont understand. Jaycee went through 18 years living in her own horror movie and people are giving the book 1 star becuase of the grammar!? really? she should not even have to tell anyone bout this expierience but she did. she didnt go to school for 18 years and you expect her to be a suzanne collins or a judy blume? this was the greatest book i as a book worm have ever read. i gave it a 4 because i sobbed after i finished reading it thinking &#34;he made her do that to him!? how could someone do that for pleasure?!&#34; of course this is coming from a 12 yer olds point of veiw. i admire her for exepting what was happening so noone else would get hurt and afterward not hating them. i cant imagine not hating someone doing that to you, becuase i hte him now ndim not een thevictim. if you have a heart, read this book then put yourself in her position. good luck

B006FO3ERQ|1.0|A FEW EXCERPTS TO CONSIDER<br /><br />\\"We drove up third street, along the river, past where Berner and I walked and fed the ducks. The sky had come unsettled again and windy, moving smells around. Flat, purple bottomed clouds slid up of the south. Whitecaps danced on the river surface and gulls soared in the damp breeze. There'd be a thunderstorm. It'd been trying to all day. Fall was starting - our mother had been right.\\"<br /><br />READER: Do you associate thunderstorms with Fall? And,of course,knowing that Fall follows Summer is not special.<br /><br />\\"A change in the weather had occurred overnight. The house was now cool and breezy, and the front and back doors were left open. Pale clouds you could see through the kitchen window hurried over from the west, and the light had turned a yellow green. The curtains billow, and the elms in our yard in the park across the street sawed back and forth as if rain was coming. Our pile of cast-off clothes lay on the back porch awaiting the St. Vincent de Paul truck. Inside the house seemed fresh and almost calm in spite of the breezes. It felt like a morning in which something significant was expected in the afternoon.\\"<br /><br />READER: Are you to be riveted, waiting for something \\"significant\\" to happen? Cool breezes and clothes laying on the porch are not alarming things.<br /><br />\\"Under the wind whipped trees, my mother looked up through the arch of moving limbs and observed that the air had a seam of cold in it now (which I couldn't feel). She was sorry about it.\\"<br /><br />READER: Never saw a \\"cold seam\\" in the sky, and why would she be sorry about it.<br /><br />\\"The only thing I was conscious of was a sensation and I couldn't have described it - of movement taking place around me. Nothing was visible at the surface of life, and it was the surface of life that I knew about. The children in families have the sensation of movement. It can signify something is taking care of them, that things are being invisibly looked after, and nothing bad is likely to happen. Or it can mean something else.\\"<br /><br />READER: Movement in the world is not a startling concept. And does he understand only the surface?

But since you don't know my friend Matt and probably shouldn't take advise second hand from someone you don't know, just look and see that this book has over 1000 5 star reviews. If you like the works of Philip K Dick, Ray Bradbury, or George Orwell do yourself a favor and pick it up.

0061146307|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! im 14 and i've read this series 9 times. i love the kids and even the villians. Lemony Snicket is a wizard with a pen for a wand; these books are absoletely brilliant! the author has made me laugh out loud and practically rolling on the floor with laughter at his delightfully depressing bouts of such knowledge that is so true it's amazing no one's noticed it before. he talks about things so nonchalantly that the truth behind his words are made hilarious ex: \\"if you are alergic to a thing, it is best not to put that thing in your mouth, particularily if that thing is cats\\" (wide window 102) i LOVE these books. i can practically recite them from memory. anyone who dopesn't read these books is spiralling closer to the end of their life, and without Lemony snicket, your death will be laughless and depressing. (\\"if you live each day as though it was your last, eventually you will be right,\\" Horse radish, LS)<br /><br />i think that thsi series isn't scary for youngsters at all. the only thing i would be converned about wuld be comprehension and some of the villans are rather scary... like the hook handed man or the one who looks like niether a man nor a woman... other than that, iv had five year old i've babysat that have cracked up over page one of the bad beginning<br /><br />READ IT OR ELSE:)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible App.  I used to use a different one exclusively until I found this one.  What is great about it is that there are many multiple versions available with some downloadable to your device.  Some versions are even have narrated so you can have then read to you while you drive, work, or exercise.  Of course it has the other features like highlight and notes which are useful, too.  It does everything I need and it is all in one place.  I like it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is amazing!  Reading it once is not enough.  A true love story for those who don't like mushy romance novels.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the second book of the Fifty trilogy, and it just gets better and better. What we have here is a love story, with a little kinky sex thrown in, but these books are fabulously written and contain everything one wants in a good read; love, commitment, struggling relationships, humor, mystery, over the top drama, intrigue, attempted murder, sex in a variety of forms that still allows the reader to use his or her imagination,etc. If you are buying the book just for the sex, you'll be disappointed because the second book tames down a bit - it's still racy,but it goes more into the characters building emotional relationships. A great read.
B00784637K|4.0|I have read various reviews that are split on this record. I love it! It's amazing to me that Van Halen could muster up this type of effort this late in the game. Many of the songs (music wise) are rewrites from tunes they had in the mid seventies. People have complained about this. Who cares? The tunes are great and Roth really shines in the lyrics department. One underrated factor here is Wolfie: He's a monster on this album and really grooves throughout.
B007X4HPIG|4.0|Sounds like the Jesus and Mary Chain recording in a Tesla Factory. The songs include drums, I think? though they sound like they were recorded within Buckingham Palace on some cuts, you have to sift through the electro-feedback mire to track them. Sonic fans, let your ears bleed.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I loved this soundtrack! Of course it's not the original artists singing so it's not going to be the same. However, I think the actors did a great job! It's fun and brings back lots of memories for me. So if you don't like musicals, you won't like this album. If you loved the movie, you'll love this soundtrack!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I got this when it was free and now that I have it I can honestly say that I would pay for it.  It's so simple a concept but it is so fun.  The tutorial is excellent and really made it clear how to play the game.  I have gotten through about half the levels, which means I am just in the \\"normal\\" difficulty level.  I look forward to the continued challenges as I proceed through the levels.  Truthfully this is the first \\"nonogram\\" game I have tried.  (I think that is what they call it.)  Because of this game app I went online to try to play something similar to it on my computer and the few that I tried leave so much to be desired compared to this one.  The developer realy did a good job with the interface.  The only complaint there is that on the harder levels sometimes it is hard to get the perfect balance between the size of the boxes without losing sight of the big picture, including the numeric indicators along the sides.  Honestly I think this is my favorite game on my Android right now.  If you like sudoku without the commitment then this is for you.  It is similar but not quite so frustrating.  If you have the chance, you should give it a chance.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I overlooked the writing errors and I'm not going to be a grammar nazi (geez, those people are the worse!) so I'll move on.<br /><br />For Abby, she needed a reality check seriously. Some back bone of hers would've been nice but I didn't hate her. I was bothered with the fact she kept stringing Travis, especially Parker, along...unconvincingly even if she tried to be nice. (Wait, maybe she stringed Travis more so than Parker....hm, oh whatever.) When she left Travis the first time, I rooted for her only to find out that she couldn't keep away. Shrug. I've been depressed before over stupid boys and it was so pathetic of me, I'd given myself a negative review if I was reading (watching?) those moments of my life. Just pathetic. Anyway, every time Abby grew a back bone, it disappeared when thinking of Travis. COME ON ABBY! KEEP ONE BACKBONE AT LEAST! ):<br /><br />For Travis, as much as I really liked the guy, I wish he threw some sense into himself but more so to Abby. I understand he's sooooooo in love (or lust?) with her and what girl wouldn't want to see the sensitive side of a sexy guy? My point is, Travis was practically throwing himself at her! COME ON TRAVIS! I mean, I was swooning for Travis but I really wanted to knock some sense into that guy. Dude, you're losing it.<br /><br />This is all nothing more than just an opinion!<br /><br />I admit the main characters' relationship was, without a doubt, disastrous but I have an open mind (which does not mean I'm misguided or I'm down with violence and abuse) so I welcomed the FICTION thought. (Some reviewers on here are so negative, judging people who gave this book a positive review thinking we condone such violent behaviors or we're some Twilight-loving teeny boppers. Get a grip. Judge the book and not the people giving good reviews about it! Not everyone is going to have the same likes and dislikes so why are you judging them for their preferences?) Moving on again...<br /><br />I was hesitant about posting this review after reading some negative comments but I figured you negative comments are inevitable. LOVE YOU ALL THOUGH!s review after reading some negative comments but I figured you negative comments are inevitable. LOVE YOU ALL THOUGH!
B0065FFMR0|5.0|Although I have only just begun watching this series, I am really enjoying it. The first episode was a bit confusing, but after episode two I began understanding the underlying theme and sub plots. As a horror/suspense fan I have really been looking for a series like this one for a long time, not since Stephen King's \\"Kingdom Hospital\\" has a series gotten my attention the way this one has. It's not for those who have difficulty reading between the lines and filling in gaps where the action is alluded to but not actually shown. About the only negative thing I can say about this show is that the creators have \\"borrowed\\" a lot from other stories and movies. Examples being the characters of the twins (The Shining),The housekeeper (The Others),The home invaders in episode three (The Strangers) etc. But overall the cast is very strong and I absolutely LOVE Jessica Lange. The cinematography is great the music is just funky enough, and the story is solid. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good suspenseful drama
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I am half way through this book.  I find it just up a scale from a Mills and Boon.  Same story line, nice girl meets dark and mysterious man.....  More sex, thats the only difference.  I fail to see how this got to be a number one.

B0058YPG1G|3.0|I love this show and have yet to see an episode that I didn't like. I have watched every episode and don't typically use subtitles but the last 5 or 6 episodes of season 4 have a lot of spanish but no subtitles. I purchased this season from ebay at a much cheaper price than the $30 that amazon has it listed for because it wasn't on netflix and season 5 was about to begin and I wanted to get caught up and watch every episode in order. This season is now on netflix WITH SUBTITLES! This is a great show but I'm not rating the show because overal this show is a 5 star show but unless you speak spanish you don't get all of the information needed to follow the show.<br />  For instance, in episode 10 Gus, Mike, and Jesse are in Mexico speaking with the drug cartel and Gus is speaking with the kingpen of the cartel who informs Gus that he has crossed the line. It is implied from this that the cartel plans to kill Gus and they have already informed him that Jesse belongs to the cartel now and is going to have to stay in cook. The fact that the cartel was planning to kill Gus is a big deal because (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Gus knows their plan and in turn poisons the men from the cartel while poisoning himself at the same time, then goes to the restroom and vomits the poison out before it can take full effect and kill him.<br />  I say the above because without the subtitles you would be unaware of the fact that the cartel was plotting to kill Gus and that Gus knew this and had to kill the cartel first before he and his men were killed.<br />  I say save yourself the money and watch this on netflix with the subtitles to get the full story of what is going on when the cartel and Gus meet and speak in spanish. Great show but should have spent the extra money on the product to put subtitles in.

B005LAIGQ4|4.0|Putting aside Greenpeace and political views, this was a good movie that adults can watch together with their children.  Sex and profanity is non-existent.  The story lacks slightly in parts, however overall if you are looking for clean entertainment for the evening, you can't go wrong with this one. There are several places where discussions could be opened up for families to impress upon their children redeeming values.<br /><br />I liked the fact that this was based on a true event, and while I was more than old enough at the time of the actual occurance, I had actually never heard of this story before.  This made the story all the more interesting for me as I was able to watch it unfold for the first time.<br /><br />There are quite a few well known actors/actresses in this movie, but the native Inuit's really steal the show.  The grandfather/grandson team was excellent as were the main male/female reporters.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />Those of you with sensitive children who might be saddened by the death of the baby whale should take note that only the parent whales survive the situation.

The sights and sounds of the glory days of F-1. Life and death. Could never be made now even with CGI. This was real cars, tracks and weather. The extras are worth the price of the DVD.

0684135051|5.0|I learned to knit with the [[ASIN:B0054FX07Q Teen Knitting Club: Chill Out and Knit [Spiral-bound]]] book.<br /><br />I made garter stitch scarves.  I made stockinette stitch scarves.  My fear of double pointed needles drove me to crochet.  When crochet sweaters turned out too bulky to wear, I went back to knitting, this time on circular needles.<br />All this over the course of seven years.  Seven years in which I was unable to make sweaters, hats or socks.  What a waste.<br /><br />All of that changed with my first Elizabeth Zimmermann (EZ) book.  Her instructions are simple, well thought out, comprehensive, and let me tell you, you will LEARN from her books.<br /><br />I made my first seamless yoke sweater, using the yarn I bought on sale at Michael's.  I am attaching a picture to my review of this book because it is probably too shameless to post a link to my blog here.  In any case, you can really see how my knitting improved after buying EZ's books.  She teaches you how to make sweaters using the yarn you purchased (not some expensive recommended yarn in a printed pattern) to your exact body measurements.  Yes, it will fit when you are done.  You will be amazed when what you have made is attractive and wearable and loved by the recipient.<br /><br />I have made wristlets (thumb gussets!), socks, sweaters, shawls, baby jackets, all with EZ's help.  I promise you that this book WILL change your life for the better.  You will honestly wonder what took you so long.<br /><br />If you buy one knitting book, buy [[ASIN:0761128182 Stitch 'N Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook]].  If you buy two, this has to be your second one.  You could live your whole life happily knitting from those two books.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I've Got Your Number was, as all Kinsella novels are, very cute and entertaining. Of course it was completely predictable as it followed the same basic story map of the Shopaholic series and some of her other novels. I think if I had heard that first, I might have skipped it, but I wouldn't say having read it was a total waste of my time.
1439156816|5.0|I am not a Stephen King fan, not because he is not good at his craft, he is, but because I don't read the type of things he writes. That said, I have to say that this book was one of the top two most useful books on writing I have read, and I've read plenty. His direct, down-to-earth style gets right to the heart of the matter, and his generous and candid sharing of his personal experiences results in a rich account of what writing is to him and what it can be to others. I like that he issues no ultimatums but still puts forth his thoughts with strength and authority. It is just a wonderfully direct and wise conglomerations of advice and counsel. I felt his sense of sharing. He didn't have to write this book. He could have written another of his big hit crazy wonderful off-the-wall stories, but he shared himself instead. Thanks you, Stephen. You have made me a better writer, and you entertained me in the process.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have rarely found myself purchasing books online, and I feel extremely lucky to have happened upon this gem recommended in a stray Reddit comment. The world that Hugh Howey creates is a dreary dystopian future, with some parallels to Brave New World. People are discouraged from talking about \\"the outside\\" of their silo, else they be sent out to \\"clean\\" the windows to the contaminated environment outside, a certain death sentence. The characters are easy to connect with and the story is compelling. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and I am eagerly anticipating the author's next book.
B005LAIH9A|4.0|For those that love the American Pie series this is a fun trip down memory lane with homage to the raunchy, dirty, uncomfortable jokes that made us love the series in the first place. 4 stars because admittedly the plot and story could be a liiiitle bit stronger...ok a lot stronger.... But let's be honest, we're not watching it much for the plot. In summary, the gangs all back doing what they do best...with many of the classic jokes that long time fans foun d hilarious (and still do) and a nice mix of new comedy as well. Mav
0525478817|5.0|First of all, this book wrecked me. Wrecked. Me. I was a sniffling, sobbing mess starting about 2/3 of the way through the book. My husband came in and was like, \\"Hey, got something in your eye?\\" (Because he is a heckler and has a heart like a STONE), and I choked out between ugly-cries, \\"It's about KIDS with CANCER! LEAVE ME ALONE!\\" And he skedaddled out of there.<br /><br />So if you want a book to make you cry, I'd suggest this one.<br /><br />But this book is not all tears and angst. It's actually full of humor and sweetness. Considering it's a book about KIDS with CANCER, I was not expecting to laugh so much. But laugh I did.<br /><br />The highlight of the book for me was the characters of Hazel and Gus. It's funny, because I was reading along and thinking \\"Wow, Hazel and Gus remind me of some of my friends from high school. Especially Gus, who is pretty much EXACTLY like this guy I knew, except for the cancer thing.\\" And then I went online and read some reviews, and the first ones I read were complaining that Hazel and Gus were unrealistic, and no teens act or talk like them. Just goes to show that how we perceive things is heavily dependent on our own life experiences.<br /><br />So just for the record, yes, some teens act and talk like Hazel and Gus. Some teens have large vocabularies and use SAT words in everyday conversation. If you take out all the cancer references, I swear I had some of the Hazel-Gus conversations when I was in high school.<br /><br />Yes, I was a nerd. But that's neither here nor there.<br /><br />On top of the great characterizations and dialogue, the storytelling was excellent. I was riveted by the first page, and couldn't find a good place to put the book down, so I wound up reading the whole thing in a day. Which is no small feat when you have to also be parenting and cleaning and cooking and all those other things responsible adults do.  But it was just one of those books that you have to keep reading, even when you realize it's going to rip out your heart and stomp on your soul.<br /><br />I loved the friendships in the book; I loved the sweet and sad way that Gus and Hazel's relationship developed;I loved the glimpses into their friend Isaac, Hazel's and Gus' parents, and the members of their support group. I loved how real and raw and honest Hazel and Gus were about what they were going through. Basically, I loved everything about this book, except for the way it utterly ruined me. And I even kind of loved that.<br /><br />Some people say this book has a twist. I didn't really think of it as a twist -- nothing in the book surprised me -- and I think if you go into it expecting it to shock and amaze you, you may come out disappointed.<br /><br />However, if you read this book for the great characters, fantastic dialogue, and gut-wrenching levels of emotion, you will be satisfied. At least I hope you will be. I was.<br /><br />Even though it wrecked me.going to rip out your heart and stomp on your soul.<br /><br />I loved the friendships in the book; I loved the sweet and sad way that Gus and Hazel's relationship developed;I loved the glimpses into their friend Isaac, Hazel's and Gus' parents, and the members of their support group.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! It is very visible and is so convenient to have on the FIRE. I used it for the first time and as advertised, it always keeps your last entry so that if you forget you can go back to it. I highly recommend it.

1455839574|2.0|I find it sort of interesting but hard to finish after stumbling over the inaccuracies, like the claim that \\"breaking bread\\" was an etiquette term from the Middle Ages to discourage knife violence, as though the term did not exist before, when in fact it is in plain sight in much literature that predates the Eucharist.<br /><br />He claims that King David launched a coup against Saul. Never happened.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Of course the book itself was great, and the price was fantastic too!!! I was expecting it to be more expensive, and was VERY pleasantly surprised at the low price!
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|This movie was different than what we normally watch.  It kept my interest and the characters were interesting.  I would not rush back to see it but would watch it again if I catch it on TV.
B006M9NJFG|3.0|This felt like a great product when I received it. But I soon discovered that one of the two I bought leaked pretty badly. I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning it so I found a rubber washer that was about the right size, and pushed it up into the cap, now it is totally watertight.<br /><br />I'd advise testing this out as soon as you receive it, and before you get rid of the shipping box.
B00138EV8U|5.0|I had the cassette of the soundtrack many years ago so I was happy to see Amazon was selling the soundtrack at a special price. Now I have the DVD and the soundtrack of my favorite movie. Not to mention a great memory of Patrick Swayze.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I absolutley love it! this game is so addictive, I cant stop once I start! Everyone should try this game!!!
B000I0QM04|4.0|I thought this movie was ok. Jude Law was great of course -  I wasn't overly keen on the storyline but it is what it is. Gywneth plays a Journalist and Angelina Jolie a sky pilot who leads a squadron against an evil mastermind etc.<br />It's marvel comics genre but outside the box. Kind of a spin off.<br /><br />Good acting and the whole thing was done greenscreen which blew me away. Really brilliant for what it is - but not really a girls movie I think.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|Entretiene 20 segundos, de resto aburre. Es predecible y realmente no genera nuevas cosas que permitan apegarse. Es un juego muy pasivo,lento. esperaba m&aacute;s.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The only thing wrong about this book are the few typos here and there.  The story is beautiful and funny at the same time.  The characters' background made the story even more interesting.  You will get laughs and excitement.  Loved it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After reading great reviews and seeing this book recommended by Hoda Kotb, I was excited to read this book. The first half was great. Without giving anything away for those of you who will read it anyway, the book took a turn toward ridculous. The end seemed like a soap opera plot that insulted my intelligence.

B005ETA5K2|4.0|In BT5 R2...<br />Right out of the box: chipset is displayed as unknown. Drivers get loaded (the drivers that loaded were not specifically made for this chipset), but the drivers crash when doing some intensive scanning/injection. Nonetheless, the drivers manage to keep the device working. I have never really tried using this product for prolonged use in managed mode however.<br /><br />In Windows 7...<br />Used the CD that came with the product to install the Win7 drivers. Windows still couldn't find the drivers for the device.<br /><br />Gave this product a 4/5 for it's awesome performance in Linux even though the drivers used were not specifically for this device. I can just imagine how much more potential can be squeezed out if some proper Linux drivers were written for this device :D
0307959856|5.0|I loved Death Comes to Pemberley. For those that remain skeptical about whether any take-offs on Jane Austen's beloved Elizabeth and Darcy could ever be successful, lay your skepticism to rest. This book was fun, and James wonderfully recaptures Austen's voice even as she weaves a fine mystery. Excellent!
B000JMKO3C|5.0|[[ASIN:0061124265 Veronika Decides to Die: A Novel of Redemption]]<br /><br />Reading 'Veronika Decides to Die' was a wake up call for me. It made me want to be true to myself and want to achieve my dreams! It gave me the strength to her up one morning and say: 'I have enough of all this. I am going travelling!'<br />And this is what I did! I went travelling for a year around the world by my self.<br />A few years later I wrote a book about my travels: Mint Tea to Maori Tattoo (by Carolina Veranen-Phillips), which has recently been published.<br />If you liked Veronika Decides to Die you might also like Mint Tea to Maori Tattoo!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|THIS IS A FRIVOLOUS NOVEL FILLED WITH PLASTIC CHARACTERS. IT IS VERY RARE THAT I DON'T FINISH A BOOK. THIS ONE I HAD TO ABANDON AFTER THE THIRD CHAPTER
B003EVWDR0|1.0|I didn't like this movie. Now that I have said that, let me continue with the fact the cgi was AMAZING. I can't say enough about the special effects, they drew you in and it felt real even though you knew it wasn't. However I hated the plot and not just because it was a reboot of Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was interested in it because it was James Cameron and he did good stuff. However, what really clinched it was that scene where Quaritch is drinking his coffee in the cockpit of the gunship and all the missiles are shooting around him. I said myself \\"That was such a BA scene and character that I have to see this movie\\". I think I am the only person who watched the movie and connected the most with Quaritch. I thought that Jake was a traitor, he gave his word and then he disobeys his commanding officer, switches sides and fights against the people who spent tons of money to bring him out there and give him the avatar. In other words he stabbed RDA in the back with the knife they bought him. I didn't like the message of how the evil corporations controlled the government and the military, ruled a planet, destroyed the earth,and simply wanted to genocide a race of Native American blue monkeys just to mine a magnet. In short the movie was written to make Greenpeace happy and to start the Occupy movement, it's like the 70s all over again. I also got the not so subtle attempt to compare Jake with William Wallace and the Na'vi with the Scots (blue, really?). I also didn't like the anti-military peace message. \\"(said with utmost sarcasm) After all, the evil corporations control the military and we are in Afghanistan to secure oil reserves (said with utmost sarcasm)\\" just like how the military was on pandora to secure resources for the RDA in the movie.
1451627289|2.0|Time travel is inherently an interesting subject to me, and even with flaws, I can greatly enjoy stories about it. For example, the Time Machine by H.G. Wells. The author himself would state that it was amateurish in comparison to his other works, nevertheless, the story remains compelling, and very readable.<br /><br />King's...uh. It actually started out quite well. The initial discovery of, and journey through the portal, and the time spent in Maine was a good read. For that, it gets the extra star. The problem is what happens after. Blah, blah and blah, mostly. I got to about page 700 and realized I really could not care less about how the story ended. The characters lost their appeal, it became some sappy soap opera love story I wasn't interested in. And the love scenes, oh my God, the love scenes. Hilariously awful.<br /><br />The amount of JFK/ Lee Harvey oriented pieces of the story were few and far between. The buildup wasn't there. And with King's notoriously poor endings what was left, I decided to circumvent that and just end it. It had potential, but it didn't play out that way unfortunately.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game..addictive and increasingly challenging. makes you really think ahead and think of the bigger picture. Try it and I bet you will like it too.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I have all three of the Bourne DVD's and I am excited about receiving the new Blu Ray Trilogy so I can enjoy all of the extra features and commentaries and actually see the difference in the Video Quality.  I ordered the Trilogy on the 13th and received it today the 16th and that was with the Free Super Saver feature. The Trilogy was only $29.99 so that is $10 apiece and I paid more than that for the DVD's.  I haven't even had time, yet, to see the blu ray's.  I know I will enjoy them since I have a new Samsung Blu Ray 3D player and 42 inch Visio 3d 1080i 240 htz TV, and a new HDMI 7.1 Pioneer amp with Home Theatre Type surround sound speaker system with 200 watt sub woofer---sorry bout that---but I am excited not bragging----well, maybe a little bit.  I don't go out much so I save my money to get a quality Movie experience at home.  Now, If I could only get them to lower the price on the Star Wars Blu Ray extravaganza.  Actually, the DVD's video looks pretty good when they are up-converted.  But, still kind of lacking in the sound department.<br />The Bourne Identity---the Blu Ray is definitely better than my DVD version (even with the 1080i up-convert.  The Video is clearer, the DTS Sound is Super and the Extras are worth buying the Blu Ray (if for no other reason).  I spent hours last night and I only watched the Extras---picture in picture----and stand alone docs.<br />I didn't even get to the Commentaries and I had a whole nights entertainment with<br />only one disk.<br />More later  I Love it, Kelly
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this a great and fun game that the whole family will enjoy. I hope that more games like this will come.<br />A Ny other games will be welcomed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I strongly recommend the Wool series.  I purchased the Omnibus based upon the outstanding (quantity and quality) Amazon reviews and was not disappointed!  The story grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go.  I read during every spare moment and am now anxiously awaiting #7.  I'm not typically a huge fan of the sci-fi genre, but the story and themes in Wool are universal, entertaining, thought-provoking, and very well-written.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Not much to say. It's a rip off of the app &quot;Router&quot; except this has ugly blocky cheesy graphics. Don't waste your time.

0201433079|5.0|This book does not answer all questions but its definitively very good book to deepen your knowledge of UNIX systems and how are different UNIX descendants relate and differ. The authors chose 4 UNIX OS's to make examples with Linux, Solaris 10 BSD and Mac Os. They also answer one intriguing question which system resembles SVR4 the most meaning which OS out of 4 has the most implementations in common with SVR4.<br /><br />You will not be dissapointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey has been the best book that i've read in a long time. It is definitely a page turner and one that can't be put down. I enjoyed each and every part of it and it keeps you wanting more. Great Job E.L. James. I'm looking forward to more readings from this Author.
1400034779|4.0|The wonderfully imaginative, absorbing and playful plot of this novel is almost as fabulous as the brilliant creation of Mma Ramotswe, in my opinion one of the best characters in print. With all the gorgeous quirks of culture and language her nationality entails and her penchant for red bush tea, as well as her total integrity and endearing personality, she makes for a series one can dip into as if hearing the stories of an old friend, albeit a very interesting one.<br />The heat, smells and beautiful details of life in Botswana are instantly transferred into the living room, train carriage or damp bus stop of the reader in this amazingly atmospheric book.
B0088W6D30|1.0|The actors do their job, too bad the writing, story line and production is so poor.  Nothing ever has an ending,  just a series of disconnected events....

0670022411|5.0|I loved this book!!!!! It carried me right into another time, the sophisticated, magical, timeless vampire existence... very romantic, thrilling, and beautiful.<br />One of my all time favorites!!
B006G7Y7GY|4.0|This book started out with me laughing uproariously on every page until I got to the part where he found a job he \\"loved.\\"  Killing animals.  I cannot dig out of me any feelings of affection or respect for someone that loves killing animals and Ozzy did it all the way through the book.  When Turpin came into the picture, I was afraid to read further for fear he was going to kill the horse too.  It IS a very well written book, no doubt, but I have no respect for his meanness and his disregard for so many.  Even the death of his \\"friend\\" Andy, didn't stop him from making a fool of himself with drugs and alcohol.  Towards the beginning of the book I thought Sharon was going to be good for him but she was just as irresponsible as he was.  The book was hard to read after his slaugherhouse gig.  I'm not through with the book yet and am somewhat hesitant to read much more.  Ozzy, at least for a good share of his life, was an idiot and downright dangerous to be associated with.  But a good book about a very lucky and abusive person.<br /><br />...............I've finally finished the book and I have to admit, as much as I don't care for the person John Osbourne, this was probably the funniest book I've ever read.  His descriptions of his escapades were so well written, I could actually see him in his predicament.  If he truly wrote this book, he's a very talented writer.  I just wish he was a better person.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|I recently read this as part of a teacher's children's literature course. I decided to read this, since our theatre was running this movie, and it was being discussed by some of the teachers at school. I enjoyed this book because it was a an exciting story, and one that would give a sense of World War One to a young reader.  It also had a strong message of pacifism, as exemplified by conversations between various characters, and the scene in the middle of the book where two soldiers on opposite sides enter the \\"No Man's Land\\" area to rescue Joey, the horse that was trapped between.  They settled to which side the horse was to go by the flipping of a coin, a great symbol of how disputes could be settled without fighting.  This is a hopeful story throughout, although there was a good deal of sadness and loss.  It is written from the point of view of the horse, and told in a swift, simple style.  A great story that will be educational to young readers. I would guess it could be read by as young as Fifth Grade or so, up to young adults.  Even adults would appreciate the story. Since I haven't seen the movie, I don't know how it compares, but the book is great.

030758836X|3.0|Good book, it started slow but I gave it a try. The story got even better with all the twists and turns. I even stayed up late nights but all that sacrice for such an ending????????
1439153663|2.0|I thought the premise of the book sounded interesting, and I like historical fiction.  The characters were interesting, if a bit too broadly drawn and stereotypical.  I agree with others who have said that they don't understand the favorable reviews.  The ending was simply awful.  I don't know if the author was allowed only so many words by some editor-on-high or if she simply ran out of steam. One of the most important plot lines in the story is completely unresolved, and the actions come so fast at the end, it is practically dizzying. I found myself going backward through my Kindle, certain that I had somehow skipped a chapter.  I dislike being set up for a sequel, but that is what is being done here.  Given all the favorable reviews, I am sure it will sell well, but I will not be one of those buying it.

B008CP93S0|5.0|I read a lot of reviews before going ahead and deciding to rent this movie. I am a woman in my thirties who loves comedies, especially romantic comedies. And if you are someone who has kept up with recent movie trends in comedy, you know that nudity and vulgar humor is nothing new. If you have seen \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\" and \\"American Reunion\\" you have seen male nudity. Honestly, it's about time. We've been watching naked women for decades on television. It's about time some naked men were added to the mix.  Most of the reviews here have exaggerated the amount of nudity in this movie. Basically, just one guy is naked through the movie, with one scene at the end in which everyone is running and naked (and it's funny).<br /><br />I won't get into details about the movie itself, but if you like today's idea of what a comedy is or a romantic comedy, like \\"My Best Friend's Girl,\\" you will enjoy this movie. I laughed many times. Paul Rudd is his usual hilarious self (and even funnier) and you get to see another side of Jennifer Aniston that she has yet to display in prior films. I really enjoyed this movie. I just got done watching it and am going to watch it again. Although, I felt the need to write this review for all the other people out there like myself, who are open-minded, down to earth, enjoy a good laugh and don't take offense to nudity. It's not one of those cheesy movies you watch and want to stop watching 5 minutes in. It's interesting and entertaining from beginning to end. I truly can't understand all of the bad reviews, unless the world consists of a lot of snobby, pretentious people? If you are a red-blooded, meat-eating (or vegan) American, you will love this movie! I hope that my review has done the job of helping others like myself decide whether or not they would like to rent this. If you want to be entertained and laugh, rent this movie now. If you are looking for some philosophical movie with some intrinsic deeper meaning, rent something else. Again, I really enjoyed this and am watching it again.gain, I really enjoyed this and am watching it again.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I've read this on the fanfic and I loved it. Christian and Ana find something that neither can define at first and to watch them on their journey has been great so far. The author challenges the traditional romantic relationship and makes the reader question how far they'd go to be with someone. [[ASIN:B0085BG1HC Death Too Soon]] and this book are one of my favorite.

B007K87C4M|4.0|I have followed Steve Wilson since Porcupine Tree, automatically buying all releases from this numerous sub projects including, No Man, Bass Communion, IEM, Blackfield, etc.<br />I missed a few of those limited editions.....<br /><br />I was expecting so much from this collaboration as Wilson brings out the best in everyone, even when he is only producing the record as the case with Opeth, Kallocain and even Fish. His latest Grace for Drownings holds up for repeat playings identifying new layers every listen.<br /><br />But SW a tendency to drone on as he admires this genre, recently stating he listens to Zeit monthly [..]<br />The other members of Porcupine Tree are able to counter this tendency.  But I fear Mikael Åkerfeldt alone is not enough to balance out the duo. Drag Ropes could be a single, it has a great video, but this CD just does not stand up to the total canon of Wilson music.  Åkerfeldt and Opeth have their own great path to lead and their musical competition with Wilson have only made each group stronger.<br /><br />I have backed off from Bass Communion especially after the grating Molotov and Haze.  But I find elements of this noise pollution infecting Storm Corrosion.  I listen again and again and find nice bits, but I feel SW is spreading himself too thin to give the best to all his many groups. He has chosen to give his total life to his work and integrity which means he works harder than other musicians with distractions. He is backing out of Blackfield, so maybe he wants to spend more time himself on each CD he works on.
B007V9YF5E|4.0|Very Nice suprise. The acting was suprisingly good by the star. Not perfect, but good. The action and fight scenes were great as well.
B0018QQQK8|1.0|This is one of those books that after the 1st chapter you have hope. by the 3rd chapter you begin to wonder: \\"Where is this going?\\".  After the 4th chapter you know exactly where it is going and how it is going to get there and the fluff in between is about as sappy and drawn out and redundant as it could possibly get. The ending is as predictable as it could possibly be.  You know there is something wrong with a book when the humans get all the ink but the dog is the most exciting character.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Just loved it. Fifty Shades is amazing, [[ASIN:B008BGYI0S Revenge And Blood Sacrifice]] too. I'm on my second read of it because I've enjoyed it that much. Simply brilliant! Really hoping one day this will be a movie! wow!!!
0345803485|1.0|Just a suggestion. If you want to read good erotica, look at Literotica. Granted there is a lot of crap there too, but there are many stories better written and more imaginative than this tedious tripe. And they are all free.<br /><br />I do have to give the author props for making a boat load of money by disappointing so many people like me who couldn't resist the hype. Well done. I'd get a refund on this book that is sucking up space on my iPhone if I could. Fortunately I can delete it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. It's so fun and addicting! I don't have any problems with it. I know some people have trouble getting out of it but all you do is go the the options and there will an open door that you press to get out.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like this game. Helps me calm down. Less problems with me and my brother. Teens and adults should play this game after a long day
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|OMG! I couldn't put it down, loved loved loved it like [[ASIN:B0083867XU The Last Of The Rings]]! The only thing that I didn't like about it was it wasn't LONG enough! I need more and soon!
1451627289|5.0|I read King ages ago, back when he was writing his horror classics (Carrie, The Shining, etc.) but I haven't read anything of his in a long time. This book was just great! It reminded me of why I enjoyed him so much to begin with. He has such a natural, smooth narrative style and you are there with him for every moment. This story was honestly outstanding, and I think it will be known as one of his all-time best. I was so bummed whenI turned the final page.
B007B5EDEG|4.0|The epitome of characters that you love and those you love to hate. Likely some or both will die by the end of the book so if you stop reading books when your favourite character dies, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />It meets the needs of both the male desire for blood lust and the female desire for complex relationships. Throw in a little morally questionable behaviour and some quick witticisms and you have a mixture for a fantastic series. Make sure you put away readying time because your likely to lose a couple of hours in the day when you pick it up.<br /><br />Relating directly to the Kindle version, there are numerous errors throughout the book which need the attention of an editor, but if you can put aside the aggravation these cause and continue on to the next page it won't disappoint.
B0058YPL66|5.0|ONE  OF  THE  MOST  INTRESTING SHOWS  OUT  THERE  TO  WATCH  AS  GOOD  AS  LOST  I  LIKE  ALL  THE TWISTS  AND  INTERACTION  OF  THE  CHARACTERS  THIS  AND  WAREHOUSE  13  ARE  ABOUT  THE  ONLY  SHOWS  I  WATCH
B006RUJST6|4.0|The romance was gut wrenching and had me cheering for Layken and Will and their happily ever after from the beginning. This book was amazing could not stop reading it Will and Lake are a great couple everything they go thur just makes them love each other more.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|my only complaint that the ads take up the entire screen and pop up after every mini game and are usually for things I don't care about.
B002TVQ4AS|5.0|Another great undertaking by Ry Cooder. He just has a way of discovering and presenting good music. What else needs to be said, anybody who knows Ry will enjoy this dvd.
1250006341|5.0|This is far more than just another \\"coffee table book\\", or an attempt to make money off the series.  Not only does it offer great \\"tidbits\\" about the production, but it continues the series' effort to inform us of the mores of the time Downton is set in.<br /><br />I particularly liked the anecdote about the pre-wedding sex advice the author's grandmother received from her mother.  The poor dear, of course, had no idea what was to happen, and was filled with trepidation, until she was told \\"the one important thing\\" she should know: \\"It's terrific fun!\\"<br /><br />Definitely worth buying.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I cant wait to read next book. You will want the next book as soon as your done with this one, this book is good too [[ASIN:B0083867XU The Last Of The Rings]].
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this app has always worked excellent on my kindle.Its fun an addictive like the original but with new levels what more could you ask for.Also the adds are very small I never even notice them.
B00004SCX6|2.0|While the music from this CD was okay at best, Britney just does not seem to have an original idea in her entire body.  Do what people tell her, go wherever they say to go, etc.  I found it very empty.  The music might sound good, but that's about all you can say.  What she says in her songs on this CD is very lacking.  Hands down across the board.
B006QANR5I|5.0|Most people probably know this, but just in case:<br /><br />Don't worry that this DVD won't play in the U.S.A. - you don't need it anyway!  \\"Christmas At Downton Abbey\\" is included in the DVD set for Season 2 (and the Seasons 1 and 2 combined sets).  So get them and enjoy!<br /><br />Now, if only we could have the DVD of the upcoming confrontation between Lady Violet, the Dowager Countess (Dame Maggie Smith) and Martha Levinson, Lady Cora's mother (Shirley McClain).  Where's Dr. Who's TARDIS when you really need it!
B00846REIS|3.0|I guess my biggest problem with this book is that it felt rushed. It seems like Ms. Day had a perfectly good concept for a story, but some executive said to her, \\"Hey we need you to crank out that book that you've been working on, with a quickness. Fifty Shades customers are in search of more material, so throw in some Dom/Sub stuff and forget about a back story. Forget building any suspense and concentrate on adding more sex scenes. In other words, make it Fifty-ish.\\"<br /><br />I laughed out loud on a few occasions because of the crudeness and the blatant attempt to be as Fifty as possible. For example, Gideon said to Eva, \\"Are you sleeping with anyone?\\" \\"Because I want to f*** you, Eva.\\" Really? Who says that on the third time that they've ever laid eyes on someone? Having said that, I enjoyed most of the book when they weren't trying to be a cheap Fifty knockoff. I didn't feel like I knew or even understood the characters as much as I knew and understood Ana and Christian, so I hope that they do a better job of opening them up in the next book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its really good i like it except for the bills because i cant get the mand  they are stupid its ok.
B004DSX5B6|1.0|Cons:<br />- Quite bulky and heavy for what it offers<br />- Knife is very short<br />- Philips driver is nearly flat<br />- Pliers nearly broke trying to untwist a wire hanger<br />- Very very difficult to pull out any tool (even if you had nails)<br /><br />It's not the worst tool but there are FAR more practical and better multi-tools in that price range!

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was about in this trilogy.  I now know that E.L. James cannot write.  Poor characters and prose abound in this series.  I don't know how many times Ana can 'look down at her fingers' or 'look up through her eyelashes', while Christian 'runs his hads through his hair'.<br /><br />I found it to be repetative and boring.  After the first few sexcapades it gets old and unrealistic.<br /><br />I'll stick with J.K. Rowling and Stephen King, thank you!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Looks pretty good and isn't too bulky.  I dropped my iPhone from my kitchen counter (about 4ft) onto hardwood flooring it was perfectly fine!  Dropped it a few more times since and nothing!  Great case!

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I received this bag/backpack as part of an Amazon promotion for my camera and/or lense, so it was more or less free. I had no real solid expectations since I had never seen this particular design for a case from anyone else who sells camera cases. What a nice surprise! I shoot wildlife and hike out to my favorite areas, sometimes several miles. This pack is strong and roomy and holds my Nikon D7000 w/telephoto lense just perfectly! Extra lenses, cards, cables, etc. You name it. Since I go out more than three times per week, I also use this case to store it when I'm not shooting. Love the case! If someone stole it from me I would gladly pay for another!

B005KELQEU|5.0|I love this Kindle sleeve. It is exactly what I wanted to protect my basic Kindle model. I purposefully didn't buy the most expensive Kindle on the market and didn't want to spend close to half the Kindle's purchase price on a sleeve or case.<br /><br />This sleeve protects my Kindle perfectly and is simple easy to zip up. (I read one of the reviews that said their Kindle didn't fit. Maybe they had the larger versions, but my basic Kindle fits with ease.)<br /><br />It is not a case so you don't use it while reading, but I don't see a need for a case while reading. The device is small enough to easily hold in your hand and lighter than most books.<br /><br />If you want a simple and inexpensive sleeve to protect your Kindle, then this is it!

0756407125|5.0|I reveled in The Name of the Wind, and Rothfuss kept me enthralled with Day Two of the Kingkiller Chronicles, The Wise Man's Fear.  Again, I found myself settling into my customary reading position with a contented sigh, anticipating at least an hour lost in another, fascinating world, and staying up much later than I should because I had to keep reading!  He selects his words with care and manages to cut out the details that don't carry the plot forward while creating a rich, full world alive with experience and feeling!  I'll leave longer, more detailed reviews to the others here, but I'd like to ask: When can we have Day Three???  Happiness is a well-written book!

B0060YIBLK|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, Robin is both a professional colleague and friend.  Robin seeks to share what he has learned over the years as a US Naval Academy student and graduate, USMC Officer, FBI Special Agent, and human being.  His self-deprecating style and illustration with example demonstrate not only theory, but practical application of the techniques he discusses.  Robin strives to have both \\"book smarts\\" and real-life experience about human behavior.  He has taken the time to examine his own experiences, learn about and discuss the theories involved, and tell the truth, both good and bad, about the outcomes.  He does so in a way that is easy to understand, capitalizing on a common sense approach to what can often be a tricky topic, reading and influencing human behavior.  This book is a quick read yet carries with it long lasting information.

B006Z2WE0G|1.0|I read this book for my book club, and everyone thought it was terribly written, trite, and the WWII story was overly simplified.  I suggest reading something else if you are interested in this issue.  The story of what happened to the Jewish people in France is a story that needs to be told, and people need to read it - however, just not in this book.

0345803485|1.0|PLOT<br /><br />This book is 382 pages of the main character, Anastasia, narrating herself as she eats, sleeps, thinks, and writes emails. All of the above mentioned activities revolve around a contract Christian Grey wants her to sign, and it all becomes redundant and boring. Perhaps the book would be more interesting if Anastasia Steele was an interesting person with interesting thoughts, but describing her as extremely dull is an understatement.<br /><br />SEX<br /><br />The only reason I can imagine people want to read this book is for the sexual content, which is extremely overhyped. It's nothing to write home about, and if you're an adult with sexual experience, you might even find this book to be downright cheesy. The author uses the word \\"ass\\" maybe once or twice, but usually writes \\"behind\\" and even \\"buttocks\\" throughout the majority of the book.  The vagina is referred to as \\"down there\\" and \\"sex.\\" I actually laughed aloud many times at how ridiculous this book was. I think people read this book expecting to get all hot and bothered, but I think there are much more efficient ways to accomplish that. In fact, I'm even willing to bet that Penthouse has employed better editors than E.L. James has. What a shame.<br /><br />POOR EDITING<br /><br /> The author is British, which is fine, but the editors failed to remove some of her very British dialect from this book, which takes place mostly in and around Seattle. For example, she calls the frozen meat section of the grocery store the \\"meat cabinet.\\" Instead of describing Anastasia's skirt as hiked up, she says it is \\"rucked up.\\" Apart from that, there are several typos and editing errors throughout the book making it downright annoying to read, unless you're an illiterate porn addict.<br /><br />ANNOYING<br /><br />On every turn of the page you will read an argument Anastasia has with herself, her \\"inner goddess,\\" and her \\"subconscious.\\" I am not exaggerating. It's like she has multiple personality disorder. The way she describes how her \\"inner goddess rears her ugly head and purses her lips at me while my subconscious crosses her arms and rolls her eyes\\" is reminiscent of the way the cartoon version of Lizzie McGuire pops up on the screen in the Disney show \\"Lizzie McGuire.\\" All this writing style manages to accomplish is making the reader want to slap Anastasia, her \\"inner goddess,\\" and her \\"subconscious.\\"<br /><br />Another thing I find annoying about this book is how ridiculously unbelievable it is. Anastasia is a twenty-three year old college student, smart, pretty, and a virgin.  Christian Grey is a twenty-six year old billionaire who made his own money, is a skilled pilot, a classical piano prodigy, wine connoisseur, handsome, and single. Give me break!<br /><br />Christian Grey is also full of corny lines that make me want to vomit. One example is when Anastasia barely knows him, and she describes him as a knight, to which he replies \\"maybe a dark knight.\\" He is always saying \\"I'm dangerous, Anastasia.\\" But even with all this, the line I grit my teeth at the most is \\"Laters, baby.\\" Is that supposed to be sexy? Would a well-educated and cultured billionaire really say something like that? Any pebbles of attractiveness the author gave Christian Grey simply disappear with every uttering of those two words.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that this book originated as a Twilight fan fiction. I couldn't help but imagine Kristen Stewart as Anastasia, and Robert Pattinson as Christian, which makes this book even worse. I am convinced that E.L. James just jumped on the Twilight bandwagon to make a quick buck. Sadly, it worked out for her.<br /><br />This book has received an unwarranted amount of publicity and hype, and was even banned in a library in Florida, so now everyone wants to read it. I sell this book at my place of work, and I have had women ranging in age from ten years old to seventy years old inquiring if it is in stock. It's shocking, really, how a book canbe so lackluster and poorly written, yet be so successful.<br /><br />ROMANTICIZES ABUSE<br /><br />On a more serious note, I personally see a problem with this book romanticizing an abusive relationship. It's just a book, yes, but I think this is worth mentioning since even ten year olds are reading it. Christian Grey is a stalking, controlling man. It is not okay for your boyfriend to trace your location by your cell phone signal, and it is not okay for your boyfriend to stalk you. It is not okay for your boyfriend to tell you what you are allowed and not allowed to wear, how to wear your hair, and what mannerisms you may and may not have. The fact that this kind of behavior is romanticized in \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" deeply concerns me.<br /><br />\\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is the worst book I've read in my life, and a huge waste of time.
B0086700CM|5.0|well those of you who downloaded  it and it shut down your device that dosn't mean that its a bad game because it dosn't. do that. to everyone so stop saying its a bad game just because it shut down YOUR device!!!!!  maybe you just have bad luck or something!  ! !!!!!!  ll ok?  so please stop convinceing other people that. its a bad app.  you probobly. haven't even played it!!! because.  you said it shut your. device down
0439023513|1.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Hunger Games, less so Catching Fire, and was so dissappointed with Mockingjay! I do not understand why I seem to be the only person that finds the plot so weak, Katniss' character so dull and unlikeable.<br /><br />This book deals more with the nature of Panem and it's political structure, so it is amazing how little is explained with regard to the nature of the Capital's power structure, and the districts' governance. If the Capital has the technology (or magical powers) to create all the horrors of the Hunger Games, control of weather, killer mutant animals, birds that can sense a person's individual fears, ability to surveil anyone anywhere, how did it end up so defenseless against people with a few hand weapons? Why couldn't it feed all the people? Why didn't it have better spies? Why wasn't there a better defense of the Capital?  To think that these masses of almost starving peasant-like people, with seemingly no understanding of the Capital, or anything outside their district would suddenly see this 'Hunger Games hero' teenage girl (who is said to be somewhat unlikeable throughout the 3 novels)dress up in a superhero uniform and become suddenly transformed with understanding of their political situation and incited to somehow overthrow the Capital seems very implausible.<br /><br />The first novel had a gripping story and was such fantasy, that the details of the larger setting did not seem necessary for the plot. Unfortunately, as the next two novels became more about overthrowing a government, more reasonable and extensive explanation of Panem's technological discrepancies and sociological/political setting is warranted! Really, the Capitol can create a fissure in the earth to open up and swallow someone, yet they couldn't have some super-protective shield for the President? An entire district of people, who are unhealthy, mostly self-concerned, don't have any means of communication or transportation or weapons or seemingly any toolsfor a successful uprising become suddenly able?  Mockingjay's plot has  so many holes, that can not be overlooked because the story is so weak and frankly boring. This novel is a total failure in my opinion, complete silliness, even for young adult readers - I would think.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Easy to use and fun to play.  Ads are annoying but do not disrupt the game. Only between hands and easy to skip.

A must read for anyone who wants to work at apple or create an enduring business.<br /><br />Although it may have been somewhat incomplete as other reviewers alluded to, it drives at the heart of how Steve Jobs saw the world and strove to create a great and lasting company.<br /><br />There are a lot of lessons that can be learned by reading it.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|Fifty Shades Darker digs a little deeper into Christian's past and notice I said a \\"little\\" deeper. This book was a continuation of the first which was sex and more sex. The storyline was OK, not the worst I've read, but I could've done without all of the repetitveness. I think had E. L. focused more on the storyline, the book would've been so much better. She tantalized, teased and had us drooling enough in the first book. Book two should've still had the naughtiness, but toned down some to focus on other areas.<br /><br />Will I read another of E.L's books? Sure. I read the Fifty Shades trilogy and got to like Ana and Christian well enough. I would like to see them again, but only if the sex is a bonus and not all she has to offer.<br />flag

1400069289|5.0|I found this book to be a good read that kept you wanting to know more.  The author really does an excellent job teaching about how habits are made and how they can be changed.  The examples he gives make the reading interesting and applicable.  He gives examples of how habits can be used for the positive (to improve companies, help the brain damaged, help smokers quit) and for the negative (to promote \\"special rights\\" for the homosexual agenda, cause a man to murder in his sleep, and lead to a deadly fire in the London underground).  It's a recommended read for those wanting to dig deeper to understand habits.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This game reminds me of suduko but it is keeping my interest much longer. The larger puzzles can be very challenging. I like how this developer increases difficulty as you become more skilled.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Christian Grey is just as complicated as he is alluring, sexy and twisted. In Fifty Shades of Grey, we learn a great deal about a man whose stuck in a torturous childhood which has shaped his adult life. Inflicting pain, means being in control, taking back the dignity that was taken from him so long ago. His search for someone to complete him and indulge in his dark world comes to a halt the moment that Anastasia Steel literally falls through the doors of his office to interview him for the school's newspaper.<br /><br />Anastasia Steele is as docile as they come. She's naive to the world when it comes to being an adult completely. Living in the shadow of her beautiful and always sought after friend Kate, she has resigned to living her life through the heroines in books like the character Tess of the D'Urbanvilles.<br /><br />When she meets Christian, her world is opened up to sex, pain, love and other feelings that she can't begin to understand. Fifty Shades of Grey is an interesting book that explores the world of Doms and Subs. Christian has some habits that are less then desirable to even think about let alone write. I hate that Ana has to borrow Kate's clothes for every occasion. I can't stand that she's so low on herself and won't accept gifts like a car, Mac computer, I pod, money for her car and numerous other gifts that Christian has bestowed upon her. The mystery surrounding Christian isn't as complicated as one may think. Most of his struggles are all in his head. Inflicting pain seems to be the only elixir that can cure what's eating at him. Rather Ana knows it or not, she has some deep rooted issues of her own. Low self-esteem allows her to endure some of the madness that Christian deems as normal.<br /><br />I like the book for the story that it gives into a lifestyle that I knew little about and the love story that's sure to come. However, there is too much repeating, going back and forth and unnecessary fluff. I'm currently reading part two of the series. I like the added drama of a crazed sub that has been thrown into the mix. I can't wait until I've finished the series to see how everything plays out.ries.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|If you are upgrading from ear buds, you aren't going to want to go back. These head phones deliver pristine audio quality. Whether you are using them for music or other sound work, they provide the results you want. They are quite comfortable and block out essentially all the sound around you. I still use ear buds when I want portability, but when I'm working on a project or just looking for an optimal audio experience, I use my Sony Studio Headphones. They come in a carry bag, so they are portable, but aren't good for light weight packing, or for use during travel.<br /><br />Pros: Comfortable, Phenomenal sound quality, Great noise cancelling.<br /><br />Cons: Not good for use during travel, Padding wears out after long term use. The pads are replaceable, although replacement can be a little frustrating.<br /><br />Overall: Fantastic product. I would highly recommend them.
0345803485|1.0|OMG! I couldn't wait to get this book home and rip through the pages with my imagination swirling around with all the erotic detail I thought this book would offer but i was sadly left dissatisfied and bored! The only time my eyes popped out of my head was when trying to keep awake to read the damn thing and this was at 2pm in the afternoon!. All I kept thinking was \\"get to the nitty gritty instead of pouncing around the stupid contract and stop bitng your lip woman!\\".  This didn't take me to fantasy land, instead it took me to the land of nod, no wonder I see some women reading it like it's a newspaper on the train.  What a load of long dragged out nonsense.<br /><br />Now where did I put that Anne Rice book, \\"the clamming of sleeping beauty\\", that would be sure to keep me awake!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I think Fifty Shades Freed didn't live up to the first two books at all. There was a lot of flashbacking and telling vs writing in this book. A lot of questions went unanswered like Mia and Ethan's relationship or lack thereof, Kate's and Christian issue with one another and the lists goes on. Jack Hyde's character/cause seemed to be just thrown in as he was very underdeveloped as was most of the characters/causes in this trilogy. There was a lot of repeating of sentences and overuses of words that made the story drag. I understand the BDSM is what got everyone buzzing about this book, but after awhile, even that becomes reptitive and redundant. I think had E. L. spent more time developing the storyline as well as the characters, then this book could've really superceded it's hype.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|if u like depressing books then this is the series for u. i read the whole series and it is so realistic i thought the whole story is true. the end got me thinking so much. i absolutely loved it.
B002N5N4M6|1.0|I purchased The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Third Season.  Out of the 3 disks, the first 2 were so damaged that they would not play.  I was appalled that somebody would sell crap like that and call it \\"good\\" condition.  I chosed to throw it away rather than return it so it wouldn't get sold again.

B008K8U13K|5.0|this runs great on my kindle fire. not sure why so many people gave it bad reviews. maybe im biased because of how huge a sonic fan i am. my only complaint is how hard the special stages are with tilting. they do give you the option to change that feature though, so no biggie.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I could not put this book down. I was intrigued and amazed at the perspective from which the book was written.  I could completely see the world through this little boy's eyes.  As a teacher I loved the creative ways his mother finds to teach and engage his mind even in captivity. A definite must read!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love taking notes on my tablet and then getting to pick up to continue the same note in the same place on my computer. its also great for centralizing all of my writing and note-taking into one program. have not come across a single issue to quibble about. it works great with a number of other programs which allows you to synchronize all of your information from those other applications into this one program. absolute fan right here.
140053271X|5.0|I know this borderline heresy on Amazon's website, however, I truly prefer the Nook experience over the Kindle!  My main reason is no ads!  Why be tricked into paying $100 for a Kindle that spams you with advertisements when you can cut out the middleman and get an ad-free Nook?<br /><br />To be clear, Amazon has 2 identical Kindle Touch versions: with and without advertisements.  You can only get the ad-free version online (for $140) or shell out $40 AFTER you buy the unit.  What?  This is clearly a bait-n-switch because none of this is mentioned if you buy it in a physical store.<br /><br />The Nook comes with no advertisements and is a wonderful reading experience!  The touch screen is intuitive and responsive, the ebooks look great, and best of all, no hidden ads!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book for my tablet and read it in about 3 days.  Its a new spin on the future of the human race.  The people are oppressed but there is no lack of human spirit.  The main character, Katniss, is a fighter who has overcome many obstacles in her short life.  While Katniss is indifferent and skeptical the other main character in the book, Peeta, is charismatic and warm.  You fall in love with him immediately.  I enjoyed each and every character in the book and the descriptions of everything, right down to the clothing, was amazing.  The author's creativity with the futuristic aspects were intriguing.  I loved reading Katniss' thought processes and made me think about my own survivor instincts while she was struggling through the games.  You become the biggest fan and hunger for a victory!
0061914177|5.0|The book was great, even though it was a few years old and technology has changed. I'm just starting to run an internet business, so learned a lot.
B004LROMX4|4.0|I have always been a sci-fi geek since star wars; I'm only 34 people, lol!!! First off, it's been done before, anyone remember V, the lizard people with big ship's, hell ya, remember Jane Badler; a.k.a Diana, yum!!!  All together the story is intriguing, I say this, when the first episode aired, earth was already taken, military devastated, million's upon million's dead, pretty much a bad case scenario for all. This is not what the story, series is about, how do we, as society, bond, then kick the sh#$ out of Extraterrestrial's or in this case, green bug's and that tall alien. With this being said, still fun to watch, in which, and could this really happen to humanity if something like this was to happen. When it comes to the action, tactical aspect of the series, very much real life if it happened. Acting, good, could be better, the children need to be more involved in the story than thee adult's, since they have something major to do with the story, maybe season 3. The special effects need some improvement, not sure if it with the budget or not using Pixar or ILM. All in all, fun, captivating, any new series needs work, but they are on the right track.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the plot and character development throughout the book.  I would have been disappointed in the ending had I not already been aware that there was going to be a third book.  I am looking forward to reading the conclusion of the story and am hopeful that it will be as good as the first two installments.

B004U8VUUC|1.0|It could have been done in a more interesting way. It was slow going and predictable. Innocent girl meets wounded man, falls blindly in love, and he turns out to be the classic man who hasn't dealt with his own emotional scaring. I find it disturbing to be a true story, but in hindsight I felt that with different people writing the script and/or directing that it could have been more intense and suspenseful.
B00354YA4A|5.0|This book stayed with me long after I turned the final page.  I loved the storyline so much I watched the film a week later, which follows the book very closely.  As another reviewer said, the first 150 pages are slow and descriptive, but there is a reason the author has written in this manner.  You MUST soak up every work - don't skim over that, as it becomes the essence of the characters.  Keep going and you'll discover a book that is as beautiful as it is shocking.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I was thinking,\\" just an other action adventure, special affects movie \\", and browsing other movies and avoiding this one. finally out of curiosity I spied the trailer. My interest was peaked and a week or so down the road I caved in and watched it. Expecting a somewhat juvenile, cookie cutter supper hero production quickly turned my attention to the plot, characters, and special affects, all of which are excellent. The movie was long, but not long enough. I will watch it again and probably buy it, something I only do with movies that i know I can watch again without being board. You will not be disappointed.

B006LSZECO|3.0|First off, I think Flynn is fantastic in this genre.  The first half of this book was terrific and it hooks you deep and hard so you cant put it down.  Unfortunately, the second half becomes tedious with an ending that culminates into a fizzle.  Oh what could have been.<br /><br />I completely understand the characters and they certainly deserve each other, but give the reader some satisfaction.  Use a rogue meteor or a bus that runs a stop light that takes out what end up being two of the most annoying characters of any book I have read in quite some time.  Flynn had so many directions she could have taken at the pinnacle of this book, but instead she took a path that beat a drum that made me completely annoyed with the two main characters.  I just hope I can go a few months without a reference to the \\"Amazing Amy.\\"  I still consider myself a fan of Flynn's and I will give her a pass on this one in the hopes that she rebounds from it because she certainly knows how to peak a readers interest.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I read this book when it was first published and loved it. When the second book, Shadow of Night, came out, I read it again. This is rare for me with modern fiction, but I was anything but disappointed.<br /><br />It is a sweeping tale that avoids the cliched elements of unrequited love. Instead Harkness puts her heroine and hero together rather quickly and sets them upon a quest through the academic hallowed grounds of Oxford to the French countryside and beyond.<br /><br />Although the heroine is a witch and her love a vampire, the emotions and history are decidedly human. I was spellbound from first page to last.

0451203933|5.0|Mark Bowden's \\"Blackhawk Down\\" is the quintessential story of combat in the post Cold War era. What was originally intended to be a humanitarian mission by the Bush administration became a disastrous attempt at \\"nation building\\" during the early years of the Clinton presidency.<br /><br />Author Mark Bowden exhaustively researched the actions of Task Force Ranger and their opponents in the Habr Gibr clan in Mogadishu, Somalia utilizing FOIA to obtain DOD documents, video and audio records as well as interviews with participants on both sides. He paints a bloody picture of political wrangling, African clan warfare, face-to-face combat as well as professionalism and courage. We read of a US military that made a terrible mistake - underestimating one's opponent and paying the price.<br /><br />The author recounts the actions of many men on both sides in an almost minute-by-minute fashion as the operation proceeds over a period of only a few days. This is eyeball-level combat where the author writes in a no-holds-barred fashion. He gives the reader an excellent sense of the intense and bloody nature of combat at street level.<br /><br />This is an excellent history book that reads like a novel! Mark Bowden is a brilliant author that will leave the reader turning pages to the exclusion of everything else around them! Impossible to put down!<br /><br />The military reader will be able to clearly draw conclusions even though the author maintains a neutral tone and writing style. Clearly, the US military underestimated and misunderstood their opponents. The reader will cringe while reading how the US military did things which made the local population look upon them as an oppressive invader. What the Somalis lacked in skill and weaponry they more than made up for in numbers and determination. At the same time, the reader will marvel at the professional skill of the men of Delta Force and the Rangers fighting overwhelming numbers of angry, highly-motivated opponents. Additionally, we see the overdependence of the US military on high-tech equipment (like the helicopters that were more vulnerable than the US military thought) instead of tactics and devolving problem solving to the men on the spot.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that looks at the battle in Mogadishu from many different and opposing points of view. I recommend this book with five stars.nally, we see the overdependence of the US military on high-tech equipment (like the helicopters that were more vulnerable than the US military thought) instead of tactics and devolving problem solving to the men on the spot.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that looks at the battle in Mogadishu from many different and opposing points of view.

B006YTTVHO|1.0|This 'book' reads like a Powerpoint presentation. There's no depth to it, no substance, just headings and a few sentences to make the headings look expanded upon. They're not. I'm guessing it took the author about an hour to put together - half that if he used his actual Powerpoint slides. It's a waste of time, offers nothing of value, and shouldn't be offered on Amazon, even if it is free.<br /><br />If this is a topic that interests you, try Leil Lowndes's book \\"How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships.\\" It's a meaty book that actualy addresses the questions this book only pretends to address.

B0081KTI0E|4.0|I liked the original woman in black - wasn't happy to see a remake being made - and really wasn't happy that Daniel Radcliffe was in it.  I apologize.  Daniel does a fine job.  The movie is a good, solid remake of old time horror films where imagination provides the chills more than gore and shock (though there was a bit of both).  Our family all really enjoyed it.  If you are a fan of the old movie you'll probably like it.  If you liked the original version of THE HAUNTING you'll probably like this.  It was a good ghost story, and I'll probably buy it for my collection.  If you like slasher movies, gore, or shock-fests this will be too slow for you.
1594203334|5.0|I devoured this book in 2 days - just couldn't put it down.  I got this book together with \\"French kids eat everything\\", which is looooong & repetitive.  But Druckerman's writing is light & funny & keeps me engaged the whole time.  I laughed often.  The book is based on her personal observations and interactions with French parents and caregivers at local creche or l'ecole maternelle in Paris.  Her curiosity uncovered many unspoken French parenting rules that I found highly valuable, especially the sleep training part, which made me realize that my best friend totally tortured herself by chaining herself to her 2 babies by breastfeeding them on demand for over 18 mos EACH & finally crashed in to a nervous breakdown/depression from chronic sleep deprivation.  While author praises the French style parenting for the most part, she does point out briefly that it might not be as easy to implement on American soil, where every corner you turn, kids are snacking, and schools and kindergartens are not practicing the same principles to help you.  The book made me understand why so many American kids are diagnosed with ADHD & completely out of control.  Not the children's fault because they were \\"consumed\\" by their lack of control of their desires that weren't disciplined or tamed by the parents when they were little.  A must read for most American parents.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|This album was an unexpected piece from Rush. It's true to their sound but, being progressive, they've morphed into a more mellow Snakes and Arrows sound.  The album also shows a return to the rock operas Rush was known for in their early career, and the nature of the lyrics makes this listener wonder if this is their last album.  It's not Permanent Waves, so don't expect that, but the music and lyrics combine into something magical that keeps me a devoted Rush listener. \\"Wish Them Well\\" is amazing.

I really dont think it deserves all the hype it received. Apparently there are a lot of sexually frustrated women out there that found it addicting. I did not.  I really dont think its that great of a read. Not even sure if I will read the next two anytime soon. Rather predictable I thought.

1595141979|5.0|I have one word for you: Amazing. Shadow Kiss was such a thrill ride that I read all 440 pages in one night... I just couldn't stop. Now after that one amazing word, I think I may have a few other words for Richelle Mead because of how she made me feel at the end of this heart breaker. I'm only joking, Shadow Kiss has further put me in awe of Mead's talented storytelling and superb writing. I know I normally do spoiler free reviews and I can assure you I will not be giving away any huge plot twists, but be cautious in reading this review as I feel like I need to get some things off my chest that may spoil some mystery to the series.<br /><br />Shadow Kiss starts with our characters cooping with the events of the past and they must deal with the death of their friend. As this semester begins, the senior novices must begin their field training and they are each assigned a Moroi to protect. Rose believes everything is goign according to her plan: Lissa will be her Moroi, she's trying to make peace with her nonexistent relationship with Dimitri and she's coming to terms with her interaction with the Strigoi, but of course when things seem to be going their best, it's the the calm before the storm.<br /><br />Now as I said before, I went and saw Richelle Mead speak at her launch party for The Golden Lily and I had not read any of her books yet. She sympathized with her readers, not quite apologizing, for the ending of book three and in my head, I thought wow, these people are nuts. With all their whining and grumbling you'd think Mead had gone and kicked everyone's puppy. Now, I feel like she really did kick my puppy.<br /><br />This lady has a special way of ripping your heart out and stepping on it, while you still appreciate her writing and her big plot twist. Obviously I won't be giving away what happened at the end, but while I was beyond devastated (I may or may not have cried in my bed for a little bit at 1 am) I appreciated what she did. I've been reading a great deal of paranormal romances lately and they all end the same, something bad happens but then things right themselves and the couple snuggle but look forward to further evil in the next installment. While this makes me happy (obviously) it doesn't make for a very interesting story. In Shadow Kiss, I felt as though Mead turned my world upside down, which while sad, is a good thing! It kept things interesting and I am scrambling to get my hands on book 4.<br /><br />The story was actually longer than the other two in the series but i found it much easier to get through and I really enjoyed the story. After the devastation that occurred on their ski trip, our main characters have changed. They are more cautious, wiser and have a different out look on life than their fellow students at St. Vladimir's. I welcomed this change in personalities and it made fore a much more interesting read.<br /><br />Rose has a lot to deal with in this book as she finds out more about her relationship with Lissa and she has to come to terms with what's really inside of her. Is being a guardian and putting her Moroi's every need before hers something she wants? Rose questions a lot of her deeprooted beliefs in this story and she has to  make the hard decisions, which is one of the things I love most about Rose. I said in a previous reveiw that she's working her way up to one of my favorite heroines in YA fiction and I think she made it up to the top five. She is kick ass and I love her.<br /><br /> We also get to see more of her relationship with Dimitri. While I won't talk about this too much for fear of more heartbreak, I love him, plain and simple. I sense that Adrian is going to be moving into the spotlight a little more and I can't decide if I like him or not. While I love his charming whit and the bad ass air he exudes, I'm still stuck on Dimitri and I don't know if I'll be able to give Adrian a chance. Are you listening to me right now? What did Richelle Mead do to me?! On to book four...<br /><br />9 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading (keep tissues handy)<br /><br />Allison<br />[...]ues handy)    Allison  [...]

0765316994|4.0|If you're looking for stuff that's Star Trek related or, more specifically, stuff that sends up Star Trek - and if you've already read the marvelous [[ASIN:B005GNK0QK Night of the Living Trekkies (Quirk Fiction)]] - then take a gander at John Scalzi's REDSHIRTS. Not only does it parody Roddenberry's baby, but, startlingly, it demonstrates heart. It ends up resonating on an emotional level. Which is weird for a parody.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for new crew member, Ensign Andrew Dahl, to notice that something's off with the Intrepid, and never mind that it's the revered flagship of the Universal Union Space Fleet. Stationed in the ship's xenobiology lab, Ensign Dahl observes that his colleagues habitually vanish whenever the senior officers swing by. The warning bells really go off when he's made aware of the horrifying mortality rate of the Intrepid's away missions, that most of the junior staff tapped to join the senior officers off-ship tend to suffer fatal mishaps. Soon enough, the alarmed Ensign Dahl finds himself the latest expendable ensign, deployed on a series of calamitous away missions, and behaving irrationally and spouting melodramatic remarks. Can he and his fellow dispensable crew mates put their heads together and figure out what's really going on?<br /><br />If you haven't yet sussed out the plot twist, then I won't spoiler it. But John Scalzi does posit an explanation, however out of left field, concerning the tropes and  clich&eacute;s and narrative short-cuts so inherent in those cheesy, over-the-top sci-fi television shows (and, yes, while the original Star Trek is classic and thought-provoking, it is also cheesy and over-the-top). Have you ever shaken your head at the wacky, implausible science? Have you ever wondered how the ship's doctor or chief engineer or First Officer would arrive at the solution to some thorny problem just in the nick of time? Or questioned why two or three of the starship's topmost-ranking officers would opt to go on the same away missions? That's a pretty messed-up breach in chain-of-command protocol.<br /><br />As much as I liked this book, I can't tout it as one of Scalzi's best works. It doesn't top [[ASIN:0765348276 Old Man's War]] or [[ASIN:0765357003 Agent to the Stars]], or even [[ASIN:B002BWQ52M Zoe's Tale]]. REDSHIRTS, for roughly its first half, reads light and amusingly and spoofily, and don't be surprised if you're not initially invested emotionally. You may rail that the characters don't seem to be well-developed, but Scalzi's going somewhere with that. Halfway thru, the really good bits surface when the core characters - who are normally bit players - make an audacious move to take control of their fate. From there on, REDSHIRTS transmogrifies into a compelling sci-fi caper. More, Scalzi manages to integrate a strong emotional core to a meta-narrative of which mechanics up to that point had been geared towards parody and self-awareness. REDSHIRTS is a deliberately low-rent Star Trek knock-off, but it speaks to Scalzi's ability to manipulate his readers that they end up caring for even the more ancillary characters. Two of the three codas, and particularly the third coda, have unexpected impact. REDSHIRTS, breaking the fourth wall and delivering a lump in the throat.on the same away missions?

You may rail that the characters don't seem to be well-developed, but Scalzi's going somewhere with that. Halfway thru, the really good bits surface when the core characters - who are normally bit players - make an audacious move to take control of their fate. From there on, REDSHIRTS transmogrifies into a compelling sci-fi caper. More, Scalzi manages to integrate a strong emotional core to a meta-narrative of which mechanics up to that point had been geared towards parody and self-awareness. REDSHIRTS is a deliberately low-rent Star Trek knock-off, but it speaks to Scalzi's ability to manipulate his readers that they end up caring for even the more ancillary characters. Two of the three codas, and particularly the third coda, have unexpected impact. REDSHIRTS, breaking the fourth wall and delivering a lump in the throat.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|the best books i have ever read, very pleased with the kindle fire and ordering from amazon i rec my orders very quickly
0545403359|5.0|I have not read the book yet, but plan to since I loved the movie.  I am just leaving this to clarify that this is, in fact, a novel and NOT A PLAY! Ok, that's it. Not a play.  I will get back to you with a real review when I have read this: [[ASIN:0545403359 War Horse: (Movie Cover)]]
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Quite entertaining my friend. The familiarity of the game play makes it easy to figure out. Simplicity is precisely what some of us prefer.
0300169787|5.0|I can't help but feel sadness when I look through this book, because like some great fires, McQueen burned too brightly and went fast. His creations are absolute genius. It's incredibly sad to see one so talented die too young, yet I'm so very glad that he was able to share his talent with us. While I might never see these beautiful works in person (I really hope to), I can look at some of his masterpieces in this book and reflect on his awesome ability to transform people through costume.<br /><br />One has to be a HUGE personality wearing some of his creations (Gaga), or the clothes most assuredly wear THEM.<br /><br />Daughter is scared of the skeleton on the front cover and doesn't want to look at it. Otherwise, I'd have this on our coffee table in plain sight.
B0086700CM|5.0|cooooollllllllll game :) rad. I wish I was that dude exsept when he gets eaten by the monkey bird thingys :(
1604680547|5.0|I ordered this book because I am in a quilting group and we were interested in different patterns for the final stitching.  This book is full of ideas.  You can take the suggested idea or just a portion.  So many suggestions.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|What a fun read!  The comic book, movie, and videogame references were great and reflective, best geek book I have red in a while!  Great job Ernest - keep it weird!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kids love this game. keeps them busy. especially my son. he is on it for hours. my daughter also likes it. but she is still learning
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I love this movie. It teaches good lessons about life and that you should enjoy what you have while you have it, because one day you may lose it. Definitely a favorite for the whole family.
0739368435|5.0|This will be short and sweet.<br />I absolutely adored this book!<br />I am so glad that my friend recommended this book.<br />Emilie
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good family fun for everyone, would recommend this to all ages the only problem is if you go somewhere and you don't have Internet you cant play.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|One of the best sci-fi movies ever made. I enjoyed every minute of it. Highly recommend. Although I rented it to watch, but now I am buying it to add to my DVD collection. I hope that DVD sales will make up for poor box office in the US and Disney will find it possible to make a sequel.
B007R41E8O|5.0|great game.  loved it.  I would love more of this type of game.  would highly recommend.  keep the prices low and the games long
B007SSEBCU|3.0|One of the finest actress ( Streep)of our times brings life to one of the most remarkable figures of the 20th century. Whether or not you embrace conservatism, you have to agree that Margaret Thatcher was not just a important political figure but an extremely important one.<br />Told in a series of flashbacks, and through many imaginary conversations that Thatcher keeps on having with her husband, Dennis Thatcher or DT, this film is filmed after her tenure as the British PM. It traces her roots- small grocer's family, her entry into politics and finally her act as the British PM. We simply get a glimpse of her rise but only superficially. The movie does not reveal her relations with her children or friends. I realize that such an endeavor is impossible in the hour and 45 minute run time. However, to get a fleeting glimpse on the British PM, this film is great. Nothing more was expected and the film delivered just that . Three stars. 7/15/2012
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the games they're a lot of fun. everyone in the family likes them. both the kids and adults.
B001D2AYCI|3.0|Paranoid is a great album  but this is  NOT A CD with a DVD-AUDIO disc. it's just a cd with a crappy dvd. Complete waste of $30. The cd sounds the same as the my old copy, but really i bought it only for the DVD-AUDIO disc..which isn't even included. Companys need to start looking at the items before writing a description. This must be the 4th time i've been burn by a overpriced CD. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY this if you want a DVD-AUDIO disc. The normal dvd has DTS and a LCPM stereo track that sounds WORSE than the cd. I do not see a reason to own this at all since the cd version is $7.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is the best! I play it every single day even my cousin plays it.I also like to play kung fu scat!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great fun free game. I like the variety and being able to earn the reward points to unlock mord games.
0545091020|5.0|Love to listen to books on CD as I am a courier and in the car all day long. Loved this story. Can't wait to start book 2!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game! it wasn't necessarily what I'd expected it to be. It starts off fairly simple, but gets the mind going and before u know it ur addicted like me.<br /><br />I really want to say: GREAT JOB by BIG DUCK GAMES, LLC.<br /><br />-- iaan
B007Y5IAV0|5.0|Harakiri is an awesome album. It has the melodies and political aspects you would expect from Serj, with some system laced tracks thrown in. It's much harder than Imperfect Harmonies but not quite as melodic as Elect The Dead. If your a Serj or system fan buy this you will not be disappointed.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|so not worth it. the items are soooo small and the entire game freezes. this developer has made some really good games - this IS NOT one of them!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels is the sort of album that is both retro/reflective and forward looking. Retro/Reflective in that it is a concept album, one that had its roots in the band's 2112 days with aggressive instruments and long tracks that tell complex stories. One can see in this work the philosophical tendencies and pronouncements (credit to Peart) that this band is known for--if not always understood. These tendencies are articulated in a meaningful way here. It takes a few listen-throughs to get this.<br /><br />Forward looking, in that this is a culmination of decades of being Rush. The trio has applied its newest tricks here, in ways that are both artistic and unapologetic (\\"let's do a track that's guaranteed to get us air play\\" isn't a phrase you'd hear in the drawing room). One has to go a step further and realize that the group is pushing 60 now, and after a lifetime one cannot expect them to be the same arrogant, cocky bunch that mimicked Ayn Rand. At the apex of their career, it seems that they have learned to incorporate experience into this fantasy concept album. Their alter ego from Clockwork Angels has seen the best and worst of life, and relies on himself. It is his life, his approach to it, and his fate that he submits to, for better or worse. It is not a cheery album, but one that confronts and lives by its own code.
0061137456|4.0|Here we are granted invaluable insight into the making of \\"Howl.\\"  We see the visions and revisions of Allen Ginsberg, America's poetic enfant terrible, as he composes what is indisputably -- even if the more prim among us recoil from the vividness -- a literary masterpiece.  We see his drafts, the marginal corrections, the typescript itself as it evolves into the high-powered dynamo that we know so well.<br /><br />The annotations to Ginsberg's more recondite references are of immense worth to the reader, who can now situate this poem properly in its literary and temporal climate.  Also of vital importance is the small anthology of \\"precursor texts\\": the great poems of the past which inspired Ginsberg as he wrote his chef-d'oeuvre -- Whitman, Lorca, Shelley, William Carlos Williams, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Hart Crane, and even old Christopher Smart!<br /><br />We learn from this variorum edition that Ginsberg's prosody is always controlled, never to the point of hampering his freedom of expression, but always with an eye to enhancing the \\"diction galvanized against inertia.\\"<br /><br />Included also is a brief history of the legal battles surrounding \\"Howl\\" (in the sedate 1950s, the obscenity caused much startlement!), and a small sampling of the immediate critical reaction to Ginsberg's most famous work.  John Hollander's review fascinates, even though it is a hostile reaction -- Hollander's shamefaced pentimento, taking back some of his opprobrium, is appended.<br /><br />This volume will be of especial appeal to Ginsbergians, to champions of the Beat movement in literature, and to anyone who is fascinated by mid-20th century American literary history.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it  has so many games no more wasting space again its awesome better than buying edividual apps Avon awesome is its middle name
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I was searching for a book on my Kindle and came across this one. I learned a lot of interesting things from it.

B0086700CM|5.0|Its a fast pace game with no ending or I just never found it. you guys will like it a lot!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I bought the book as everyone was talking about it and there were thousnds of requests at the library I work at.  Unfortunately I feel that the 3 books could have been written in one.  I do think the idea had possibilites but it became very tedious reading the third volume  and I ended up skipping much of it.  There was no real story.  Seems the author is laughing all the way to the bank though. Good for her.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Picked this up when it was the FAOTD. Just finished playing it (been off &amp; on for a bit). It's a great game if, like me, you would rather wind down with something low key. Find-the-item, puzzles &amp; spot-the-difference games are connected by a story of a town taken over by paranormal activity.<br /><br />There's a timed mode too, if you like to match your wits with others (via Facebook) . But you don't have to, which gets a big thumbs up from me. Great game, was sorry to see the end of the story!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Not the best game I've downloaded but certainly nit the worst.  PLAY RESPONSIBLY! The hardest part was ending the game.  The exit is hidden under options next to About.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ive played in awhile although a little addicting<br />I would not have guessed it would be so fun
B00884GR0W|3.0|Personally, I think that this game is just a knock-off of minecraft. Sure it has better graphics, but the other reviews don't focus on gameplay. It has a world limit, unlike our current minecraft game. And pointless quests. Although I must say, this game has some fun in it and is more realistic than Minecraft. Watch out for bears!
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I've used the MP3 app since it was released. I now have about 90% of my music collection in Amazon Cloud. The player and streaming service are nice. However, the downfall of this app is the inability to store media and data on the SD card.<br /> Recent Android phones have a tiny amount of internal storage, especially after carriers add their apps. Amazon MP3 adds to the persistent headache by not taking advantage of external storage.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome and i truely love it! it gets harder as it goes along so if you don't like a challenge don't get this app...
B000002KCI|5.0|I thought I knew all Neil Young's songs, but I just heard some new ones on this CD, and I love them.  I bought this CD just for Cortez the Killer (one of the best guitar solos ever), and I happily received some new great songs along with it.  Yay.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|This book looked promising after Matched, but kinda let me down. I felt like reading it was a chore until it was almost finished. Don't get this is if you are looking for anything special. I am definetly not pre ordering reached.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|What is there to really say about these two? They are nothing short of fantastic games but mind you that they are not for everyone.<br /><br />The following may contain spoilers.<br /><br />Ico is a wonderful tale of a seemingly ordinary boy who's put under extraordinary circumstances. Solve puzzles and live out a beautiful story of honest and simple friendship. Early in Ico's adventures he encounters a strange young woman whom he must protect and guide. When I say guide, I don't mean that figuratively. Ico generally needs to take her by the hand and lead her to the next location, but every so often she'll take initiative and run after something interesting. This is a very puzzle oriented game, so don't expect high action or anything like that.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus is in fact a prequel to Ico, this time following a young man who seeks to save his loved one by making a deal with the god of death. To do so he must defeat massive beasts, the Colossi, who are puzzles of their own, with vast sweeping landscapes and beautiful adventures along the way, culminating in the most epic and climactic battles between man and mountains. Every encounter is new and a challenge to solve, not just win.<br /><br />As for this HD rerelease, the graphics are quite stunning. They will not match a new game today by any means, but this is a wonderful addition to my collection. If you've played either of these before, I highly recommend buying this set.<br /><br />P.S. THE COVER IS REVERSIBLE! The original Ico art on the front, Shadow of the Colossus on the back. The 'standard' box art shown here is really not that exciting.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Typical &quot;free&quot; game where you're going to be very slow in progressing unless you spend real money for game money.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|great app eveey one should get it once i tried it never went back to the other picture edits apps &lt;3
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Good story, but a little over the top on believability.  It kept me interested, and I looked forward to lunchtime every day to read it.  I have to admit that I read past lunchtime a few times because it really had a hold on me.  I recommend this trilogy.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|The DVD arrived in excellent condition.  It was used by our 2012 ILAC Summer Program in the Dominican Republic.  Thanks.
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading the 50 Shades trilogy I started hearing about this book.  Finally had a chance to read it this weekend and I have to say, I think I liked it better! Although the books are a LOT alike, at least to me, and the characters are VERY similar, I think I would take Gideon over Christian.  I wasn't disappointed with this book and I'm looking forward to the next one!
B001TH16DS|3.0|I really love this Season of Star Trek but I really the sound of the enhanced and the original version of the blu rays. But at least, unless the season one in dvd, the blu ray disk make us choice if we want to watch it with the enhanced effects or the original ones. So, despise the sound, the blu ray version is better than the dvd version.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Interesting but predictable moralistic tale of the future.  Written on a middle school reading level it is a fast read with enough twists and turns to be enjoyable.  Appropriate for teens and older.  JC[[ASIN:B004XJRQUQ Hunger Games Trilogy]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is is one of a kind. should be a download for all. I give this app a 5 star rating...but who am I just one guy..read the other reviews
034580404X|5.0|I could not put any of these books down.  Phonomenal from beginning of 1 to end of 3.  Suggest everyone who likes to read something a little risque must read this trilogy.  Most fun I've had reading books in a while.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I like full size, over the ear, big ugly headphones.  I also like listening to music on my laptop and Walkman.  I like it loud so I use a headphone amp.  I needed a new one because my $100 unit became unusable and I was not going to spend another $100 so I bought this FiiO E5.<br /><br />It shipped sooner than I expected.  So I checked it out using my laptop and Walkman and three pairs of headphones (Sony MDR-7506, Sennheiser HD-428S and Sennheiser HD-201).  First, the 7506's don't really need an amp but the E5's bass boost did fill out the sound as these cans are somewhat trebly.  Both the Sennheisers' had improved detail.  In all the E5 was quiet, improved the sound to some extent and the bass boost was useful without being bloated.<br /><br />Concerns?  The connectors on the included cables were difficult to insert into the unit at first but this has improved with time.<br /><br />I am happy with this amp.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this free game is much better than the one I paid for! !  I just got an update that gave me 2 more levels plus more games per level.  love this game you need to get it!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games on this app are great for like traveling and things like that.  I think that some of the games are really lame pr stupid,  but most of them are pretty good.  I would recommend this app.
0060873027|2.0|Buried inside the 400+ pages of Micro by Michael Crichton and Richard Preston, there's a 200 page fast-paced thriller. The challenge for readers is that the extra pages make it very tedious to read. There's the usual Crichton scientific framework providing the basis for the action: in this case, nanotechnology. There's a villain to make the plot interesting. Somehow the pace flagged almost from the start, and I found myself caring less about what was happening, and just wanting to get it over with. Readers looking for something to help the time pass like during an airport delay, are those most likely to overlook the faults of this book and actually enjoy it. For most readers, this book will be tedious or annoying.<br /><br />Rating: Two-star (Mildly Recommended)
B007SYWFRM|2.0|OK, so this is a pretty good game until the reputation task. The friend bug stinks!!!!  If they don't. get this fixed they might as well delete all the tasks that have to do with getting Rep.<br /><br />--J Herbst's son :-)
0446572993|3.0|The complicated plot kept me entertained throughout David Baldacci's novel, The Innocent. The protagonist is Will Robie who works as a professional assassin for the United States. Baldacci often pairs a male protagonist with a female collaborator, and in this novel, it's a fourteen year old runaway. These two characters are smart and competent, and the twisting plot keeps them moving from the beginning of the novel to the end. Fans of thrillers are those readers most likely to enjoy this one.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
0345803485|1.0|I'll make this easy for you.  This is a poorly written romance novel interjected with porn.  One of the worst books I have ever read.  It was written solely to sell books, and as an avid reader, I resent this.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|sonic cd on ipod or on the kindal fire is the same on the Saga cd. it is the best old sonic game.
B006YMLE7G|2.0|It was only $.99 to rent, so I guess I got my money's worth. The graphics and overall plot were decent, but the movie was hard for me to finish. I guess some of the characters were a little over the top for me. Probably more enjoyable for a younger audience, but not kids due to language and adult content, which turned me off.  It was not rated, but should be rated at least 'R\\".
0143119680|5.0|I see this book has attracted several 1 star reviews. It goes to show you can't please everyone. I really enjoyed everything about this book. Both the story and the writing were superb. The author obviously spent much time in research and it shows. This book had me in its grip from page one. I just purchased the sequel and can't wait to read it.
0345803485|1.0|I have never written a review in my life but I want my money back. The biggest load of trash I have ever read. If I want Mills and Boon I would have bought that. There is no hint the in summary of the book that basically it is soft porn with NO PLOT! Utter rubbish
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|My husband, a devout Stephen King fan, turned me on to 11-22-63 by saying these words,\\"it's got romance in it\\". After I completed the huge novel I had to agree, it did have romance in it. But I was also fascinated with the story line which involved time travel and an entertaining history lesson. The romance, when it arrived, was very moving. It won't give anything away by saying that the ending makes all the page turning worthwhile.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|not worth the money i spent all you do is put your little stupid finger and follow it they dont even look like stars dont waste your time and your money on this
B000784WMW|3.0|Of the 5 JEyre's I've seen, this wld rank 3rd.  I saw the complete version,<br />so my review is based on that.<br /><br />Timothy Dalton makes a very good Rochester, but not as good as Michael Fassbender<br />in the 2011 film. The latter provides considerably more dramatic involvement &<br />passion.<br /><br />Zelah Clark 'may' be more the way Charlotte Bronte described her, she's plain, short,<br />etc.  But she seems almost passionless most of the time, & re: her appearance,<br />one has to decide whether to opt for physical description that most closely matches<br />what CB described OR an appearance & performance that was most dramatically involving.  But, worst of all, Clark seems almost passionless which hurts<br />the production, I'd say a great deal.<br /><br />I wld opt for the latter, & I thought Mia Wasikowska's performance in the 2011<br />film was spellbinding, an A plus acting job (meaning she never seemed to be acting).  That made a big difference in making the movie exceptionally dramatically involving & with some extroardinarily passionate/moving scenes.<br /><br />It takes patience & a # of viewing times of two, maybe 3 hrs to watch this version.  But the length of the dvd is also a plus because one sees more detail<br />that CBronte created for the story & characters.<br /><br />Production values are inferior to the 2011 movie & the Masterpiece Theatre<br />version, my lst & 2nd choices, in that order.<br /><br />But, given the length & performances, I wldn't be able to watch this a 2nd time.<br />So you might be better renting it (as I did).<br /><br />- Pete Kossoris;kossoris@roadrunner.com
B00884GR0W|5.0|ok it got 10x better when I found out how to separate things just go to the craft table place a object in u main inventory pick a spot to put it an place it
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This newest movie version (2011) has its flaws, but, of the 5 versions I've seen so far, this is by far the best (& one of the best movies ever)if only because of the<br />sensational performance by Mia Wasikowska in the lead.  She was nominated for the<br />academy award, shld have received it.<br /><br />Tho this version has its flaws, her performance, plus an A- performance by Michael Fassbender in the male lead & an A grade performance by Judi Dench in a supporting<br />role make this a very emotionally involving movie.  The directing,by Gary Joji Fukunaga, based on what one sees on the screen, is outstanding & the sound track superb, setting just the right mood for some of the emotionally charged scenes.<br /><br />Jane is supposed to be 20 years younger (& about 20)than Rochester.  In this case, the principals have in fact a l2 year age difference, greater than in prior versions.  Jane & Rochester are both better looking than descrbed in book & Jane<br />isn't small.  But so what, take the movie on its own terms.<br /><br />Flaws: I didn't like the use of flashbacks, a sequential presentation is/wld be, better.  It ended on a wonderful dramatic note/mood.  Yet I think the film shld<br />provide the info that they married, has 2 children, & Rochester regained the sight in one eye, as in the book.  Why not have the ending as upbeat as the book.<br />This info cld have been conveyed in writing on the screen after the acting portion<br />ends.<br /><br />Also, I wished the movie wld have been longer, quite a bit of the story had to be<br />cut to fit into a 2 hr slot.  Perhaps the home dvd cld have been longer: there<br />are some cut scenes but they don't amount to much.<br /><br />But talk about drama & romantic chemistry & passion on the screen - this movie has<br />it to the nth degree &, even with some flaws, is a masterpiece in my book.<br />Hats off to the participants, esp Ms. Wasikowska.<br /><br />- Pete Kossoris; kossoris@roadrunner.com
055357342X|5.0|SPOILER: Your favorite character dies and its spectacularly frustrating. You'll be aching to read the next book to see how the kingdom fares without him/her.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|This is a good version of 'Jane Eyre', the 2nd best of the five I've seen.<br /><br />None of the top 3 roles are played as well as in the 2011 movie with a knockout<br />performance by Mia Wasikowska, & the direction & musical sound track are not as good.  But all roles are played well, & on the plus side this<br />is over twice as long as the 2011 movie, including aspects of the story that<br />are worth seeing, hearing (I'd recommend getting both these versions).<br /><br />Ruth Wilson makes a good Jane Eyre, delivering what I'd grade as a B plus performance.  Toby Stephens as Rochester gets a B.  That wonderful actress<br />Francesca Annis is given 3rd billing, but she's barely in the story, has onlyl<br />a few lines.<br /><br />Unlike the 2011 movie, the story is shown sequentially, which is good, & makes<br />it easier to follow.<br /><br />Neither lead is as dramatic, magnetic, or charismetic as the leads in the 2011<br />movie, so the emotional highs & lows aren't as great.  But the story, as shown,<br />is always interesting.  The ending is more complete.<br /><br />So I'd recommend this as good entertainment, but lacking the dramatic power of<br />the 2011 movie.<br /><br />- Pete Kossoris; kossoris@roadrunner.com

0307592731|4.0|A friend recommended Wild to me, and I listened to it as an audiobook.  The narrator was quite effective, bringing the details of the author's journey/ordeal impressively to life.  Cheryl Strayed is a masterful writer, conveying in strong and vivid English prose both her emotions and the stresses and triumphs of the tremendous ordeal of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail from Mojave to Cascade Locks.  It was a journey I wanted to listen to and savor every minute of the author's story.  Her predicaments and joys have a familiar and realistic quality I found endlessly engaging.  Even from the perspective of 15 years later, the author has a philosophical viewpoint and a sense of humor that keep you listening.  I can relate to her descriptions of the beauties of the trail, being personally familiar with portions of the Sierra Nevada (Tahoe -- which she skipped), and the Cascades in Oregon.<br /><br />I did find a few issues with the book.  While I understood the author's shock and trauma at the early loss of her mother, I found her repeatedly dwelling on it throughout the book finally boring and wearying to the reader.  I found her egregious mistakes as a hiker on such a quest naive almost to the point of absurdity.  How could an intelligent, educated person put the wrong kind of gas in their camp stove?  How could they carry twice as much weight as a normal person?  How could they discard their major water supply holder hundreds of miles before they knew a predictable supply would be available?  Why didn't she carry pepper spray or mace to protect her from bears or human predators?  Most of all, I could not believe in 1995, Cheryl Strayed could hike for months with never more than $20 in her pocket.  Why didn't she have a credit or a debit card?  Why couldn't she contact her bank or her friends and have money wired to her at her supply points?  That she was penniless on multiple occasions almost seemed to have been made up to make the book more dramatic.  It just made the author seem like a dimwit in contrast to her obvious intelligence -- not very credible.author seem like a dimwit in contrast to her obvious intelligence -- not very credible.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I initially started reading this based on the fact that it was in my \\"Recommended for you\\" list on Amazon, and a few pages into the sample I was already hooked and downloaded the full omnibus edition.  Howey does amazing job of immersing you into the reality of the book; through detailed glimpses into various characters lives, you piece together the very elaborate culture and inner workings of the silo.  Like all good sci-fi, while the setting and background may be outside of our current reality, the characters themselves are very human and relateable.<br /><br />The story moves along at an engaging pace, with a number of suspenseful scenes that left me unable to put my Kindle down no matter how exhausted I was at the time. The character we spend the most time following is a woman who doesn't fall into any of the stereotypes of action / sci-fi heroines- not overly masculine, no running around in high heels for no reason, not a weak little thing always requiring rescue, nor a busty vixen in revealing clothing. She's willful and intelligent, using her troubleshooting skills gained from a career in mechanics to work through the situations she finds herself in- and for that I'm sincerely grateful to Howey.<br /><br />I immediately downloaded book 6 after completing 1-5 and am now moving on to Howey's other books. I'm very glad to have happened upon this author.

0618918248|5.0|The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins, Bantam Press (Transworld), 2006, 406 ff.<br /><br />There have been so very many reviews of this book that I feel I have little to add. As the title implies, it is about the concept of God as imaginative fantasy - an idea that is finding increasing acceptance amongst Christian clergy in Britain (Bishop John Robinson) and America (Bishop John Shelby Spong). There are many other examples in Britain (such as Anthony Freeman, Don Cupitt) and I'm sure others in America. For these men, Man has created God in his own image rather than God creating Man in His image. Richard Dawkins was Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University when this book was written.<br /><br />As well as dismissing the idea of God, Dawkins points up the vacuity of scripture as a wholly human enterprise - an idea again supported by many clergy and one that is rationally sound. He also regards the indoctrination of children with one specific religious view as intrinsically evil. He dismisses the idea that our sense of morality drives in any way from belief in a deity. He does however accept that religion (however illusory) provides comfort to many people but, unlike many atheist authors who followed him, Dawkins does not ascribe all the world's evils to religion. It is fundamentalism that Dawkins really rails against rather than any kind of religion, which he thinks may have evolved as a Darwinian contribution to survival or as a meme.<br /><br />This is an extremely well argued and wittily written book - see, for example, the description of Pope John Paul's survival of an assassination attempt in 1981 (p. 35). The saddest thing is that it will probably be read only by those who are already atheists or at least agnostics. There is a good list of reference books, notes on items in various chapters and a quite detailed index.<br /><br />Howard Jones is the author of The Thoughtful Guide to God<br /><br />[[ASIN:0446697966 God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]<br />[[ASIN:0060778423 Eternal Life: A New Vision: Beyond Religion, Beyond Theism, Beyond Heaven and Hell]]ow Religion Poisons Everything]]<br />[[ASIN:0060778423 Eternal Life: A New Vision: Beyond Religion, Beyond Theism, Beyond Heaven and Hell]]

0062060562|4.0|Very interesting read! I feel very badly for people who suffer from amnesia...... which is what this book was about........ to the extreme. I thought a different ending through 3/4's of the book........ and then the last 10 pages or so, were BAM! Never saw it coming! Do not read this book before bed...... you will NOT be able to put it down and go off to sleep! Highly recommend to fans of page turners!

0307594777|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who Played with Fire, and The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest all make-up the trilogy that is deemed \\"The Millennium Series\\" by Steig Larson. I've read all three books and I've seen the first film based on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It has taken me quite some time to sit down and write this review for two reasons: 1) I wanted to write it on the entire trilogy, although now I'm not sure why I wanted to do that and 2) I find it difficult to actually put in words the genius of the stories Steig Larson wrote. Yes, genius.<br /><br />Nowhere in literature have I met a character I enjoyed reading about as much as I enjoyed Lisbeth Salander, the protagonist and awesome kick-ass main character of the Millennium series. I want to be her, not all of her because let's face it, she's down-right crazy sometimes, but I find myself drawn to her character in a connective way; I want her to be real and alive and hacking into computers for me because I'm important enough for her to care about. The depth of feeling and emotion with which Steig Larson portrays her is truly amazing. You love her, you hate her, you feel apathy, empathy, and sympathy for her sometimes on the same page. You definitely don't want to piss her off. There's a part of me that's wants to have that kind of power, I think everyone does (don't lie to yourself!), and living it through a book character is the closest most of us will ever come.<br /><br />The main champion of Lisbeth is Mikael Blomkvist (who she often views as the antagonist, but he's not), a brilliant journalist. He finds himself in situation after situation above and beyond the scope of mundane news, and at the center of each tryst is Lisbeth Salander. She is either the hero or the victim, depending on which book you read. I openly admit to having a literary crush on Mikael Blomkvist. And it surely didn't hurt when they cast Daniel Craig in the role for the film.<br /><br />The books read very technically. However, Steig Larson was a technical writer for a magazine in Sweden, where most of the books take place, called EXPO. He wrote this series because at 15 years old, he witnessed a gang-rape of a girl he knew named Lisbeth and spent most of his life haunted by guilt because he did nothing to save her. This book pays homage to this girl, and this is evident by the strength he gives Lisbeth throughout the novels. She is also a victim of rape. But again, do not piss this girl off - there will be absolute hell to pay.<br /><br />In book one, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, we meet Lisbeth and Mikael. Mikael is in trouble over a libel lawsuit and is found guilty. In order to escape his life, he takes an assignment abroad for the Vanger family to write a memoir, but everything is not as it seems. Henry Vanger has really hired him because of his astute ability to uncover details others miss and he wants to solve a cold-case murder. This is where Lisbeth enters the story - she becomes his researcher, because she is the best. But, there are strings to cut in getting her help. First off, she is under government sanctioned legal guardianship because she's been declared mentally incompetent and dangerous. Her guardian, Holger Palmgren, suffers from a stroke and unfortunately Lisbeth's care is entrusted to a real prick, Nils Bjurman. But don't worry - she takes good care of him. Through a series of twists and turns, Lisbeth and Mikael form an unbreakable bond, at least for Lisbeth who for the first time in a long time, allows herself to become close to a man. Sadly, Mikael is a bit of ladies man and her heart is shattered.<br /><br />In book two, The Girl who Played with Fire, we learn more about Lisbeth's life before she met Mikael Blomkvist. The book opens with a disturbing kidnapping scene from Lisbeth's perspective and through her eyes we see visions of her throwing a milk carton of gasoline into a car and setting it on fire. This plays over and over in her mind. While she is financially stable and quite aloof now, thanks to some business in book one, she can't shake the revenge she feels necessary to take upon the man that ruined her life - her father. Blomkvist finds himself involved in another high profile case with two new friends, but when he finds them murdered in cold blood one night and the police list Lisbeth Salander as their prime suspect, their lives are intertwined again. It's always a life or death situation with these two, but then again, that's what keeps you turning page well into the night. It is Blomkvist's attention to the little things as a journalist that becomes key in saving Lisbeth Salander's life. But, it's only fair - she saved his life in book one.<br /><br />In the final book, The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, the reader is drawn in immediately to the slow and painful recovery of Lisbeth Salander. We begin in a hospital, where Lisbeth's life hangs in the balance and all I kept thinking as I was reading this book was \\"Don't you dare kill this girl - don't you dare!\\" I can't tell you if I'm angry at the author or not - you'll have to read and find out. However, I can say that in the final book, every person that has ever cared about the very difficult and troubled Lisbeth Salander comes out of the wood-works to try and save her, and to clear her name. It's a tribute to the value of respecting another human being and the ultimate fight for justice in a corrupt and cruel world. The plot is tricky and you really have to READ this book, little things make a big difference.<br /><br />This is not a series to read for the faint of heart or the lazy of mind. It takes a keen eye and interest in the characters and the story to continue on to each destination. This is a grown-up book, and people that lack life experience I believe will have difficulty following the story line. Larson was somewhat criticized for his overly intricate plot, yet he did not live to hear these comments. He suffered a heart attack and died in 2004.  All three books were published posthumously in 2005, 2006, and 2007 respectively.e she is financially stable and quite aloof now, thanks to some business in book one, she can't shake the revenge she feels necessary to take upon the man that ruined her life - her father.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of those books that once you pick it up it is very hard to put down.  The writing is wonderful and thought provoking, once finished you will have to purchase the third book to see how it all ends.  The characters stay with you for a long time.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I have had this CD for 2 years and just bought another for a gift.  This is the best CD ever if you like to listen to music and musicans from around the world.

B004QL7K6G|3.0|I dont watch regular TV, so i dont know nothing about Jennifer Aniston and the<br />others except Alan Alda (MASH). Twas great to see him again...got a little older as<br />time passes on.<br />So when i rented this movie, i already seen the preview, and there was something to<br />like...hippies...commune...drugs ...great mix for a movie.<br />  Usually when a movie has a RESTRICTED label, there is something worth restricting.. but in here we have a male walking around in the nude, and some not<br />very attractive females near the end......but open up your tv and people die with<br />bullets in their heads...and bodies get chopped up...but show a bit a flesh and<br />a few swear words....the whole world might come down....very sad state of society<br />indeed.<br />So back at this movie....fun movie....a few situations...a few wacko characters<br />different that others and filmed in the great outdoors gives it more quality.<br />Is is the best...no ...is it fun...yes....will i watch it again....yes.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun app filled with lots of games it has helped me get through a lot of trips
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Game Not formatted correctly. One column completely cut off. Didn't fit my screen.  I have a RAZR.  Will uninstall immediately.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  20 minutes into it I was ready to turn it off, in fact 20 minutes in took a lifetime!  The story was stupid and just didn't really have any meaning.  I wanted to turn it off and thought...well it's got to get better.  Nope totally wrong!  I gave it one star because you have to but in my opinion it shouldn't get any stars.  I want a refund!!  Please don't waste your time or money.
B007R9MFPU|3.0|Not enough keyboards for me. The distant piano sounds great but it's overused. Not enough guitar and synth work, aka Vienna. This is much better than their previous effort. Looking forward to the next if there is a next.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|This film was incredible! I love the twist to old nursery rhymes and fairy tales.  The story line is truly original with familiar origins.
0062197258|5.0|Alternating chapters between the present time in which the victim is dealing with the post traumatic syndrome and the past in which the violence and abuse took place were effective in bringing the reader's nervousness to a height that cumulates to the end.  An enthralling read.
1878424777|5.0|I would highly recommend this series to anyone. I love love love it! It was nice to have the book along with the cd so that I could listen to it in the car as well.
B002VECMAE|4.0|I really liked this movie. Most realistic movie about Special operations that I have seen in a while. It may seem far-fetched, but it's really not.
B0063B2C5G|5.0|I have never been as addicted to any television show ever!!!! Bones and Boothe make you day dream that a relationship such as theirs is possible. When they look at each other you get chill bumps from just looking in their eyes.They are so refreshing and all of the characters in the series are so compatible. They compliment each other so well!! I sat yesterday and had the best time watching episodes 90-129. It would be just fine if my television played only Bones episodes..That would sustain me. Before Bones, I would turn my T.V. on for news and weather, that's it!! All of the characters are just wonderful!!! They make me laugh and cry. How clever is it to create a show that at times can be so depressing, but you always leave knowing that Bones and Boothe will never sign off without leaving you with the warmest feeling that everything will be o.k. Five stars to the writers, producers and Fox for letting us share such a wonderful hour of entertainment.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|Rented it and didnt expect much. Needless to say, I was disappointed in my choice for bad movie night as this movie is very good.  You need to watch it and just listen and watch.  The narration is excellent as is the art rendering of certain events of the movie.  It moves along pretty well and is just a decent zombie flick.  The effects are really good and I just enjoyed it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so simple but so much fun especially when you get to the bigger boards warning you will lose track of time playing this addictive game
B004DK5CYM|5.0|This movie immediately jumped up near the top of my list of favorite movies. The thing is, all of my other all-time favorites were made in the 40s, 50s, and 60s! So, what makes this movie so good?<br /><br />Well, if you don't know anything about Secretariat, you could easily look at the cover and see a picture of a horse and a Disney logo and politely decline. Thankfully, I at least knew Secretariat was real, and I thought I'd give it a try. I was blown away! The acting is good, the photography is good, it's clean and family-appropriate, and the story? Hmmm...I better leave the story for you to watch!<br /><br />Seriously, now one of my top ten favorite movies, this is the classic Disney treatment to a real-life sports fairytale (comparisons: [[ASIN:B000068DBE The Rookie (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000CNFC76 The Greatest Game Ever Played]]). I highly recommend this--whether you know the story or not. I've watched it a few times, and I still can't believe it!
B007MAETA8|4.0|Loving me some JM, however this CD is good and I suggest you buy it but not his best. Wasn't really feeling the few songs that sound just a bit too country for me. Queen of California is awesome but not sure about the whiskey song. Something like Olivia is my fav.. Suggest the purchase and believe me JM never lets you down. You are bound to play the CD alot!<br /><br />Bonus:<br />He is freakin HOT STUFF, long or short hair! WHAT A BABE!
B000QR4WO2|3.0|The individual songs are fantastic, but the concert is arranged horribly and the lead-out from one song and the lead-in to the next in several places is harsh, diminishing the overall value of this product.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I purchased 2 sets for my family. Expecting the classic \\"maximum coverage\\" screen protectors that normally include protection for all areas of the iPhone, including the side panels, I instead received the new \\"\\"full body\\" screen protector that only provides coverage for the front and back panels. Although I received a refund from AMAZON, I tried to contact the seller to repurchase the CORRECT item I was expecting. The seller chose to ignore my request, even after explaining that I had purchased ANOTHER item from them the day after the first order.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Beautiful UI, numerous and great functions. It offers a nice environment to create some imaginative edits. I haven't had any problems with the app on my Droid X.
B005HSL626|3.0|it's a good game for the most. I love playing it and it's addictive. But after a couple weeks of playing it it would not open! If u want the game it's a good game just expect in a while it wont open up.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|title says it all. this game is additive! begins very easy, each level gets a little harder. I think the hardest are the ones where you have extra spaces.
B00824ZJ84|4.0|I had not heard of Rebecca until a friend told me about her today. I immediately downloaded the album and I relly like.  A previous review likened her to Randy Crawford; I agree.  I also think she has a Helen Terry vibe.  I recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just love this series.  I am just about done with book #3 and I will be very sad to say goodbye!  The characters are great.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is very straight forward and fun. It can be challenging because of the lag but besides that I think this is a must buy!
B003L1ZXCU|1.0|Even if Mr. Suarez himself paid me to, I would never read another one of his books<br /><br />I'll join the chorus and say that I bought this because of Leo Laporte's glowing recommendation. I first started reading this last year when it came out and quickly lost interest. But, because of a recent podcast and Leo's continuing admiration, I thought that I had missed something and probably just needed to dive in a little more. Not so. There are four or five moments where I was honestly embarrassed that I was reading this drivel and hoped that no one would walk in while I was.<br /><br />In addition to the completely unnecessary and look-at-how-smart-I-am \\"technical\\" spooge, comes an inane, obsessive focus on race and an adolescent attempt at including every race just to get a better grade from the teacher. Honestly, I can't believe this made it to print/audio. I had to laugh when new situations where something technical was happening arose. Suarez is obviously so impressed at his own technical knowledge that explanations are overly complicated recitations, seemingly straight from Websters.<br /><br />Finally, if you are a parent, DO NOT let your children read this book. Beside it being a ridiculous waste of time, it is also depraved and has the worst, pornographic scene - involving a drugged, underage girl and a group of men at a rave - that I have ever encountered in a book. It is such an unnecessary attempt at being edgy that it pisses me off.<br /><br />For a better read, pick ANYTHING written by ANY adolescent with an IQ over 75... Ever. Seriously. This is just awful.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I have read the first two books and can't wait for the third. I purchased the downloads and store on a kindle which I am very pleased with.

1594135851|4.0|Not quite as good as the first, and a little repetitive, but it was still really good. Looking forward to the next one because I've heard it switches things up more.
B000051Y0G|4.0|After 25+ years of ignoring this album (I originally bought it back in 1984, gave it a few spins, then never bothered to touch it again) I recently got the CD and was pleasantly surprised how well \\"She\\" holds up.<br /><br />The intriguing thing about rediscovering Cyndi's debut effort, is that it's the lesser-known tracks that appeal to me more this time around. That may be because Adult Contemporary radio and the muzak system at work have played \\"Time After Time\\" and especially \\"All Through the Night\\" so many times they seem as ubiquitous as the National Anthem.<br /><br />\\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\" suffers from almost the same overexposure, being a staple of retro '80s radio ever since that decade's renaissance began in the early 2000's. Of all the hits here, \\"She Bop\\" is the most pleasant to revisit because it's sort of been hiding away for awhile.<br /><br />The underappreciated \\"Money Changes Everything\\" kicks off the album and Cyn delivers perfect resignation as she tells her old lover \\"there's one thing we weren't thinkin' of--and that's money\\". The Ska-flavored \\"Witness\\" is another winner as well as schizophrenic-sounding \\"I'll Kiss You\\" and Prince-penned \\"When You Were Mine\\".<br /><br />The production is all totally-awesome-80s to be sure, but unlike the terrible filler on Madonna's \\"True Blue\\", Cyn's album cuts here are still well-written little gems even if they do sound terribly dated. Most important, Lauper lives up to her mantra here as she really does sound like she's having fun throughout this collection.<br /><br />FOUR STARS and worth dusting off again.

0307352145|4.0|I was a big fan of Susan Cain's blog before I knew she was writing Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Won't Stop Talking.<br /><br />Stumbling across her work online made me feel like I was eavesdropping on my long-lost tribe. It was my little secret. And then, I told all my other introverted friends, because I thought it might make *them* feel less alone. And then I realized how many introverted friends I had and I was like, \\"Hey...\\"<br /><br />My therapist did not disagree with me when I happily declared the I-word as my new label, but she did look at me with slight disbelief. I have thousands of friends online. In real life, I have hundreds. I say this not to brag but to express how weird it was for me to suddenly be outing myself as some kind of person who doesn't like people. Because that's the stereotype about introverts. We must be misanthropes.<br /><br />As a newly proud introvert -- like Albert Einstein (you think he would mind if I called him Al, now that we have that whole introverted thing in common?), Steve Wozniak, Gandhi (GANDHI!?) -- it was a relief to read that you can own enjoying time to recharge but also express your extrovert self in service of the things you believe in deeply. To make the world better. In other words, when you're passionate about something, like, say, people not beating themselves up for being single in a world full of couples (ahem), the extroverted stuff comes out or takes less energy.<br /><br />What a freaking relief! The whole blog. The whole concept. The whole damn book.<br /><br />It soothed me to finally have this deeply researched, wonderfully written book as my new manual for explaining why I need so much time to recover after a party.<br /><br />Why I want to hide in the bathroom after I've been standing in front of folks talking for longer than 30 minutes. (Harvard University introverts do this, Cain writes. My people!)<br /><br />I thought there was something wrong for me for years, so it was with suchjoy and solace that I devoured Cain's reportage that I had to physically restrain myself from laughing, crying, gently tapping the shoulder of the person next to me on an airplane to say, \\"She gets me.\\"<br /><br />Here are snippets of what I learned:<br /><br />The Cult of the Extroverted Ideal began with Dale Carnegie, who also contributed to a self-help empire that is today an $11 billion-dollar-a-year industry {Me and my talented writer friend Diana Dee Dash Bee wrote about that self-helpy thing for Bitch Magazine a couple of years ago.)<br /><br />Extroversion is less prevalent in Asia and Africa than in Europe and the Americas in part because the latter nations are nations of migrants.<br /><br />Women were taught to be demure, men to be salespeople<br /><br />Tony Robbins seminar descriptions sound like a nightmare for an introvert. She doesn't set him up as a hypocrite, but her description of the scene is reminiscent of Barbara Ehrenreich's Brightsided without some of Ehrenreich's delightful crabbiness.<br /><br />I had no idea that 20 percent of the Fortune 500 were Harvard Business School grads where Cain notes most practically go to the bathroom in teams.<br /><br />I could go on and on. I loved the sweet attention to detail and celebration of introverted people and children in a world that often makes people who are introverted feel like hermetic morons who just need a seminar or two to get right with the world. The book is a great gift to the world, since I think it will help clear up a lot of misunderstood qualities of introverts/extroverts. I have a feeling that only introverts will read it, though, which would be a shame. But if you're not going to buy the book, loud, gregarious, making-me-look-bad people, at least visit the blog once a week. In private. Maybe in a bathroom stall? I won't tell anybody. Introverts know how to keep it to themselves. Wow, can somebody make me a shirt that says that?
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Slumdog Millionaire (2008) is a very good movie with the astounding cinematography, virtuoso directing, and the heartbreaking yet optimistic story. The acting by three main characters especially by a newcomer, Dev Patel, is compelling. Patel plays a street kid Jamal Malik (Patel), an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who made it to the Indian version of the TV show Who wants to be a millionaire?\\" and keeps answering correctly every question. The secret is that every question represents a chapter of his own life, his growing up and surviving on the streets, his adventures and experiences often dramatic and even tragic. When he is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees (around $450,000), the time is up, and millions of TV-viewers who root for Jamal would have to wait for the following night to see him go for the big prize. Jamal is arrested by the police right after the game and he will spend the next day been rather brutally interrogated by police officers who want to find out how the street boy with no education can answer the difficult questions correctly. Fifteen years from the lives of Jamal, his older brother Salem and another orphan from the slums of Mumbai, \\"the third musketeer\\", the girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto), Jamal's true love since their childhood will reveal in flashbacks, and by the end of Jamal's story, it won't surprise us why he knows all answers. IMO, the only weak point in the story was the big 20 million rupees question. I won't reveal it but trust me, the whole reading or movie watching world knows the answer, and the question was too easy for such high stake BUT it fits the story very well, so I tend to be lenient.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is IMO the look at India from within, the glorious views of India's beauty and horrifying captures of its unspeakable poverty, from the slums of Mumbai and the dizzyingly crowded streets of Bombay to the heavenly magnificent Taj Mahal.<br /><br />Boyle's directing very much reminds Fernando Meirelles inspiring movie-making in Cidade de Deus aka City of God by its dynamism, fast and furious camera movements, and amazingly deep and compassionate understanding of the materialy much reminds Fernando Meirelles inspiring movie-making in Cidade de Deus aka City of God by its dynamism, fast and furious camera movements, and amazingly deep and compassionate understanding of the material
0307957837|5.0|I've read this series I think four times now (just finished it again). I can confidently say that it's right up there as one of the best books/series I've ever encountered. The characters, universe(s), theme, story arc and writing style are all amazing. It's written in a clear, easy to follow, engaging and simple manner that really draws you into the story. The characters are loveable and flawed in their own ways and behave like real people would when presented with their situation. The theme is controversial, and doesn't really become obvious until the second book. Pullman takes issue with organized religion and it shows; especially when it comes to dogmatism and using religion as a tool of power over the lives of others. Many here and elsewhere seem to take a lot of issue with that. I would argue that anyone, of any religion, should read these books because they bring up a lot of good points that can be intelligently discussed. It is doing what C.S. Lewis did in the Narnia books, just for a different world view that isn't the normal. I argue that everyone, especially members of organized religion, should read these books because they are challenging. Everyone should entertain and think about ideas outside of their own belief system. How can we truly grow if we stay blind and uninformed to all challenges to our beliefs? That's what this book (or these books) do, challenge the commonly held belief system in the western world while being entertaining.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|Finally, the day has arrived and I can happily say that I've lived to see something that I almost lost my hope to see - a truly original, clever, beautiful, creative, funny and moving, modern Romantic Comedy. I am happy to write these two words in capital letters. Nothing is new in this world. It is impossible to come up with the new plot about love or possibility of love, or expectation of love or losing it but it is possible to look at the old story with a fresh eye and make the movie as enchanting as 500 Days of Summer.<br /><br />The first time director Marc Webb has started on a very high note. His movie is so charming (I know I use this word a lot but it describes 500 days perfectly). It combines many different techniques and succeeds adorably in following two leads and their 500 days of getting together and gradually drifting apart. It is rarely I see the movie which makes me smile from the beginning to the end. I felt like that big silly grin was glued to my face and I did not mind. It is nothing Webb did that I have not seen before - broken narrative,jumping back and forward in time, using the split screen technique (which makes the best scene in the film with many memorable scenes), inserting a musical number that seems to come from a Bollywood movie,changing the real world into animation. Yes, I've seen this all before but all together these tricks have mixed in something magical, delicately bitter-sweet and funny without being stupid, loud, vulgar, and pushy. The big part of the magic is with no doubt an undeniable palpable chemistry between two leads, both known for their previous performances in the independent movies. Joey Deschanel (Summer) was the best part of All the Real Girls (2003). As for Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Tom), I believe he is becoming one of the best actors of his generation. Few years ago I wrote about his performance in George Araki's Mysterious Skin, \\"Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is simply the shining star of the film and I'll make sure from now on to check out all his new movies\\". I am glad that I check this movie. It has generated a lot of positive reviews, and it deserves them. Time will tell but I think 500 Days of Summer may become Annie Hall for the modern time. Yes, I believe it is that good. There were few things that I did not like very much, for example a clich&eacute;d smart-alecky rather annoying character of pre-teen sister of Tom. But the entire movie is so good that I don't want to nit-pick and I recommend it highly.<br /><br />P.S.

0345803485|1.0|Okay I'll admit it, I read a fair amount of romance novels, I don't expect them to have award winning plots. This book took a lack of plot to a whole new level. I can see some of the inspiration from Twilight that everyone is talking about, but this book was Edward stalking taken to an even deeper level, accompanied by grammar and image/word overuse that was WAY worse than even Stephanie Meyer could produce.<br />The blatant sexism displayed in these books was shocking to me. Don't women want strong role models that display a woman's sexuality as power. Even if we secretly want a dominant man in the bedroom the way Christian treats Ana while in public is in my view unacceptable. This book shows women that it's okay to compromise their ideals when a hot billionaire wants to have sex with you. I'm not morally opposed to the BDSM lifestyle, if that's what people choose but that's not what was presented in this book. (SPOILER Ana didn't really choose it, it just sort of happened one step at a time)<br />I read an article on Yahoo that compared this book to Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights. That made me laugh so hard. The fact that this book made it to the best seller's list makes a sad commentary on the reading material of the general public.(I do include myself in this) I really hope that is isn't the only book that avid fans are reading this year.
B001TODCII|4.0|It's been a long time since I watched an action movie and was so involved, riveted to the screen, and rooted so much for the main character as when I saw last weekend the thriller Taken (2008) written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel. As the action movies go, this is very entertaining and dynamic picture.<br /><br />The plot involves the kidnapping of an American girl (Maggie Grace) vacationing with a friend in Paris, by the gang of Albanian human traffickers specializing in selling young women into forced prostitution. Her estranged father Bryan (Liam Neeson), a retired CIA agent, the member of the elite \\"Special Activities Division\\" Black operations is on the phone with his daughter at the very moment of kidnapping and he's got just a few days to find out who is behind the crime and to try to get his daughter back before it is too late. If you've seen the trailer for the movie, the Neeson's close up and his short but convincing speech addressed to the invisible unknown man who is listening to his daughter's cell phone, tell you everything you have to know: \\"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.\\" The film follows this statement closely, and makes it a really fast running 93 you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long minutes. The plot is anything but new - back in 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger as retired elite commando had only a few hours to find and rescue his daughter from an exiled dictator. The first and by far the best season of hit TV series 24 had Kiefer Sutherland as LA based CTU Agent Jack Bauer chasing of all sorts of terrorists who taken his teenage daughter. In its bets moments, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics. Another thought came to my mind while watching the movie, if ever Liam Neeson was considered for the part of Bond, James Bond? If not 007 himself, he could have easily been s Bond's older brother, less glamorous but as dangerous and deadly.<br /><br />Taken touches on horrific but sadly existing and blooming business of international women trafficking, the slave trade of our times. Do not expect the movie make some serious social comments or provide the deep insight into the dirtiest business possible. Neeson's hero is not out to save thousands of lost forever young women, he is trying to find and safe one girl only who just happened not to know how lucky she was to have a deadly killing machine for a dad. I don't recall when was last time I felt as satisfied as when Bryan let disgusting and despicable villains of different social standings have it with great vengeance and furious anger. I saw perfectly clear all movie's weaknesses and clich&eacute;s while I was watching it but it never bored me, it was non-stopping action, and it had a hero whom I desperately want to succeed. Perfect or not - I liked Taken a lot and would recommend it without hesitation.ts, Taken brings as much excitement and adrenalin as these classics.

0345803493|1.0|So I read Fifty Shades of Grey. I knew as I was reading it that it was terrible, yet I made it to the end. I thought okay cliffhanger ending and the second book MUST have gone through some sort of editing process right? Wrong. The beginning completely wigged me out because Ana must have some sort of personality complex or immensely low self esteem. Then it just got worse.<br />I like books with sex in them, but COME ON nobody has that kind of stamina. They have sex all the time. It also got so repetitive. The author must have hired Stephanie Meyer's editor because as so many reviewers before me have pointed out, there is only so many times you can use the word flush, bite your lip and have \\"twitchy palms\\"<br />I didn't go into either of these books expecting great literature, what I do expect from a published book is the presence of an editor.

Nowhere Fast also appears on Meatloaf's 1984 \\"Bad Attitude\\", but this version is very different and better.  I also like Sorcerer and Never Be You.  Great album.

B00571F26Y|2.0|Let me start by stating that I am not overweight - in fact, couldn't stand to lose more than 2 or three pounds.  But I do have belly fat around the middle that has been nearly impossible to lose - despite lots of exercise and ab work.  I read this book because I know lots of folks with celiac or other gluten intolerance and I thought maybe I should learn a bit about it and find out if it might help with my belly fat.  The author's insight into the rise of gluten intolerance due to the genetic modification of wheat is very interesting, and I fully believe the the connection between wheat and the intolerance that these folks suffer.  However, I have none of these issues.  By the end of the book I realized that, in order to lose belly fat, the author advocates you to cut out carbs, not just wheat - limit your intake of legumes, fruit, rice, potatoes, and everything carb.  Eat meat, chicken, fish, eggs, nuts and vegetables.  Sound familiar? Sure, if you do this, you will probably lose weight, but let's not blame it on the wheat gluten.  Call it what it is - paleo, low carb, Southbeach, Atkins.  You name it - it's nothing new.  If you are not having wheat/gluten intolerance issues and don't have weight issues, then this book is largely useless.  However, I would agree if you are having issues that you can't identify the root of, try going off wheat for a few weeks and see what happens.  Lots of folks rave about the results.  My personal experience is that I went off wheat for 8 days.  The first few days were fine, nothing out of the usual- I don't crave wheat, so it was essentially a non-issue.  But after a few more days, I got bloated and gassy, and gained 4 pounds!  I started eating wheat again, and voila, lost the four pounds, bloating went away and all is fine.  Just thought I'd share the other side.

B006XF5BTG|4.0|I was ready to go to the gym and eat smart. I just needed the tools to begin. I bought this and am very pleased. This book is great for a couple of reasons.<br />1. It calls out the B.S. that marketing campaigns use to sell their product to people that think there is a \\"secret\\" that ripped people know and they don't. The \\"secret\\" is that there is no secret. It takes hard work, both in the gym and at home. This book breaks down the art of gaining muscle mass into the simplicity that it is: go to the gym often and don't eat junk food.<br />2. The strategy to call other marketers' B.S. is itself a great marketing campaign. It makes you want to buy his book because he says everyone else is just selling something that doesn't work.<br />3. He breaks the \\"secret\\" down into very simple, easy to follow steps that the lay person can understand and implement.<br /><br />All in all, he covers the major concepts of how to get lean and ripped, debunks the myths that we all secretly know are false but pretend not to know, and he lays out a good step by step work-out and diet regimen that makes following to the letter \\"easy\\". But it is only easy if you are psychologically ready to put in hard work at the gym and follow a strict eating program at home. I was ready, I'm one week into it, I'm 3 pounds down so far, and they just seem to melt away. I recommend this book.

0062206281|5.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon first introduced readers to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books through the enchanting THE SHADOW OF THE WIND. He followed that acclaimed novel with THE ANGEL'S GAME, a magic realism thriller taking place at the end of World War II. It is in no way a sequel to the first book, although the setting and main characters are centered on the family-owned bookstore Sempere and Sons, an historical fixture in the heart of Barcelona. The modest shop has weathered the Spanish Revolution of 1936 and World Wars I and II, surviving tumultuous political and social upheavals. In THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN, we find Daniel Sempere, recently wed and father of a young son, struggling to help his father keep the business alive during a recession in 1956.<br /><br />Daniel's father faithfully retains a longtime friend of the family, Fermin Romero del Torres, who works in the bookstore. Fermin finds himself confronted with a threatening shadow from his past as he fills out paperwork in preparation for his marriage. Keeping a low profile has become a way of life for men of a certain age in post-war Spain, and the country has suffered 20 years of brutality under the boot of dictator Generalissimo Francisco Franco. Daniel knows little about Fermin's past other than he, like other dissidents at the end of the bloody revolution, had paid for his loyalty to the losing side by being shackled in the notorious dungeon fortress that looms above the city. Those who survived (and their numbers were few) were barely able to stagger through the gates, each leaving a part of their sanity and very souls in the infamous torture chambers. None had ever escaped.<br /><br />A mysterious old man, badly crippled, appears at the book shop to purchase a wedding gift for Fermin, who is away for the day. The old man selects a very expensive rare edition of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, enters an ominous inscription on the title page, and signs his name \\"Fermin Romero del Torres,\\" the same name as Daniel's friend. Intrigued, Daniel follows him through the streets of Barcelona to a sleazy hotel in the red light district.  He returns to the store and shows the book to Fermin, who is shaken when he sees the inscription and his own name written by another. Daniel presses him for more details, and Fermin reluctantly confides in him. Times are still very dangerous as Franco retains his fanatical grip on Spain. The fact that this man, who Fermin knows and fears, is still alive and privy to his whereabouts could threaten the bridegroom's life and future family.<br /><br />THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN is the third in a promised four-part saga centered on the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.Zafon writes that none is a sequel to the other and that each novel stands alone and can be read in any order. Barcelona comes vividly, albeit darkly, to life through Zafon's masterful storytelling ability in each of these first three books. One would be mistaken to ascribe any single genre or style to describe each volume, because although the setting and people are the same, none is told in the same manner. It is a testament to Zafon's genius that he doesn't fall into the pit of mimicking himself with each new rendering.<br /><br />The city of Barcelona lends itself to dark themes with its Gothic towers and bloody history.  THE SHADOW OF THE WIND could almost be described as a Gothic novel with its mystery, romance and suspense. THE ANGEL'S GAME, on the other hand, leans toward a psychological, supernatural thriller ala magic realism, while THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN is a historical novel depicting the life and misfortunes of a man who fought on the wrong side of a revolution. Invoking the atmosphere of Dumas, Dickens, Poe and Garcia Marquez, Carlos Ruiz Zafon retains his originality and will hold his rightful place among the storytelling masters of literature.<br /><br />Reviewed by Roz Shea

1250000971|4.0|England is on the brink of war with Germany. The countrymen are tense and poised for battle. The women are scurrying around to protect their lovers, husbands and children. But some people seem to believe themselves above all that, like Hugo Barrington.<br /><br />Hugo couldn't be a more awful man. His father and his grandfather before him built Barrington Shipping Line into a thriving business. The name was synonymous with respect, right up until Hugo got his greedy hands on it. All he cares about is living the life of a rich playboy, replete with fast cars and faster women. Young Hugo must have exuded at least a temporary charm, long enough to win over even the most level-headed of women, because his conquests are many. Thus, when his daughter Emma wishes to marry Harry Clifton, a question arises as to whether Harry could be Hugo's son.<br /><br />With the marriage averted at the altar, Harry joins the merchant marines, hoping to release Emma from her ties to him. When the ship goes down, Harry seizes the opportunity to perish in the tragedy, reborn as American Tom Bradshaw, who died when the Germans sank the ship. But if Harry thought the identity switch would solve all his problems, he was sorely mistaken. Almost immediately upon reaching New York, he is arrested for murder. Some legal shenanigans ensue and Harry ends up in prison, serving Tom's sentence.<br /><br />But Emma is not a young woman to give up easily. She refuses to believe Harry is dead. And she has a special reason to remain steadfast in her belief: Harry's son, Sebastian. With the future so uncertain, she sets sail for America to prove Harry still lives and to let him know he has a child.<br /><br />Back home, Hugo is busy liquidating everything worth a quid in order to keep himself in the manner to which he has become accustomed. The rest of his family avoids him at all cost, possibly hoping that if they ignore him, he'll simply go away. That would be too easy. While many honorable sons are joining the war effort, including Hugo's own son, Giles, Hugo is busy chasing his selfish desires, most of them involving women and booze.<br /><br />Giles will be up for the Barrington title and whatever fortunes Hugo hasn't gone through when the time comes. That is, unless Harry returns home to claim his legacy as Hugo's firstborn --- if it can be proven. But the catch-22 is that Harry doesn't want the title nor anything that comes with the Barrington name. He wants only Emma.<br /><br />THE SINS OF THE FATHER, the second book in Jeffrey Archer's The Clifton Chronicles, is a good old-fashioned war-torn romance that reads a bit like a British \\"Peyton Place.\\" There are some really odious characters, and a few who transcend sainthood. It's a compelling story, if only to see which horrible person gets his just desserts and which hero comes out on top.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kate Ayers

030758836X|5.0|It's Nick and Amy's fifth anniversary. Three years ago, they made the move from their hip New York City condo to an ostentatious yet generic house in the small town of Carthage, Missouri. It was a family necessity. At least that's what Nick keeps reminding Amy. The adjustment hasn't been an easy one. But now it's time to celebrate five years of marriage.<br /><br />Amy always concocts a treasure hunt for her husband, with clues hidden in special places that he must figure out from her cryptic clues. Sometimes they can be more challenging than others, and sometimes they can be more damning too.<br /><br />That morning, Nick gets a call at The Bar, an enterprise he and his twin sister, Margo, have finally taken from a dream to a reality. On the other end of the line, his neighbor informs him that the front door to their house is wide open, and the cat is outside, which never happens. Nick's mood isn't great anyway, and now this. Margo watches him leave with mixed emotions.<br /><br />At home, Nick eases inside, where he discovers signs of a struggle and, ominously, no sign of his wife. What has happened here? The police begin to investigate and, as most people would expect, soon turn their sights on Nick. Amy's little treasure hunt is turning into Nick's worst nightmare.<br /><br />As a former journalist, Nick should have known how his story would look to the public, yet he has a too-calm aspect and comes across as all wrong. Proclaiming his innocence does little to sway anyone, of course, and evidence starts to pile up. Even Margo expresses doubt. Things don't look good for him.<br /><br />In the meantime, readers are treated to Amy's yet-to-be-discovered diary. The entries go back seven years, to the time when she and Nick were dating. She shares how they met, how they played the mating game and how they ultimately got married. Now, in alternating chapters, Nick narrates his tale, then Amy's diary tells hers, at least for Part One, when it changes around a bit.<br /><br />It is easy to like Nick --- that is, until he throws a curve ball into his story. Then, just as you wonder what he meant by that comment and feel the hairs on the nape of your neck start to bristle, he reassures you that he really is a good guy. And Amy? Well, no one is perfect, but in this case, she is Amazing. Her parents are the authors of the famous line of children's books, Amazing Amy. Beautiful, talented, famous, rich and brilliant. Amy Elliott Dunne is all of the above, especially brilliant. So what has happened to her?<br /><br />Whatever you do, don't be lulled into thinking you know what happened until the very last paragraph. By the time you figure it out, you will be gasping, shaking your head, and slapping your temple. You will have been batted around like a ping pong ball in a tight match, and you will feel like you have made just as many turnarounds. The book is, quite simply, ingenious. Gillian Flynn couldn't possibly surprise her readers any more than she has in this amazing thriller. If there ever was a must-read, especially for mystery lovers, GONE GIRL is that. And so much more.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kate Ayers

0062197258|5.0|I love cautionary tales. No, not the ones where the world is going to end because someone drives a car that only gets 36 miles to the gallon on the highway. I mean a real cautionary tale, the type where you bring the wrong person home with you after a night of pub-crawling, or you behave badly because you're spending the night in a different area code, or you accept a ride across a bridge with a U.S. Senator. I hold one in my hand right now, and it's called INTO THE DARKEST CORNER by Elizabeth Haynes. It's a great, keep-you-up-all-night reading and thinking exploration of the dark side of relationships with the wrong person.<br /><br />Haynes is a police intelligence analyst who no doubt has seen the aftermath of the type of situation she writes about here. The tale may be a bit familiar, but it's her presentation and sharply defined characters that will keep you reading. Haynes tinkers a bit with what might be considered the traditional narrative structure, but all to good purpose. The story begins with several pages of a transcript from a 2005 court proceeding and ends with the record of another hearing in 2009. It's the in-between that jumps back and forth in time, and the narrative itself clarifies both.<br /><br />After a brief but chilling introduction, which you will want to remember at all times, the meat of the tale proceeds along two parallel tracks that alternate with each other throughout the book. Each of these commence at a different point in time separated by four years --- October 31, 2003 and October 31, 2007 ---  and then moves forward in jumps of  a varied number of days. It's a bit complex, but each segment is clearly marked by the date, so the reader is easily able to follow what is happening and when.<br /><br />Catherine Bailey is a twentysomething office worker living in London. It becomes clear almost immediately why Haynes has chosen this narrative style to tell Catherine's story, for the woman we encounter in 2003 is far different from theone with whom we renew acquaintances in 2007. Catherine in 2003 is a worker bee by day and a party girl by night, hitting the clubs each evening with her friends and engaging in casual and reckless sexual encounters with wild abandon. It becomes clear in the first account of 2007 that something has occurred in the interim, for Catherine is reduced to moving through each day as a terrorized, insecure soul, wholly given over to an obsessive-compulsive disorder that controls every element of her existence. I have no idea if Haynes has ever been troubled by an OCD, but her description of Catherine's affliction is better than first-rate, as she captures not only Catherine's inner turmoil but also brings the reader into it on an extremely deep level.<br /><br />So what has happened to Catherine? Haynes begins dropping the breadcrumbs to the answer early on, and the path quickly leads to Lee Brightman, a handsome and intriguing gentleman whom Catherine meets while out clubbing with her friends one evening. There is mutual lust practically from  the start, and Brightman slowly but incessantly insinuates himself into every aspect of her existence. At one point, a small but significant and prophetic manifestation of what Brightman will do to Catherine occurs (it involves silverware), and because the reader knows how she is going to wind up, the effect of this knowledge --- and the reader's helplessness --- is devastating.<br /><br />Two things become obvious as the story lines alternate: Catherine somehow extricated herself from the relationship with Brightman, and she is still in some danger from him. It is the resolution of both these situations, and Haynes' exquisitely paced and presented revelations, that keep the reader engrossed, intrigued, and reading, reading, reading.<br /><br />On the strength of this first novel, Haynes is already on my \\"must-read\\" list. INTO THE DARKEST CORNER begs for a film adaptation for many reasons, even if there is no possibility that sucha movie would be anywhere close to being as good as the book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

B0006L16N8|1.0|What the heck is the matter with the deaf people who mix Coldplay? Being an audiophile, I like to be able to hear a clear, clean mix where you can hear all the instruments without distortion. Coldplay's music is great, but you can't hear the delicate intricasise. The comperssion just doesn't stop. I can't stand to listen to it at anywhere near the levels of other bands of the same type.<br /><br />You look up the people who are doing the mixes on the internet, and they are all are talked about in the glowing terms as to there credentials and expireance. Well, I would give anything if they'ed get off the compressors and give me a clean recording that I could actually listen to. I cannot express strongly enough how terrible I think Coldplay music sounds. Yuk!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is an excellent example of why the Kindle is a boon for readers.  Wool is a top-notch story for a bargain price.  If you are searching for your next story, look no further.  I am not \\"well-read,\\" having spent the last decade sitting on a couch watching TV and movies.  This book has changed where I spend my free-time.  Get it!
0345803485|1.0|Words escape me!  This book is so poorly written it is stupefying! It's an unsophisticated  mash up of the worst elements of Harlequin Romances, Penthouse letters to the editor, and Nancy Drew.  The author's over-reliance on Cliff Notes, pop psychology, and Thesaurus is annoying.  Who would think a book with so many sexual episodes be so UN-stimulating!?  Don't waste your money!

B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|I had seen the movie a few years ago, and bought it as a gift for another person.  I decided to purchase it for myself, also.  It's a great story about finding your passion and refusing to allow anyone to stop you from acheiving your dream.  If you aren't familiar with British accents, you will need to listen closely, as it is a Manchester accent used and can be difficult to understand if you're not used to it.  Funny, sad, inspiring.  I highly recommend it.
0307719219|5.0|Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. You will see this saying come alive as the rise and fall of nations throughout history will give you alarming parallels to our own nation. The book educates you about the past and foretells the future. This is a must have book for any students of history, politics, or economics. This is the type of book that makes a perfect gift for collages and those you care about as you want to spread the word and educate others to prepare for a collapse.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|This was a really fun and original twist on the classic hick-swampland horror movie. And it's got our Alan Tudyk from Firefly, so how can you go wrong (don't worry, he's got a similar role). Gruesome allusions to all the classic horror scenes, but in a tongue and cheek way.

030758836X|4.0|I really liked this book and couldn't put it down, but it literally has one of those endings that is painfully unsatisfying, where you scream \\"Noooooooooo, it is NOT gonna end like that!\\". The ending made me angry. The only thing I can compare it to is the ending of the Sopranos. I felt the same type of anger, because you are invested in this story and then you feel shortchanged at the end.<br /><br />However, it was an ending that you couldn't believe, and I have to give the author credit for that, in a world of boring and predictable endings. It does leave it open for an interesting sequel, and it does drive home the author's point in a poignant way, however frustrating it may be to the reader.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This is a fascinating series!  It's always interesting and surprising with a wonderful cast, now stepping out playing multiple roles. The character development and interaction is part of what makes it so good.  Can't wait to buy the next season!
B00066FBQG|4.0|Last night's bargain rack movie was an old favorite, \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. I was delighted to find it on the Wal-Mart five-dollar rack. I remember enjoying this one in the theater when it first came out. Plus I enjoyed the music which came along with it. Well I still feel the same way. It's a very enjoyable movie and I understand it won a bunch of Academy Awards.<br /><br />It's a western-style cops and robbers movie with Newman and Redford being the lovable bad guys who rob banks and trains and always seem to get away with it and are having a good time in the process. Well, finally the heat gets high enough that they are driven out of their preferred Colorado Plateau habitat (near Zion National Park) and end up in Bolivia. There they start all over again and are having a great time until the Bolivian Army puts a permanent damper on it. End of movie.<br /><br />The movie is light-hearted and fun to watch. There's no deep meaning here. Just relax and enjoy the scenery, the music and the story. It has a pleasant flow to it and a little good humor here and there.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B008JAFXOQ|2.0|It is just too sad that such a good story ends up with typical Hollywood spin on current affairs.<br />It feels like producers want to make us all guilty for whatever happening in the world.<br /> The world of teenager, selfish but at least she finds peace at the end. I knew how it ends 40 min. before .<br /> What a waste of good acting.
0439023483|5.0|The easiest way to summarize \\"The Hunger Games\\" is to say that it's a post-apocalyptic combination of \\"Survivor\\" and \\"The Running Man\\" (except with teenagers) with a little bit of \\"V for Vendetta\\" thrown in.  The basic plot revolves around a young girl who is forced to compete in an annual \\"tournament\\" that was instituted as punishment for a failed revolution attempt.  The winner is the one that survives.  The book is a real page turner that does a wonderful job of fully developing its characters in a short period of time.  As much a narrative about human dignity as it is an action-packed story - \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a guilty pleasure that you'll definitely want to read more than once.  One additional thing that I would add...this book has been marketed to young readers for the most part - but this book should definitely be considered a very violent \\"PG-13.\\"  If you think your young child can handle a PG-13 movie, they can probably handle this book - but think it through carefully.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|There is so much to like about \\"The Presidents Club\\" that I need to begin the review with the fact that I heartily recommend this.  I enjoy Presidential politics and stories surrounding the Office of, and thus this book is chalk filled with not only great individual stories, but an interesting through line about how this \\"club\\" began and what it has morphed into today.<br /><br />Yet, the book bogs down at some points, and I feel that those are due only to the authors I(or editor) moving away from their thesis.  This is quite obvious during the section dealing with Nixon's presidency.  They must provide the basis for Nixon because he is a key \\"club\\" figure after his term ends, and he was in office with the lowest, or no, fellow club members - thus his Presidential years are not key to the club itself. What do the author's do?  Take us through Watergate...again...of course.  Now I get, for reasons already described, that this is partly necessary because it informs the latter Nixon years, however for too long during this section I felt like I had accidentally picked up another book as it strays far from the focus of the club.<br /><br />In another example to this is the \\"wrap up.\\"  Of course the authors need to acknowledge that his book is open ended (thus I expect updated editions to arise every four years or so) so how do they wrap it up?  With an intersting anecdote about a dinner with then President Truman, Winston Churchill and other leaders of the time present.  The story is good...but it does not really fit into the book or the theme of \\"The Presidents Club\\" though the authors try to stretch it so.  These are two example of what weakens an otherwise perfect book.  I would have given it 3.5 stars, but without that option gave them the benefit of the doubt.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book! As a mom of 2 young children, it spiced up my daily life. I dont really know why people who are looking for pulitzer prize material even buy these books. I mean seriously, get a clue! If you want good writing and prose, blah, blah, go to a different section in the bookstore.... These books are for entertainment and she did that very well!!!!!
B003BVK36Q|2.0|I'm on a Le Carre kick right now, having read five of his earlier books in the Smiley/Karla series, starting from Call for the Dead to Smiley's People over the last 3 months.  I loved all of those, for their texture and depth, and the fact that Le Carre loved his subject - the nitty-gritty of Cold War espionage, the un-James Bond-like-ness of its practitioners, and so on - so much.  While Le Carre is clearly a fervent anti-Communist, it was always obvious in all his books how troubled he was by the \\"ends justify the means\\" philosophy that both sides of the Cold War seemed to employ - \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\" is the finest example of this theme (in my limited reading).<br /><br />His later novels - some of which I have read before - such as The Mission Song, The Constant Gardener, etc. seem to take the same tack, with neo-colonialism in Africa (The Mission Song, The Constant Gardener) and the War on Terror (this novel) as the latest targets of his ire.<br /><br />Somehow, he doesn't quite pull it off in \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" like I thought he did in \\"The Mission Song.\\"  It reads a bit like a mix between a Jeffrey Archer and a Ken Follett novel for most of the book, with Le Carre only showing up in brief flashes, in the form of a hard-bitten German Intelligence officer who seems like a copy of \\"The Spy...\\"'s Alec Leamas, and in the form of a characteristically terse ending.<br /><br />And even then, it seems like he just lazily lifted the ending from \\"The Honourable Schoolboy\\" and inserted it here, with the appropriate adjustments for time and context.  At least, in \\"Schoolboy,\\" it made sense and hung together amid all the other themes that Le Carre often intersperses his novels with, such as Whitehall bureaucratic intrigue & pettiness, the occasionally fraught relationship between MI-6 and the CIA, etc. Yes, there's no harm in plagiarizing yourself, but it has to work.  Here, it simply doesn't.<br /><br />This dog don't hunt.  Much to my disappointment.  Onto the next one.

0345803485|1.0|I did not list to my better judgment and let the \\"hype\\" get to me. I actually feel more stupid, stupider? (see!) after reading this book. I'm happy for E.L. James and her large paychecks, but ashamed of any publisher or editor who would allow this book to be printed without some major corrections. Our heroine blushes, flushes, gasps and bites her lips when she isn't whining about why our hero is interested in her or what do to about the \\"contract\\" for his BDSM lifestyle. Contrary to what I was told, this is not a BDSM subjected book at all as this subject simply runs in the background of a really poorly written \\"love\\" story. Overall, this book reads exactly like the myriad of fan fictions that live all over the internet.<br /><br />You might be wondering about my title. The word in question when it comes to the first two Fifty Shades books is the word \\"murmur.\\" Now, this may not be the most overly used word in the book, but it used incorrectly the most times. It was so distracting to me that I had to stop reading to collect myself, and not in a good way!<br /><br />Trust me, it isn't not worth the money or time. If you want an easy to read, really not that great love story, read your Twilight books again. If you want an AWESOME BDSM series, go read Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty books.

B00386EZJU|5.0|I've listened to this album many times over and it is nothing short of amazing. All the tracks are beautifully composed and performed.<br /><br />I listen to a LOT of movie/tv soundtracks, and this album ranks very high in my collection.<br /><br />It's a shame that John Powell didn't receive the Oscar for this score. Trent Reznor (of Nine In Nails, scored The Social Network)beat him, and politically, I can understand why.
B003VANOFY|1.0|The reason I'm giving this 1 star is because of the auto shut off feature. If you have no sound coming from your headset, the headset will automatically turn off after a while. There is NO way to disable this. As someone who usually uses speakers and only uses the headset for talking occasionally, it's a huge inconvenience. Half the time when I actually need to talk, the headset has turned off. I was expecting much better from a $130 headset from logitech.
0553573411|4.0|\\"Royal Assassin\\" is a solid continuation in the series. With alot of the set-up and background set, Hobb has more room to get stuck into the story, and I think the quality of her writing has improved with it.<br /><br />The book starts very slow. The first 50 or so pages (my copy of the book is 675 pages long) drag, and cover the events directly after the conclusion of \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\". There's some retconning, as well as a rather lengthy recap of previous events, and the two are worked together so it's necessary to read them. But after that, beginning with chapter three, the story is immediately kicked into gear and the stakes raised.<br /><br />The plot remains a character-driven, with a complementary side of action and plot drivers. Unlike the previous book, however, these other areas are explored in much greater detail, and specific events are given scenes rather than relegated to a paragraph of straight description. There's a simple plot structure beneath, though I think Hobb does a great job of taking the reader away from that; if it annoys you, or the story isn't sufficient to make it less obvious, well, that can't be helped.<br /><br />Likewise, the characterisation remains superb, and also improved. Even though many of the characters are shown as being almost archetypes, there's more to them than that. They're complex, and this is a very subtle thing, almost like trying to picture something that's at the edge of your vision clearly. The depth of these characters and their relationships are conveyed mostly through their interaction. But it's not just that. These characters act and react humanly, rather than consistently or rationally. As a result, I found almost all of the relationships totally believable.<br /><br />Yet still, the clearly drawn good vs evil dichotomy remains problematic. This primarily occurs through the story's main antagonist, and I think it really brings the book down. I half believe this character plausible, but I half don't. Weget some background to their motivations later on, and some depth added to them, as well as an unreliable narrator who is inclined to think of the antagonist unfavourably. On the other hand, the sheer stupidity, cruelty, and selfishness of this character beggars belief. Furthermore, this character has no redeemable traits. These aspects undermine the rest of the characters behaviour, and although plenty of the other actions are accounted for the faults tend to destabilise all else.<br /><br />While I've seen the characters criticised for being too passive, I disagree. I think it's accounted for quite well in the world-building and development of the story, and is at several points directly discussed. Power structures are in place, and there are very real practical considerations for how things unfold. This also serves as an important point of conflict; characters can't simply do as they wish without consequence.<br /><br />The magic systems are further developed. And the ending of this book is much improved over the last (though I wish the epilogue had been cut; gives too much away), and is more emotive, despite being somewhat abrupt. But it's building up to something, and I feel that's one of the main strengths of this book: Hobb tells a relatively contained story, but there's alot of overarching plot movement. I'm really looking forward to the next book.<br /><br />4.5/5
B00005MAM2|4.0|This is one of my SciFi favorites. The only copy I had was the old VHS release and no VHS player. There are approximately one bazillion different releases of this movie and each one is slightly different. In fact they may have made 10 copies for each release and there isn't a single one that is all encompassing. Anyways, this specific DVD is an older Pioneer release the video is interlaced not progressive scan. It has plenty of extras: an interview, images, trailers, Japanese & English dub but doesn't have the old streamline dub. I didn't even know they redubbed it proper until a year ago. I kinda wish I had a copy of it on DVD with the old streamline dub, even though the streamline dub is a bit silly it's triggers a bit of nostalgia. If someone can give me a UPC EAN for a DVD or Blueray with the streamline dub Ill whip that one up too. Otherwise Ill just have to enjoy a decent copy of a great movie without ninja turtle voices and quirky dialogue.

B005LBN7WQ|3.0|Being a UK citizen I've grown up with the full force and dominance of Westlife - 14 UK no1's and 25 overall top tens. I like a lot of others find as great vocalists Shane, Brian and Mark are the group is quite dull and not very charismatic especially when compared to Take That, Blue or Busted. The main problem is around 60 per cent of 'their' content released has been cover versions. Also a lot of their songs are ballads and they over the course of 10 years have lacked the diversity many artists undertake especially after 10 years. They have stuck to a winning formula rigidly and a safety net of classic cover songs (Manillow's Mandy/Collins Against All Odds or Joels Uptown Girl/Abba I Have a Dream) just a brief mention of the many covers over the past decade. A lot more the last 5 years than compared with their first 5. The annoying thing is the original songs are easily their best ie Flying Without Wings, Swear It Again, If I Let You Go and What Makes a Man.<br /><br />Westlife's peak was the first years 99-02 then came 10 years of covers a shame for a group who were genuinely good during those few years. In terms of legacy they won't be regarded like Take That who pushed and challenged genres and codes and conventions of what it is to be a boyband or more acomplished singers like the Backstreet Boys. However their predictability and mechanical approach to releases (namely with no big competition releases in sight to deprive a one week #1 single/album) perhaps is what kept them around for so long. Westlife were good but they could have been great.<br /><br />The group won Best UK and Ireland Act in 2000 at the European Music Awards and Best Pop Act at the first Asian Music Awards in 2002.<br /><br />Westlife also went on to win Best Pop Act at The Brits (UK Grammys) in 2001 and 2002.<br /><br />Fun Fact: Westlife were the first group to have their first 7 singles go to number 1 in the UK but were denied an 8th by that musical giant Bob the Builder!<br /><br />The biggest selling boyband in Britain: 2000, 2001 and 2005.<br /><br />As of 2017 currently the 2nd highest selling boyband in British chart history (behind Take That).<br /><br />Career album/singles sales in UK: 12 million/6.8 million = 18.8 million<br /><br />Disc 1:<br />1.Swear It Again: UK#1 (1st).<br />2.If I Let You Go: UK#1 (2nd).<br />3.Flying Without Wings: UK#1 (3rd).<br />4.I Have a Dream: UK#1 (4th) (Double A side with Seasons in the Sun), Christmas #1 1999.<br />5.Against All Odds: UK#1 (6th).<br />6.My Love: UK#1 (7th).<br />7.Uptown Girl: UK#1 (8th).<br />8.Queen of My Heart: UK#1 (9th).<br />9.World of Our Own:UK#1 (10th).<br />10.Mandy: UK#1 (12th).<br />11.You Raise Me Up: UK#1 (13th).<br /><br />Disc: 2<br />1.Seasons in the Sun: UK#1 (4th) (Double A side with I Have a Dream), Christmas #1 1999.<br />2.Fool Again: UK#1 (5th).<br />6.Unbreakable: UK#1 (11th).<br />11.The Rose: UK#1 (14th).

0525423656|4.0|Originally posted (with more reviews) at Girls on YA Books (blog).<br /><br />~Review:<br /> Crossed was kind of the answer to my prayers...relating to the Matched Trilogy. As you remember(if you saw my review of Matched) I mentioned that Matched lacked some depth. Well Hallelujah!! This book had depth!! A whole new depth to depth ;) You finally got more information of the Society and how it came to be. And you got more depth from the characters.<br /><br /> Cassia is strong in this book. She has to be. I loved her! She is no longer an empty vesicle.Cassia is who she is and is comfortable with that and is willing to go to any extremes to find Ky. She is no longer the Societies little robot. No. She is rebellious!! I loved to read from her POV! Oh! And speaking of POV's!! Did anyone know that this book was alternating POV's?? Alternating POV's from both Cassia and uhem!!!....KY!!!!! :O<br /><br /> Ya. Awesome right!? I love Ky. He is the only one who has had depth from book 1 and he is the reason this book goes into deeper than deep in depth! Every thing about this boy is so good!! Loved Loved! Reading from Ky's perspective. Oh and be for warned... *spoiler* Even though Xander isn't in this book...you still have that love triangle goin on. EEp!! I loved getting more about Xander! I think that was my favorite part. You got to see him...HIM! And sides/stories you never saw coming! Idk bout my teams ya'll ;) Xander just got hotter than hott with a touch of secrets adding to a bad-boy rep muahah<br /><br /> The only thing that bugged me througout the book was the \\"Enemy\\". For starters....they all of a sudden showed up. In thin air! Out of absolutely no where in book 1. And it still failed to be explained in book 2. I understand they are a bit of a mystery but come on! From all the talk about everything else....as much as everyone seems to know about the Rebellion, the Pilot, the Society...no one knows why there even is an Enemy? When they started? Why they started? Seriously!!? Ya, it bugged. But not enough to ruin the book for me. And then the end...who in the flipping world is 'him\\" and it wasn't just in the end. Throughout the book there would be a mysterious \\"him/her\\" spoken about but you knew nothing about who it was! And no, it wasn't mysterious.<br /><br /> Altogether this book was just what I needed to save the Match trilogy for me. Crossed is poetically beautiful with its adventurous tale of finding yourself in a world where you are told who to be; to fight for the things you were never supposed to love; and to make the decisions that may or may not just save your life. I really loved Crossed and am looking forward to see how its all going to end in Reached. :D<br /><br />~Rating:<br /><br />**** ~4 stars!

1400079144|5.0|I just recently read and finished Dan Brown's other 2 books in this series, Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code. I enjoyed them both (though I have not yet seen the movies), so I figured I'd give this a try. The first time I went to read it, I lost interest within the first chapter, so I let it sit for a month or so. I'm very happy I picked it up again!! I enjoyed this one almost as much as The Da Vinci Code. It has a similar plot line to the others, it starts with a murder/kidnap and Robert Langdon is called in to figure it out. The Lost Symbol changed it up a little and I am very much looking forward to the movie! I defiantly recommend this book if you like mystery/thrillers.

This edition, however, is chock full of errors.<br /><br />I have scanned the other reviews and there is no mention of this.  Is this then only occuring on my Kindle, or is the Kindle communinty completely tolerant of these types of problems?<br /><br />Since there are no live human beings at Amazon, it will likely remain a mystery.  I don't even really know how to take a Kindle book back for a refund.<br /><br />From a literary standpoint, read the other reviews.  The are generally representative of my views.  You can live a full life without reading this book.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|needs moreover-- levels but a neat game just the same. Never did find the free acorn button.  Looking forward to more levels and harder challenges.
B006RUJST6|5.0|this book is perfect for a quick and ejoyable read. it was hard to put down, i read the entire book in 2 days.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I figured this for some sappy, lame Nicholas Sparks type thing. I got it for my friend who likes that kind of thing. I decided to put it on just for background noise while I was working. I found the story so compelling, I had to stop my work & concentrate on the film. I'm giving it 5 stars to counter balance all the 1s I don't think it deserves at all. People that are giving it one star because it's  not exactly like the \\"real\\" story are way off base. The film never claims to be a documentary & is obviously meant to be a Hollywood film \\"based on\\" a story. The people who wrote the book, the one's who it is based on, had veto power over the scripts...if people did their homework, they'd know this script/movie was done with their blessing so these others have no legit complaint.<br /><br />If you like human interest stories, do yourself a favor & check this one out.
B0036T31YY|5.0|This movie is great. It takes the old time line and twists it one more time. Its like Deception but with time. Pay attention so you don't miss the count.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very good game grand kids occupied for long periods of time. they love getting points to get new challenges
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is so fun . I love it. you can make a lot of swigls. and it would counghts. I'ts fun
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. once I figured out that I had to use the option. button to return to my homescreen on my kindle fire its been a lot of fun. my nieces and nefews love playing it with me.
B007URCTOG|1.0|Earlier this year, I was forced to watch this against my will on Valentine's Day.  This movie was cliched to the point of self-parody.  I disliked the contrived romance and the way too convenient happenings throughout (Aw, now Paige likes the rich guy we're supposed to hate!) the story.  The disapproving and rich father(Sam Neil) was so stock as an antagonist that he wouldn't have been out of place twirling the ends of his mustache in a black and white cartoon.<br /><br />To properly frame the disdain I have for this movie, I'll share a story.  After watching this movie, I never spoke to the woman that insisted we see this film on a date again.  Avoid at all costs.
B000001FKY|3.0|As a Def Leppard fan I was looking forward to getting a cd and cd cover. I got a cd with no cover. I can't read credits about the band, see pics, etc. Now I have to buy another copy. I could have gotten (just) the music anywhere.

B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|What can you say....roxette are masters at what they do. Some great tracks with a really cute version of \\"perfect excuse\\". Gessle has got it right yet again and Sweet sweet Marie is in great form considering everything she has been through. The live tracks show us Roxette's true roots....they are an out and out...Live band!
B000LN7HUC|5.0|Best reliable fully functional stove for the right price will last forever. I'm buying two incase some freak incident in the future leads to them going off shelves lol. AT approved.
1597801585|3.0|On the whole this book has lots of really good points: The setting, the premise, the character of the wind-up girl but I was dissappointed too. The title is misleading for a start - the wind-up girl is a minor part of the story which is a shame because its the most interesting and most underdeveloped.<br /><br />Iknow you shouldn't buy a book because of it's title but I did and maybe that was part of the problem. I just wanted to find out about her but it was like the author didn't really have anywhere to go with that story line.<br /><br />Some of the characters just didn't interest me at all. I found myself skimming which is never a good sign.<br /><br />However, if you are into Dystopian settings - this is a killer. Megadont's (modified elephants) generate the strength to create power and Springs have some kind of mould on them that creates energy. There's no natural power, no lifts, no cars etc. Most food has been genetically created and has killed millions. It's a scary sight into the future.<br /><br />Definately worth a look.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I enjoy this game a lot. At first,  it takes some time to build up enough energy to really accomplish anything but now I have enough to do many things. The most annoying thing about the game are the constant notifications I get. I turned all noticiations off but,  I still get 3 notifications every time I exit the game. I have not spent a dime on the game and I will not until I stop.receiving notifications.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|reminds me of old school Mario bros. keeps me entertained for hours. it is well worth downloading. wish there were more like this.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|What a dispointment this was.  So much of the movie was focused on Thatcher's supposed dementia in her old age rather than on her conflicts or achievements.  I can't for the life of me understand why Meryl Streep agreed to do this crap movie.  Perhaps she felt she couldn't pass up the chance to play m. thatcher.  Well she should've waited for the next m. thatcher screenply to come along.  As talented as she is even her perfection could not save this movie.
B0081L37Z0|2.0|Hey, I can understand how one might enjoy this film, but for me it was irritating.<br /><br />It got off on the wrong foot for me from the very first when the main character said 2 different things that I disliked a lot. First his line used Gosh Damn except he didn't say Gosh. This is a pet peeve curse of mine that I can't stand. Next he told some gang member type of character that he would beat his d*** off.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />The writers on this film continue to include pure gems like the above. Not my cup of tea.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|50 Shades is not a profound read and I didn't expect it to be.  It was everything that I wanted to be. It was an entertaining, easy read that did not require a lot of thought process.  Which was perfect considering I was finishing up my summer semester at school.  A perfect book for the beach or pool.  Other than the over use of the word \\"flush\\" and the phrase \\"oh my,\\" it was a fun and easy read (don't get me started about her \\"inner-goddess and her \\"subconscious\\").  Don't expect anything life-altering or inspiring.  This is not that kind of book.  At it's best, 50 Shades of Grey is entertaining and is good for some light reading material.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My only regret regarding this movie is that I only saw it once at the theater! Ah, now the wait for it to arrive in disc form...
034580404X|5.0|... with this series!!!  I was sad when it ended, like I had lost a dear friend or lover.  Sadly, I had to let this trilogy go on to the next set of persons to read it, but I eagerly await its return.
B0083VDK96|5.0|Gardot has such a unique voice and style. She reminds me of Peggy Lee and Billie Holliday in that way.
0425263908|4.0|This book was very similar to \\"50 Shades of Grey\\", including the main character's name (Eva) and the whole CEO thing.  That being said, as a little disturbing as their histories are, I thought this book was pleasent to read and I enjoyed it.  Can't wait to get the second one!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This book transported me, enchanted me and kept me reading as harold kept walking. It is an an immensely moving, beautifully imagined book about journeys, both outward and inward toward the self. I loved this book. I didnt want to stop reading.
B000AYEL1A|2.0|luv babs bigtime, think she is babsolutely beautiful, talented, sexy, etc., BUT this vehicle does nada to uphold these virtues, have no clue who is responsible for the song selection, lighting, HAIR!!!, wardrobe, but all duds, just hearing that damn phone ring at least FIVE TIMES before he picks up while banging his banjo is just one example, this theme was rampant throughtout from hearing a convo at the bar while she was first seen performing on stage with the two talented singers, and she claims he is killing her act because he can't decide between a beer or tea....soooooo annoying and this film signature is sposed to create a disjointed mood??? cmon people the plot, chemistry and miscasting is ENUFF to deal with let alone so many audio destractions... the finale was the perfect showcase to have fans ultimately decide who is numero uno vs ms. judy and if it wasn't so long and inappropiate with the rock transition I might have given her the edge, but just more annoying, non-memorable tune, lyrics, staging... what rocker in his right mind would even look at ester hoffman, great stage name btw, and I think KK looked absolutely gorgeous, had no idea he had such a rock hard bod, ptl for one positive! think this is the worst of her films, was hoping for so much more, would def like to her her comments tho, recommend solely for that insight....sigh
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|riordan needs to stop doing so many cliffhangers i mean hes like i need to save my freinds the it ends !!!!
1934356476|1.0|TLDR: If you prefer reading \\"...for Dummies\\" style books then this is probably the book for you. Otherwise stay away.<br /><br />From a purely information content perspective, this is actually a rather good book on the subject, but it's so painful to read that it's nearly useless. If I had read more of the reviews I might have been prepared for the \\"Insipid Tales of Bill the Asinine Coworker\\", as others have put it so well. But I didn't, and now I'm paying the price. It's a shame that eBooks can't be returned.<br /><br />Unfortunately the book's description leads one to think that this is a more serious book about an advanced programming topic rather than a story about starting a new job and learning the difference between \\"Good Metaprogramming\\" and \\"Evil Metaprogramming\\". I'm sure some people like that style, and Harry Potter fans will be delighted by the \\"spell book\\" at the end. For me, it makes reading more difficult because I spend most of my time scanning over the noise looking for the real content, only to find it and then realize that it's referencing some nugget that was buried somewhere in the narrative. Very frustrating.

1468161660|4.0|I really liked this book. I came in with no expecations and was throughly happy with my purchase. The book had many twists I would not have expected and that made it that much better. I laughed, I cried, I smiled quite a bit. I have never heard of SLAM poetry before this book and thought that was a nice addition to it. It made the book that much more unique.
1423101502|5.0|My 8 yr old boy said \\"this is the best book in the series!\\".  He can hardly put the book down.  I love it when he found books that can make him love to read.  This definately one of them.
1466401885|5.0|I have recently become addicted to reading kindle romance books. This one I decided to try out since it was pretty affordable and had so many good reviews. I was not disappointed at all. Their story sucked me in and I could not stop reading. Yes my husband and kids probably suffered but it was a great book. It had the token bad boy who underneath it all was just looking for the right girl. I would definitely recommend.
1401225756|5.0|Hey dumby what are you doing?  I am a 21 year old college student with no writing background.  Why are you reading what i am wrote instead of this award winning graphic novel by Neil Gaiman?  That is right Neil Gaiman, the English novelist, graphic novelist and screenwriter (source wikipedia).  If you have ever woke up in the morning opened your eyes and taken a breath you will love this graphic novel.  The only possible reasons to not fall deeply in love with this story are that you are insanely jealous of someone being this talented; or that your husband left you after reading this and found out that the feelings he felt to you all those years did not come close to the feeling he got whilst reading sandman.  They only bad part about this entire sereis is that it ends. But do not worry, because Neil Gaiman just announced a few days ago that he will be writing another arc of sandman that will be released in 2013.  So get to it, order the first trade of sandman, read it, than regret only getting the first trade and not every trade.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|I saw the season 5 breaking bad series premiere yesterday and it was incredible! It reminded me of how amazing season 4 was and to REFRESH my memory I watched the whole thing over again. Not ONE other show on television (perhaps the sopranos) can compare to the magnitude and ENGAGEMENT of this show. Season 4 is so very epic and it had me literally terrified for the characters on screen. HOW THINGS GO OUT OF CONTROL! The problem with this last season is that I lost about a day and a half of my life watching it. Once you start you just CANNOT stop.<br /><br />The most amazing part of this entire season and the scene which particularly blew my mind was the way Gus got RID of the mexican cartel by poisoning them. It was a very bold move and truly gus is a man with balls of STEEL. His intuition for example when he realized that Walt was watching him go to his car across the street. He senses things in the air. Also when Jesse spirals down into depression after killing that chemist guy and just has tons of crazy parties and THROWS money at his local crackheads and make them fight for it. The DEPRAVITY of those scenes is so gripping and TERRIFYING. The more so TERRIFYING that you know it is based on what happens in reality.<br /><br />CANNOT wait for the rest of season 5!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this app is very similar to some other civilization building apps with a couple differences that make it unique enough to stand out and the little details are what make this app so addicting and at the price of free I believe it is a must have.

B005DC68NI|5.0|As the author of two self-pubbed novels, I avidly read a lot of books on the topic. Gaughran's book is by far the best of the lot. It is balanced, well-written, and to the point. If you have time to read only one book on self-publishing, make it this one.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought the DVD thinking for such a great price why not try it. I have been wanting to lose some weight ever since I had my daughter. It's great that the workouts only take 20 mins because that means I have no excuse to not do it . Everyone has 20 min. I went into it thinking I was just going to get into shape and I was pleasantly surprised to see my body changing. So far I have lost 9lbs and I am on day 13!!! I highly recommend this to anyone! Very pleased that I bought it! Just remember to push yourself and stick with it! :)
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I only read half of this book.  It was like pulling teeth.  I felt district 13 to be a cold place where people didn't feel--even Katniss most of the time.  The other two books were just so much better than this one.
0756404738|4.0|This was a great follow-up to the first book, and I can't wait for the next one. The author does a good job of walking the fine line between keeping you on edge, and going too far and aggravating the reader while we wait for something to happen. I am a little curious how this trilogy will actually be a trilogy. It seems like there is just so much more that needs to take place, and yet only one more book in which for it to happen.<br /><br />On another note, has anyone else noticed a number of minor similarities with this series and The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan? To be honest, I can't come up with many examples anymore because I read the book awhile ago, but I remember as I read it I was often struck with similarities. One I can remember is the name \\"Rand\\" is in both books. I believe there is also an Illan or some town named that in Rothfuss' book, and an Illian in The Wheel of Time. Anyways, I know there were a number of other examples but I just can't remember them off the top of my head, but was curious if anyone else thought the same.
B000B5XOXY|1.0|this movie stinks i strongly dislike joels batman movies i prefer the tim burton batman movies and the chris nolans batman trilogy this movie stinks jim carrey is overacting same with tommy lee jones the only good person in this movie were val kilmer and nicole kidman but even those two could not save this terrible movie and robin does not even look like robin in this frikin movie the actor they choose to play robin was not even the right age to play robin thanks joel schumacher for almost destroying the batman movie frenchise with batman forever and batman & robin

B00466HN72|5.0|My kids ADORE this movie.  We got it from the Easter Bunny and they were 22 months old at the time.  They ask for it by name and actually watch most of it.  I think they enjoy the cross between real and cartoon characters.  There are lots of bright colors plus bunnies and chicks!  I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for something for Easter, or just something entertaining for the kids.
0393061310|5.0|Ok I got a lot out of this book.<br /><br />Like Yali, the charismatic New Guinean local politician who quizzed the author 25 years before the book was written wanting to know why Europeans developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea which had little cargo of theirs, I bought this book in a bid to understand why Africa and its inhabitants developed at a much slower pace than other continents. Was it a matter of fate? Or was the politically incorrect charge that Africans are innately inferior to their fairer skinned counterparts somewhat justified ?<br /><br />Jared Diamond makes a strong case for Geography's deterministic role in the evolution of societies. In other words, the rich societies of today simply won the geographical draft lottery (in terms of who got the largest continental pie/size, who got the most ideal conditions for farming, who got the most number of wild mammals suitable for domestication, and who got the widest variety of wild plant species ideal for agriculture) played over 13,000 years ago when modern man began to settle into village life in a few parts of the world. That decisive edge, reinforced over the last 13,000 years is what led to the emergence of an indomitable Europe that eventually came to lead the world due to its development of guns, germs, and steel.<br /><br /> According to the Author, Eurasia got decisively lucky in more ways than one:<br /><br />The Late Pleistocene extinction decimated Eurasia's competitors by felling wild mammal species of most of North and South America and those of Africa that may have facilitated intensive farming instead of the hunter-gathering lifestyle which eventually became a big impediment to the development of rapidly evolving complex societies on those continents. Those extinctions left Eurasia with many more wild candidates for domestication than the Americas and Africas offered.<br /><br />Agriculture and Continental Size were huge enablers. Eurasia is twice as large as the next largest continent, Africa,  and had a wide extensive landmass of fertile soil amidst a variety of wild life that were easily domesticated for animal herding and valuable crops that facilitated the development of intensive farming techniques that helped serve denser populations and formed the basis for the formation of complex organized societies. Denser populations tend to rise only under conditions of food production, populations served by food surpluses from intensive farming techniques were more likely to have non-farming specialists, technocrats, warriors and bureaucrats. In contrast, poorer societies such as hunter-gatherers without such advantages remained as hunter-gatherers living in bands which were far from ideal to produce crop surpluses available for redistribution or storage, and hence could not support and feed non-hunting craft specialists, armies, bureaucrats, and chiefs to enable them evolve complex societies.<br /><br />In turn, agriculture spawned lethal germs emanating from Eurasian's long advantageous exposure to domestic Animals which was as decisive in eliminating local populations in conquest as guns and steamboats were.  As illustrated by the New world's conquest of almost 95 percent of the 20million American Indians; exposing the Indians to strains of germs the Indians had never been exposed to, and against which they therefore had neither immunity nor genetic resistance to.<br /><br />The development of writing was another essential agent in assisting the conquests of Eurasian Societies: by fostering the development of maps that were beneficial to sailors exploring new lands to conquer, by providing a new way of communicating and (through preserved records) inspiring later generations to conquest, writing played a crucial role in the course of civilization but could not have been possible without food production. Writing emerged independently only in the Fertile Crescent, Mexico, and China because those were precisely the first areas were food production arose in their respective hemispheres.<br /><br />I already told you that what brought me to this book was to understand why as an African, we've evolved rather slowly compared to everyone else? I got my money's worth somewhere in pg 399 where the author states that \\"the factor behind Africa's slower rate of Post Pleistocene development compared with Eurasia's is the different orientation of the main axes of thee continents. Like that of the Americas, Africa's major axis is north-south, whereas Eurasia's is east-west. As one moves along a north south axis, one traverses zones differing greatly in climate, habitat, rainfall, day length, and diseases of crops and livestock. Hence, crops and animals domesticated in one part of Africa had great difficulty in moving to other parts. In contrast crops and animals moved easily between Eurasian societies thousands of mile apart but at the same latitude and sharing similar climate and day lengths\\". In a nutshell, geography, and not biology, ultimately did us in.<br /><br />I found this book a bit of a slog to get through due to the author's interdisciplinary approach ( history, archaeology, evolutionary biology, sociology, cultural anthropology etc) which mirrors his career trajectory so far. One of the few bones I have to pick with the book, as so many other reviewers have already mentioned, is its lack of sources. I also thought the author strove, quite frequently, a bit too hard for political correctness in for example, sounding a bit patronizing to the plight of poor societies like mine. I admit it may amount to career suicide for a tenured professor to have done otherwise; but to my mind any reader who can't handle a little intellectual honesty no matter how inconvenient isn't ready to address the fundamental questions about the human condition. For some reason, the kindle version I purchased didn't have images due to copyright issues. A bit of a setback because I didn't have any maps handy to make sense of the strange locations that pop up at various points in this read  and no thanks, I like to read with an internet connection as far from me as possible. Then lastly, there was the glossy treatment of why different parts within Eurasia developed differently which he addresses scantly in a later edition of the book.<br /><br />But GGS ultimately proved to be a great read for me, and highly recommended for anyone who wants a keener appreciation of the world we live in today. But be forewarned, you may never see the world the same way again which surely is a good thing.duction arose in their respective hemispheres.<br /><br />I already told you that what brought me to this book was to understand why as an African, we've evolved rather slowly compared to everyone else?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Oh my god!!!! I knew I would love this book when I read the first sentence of the summary. this book has it all in my view and I think Collins language was good though not as good as harper lees but much better than stephanie meyers. The book is a love triangle but the world in which it takes place is fascinating. I like this book because I feel like I could live there because I know the history , politics and the way society works which really makes a book. I started reading the hunger games in 2010 during the christmas break and I turned page after page I was wondering how on earth is it that this book isnt in the charts . It was a matter of days beore it became number one and after the movie even the most reluctant readers have tried this book and that Ms.Collins has encouraged many children to read and should be proud.=)
0393088774|5.0|Professor Krugman incisively chops away at the intellectual delusions and popular myths that have stood and still stand in the way of economic progress in America and Europe. His reasoning is clear and pragmatic throughout and one gets a sense of how far things have teetered politically right (or just more ignorant) from a healthy centrism. It's also clear just what he's up against: a daunting array of obscurantists.<br />It occurred to me he is kind of like a Superman of economic theory, and he's chosen his battles well and sticks to what he knows best. This is not political punditry but very much scientific in approach. I did wish he would have concluded with estimates of what levels of stimulus might be required in the coming years, but I understand I think why he didn't. He probably couldn't speculate without more information as that information arises in the future.  Still, I bet he's thinking in terms of at least a few trillion.<br />I was glad to see the truth shine through and applaud his myth-debunking. This book may very well provide a basis for the next several decades of saner fiscal policy here and abroad. I hope so, but he did, to my surprise, pretty much bypass the climate crisis. He also didn't mention the student debt crisis. According to climate scientists and leading environmental science scholars, the situation is so dire that it is truly apocalyptic in nature. It may require even more drastic kinds of fiscal expenditures and social policies than have really been considered by the mainstream press.<br />A full transition to a soft energy path (solar, wind, geothermal) is required worldwide. What if some countries suddenly take much more drastic moves than the US might? How would that affect the US economy? I wonder if, in doing such a great job of clarifying how we need to get back on a track we were previously on, and achieving a balanced view, didn't quite go far enough in making more radical demands. Ultimately, folks need to feel they are working towards a common good for a healthy sense of patriotism to occur, and maybe solidarity for the sake of a new fiscal policy or recovery package could really encourage activism that could make those goals a reality, but I think people need also to envisage a kind of holistic world in which many many things are improved. They need an image, faces. Krugman has attacked the heart of the matter, and this may well go a long way towards alleviating suffering and waking people up. He's attacked an intellectual or rhetorical disease with intellectual rigor. Bravo! Maybe this will inch us those precious first steps toward a Scandinavian model? Ultimately though, it is an eminently patriotic book which could very well be a panacea which represents the cumulative evolution of 200 years of economic philosophy, finally free of ideological setbacks and atrocious wars. This is subtly but powerfully an antiwar book.king towards a common good for a healthy sense of patriotism to occur, and maybe solidarity for the sake of a new fiscal policy or recovery package could really encourage activism that could make those goals a reality, but I think people need also to envisage a kind of holistic world in which many many things are improved.

B0000257MA|5.0|'Scream Bloody Gore' was my introduction to death metal back when it came out. It was \\"over the top\\" for this thrash fan...and I didn't really warm up to it. It wasn't until 'Leprosy' came out that I began to appreciate this new style. 'Leprosy' is a solid slab of genre-defining metal. It is definitely more simplistic from a technical aspect, but the riffs and songwriting are legendary in my opinion. This release will always be the definition of \\"death metal\\" to me. I don't know if the kids nowadays appreciate this simpler take on things or require the superfast technical style, but I know that I love it. 'Pull the Plug' is my favorite track.
0865478570|2.0|A bunch of non-technical essays about translation written in a pop-science kind of manner. I think you will like this book if you like languages. I don't think a professional translator would find anything of interest in the book. Personally, I found some of the essays tedious and others very interesting. Generally, I would have liked a bit more technical information. I think the content is worth two stars meaning that it is not really worth purchasing the book. There are so many more interesting things to read. Start there :)
B006RUJST6|3.0|This is the type of book great for Teens and virgins looking forward to their first times that are still in early 20's. Very romantic and full of tragedy. But don't wait for something really sexy to happen. The characters are very colourful and memorable. Not happy about the second book written in Will's perspective. Kind of expected more from a male's mind but he thinks like a woman.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|I tried to order this epic movie and my most fave film here at Amazon but sadly shipping policies are relegated to the domestic market., but my luck changed here in my country and saw one store ( not going to mention name ) having a couple of stash hidden along with the single and 2-disc final cut special edition Blu Ray for only 20 dollars. WOW!!! I actually was tempted to buy the entire discs they had in store.. but no.<br /><br />  I never tire seeing this film, it is so overwhelmingly beautiful. It's very relevant story ( even to this day ), the atmospheric lighting, Vangelis' haunting music, I so loved the gorgeous Sean Young in this film, Ruthger Hauer tears from the rain line, and Harrison Ford's epic and very \\"human\\" portrayal.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD 3 weeks ago and I am now advanced to level. It was tough at first but now I am used to the work-out. I must admit Jillian is a tough trainer but I must say its for good reasons. I have lost 8lbs so far and several inches. I am also eating healthy.<br /><br />I love the convenience of working out at my own convenience and not worry about driving to a gym.  I usually work out in the morning 5 days a week(off Tuesday and Saturday).<br /><br />If you are serious about loosing weight and getting shredded you need to get this DVD.

0345803485|5.0|It's a fun read and a nice escape.  Brings back memories of \\"many firsts...\\"<br />You will fly through the books, so instead of ordering just the first one with plans to getting the others as you finish, I suggest purchasing the trilogy (check with the delivery time for the box set first.  It has had a lag time, and might be faster to just order the books individually all in the same order.  You don't save much money with the trilogy anyway).
B006PKQQJS|5.0|this game is incredible. it doesn't have any glitches or problems at all. I finished perfect on all levels and achieved all the awards. totally worth your money.

B001UV4XIS|2.0|Let me preface this review by stating that this is a PRODUCT review, not a movie review.  I love all the Harry Potter movies and decided to download the digital copy of this one.  It took me roughly a million years to download the movie with Flixster and the quality is about the worst possible.  Streaming isn't possible for me due to my slow rural internet connection, but I thought it would be nice to take the time to download the movie to my laptop so I can take it with me when I travel... er, no.  It's going to be deleted... I would rather not watch it at all due to the horrendous visual quality.  Furthermore, even if I was at a location where I could use UltraViolet, I can't access my account right now due to inherent flaws in UltraViolet's tech support.  I'm not sure what the studios were thinking here, but UltraViolet and Flixster are failures in my opinion.  Fortunately for WB, the Harry Potter movies are spectacular and fans will buy them despite all the problems with UltraViolet and Flixster.  Unfortunately for movie fans, people have no choice but to buy movies with these digital \\"services\\" and WB and other studios will see this as a green light to give us more of the same.  If you are going to buy these movies, do it with the assumption that you are not getting a usable digital copy, because really you won't be getting a usable digital copy.
B00634GHJA|5.0|This app easily allows transfer of photos and videos between phones and desktops. It even does it seamlessly between iOS and Android.  That is usually a pain to do. Free on Android but a couple of dollars for iOS.  Don't understand that. Anyway,  good stuff.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|When I first opened the box i noticed the outer boxing was different, it had 3 images of Harry at different ages, no biggie. When I removed the cellophane to look at each individual DVD I realized the items were UK zone and did not contain any of the bonus features shown in the second photo. I am returning this item immediately. The item is listed as being sold by Simon Tang, I'm not sure if he works for the company Amazon claims the item comes from, but he did not send the correct item at all.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is addicting. I also love the new updates, and I no longer have any problems since I downloaded the newest updates. I heartily recommend this to all young players who love the easy movement of a &quot;story&quot; kind of game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun game to play on the kindle. hope I am able to not lose interest like I do with most of these app games
B007SYWFRM|5.0|in your village. Including a movie with scrat and a fun game with scrat that you can actually play. I<br />like this app because although it gives you the option to buy coins and acorns you dont have to<br />spend money to recieve them. The more families you have the more coins you get. The more you play<br />and complete missions yoh play the more acorns you receive which allow you to buy more animals
B005WMQ5R8|3.0|After all the great reviews from other Amazon reviewers, I ordered this movie in blu ray, with great expectations.<br /><br />The animation itself is top notch.  If you are an anime expert who enjoys digesting the ability animators may showcase in their works, then this is the movie for you.  I am no expert, but I have seen enough anime to be able to tell you that this is one of the finest animations to be produced so far, in the technical sense.<br /><br />Now....the storyline/plot/character designs were, in my opinion, not up to par with the animation skills shown.  The character designs were very weird looking and kind of disgusting.  The storyline tended to the action-comedy type, which I do not favor per se.  (I was expecting something more akin to action-sci fi-dark humor, instead).<br /><br />I may view this movie probably another additional instance before selling the blu ray, as it did not make want to keep it on my collection.  Ghost in the Shell, for example, is my favorite anime, and a keeper in my collection.
B005LAIGZU|1.0|Apparently you can't review anything here without being disrespected or getting hate-mail, which makes this even more ironic. I understand some people can be very patriotic, but if you can't show any respect for what people think about a \\"movie\\", well...<br /><br />I have a lot of respect and admiration for the SEALS and every other member or our Military/Armed Forces. However, this movie goes overboard in many things (plot, \\"acting\\", etc) to the point where I think it should be advertised as something other than a movie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a great game.  very easy to get sucked in.  just enough strategy to keep pulling you back in. will be interesting to see if the game continues to be so.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|OK, I returned this for a refund because I just couldn't read the whole thing.<br /><br />I was completely disgusted by the sex scenes I did get to in the book. It was literally sickening. I'm not so into a book about some young rich guy who has had multiple different sex slaves and then has a girl sign a contract promising not to speak about their sex life together. I'm also not into a book where I have to sit through a girl who has multiple sex partners just for the fun of it in college and develops feelings for all of them. That's quite offensive to any decent woman and a bad influence.<br /><br />Now, about the grammar. It wasn't as bad as some said but but why do I have to keep reading about \\"my/his breath hitched?\\" What does that even mean? It was also completely unrealistic. I agree with another reviewer that this was like some teenage girl's fantasy. I mean, come on. It was so unrealistic it wasn't even enjoyable. I'm not old either. I'm only in my early 20s and I didn't like it.<br /><br />When it's all said and done, I wasted my time on this one. Now, to find a book about a good old-fashioned romance instead of some modern day feminist fantasy of sex just for the fun of it without commitment.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Wow.  This story sucked me in quick.  I really enjoyed the read.  Part two took an unexpected turn for me, which I rather liked as well. The end... not so much.  Have you ever watched a movie, and it's clear they had a good idea to begin with, but then they just didn't now how to end it?  That's how this was for me.  It was a softball ending that left me disappointed.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|The movie is one of my favs! The books are awesome too... where is the sequel? I can't wait for book three, movie people need to get to work on movie#2 The Power of Six
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I read this because of all the hoopla about the upcoming film starring the ill-cast Tom Cruise.  This book, on it's own, was just okay for me.  It wasn't bad; I read it all the way through.  It was somewhat predictable, but not terribly.  It had lots of elements that were just too... coincidental... that were necessary to move the story along.  I'm not opposed to read another Reacher novel, but I'm in no hurry to do so.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'll echo the sentiment of some other reviewers: the \\"meat\\" of this story was SO GOOD, but then the ending made me actually hate the book.  It was such a disappointment after all the build up and twists and turns the story had taken and then....that.  I was so excited to see how the author brought all the loose ends together but don't get your hopes up; just enjoy the story if you can.  I'm one of those who loves the ending and seeing everything come together and unfortunately that's what this book lacked.  Based on my experience with this one, I wouldn't read another of the authors books.  Why would I invest the time in it only to be disappointed at the end?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been a fan of King for a long time, but I got to the point where I didn't really want to read any more of his stuff for a while.  It had been a few years, and the topic for 11/22/63 intrigued me.  Before this book, I had never experienced the proverbial \\"page turner.\\"  You know, the book you literally cannot put down.. you just have to keep reading it.  That's what this became for me.  The mix of real life historical events, along with King's slant on fiction was incredibly well done.  I have recommended this book verbally to all my bookworm friends and acquaintances.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Supernatural is not your run-of-the-mill TV show. It has unique storylines, awesome special effects, snappy dialogue and great characters, like Death and Balthazar.<br /><br />Season Six is one of the best seasons. SPOILER ALERT: We get to see Sam shirtless and Dean turn into a vampire. It has the episode called \\"The French Mistake\\" where Dean and Sam are transported to a universe where they are merely actors on a TV show called \\"Supernatural\\". That episode is an absolute riot.
B007IX00ZC|5.0|I'm not smart so just believe me when I say this album is a great listen, even without that drummer... Mr. Drummer or whatever his name is.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I agree with the others that say this book had a rushed feel to the ending. It was also very predictable. I thought this might happen though, as the second book was not as good as the first.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is really fun cause after I finished temple run I try to get all of these games, so I love it
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I really don't understand all the negative reviews of this film.  Seriously, do so many people just not \\"get it?\\" If you are a fan of anime, World of Warcraft, Dungeons and Dragons, The Lord of the Rings, or Kill Bill I and II then you will LOVE this movie! It incorporates elements of them all. It was so well done too! I caught it by mistake halfway through and was sucked in right away! I was thrilled to see it on Blu Ray along with an extended version of the film. With all the crap coming out of Hollywood these days as well as endless remakes of the same films, it's refreshing to see something new for a change! People shouldn't knock it.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Growing up it was me, mom, my two sisters and, often enough, a few of my sisters' friends. My cousins mostly girls and my aunts around often. At most of the jobs I've had my female co-workers have always liked me more than the bros do. And, by far, my music and book collections tend to be far more female-centric than those of my friends'. Needless to say, I like women. I think, as a gender, women tend to be stronger, saner, more honest and less destructive than men. That said, I've never found it easy to write about female artists. I tend to love Fiona Apple's work but, outside of simply saying \\"I like this song a lot\\" or \\"her vocals are as good as any around,\\" I'm usually left mum. So yes, I think very highly of Ms. Apple. I consider her to be one of my favorite female singer / songwriters ever and easily one of the most consistent ballad writers and album-makers of her generation. But still, I'm not sure how to talk about her songs. They're just so ... so ... feminine. In powerful, vulnerable, jazzy, poppy, angry, naked, beautiful ways. And I like that, because I learn from it.<br /><br />When Apple's last studio record, Extraordinary Machine, was released, I was 25 years old and Fiona was nearly 28. It was her third record in nine years and it was, rightfully so, one of the most celebrated discs released in 2005. Things have changed a lot since then. For me, for the world and, of course, for music fans and the record industry. But, for Fiona, the only thing that's seemingly different is that she seems to be quite a bit skinnier. And maybe more focused in her art. Machine still stands loud as a modern classic - an album so good that few modern artists could dream of topping it. But that's just what Apple has done with her new record, The Idler Wheel Is Wiser than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More than Ropes Will Ever Do. The songs here are lean, mean, raw and focused, Apple's sense of adventure functioning at new levels of courage andbombast. A disc peppered with little details that are beautiful and endearing at every turn. A voice as memorable and purposeful as any on the planet. A set of 10 songs driven, at its core, by a combination of piano, vocals and words that never feel anything short of vibrant and vigorous.<br /><br />What's odd about this record, when compared to her other three releases, is that I get the impression that Fiona approached these songs - and the recording of these songs - in a more laid-back manner than ever before. A sign of maturity or just further steps towards absolute mastery of her art? Tough to say, but when \\"Valentine\\" plays I feel as if I'm hearing the kind of classic that will be played and covered and coveted for generations. And there are seven or eight of those tracks here. Or maybe ten of 'em. The words womanly, powerful and true, the vocals soaring and the arrangements masterful and surprisingly strange, I have no fear in calling Idler Wheel one of the year's most impressive collections so far. And certainly the kind of disc that I believe in, even if I'm still digesting it's endless turns and poetic confessions and pleas. The Idler Wheel is a record that will have a legacy; and one that will most certainly influence a generation of female writers, singers and thinkers. And maybe some of those bros, too.<br /><br />Read more of my music- and film-focused writing at ZeCatalist.com.

1897299214|1.0|This book has very little worth unless you have absolutely no knowledge about North Korea. Aside from a sparse few (maybe 3) frames in the book, the story does not go beyond simple western conception of the nation. In addition, the few references to women clearly show the author's sexist mindset. Lastly, the artwork is lackluster and unimpressive, to put it nicely. Not worth wasting your time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this a few months ago when the number of reviews was still <1,000. Not much more to add than what's already been said.<br /><br />5 stars for me is rare. But this one earned it. Stop reading this and go read Wool (and the prequel!)
B0058YPL66|5.0|I really enjoyed the first season of Once Upon a Time. I watched every Sunday and it kept me interested. They had really neat spins on all of the fairy tales. I think some of the graphics are weird, but the storyline is addictive. Can't wait for season 2!

B005WUHAX8|1.0|USE AT YOUR OWN RISK...<br /><br />I have heard many excellent reviews about this product.  Unfortunately, I had a horrible experience.  I received my case on Friday and went online to see about installation.  It's all very simple but you must follow everything to a T to insure you don't have a damaged case.<br /><br />I watched ALL the videos and tutorials... as well as taking a test to extend the warrantee for a full year.  You must do a water test for an hour, which I did as well.  When putting on the case you must make sure there is nothing that can interfere with the o-ring... which I did!<br /><br />I had the phone by the pool for less than an hour and the damn thing got water in it.  My phone had water damage and I had to purchase a new one the next day.  I go online to see about the warrantee and find out that they do not replace the phone under any circumstances.  It DOES say this on the packaging but I didn't see it until after the fact... I called and they still wouldn't cover my phone.  I didn't think to check the warrantee information because I just figured a company would stand by their product.  Had I known they wouldn't stand by it, I wouldn't have taken the chance.<br /><br />Again, i have heard many great things but at the same time.. When using this product you are TAKING A RISK and for a 700-800$ phone... I wouldn't do it again!<br /><br />The reason for my product review is just to warn people that it definitely isn't fully waterproof.  Apple said they have seen many people who have come in with water damaged phones from the Lifeproof case.... So it wasn't only me.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I've had this DVD for going on three weeks.  I've done Level 1 and Level 2.  I like it a lot, but for one thing.  In both segments, she cusses.  I mean, really?  I have to listen to this everytime I work out.  For me, it's enough to be irritating since I don't swear.<br /><br />It is an intense quick workout and it really makes my fat cry (sweat).  I noticed the difference in my stamina after the first week.  I was able to do a lot more of the exercises and work my way up to some of the nonmodified exercises.<br /><br />For beginners, there are modifications.  The stronger you get, you can intensify the workouts.  In reality, there are six workouts in the three levels, since you can do either the Beginner or the Advanced versions.<br /><br />I would recommend this workout, but Miss Jillian needs to chomp on a bar of soap before she does her next video.  :-)

I've tried reloading it several times but it just won't work.<br /><br />...... a year later......:<br /><br />This is an a pretty good game on Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Graphics are amazingly good.  Some of the puzzles are difficult to nearly impossible to solve without a cheat sheet, and even with it, sometimes don't make a lot of sense.  The 'process tree' to complete the game is a bit 'tedious'.  But all in all, it is a good way to lose a whole night's sleep or two.
0307730697|5.0|[[ASIN:0307730697 Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown]]<br /><br />Though the subject of Navy SEALs is not usually in my reading forte, I instantly fell in love with it and had a hard time putting it down.  The ups and downs of Adam's life and the dark times he met with faith and courage led him not to be afraid of death.  He was a true hero.
0345803485|5.0|I have good and bad to share.  With the kind of problems we have to face everyday in this day and age I was sure glad I could pick these books up at the end of the day and just get lost in them. I was sure glad I was given the opportunity to dream and fantasize.  I was sure glad Christian Grey was in my dreams for the past week.  I'm very sad to have read through them so quickly and now I have nothing to look foward to.<br /><br />The \\"bad\\"....the plot - we've seen it, the way it was written - nothing special, was it repetitive - A LOT, the erotic scenes - got boring by the 3rd book....in summary.....it will obviously not go down in histroy as one of the literary novels of this decade but it sure will be remembered by many!<br /><br />All the bad reviews for these books are true but then again, so are all the good ones! Get these books and enjoy them for what they are.....quoting Christian \\"don't overthink this\\".<br /><br />Enjoy
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Its a really good game. I like it a lot. I just wish that there would be a larger amount of energy.
034580404X|5.0|I absolutey enjoyed everything about the this triology. What can I say, some learning lessons that were ......mmm There was content to the story that went somewhere is what kept me reading, growth and learning of two people, a love story,<br />I will continue to read contribrution by E.L.James.

B006PGL7OQ|4.0|I saw that this movie had good reviews, and figured I should see it. I'm happy I saw it. The movie is full of suspense at certain moments, causing you to wonder about all the possibilities where the plot could wind up. Shannon and Chastain do a great job of complementing one another as husband and wife. The setting is very realistic which I also liked. The story builds throughout, so you have to be patient to let the story develop. Overall, I give a solid recommendation to see this film. Just be prepared to be nervous and scared at times.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I don't really get what people like about this. you get bored really fast but now I'm giving it a secound chance and would try it. but not as great as you think it would be.
0345803485|3.0|I have to say, I was curious... I told myself if it got too crazy..i'd just stop reading.  Well, I enjoyed the series a lot.  Had me scratching my head, laughing, gasping in shock, getting mad at Anastasia for putting up with Christian's weird shenanigans...and then reading more and more.  The graphic scenes are riveting and a bit shocking if you haven't read this type of stuff before, but by the end you are like..yawn, they are in the playroom again? ugh... All in all, it kept my attention, though I was disappointed when I got to the last book...  Let's see what happens when the movie comes out. :)
0553801473|5.0|I just finished the book today and I really don't understand why some people are so upset.  If they are complaining about the lack of plot resolution, might I suggest reading something else, perhaps a novel written by James Patterson?<br /><br />This is a fantasy *series* and as such there is a lot of world building, and A Dance With Dragons does not disappoint.  We are finally getting a taste of winter and a bit more description of what lies beyond the Narrow Sea.  It's great.  Sure, there are even descriptions of peoples of whom we didn't even know existed yet as of A Feast For Crows, but that's what makes this so interesting.  Some people might think George RR Martin could have finished the series using the characters that have already been introduced, but that seems absolutely unreasonable.<br /><br />This series is really good.  Really, really good.  A Dance With Dragons is no exception.<br /><br />Now, please, if you'll excuse me, the sun is receding and I must light a fire.  The night is dark and full of terrors.
B0047A72E6|5.0|Buddy Guy is one of my favorite blue guitarists and singers. I own many of his albums and this one, like so many of his others, delivers one of his best studio performances to date. He's now 75 years young and will be back in the studio again soon. Like a fine wine, he just keeps getting better with age.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|One of my favorite albums of the summer! Everyone should buy it! Many of the songs are even better than the originals. So get in the car, put down the windows, and blast it loud. Oh, and turn up the bass!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Really enjoyable yet very simple idea the best games often are. Finding myself preferring this game over my others, including the paid for ones.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book had so much heart. I laughed and cried, but in a good way. I couldn't put it down. It's evident the author wears her heart on her sleeve. I was pleased to see there was a sequel and finished it in just a few hours... The books aren't perfect, but they're close.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game and you can learn a little bit to!  You might want to watch young children though because, it has real money though you probably don't need it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was told about this game by a friend n now I just cant stop playing it. I am indeed addicted.
0756405890|5.0|I loved the first, and I love this one.  Not much more to it.  Go read it right now. Just do it.
B002Q7JYPC|3.0|There is some good music here - not great but good.  And there is a lot of mediocre and bad music here too.  This could have been really good if it had been weeded down to 1 disc.  I was waiting for a couple of Eagles classics but unfortunately there aren't any here.  Maybe next time????
0756407125|5.0|Seriously just buy this.  I have bought and given out probably 12 copies and have given them out.  My favorite book.
0735619670|5.0|I've read it, I'm reading it, I'll read it again.<br />There are few books I've found to be so helpful, broad in matter and yet comprehensive as this one is.<br />Anyone who considers oneself as a software developer (or aspires to become one) should read it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|gun free game. I loved serenade because I get s lot of points I hope to get the game that required 720000 right now I only have 200000

B0086700CM|5.0|fun game to pass the time. and its free! well that is jusrt even better. id recommend it to anyone
B008K8U13K|5.0|Amazon please fix your review system.  2 of the first 3 reviews are people who said in their review that they didnt buy the app.  One of those reviewers even says he wouldnt buy the app, but would take it if it were free.  All that I can say is wow.  People allowed to say whatever about any app, then beg for it and insinuate that the review would be better if it were given to him free so that he can give a fair review.  5 stars just because I'm allowed to, and I use to love playing Sonic.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|Ah, how the mighty have fallen. Mel Gibson, once the world's highest-paid actor (after receiving an at-the-time-record-breaking $30 million payday for his role in THE PATRIOT) and beloved by millions, got drunk one night, said some bad things, was drowned in REALLY negative press (some very deservedly so), and he went from superstar to pariah in just a few weeks. And here, he's co-written his own (essentially) Direct to Video star vehicle called GET THE GRINGO, a return to form into the kind of role that made him famous: The Violent Rascal. This is the type of role he helped to create the archetype for in the LETHAL WEAPON series and that he brought to many other films as well. But his character here is a little edgier, a little darker, a little more clever if not as violent and incendiary as Martin Riggs.<br /><br />The film opens with a car chase through the desert along the American/Mexican border. Two police cars are chasing a car driven by a character only known as \\"Driver\\" (Gibson). Seeing no way out on this side of the border, he crashes through the fence onto the Mexican side of the border, but it's straight out of the frying pan and into the fire as the corrupt Mexican federales see bags loaded with millions of dollars in the car and they dump Driver, obviously a career criminal, in a prison referred to El Pueblito, which is NOT like the prisons you see in The U.S. of A; in The Driver's words, \\"Is this a prison, or the crappiest mall on Earth?\\". There are non-prisoners amongst the population, such as wifes and children and some are allowed to come and go. There are also small but lucrative businesses in the prison; drugs, guns, prostitution, but also little food stands and bodegas that sell cigarettes, candy, soda pop and beer. The Driver is a man constantly on the move and on the make. He makes the observations of a thief and of someone intimately familiar with the prison system and hierarchy and sees the easiest way to get at the goods. It is during one of these observations that he sees Javi (Daniel Gimenez Cacho), the kingpin of El Pueblito and also during one of his thefts that he finds an ally in a tough 10-year-old boy, simply called \\"Kid\\" (Kevin Hernandez) who lives in the prison with his equally-tough mother (Dolores Heredia, also simply credited \\"Kid's Mom\\"), an inmate busted for drug trafficking some time before. Kid and Javi are on a collision course for reasons that I won't spoil here, but with Driver finding a friend in the kid and the mother, Driver has more personal reasons for staying.<br /><br />There are other fun sub-plots involving a corrupt U.S. Consulate official, the mobster Driver stole the money from, and various other shady individuals doing various shady things. The major cast is made up mostly of unknowns to American audiences and the performances by Kevin Hernandez and Cacho are pretty layered and exciting, but it is also populated with various other character actors, such as Dean Norris, Bob Gunton, Patrick Bauchau and Peter Stormare in very small roles. The director is Adrian Grunberg, a former assistant director making his feature directing debut. He's worked with Mel in the past on films like APOCALYPTO and EDGE OF DARKNESS, but his influence from others is more felt from his work on films like MAN ON FIRE, TRAFFIC and JARHEAD. Grunberg directs the film with some gusto and urgency, but make no mistake though: this is Mel's movie through and through. The character of Driver is very similar to his likable bad guy Porter in the original cut of 1998's PAYBACK (because the \\"Final Cut\\" released a few years back on DVD, his character is much darker). It's obvious that Mel's having a really good time making this film, and it's obvious that he co-wrote this (with director Grunberg and co-producer Stacy Perskie, a PA who worked with Grunberg on a few other films) to give himself a star vehicle that felt more like what we used to see him in, as opposed to the extremely dark EDGE OF DARKNESS or the heavier drama of THE BEAVER. All of the violent acts he commits have a cartoony action film feel to them and they're mostly committed with a glint in his eye, particularly a bravura sequence with two hand grenades and an umbrella.<br /><br />Despite what you may think about Mel Gibson personally, it hasn't diminished his capabilities as a consumate performer who does his best to engage the audience in his films. This film shows how much of a badass Mel can still be, but he's also gotten to a point where he's starting to wear his age well. I know (and I believe Mel knows as well) that he will never get back to where he was with star vehicles like GET THE GRINGO, but at least we can still get films where we get to see Mel kick some tail and have some fun with him along the way.<br /><br />3.5/5 Starshe heavier drama of THE BEAVER.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|I'm a big Alien fan.  I got a group of several of my best friends together just to go see this new addition in the theater.  I'm a fan of Damon Lindelof and Ridley Scott.  How was it that I walked out dumbfounded?<br /><br />A good sci-fi/thriller should enable  you to suspend disbelief - jump into a fantasy world and take it for a ride.<br /><br />But the characters in this movie had no believable motivations to do any of the stupid things they did.  It lost all believe-ability an left me disappointed.<br /><br />Like cheap haunted house stories - where every time someone goes in the barn you hear screams and they die.  And yet one after one, the people keep going in the barn?<br /><br />In this movie, one second we're running from alien monsters.  The next we're saying they're cute and sticking our faces down by them.  In one moment we're in an alien environment and paranoid about the unknowns.  The next, we're ditching the space helmets and breathing the air.  In one moment, we shoot at a space ship and watch part of it crumble - yet when it crashes into the planet's surface, it doesn't disintegrate - it rolls (on and on....)<br /><br />I guess I just expected more.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I bought this movie for my 22 month old daughter. She loves it! Disney is our go to for movies - since my husband and I have seen most of them through our childhoods we know we are okay with the content. There is a fight seen between the Tramp and some other dogs but it doesn't seem to bother her or scare her. Good family movie!
B005LAIGIM|5.0|There is a lot more to this movie than just comedy. Yeah, there are a few scenes that could have been cut a little shorter...the silent movie feel...but those scenes are there to exaggerate the feel of how difficult it can be to change ones ways. Jack must find a different way to express himself and approach life.<br /><br />He is a fast talker (a B.S.er who can sell any idea). He has not really changed or grown up in life and it shows in the way he relates to those closes to him.<br /><br />He lies to the spiritual teacher Dr. Sinja in order to be his book agent. A Bodhi tree suddenly appears in Jack's backyard once Dr. Sinja agrees to let him be his agent.<br /><br />The connection between Jack and the Bodhi tree? Think Tree of Life or his soul. Whatever happens to the tree happens to Jack. When Jack carelessly runs his mouth the tree loses its leaves.<br /><br />Jack is desperate. Jack sits under the Bodhi tree.<br /><br />There is a beautiful Dharma story here. Yes, its a movie with a message. And if you can get pass just a few tiny awkward scenes of silence...very few and small, it really is a beautiful film and worth watching and enjoying.<br /><br />You will laugh. You will be touched. And if you are lucky you may come away a bit more thoughtful.
B008K8U13K|1.0|it looks like hes holding a poke ball in screenshot 3. too much money and arparently stinks. I would get it if it was free
B0052VUNHC|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK! Could not put down..Great love story!! I recommend this book to everyone if they just want a quick love story. I even liked it better than 50 Shades (another great book) but that's my opinion. This book is a must!

0061537969|5.0|Purchased this book yesterday morning, to pass the time while traveling. The sample had me sold. I was only 2 pages in, and I was fully immersed in the character Enzo and the life of his people. Telling the story from the point of view of a dog, has been done. (Fluke, Marley and Me, ect) But, the way this book opens, grabs you from the beginning. It's no slow build up. You'll know from the sample if this is the book for you. I immediately felt the emotion of Enzo, the dog and I hadn't even heard his story yet. So I bought the book and read on. It's funny and sweet, if you are a dog owner, you may find yourself looking over at your dog, wondering if he's ever had similar thoughts as the main character. Does a dog's thought process go so deeply? Well, this book makes it believable. I enjoyed reading about Denny, Eve and Zoe through Enzo's eyes. The drama they go through, becomes a page turner. I couldn't stop reading. I stayed up late because I wanted to finish the story. I needed to know how it ended. I wasn't let down. Incredible book, start to finish. I felt the happiness of the family, the anger and sadness of Denny's struggle, and Enzo's frustration on being a dog who, so much of the time, could only watch and gesture as a companion. I am not a big fan of racing. I think it's boring. However racing is a big part of the story, it's used as a metaphor for life throughout much of the book. It's done in a way, that if you are not a Grand Prix fan, it is still tolerable. At points, I found myself reading, but getting annoyed by the race car metaphors. Although they did make sense. All in all, that's worth overlooking, it's a great read.
0345803485|5.0|This is a good book.  I received it in a timely manner and it was in perfeect condition.  Can't wait to read the other two in the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game. I recommend to all ice age fans. my son and I hate to put it down.
0596522347|3.0|I think that in review on this book it really depends on what you were looking for in the first place. If you're looking for something that's going to break down the \\"how-tos\\" and the mechanics of great slide presentations, you won't find that here.<br /><br />What you will find is a book that shows you what has worked for the author and leaves you with the creative ability to do work through the slide development process with some direction and a better understanding of what your end goal should look like. If you look at this book in an approach of \\"improving\\" what you already know and not looking for basic break downs on how to design slides, it becomes a very important piece of your educational process. There are a lot of things when it comes to the visual power of your communication. Presentations should be designed to be so much more than a compilation of bullet points and I feel like Nancy was able to express that.
B005SCSL56|5.0|i loved this book! it was hilarious and great! when i finished this book i was craving the sequal, but there isn't one! i was growling my head off at disapontment! though i loved it still..... recommend this for people who love fantasy and know the real versions of the fairy tales! example: cinderella

B006AZZPCM|2.0|would be a five star because I love this app. it downloads as MP3 great and fast. but when I listen to my songs it freezes my videos until I delete my songs. HTC thunderbolt.
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|The self-centered personality of the main character became progressively more difficult for this viewer to endure to the film's conclusion.  Her acting may have been very good, but if the result of her talents is principally to annoy the viewer, I think the film was a waste of time and effort.  The film was not enjoyable because its significant characters were all portrayed as miserable people with few redeeming qualities because the story allowed for none better.
B008EQIK90|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  While there are a few funny moments, overall this movie is a waste of money and time.  It's hard to believe that critics actually recommend this movie for anyone over 12 years old...and yet it's probably not appropriate for young eyes and ears.  Horrible Movie, don't waste your time and money!!!
0142419400|3.0|Some of this \\"I think he doesn't want me\\" is ok and is normal, but it continued throughout the entire book.  I felt the author was thinking \\"I must keep them apart.  They desire each other, but they must not tell each other until the very end.\\"  Several mis-communications create this delay.  For example, Etienne is drunk and says something to Anna.  The next day he hopes she will reciprocate.  But she does not because she thinks he did not mean it and would be embarrassed if she said anything.  So now he thinks \\"she doesn't like me otherwise she would have reciprocated to my drunk comment.\\"  Many romances use mis-communication and inaccurate assumptions.  I'm ok with a little but not as much as was used here.<br /><br />I rated this slightly above average because the surrounding story was good: the friends, the Paris location, the parents, and Anna's desire to be a film critic.  I enjoyed Anna's feelings and interactions with Etienne.  I enjoyed the anticipation.  Teen girls should like this.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Narrative mode: 1st person Anna.  Story length: 370 pages.  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words.  Sexual content: none, other than comments about couples who are sleeping together.  Setting: current day mostly Paris, France.  Copyright: 2010.  Genre: young adult contemporary romance.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Looks like a fun game I'd spend plenty of time on. Just one problem: The game isn't centered on my phone, as if it adds an extra grid, making it impossible for me to make a move on the right side of the game.<br />Is there a way to resolve this issue?

0061692042|4.0|Richard Ford, master American storyteller, has delivered another complex character study, this time of 15 year old Dell Parsons.  From the first sentences, \\"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later\\", Ford grabs the reader by the neck and assures you're not going anywhere.<br /><br />\\"Canada\\" is broken up into three sections and in my view the first section stands head and shoulders above the other two.  In fact, Ford should have title this book \\"Montana\\" because it is the true virtuoso performance of this three act set.  Dell narrates the book from a vantage point some 40 years later --- although we don't know where he has landed in his life until the last section --- and creates such a dramatic and suspenseful buildup to the fateful robbery in section 1.  The rich texture of the Parsons family, Bev Parsons, former Air Force bomber, and wife Neeva, along with twin sister Berner, builds such tension despite the hints Dell drops during his recollection.<br /><br />Dell is brought to Saskatchewan by his mother's friend, Mildred, to be taken care of by her brother Arthur.  Dell finds himself on the outskirts of Fort Royal, away from Arthur's direct supervision, in a ramshackle outpost with loner Charley Quarters.  Dell struggles to come to grips with the sudden dislocation from everything he knew and finds little guidance or normalcy north of the border.  While the writing was just as captivating in this section, I struggled with the turn of events that led to the murders Ford alludes to in the first sentences.  Ford did such a masterful job creating enough context to build the readers interest and at least passing understanding of what led to their decision to rob a bank that his lack of doing so with the events in section two let me down.<br /><br />Ford ultimately brings things back to a tight conclusion as Dell and Berner reacquaint themselves, but the frustration I had with the conclusion of section 2 is enough to keep me from giving this fine novel 5 stars.enough to keep me from giving this fine novel 5 stars.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|There is never a game where you absolutely positively HAVE to pay to advance any further. If there are, then I haven't seen one. And on another hand, it says you can configure controls to not allow in app purchases, so use it morons!!!
0345803507|5.0|Despite the somewhat questionable writing, as I've stated in reviews for the other two books in this trilogy, Fifty Shades Freed was an excellent read.  A nice finish to what began as a rather dark story.  It was wonderful to watch Christian Grey change throughout the series, to come into himself.<br /><br />I must say, however, my favorite part of the entire book was in the epilogue, when we got a little insight into what Grey was thinking when he interviewed Ana at the beginning of book one, and their encounter in the hardware later.  I would love to read this story again but from his point of view.  We were really left wondering what was going on in his head throughout the entire series.  Seeing him come so alive in the epilogue was a real treat.  I hope E.L. James is working on the entire story retold through Christian's eyes.  My Kindle is ready and waiting to download book 1.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love having the weather at my finger tips. And it is always updating so as to be as accurate as possible.
B00846REIS|5.0|Awesome book - hot and steamy.  The tone of 50 shades seemed very smooth to me while this book is a little rougher (tone only so far).  It is rare for me to be shocked and one part of this book shocked me and I loved not knowing it was coming.  Enjoy!
0307949486|5.0|So I would see every single person on the New York subway reading this book. Those had Kindles were also probably reading this book. And then the David Fincher film came out. I am a big fan of David Fincher, he's made some great films and to think he used Rooney Mara..I really wanted to watch it, the trailer rocked too. I'm glad I didn't and I got the book instead and read it.<br /><br />I felt the book is thoroughly encaputuring. Someone's gone missing and a family is obsessed with the missing person and it has been several years but they still wonder what happened to that missing teenager. One of the main characters is Mikael Blomkvist who is undergoing a tumultuous time in his life. Though he is not related to the family, somehow he is about to be assigned the task of figuring out the who, when and where.<br /><br />Enters Lizabeth Sandler (oh she's the girl with that dragon tattoo) and the book becomes even more interesting. You know the writing is the sort where the author dedicates one chapter to one character and then to another character's parallel life. It is STUNNING how the author keeps juggling with your mind and choice. Both characters keep on playing see-saw in their respective lives because they keep becoming more and more intriguing.<br /><br />The author explains the happenings, findings, details so well. I was shocked by the suspense but I found the struggle leading to it's UNCOVERING equally fascinating.<br /><br />You know I'm told the other two books are better. How is that even possible? I saw the film and was underwhelmed but was happy to see some places looked exactly like I thought I had imagined them. THE SUSPENSE IN THE FILM IS NOT HALF AS DISQUIETING AS THE ONE IN THE BOOK.<br /><br />Excellent plot, super finite characters, amazing end, great pace, perfect book.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a very time consuming game. And its probably one of the most addicting games I have ever played.

0765350386|5.0|Excellent book.  Interesting new \\"magic\\" system that keeps the reader engaged.  Would make for a very cool Matrix style movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely looooooooved the trilogy.  Its a must read..  Best of the lot is definitely the first book: The Hunger Games.  But surely u will keep on with the read until u have turned the last page of Mockingjay (3rd part).  As of now, I am in LOVE with the writings of Collins.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Weather+ is adequate, but I don't see any advantage over TWC, and I find the TWC presentation somewhat easier to read.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I got this book on my kindle as a present. It is well written and you learn both history and the human aspects in the relationship betwen these important leaders. You will find it very interesting, it is a reading that I strongly reccomend.
B003IWRE3I|5.0|This is one of those movies that plays in my head as a book would... not because it's based on a book, but because it's so realistic. I have to read the book now - I just downloaded it from Audible.

B006RED4GA|2.0|This movie is incredibly boring. Forty minutes in and absolutely NOTHING has happened. I was falling asleep. Had to switch it off.
0763657875|5.0|The reader is floating down the Thames through five fact-filled spreads featuring many of the most well known sites in London. Each spread has a theme, like Power, Pigeons and Premiers which showcases the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Leicester Square, 10 Downing Street, The British Museum, Nelson's Column and Big Ben. The final spread is a wonderful recreation of Tower Bridge that actually lifts to allow a ship through and a tribute to the London 2012 Olympic Games.  Not only do you see the splendid architecture of these iconic buildings from one angle, but just turn the book around to read dozens of facts about these glorious churches, museums, towers, columns, theaters, stores, homes and bridges. Each spread also includes mini-bios of famous Londoners: kings and queens, authors, composers, architects and artists. The author included a \\"can you find this game\\" and lots of fun facts about London - who knew there is a pair of Queen Victoria's underpants on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum? A definite must-see.  Great book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a time waster and it is free so I am not stoping u from buying this fun game
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this app, its great for when your bored, but every time you try to play a game there is an ad redirect. Which I find unnecessary,  banner ads don't bother me a bit, but opening up a browser window just gets plain irritating. I  also dislike having to play games 50 times just to get the money to purchase...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great because it has a variety of games that you can play and you earn more points to get more games. its really great and entertaining.

0143119680|2.0|I tried to like this book, I really did. It was difficult going for the first 200 pages, as the story meandered into semi-relevant exposition about the various supernatural beings that inhabit the world of the story, but I did like the details of teaching and researching at Oxford University (a place I'd like to visit), and the main character was witty and interesting. The second 200 pages became actually pretty interesting, and I thought that I might actually like this book (yes, I will give a book that much time for a build up-did the same with \\"Shantaram\\", and it was well worth the wait for payoff)... and then it devolved into a pretty unbelievable YA romance. *sigh*<br /><br />The parallels with \\"Twilight\\" were very clear from the beginning (A friend actually described it to me as \\"Twilight\\" for grown-ups, and she wasn't far wrong): pretty (but not too pretty, and completely unaware that she's pretty), intellectual girl, new place, falls for a brooding, bossypants vampire. Even the physical descriptions of the male protagonists are similar. We have stalking behaviour, the aforementioned bossypantsisness, danger from other supernatural beings, the works. What was troubling to me in both books is the way a reportedly strong, intelligent female seems to lose all sense of proportion (and ability to think) as soon as she falls in LUV. He watches her sleep? Oh, how cute! He tells her what she can and cannot do? Isn't his protectiveness ADORABLE? He practically pees on her to mark his territory? See previous response. And I haven't even mentioned how adorable he is when he 'marries' her without her knowledge... and that's okay? Weird.<br /><br />Harkness clearly did her homework in researching the historical portions of this book, and those were the parts that I enjoyed. For every sickening section of the main characters (neither one which I found likable after they fell in LUV), there would be a few pages that just sang: well-researched and written, interesting, full of accurate period detail. These moments kept me going. I did enjoy the male protagonist's mother and his best friend. They were haughty and witty by turns, and highly enjoyable. I did NOT enjoy the persistent over description of meals and clothing, and what was it with the smelling thing? Everyone smelled of something--no, make that TWO somethings: cinnamon AND cloves, honeysuckle AND cherries, grass AND hotdogs (well, I made that one up). That was just weird, and annoying after a while.<br /><br />Finally, where was the editor for this book? Of the 800 pages or so of this monster, at least 200 were double adjectives, useless adverbs,  over description of clothing and food, and junior high mooning over the boy the protagonist had a crush on. I'm completely serious when I say this book could have easily been at least a quarter slimmer with a good editing. Take out all the meanderings that led nowhere and circituous phrasing and you'd lose another 200 pages. At that point, the interesting story buried in the behemoth might have had the space to shine.of accurate period detail. These moments kept me going.

0345803485|4.0|I first saw the trilogy on Goodreads. It has become so popular now. Very different from what i thought it was going to be... This is a very sad and tragic love story, love those. People calling it \\"mommy porn\\" just creeps me the hell out. It doesn't really seem that pornographic to me. I wasn't shocked til page 430, and that wasn't totally crazy bad. Parts of the story were a bit slow going for me, but I liked how complicated the relationship was, felt more realistic that way. I've bought the other two books as well and i'm interested to see where Ana and Christian go from here, considering that goodbye at the end...shattered, heartbreaking, tear :(

0937381888|5.0|This is the book that broke the ice for me.  I had never brewed before but I had a kit, I really wanted to brew, but it seemed so intimidating with the little knowledge I had.  I read the first part of the book that gets you brewing without having to know too much about the process and it sounded pretty simple, so I got a kit and the book walked me through my first batch of beer.  That was a year ago and I'm making beer twice a month and bottling/kegging twice a month.  I've read the rest of the book a couple times and I constantly reference it.  This is a great book to have in your collection and I appreciate it's layout and direction.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a well composed app.  good data organization.  one feature I'd like to see is a travel Option, where I could track a specific city for a specific number of days.  I want to tell the program when I will be in a particular city and see the forecast when I get within the 15 day window.
0449011909|5.0|The reader for all of the Game of Throne books is excellent.  He is able to give life to the characters through different voices.  I would highly recommend all of these books on CD.
B007ZZKWHY|4.0|Of all the movies about Moon Nazis, this is definately one of them.<br /><br />I don't watch many B movies, but I have to say I enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />Pretty stupid, and the plot had holes, and at the end, I didn't care at all about the characters, but overall, it was worth my time and I will watch it again sometime when I am a little more awake.<br /><br />The effects are great for a movie like this.  I expected something more along the lines of the Trek fanfilms, but it is much better than that.  20 years ago, this would have been the type of effects that would have made Lucas jealous.  The weird thing about it is that when the movie starts, the effects are fairly horrid, but once the plot starts moving, the effects look really good.  Some of the CGI model complexity is impressive.  In fact, I would say overall the makers of the Atlas Shrugged films should look to these effects guys for their films.  Atlas Shrugged Part 1 suffered much more from effects than this film did.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is highly addictive. i started looking for golf apps and came across this and gave it a shot... haven't put it down since.
0670022950|5.0|I appreciate Steven Pinker's sense of humor since this book is not a fast read and the snippets of humor help. But the data is important and put together in a way that was very persuasive. I am also glad for his explanation of why so much of  his argument seems counter intuitive since this is a necessary part of the book and sure to be part of what everyone thinks as they read his arguments. The take away: literature is important for civilization and if we want to continue to progress we need to encourage people to read literature. We should especially focus on the literature that introduces us to strangers, people of other cultures, people we don't understand and may think our enemy. The more we read about them and put ourselves into their shoes the more we can empathize with them and be less inclined to burn cats - or burn them. I also really appreciate SP's TED talk on this subject as it has been an excellent discussion piece in class. Hopefully, it has also encouraged students to read this book even though I do not require it. The usual critique from students comes from those that do not understand his explanation of why the decline in violence seems counter intuitive since they are overwhelmingly susceptible to the power of the media and  violence seems to be all around them. Reminds me of Europeans that are afraid of visiting the US because of all the violence we have here.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun concept, but like MANY other users this game doesn't fit to my screen (X2) and no scrolling option. PLEASE FIX and I will change review.<br /><br />**EDIT** App has been fixed and fits my screen. I can see why its so addicting! Great to know developer updates!

1466401885|3.0|I found this book was a standard read, I liked the similarities to 50 shades, but it was like you were reading a book that should be ready by your younger sister or worse your daughter. I finished it and finished it within a week. So not to bad, just that I felt a little like a perv, perving on a young couples relationship (both main characters still at high school).
B007J4T2G8|2.0|All of the hype and previews I expected a lot more from this book.  It is very slow starting and somewhat stereo typed.  I have only read the first book but it does not tempt me to read  the other two. To me it seems like any other book with a lot of sexual undertones.  I do hope the other books get better.

034580404X|1.0|The book that everyone's talking about.  I got to page 50 and I simply got bored with the storyline and the characters.  I suppose I listened to the hype and expected something different? I think I will go back to re-reading 'A Small Lie' which is a good romantic and erotic story told well with characters I love. Unlike this one its one I can keep on my bookshelf and know I will find a need for reading it again.[[ASIN:0956492843 A Small Lie]]

030788743X|5.0|I completely fell in love with Ready Player One. At first, I was skeptical about the deluge of eighties/video game culture, but then I gradually didn't even care if I had no idea what the book was referencing and just wanted to go along for the ride. I always like my books to carry a deeper meaning, something to be pondered after the last page is turned-and I was delighted to find it here; Ready Player One isn't simply an adventurous brown bags to riches story, but more importantly, it's about how advancing technology may not be all that glitters and virtual reality has a cost. Ready Player One is just so fun and utterly addicting-like a video game. Every time I put it down, it would nudge at me in the corner of mind, time just slipped away while I was immersed in the novel. Now I see why this was amongst the top Sci-fi books of 2011; it's definitely my favorite read of the year so far.<br /><br />The Protagonist, Wade Watts aka. Parzival:<br />I admit, Wade is not the ideal knight in shining armor quester: he dedicates every minute of his spare time playing video games, immersed in virtual reality, and studying a dead guy. He spends 24-hours a day holed up in his apartment, ignoring the real world while he explores OASIS; this guy just screams wimp: he doesn't know how to deal with the real world, so he runs away from it. Aside from his impractical quest, he doesn't have a life, nor does he have \\"real\\" friends (at one point he buys a sex doll and talks to a computer.) Yet, we love following his journey, seeing him grow as an adult.<br /><br />Halliday<br />Creator of OASIS, socially inept, but filthy rich. He is also the most enigmatic character. Which leads me to ask: how could Halliday, being so removed from the real world, possibly even code such realistic worlds and characters? This guy didn't even talk to people and basically locked himself in a room for decades.<br /><br />It's A Geek Fest:<br />I'm completely clueless about 80s culture, and the references were just endless. The only thing I knew about classic video games was from a Steve Jobs biography I painstakingly read during high school (which was actually more than you'd think.) I didn't find it a big hindrance, and I'm sure the fans would love it more than I (and I already love this book to bits.)<br /><br />Romance:<br />There's a slight love story which I thought was was sweet, but Wade still came off a desperate fanboy and socially inept. I know most things worth having are worth fighting for but really-don't scare the girl into thinking you're a creep. I couldn't helping cringing while was reading the chat transcript between Wade and Art3mis; it reminded me so much of those cheesy, desperate, \\"romantic\\" Chatroulette/Omegle messages that would prompt any normal girl to disconnect (I'm a girl, I know.) I guess this is what happens when a guy writes romance.<br /><br />Ending:<br />Fairytale, much? I wasn't a big fan of the whole \\"let's solve everything with money\\" strategy (it often comes off as lay writing to me), and really I don't see why it was necessary other than to fill up pages with descriptions of opulence, I get enough of that in romance novels with multi-billionaires. Why do you need to the most advanced virtual reality gear when the cheap stuff will work just fine (unless you want to be even further removed from reality I guess)? However, I thought the prize (the one behind the bookcase) at the end of the contest was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Plot and Worldbuilding<br />Halliday's contest just screams fun, fun, fun-a virtual reality hunt for over two hundred billion dollars-who wouldn't want to win? It's a game within a game (inception!) But more compelling is the universe of OASIS which is the heart of the novel. OASIS is where dreams can come true, you can be anyone you want, science can be defied, planets can be built, stores can be set up, love can be found-and whose to say just because you don't meet a person face-to-face that your friendship isn't real? On the other side of the coin, the idea that people are living their real lives to feed a fake one is twisted. The lines between game and reality blur. In OASIS, you can go to a bar, order a drink, drink the drink with your avatar but that's only an illusion-you are still thirsty. Why would you spend money on a drink to watch yourself drink it, but never have it touch your lips? (But then again, I'm the girl who spent twenty bucks to dress up my MapleStory character, only to have my friends tell me my character looked ridiculous with fat lips) And the latest technology to make the simulation feel more real boggle my mind: why anyone would want to actually \\"feel\\" the sensation of being shot with laser rays is beyond me.<br /><br />Overall, I loved the novel despite a few minor caveats. I found myself rereading paragraphs just so I could savor the story. 372 pages have never felt so short. I highly recommend this book to everyone who loves an adventure, except maybe my grandparents...they can barely even check their email. Just be prepared to sit on that couch for hours, because you won't be able to tear your eyes away.t your friendship isn't real?

0486278077|5.0|I was looking aimlessly for books in a bookstore and my boyfriend happened to have heard of this and picked it out for me. I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection.

B003N5VOUO|5.0|This is just about the most amazing movie I have ever seen.  The writers and producers have done a masterful job of portraying deep humanity within the many conflicting groups thrown into the turmoil that 9/11 has imposed on us all.  In many respects, the film portrayed an Indian/Muslim Forrest Gump--only here, the protagonist was not developmentally disabled but a very intelligent man with Asperger Syndrome.  In this way, it incorporated vestiges of Rain Man as well.  Unfolding here, however, was a much more focused and poignant story than either of those two other great films.  While definitely written for an Indian audience, it is also a must-see for Americans.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have all of the Tap Games, which I love. However, I like this more. They are very similar in concept. You get animals, hatch eggs, collect coins, and feed them. This game is better, bc it doesn't take as long to grow your village and u collect money more frequently. Who doesn't like 2 collect money? Lol. It's also better artistically. The animals are beautiful. U have little animals walking around the map that u can touch to interact with, whereas on Tap Zoo u had to buy a park ranger, on here its free and u can touch them to c them move. I could go about how great this is forever, but I'll just mention a few more positives and end it. For your sake;) This app does not repuire wifi, so u can take it with u, &amp; play it anywhere. I always bated how the Pocket Gem games(tap zoo, etc) required u to he signed on to the Internet to work. Another huge positive about this is it actually gives out acorns. On Tap Zoo it would be stars and u had to buy them with your own money 2 get them. On here they give them 2 u when u play mini games or collect them in a random snow pile. I haven't bought any acorns &amp; I've had 200+ and I've only had this game about 6days. The acorns r used to spleen up the process of hatching an egg or buying some of the &quot;better&quot; items. 1 more thing b4 I end this. B4 I downloaded this app I read some reviews &amp; seen a lot of ppl complaining about the app freezing and shutting their Kindle down. I can assure u, that is a thing of the past, bc I have a Kindle Fire and I haven't had any issues with it. As far as there not being away out of it other than turning your Kindle off goes, well that's not true either. You need to push the &quot;Stuff&quot; button and your little arrow will come up at the bottom of your screen, then u can exit back to home as u normally would. I would recommend this to all ppl, adults and children......Adults just make sure u have your Amazon Acct password protected bc your child can accidently make purchases for coins and acorns. The packages go up to 100dollars. So its not somethin u wanna take a chance on:) U can put a lock on it through settings or go to Amazon.com

0345803485|1.0|I am certain after reading half of this crappy novel that the main character, Ana is modeled on the author.  To write with such conviction and clarity about the world of submissive and domination, surely she, the author has lived it...I think so.<br />I really hated this book, it's immature, Ana annoyed the hell out of me, she allows this guy, Christian Grey who is a weirdo and has a dungeon of sorts full of discipline and torture equipment to take over her life.  She is so naive, and at nearly 22 she's never had an orgasm until she meets Christian, falls in love with him at sight and allows him to drag her willingly into his weird and perverse world.  She is always blushing, chewing her lip or looking helplessly at her hands and when she acquiesces and starts calling him sir I can't take it anymore. There's a slave contract too and it's stupid to say the least that such a smart, college educated girl would fall for this revolting lifestyle.  She allows him total domination over her and doesn't seem to mind playing the stupid little fool.<br />And, after their first night together she now has the magical ability to orgasm at the very look of him or the slightest touch, and on top of that she can have 2 or 3 orgasms in a row and at his very command, come on Ana, come again for me and she does!!!unbelievable, and she can also orgasm in her sleep if she dreams about him..it's crazy, stupid crap.<br />Not for realists.
0679720200|1.0|The Stranger as translated by Matthew Ward has to be one of the sloppiest and most poorly written pieces of literature I've ever attempted to read.  It seemed like it was written by a seven year old, and I could only slog my way through eight pages before I threw \\"it\\" aside in disgust.  The only thing missing was crayola writing and backwards \\"R's\\".  I would like to cite an example from page 6.<br /><br />\\"Just then the caretaker came in behind me.  He must have been running.  He stuttered a little. 'We put the cover on, but I'm supposed to unscrew the casket so you can see her'.  He was moving toward the casket when I stopped him.  He said, 'You don't want to?'  I answered, 'No.'  He was quiet, and I was embarrassed because I felt I shouldn't have said that.\\"<br /><br />All the five star reviews for this novel are surely for another translation of the book.  I mean Albert Camus won a Nobel Prize in Literature, and this translation in no way, shape, or form represents that.<br /><br />Long story short, this translation of The Stranger is something I would gift to a person I didn't like.

034580404X|2.0|I really don't see what all the hub-bub is about. But, here is what I think of this series:<br />Of the three books, I thought the second book was the best. It had much more of a well developed plot and it wasn't so much of just different sex scenes joined together by some loose, hard to fathom drivel. My biggest complaint about this series of books is the horrible use of the language. The author repeats over and over again the same things, like:<br />\\"she bit her bottom lip\\"<br />\\"my inner goddess\\"<br />\\"laters\\"<br />\\"he fills me/i feel full\\"<br />\\"Fifty, Fifty, Fifty\\"<br />and the list goes on. Remember when you were in grade school and you had a assignment to write a 1000 word essay? But, you couldn't think of 1000 words so you just used the same ones over and over again...or you inserted words like 'the, and, or' about 80 times more than what was necessary? Well...that's kind of what this author did. It was very destracting.<br />I did like that the concept of the book was something kind of new (BDSM and all). I liked that Christian was so incredibly flawed. I also like the cute emails and such they sent to each other. But, at best all I can say is that these books were only ok. Fifty Shades Darker was a little better than the other two with more mystery and intrique involved.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I know all books must end, but this ending seemed rushed and implausible. The way it ended was not complete either, as it was an unsustainable existence for the major characters.<br /><br />The first third of the book was slow, the middle was great and the last third was a real disappointment.<br /><br />I wished I had not spent 12.99 for this.  It was worth 2.99, all due to the ending.
B005I6EVUG|2.0|I love this cover!  It's nice looking, feels great, but after about two weeks of use (I read daily), the top and bottom of the cover at the bend is wearing down to the material under the pretty red.  I'm really disappointed after having another (WAY cheaper) cover on my Fire before for almost a year with NO wear whatsoever at the same places.<br /><br />If I were to get another, I would also look for a cover with a closure of some sort.
8866131768|5.0|It took several days of searching and researching before I ordered this planner and I absolutely love it.  This style has days/dates on the left page and the right page is blank and lined for whatever thoughts you want to write down.  My style is to pick up whatever piece of paper is handy to write on and I never get organized.  This planner is going to change all that - in fact, on the front  it says \\"This year things are gonna be different.\\"<br /><br />There are various tables in the front and a pocket in the back with some cute stickers to use wherever.  It's hard covered and I do wish I'd gotten the soft cover because it's a little heavy to carry around in my purse, but then I have a lot of back pain.  I'm sure it'll be fine for a normal person.

This book is about a warrior or a leader in my opinion that  leads my an example or as I was a taught, \\" A leader is a person who serves those who he leads\\", and Adam Brown is and defines that meaning and beyond (and I say \\"is\\" because he's presence still lives on).<br />Im simple terms, buy this book and promise you, you will be grateful that you read it.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Since the first time I saw this film in theaters, I have really grown to love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. They are two of the best young talents we have in Hollywood today. The two of them have a unique charm on their own, so together they really bring this story to life in a way that could not have been anticipated on paper. Their chemistry is intoxicating. You can't help but feel invested in their relationship, so when the inevitable happens, it hurts that much more. I also loved their dynamic, and how they played off of the supporting cast. I should also mention little Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass and Let Me In). She played Tom's wise little sister with enough relationship advice to put Dr. Phil out of business.<br /><br />Mark Webb did a fantastic job behind the camera as well. He's put himself on my list of favorite filmmakers with this film and The Amazing Spider-Man. Music is a big part of this movie, and is another thing that makes it so great. The audio could be better, but it's more than sufficient. The picture quality is also pretty damn impressive, even if not reference quality. I hate it when they have Bollywood musical type dance numbers, but this movie was so great that it can get away with it. When I first saw this movie in its theatrical run, I liked it. I didn't love it like everyone else seemed to until giving it another shot on Blu-ray. It's a great movie. It's cute, and equally sad. Highly recommended.
B008645YEE|5.0|This score was everything I hoped it would be and then some. The chanting we hear in the trailers is in the track \\"Gotham's Reckoning;\\" however, we also hear the themes from the other two soundtracks. For example, \\"Fear Will Find You\\" has The Dark Knight Theme from \\"I'm Not a Hero\\" and the disc's exclusive bonus track \\"No Stone Unturned\\" has \\"Molossus,\\" \\"I'm Not a Hero,\\" and the Batman Begins piano theme for when Bruce remembers his parents in the track in different places, while still adding new themes and sounds. The score can be best described as music that takes the old themes and expounds on them. The actual tracks on the disc are great, and worthy of about four and a half stars in my opinion. \\"Mind If I Cut In?\\" is an excellent theme for Catwoman and portrays mystery with some darkness which the sample will display really well; \\"Imagine the Fire\\" is a great action track that takes \\"Molossus\\" and Bane's theme to create a very exciting and bold song; \\"Despair\\" starts slowly with the batman synthetic theme (the one used in Batman Begins when he disappears during the scene on the docks) and then culminates in the familiar batman two note brass theme; Finally, \\"Rise\\" sounds more like a credits song where many of the themes, old and new, are played through the longer song. The Bonus Tracks, on the other hand, give the score a stronger rating. As I already mentioned, \\"No Stone Unturned\\" is an excellent action piece. There is also \\"Risen from Darkness\\" which opens with the Batman synthetic sounds (the one which the credits open with-or the beginning of \\"A Watchful Guardian\\" for those who have that song) and moves into a more synthetic action song. \\"The End\\" is a very somber song that stays more of a background song, displaying sadness. The last of the bonus songs, \\"The Shadows Betray You\\" opens with background ominous music that builds and adds Bane's chanting theme with his instrumental theme from \\"Gotham's Reckoning,\\" staying at a steady pace that started with the background music.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this soundtrack. However, this soundtrack is not complete without the bonus songs, which means you need to to buy \\"The Shadows Betray You\\" and \\"The End\\" form iTunes individually and then buy the disc in order to get the rest of the bonus songs (The remix is available both from the disc and from iTunes so be careful not to buy it twice). As a bonus, the disc version also comes with a sticker of some kind that contains the bat symbol that is on the cover of the soundtrack. The sticker looks like it is a car window sticker. This soundtrack is a must have for the fans of the previous two scores because it blends the previous two scores in and makes great songs from the combination. Buy the soundtrack, you won't be disappointed.ackground music.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this soundtrack.

B001EOQWF8|5.0|When I first saw WALL-E back in theaters, to be honest, I wasn't very impressed. Sure I recognized that it was the most beautiful animated film ever made at the time, but the story didn't resonate with me. I wasn't moved by an impossible robot love story. A couple of years later, going against my memory of an unimpressive film, I decided to go ahead and buy it anyway. After watching it a second time, it was a completely new experience. The message this film has for the modern world of consumers is simply amazing, and necessary. No matter how much people may want to deny that we are destroying our planet, the repercussions are becoming more and more apparent. This movie is an animated family film, right? Most Pixar films are not that simple. WALL-E gave us a glimpse of a future that none of us should want to see come to fruition. The whole robot love story was amazing as well. The heft of the environmental message is so heavy, that it's easy to overlook the love story. I appreciate this film now that I am an older, more mature film enthusiast. What a difference graduating High School can make.<br /><br />Plus there are Sci-Fi references galore throughout the film. Most obvious being 2001: A Space Odyssey. I'm not a fan of Stanley Kubrick's \\"Masterpiece\\", but I loved the homage WALL-E paid to it. WALL-E is almost perfect. The Blu-ray transfer is top notch as well. This goes without saying, but Pixar is by far the most consistent studio making movies today. As far as films, and transfers go. Simply put, it's a work of art.

B000TGJ80I|5.0|I don't know about you guys, but I love the Underworld series. This series, along with Blade is what made me a fan of vampires films. Before then, I wrote them off because most of them are love stories. What I failed to realize it that they should be love stories, and I had a misconception of what vampires were all about. Abraham (\\"Bram\\") Stroker's original Dracula novel from 1897 was a love story through and through. Even Underworld is a love story at heart. The same argument could be made for Blade, since his love for his mother, and hatred for the monsters that stole her from him is what drove his quest for vengeance. Underworld is more like a Gothic Romeo and Juliet. The difference, and it's a big one, is that the second sexiest actress in the world stars as Selene. The first being Scarlett Johansson. And not only is the lead sexy, but the co-stars are two of my favorite British actors. I love Michael Sheen, and Bill Nighy is amazing. If Simon Pegg and Ian McKellen were in this, I don't know what I would do will all of that British awesomeness. Yes, I love the cast, but the action is pretty good in this movie as well. Comparisons to The Matrix have been made countless times. I don't blame anyone for doing so. Over the course of the franchise, Underworld has found its niche, and moved away from such comparisons.<br /><br />The finale  in the first Underworld is quite well done, in my opinion. I do happen to love werewolves as well. They are only my favorite movie monsters in cinema history. In fact, I just recently watched An American Werewolf In London because I did not feel right calling myself a fan of the beast, not having seen \\"The Best Werewolf Movie Of All-Time\\". That said, I don't think they were at their best in this one. They moved too slow to me. I appreciate prostetics over CGI, but make it more believable at least. There is no way a real werewolf would walk straight at someone that slowly if they were shooting at, or whipping it. I can't hold that against the film too much though, because that's only of sign of Underworld's lower budget, especially compared to its sequels. Van Helsing, while it isn't the best film, has some of my personal favorite werewolves. That said, I still enjoyed the R&J-esque story, and how it combined the already connected lores.<br /><br />The story is aided wonderfully by the dark tone and visuals. The gothic look was used perfectly. The vampires' home was a particularly well done set piece. As was the final set where the last fight took place. Speaking of that particular fight, I think it was a tad too short, but the choreography was nicely paced. It allowed you to see every detail, but it didn't move too slowly. I can say that for the entire film actually. The pacing is great, and the lack of quick-cuts allow to to become immersed in the Underworld universe. As a fan of the entire series, I may be biased. I can admit that I see the films' flaws, but still find much more to love in them. I don't blame anyone for not liking these movies, but I don't get the hate. I think it's a lot better than the reception it has received, and certainly worth a watch for anyone who likes vampires or werewolves. Also, you see how easy it is to write a review for vampire/werewolf love stories without bashing Twilight? Yes, it's very easy indeed. I think Twilight is just a female's version of this story. Even though the lead is a female, it is still a movie, or series that caters to a large male audience. And there isn't much that needs to be said for the picture and audio quality of the Blu-rays. Each film in the series is pretty much reference quality. Highly recommended.ainst the film too much though, because that's only of sign of Underworld's lower budget, especially compared to its sequels.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is not a movie. It's an experience. It's a lot of fun. It's based on a graphic novel (aren't all movies these days?) which pays homage to the classic arcade games that have become relics in the age of the video game console. Scott Pilgrim is very original and creative. I'm also not big on the kind of rock music played throughout the film, but this movie definitely has a killer soundtrack. The script is quirky, the scenery is vibrant, and the actors are all great. I especially loved our new Captain America, Chris Evans. Even Michael Cera is a lively one here, in what is probably his most unique role. The direction was great, and so was just about everything else. Edgar Wright is the pucking (you'll get that if you see it) man. This Blu-ray is one hell of a package on top of the fun film. Picture and audio are bliss. If you enjoy unique, lively, quirky films, then Scott Pilgrim is the whole package. The End. (Nintendo theme plays)

0345803485|1.0|Curiosity led me to  read these books.  After all, every talk show had hundreds of women touting it as the best read of the century.  Dr. Oz had women telling how it changed their lives.  I kept hoping the books would get better...toward the end I was hoping for one of the two main characters to die.  My analysis of the books is that it is the most poorly written piece of garbage on the New York Times Bestseller list...which I always thought reflected the best literature not the \\"most money\\" made.  New York Times I will trust you no longer!!!!  The writing wasn't  just immature \\"Later's Babe!!!\\"  it was just all around bad.  The content wasn't just trite and boring it was completely unrealistic.<br /><br />Sadly, I've analyzed the allure of this swill by the average lonely woman (in or out of a relationship)...the idea of a rich, gorgeous, and I repeat rich man sweeping you off your feet is quite compelling.  What's better is the idea that \\"your love\\" changed him...ie. \\"fixed him\\"....is a dream of a lifetime for every woman who might have a slightly \\"broken man\\".<br /><br />All in all, it was the biggest waste of my time that I cannot get back...oh well...I have hope that one day when I decide to write a book, I have very little to  compete against in order to become my own rich woman...without needing to be tied up, gagged, hand-cuffed, spanked, whipped, or humiliated to do it.

B00756GKBA|5.0|I am a huge Madonna fan and have been since the early 1980s, so I am biased, but I absolutely love this cd.  I feel it's way better than \\"Hard Candy,\\" which I also liked (and it probably contains my all-time fave Madonna song, \\"Voices\\"), but this just really brings Madonna back to her true self, I believe.<br /><br />The two song highlights off the CD for me are \\"I'm a Sinner\\" and \\"I Don't Give A.\\"  In the latter, the rap by Nicki Minaj is fantastic.  I also think \\"Girl Gone Wild,\\" \\"Some Girls,\\" and \\"Superstar\\" are great.<br /><br />If you get the deluxe version, which I recommend, you will also be able to enjoy \\"I F-ed Up,\\" which I just love.  We can all associate.  \\"Gang Bang\\" is entertaining - truly insane, and I am shocked she'd use it as track two, but it's Madonna and she can do what she wants.<br /><br />\\"Masterpiece\\" from her movie is included, which is nice.<br /><br />Probably my least fave song is \\"Falling Free.\\"  I find it interesting Madonna chose to release \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" and \\"Turn up the Radio,\\" as I think they fall short of the highlights of the cd.<br /><br />The upbeat tunes are fantastic to work out to - great stuff!  Madonna includes a song on this album called \\"I'm Addicted\\" in which she chants \\"M-D-N-A\\" toward the end.....true enough, because I am addicted to MDNA and can't wait to see her current tour backing this record.
0345803485|1.0|Honestly- I tried to like this book. When the last two recommendations I got from mass amounts of friends led me to wonderful reads (Middlesex and Hunger Games Trilogy), I was really excited to start these.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these read exactly like Meyer's Twilight books without the imagination or dare I say entertainment value (although I have to admit I actually enjoyed the Twilight books, guilty pleasure/low brow entertainment?). In fact, the relationship between our protagonists seems almost identical to Bella and Edward, and the writing is similarly, very juvenile.<br /><br />This book is predictable, the characters remain static, and nothing about the plot kept me interested... except certain chunks of the novel. I ended up speed reading through the snoozefest of what I came to see as \\"filler\\" between the raunchy bits.<br /><br />Then in an entirely expected turn of events- the raunchy bits too became boring and predictable. How disappointing. I would NOT recommend.

0307950689|3.0|Dan Brown takes you on another Robert Landon adventure. Interesting in some parts, drags on in other parts. I was surprise at the villain's true identity. It did take me a long time to finish this book, for some reason it did not hold my interest and attention as Angels and Demons or The The Da Vinci. Over all I'd say its pretty much an okay book.
0143119680|3.0|I do like learning new things. Really, I do. I just didn't expect to be dragged into an unwanted and tediously long lecture. The book contains a good helping of romance, alchemy, history and biology, and even dabbles into philosophy--the one subject I had a genuine interest in hearing more about. However, the way the book was structured and the amount of citations I encountered made me feel like I was digging into a thesis. A really boring one disguised as a thrilling adventure about a witch discovering her identity and falling in love with--surprise, surprise--a vampire.<br /><br />I had a hard time understanding the protagonists' reactions and felt further isolated by her extreme wealth of knowledge--everything from German to medieval history to French love songs. I'm the type who has to look up the background of a reference that I don't understand, which meant every other page I was lunging for my computer. And for all her bravado, I didn't feel Diana was on equal grounds with her lover when it came to decision-making. What's with these so-called \\"stubborn\\" girls and women masquerading as confident, independent women who cave to their vampire lovers' every whim?<br /><br />I would have given \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" two stars if not for a few passages and plot turns that made the rest of the novel almost bearable. Also, the fact that the author concentrated on the biological and philosophical consequences of differing species gave what could have been a dull, cliche romance a fresh perspective. If that sounds appealing, give it a try. Otherwise, for those of you who like a little more action and a little less referencing in their supernatural fiction, look elsewhere.

030758836X|5.0|(This is an entirely spoiler-free review)<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" intrigued me from the start--here was what looked like a rote thriller, by an author I was only dimly aware existed, and it was getting reviews portraying it as the best entry in the genre in years.  Expecting nothing (I'm used to being disappointed by so-called next big things) I dove in; and I realized, less than half way through, that this book deserves every bit of praise it's been given, and probably even more.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is the story of Nick and Amy, and their unhappy marriage that seems on the brink of total dissolution when they move from New York back to Missouri to be with his sick mother.  On the day of their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy suddenly goes missing, and all signs immediately indicate that Nick has done something horrible to his wife.  Normally, a book like this, with this sort of set up, would be all about stringing the reader along on a journey to find out what happened to Amy.  But Flynn is, frankly, a brilliant writer (or at least has this one brilliant idea), and \\"Gone Girl\\" is quite unlike any thriller you've ever read.<br /><br />First, the question of \\"What\\" is dispensed with by the halfway mark, as the reader becomes fully aware of exactly what the answer is to the central mystery: we find out, in great detail, exactly what has happened to Amy, and the second half of the book becomes a puzzle of why it has happened, and how it has been done.  It's darned risky, especially for a book that in so many ways is firmly grounded in the thriller genre, but Flynn pulls it off perfectly, drawing the reader in with well-drawn characters that we truly begin to believe in.<br /><br />And speaking of characters, Flynn takes another risk in that this is a book in which the only \\"good guys\\" we meet are mostly background characters.  The main characters are all so flawed that, indeed, to simply call them \\"flawed\\" seems like a gross understatement.  We meet some horrible, horrible people in this book, and it's a testament to Flynn's skill that we still care about them.  She does such a good job that when bad things happen to them the reader's immediate response is to feel bad for them, and then to feel bad for feeling bad.<br /><br />But again, the true wonder of this book is going through all the questions of how and why, and it's a journey that can't possibly feel like anything but a letdown by the end, if only because we've enjoyed the journey itself so much we don't WANT it to end.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is as close to perfect of a book as you're likely to come across for a very, very long while.  And I can probably give no greater praise for it than to say that even though I wasn't well acquainted with Gillian Flynn before \\"Gone Girl\\", I now feel the need to rush out and pick up her other novels as fast as I can.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|It's a good thing I rented it. This felt more like a visual allegory of regular teens trying to understand the changes still happening to them throughout teenhood. Especially when it comes to abuse and how one can have revenge fantasies.<br />This deals with a severely bullied teen, his cousin, and his cousin's friend, who befriends him, and what they discover about theirselves after discovering a very strange object underground after a party. The object doesn't get explained, but what's the need? The hints and implications are enough, and so are the powers that come from it. And what the guys do with said powers is at first outrageous. Pulling psychic pranks on people (like floating a teddy bear in front of a little girl, moving a woman's car without touching it, and turning on a leafblower to lift the skirts of a few girls). Then it gets to bigger stuff until an accident happens that questions their abilities and if they can use them for real or if they'll be having problems. What the bullied kid has is major issues stemming from how others see him as a total freak because he loves using his camera. People think he's spying on them, bash his camera (and him, not to mention spit on him), his alcohol father berates him just for locking his door so he won't come in and beat im up, and he seems most comfortable when he's completely alone.<br />Then their powers develop further with more use, and they try them out, almost harmlessly enough, yet things still go buck wild, especially with a teen-created superstorm (is that ever a good idea to do when it comes to a sharply bullied teenager? I doubt it). Then it gets to be more tragic. More troublesome, to the point of a city-wide showdown between cousin and cousin. What happens almost caused me to shed a tear. Almost. What did it was what happens afterward, something hinted at earlier in the film that hints at further sadness. Main thing I didn't like was how, even though it's apparent the technology to make this kind of film is getting much and much better, there were still a few spots that were obvious CGI (in other words, it didn't look realistic enough and you could tell). Which is sad, to be honest. Thi film had the potential, but I guess not the right budget to further those spots' visuals.film is getting much and much better, there were still a few spots that were obvious CGI (in other words, it didn't look realistic enough and you could tell).

B008JGSM6G|2.0|From what I could play in the initial, smaller grid levels I loved this. But as others have stated it is unplayable on a 4.3&quot; smart phone. Disappointed because it seems like a great game.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Sure, we have the creators of this show that came up with the concept and, to be sure, there are the characters that bring the show to life... but who really have the brains overall? Believe it or not, even though they're total brainiacs, it's not Sheldon or his totally egotistic roommate Sheldon (who has issues galore), I do believe it's their blonde neighbor, Penny, who definitely knows how to portray common sense effectively. And in each episode, where misadventures fire up all the time, I couldn't help but laugh my jaw off at each antic, especially the failed tactics of the live person counterpart of Pepy Lepew- Howard Horowitz. Almost felt like I needed a death certificate for laughing so hard each time.<br />As for Sheldon's attitude and cold, distant, nonpersonal way... I laughed real hard at what happens to him at the Physics Bowl (who would've guessed a janitor could actually be smart?). Not to mention Rajesh finding a way to actually talk to women (make that two, though I don't think the side effects will be wanted), oh, and can't forget Leslie Winkler and her forward, somewhat off-putting, yet very well-done character as the female version of the guys. And the chemistry between Leonard and Penny may be obvious, but it also works, very, very well. It's not blaring, it works equally with all the nerdish humor- his intelligence and awkwardness with her charm and ditziness. And if this is just the start-up, then let the bigger laughs begin when I get to season 2.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The first half was great.  It kept my interest and what you think is great character development.  Then, when it takes a huge plot turn, and you think, ahhh this is really getting interesting and original, it spirals down into a hugely depressing read.  It's two people who's lives have gone horribly wrong and both are just terrible, stupid people.  I wanted to throw my book across the room but it's a Kindle so I couldn't. I did think, \\"what a huge waste of time\\".  Don't bother.  It wasn't entertaining, just depressing as all get out. Shame on the author for such a let down.  It could have been wonderful if good finally won out over evil.  As it is, there is no payoff for hard money spent and hours of time I will never get back.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I bought this book for my kindle app on my ipad2 just because people were talking about S&M. It is not about that, once you start reading it, it is very hard to put down, especially when she meets him. I am not going to tell you what it's about, but to me, it's more about being submissive and enjoying every second of it. I think every women should read this book. I have yet to read all 3, and people have said they want to do to their husbands what he does to her. Well so far what he does to her, is fantastic. If it gets worse, in the rest of the series, I will let you know. Also going to a 50 shades of grey party, my daughter is having soon. Should be able to buy some pretty interesting items. Can't wait.
B000I52LUO|5.0|This reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock movie. It was very creepy and mysterious. The entire way it was shot with stark imagery and symbolism made it very interesting. It was not a feel good, or comfortable movie, still it was very moving. It did not leave a good feeling in me afterwards, but more of a wow, what was that? feeling. The second time I watched it, it made more sense. Certainly worth a viewing if you can take some downside imagery of life.

B00843TZJ2|3.0|The good:<br />(1) David and Graham's lead vocals sound strong and clear.<br />(2) Stephen's guitar playing is TOP NOTCH. The man's lead guitar burns away and he plays with a fire and conviction of a master.<br />(3) Kick-butt backing band. Great drumming and a tight ensemble sound<br />(4) Good value for the dollar. Two CDs and one DVD for less than $20.00.<br /><br />The not-so good:<br />(1) Stephen's voice is shot. As a huge Stills fan, this is a painful reality for me to accept. His harmonies waver a lot too.<br />(2) Because Stills' harmonies aren't spot-on, Crosby and Nash's vocalizing suffers too whenever Stills is part of the mix. Having seen C&N as a duo, they sound much better without Stills.<br />(3) The new songs, \\"Radio\\" and \\"Almost Gone\\" are nothing special and tend to meander. Their cover of \\"Girl From The North Country\\" is so-so, as well. It helps explain perhaps why the covers album project was shelved.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|Growing up on a healthy dose of The Muppets, I was so excited when I heard that Jason Segel was heading a revamp of the franchise.  It was like the little boy inside of me jumped for joy at the very thought of seeing one of these films through fresh eyes.  I told my daughter that I was taking her to see this film and she stared at me with this blank expression and uttered four words that stuck a dagger in my soul.<br /><br />\\"Who are The Muppets?\\"<br /><br />What has happened to children's entertainment?  Why are they fed nonsense in such an ingratiating manner, and if Sesame Street can survive, why have The Muppets all but died off?  I blame myself for not being assertive enough to force feed my daughter the shows I grew up on, and yet times have changed and I'm really busy!  Still, I was going to educate her, and so I thank Jason Segel for making my job a little easier.  I swooped up my daughter, called up my friend (who happens to have fathered her best friend) and we made our way to the local cinema for a daddy/daughter Muppet extravaganza.<br /><br />Totally worth it.<br /><br />My initial reaction after leaving the theater was one of unbridled glee.  I was in love with this movie.  From the moment Segel and company burst into song, dancing through the streets in brightly clad attire, I was brought back to my youth (early youth) and I honestly wanted to get up and dance.  I was so happy when my little angel actually did!  The film follows a little Muppet named Walter who grew up in a human house with his brother and best friend Gary.  When Walter and Gary learn that an oilman wants to destroy Muppet Theater in order to drill for oil, they set off to prevent that from happening.  Along the way, Walter finds his place in life, which is something he's struggled with growing up, never truly feeling at home even when he was at home.<br /><br />The way that the characters are explored here is fun and fresh, and Segel has fun integrating common movie clich&eacute;s in a way that is bright and humorous (as a way at poking fun at the typical rom-com).  There is so much joy in this film.  Upon reflection though, I have to admit that I was a tad let down by the finale.  I was waiting with baited breath for the actual `show' and when they finally put it one I was left wanting.  Sure, not at the moment (because, while in the moment, I was lapping it all up) but later as I thought about it, and when I saw it a second time, I was left with this feeling of disappointment, albeit slight.  The musical numbers were maybe too modern (clucking `Forget You' was a bit meh in my opinion) and it just didn't last long enough.<br /><br />That said, the original songs (including the Oscar winning `Muppet or a Man') are delicious and Chris Cooper is hilarious as the villain, Tex Richman.<br /><br />Maniacal laugh!!!!that is bright and humorous (as a way at poking fun at the typical rom-com).

0345803485|3.0|...when I first started reading \\"Grey\\".  Both books got a lot of publicity for similar reasons.  Can't help wonder if the publisher and author applied lessons learned from \\"The Harrad Experiment\\" in bringing \\"Grey\\" to the public.  I will be honest, I could not finish \\"Grey\\".  I read \\"Harrad\\" in high school and I suspect as a middle-age adult now I probably wouldn't finish it either.  I do recall \\"Harrad\\" as being more thought provoking then what I felt with \\"Grey\\". While \\"Grey\\" is more from the female point of view \\"Harrad\\" is more from the male point of view. If you enjoyed \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" then I also recommend \\"The Harrad Experiment\\" written by Robert H. Rimmer.
B005LLX582|4.0|Terrence Malick is one of those directors who divides audiences.  His films are so entrenched in who he is as a visionary that one cannot separate art from artist and thus his works all seem to carry a common bond that either draws us to them or repels us.  I have a typically fond relationship with Malick.  I find him fascinating, even when I find his film's bordering on self-indulgent.  He knows what he wants to say and he will stop at nothing to convey his message.  While I cannot say that I thoroughly enjoy all of his features, I can say that he is a director I respect immensely.<br /><br />For me, `The Tree of Life' is one of those instances where Malick's own vision got in the way of his storytelling.  He has such an important point to make regarding life affirmations, spirituality and the languishing effects of loss, but elements of this film take us out of that vision and strip away some of the effect.<br /><br />This is probably the most complex and captivating film of 2011, but its flaws (for me) pull it back from being one of the best.<br /><br />In broken fragments, Malick tells us the story of the O'Brien family.  It also tells the story of the birth of life here on earth.  In effect, it is telling the same story yet in alternating realities.  In the 50's, the O'Brien household is fractured by conflicting parental approaches.  Mrs. O'Brien is a loving and nurturing caretaker, while Mr. O'Brien is harsh, rigid and unapproachable.  As their three sons grow up, they are molded by the relationships formed with their parents.  In adulthood, it is obvious that their eldest son Jack is still haunted by his unhealthy relationship with his father.  Death weighs down on the family at one point, which is addressed on the film's outset and yet not wholly developed until later.<br /><br />The problem I have with `The Tree of Life' is the way in which the film is constructed.  You have three alternating storylines (the O'Brien family, the birth of life and Jack's adulthood) and they don't ever seem to mesh in a way that completes this story.  They feel too solitary, causing riffs in the way in which the film impacts the audience.  When sewn together or reflected on as a whole they can serve as powerful companion pieces, but in viewing they never truly feel connected or cohesive.  The way they weave in and out of one another feels almost lazy and reckless.  The segments regarding adult Jack serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever because they are so skeletal in development that they completely unearth the film and divert it.  Sure, they are beautifully shot and add some texture to the film's already stunning cinematography, but emotionally they add nothing.  The story of the birth of life is stunning to witness.  It is some of the most beautifully imagery and emotional clarity put to celluloid in recent memory, and yet their abrupt arrival feels a tad forced.  I wanted an organic segue and yet I was left wondering why Malick chose that particular spot for this spiritual departure.<br /><br />Pitt, Chastain and McCracken are all outstanding here.  Their performances should have all been up for Oscars, they are that organic and beautifully composed.<br /><br />As a whole, I really liked this film and I have a feeling that time could be kind to this and cause me to love it.  It is a film that certainly says more the more you debate it, but it doesn't necessarily say all that much while you watch it.  Like I said, Malick is a masterful filmmaker.  He has etched out some serious masterpieces in his time.  At times though, he can let his imaginations get the better of him and his vision becomes cloudy in his own hands.  `The Tree of Life' feels a tad cloudy, despite having a very rich story to tell.thood) and they don't ever seem to mesh in a way that completes this story.

B003Y5H574|4.0|I remember when the trailer for `Crazy, Stupid, Love' was released and the internet went abuzz because it looked so sweet and charming and adorable and just plain fun.  Then the reviews filtered in, mixed as they were, but general consensus was that the familiarity of the plot and likable nostalgic building of themes was enough to set this film apart and make it feel fresh and new despite recycling thoughts and sentiments from years past.<br /><br />I feel the same way.<br /><br />`Crazy, Stupid, Love', despite the obvious influx of sex jokes and promiscuous themes really is from another era.  The way in which the film is developed and the character's fleshed feels oddly nostalgic, as if it is from the golden age of romantic comedies and could have easily starred the likes of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.  Instead, we get Steve Carell and Julianne Moore, and they serve as wonderful hosts for Dan Fogelman's story.  Here we have a story of Cal and Emily Weaver.  They have what appears to be a good marriage and nice life until Emily drops a bombshell with the words divorce and affair and Cal's life starts to spin out of control.  Alone and desperate, he is taken under the wing of Jacob Palmer, a dedicated Casanova who swoons and lays whoever he pleases and he makes it his mission to turn the uncoordinated and geekish Cal into a middle aged version of himself.  It works, sort of, but Cal cannot shake the idea that Emily is where he belongs.  Trouble also starts to brew for Jacob once he meets Hannah and starts to form feelings that go beyond his shallow bedroom eyes.  In fact, love looms over the entire Weaver clan as young Robbie tries his hand at wooing his babysitter who happens to be harboring a crush on Cal.<br /><br />It's complicated.<br /><br />With inspired performances by Carell, Moore, Gosling and Stone not to mention a slew of memorable supporting performances by Marisa Tomei and America's Next Top Model contestant Analeigh Tipton, `Crazy, Stupid, Love' is sharp, funny and charming.  It isn't perfect, but what film is these days (actually, there are a few).  The jokes don't always work and there were some moments where it felt like it was either trying too hard, or not trying hard enough.  Alas, when it hits those marks, it hits them just right.  This isn't a particularly smart film, for the silliness of a lot of the scenes is what makes is so endearing, but then again, when is love ever anything but stupid?rp, funny and charming.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I selected this book based on Kindle reviews.  Honestly, I was reluctant because it was a Young Adult book, and I'm in my 30s. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the book; especially because this was the author's debut title.  The characters are well written, quirky and completely endearing...really adding to the story and how much you come to CARE about these characters.  These young adults face so much tragedy, take on big responsibilities, and are faced with making a moral/ethical decision that is the crux of the whole story.  I devoured this book in 2 evenings because I HAD to know how the story played out.  If you're on the fence about this book,  I recommend buying it.  Hopefully you'll enjoy the story as much ss I did!

I did get the similarities to Bella and Edward from the Twilight series but as I am a huge fan of that series also, I didn't mind.  I was a little shocked at the explicitness of the books but it does have a good story with it and when I was done reading the books I felt sad that I had no more to read.  One thing I didn't like about the books was the use of the same phrases over and over again but if you can get past that I think you will enjoy the books.  Have fun!

B008JAFXOQ|5.0|This movie, set in New York City, presents us with the seventeen-year-old Lisa (convincingly portrayed by Anna Paquin).  Kenneth Lonergan directs her, and a broad talented cast, in a powerful film concerning the results due to a major tragedy: Life-shattering results.<br /><br />The insightful J. Smith-Cameron portrays Joan, who does a poignant job as Lisa's rather confused mother.  She is bewildered but increasingly patient with Lisa while she starts a seemingly out of nowhere rebellion. Taking hit after hit from the daughter she no longer knows nor understands, beginning quickly and without warning.<br /><br />There isn't much character building for an audience to view before a horrific accident happens right in the very street in front of a young Lisa.  This is no ordinary occurrence, as it is so shocking and painfully real that I had to stop the film directly afterward to catch my own breath.  I was literally in tears for a while. That was how awestruck I was from this as it is so meticulously done along with Allison Janney as the victim at the scene with Lisa.  This immediately sets into motion the above-written series of conditions in the title of the review. A chain reaction, if you will. It's that sudden, that mercurial also. If this were a true story, Lisa would never have a hope of being the same person that she was again. This would change her life, her perspective and the way she reacts from this point on.<br /><br />It is usual that behavior becomes problematic after a traumatic incident, as each one is subjective to the person experiencing it. This occasion is to the extreme for Lisa, actually, it would be for anyone who would be forced to witness this. Trauma is a dance in hell.  The memory of it is written in indelible ink on one's psyche.<br /><br />The perfection in the facial expressions with the photography (Ryszard Lenczewski) and several director's still shots express so much of the oncoming symptoms that Lisa will begin projecting straight away. These are all branded during the lurid tragedy scene in the street; graphically filmed and superbly acted.<br /><br />Lisa becomes quite extroverted with her inflammatory statements and angry outbursts directed towards everyone, especially attacking and alienating her mother. She is self-medicating with certain drugs, rebellious and altogether confrontational. Lisa says of herself, &#34;I'm this mass of conflicting impulses&#34;.  With this statement, Lisa is very self-aware.  She also begins doing poorly in school while beforehand she was working towards a scholarship.  Along with getting into wrongful and ill-advised behaviors with certain teachers, especially Matt Damon, she is also with other boys.  It really does not matter to Lisa who the person may be, as she is becoming hyper-sexual.<br /><br />Lisa rapidly is painting a portrait of inappropriateness and she does not care one little bit about anything, with one exception. This being her initial statement given to the police at the time of the incident, as she obsessively starts seeking an end result to this issue.<br /><br />These stressful situations elevate to a fever pitch before the movie can conclude. Ending in a very subtle and a single outpouring of emotion.  Hopefully, Lisa can finally feel the warmth along with her mother that she has been keeping at arm's length and kept forcing out since she was traumatized.  Lisa begins to appear that she is on her way home again as she gets more and more honest with everything, but mainly, she gets honest with herself.y.

0192853619|3.0|Unfortunately, this is one of the books that I can't imagine who the intended audience is.  The reason is that the book has major problems in its construction.  First, as a Bachelor of mathematics, the book was far enough from being interesting that it took me quite a while to get through it.  I really can't imagine too many math majors or math grad students finding it interesting.  In fact, looking at the other reviews, my impression is that this book has received outstanding reviews on the basis of who wrote it, a brilliant mathematician, not on the book's actual merit.  Second, I think that it is too unstructured to be useful for someone who is, for the first time, encountering the mathematics in the book.  The feedback I have received from such students is that was unwieldy in this respect.<br /><br />In regard to the writing of the book, it is very well written, and it is incredibly readable.  If you understand the basic mathematics contained in this book, it will be a very smooth, quick read.  An added point of strength, for me, was that there were a couple of occasions where the author competently, and very appropriately, dealt with the philosophy of his subject matter.  If I had it my way, the book would have touched a bit more on the philosophy of mathematics, as was done in these two or three instances, making fine use of the author's expertise.  This is probably the only point of interest upon which I might be able to recommend this book.  I must also say that, like all of Oxford University Press' VSI series books, I think this book does possess a uniqueness, for those who might be interested in purchasing it.

B004UMIZSI|5.0|I can't get over the fact that I received my used copy of The Bell Jar for under $10.00. It was in great shape, and you could tell it is over 20 years old. There's just something about reading a used copy of a classic like The Bell Jar, I don't know how to explain it. Unlike the people who pretend to read on a Kindle or Ipad, I prefer a hard copy. And it sure beats the hell out of paying $30 for a new copy. Unlike an electronic reader, I didn't have to feel anxious about bringing it to the beach, or resting my beer on it. 10 out of 10.
B006X96PF6|4.0|As a connoisseur of Celtic music this is my fourth visit to Loreena's music. I love the way she has reinterpreted some of her earlier tunes and and some well know Irish music. I loved the way her performance of Wind That Shakes The Barley, Parting Glass and Down By The Sally Gardens help bring the words, usually buried under instrumental sound, into clearer to light so that the story and meaning of what is sung is more easily heard and appreciated. The pop guitar accompaniment of Bonny Swans is even better than her prior version. However, I have yet to warm to some of her new originals.
B002R22PB6|5.0|I had to view this movie for a class, but it didn't feel like homework - Bardem is great and he has a fantastic supporting cast. I highly encourage viewers to check out the background of Ramon Sampedro and his fight to end his own life.

The extra surprise at the end is pretty awesome too, be sure to watch past the final bows. Personal favorites: Wendy Ferguson as Carlotta, and Hadley Fraser as Raoul.
B00158K1DM|5.0|What a total classic and tribute to Toulouse LauTrec and his art. I'd forgotten that Zsa Zsa Gabor was famous for something other than \\"Green Acres\\" reruns. This makes a wonderful double feature with Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. The new Moulin Rouge? When you have seen the classic there is naught to compare....

B008D1LVRY|5.0|The first two albums, HELLYEAH and Stampede were good albums but I always thought they were missing something.  I didn't know what until I listened to Band of Brothers.  This albums kicks ass and takes no prisoners.  The album opens up shredding with War in Me.  Drink Drank Drunk is not only my early favorite off the album but possibly my favorite HELLYEAH song.  I'm sure this song is going to be a killer part of their live set.  The album does slow it down for one song, Between You and Nowhere, but its actually a great tune.  Another great thing about this album is that Vinnie Paul brings it strong on this album.  This is the album that I envisioned HELLYEAH to be.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|About 15 years ago, I read ATLAS SHRUGGED and tried to start THE FOUNTAINHEAD, but couldn't get beyond the first 5 pages. With the encouragement of a friend, I recently finished it.  I'm glad I did and don't understand why the book didn't interest me earlier.  The character development in THE FOUNTAINHEAD is far superior to ATLAS SHRUGGED.<br /><br />I have seen the film GONE WITH THE WIND (GWTW) an uncountable number of times.  I decided to read the book and learned that the book is better than the film.  Like GWTW, I saw the film THE FOUNTAINHEAD prior to reading the book.  UNlike GWTW, the acting in THE FOUNTAINHEAD is terrible. Although Gary Cooper was captivated by Rand's theoretical perspective, he was not acting, he merely read the lines.  Like GWTW, the book version of THE FOUNTAINHEAD is far superior to the film.  As I was reading THE FOUNTAINHEAD, I found myself realizing that I had seen the Dominique character in the past.  It took a long time, but in a slow unfolding series of page-turns, I came to the realization that Dominique shared many of the psychological characteristics of Scarlett O'Hara (bi-polar, in particular).  Since there are too many similarities to be a mere coincident, I think that Rand subconsciously used the Scarlett character.  For example, both authors glorify the raping of these women.  On a personal level, I found the raping description distressing. Since our cultural attitudes toward rape have changed, I suspect that if Mitchell and Rand were writing today, they would drop the rape scene.  The similarity becomes more obvious if one reads the 50th anniversary edition where Rand's original notes are included in the appendix.  However, the parallel between Howard Roark and Rhett Butler are not as clear cut.<br /><br />I find Ian Rand's work a wonderful paradox!  Although her religious belief structure is identical to Karl Marx, her intellectual pathway takes a different direction.  Listening to her interviews and reading her biography, one learns that she detested communism.  However, both her novels (ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD) address state-controlled capitalism.  That's far from Communism, that's Fascism.  It is not surprising to learn that Rand had little intellectual insight into Fascism.  Giovanni Gentile didn't write A DOCTRINE OF FASCISM until after Rand completed graduate school.  Her novels articulate the application of the framework presented in her academic works.  She doesn't acknowledge that Communism is an honest portrayal of an economic philosophy.  Communism does NOT endorse a free market; not even a state-controlled free market!  Fascism is more insidious and deceptive because it embraces capitalism without a true free market.  Within a Fascism structure, the state-controlled economy is regulated to enable the rich to become richer (except Jews).  Pragmatically, the government must have the support of the wealthy.  Sound familiar?  If Rand was born 15 years later, her books would have been richer and her theories more sound.  I wish she was writing today.<br /><br />After reading ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD (and other academic stuff), I don't understand how contemporary right-wing conservatives can envision Rand as their intellectual fountainhead.  I see her thoughts as being central to extreme left-wing as well.  Rand enables the extreme right and the extreme left to hold hands.<br />THE FOUNTAINHEAD has made me curious about Hitler's MEIN KAMPF: MY STRUGGLE.  That's what I will read next.ne learns that she detested communism.  However, both her novels (ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD) address state-controlled capitalism.

0345803485|1.0|I love to read, love erotica, love kinky stuff. I just couldn't overlook the writing, the characters, the dialogue, the story. So unimaginative and badly written, like the old bodice rippers my auntie used to read. As another reviewer said, it's like two 15-year-olds wrote it, except most of the 15-year-olds I know are too smart to write this. I bought it because i wanted to just read something easy and sexy after a bunch of heavy books, but this book is so bad I couldn't finish it. Don't waste your money or your time.
0345803485|1.0|I am a 24 year old women and am absolutely appalled at this book. What girl really wants this? Is this what literature has become? I mean I know it's a romance novel but heck why is it so popular?! I'm embarrassed that America finds this so amazing.
B007MU85D0|5.0|With a debut this strong, OMAM will definitely be hanging around for awhile. Do yourself a favor and pick this up asap. Sure to be one of the Top 5 or so albums of the year.

B004JN1D2I|4.0|These four books begin with an amazing start. The first book is a wonderful work of fantasy, one of the best of modern literature. The second book continues in the same lines going into more of the story and creating one of the most intricate plots I've ever seen. As the story progresses in these first books and even in the third you feel pulled in and want to know more and more. The character development is also amazingly and brilliantly accomplished.<br />However, I felt like the story became too large, in the fourth book there are already so many important sub-plots to the main plot that the author could not even contain them all in one book. Even though the books are exceptionally well written and the story is brilliant, the amount of reading you have to do to get to the development of a specific sub-plot is so long it sometimes makes the last book somewhat boring.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great game for all ages.  Yes you can purchase coin to advance the game but it isn't necessary.  Give it a try.  It is a lot of fun.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|The first book is in itself a wonderful work of fantasy. In this second book the author continues the story brilliantly and tells one of the best fantasy tales of modern literature. The book is extremely well written and leaves you wanting more and more of the story.<br />I definitely recommend this book for any reader out there, if your a fantasy lover you cannot miss it.

B004LWZW7E|1.0|Ugh...this flick has a bad story/plot filled with a bunch of people who try to look and sound cool but don't and most of them cannot act, especially Timberlake.  Seyfried slinks around exhibiting her transformation into a twig with a stupid look on her face.  A puke of a film.  Hardly even any unintentional comedy.  Pass on it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got flow free a few days ago and have been enjoying a lot. the levels do get more challenging as u go but not so difficult as to be frustrating. I have gotten perfect scores often the first time I do each puzzle. i started with the first group and now I am working on the second group and love having to think the puzzles through. I have had no issues and it plays beautifully on my kindle fire. I recommend flow free for any one.

I would reccommend this book to everyone. :))))) This story is from two points of views... Alex and Britney since the book is written this way you get to see their perspective on the same situations that occur throughout the book. All characters are explanied there are no gaps or places were you don't know whats going on. the book was written well. Every person I have lend the book to loved and purchased it. I have read the book countless times and have only had it a year. You won't be able to put it down once you've started. :)

The first half of the CD are fun, dance tracks that will have you singing and shaking your booty. The second half is slower songs and ballads that are filled with so much emotion. I would recommend purchasing the Deluxe Trespassing CD, because the bonus songs are fantastic and should not be missed.

1600242774|4.0|Yes...I've seen the movie....and Yes....the book was better than the movie....and Yes....they both made me cry....BUT probably not for the reason you might be thinking.<br /><br />John's father is autistic and such a sweet soul in his gentle way.  At the end of John's first leave....when he has just left Savannah after saying a heartbreaking goodbye...John is sitting in the kitchen with his dad and his so very sad and hurting and his dad comes over and does something that I have done so many times in my life when my children have been hurting...His dad put a gentle hand on his back and just stood there saying nothing but feeling everything....just wanting to take all the pain away thru his touch.....to save his child from such heartbreak.  I cried and cried and cried.......such a beautiful and tender moment.  Nicholas Sparks can write something so simple and make it touch you in a HUGE way.<br /><br />This was a good book......and it does pull at the ole heartstrings a few times and causes you to reflect on your own life and the times when you were dealing with a broken heart and loving someone you can't have.  Listening to this book was great for the narrator did a fabulous job of making the characters all come to life with their own personalities and voices.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I did really like this book, but I don't feel it was the \\"X-rated\\" version that everyone is talking about.  I feel it was a typical harlequin/romance novel with some spice because it included a fetish.  Nothing hard-core that wouldn't be shown in an \\"R\\" rated movie.  I do look forward to see if they make this into one or more movies.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome. its just so addicting and very fun. You should get it. You wont regret it. I know you wont

B0041KKYGU|5.0|The previews looked awesome, but I expected that all the good jokes were already given away.  Wrong!  Bad Teacher is really, really funny!  Lots of people will like it, but I think teachers will get an extra kick out of it.<br /><br />Everyone, but especially teachers, will enjoy watching Cameron do and say the things we wish we could.  (And plenty more that most teachers would never have dreamed of.)  While I in no way condone the behavior demonstrated in this movie, I think it makes an awesome bit of escapist fare.<br /><br />This movie goes well with Billy Madison, School of Rock, and Bad Santa.
B0045EJY90|1.0|Although having another CD player is nice, and being able to record to USB is great, YOUR ADD SAID \\"CD AND USB RECORDER\\".  Now, in a tight spot to record live speakers during our annual conference, I CANNOT.  You need to change your tag lines.  VERY DECEIVING.

B008CJ0KI8|2.0|i'm old school with music and the bottom its about your art with me and my ears. and musically this is a dime a dozen with alot of scattered good ideas and however not alot of balance. there are some versatile ideas that work in spots,however not enough to merit the hype because there aren't any money tracks on here which i can say oh you gotta hear this album or have this album, more like album tracks that are cool in places,however nothing that made me leap out of my chair or sofa.  vocally he is channel Boring to me,because while i can hear sentiments and a feeling there, the matieral and his overall tone tend to put me to sleep with quickness. he has some talent, just not what the  Hype Birds would have you believe. i look forward to hearing him do material which is a bit more challenging and complex.
B007R41E8O|5.0|very challenging. love it. frustrating twist s and turns. these games are way too much fun.  cant wait for more./
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Books, wine and tea... things I happen to enjoy. Sadly, reading about someone else enjoying them turns out to be very boring indeed. This story has an engaging plot which would have made a very interesting short story. Inserting a few hundred pages of sighs, smells, sips, tastes and touches to make it long enough for a novel was an unfortunate turn of events. Also, since I'm on a rant, there are only so many, \\"Don't believe everything you hear about vampires\\", lines one can stomach. I get it, you need to establish your arbitrary vampire folklore to support your plot, blech, who cares? Once you reach a tipping point where that majority of characters are supernatural (True Blood anyone?) the idea that all information on supernatural creatures has been kept secret for thousands of years loses its credibility. Just Google vampire and I'm sure you'll find out everything you need to know. ;)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As usual, this book was a captivating story of courage, fear, love and loss & romance.  Sparks has that way of pulling you  into the story as if you lived in the town of Southport, NC and could see it play out.  It was so exciting to be able to envision the characters in the book since the movie has already been cast and I think Josh & Julianne are the perfect Alex & Katie.  This was a great book...story pulled you in from the beginning & I couldn't put it down the last 10 or so chapters.  Highly recommend this book!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games Series and would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great story to read.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love all three of the books. At first I was not sure if this was something I would read but once I started reading I could not put my kindle down until I was done with all three books.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I don't like horror stories or vampires, but wanted to read this classic. It was very well written. I liked how Bram Stoker used journal entries, letters, telegrams, newspaper articles to tell the story! I was captivated from the first. I've heard about all the things that can stop vampires through the years--on other shows or by word of mouth--but was surprised that actually there are more ways.<br /><br />The only part I don't really understand is the insane patient who ate the flies and spiders. Wondering how he was connected, because he didn't seem to be drinking human blood. His connection helped them figure out some things, but it didn't really seem to fit otherwise.<br /><br />Another surprise for me is that when you are newly undead you apparently suck blood of children? That was also weird.<br /><br />After reading this, I understand references to Van Helsing or Mrs. Harker or Jonathan Harker. I recommend this book to all to read. It is a bit gruesome and harsh--especially how they have to \\"kill\\" the undead.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very good app. fun levels. and there are lots of them. good graphics. and I personally enjoy it more then the router type ones.

B007SGM084|5.0|I heard about Fifty Shades Trilogy and the more I heard, the more I wanted these books. AND boy did they live up to what everyone was talking about. After reading the first book it left you wanting more, you couldn't wait to get to the second book and then the third book.  You can't put these books down. The tension, the excitement, the wanting, hot so hot, the, the..........  A MUST READ!!!!!  Don't wait any longer.  You will regret if you do not buy these books.

1932100660|5.0|I was a vegetarian who felt great, but started eating large amounts of dairy and eggs to supplement my heavy physical training.  I felt like crap and was considering eating meat again (I thought that I needed more animal protein!) - but luckily I read this book first.  This book is truly life-changing....  I've been studying nutrition for a long time trying to find ANY answers just to run into one of the most conflicted fields with no information.  This book not only explains nutrition to the tee, it explains why other information is so conflicted.<br /><br />Listen up people, I'm a PhD student in the medical field and I am very familiar with good science and good research paradigms (as someone who does/reviews research for a living - it is amazing how easy it is to plan/analyze a study to make sure you get the results you want).  However, the research that backs up the claims in this book is GOOD, BROAD, SCIENTIFICALLY-SOUND research with amazing results.  This is why I feel so confident following these nutrition recommendations.<br /><br />A slight beware:  this book is rooted heavily in science, and the author explains the role and conducting of research, the difference in research paradigms, as well as how science operates.  However, EVEN THIS was incredibly fluent, easy to understand, insightful, and helpful to any level reader.<br /><br />Breath-taking book...
B003VANOFY|4.0|Opted to get the g930 after Days upon days of research. I originally wanted to get the playstation headset but decided not to since it only supports 2.0 stereo on pc. The sound is amazing and truly feels like the sound does surround You, the base is deep and sound never crackles. Average battery lasts me about 8 hours and can be used while the headset is recharging. The only con is that it can't be used on ps3 or Xbox 360, other than that this is an amazing headset, don't debate, it's well worth it.
0446572764|5.0|This book was extremely addicting. I cried in it, I laughed, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Great unique story, unlike anything else I have read in a long time. It was great to pick up a book and not want to put it down. I will be researching and reading this authors other books now!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is great for my preschooler!  it helps with hand eye coordination.  especially when he triesbto catch scratch running across the page.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Book 2 is much easier to get into than The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.  Hooks you right away, bringing in familiar characters and multiple plots.  Great writing style that keeps me from putting my Kindle down.
B007SGM084|1.0|This series was quite possibly one of the worst I have read.  The story was painfully juvenile with the main character developing very little over all three books.  Practically every page after the first 100 or so I just wished the book would end.  Not even the so-called \\"steamy\\" parts of the book could redeem it.  Whether taken as a romance novel or erotic fiction it utter fails.  Danielle Steele writes a better novel.
0345803485|3.0|OK, am I the only one who found the constant use of British-isms by \\"American\\" characters annoying? Come on, make the effort, at least! As for all the claims about safe sex, not realizing that the sharing of a toothbrush is an ultimate no-no. I just found the whole effort a bit...lazy. A.N. Roquelaure's Sleeping Beauty trilogy is a much better, professional read.
1423136802|5.0|Super fun books!  I picked them up because I had seen a lot of people reading them so it got me interested.  There were a lot of similarities to the Harry Potter series, I thought, but I didn't think they were quite as good, just because they are aimed at a younger audience.  However, as a 27-year-old, I still really enjoyed the whole series!  The great thing about them is that all 5 books are appropriate for any age, young or old.  I have  a full review of all five books where I go more in depth with each one posted here:<br />[...]<br /><br />Check that out for a full review!  But pick these books up!  You will enjoy them if you are into books in this genre.

0805086846|5.0|This book makes for compelling reading, which is a lucky thing because the anger and sadness it inspires would have otherwise compelled me to lay it aside well before finishing it.  As it is, I could only read a chapter a day before I had to set the book down in disgust at the crimes committed against the Indians in the name of \\"civilization\\" and \\"progress.\\"  Funny how those same wonderful attributes -- civilization and progress -- are used even today to justify so much appalling behavior, so much waste and stupidity.  But don't we all revere the wondrous wars and fantastic \\"entrepreneurship\\" of our country with its endless choices of products to buy if you play carefully and skillfully by the system's rules?  The Indians, of course, were outside those rules entirely... they merely wanted to live as they always had on land that had always been theirs; they were completely unprepared psychologically and militarily to deal with the cunning insanity and resourcefulness of the whites.  And so everything was taken from them... absolutely everything.  The Indians were hardly perfect in their conduct, but anything they did seems to pale in quantity and quality to the barbarism practiced by civilized whites.  And what were the Indians to do to defend themselves and enforce the treaties that had been repeatedly broken but, ultimately, kill whites?<br /><br />The only \\"good\\" thing about the history of the Indians who had the misfortune to be born in what was to become the United States is that they were not exterminated quite so systematically as the Indians of Latin America.  For an unforgettable account filled with unequalled savagery practiced by the Spaniards you can read Bartolome de las Casas' contemporaneous document, \\"A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies.\\"<br /><br />I do not know much of the history of the events portrayed in \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" outside of what I have read in this book, but if just one tenth of what this book describes is trueit is a monument to the arrogance, greed and depravity of our ancestors.  It is a must read for anyone even remotely concerned about the history of our country.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game.<br /><br />great game even my grandchildren love to play.  I can not get my kindel from them to be able to play myself.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I ordered this DVD over a year ago and didn't really start using it until six days ago.  For reference, I am somewhere between 5'5\\" and 5'6\\" and about 190 - 195 pounds, 25-years-old, and female.<br /><br />Every single day for the past six days, I have been using this DVD at level 1.  I have asthma and a heart problem, but I push through it - the only thing I do differently is that, because of the stress on my knees, I don't do the last circuit of jumping jacks... I run in place instead.  I sweat.  I push through the pain.  I grit my teeth and bear it when my muscles feel like jello.  So yes, I would say the workouts and pretty challenging and that's a great aspect of the DVD.  I can't even imagine what levels 2 and 3 will be like.<br /><br />However, in six days, I've seen literally NO results.  I have been following a low-GI meal plan (no white foods, nothing high in sugar, nothing processed), as well as no sodas, no red meats, no fast food, etc. for a few months too.  As far as I know, I'm doing everything right - but not a single inch, half inch, or pound lost.  It's very discouraging to put in the kind of effort that I am with no results!<br /><br />The clever little claim of this DVD is that you can lose \\"UP TO 20 pounds in 30 days!\\", meaning that you might not lose anything at all, or just one pound, but there's a potential for a 20-pound loss somehwere in there.  After nearly a week, I don't see how that could be possible.  Indeed, after reading the reviews, I am seeing a distinct lack of posts that include any type of weight loss or measurable progress; very few include the words, \\"It's been X days and I've lost X pounds/inches!\\"  This is very telling to me and causes me to suspect that, for all the effort, the payoff may not be to scale (pun not intended).<br /><br />I work 40 - 50 hours per week and have a four-year-old daughter.  I also do the majority of the cooking in the household to ensure that my diet remains intact.  Thusly, 26 minutes is about allI have on a daily basis to work out.  If the intention of using this DVD is to do multiple workouts throughout the day, doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of the, \\"30-Day Shred in Just 20 Minutes\\" selling point?  Additionally, if you are going to demand that I not take a break for \\"any longer than five seconds\\" and that \\"If I'm going to promise you big results in a small amount of time, I can't let you take a break during these twenty minutes,\\" then why should I assume I should be doing these workouts more than once per day?  That seems very misleading to me.<br /><br />I also agree with the other viewers - this is hell on your knees/ankles, ESPECIALLY if you are overweight.  Jillian also seems to have a very unfortunate focus on the legs in this DVD.  There's little to do with the arms and abs.  Most of the workouts are centered almost solely on the legs - even the ab workouts.  There's running in place/buttkicks, jumping rope, jumping jacks, transverse abdominal crunches (lifting the legs to crunch the lower abdomen), lunges, squats, bicycle crunches, sideways lunges... all of these place attention almost exclusively on the legs.  For abs, there's only traditional crunches and oblique crunches.  For arms, there's only push ups and another move where you lie on your back, extend your arms to the sides holding weights, and bring them over your chest, then back down again.  The \\"dumbbell press\\" forces you to squat, focusing mostly on your legs, even though it's supposedly an arm exercise, and the punches portion also forces you to squat.  You'll definitely feel the burn in your legs, NOT your arms.  In fact, I've had no soreness in my arms at all since using this DVD, only my legs - not even my abs.<br /><br />Something else I really disliked about the DVD is that they tell you \\"don't take a break.\\"  To me, this is borderline ignorant.  It encourages dehydration, and for people who are overweight, not taking a break can cause a number of problems.  No, you don't need to sit down, but come on - I can't even take thirty seconds for a drink or to catch my breath?  A lot of people subscribe to the \\"no water\\" method of working out and that's preposterous, in my opinion.  I watch my roommate do this with my DVD and he couldn't finish.  He started vomiting violently for about half an hour.  Some people see this as some kind of victory, but I see it as dangerous dehydration, and it offers NO incentive to continue on - I mean, why would you do something that's going to make you feel dizzy, nauseous, and vomit for half an hour afterwards?  I'm sure that Jillian doesn't promote injuring yourself in ANY way during a work out, as evidence by her attention to stretching and proper form, but she should have at least made it clear that you NEED to keep hydrated before, DURING, and after your workout - and made accommodations for this.<br /><br />As for positives, yes, this is an absolutely challenging DVD, and I've seen an increase in my endurance.  I feel healthier and I do enjoy the personal satisfaction of knowing that I can do it.  Jillian is very encouraging during the process and I do appreciate her personality.  Another reviewer said she curses during levels 1 and 2 - I haven't heard it, but maybe I'm so focused on the moves that I've turned it out.  She's been very motivational, in my opinion, and very down-to-earth.  I dislike excessive perkiness and appreciate Jililan's, \\"I know this is hard, but you *can* do it, and you deserve this.\\"  I cannot speak for levels 2 or 3.  They may be more diverse than what I have described above, and I do like that I have the option of moving up in level once level 1 becomes too routine for me.<br /><br />However, I am still disappointed by the lack of results and what I feel is a promise this DVD cannot keep.  I'll update this review once I've completed the first thirty days.  For reference, I will spend 10 days on each level, so once I hit level 2 I'll add my additional thoughts.
031620157X|5.0|this without a doubt my absolute favorite book. i have never read such a well written novel of fairy tales. words cannot express how proud i am of chris.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kind of slow at the beginning, but once it got going, it evolved into a real page-turner.  Characters were complex and plot was revealed slowly, with lots of surprises along the way.  Somewhat unsettling, but very interesting.  I recommend it, especially if you enjoy complex novels.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the most elegant, fun, well-done games I've ever gotten FREE for Android OS.  The devs  @Big Duck managed to create a puzzle with ease of use and a great learning curve (but you can choose to play ANY level at ANY time...no un-locking, etc.) that isn't a bore!  It's addictive!  Even the colors are bright and cheerful  w/out clashing or being garish.  This little gem is an awesome download and a true accomplishment.  Well done.
B001QOGYFO|3.0|U.S. Marshall, Carrie Stetko (played by Kate Beckinsdale), stumbles upon a murder in Antarctica. After reading the graphic novel I had to admit that some of the fun of the tale was taken away for me, especially as I felt the the latter captured the setting better than the movie. All said, it's a decent story for those who don't wish to track down the graphic novel.<br /><br />I found the investigation and presentation uneven and certain scenes which should have been milked more were rushed. Ever watch a movie and feel the pacing was just off? This is one of those movies. By the way on the Amazon DVD cover it looks more like Jennifer Aniston than Beckinsdale.<br /><br />Tom Skerritt costars as the doctor of the graphic novel, \\"Whiteout volume 1\\".<br /><br />The budget for this was $35M but it only made a bit over $17M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C to C plus; INVESTIGATION: C to C plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus.<br /><br />SPOILERS: They changed certain parts of the graphic novel. For starters where was the cool part where she was chasing one of the pilots and lost him and he was hiding in the plane? What about the Russian ally who helped her? They kept the guy with the pickaxe trying to kill Stetko and the run along the lines which is almost expected as that was one of the best panels of the graphic novel.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I couldn't put this book down...until I got to the end and wanted to throw it across the room! The author certainly has an excellent way of telling the story and sucking you into the characters. However, the ending was so lame that it was shocking and very disappointing. I wish I could give this book more than two stars, but a good ending is crucial to a good story.
1608871045|5.0|This is a wonderfully detailed book that is essential to any Batman fan. Provides descriptive information about everything mentioned in the description and the \\"pull-outs\\" are what makes this book unique (and more expensive.) Definitely worth it though!!

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|[[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer in that she can write the story and you become so entwined that you feel that you are there helping to fight in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The book is a must read and one that you will not want to put down from beginning to end.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Hunger Games Trilogy.
B004T6IBNY|5.0|Great product I thought that it played some like the real thing. I like the different layouts and the different levels on the board to play makes it a lot more fun.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying the talking Bible.  So easy to understand especially the names of people. I learn best by hearing and with this Bible I can read along and here.
0345803493|5.0|I Did not want to put the book down, it held my attention and left me wanting more. Make sure you have book three before you reach the end of this one!
034580404X|5.0|I saved a ton of money ordering the triogly off Amazon.  I am almost done with the first book and haven't noticed any defects.  The pages are a bit thin, but that doesn't bother me.  Great value!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|All the free music download apps I tried either crashed or didn't have the songs I wanted. This was perfect. Its easy search and download I couldn't ask for a better app. Thanks for finally creating a music download app that doesn't suck! Love it!
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I had the dark side of the moon record, and know every word on it... I've seen the Roher Waters tour, seen the documentaries everywhere... but this is the maximun collection about that great record!!! is beautiful, the live recordings and all the stuff sounds great and the view is great too
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was caught up in the book reading it from my grandson.  It was easy reading and exciting from the very beginning and all the way through.  I was about 1/2 way through the book when my grandson informed me I could purchase it through Kindle, which I did.  I would love to see the movie next.  I would recommend this book for every age.  As a grandmother, I have to keep up with my grandkids and we discuss things like this regular.
B005TZFYNE|2.0|Filled with fillers, Obviously  this album feels a bit rushed, But i thought the song \\"Birthday Cake\\" is good. Rihanna  really didnt need to re-record the song with chris brown. The opener 'You Da ONe ' with JayZis a ho hum, so so number. totally forgettable song and album. The only stand out is the club worthy \\"Where Have You Been\\". I still think 'Loud' is wayy better.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I think that this was one of the bst books yet. I loved how theo was acussed and u didnt find out to the very endof the book who actually did the crime. I give it a four out uf five becaise u dont find out if pete duffy really is a murderor or not.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|Beyonce, I have to ask you one question, have you run out of creative juices ? Reader, aside from upbeat numbers like \\"loVe on top\\" and \\"Party\\" , this album is merely filled with fillers and uninspired work. Bored me a lot. The only Beyonce album that defines real R & B is her debut 'dangerously in love'  album. After that,her  subsequent albums that failed a lot in comparison. Don't buy. So disappointing.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|i like these books because they hold my curiousity wanting to know what will happen next.  a great summer read trilogy and a great conversation piece. interested to see if the movie comes about.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game it is like the best.y'all that are thinking about getting this game get it it is like the bomb diggity
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This was a very weak story line.  I found it hard to follow the story and maintain any kind of interest.  The sex scenes were well written which makes me think this author used to write porn.  I won't bother with the other two unless I can read them for free and I'm really bored.
1401923127|1.0|This is probably the worst book on anything to do with science, medicine and healing I have ever read. As a medical student with a strong interest in spiritual healing I am offended by Lipton's brash mode of creating false dichotomies between nature and nurture and misrepresenting the interconnections between mind and body. Instead of being nuanced in his arguments and showing how the truth is to be found in between extremes, he goes on and on about the primacy of nature. Instead of deeply discussing the contribution and potential application of epigenetics, he simply hijacks the concept to support his one sided argument. His babble about belief creating energy waves that impact cells is again not nuanced or supported by evidence and he comes across as a fanatic rather than a thoughtful scientist and healer. He again misrepresents modern medicine painting the picture as one sided - ie modern medicine is based on newtonian physics and doesn't have a clue about quantum physics. His writing style I found highly irritating. I learned nothing from this book and wish I could get my time and money back.
0156030306|4.0|I don't normally read sci-fi but this was brilliant; it's the human story of a scientific procedure that takes a young man with learning difficulties and turns him into a genius. Charlie works in a menial capacity in a bakery where he reckons his workmates are his friends. His family no longer have contact with him; he attends special education classes in his spare time.<br />Narrated by Charlie, the progress reports begin as innocent, ill-spelt, childlike entries but after treatment we notice a gradual change as Charlie becomes highly literate and faces a plethora of new problems...As he begins to get to grips with his new persona- including realising that he was previously perceived as a 'joke' by his workmates and a non-person by the doctors- he has to face the possibility that the treatment might only offer temporary results...

1468161660|5.0|Such a wonderful, sweet, sad and heartwarming story!  I loved every single character!  I would like a follow up to Point of Retreat!!!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|What a great funny movie lol but serious as well. A must see movie its on DVD hurry and go get it.
0061537934|5.0|You know it's a good book when you are near the end, hoping for one last page to read. You know it's a great book when you read that one last page, close the book, and reflect upon it; not knowing what to do because the novel you just finished became so much apart of you that you wish it's story continued on page after page. \\"The Art Of Racing In The Rain,\\" by Garth Stein is indeed a great book.
0345536886|4.0|The Litigators definitely delivers the method of writing I have come to expect of John Grisham.  The story kept me interested from the very beginning as David Zinc decides the big, corporate law firm environment is not for him and in a non-traditional, off-the-cuff scheme, manages a way to break away.  I was uncertain as to what direction this character might go and that immediately caught my interest.  The story is very well written and delivers courtroom drama mixed with plenty of comic relief.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching the lawyers, Finley and Figg evolve, but more than anything could not put this book down before I had reached the outcome of David's journey.  This book is writing at its best and comes highly recommended, particularly for Grisham fans!
0060797509|5.0|How can anyone not enjoy these books...the take me back to the little house on the prairie show while I was growing up it was one of my favorite shows...now in my 30s love the books!!! they are great!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Totally compelling. Great psych insight into the ethical conflict between the D.A. and the father. Great insight into the conflicts kids bring into a marriage. A one night stay up all night read.
1439153663|5.0|I rate books based on how hard it was to put down.  Simple as that.  With this book I found myself thinking about the characters and worrying about them.  Sounds weird but the author really makes you feel like you know these people.  It's not a happy story by any means.  I almost wish there were more happy moments in the book but in reality I don't think being a slave would have many happy moments, so as easy as it would have been to write some in, I guess it was more truthful that the author didn't.  Once I was done with the book I felt really sad, but a good book should move you and this one did.  I LOVED the very end where the author discussed how she got some of her info.  It seems that some of the characters were based on real people.  My family has passed this book around to about 5 people so far, and all of us have liked it. :)
B0079NQZLE|5.0|Saw this back in 2001 or so. It's definitely stood up over the test of time, and I can highly recommend it to anyone.
B00821BLX4|2.0|I was surprised when I opened this package.  Olympus created a top notch TOUGH camera and makes a plastic attachment ring for the expansion lenses????<br /><br />I am very concerned about the durability.  This ring should have been aluminum throughout for durability and length of use.<br /><br />It does do a nice job of attaching the expansion lens but I did notice water leakage into the area between the lens and the camera.  It did not affect the quality of the pictures we took.<br /><br />7/27 update - well the camera has been subjected to lots of tests from both expansion lenses in lots of regular environments and it does seem to be durable.  I have not submitted it to a drop test and dont plan to for the cost of the ring!
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|SOS is classic city radio pop and danceclub mixer; Kisses Don't Lie shows the edge of emotional risk with irrevocable loss; Dem Haters is social justice; Final Goodbye means that you have already given me everything and I really will miss you more than I understand; Break It Off is americanized island music; and A Girl Like Me is your neighborhood crush.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|starts out very easy and then pulls you in. loads of fun. this game is a winner.  try it and you will not be disappointed
B00005AWMF|5.0|There are sixteen tracks.  All of the tracks complement each other.  The CD was released in 1994.  I remember buying it new.  Sade has no darkness in her heart for this album.  You can't drop from her love for you.  All that ever matters to her is your emotional success--no matter what the darkness in your heart.  The past is forgotten, and you have no future.  Even the now is limited by your personal loss.  She is determined, committed, fully alive, and absolutely right.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Nice variety of games. It takes time to unlock them all. Some games are easier to play using a stylus. Chances for bonus points &amp; game sale events.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I have both the library edition ebook and the library overdrive audio version. Melissa Harris-Perry recommended it on her show, Sunday, I think. Trouble is the ebook isn't showing up on my Kindle though I did the usual manual slide over. The Overdrive ended up on my PC and won't move to my Tablet where the ebook has shown up. Craziness!<br /><br />***<br />Okay, finished. Wow! What a book! It was very exciting! The narrator: Sarah Drew was excellent! I know there has to be a sequel as I really want to see what happens to the main character.<br />***<br />I looked it up. Yay! This is a series with a few more books to read!<br /><br />Hope our world never goes that weird and dark. Let love be free and crazy like it is! Must read!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. because I can create my world of ice age. you should get it .<br />  thanks :)
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|The shots of Paris are nice, and there are some laughs with the Hemingway character, but this movie is a little brainless. Poor Rachel MacAdams has to play a character who is unrealistically awful. And as is often the case in Woody Allen movies (remember Husbands and Wives?), the male character basically rationalizes his impulse to be unfaithful with the very convenient discovery that his partner is cheating on *him*.<br /><br />The problem isn't just that the movie isn't particularly smart. It's that it also makes the director seem like kind of a bad person who doesn't respect his audience's intelligence.
0525951652|1.0|My first book by Ken Follett - I thought the prose was simple, the characters broadly drawn, and the total effect was unrealistic and kind of boring. I made it through the first section and gave up.<br />I did learn some things about the causes of the Great War, the author did his homework - but didn't really end up caring about any of the characters. Maybe I'll try Pillars of the Earth - most people seemed to like that.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is very cool.a little slow but worth the wait.it is also very organied!so people should get this game!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game and I'm so glad to see it here. I played it on my iPhone however the screen did not do this game justice. On my HTC Amaze it is so much better!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it. easy and let me win. can single click to move certain cards. Fast response times and auto complete.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|Best hellyeah album to date. heavy metal at it's best. Much better than stampede.<br />\\"why does it alway\\"  is the only song on this album I don't care for.
B0054S6N04|4.0|I have read this book several times. I found it a great read. And yes, I have seen things on GMA that were taken from u-tube. On a slow day many inane things make it on to talk shows. The book had some parts I found very funny. Sam was a really hot undercover cop. Jaine his new neighbor, thought he was a drug dealing thug. He kept weird hours and had a sad looking piece of junk for a car. They get off to a rocky start, but theres a thin line between love and hate. Sparks fly right from the start between them. They do decide to marry a little too quickly for my taste, but he wants her committed to him. The killer wasn't too hard to figure out. I loved that the friends had issues, it made them more believable. I enjoyed the relationship the girls had. I would recommend this book.
1613771355|5.0|One of the most beautiful Graphic Novels of recent times.  Keeping the charm and magic of Peter S. Beagle's original masterpiece,  Renae De Liz's artwork breaths life into the story in its own unique way.  The coloring my Ray Dillon is first notch.  Just amazing.
B007PAAO0Y|2.0|Behind the pop glitzy production is barely discernible the soul legend, Bobby Womack. Disappointing. Good for a few listens maybe.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|keeps me occupied well enough. it's  a little hard sometimes to tell which tiles are blocked in and which aren't, ie graphics aren't stunning.
B002APU580|5.0|This is by far my favorite Pride and Prejudice version.  I think that Matthew Macfadyen is my favorite Mr. Darcy while Keira Knightley is a so-so Lizzy Bennet.  The rest of the cast makes this a 5/5 star rating for me!  Lizzy's sisters were perfectly cast and I really enjoyed the actress who plays her mother, Mrs. Bennet.  The music score is absolutely breathtaking as is the cinematography.  All in all, a great movie!
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Love this blu ray, saw the movie when it was released in the theater. Then ordered this and watched it three times in the first few days of receiving it.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|The Bourne Legacy does not feature Matt Damon's character, Jason Bourne.  Instead a new agent, Aaron Cross played by Jeremy Renner, is introduced.  Aaron Cross is similar to Jason Bourne in many ways and there are hints that he is a genetically improved version of the agents that Treadstone created.  Rachel Weisz plays Cross' romantic interest, Edward Norton plays the main antagonist, and Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Albert Finney, and Scott Glenn return as Landy, Vosen, Hirsch and Kramer, respectively, all from previous Bourne installments.<br /><br />The movie also attempts to tie in the previous Bourne movies and their plots into this installment.  Most interesting about this movie is that it builds on what we have learned in the last three movies, but promises that Jason Bourne was just the beginning and that the conspiracy is much larger than just the Treadstone project.<br /><br />After Treadstone was revealed by Bourne and Landy at the end of the third movie the CIA and top government officials attempt to erase all traces of Operation Outcome which includes disposing of Aaron Cross.  Operation Outcome is similar to Treadstone in that it creates assassins but the main difference is that the Outcome agents are 'created' with the use of genetic modification.  The central plot of the movie revolves around Renner's character, Aaron Cross, as he attempts to find more pills to sustain his super strength, intellect and ability, while dodging men sent to eliminate him and other Outcome agents.<br /><br />The movie itself started very slowly while they attempted to tie in everything from the last Bourne movie into this.  New scenes were inserted into Bourne film #3 to explain why the CIA was attempting to eliminate Project Outcome and then moves towards silencing Landy.  While it is much slower paced than the last Bourne film, the action scenes that were shown were amazing!  The rooftop chase was my favorite, and the ending seems much more carefree than the last threeBourne movies.  They also introduce LARX, another program where agents were genetically improved, and one of their agents goes after Cross.  Without any ties to Treadstone or Outcome, LARX seems to be given a free pass.  I wish more of that was explored or that the antagonist was harder to eliminate.  Hopefully there will be more to come!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|when I updated it it completely erased all my progress. I had to start over and the money I put into it was wasted. stupid game
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I absolutely adored the soundtrack to Pride & Prejudice which seemed to give the movie a soft, timeless, effervescent quality.  My favorite is A Postcard to Henry Purcell since it was inspired by his Rondeau from Abdelazer Suite.  Secret Life of Daydreams is also very light and pretty.  Not only is a perfect companion to the movie, but it's great background music as it evokes a light, calming atmosphere.
0316044695|5.0|If LONE SURVIVOR had been a novel, I would have condemned it for its unconvincing action sequences. Some moments are incredible. Which is one reason why the book is informative: It teaches us that reality is not always as mundane and predictable as our daily lives lead us to assume.<br /><br />The main story concerns four Navy special forces' soldiers who sneak into the Hindu Kush mountains in northeastern Afghanistan, on a mission to eliminate a leader of terrorists. Bad weather and terrain that offers no concealment result in detection. In bullet-saturated air, the four are forced to retreat. But despite that and other sorrowful occurrences, the end is happy. So do not despair.<br /><br />Much of the book, maybe even half, is not concerned with the mission. We follow the path of a young American who aspires to become a member of the United States Navy's elite special forces' unit called SEALs (not as in seal, the animal, but as in an acronym for sea, air, and land). We get an intimate account of the daunting training he must find it within himself to overcome, the glory of his successful graduation, and the camaraderie of his team members. When he is officially proclaimed missing in action, though the media announce him as probably killed in action, we join family members and a wide assortment of military and community friends who gather for a days-long vigil at the family home. Waiting for news.<br /><br />It is written first person by Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell, one of the four, and he is helped by novelist Patrick Robinson. Though I agree with Marcus's position, I would absolutely subtract at least one star from my rating because of his ranting against liberal media and politicians who crusade for the Rules of Engagement. Buyers of books like this expect a narration, not an editorial. Nevertheless, most of the book IS narration--an absorbing one--and I do not want to tarnish the book's image by a lowering of rating. It deserves to be read not just by patriotic Americans and fans of military lore, but by any person who deeply values freedoms of speech, press, and religion. Muslim extremists like the Taliban and al-Queda do not value them, especially when the religion is Judaism. Read Marcus Luttrell's story, however, and understand absolutely that these freedoms have champions, a stalwart group of modern knights called SEALs. But go ahead and exercise your freedom to skim through the editorializations so you can get to the parts that are extraordinary.t by patriotic Americans and fans of military lore, but by any person who deeply values freedoms of speech, press, and religion.

B0084LQQ82|3.0|I have been a fan of Supernatural since the beginning but Season Eight had a lot of hits and misses.  The leviathan storyline was fine, but the quick conclusion was completely insane!  After spending episode after episode of attempting to find them, kill them or get anywhere near them it takes Sam and Dean minutes to get into a fortress like building and dispatch Dick.  Nothing inventive, nothing exciting, just a little misdirection and he's dead. The saving grace was the ending.  I like the idea of exploring purgatory a bit more and really hope that they run with it.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book because it was a new and captivating plot.  After reading so many books, they all can start to be alike, but not this book!  The characters are rich and unique.  I was hanging on the edge of my seat reading as fast as possible to see what decisions they would make and the outcomes of those decisions.  I was actually scared, happy, disappointed and relieved with Victoria while reading about different parts of her life.  I was sorry when it was over and hope the author writes another book soon!
B000006U44|5.0|It's almost disturbing the way Kate Bush popped out of the womb with this her first album, already a fully formed genius. The songs show such a level of pop craftmanship that one might suspect there was some ghost writer helping out this young 19 year old (It's well known that she was discovered by Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour). But, being aware of the genius that would later make itself known, one can see that this album is indeed from her.<br /><br />What can one really say, except that if you've heard Wuthering Heights and loved it, you will be surprised at a whole album's worth of amazing songs. Why?-I ask myself,- doesn't this album get bogged down in dated, late seventies art rock pretension? and the answer is rather obvious if you read the paragraph prior: she's some sort of strange, otherworldly talent. Why also, hasn't this songwriter who can toss off pop songs like Paul McCartney, not garnered wider attention? Aside from the weird voice and being a woman, I would venture it was because she was a little too weird for the pop crowd and too pop for the weird crowd. At any rate, I'm enjoying discovering a great treasure trove of music from an artist that I've loved for a long time, but didn't realize how far and deep her oeuvre extended.

B0010SKUYM|3.0|THis is a very unusual read. At first it is hard to follow and I was confused about the plot and story line.  A few chapters in it becomes a narration of what led up to the first few chapters.  The main character is likable although a bit quirky.  The vocabulary is unusual as well.  Many made up words to fit the fantasy of the book.  Overall I enjoyed the read.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|My husband and I bought Season I out of curiosity because of the awards for Bryan Cranston. We were hooked after the first episode. The writing is spectacular and the cast is perfect. We have now watched all five seasons and can't wait for Season 6.  This is a must see series - it will keep you up at night pondering the implications of its plot.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|What appealed to me about this series from the beginning is beginning to sour me on this series.  I still rate it four stars because the writing, the complexity, and the fascination are all still there.  However, when I began the series in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" I lauded the book and the series for being unafraid to deal harshly with even the most sympathetic characters.  Now that we are this far in, I am finding that Martin is more harsh than the real histories he is modelling these on.  I am seriously wondering if anyone I have invested in emotionally will survive to the end of the series.  I am ok with morally ambiguous.  I am ok with everyone having a dark side: that is realistic.  But still there are people you like and identify with and there are people you don't like and I think there is really only one or two from the first book alive still that I actually care to follow their story.<br /><br />Seriously, Martin.  I am running out of interest.  If everyone I like is dead, I won't be reading anymore.  I don't read about characters I hate.

1609419693|4.0|Tina Fey's Bossypants was named Audiobook of the Year and the Goodread Choice Award for Best Humor in 2011. I'm glad I decided to listen to the audio version instead of reading it. I don't think I would have gotten the full Tina Fey experience without it. Some of the sarcasm or wittiness wouldn't have been lost by reading it.<br /><br />I didn't know much about her other than her being known for 30 Rock and her Palin imitations, but this chick seems cool. I think she is opinionated, sarcastic, witty and smart.  I like her. I'm not sure what's up with her cover photo, it's a little odd, but regardless don't let it stop you from listening to this audio.  She has a good mix of topics going on, from her stories about growing up, her teen years, her intimidating dad, bad jobs, bad dates, SNL, 30 Rock, it goes on and on. My favorite part were her \\"lessons for the work place\\". They are really ingenious and honestly just logical. All people should at least her her talk about that! It was also great to be able to listen to a SNL sketch of Fey doing her Sarah Palin imitation with Amy Polar (not sure about that spelling) impersonating as Hilary Clinton talking about equality and women. That was hilarious!<br /><br />Even if you're not a die hard SNL fan (such as myself), you'll still enjoy this audio book, I know I did.<br /><br />A few of my favorite quotes from Bossypants:<br /><br />\\"Bossypants Lesson #183: You can't boss people around if they don't really care.\\"<br />\\"This made no sense to me, probably because I speak English and have never had a head injury.\\"<br />\\"Do your thing and don't care if they like it.\\"<br />\\"Whatever the problem, be part of the solution. Don't just sit around raising questions and pointing out obstacles.\\"<br />\\"Never tell a crazy person he's crazy.\\"

My pop's got well over a hundred channels of television . I've got my ROKU and Netflix unlimited . When i saw that i could stream four of the stone films , i was pleased . I started with this one as the 2005 date was the earliest of the offerings . Great credit must go to a fine group of writers and a superb central performance by Mr. Selleck . This is an above average telefilm . Looks like the Networks still make some good features . Check it out .

0307592731|1.0|In the prologue, Strayed writes about accidentally losing her hiking boot over the side of a mountain while taking a rest on the PCT and then chucking her other boot after it because, alone, it is useless to her.  This representation of her aloneness seems like a decent hook: she is alone on the trail, her mother is dead, she is divorced and in these ways she is lost.  200+ pages later we learn that this desperate moment is not so desperate: she is about to meet her hiking buddies ahead of her on the trail and a new pair of boots from REI is waiting a few miles further along at the Post Office because she was soon going to discard both the boot that fell off the mountain and the boot she threw after it anyway.<br /><br />As a reader, I felt swindled by this hook, which is a microcosm of how I felt about reading most of Wild.  I felt like I wasted my time trying to invest myself in a best-seller simply because it was one.  I wonder: who edited Strayed's manuscript?  Her writing is repetitive.  Her insights are not insightful, but vague, shallow, and unoriginal.  Lots of people have watched their loved ones die.  Lots of people have been involved in unfaithful relationships.  Lots of people have become entangled in substance abuse.  The problem with Wild is that a large publishing house put a lot of its resources into marketing a book that lots of people could have written.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading about solitude and the wild, about something original and something beautiful, give Fire Season by Philip Connors, or Desert Solitaire, by Ed Abbey, a try.
1466401885|4.0|This book is such a page turner, if you liked 50 Shades this is another good one.  A bit more tenacious, but fun and a quick read.

1451648537|4.0|This book got me a bit worked up.  I tend to be impatient and read books in a few days, this one took longer and while I am absolutely fascinated by the story, I still wish I could get to the point faster.<br /><br />Great writing... super detailed account of Apple progression from the beginnings in a humble CA abode all the way to amazing financial, enterprise, and business results that changed the world.  Got me choked up towards the end and while I grew impatient with the book due to every glory detail listed, I also refused to put it down until I finished.  Steve Jobs -- wow, what a legacy you leave!  Thank you for all that you've done.<br /><br />Now, if you're not a curious/patient reader, technology or Apple fascinate, or a faithful iApple user.... you will struggle with this book -- it is thick, it is detailed, it is almost tiring.  Having said that, while I don't subscribe to the Apple fun club, I feel enriched by reading it.

0030839939|4.0|Overall I think the authors got this pretty much spot on in terms of content and level of detail. However, is it just me or are there consistent mistakes in their vector calculus?<br /><br />I seem to be consistently hitting walls in situations such as the harmonic potential approximation using Taylor's theorem, where the authors seem to have managed to simplify an expression by some means I have never encountered, which is missing from the text.<br /><br />I'm no mathematical genius, but I'm not a complete idiot either, and I am surprised at being confounded by such supposedly simple steps in this book. It doesn't seem to occur in other situations.<br /><br />Despite this, I have found the book enormously useful and rewarding, providing me with a very solid introduction from which to tackle my research (DFT calcs of material properties).<br /><br />However, as some other reviewers have suggested, it is long past time for an update. Some topics of current enormous significance (e.g. soft modes) are only mentioned in passing, not given the more thorough treatment they deserve. If the same level of presentation was maintained but applied to a more modern context another classic would result.<br /><br />I'd like to give it 5 stars, but when contrasted with other physics texts in which most relations are derived (e.g. McMahon's excellent Quantum Mechanics Demystified - with the typos corrected) it does fall a little short.

B005NQ94KS|3.0|Denmark-born director Lone Scherfig's follow-up to her critically acclaimed 2009 film \\"An Education\\" starring Carey Mulligan is not your typical romantic tale, for better or worse. By saying \\"not typical,\\" I mean the way the love story is told, not the story itself.<br /><br />In One day\\" the bitter-sweet story of romance between Dexter (Jim Sturgess) and Emma (Anne Hathaway with a Yorkshire accent) that spans more than twenty years is delivered in an unconventional fashion - most events take place on July 15th, from 1988 to 2011 - but once the narrative device is stripped away, the film starts to look more like a beautifully-shot soap opera that goes on and on.<br /><br />Based on a David Nicholls novel, \\"One Day\\" follows the story of Dexter and Emma spending the night together after their graduation from Edinburgh University. While Dexter goes on to become a successful (and notorious) TV show presenter, Emma, who really wants to be a writer, starts working as a schoolteacher. Their paths may diverge, but they are always united, keeping in touch with each other. Not a bad story.<br /><br />I was not disappointed with the storyline itself because I was anticipating a rather downbeat conclusion. What really annoyed me is the film's unconventional way of relating the story, which prevents convincing character developments. By sticking to the \\"One Day\\" format, the director fails to explain why Emma and Dexter, both of whom are seen dating with another boy/girlfriend, cannot live together from the beginning.<br /><br />While \\"One Day\\" makes a good point about time that goes on regardless of our life, its \\"romance\\" looks often very artificial, devoid of emotion. Time may fly, but not in this way.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i loved this book, truely i do. it touched me in ways most of the books i read can't. never once did i cry in the entire trilogy untill Prim died. and only then when it finally sunk in to katniss as well as buttercup that the person that they both loved is never returning to them. this is when i cried. this is the point in the whole trilogy that the inoccence of a child is lost. Prim was the purest form of goodness and now its gone... on an other note.. ifelt a certain emptiness after i finished the book. iagree with others when they say there really any true love scenes. it also bothered me that we didnt get to read when they &#34;grew together&#34; and i honestly think she could have told us how they did it, how he controlled his hijacking rage... these in my perspective could have made the book beter as well as leaving me wth hope other than hopelessness for both gale and peeta as well as rue's memory and most impotantly showing hope that katniss loved peeta because she did and she loved gale as well..... this is my opinion but over all i loved the trilogy.thank you
0345803485|4.0|After all the hype, after all the reviews here that pan the book, I finally decided to read it and draw my own conclusion. So after 8,000 reviews, here's my two cents.<br /><br />First of all, this is really a love story. It's about Christian and Ana meeting and the developing relationship. Is there sex? Yes, lots but I've read other novels that are as graphic or more by best selling authors. There is nothing extraordinary about the fact that these two characters have a lot of sex. Is there S&M? A little. But contrary to the media hype, this is really a very small part of the book and not really what should be the focus.<br /><br />Is Christian Grey an over controlling and domineering man? Absolutely, but Anastasia gives him a run for his money and puts him in his place. So she is not a victim, she actually is the one who begins controlling him.<br /><br />It is an entertaining read. It is easy to get through, not a classic novel based on superb writing, but it never claimed to be. There are plenty of bestsellers that are of the same caliber of skill. This was not awful to read. It was fun.<br /><br />Many women would love to meet a Christian Grey. He is charismatic, handsome, rich, and devotes himself completely to Anastasia. It's what you chose to do with him and how much you allow him to control you that is the crux of this situation - as Ana struggles with all the time.<br /><br />If you pick it up to read like any other novel, knowing that it will have graphic sex, it is a love story, it is not meant to be a literary classic, you will enjoy it. Just don't look for more than it claims it should be.

B0071XO8RA|3.0|I'm not a regular sci-fi reader, but after seeing the overwhelming number of positive reviews for Wool, I decided to take the plunge. Overall, I'm glad I did: the premise of the story was interesting, and the book has none of the ultra-annoying grammatical mistakes, misspellings and repetitive phrasing of some other self-published books I've read. Such things really get in the way for me as a reader, and I hardly detected any errors in the Wool stories. I really appreciated the obvious detail paid to editing this book.<br /><br />I found the story very interesting, but could only give it three stars for a couple reasons. Mainly because I found the pace to be WAY too slow. Perhaps this is because these started out as short (and then progressively longer) stories, but as I bought the omnibus edition I regarded the whole thing as one big book. Wool 2 in particular was difficult to get through, with virtually no action until the very end. Going down the stairs, blah blah blah. Going up the stairs, blah blah blah. I need some action! I also didn't have much attachment to any of the characters except Juliette, so later in the books when the story started jumping between characters, I got annoyed because the only story I really cared about was what was going on with her.<br /><br />There's a lot of compelling storylines left here, particularly what's going to happen with Juliette and the other characters we were introduced to late in the book. I'd be interested in reading more about that, but with less minutiae and more action.

B005LAIHSG|4.0|Does anyone remember back when rival Hollywood studios were putting out similar movies around the same time and there was the rush to get theirs out first thinking that the first one would take the majority of the box office?  I remember \\"Dante's Peak\\" and \\"Volcano\\" duking it out in this way, and especially \\"Deep Impact\\" and \\"Armageddon\\".  \\"Deep Impact\\" came out first but \\"Armageddon\\" sunk it at the box office because \\"Armageddon\\" was a boffo summer blockbuster popcorn flick with lots of edge of your seat action and big, splashy special effects.  \\"Deep Impact\\" suffered because it was marketed much in the same way but it was a substantially different movie; it was a female-centeric drama that centered on the end of the world.  Likewise this year with two new movies about the story of Snow White.  \\"Mirror Mirror\\", which came out before \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\", suffered at the box office even though it hit first but not because it wasn't a special effects movie or a drama; it came in second between these two because it was geared and marketed toward a smaller niche (pre- and adolescent teenage girls) and was made to be a smaller movie both in scope and tone (comedy).  \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is a big summer popcorn movie with great special effects and some decent sword and sandal action along with doses of magic (both black and white).  \\"Mirror Mirror\\" succeeded at what it was trying to do and was a fine and enjoyable movie but it was never going to match the moneymaking ability of this Snow White (and the stories between the two are very similar, unlike in the previous asteroid fests).<br /><br />SWATH stars a radiant Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna who has lived for centuries and has been moving from kingdom to kingdom inserting herself by dispatching kings in seductive and nefarious ways in order to take over their kingdoms.  She doesn't really like men and she's evil as evidenced by her attraction to earth tones and black.  That, and she sucks the lifeforce out of other women (guess she doesn't really like women either).  She has a twin brother, Finn, an almost albino sychophant that serves her because she keeps him young and powerful.  The story gives you the slightest backstory for her, enough to make you go \\"That's why she turned out so awful?\\" but not enough for you to really sympathize with her...because she's such a witch.  The other two main stars are Kristen Stewart as the eponymous Snow White (merely adequate, sorry all you \\"Twilight\\" fans) and Chris Hemsworth (the guy who plays \\"Thor\\") as the huntsman.  Hemsworth shows off some acting chops in a few scenes where he chews and spits out his dialogue like he was born to play a medieval ruffian (must be all of that \\"Thor\\" norse god work he'd done) and he gives you plenty of reason to root and cheer for him (he lost his lady; he doesn't like himself because he knows what type of person he is) while Stewart mostly runs around the forests and castle looking a little stunned.  At the end when she gives her speech rousing the rebel villagers it...wasn't...that...well, rousing.  If there had been no musical cues for the audience and the villagers they just might have looked at her and slowly turned away.  In some minor roles (and by minor I mean they were dwarfs) some mega good actors showed up: Ian McShane; Bob Hoskins; Ray Winstone; Nick Frost; Brendan Gleeson.  I recognized many of them and then, knowing that they weren't actual dwarfs and I was watching special effects, I focused on the special effects unfortunately.  They did a great acting job and I'm not kidding that they could turn a middling movie into a stellar outing; I'd watch a movie about these seven dwarves sans Snow White and the evil queen.  It would be awesome!  Fortunately for us this movie is much better than middling.  There is a very good narrative flow to the movie, likable and sympathetic characters, despicable characters for us to root against, some light action sequences, and plenty of magic afoot along with a few mystical creatures.  The love triangle, not terribly played up thankfully, between Snow White and her youthful friend turned fiery bowman warrior (William) and the huntsman was a little distracting especially because it was not resolved.  For myself (a dude) I was split between which of the warriors I wanted to see get the girl; I liked them both and felt bad that one of them was going to get their heart broke but this fairy tale ended too soon so we never got to see whom Snow White picks...but you can see it in her eyes.  You know.<br /><br />SWATH was very enjoyable and very well done.  I actually give it 4.5 stars.enty of magic afoot along with a few mystical creatures.

B003L77G06|5.0|This show is hilarious!!!! All of the characters fit perfectly into this comedic puzzle. I can't wait til season 3 comes out
B007MG360G|2.0|There is so little logic to this unlike Doodle God. kids may enjoy this version and its definitely more appropriate for them but adults should stick to God. the borders help but then its too short. without them it would be impossible because its so random. just trial and error.  . .
B0086700CM|3.0|it gets boring knowing u can't level up or anything. U just unlock achievements and thd different things n that's it
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is interesting, challenging, fun, and free! I think an 'undo' button would be helpful. The tablet levels can be solved on a phone, but a stylus is probably needed.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Always will always been one of my all-time favorites for romantic movies. With all of the recent fires in Colorado and the pictures of planes dropping chemicals upon the raging forests below, this movie is a timely one to watch. It takes you into a world of firefighters, who fight a war of a different type.  It's not only about pilots who fly old planes into danger zones, it's a story of love between a hot-shot pilot (Pete, played by Richard Dreyfuss) and his girl, Dorinda (played by Holly Hunter), who works with the crew. The analogy that love can either be a flash fire that burns quickly, or one that burns slowly and lasts, is part of the message buried within the story.<br /><br />The movie is a great comedy, with Goodman playing Al, who is another pilot who doesn't take the fool-hearty chances that Pete does.  Between the two of them, there are some great laughs throughout show.  However, Dorinda knows if Pete keeps up his antics of taking chances, one day his number is going to be up. She has that premonition and asks him to quit and take a job as a trainer instead.  Reluctantly, Pete finally agrees, but not before one last flight that takes his life.<br /><br />The remainder of the story is a fantasy-filled adventure of Pete haunting Dorinda and Al.  Dorinda, can't move on, and Pete can't seem to let go. Al, is crazy Al, only now he's smart and teaching the younger generation to fly the planes above burning timber.<br /><br />It's a moving and funny movie that I've liked for many years.  Dreyfuss is at his best.  Goodman is funny.  Holly is heartfelt in her grief.  The life and atmosphere of the men and women who risk their lives to put out forest fires is an educational watch indeed.  Well worth the time to see.
B007SUW24W|5.0|Ed Sheeran has collected a number of influences from The Chieftans to Van Morrison and Eminem and delivered a brilliant CD with a wide range of lyrical styles as well. A terrific new artist.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I beat the entire first play through.  I also had about 150 &quot;glu&quot; coins and several characters and powers fully leveled up.  Then I opened the app to find everything gone.  It wasn't because of an update or anything.  The app opened as if I'd never played before.  Effing waste of time!!!!!!!
0307352145|5.0|I wish this book existed before because it would have saved me tons of pain. I've read the introduction to the book and I had tears in my eyes. It finally all made sense. I discovered I was a closet introvert. For so long I was trying to be an extrovert because that is what I was told a normal successful person is supposed to be like. I was told I was a depressive person, that I was not normal, etc. I was told I had an inferiority complex, etc. And now I know. It is ok to be me. It is ok to want to stay home and read a book in a quiet room instead of going out. It is ok not to be bubbly and happy all the time. Thank you!
B007TR1R22|4.0|SPOILERS:  For those of us who have ever been in a toxic relationship; this movie will resonate with you.  No matter historical timeframe or culture this movie will strike a chord within you and you will completely understand the actions of the main characters.  I wanted to hate Freddie, I really did, but I didn't.  He never lied to Hester about their relationship.  There were no false professions of love and adoration.  He didn't ask her to do what she did to be with him.  Hester could not handle the overall guilt and shame of being in a relationship with him.  Freddie had to leave her to save her.  In his own damaged way he showed her he loved her by leaving.  I gave this movie 4 stars because like a previous review it was dis-jointed in places.  Overall it was very good and the acting was superb.  Like I said if you've ever been in a toxic, no win, relationship; this movie will have meaning for you.  Oh and unlike a previous review you don't have to be British to understand it.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I did download this game as a free app of the day.  The game was satisfying in length as I don't have alot of time to play at any one time.  The story revolves around a young woman plunged into a paranormal mystery.  Game is primarily search and find, the art quite good.  I would reccomend the game.
B000B589JI|4.0|I got right around what I expected. A quality item that will hold enough to fill a Zippo Windproof style lighter.<br /><br />Probably the only issue you could run into is if you do not screw the top on tight enough or if you strip the threads (NOTHING is idiot-proof), either of which could potentially cause leaking and/or a higher than normal evaporation rate.<br /><br />I can imagine this taking lots and lots of normal wear and tear, as well as some abuse, as it will probably get some abuse since it is owned by me.<br /><br />This canister comes with:<br /><br />- A flint screw tool for replacing the flint in your Zippo lighter<br />- A swivel clip, if you want to put it on a belt loop or something like that, for quick release<br />- 3 caps, two of which prevent leaks and evaporation<br />- A canister (duh)<br />- An air hole for easy pouring<br />- A split ring for putting on your keys
B002SRQ214|3.0|While this processor is great for the money, the stock heat sink/fan is practically a leafblower in both noise level and tone. It's essentially unusable. I would rather this be $10+ less and have spent that money towards an aftermarket solution
B007SYWFRM|3.0|i like this game. not really a game though. good graphics and animation. wish i had some friends playing this though. cant complete some of the missions unless i wanna spend all my special items.
