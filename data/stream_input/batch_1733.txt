0062197258|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this book but it was riveting and creepy. It truly made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.<br /><br />Given all the hype about the book Gone Girl, it was this book, and it's portrait of a psychopath that kept me in my seat.<br /><br />Truly a book I could not put down. An excellent first novel.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Everyone said book 2 was their favorite and I agree.  The story line kept you interested and it was hard to put the book down.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wild engages the reader from the beginning. Captures your interest from several different perspectives--love, loss, wilderness experience and lost toenails...all in one exceptional book.
081297381X|4.0|So many people seem to genuinely dislike Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  Is it envy?  Was it a personal slight?  Did he make them 'feel stupid' at some point? Not hard to do I imagine.  Taleb's brain and soul are a combination to be envied, and in the current cultural context, perhaps feared.<br /><br />He's in love with his idea, which is a good thing.  And with himself, maybe not such a good thing if it turns people off. Then again, I probably would be too were I that smart. I figure that he has survived Lebanon, cancer, Wall Street, and Massachusetts, and thus earned the right to brag a bit. Lucid analysis, epistemological practicality, and even some fun await if you're willing to invest the time and effort.<br /><br />I didn't find the book as intimidating as some have, but there are certainly a few \\"wait, back up, read again\\" moments. Just take the time to wrap your head around this and you won't be sorry.<br /><br />His is a damn good framework for addressing complexity.  An idea that can help us all - not just the rich and powerful - adapt to those events, both micro and macro, whose impact is huge but which are impossible to predict.<br /><br />I'm grateful for the man's thoughtfulness.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite films.  Nothing beats Bloom's lead role as a reluctant knight with a strong ethical compass.  The cinematography is simply stunning, as it is in all of Ridley Scott's films.  This is one of the best films ever made.
0545265355|4.0|The Hunger Games (Complete Trilogy) was really the first set of books outside of required readings I have ever read. I read through all three on my Kindle in about 72 hours. I could not put the books down. The books were very engaging and very effective using cliff hangers at the end of each book which led you straight to the next one. The Hunger Games made me realize that reading can be enjoyable and not just something that is required for class. The books will challenge what you think about government, personal freedom, sacrifice, love, and rebellion. Very good read.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The product is great and does exactally what it is susposed to do.  For the Kindle Fire it is great as the cords for these products do not last long and now I can purchase just a cord and not have to purchase the charger also.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book made me want to pack my backpack and hike the Pacific Crest Trail. I loved this book. I would like to read more books by this author.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome best game ever love it ooohhh ya love it get coins it is hypnotic to play get it it is the best of best
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved thus book. It's been a long time since I have read this kind of book. Very crazy book but it kept me hooked the whole way threw. I wish it went into more detail for the ending. I have already started reading one of her other books. Sharp objects.
B00846REIS|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure if it was a copy cat of fifty shades. I can't wait for the last book to come out in may.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|One of the best books one can read when the power goes out! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I received the audible trial when purchasing... Amazing!!! Jeff Cummings and Tim Curry make this book come to life!!!

B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Wonderful, family friendly movie that you will watch over and over.  Really enjoyed all of the music but the guitar licks were superb!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This is a bad ass album. I am a huge fan, and this album definitely delivers. It is a little similar to older albums of theirs. I highly recommend you pick it up.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It is worth the read. It kept me reading even when there was not a great deal of actual action happening. The ending left me wanting more, but I found the book entertaining and inpredictable. Celia Bowen is a fun character to try to wrap your mind around.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I have seen this movie on TV, on VHS and normal DVDs, but the detail of the film is far better than before. You will see things you never saw before or may have noticed but it was fuzzy. Not now. Absolutely worth the price to see it like this.
B008ULM7HU|4.0|This is an interesting collection of Birmingham's most succesful rock band from the 80's, specifically from that era. Although it was the decade Duran Duran had it's most succesful chart toppers, this collection ignores their latter year '90's hits, \\"Ordinary World\\", \\"Come Undone\\", and \\"(Reach Up For The) Sunrise\\" from 2004. It's a nice recap of their early year radio and video hits as well as album favorites and the ever popular non-album/b-sides that the average listener probably has never heard but \\"Duranies\\" have sought and treasured for years. Definitely order this if you've only ordered the previous hits only \\"Decade\\" from 1989 and \\"Greatest\\" from 1998 to add to your collection as Duran Duran have always made so many enjoyable songs other than the often played radio songs like \\"Rio\\" \\"Girls On Film\\" and \\"Wild Boys.\\"
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game. Does not require much energy of thought. Play until the coins run out and collect prides.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I am halfway through this book and am about ready to not read the second half---I usually love his books, but this one is sooooooooooooooo boring---I keep waiting for something to happen,but it just keeps plodding along---very disappointing---
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this app because it give's you the weather at an easy acess<br />the down side is it requires Internet.
B0036O0ELM|5.0|This is a wonderful recording. You can tell from his first entrance that Tito Gobbi loved to sing Verdi's Rigoletto. Di Stefano is dead right for the Duke - though, to be picky, I always find his very top notes too thin and white. Callas is gorgeous and even tones herself down for the innocent daughter of the jester.<br /><br />However, beware that there are some annoying cuts: part of the Rigoletto/ Gilda duet \\"Veglia o donna\\" and the Duke's cabaletta \\"Possente amor\\", but to hear Gobbi's close mic mezzavoce during \\"Piangi fanciulla\\" is worth the cost alone. Sure, he hams it up a bit at times, but who cares? He revelled in his art and he was a one-off interpreter of the great baritone roles.
B00026WU82|5.0|It's 1965. I'm in college, at a concert by folksinger Bob Dylan. He does his expected set, alone, with his guitar and blues harp. It's wonderful; everyone's happy. He takes an intermission. Comes back out on stage. The curtains behind him open . . . there's a BAND! A rock band, THE Band. He launches into the songs from his new album, \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", and everyone is electrified! Because HE is electrified - with electric guitars. I guess it was a big surprise to most people there, though he'd done this at the Newport Folk Festival to great outrage from Pete Seeger, for one. (No Internet then.)<br /><br />There were some boos. Dylan sat at the piano and was playing \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", while some idiot was booing. He sang, \\"... Something's happenin' and you don't know what it is / Do you, Mr. Jones?\\" The idiot booed and Bob muttered, \\"That's Mr. Jones.\\"<br /><br />This album is truly a groundbreaking piece of music history. I love it. It bridged a gap - folk music/rock music - in a flash, and broke down some carefully tended genre walls. Screw genres. Viva genius.
B0043GN6XU|2.0|Domingo's attempts at baritone roles is successful only because, in my opinion, he is an untouchable. People love him and his ventures into the baritone repertoire are celebrated, but he can ONLY be compared to other baritones in the role and as such he fails.<br /><br />Gobbi, Cappuccilli, Milnes, even Hampton, are all better by far. What is depressing is if you really want Simon Boccanegra on DVD you are overwhelmed with Domingo live performances. I do not deny his stature as one of the great 20th Century singers but that should not give him license to do anything without fair criticism.<br /><br />Domingo is not a baritone, and while his stage presence might fill the shoes of Boccanegra, his thin, hollow \\"baritone\\" voice does not.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|This cable came up in a search when i was looking for a new charger for the kindle.  The Cable works just as it should, but you can't charge a Kindle Fire that way.  So I wasn't useful at all for what I needed it for, and I was unaware of that until well after I purchased it.
B000B5Y00U|5.0|If you want an uncut recording that ticks all the boxes then this is it. Yes, I'm aware I'm excluding Callas, Cotrubas, and Scotto to name a few, but Caballe does it all here. The supporting cast of Bergonzi and a young Sherrill Milnes are magnificence. If you want the long version read the other reviews.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|An interesting look at the CIA, FBI and the lives of the individuals involved.  Just when you think you know what's happening, something changes and you realize you were wrong, but then there's another lead ... can't wait for the next episode ... every time!!!
B000002OVJ|4.0|My husband is a huge Who fan and this is one of his favorite albums..Oops, I mean cd's! Showing my age..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game id great fun. It is essy enough to complete all levels in a short time, yet engaging enough to want to. I will probably go through the levels a few more times.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I've been a long time fan of cable drama's. I like my TV to be edgier and and not as pc as network drama's. Starting with The Soprano's years ago up until recent shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men, TV has been consistently getting better and better. I'm late in the game to Homeland, but having spent the last week of my life watching Season 1 (and getting caught up in with the first few episodes of Season 2), I have to claim this show as my absolute favourite. The characters, the plot lines, keeping me on the edge of my seat..I'm hooked! My husband has been away for a week and I can't wait for him to get home so I can re-watch Season 1 with him all over again. Don't walk, run the the store to get this DVD. You won't be disappointed.
B009SCRERI|5.0|Cute movie. My toddler enjoys watching it on long car trips.<br /> Not too long of a movie, but worth the cost of purchase.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Ha ha ha . That book was amazing!!! I just love it and I couldn't put it down for one minute. I can't wait for the next one!
0545425115|5.0|As if you have not heard already, The Hunger Games is currently one of the most popular book series to hit the shelves.  The novels take place in the country of Panem, otherwise known as the post-apocalyptic North America where every year the Capitol puts on an event called the Hunger Games.  Two teenagers from each of the 13 districts are randomly selected to participate in the games where they will fight till the death until only one remains.  Not only are there gruesome killings, but the entire game is also broadcast as entertainment to those residing in Panem.<br /><br />In the first book, we are introduced to Katniss Everdeen from the poor, coal mining District 13.  She is strong willed woman who has perfected the technique of using a bow and arrow and who turns out to be a tribute for her district.  The other tribute, Peeta Malark, is the complete opposite personality of Katniss in that he is shy and would rather decorate cakes than hunt.  Once in the games, both tributes discover tactics and strengths that they both employ to keep themselves and one other alive.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy explores the meaning of spectatorship in our society as well as questions the hierarchical system along with power corruption.  If readers consider for a moment how spectators are perceived in Panem and then think back to what the readers are doing they will find that they are spectators also.  As the people of Panem are watching the Hunger Games, are we as readers not also exhibiting the same behavior?  The sense of enjoyment that our society receives by watching others is explored throughout each book and becomes an interesting aspect to consider when looking at our own society.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a modern novel that creates not only a fast paced plot, but also develops a dynamic set of characters that strike a chord among readers.  Setting the stage for the next two installments, The Hunger Games is effective in portraying the underlying corruption inPanem and how the journey of Katniss and Peeta opens up questions behind the Capitol's real intentions.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Sometimes I need to play a game  that makes me think about only the game and forget the rest of what life has dealt. I love spider solitaire! it helps me get calm and ready to rest. : )
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun and addicting. didn't think I would like it but I got hooked. hats waiting for coins but that's the only bad part....so far.
B009Y2KGSQ|5.0|I do not understand all the negative comments about this album- for me I have been enjoying the entire album from start to finish. This is a fun album and reminds me of a time when rock music was fun and not to be taken too seriously. Since this album is sinking fast in the charts- (I notice how quickly it moved down the charts on amazon and iTunes)- Aerosmith must be getting too old and out of touch- just like me:)
B00144VBBS|5.0|I ordered this CD because of the song Mockingbird.  The entire album is great,  I have listened to both CD's numerous times and never seem to get bored.  There is an assortment of types of songs.  Wonderful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|In order to be successful, a game must be simple enough to begin that even the most challenged user can get past the first 2-3 levels. Further, it must be challenging enough that the average user cannot simply blow through the entire game in a few minutes. This game satisfies both criteria. Its intuitive gameplay is so easy that my 4 year old knows how to play; yet, I have not been able to finish the hardest levels yet (and it has been more than 2 weeks). I am confident that I will figure these out, but they do cause you to really think and strategize.<br /><br />5 stars. Well worth the download.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read &lt;3 this book so much I have bought it for my friends and all the woman in my life. Colleen Hoover she is the best..... &lt;3
B008DVJMAW|5.0|This is an outstanding album by a great band.  These guys are going to take off like rockets!!!  If you like Southern rock this one is for you!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Each book in the trilogy just got better.  The storyline was fantastic.  The characters seemed real and believable.  I could not put the book down.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Love this movie, and love the music in it even more! It's a great mix if drama, story, and humor.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this case, I really do. It is a much better experience than I have had with my Nook Color case. In this one there are four elastic corners that hold it in place, so no flopping out as I rotate my screen. It's awesome that I can read in bed, with the cover flap open and my husband over to the left is no longer bothered by the little bit of light coming through even on night view. It is definitely easy to hold in my hand, and a soft material that feels good too. It is light and doesn't add much bother. The design is gorgeous and just what I need. It's a product that fits me perfectly. I'd recommend it and buy it again.<br /><br />Edit to add and update four years later from my original 2012 review. Now in 2016, my device is still amazing and I still love this cover but the bend has started flaking on the interior and the spine on the outside. We've covered it with a themed duct tape that is prolonging the life, but it appears to have a lifespan of a good four years of heavy, daily use.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This was a great season.  Good acting throughout.  Well-placed cast.  Jessica Lange delivers.  Many of the classic themes played througout - mixed together to brew something unique.  I very much enjoyed the nods to popular culture of days past.  Don't expect it reveal itself in one or two episodes - you have to let this one simmer.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I think she did a good job but not as good as Harry Potter. It was quite suspenseful. I would be glad to recommend it.
B005PK553C|5.0|The first season of this show is genuinely scary! One of the two shows on television that provide some extremely scary and creepy moments. (Walking Dead is the other). It being on FX, they are allowed to show a little more and push the boundries. If you're looking for a well done show that will freak you out, go with American Horror Story
1878424319|5.0|Its amazing the lessons beliefs and fears that are instilled in us for generations. This work of art was truly an eye opener!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game and play it daily! Easy, fast and no problems! And it was free. :) can't beat that!
B000WS4OZM|5.0|This is by far a very good CD, I like Johnny Cash anyway and wanted something a bit different and this was it. Also as allways Amazon's pricing and delivery were the best...
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Excellent movie and one which thankfully strays well out of the mainstream story of typical hollywood scripts these days. A story worth telling and participating in as a viewer
0446580848|2.0|I have enjoyed other books by this author and looked forward to this one.  The plot was very promising, and I enjoyed the book until about 3 chapters of getting to know the protagonist, John Corey.  His smart-aleck asides became too distracting and annoying and the book, for me, literally turned into a joke.  I just could not take his character anymore and gave up.  Goodbye $12.99 (Kindle).  My advice, look elsewhere.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Bought my wife a new MacBook Air so she would stop using mine.<br />Didn't notice her new Mac had a different MagSafe connector until I tried to use my charger on hers (bummer).<br />This little adapter allows us to now share chargers (not computers).
B008YRVW0I|1.0|hate when a game says its free but it is not. prepare to only get to play for a short while.
B00845MRKE|3.0|If you're looking at this, you like (or maybe even love) this film. It's absolutely fantastic, and the versions on Blu-Ray are great. As someone who has seen this multiple times, but only owned it on VHS before, I'm extremely happy with the physical product. I love the movie, and will be watching repeatedly.<br /><br />However, the big problem, and why I didn't give this package 5 stars, is the UltraViolet version. In the past, when I've bought UltraViolet movies, I was able to download it through iTunes. Which let me play it on iPad, iPhone, iEverything. Inception, Big Lebowski, all the Lord of the Rings, and others I'm forget are all in my iTunes library.<br /><br />Now, the UltraViolet copy requires some goofy, third party, that uses Adobe Air which is required to play this on your one laptop/desktop. And you have to have accounts at Flixster and UltraViolet. What's with all these hoops? I just want convenience, and this isn't it. I'm sure I can rip the movie to a local file, given all the media I have with this set (multiple BDs, and 1 DVD) but I don't want to. I just want to download and go. I want convenience.<br /><br />So, if you value the digital download, and think it's worth part of the price, you might want to find some other version without it. It's just a huge hassle.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Mr. Flynn hits it out of the park. The Mitch Rapp saga continues. I only wish there could be a new book each week.
B009ERK1T0|4.0|Coming off of what was perhaps the heaviest release of their studded, influential career (2010's \\"Diamond Eyes\\"), Sacramento-based alt/nu-metal stalwarts Deftones dive back into more melodic territory for their seventh album. But that is not to say that 2012's \\"Koi No Yokan\\" (yeah, good luck pronouncing that title!) is a sequel to 2000's watershed release, \\"White Pony,\\" because it's not. If anything, it actually sounds like a mix of all of their albums. What this means is it is rooted in sizeable, propulsive guitar chops (guitarist Steven Carpenter has clearly adopted a newfound thick guitar tone and heavy-use of distortion this time around), steady bass, and dexterous drumming, and iced with frontman Chino Moreno's accomplished clean singing. The result is a perfect balance of the Tones' two styles: Harmony and dissonance, melodic atmosphere and punishing heaviness, Coheed And Cambria-like progginess and Meshuggah-worthy headbanging.<br /><br />There is plenty of variety to be had, here, as these eleven songs range from fairly brutal and very hard-rocking numbers to straight-up balladry. Tracks like \\"Leathers\\" and \\"Goon Squad\\" (which welcomes acoustic guitars into the mix) begin with a nice, minor-key melody before slamming into full-on metallic sections. (Big, heavy, thundering guitars and vehement vocals come smashing through.) Elsewhere, cuts like \\"Tempest\\" and \\"Rosemary\\" work differently, although both retain a definite melodic and tuneful sensibility, elegantly laying excellent and highly infectious clean vocals over muscular, pounding, churning riffs and a heavy, grumbling bass bottom. (And the latter of these two songs also features a gorgeous melodic outro.) Other standouts include the stellar, dreamy singing and heavy, chugging, bottom-heavy bass riffs of \\"Romantic Dreams\\" (which also features a really memorable chorus and lyrics); the really memorable and deeply-grooving \\"Poltergeist\\"; and \\"Gauze,\\" which is backed by perhaps the album's biggest, meanest, and most brutal (and not to mention instinctively memorable) riffage. And furthering this sense of sonic diversity are tracks five and eleven, \\"Entombed\\" and the set-closing \\"What Happened To You?,\\" both of which are soaring power ballads that would be right at home on \\"White Pony.\\"<br /><br />\\"Koi No Yokan\\" fails to match the level of excellence that the Deftones achieved on \\"Diamond Eyes\\" (and, therefore, it also comes up short of \\"White Pony\\"). But it is still a good record. And it is good to see The `Tones defeating their recent trend of having to overcome much turmoil and drama (i.e. inner-strife, losing a bassist to a coma, etc.) before releasing a new album. (\\"K.N.Y.\\" was released two years after its predecessor, making it the quickest amount of time in between albums since \\"Around The Fur\\"'s release in 1997.) This album is highly recommended to all fans of any of the Deftones' albums.and most brutal (and not to mention instinctively memorable) riffage.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Wow. I loved this book and I bought it only because of a review in Entertainment Weekly. I loved all the characters and felt like I was even learning a few things along the way . This is one trilogy I'll see to the end.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|What is there to like in this book?  Why all the rave reviews for a beautiful love story?  I wouldn't want either of these characters in my life.  Bad actions, bad decisions, bad book.
B007QVLKI2|5.0|Fantastic set of songs, bought it after hearing little talks and I love the whole album! definitely worth a listen
1451696191|4.0|I thought it was great - sweet, funny, kind, poignant, sad, hopeful, real.  Should never be banned!  Hope the movie does it justice.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a great download and a wonderful book. Never had any issues.  Yes I would recommend it to anyone.
030758836X|1.0|- the literary darling of the summer.  Rave reviews.  Recommended to me by two friends.  URGH!@#$%^  I truly HATED it.  I read to escape.  If I want to hear about horrible people doing horrible things, I will watch the evening news.  If I want to read clever snarkiness, I'll go back to Jessica Darling Series - fun without the creepies.
B00448SE4S|5.0|Right up there with the 80's brat pack i would recommend this movie to anyone. I plan on purchasing the dvd.
0307744434|2.0|So much promise, such potential in a rich visual world, so did not work for me. My library e-copy expired with about 50 pages to go and I haven't bothered to buy a copy or track one down at the library to finish it. What are good books so hard to find?
B009WO7NQO|5.0|love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is the best game I have ever played I recomend it to the entire world or at least to the United States
B007IXWKUK|4.0|as in the first book of the series, always a twist and turn to keep you turning the page to find out where in the world it's going to
6305428042|5.0|It's not Halloween with our hocus pocus!! Great movie for the kids. Even if you don't have kiddos. It's an all time favorite
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is awesome.  As it goes along it becomes more challenging and fun to create crazy shapes to complete it perfectly- love it.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I love Alice in wonderland. Children's movies can't get any better than this. Every generation should watch Alice in wonderland
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I find this book hillarious! Also has historical events woven into the story. I have recommended this book to friends who I think would enjoy this level of humor.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This is a very interesting movie. Very good! Keeps you thinking and wanting to know what will happen next! I told all my friends
B006G3JPWO|5.0|Awesome movie that everyone in the family can enjoy. My family watches this movie at least 2x a year and it never gets old.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I love this movie. It has all the suspense and fear without too much visual \\"overkill\\".  Maybe you have to be a little older to appreciate it. Love the fact that it is in black and white.
B008458O3S|5.0|After reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a shot since it was faotd. It definitely is fun, challenging, and addicting. I finished it in a few days, but was hoping it would go on.
B0043JDUNS|1.0|I was so excited to watch this movie, but the quality was horrible. I couldn't even finish the movie because it would keep starting over. I didn't even get the chance to finish it. I was highly disappointed in the quality of this movie from Amazon, honestly i want my money back cause it was a waste!!
B009OYTIXS|4.0|I started watching Arrow with an open mind as with many TV incarnations of super heroes, it could have quite easily have been a complete turkey of a show.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very much pleasantly surprised to discover that this show is actually pretty awesome. Gone are the bloodless fights of Smallville and other such toned down versions of super hero stories. In their place is a TV show that produces relatively gritty fight scenes where actual lives are in jeopardy and indeed lost.<br /><br />Now, as you can probably tell by the title of this review, there are striking similarities to a certain caped crusader that dresses like a bat. The son of a billionaire goes missing for a length of time and returns as a coweled super hero, determined to clean up the mess his city has become whilst masquerading as a loser playboy. Even down to the story being set in a fictional city and having an ex girlfriend who happens to be a public prosecutor!!<br /><br />That aside, if you can prevent yourself rolling your eyes at every similar aspect this show has to Batman, you're in for a treat. So far, the stories are entertaining and progressive with the underlying storyline supplementing the weekly stories very nicely. In conclusion, a great start with hopefully more to come as the series establishes itself.<br /><br />P.S At the time I wrote this I have seen 4 episodes so please be forgiving if you read this after the season has finished and some of the points have developed...
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Fast paced, grabs you by the trouser leg and won't let go. The personalities of the characters  are so different, almost humorous at times yet it works seamlessly. Keeps you on the edge of your seat to see how each problem solves, lots of delicious twists and turns. Only problem is - keeps you wanting more.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Since page one, it trapped me, I couldn't stop reading it, finished it in 3 days!<br />It's a really fascinating book, totally recommended.

0061743526|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books.  I've loved it since I was young.  This is a very nice hardcover edition.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes nice books.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Off the wall and funny. Very entertaining story. Great acting on the kids part and what a fascinating cast. Very quirky.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was a little confusing in spots, but It was good over all. I still couldn't put it down. Had to keep reading!
B009VB9VKY|4.0|The movie was entertaining and fun. Really enjoyed watching this one. Its not intellectual but I didn't expect it to be. I enjoyed this.
030758836X|2.0|I have to start off by saying I have never been moved enough to write a book review.  This book, however, was the exception.<br /><br />I decided to get this book because of the \\"must read\\" reviews from friends.  I read the synopsis and thought it would be something I would enjoy reading.  The first part of the book, I really enjoyed.  At page 182, I figured out where this book was going, but I continued to read and still enjoyed the book.  Then we get to the end of the book.  It was as if there was a different author writing the end of this book.  The beginning of the book was so descriptive that I could actually see everything taking place in my mind, but the ending felt rushed and thrown together.  There was so much potential with this story, I just feel it was wasted.<br /><br />Many people really enjoyed this book.  You might be one of them.  I was not.  I read this book in a matter of two days and felt cheated at the end of this book.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Different stories, different voices, juicy language, hidden connections. The book has been a delight to read. The stories glide over time and place. Loved it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app. is the bomb. My best friend told me to get it and I was like ok. I'm so glad Cus I'm addicted. it's a great challenge and super fun.I highly tell u this app.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I found this to be a good book.  Not as good as Fifty Shades but a close second.  It did seem to me that I was having  déjà vu of Fifty Shades at some passages in book one but not in this one. Thank goodness.  And I found this book better than book one.
1609611543|2.0|I bought this book hoping it would help me resolve some of my stomach issues I was having.  Some of the recipes are ok.  I like the smoothies and make that often.  I read several reviews and reports on this book online.  One report was from a professor hoping the book had accurate facts but instead he found that the book was full of inaccuracies and that people on this diet actually gained weight.  I was not following this plan to lose weight but to correct some stomach issues I have been having so that was not a big deal.  What bothered me the most was I was not sure how much was true and how much was not.  Like I said, I was disappointed and do not recommend purchasing this book.
B002OR0RP0|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch with my 4 yr old.  We saw the most recent one in the theatres so it was great to go back and watch these with him.
0156027321|4.0|I had wanted to read 'Life of Pi' for sometime and never quite got around to it - but made it a goal before the movie was released. As it stands now, I'm not sure I plan to see the film adaptation.<br /><br />While it was an interesting read, be it a fable, a story, a hallucination or a coping mechanism, the idea of being at sea was not harrowing, but the brutality of having to survive was - and the author goes into detail on how Pi had to survive and it's not pretty. ...and to see that outside of my imagination on the big screen won't sit well.<br /><br />I'm not a religious person by most means, but this tale did not make me believe in g-d, as was spoken early in the intro. If anything it would have tested faith where I would have landed there was no g-d at all, or at best, a vengeful g-d.<br /><br />I have seen reviews here that have tied this book back to faith and I fail to see that in the bigger picture. That is not to say the talent of the author is poor. He's descriptive and holds your attention, but his beginning tale of faith, to me, didn't follow through to the end of the story - not really. I think it would be a stretch at best.<br /><br />For the 99 chapters, for as horrific as it was, the 100th was remarkable on certain levels, disturbing on others.<br /><br />You'd see why a 16 yo boy would cope the way he did with his grand story - and to him it was needed reality.<br /><br />'Life of Pi' is an interesting read, if not always an easy one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is better than the last two in my opinion. Only slightly because the first two are awesome, so you can't get much better.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning quite a bit. There is a lot of witty humor and comical situations. But as the book continued, it became less funny and more biographical (and not in a good way). Also, there are several unrealistic moments that frustrated me rather than made the story better.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|We got this movie free from Amazon because we pre-ordered a gift set of Marval movies, but they're not set to be released until 2013.
B005K2KCPG|3.0|I guess I expected a little more from this one.  It had some good ones, but overall I had second thoughts about buying Chickenfoot III.  I like the rawness of the first release by Chickenfoot.
030759565X|3.0|I found this book on a drill-down to the cookbook category Vegetables & Vegetarian. I was disappointed to find most recipes include plenty of butter, fats and oils -- much more than I would use daily.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|My son is a huge Harry potter fan.  I on the other hand am not.  If your over 30 this may not be for you, however if your not you may love it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Do not buy this game. I was building a house and i was on the roof i tried to jump off but i started flying and i couldnt get back down. The only way i could stop  was shuting off my kindle fire hd. Other than that it was ok. I think it should be cheeper because its not what the other 7 dollar apps are like on the appstore.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Seriously. I had heard mixed reviews about this book, but it lived up to my expectations! So glad I finally started this series and I can't wait to finish.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|There are several news reading apps - news.google.com is a raw one, Zite is another one. Flipboard has been a pioneer and is great for offline as well as online digests. I let it sync periodically and while I am in signal challenged areas, can read news as well. I could not find a way to get images in those situations, but was able read lot of articles in a east coast-west coast flight segment. Worked well in a HP Touchpad Ice Cream sandwich version as well as a Note 2 device. Can also aggregate twitter and facebook feeds.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have a background in this area, and the guy is spot on.  No othter guy could do a better first hand book on what happened.
B0086700CM|4.0|simple synopsis :run run and run.keep running from the evil monkeys get coins on the way and use your powerups to escape falling into the surrounding water.that's it. Simple?it should be.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|For the first part of the book, you believe one thing and then begin to see another story  with amazing twists come forth. Another grisham winner.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Well written, but open ended.  Felt irritated at the end of 4 \\"to be continued\\".  But enjoyed the story enough to see what happened in book 5.  Should we expect book 6?
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|This beautifully written little book has made me look at life differently. A must read for those of us who rush headlong through our days.
B0039TD7PY|3.0|The camera work is incredibly irritating. Not only is it shaky and out of focus at times, there is often someone or something in the way of many of the shots of the artists. This really ruins what must have been a wonderful concert.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and doesn't scrimp on functions.  Love the big bold view and buttons.  This calculator should be apart of the basic set of APPS on the Kindle Fire.
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|If you're a Star Trek fan, you'll love this movie. If you're a science fiction fan, this movie also applies to you. This movie isn't really for someone that's not into either of those things. I enjoyed it!
B001IF252M|5.0|This item works fine. I'm from Perú. In my country this item costs 57$. I recommend this product. Enjoy It
B000SEGUDE|1.0|This is a series of ostensibly related stories.I did not get through the entire book, as I found some of the stories to be unreadable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best ever! I use this constantly to keep track of everything from gift planning to toddler activities to recipes
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham continues to show why he is one of the best storytellers of our generation. Once you pick it up you cannot put it down. Solid story with plenty of twists and turns. I did feel that it was a bit predictable but I wanted to see how he tied it all in together. I recommend for all the Grisham fans that have read all of Grisham's books like I have.
B00902MCVY|5.0|It took eight years for this record to come out. After several listens, I'm okay with that. Jari pulled it off. Time is fantastic. About as epic as you get. Wintersun has changed their game a little, but everything amazing that served as a hallmark of the first record is there. I will say that I hope there's more shredding on the second half of the record, but the more I listen to this one, the better I like it. (verging on obsessed)
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I love this book.  I watched the show, but I was unable to watch the latest season.  I was in need of a Dexter fix so I started reading the book.  It is written so well; it really captures who Dexter is.  Also, I don't like to compare written work to shows/movies, but really the show did a good job of following the book considering so much of the book is Dexter's inner monolougue.  Simply Amazing.
B004FN7ZOC|4.0|Another solid, mind churning release for Amon Amarth. You know what to expect, and you get it in spades. Power, melody, grinding vocals, and good stories behind the songs. I think Johan is getting near Chris Barnes level of low tones on this record. Very serious death vox. Recommended.
B007L24T52|4.0|An interesting read but I guessed, more or less, who the guilty person was going to be from the outset, so that took the edge off the read for: me a little. That is not to say I didn't enjoy it, because I did but just  didn't grip me as much as other novels by this author, have
B0002UOK04|5.0|What more needs to be said about this record? Earthshattering solos, drum work to suit the Thunder God. It's beautiful, it's harsh, it's one of my all-time favorite albums. Get it. Listen to it as often as you can. You won't be sorry.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Free is free? Play another free game while you wait for coin regeneration. Better yet, don't log out, look through the prize vault and other areas, keep the app open in the background, you get 1 coin every 30 seconds, then go back and play ten or so at a time. If you take a minute and look over your next move, maybe you'll do a little better and you can stop complaining about &quot;FREE&quot; APPS. Also, while you wait that minute, you'll get 2 more coins!<br />This game is a blast.......SIMPLE!
B00992CF6W|2.0|Now don't get me wrong, I love Minecraft. The pcp version that is. This pocket edition has about the same features as a pocket. Barely any of the blocks I know, no buckets, redstone, cake, roses, you get it. Not to mention, the world is freaking small! In the pc version, you can walk for months on end without hitting the edge. But walk no more than five minutes and you'll find yourself at the edge of your pitiful little world. I wish I could give it more, but sadly, this game blows. Add more content Mojang!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I preordered this book because I so enjoyed the Harry Potter story.  This book had colourless characters, no protagonist and no plot.  I think it was supposed to be the intrigues of a village which unexpectedly has a vacancy to fiil on the village council.  The vacancy on the council was the entire story!  This book was tedious, boring and extremely disappointing.  J.K.Rowling should find another fantasy child to showcase her great talent.  This story did NOT cut it
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never read a Stephen King before.  I understand this book is very different from his others, so that makes him a great writer.  If you remember that  day, you will want to read this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 1 was great, introduced the characters and gradually showed you what happened to society. Season 2, well...it was ok. You could watch the first couple of episodes and then skipped to the last two and been just fine. Now...Season 3 is just plain awesome.  Every episode moves the story along and leaves you screaming at the end for more.  It's still early I know, but at this point with 5 episodes in it is shaping up to be the best season yet. Non-stop action, surprising twists and incredibly great acting and story telling.  If you're not really into zombie flicks that's ok, give it a try anyway because it's really more about the survivors than the actual zombies.  IMO, this is one of the best shows on TV right now. If you're just now learning about the show catch the first two seasons now on Netflix.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm glad I finally got around to reading The Hunger Games.  I will be reading the rest of the trilogy for sure!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|not a huge fan of app games and the like, but this one is well worth the time ive put into it. so addicting!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app on my kindle fire.  Its easy to use and you can set multiply locations so you can check the weather in all of them quickly &amp; easily. I use it daily and like that I don't have to get on the web to get my forecast.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book and before I knew it I finished it. Great book I would recommend it to anyone
034580404X|5.0|Exactly what i wanted. so glad to have the whole trilogy to be able to read back to back. Arrived perfect.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Version 5.0 is out in the apple stores and even though we paid the same price as them they still get it first. yoi are one shelfish company notch.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Not the best of Scarpetta, I think it's time for some new characters, Lucy can only be secretive so much, Marino a drunk and Kay and Benton can only have the same problems over and over so many times.
B0085A9J18|5.0|Look if you are looking for martial action this movie delivers I saw the clip from a friends Facebook page and was waiting til it came out late review reply but it is worth you will not be upset

B00003000M|5.0|This cd was bought as a replacement for one I had for many years. A great mix of hip-hop/rap and Bob Marley. Just love it. Arrived in perfect shape
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Too long a film considering the plot.  The storyline is rather far fetched and senseless.  It's saving grace was in some very nice visual efftects.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I loved it, I loved all the actors, everything about it!<br />I highly recommend it to all, it is wonderful
B006H5120E|4.0|The 3D aspect of this movie did not do much for the film.  I expected more dynamic visual effects which did not happen. The film is still a great show but no need to pay for the 3D upgrade.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I started reading this book, put it down many times, picked it back up, tried to like it, can't do it. Tried to return it, but it's too late. Can't get into it at all, I would not tell anyone to buy it.
B000SW2F6M|1.0|Historically illiterate, intellectually bankrupt, morally confused, absurdly plotted, abysmally acted, and virulently anti-religious (Christophobic and anti-Catholic in particular).  In addition to its pernicious agenda, the film delivers its ugly message with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  Pretentious, bloated, and full of itself (without the slightest warrant), this is among the worst movies I've ever seen -- and that's saying quite a lot.<br /><br />Anyone who likes this movie either knows nothing of history or shares the abominable Ridley Scott's philistine contempt for and loathing of it.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|The book started off well and had potential.  About half way through, it got a little stale and the last 70 pages tried too hard to shock you.  Overall, not a bad read that kept my attention throughout.
1451638450|5.0|Unlike the rest of his family, the ambition gene skipped Captain Ivan Vorpatril.  He enjoys working as an aide to General Desplain in the Barrayaran military on Komarr as that planet keeps him away from his mother Lady Alys and other imperial relatives.  Barrayaran civilian Byerly Votrrutyer visits Ivan to ask a favor of him.  She wants Ivan to take out Akuti Tejaswini Jyoti ghem Estif Arqua on a date.  By fails to inform Ivan that Tej is in hiding from a change in power on Jackson Whole in which her House Cordonah fell; her companion Rish is her bodyguard.<br /><br />However, when Ivan arrives at Tej's house, Rish welcomes him with a stun gun before tying him up.  Two men invade the apartment, but Ivan's warning enables Rish to stun them.  They flee to his home while he calls the police about the intrusion.  When Komarran immigration authorities demand he hand over the women to them, Ivan marries Tej instead and hires Rish to protect her.  His mother rejoices at the news, but his attempts to annul their marriage are disallowed while Tej's House welcomes the dupe their style.<br /><br />The latest Vorkosigan Saga science fiction (see Cryoburn) is a fabulous fresh frolic due to the comedic missteps of the hero; as mellow Ivan is the polar opposite of his heroic cousin Miles.  Lois McMaster Bujold captures Ivan's intrigue avoidance laid-back personality as the antihero just wanted a \\"Blind Date\\".<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00942S4OY|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter and did I ever make and impression.  She thinks I'm a hip grandma now and really love this band.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had read quite a few negative reviews on this final book of \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy, but I had already read the first two and was quite impressed by the story line and style of writing. Suzanne Collins did not disappoint! I was riveted and the book pulled me into a different world again, taking me through the twists and turns, all the way to the very end. I am a big fan of \\"The Hunger Games\\" movie, but the books blew me away. It's how the author described the scenes, so direct and intense!<br /><br />I just finished reading the trilogy, I give five stars for all the books! The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay...a writing job well done! Wonderfully entertaining and exciting!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game, it is a lot of fun to play. awesome game. My family enjoys playing the game to.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Great book that makes you think a lot about that time period and how much our culture has and hasn't changed.
0321701763|4.0|This is still helping me to struggle through learning Photoshop, in order to preserve all of old photos for my family. Almost like going to school at home. Still struggling.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|This movie was intense and interesting there is a guy in this movie who I couldn't quite figure out but at the end it all came together.
007174889X|5.0|I would suggest this text book as one that all Doctors must have in their library. It is a very handy addition.
B000TRSA60|5.0|This is the album that started it all for the uncomparable RadioHead. I love their sequential albums better but it is still a great one.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I don't review things on Amazon often... or at all really, but Patrick Rothfuss has done something special with these books.  I've recommended them to everyone I know, and I have yet to find someone who has read them and not been completely enamored.  I am impatiently biding my time until the next book comes out.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|Radiohead keeps impressing me with every new album and this one is tied with TKOL with my favorite albums by RadioHead.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book so much, from beginning to end.  I could not put the book down because I could not stop thinking about what would happen next.  This is a great read, but be careful, the next one doesn't come out until May...savor every minute of this one!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is an amazing site where you can leisurely browse through hundreds of pictures to select the ones that are meaningful to you.  An extremely visual experience!  You can easily find others with similar interests.  The only downside is the amount of time you'll want to spend on it -- can be addictive.
0525478817|5.0|I received this book last night and I am already at the halfway point! I would be done with it had I not gone to work today! I love reading, but I am a very picky reader. I usually start a book and finish it only to finish it. Rarely do I laugh out loud or shed a tear while reading or feel my chest pounding with excitement... this book is a breath of fresh air. I can't wait to turn the page so I am writing this review as fast as I can!
B0087EVHTE|5.0|All I can say is WOW.  This is actually a bit of a downgrade from my previous i7-970, but I rarely needed the extra cores/hyperthreading so I figured putting some cash towards the other components would be better suited.<br /><br />So far this CPU has exceeded my expectations.  Since this machine is primarily used for web surfing, gaming, and photo editing, this CPU simply runs circles around anything I throw at it.  I've yet to see it struggle, even when doing my initial burn-in testing.  Oh, and turbo boost is more like overclocking.  I've seen this CPU peg itself at 3.8GHz (max turbo speed) for as long as I have whatever stressing it running.<br /><br />One night I felt a little crazy and decided to simply bump up the turbo speeds, basically setting everything up 200MHz.  I now see it frequently hit (and remain at) 4GHz and still as stable as can be.  Temps are fine under load, I'm sure I could push it more if I felt so inclined!  Now I do have a Cooler Master Hyper 212 on here.  I wouldn't push this CPU beyond normal speeds without some kind of aftermarket cooler.  Even without overclocking, it wouldn't be a bad idea to replace that tiny cooler it comes with.  It's barely adequate for stock speeds.<br /><br />Besides being unlocked, the only feature the \\"K\\" processor has over the standard is better on-chip graphics.  For me, I went straight for the locked unit as I didn't plan on overclocking and I knew I'd be using dedicated graphics.  Of course shortly after getting the 3570, I find the 3570K is only $1 more than this processor.  It seems the gap widened again, but still annoying.  Never the less, unless you need onboard video or plan on some pretty substantial overclocking (more than simply changing the multiplier), this is plenty of power for you!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Love Love Love this movie!  Can't wait til the second in the series arrives!  I've watched it many many times!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Creepy yet enjoyable play.  Appreciated the hints.  Interesting storyline.  Puzzles were fun not tedious.  Will be buying part2 when it comes out.

1451613512|1.0|First, what I find absolutely hilarious about this is Oliver Stone's slamming \\"American Exceptionalism\\"; this, coming from a man who had reaped tremendous economic benefits from the very country and system he rails against! Only in \\"exceptional\\" America could a Liberal idiot like Stone have come up and made millions upon millions of dollars from . . . making B-grade movies that Libs get all misty-eyed over.<br />He goes, in one part, with the tired Liberal argument that the atom bomb wasn't needed and that Japan was about to surrender. Such mendacity! The Japs had already sworn that they would fight to the very last man, woman and child before giving in to the Americans. THAT, Stone, is a FACT that you Libs just don't like. The plans for invading Japan were already under way, and even after both atomic bombs were used, the plan was NOT canceled. The invasion was still to take place, until \\"The Voice of the Crane\\" finally announced of the acceptance of the terms of surrender (although the word \\"surrender\\" was never used).<br />The Cold War? I find it ironic that a hardcore Liberal Dem like Stone should slam that- it was Truman and Gen. Marshall's doing. It was called \\"Communist Containment\\", an idea Libs at that time loved! It was the Dems that brought on the Cold War, Korea and Vietnam (the Kennedy-Johnson War). It took a strong stand of no BS pulled punches from Reagan that made the Soviets realze they couldn't keep up. They were collapsing economically from the Cold War. However, THAT was NOT known during the 1950s and '60s when it was a very real threat.<br />If you want a really good history of America- DON'T buy this Liberal garbage, which just swims in radical Liberal mythology that Stone has convinced himself is the truth! This is just \\"Rolling Stone\\", \\"Mother Jones\\" and \\"The Daily Worker\\" views of American history, far from the truth. However, Oliver Stone doesn't care- he'll make millions of more dollars on our American system.

B008D30K7E|3.0|The book covers the life journey of 100 years old Allan karlsson together with some recent developments. The best description would be surreal and interesting- though I haven't found any deep meaning behind the story. Having said that- it is quite an interesting story that keeps you hooked throughout.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|what can i say i have had this knife now for two months and have worked the crap out of it cuting iron wood trees to junipers. this is one tough knife for the money just had to buy a second one love this knife. works just as good as all of my high doller knives do . such as b.o.b , bk2, bk7, bk9,andaconda,bark rivers, rat3, rat5,rat7. you just cant go wrong for the money, one awesome knife, just get your self one and you will see. awesomeness
B007PM0DLM|5.0|Stone of Tears is the second installment in the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind.  The story continues right where the previous book left off and relays the story of Richard and Kahlan in their quest for peace in the Midlands as well as their love for each other and the trials and tribulations they endure with their situation.  Old characters like Chase, Zed and Addy return and a new array of characters are introduced as well.<br /><br />If you loves the first book, Stone of Tears will also be a very enjoyable read for you.  Highly recommended.  The next book in the series would be Blood of the Fold followed by Temple of the Winds which are also amazing continuations of the saga.
B007V65R54|3.0|If you're worried that you're picking up a textbook, fear not. This is a very easy-to-read book for the layman, with little in the way of challenging equations and the like.<br /><br />More scientifically minded readers might be a bit put off with some of the oversimplifications, but Silver does provide enough context for at least 47% (with a margin of error of 3.5%;-) of his readers to understand that his seemingly clear statements can be noisy. One example is his analysis of ratings firms' assignment of risk on CDOs. He writes as if he thinks they were actually providing numbers they believed had statistical integrity. But he makes it clear that even S&P analysts were aware that their ratings \\"analysts\\" weren't doing anything that a cow with the right algorithm couldn't do.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed finding out more about the endeavors he analyzes, from baseball to poker to weather and earthquake forecasting.
B005J2V74C|2.0|At first you think this movie is really good and starts out then it gets super ridiculous as far as believability.  So much it is quite fake.  Just ok overall and honestly turned it off at the end which I never do normally.
B008476HBM|4.0|Great book for women or anyone who loves to gossip! Also contains great words and gives you a good idea of marriage and romance customs in the past.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Adobe Reader app for the Kindle is a must have. Before the app, I viewed Adobe .pdf portfolios that I have on the web via the Kindle. The images were highly pixelated on the Kindle, but showed well in the browser on both the PC and Mac. I, along with others, as I noticed on the forum, contacted Kindle Support. The Adobe Reader app became available not long after. My Adobe .pdf portfolio now shows great.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I think this game is worth the price if you're a Star Wars fan who doesn't mind Angry Birds. I didn't give it 5 stars because my expectations weren't met in terms of the length of the game. I just hope that the add-on isn't too far off.

B004UNX1LS|2.0|This app has increasingly gotten worse. I remember when I first got it a few months ago and it worked perfectly. Now, the quality is very poor and it takes forever to load. A few times I have to shut my Kindle down and back on again to get it to work. Still, it plays popular videos and it's the official licensed VEVO. I've found other VEVO apps that didn't compare to this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|During Sandy with flickering lights & conserving other electronic usage, this app kept us connected to weater info near & elsewhere with frequent updates & what to expect in following days. Favorite is what it actually feels like outside. Automatic weather alerts & temp on toolbar are also a plus:-)
B007DIQC90|5.0|\\"My Head Is An Animal\\" by Of Monsters And Men contain songs that are an amalgam of folk rock and indie rock. \\"King And Lion Heart\\",\\"Mountain Sound\\", \\"Numb Bears\\", \\"Yellow Light\\", \\"From Finner\\", \\"Of Monsters And Men\\", and \\"Lakehouse\\" were some of the songs that I really enjoyed.  \\"My Head Is An Animal\\" by Of Monsters And Men is best for those who like music hybrids of alternative and indie rock.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a very nice, basic photo editor. I wasn't expecting Photoshop, but I was impressed with the different filters and the degree of control I had with the app. Excellent.<br /><br />My one complaint is that it can take a little while to load. But, uhm, three seconds in instant gratification world isn't bad which is why I gave it five stars instead of four.

B008YZXYY2|4.0|I love that bands change their style, makes for a surprise and is not repetitive.  Stone sour changes on virtually every album and they sound awesome.  i am currently now Listening to \\"Audio Secrecy\\" but just got done listening to this album.  At first I didn't care for some of it but after paying more attention to it, I actually really enjoyed it, except the two acoustic songs but that's just personal preference.  They really structured album in a brilliant manner.  Corey Taylor has really matured as a vocalist and I am enjoying him more and more.  Very good album and should be in your collection!!
B005LAII3U|4.0|I'm a huge Phillip K. Dick fan, and the Recall/Rekall movies, although very loosely based on \\"We can remember it for you wholesale\\" are still a welcome addition to the numerous movies based on this highly original thinker's writings.<br /><br />If you're a can of the original Arnold movie (the last big budget film to use practical effects - no CGI), you'll spot many homages to it in this movie. That adds to the cool factor.  We have miss triple C. When Quaid passes through security, the lady in front of him is almost a twin to Arnold's disguise. The arm being chopped off in the elevator. Miss three boob. There's more, but I want to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />There are a LOT of continuity errors (watch the elevator chase scene carefully). One of the worst is the final scene on the drop ship.  How did their hardware (helicopters, etc.) change sides?!? Or not get totaled (clamps like the Green Hornet car used?) Also, lost of \\"duh\\" moments. Why would the \\"colony\\" evacuate to \\"nozone shelters\\" - the entire premise is that the nozone is uninhabitable and they don't have protection. If this society has antigravity and more highly advanced technology, why not expand the cities and clean up the polluted areas? How is it that the city is right next to and surrounded by a toxic environment - but the environment stays out? No dome. No technology. It just stays out. Drill THROUGH the earth? Because it's the \\"only way\\" to travel?!?<br /><br />OK, so let's ignore all that. It's an entertaining movie with fantastic special effects and original fight scenes. Plenty of chases, a close-quarters cat-fight, running gun battles, maglev car chase - you name it.  The first 20 minutes or so leading up to the Rekall visit are \\"eh\\" - pretty boring. After that, it's a rapid build up to almost non-stop action. This is a movie I'll definitely buy on BluRay - just to frame through the cityscape during the car chase. The amount of thought that went into urban design with access to anti-gravity is mind-blowing. The DETAILS throughout the movie - wow. Watch it once. Then watch it again with your finger on the pause button. Easter eggs galore. Lots of cool tech (including the touch-screen faced fridge.)<br /><br />It's not Arnold's Total Recall. In many way's it's better - it's decades later, so SFX have improved exponentially. In many ways it does not measure up. You'll have to decide for yourself.<br /><br />But if you want an entertaining, fast-paced SciFi romp with a TON of eye candy (from the aforementioned triples to the city), plenty of fight scenes and gun battles, then don't miss this movie.mind-blowing.

B007ONSLLQ|2.0|The first few songs were good, but then they got boring and too lame.  You can tell they are reaching for mainstream success, which is good but they are going to sell out fast.  This is one of those bands who appeals to the mainstream, I am guessing they are going to go melodic and a little alternative contemporary for the next album.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle (and team) created another hit. Very nice album. I felt entranced. Her voice is magical. I hope she does many more albums from the stage and movies.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King is masterful storyteller.  He sucks you into his world and you forget about the one you are living in.  This one is one of those stories.  I gave it 4.5 instead of a 5.0 because of the ending.  It was a good ending, but not great.
141659521X|2.0|I used to be a huge fan of Vince Flynn/Mitch Rapp.  But I must say that lately, starting with Kill Shot and continuing with The Last Man, the quality, excitement, complexity of plot, female interplay, etc., etc., basically everything that made the Mitch Rapp books awesome, has diminished and is on a downward spiral.<br /><br />Has Vince run his course?  Will we ever get another great Mitch Rapp book?<br /><br />Who knows.  But to me this is second strike.  Another strike and I will no longer be a fan.<br /><br />Then I will just perform periodic Electro-Convulsion therapy (like in Homeland), and then read the old Mitch Rapp books over and over again.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Wes Anderson certainly uses the cinematographic medium to its full advantage in this wonderfully creative film about adolescent love. Even though the story is your basic 'boy meets girl', Anderson's attention to detail and nuance balanced with deadpan humor and sight gags make this movie a delight to watch. Unpredictable at times, formulaic at others, it is a visual and auditory treat. The underpinning of the entire film is Benjamin Britten's \\"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\\" (a brilliant choice!) Even though the story takes place in 1965, don't expect any traditional 'Top 40 Hits' of that era -  Anderson is much too eclectic for that. This isn't necessarily a profound cinematic experience - but it is an entertaining, eccentric, funny, touching, and a visually and musically arresting one. (Rated PG-13 for 'sexuality and smoking'??? Come on, they were only kissing, and the girl was in her undergarments. But the PG-13 rating shows just how ridiculously prudish America and the MPAA have become.)

B001O22ELQ|4.0|Plot<br />While trying to take over the world, Dr Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris) finds out that not everything goes according to plain. He believes that if he can find a way to fulfill his dreams of gaining access to the Evil League of Evil and finding a way to win the attention of his secret crush, Penny (Felicia Day), that maybe people will take him more serious as a Super Villain. However, his nemesis, Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion) keeps spoiling his brilliant ideas and making him foolish.<br />Throughout the whole film, Dr. Horrible uses his Internet blog as a way to boast about his super brilliant evil ideas. When reading mail sent in by his viewers, he is asked about whom he is referring to when he says \\"she\\". This causes the story to switch back and forth between action adventures and a computer set-up, which appears to be in Dr. Horrible's garage, along with his numerous collections of villainous guns and inventions.<br />During these action adventures and Internet blogs, Dr Horrible and Captain Hammer, compete for Penny's affections. As we watch more of the film we begin to see the differences between the two and their attempts to win over Penny. Doctor Horrible appears to be more of a nice guy than an evil one, while Captain Hammer comes off as conceded and arrogant, making him a poor excuse of a hero. As the film comes to an end, the two face off in a duel for power and the affection of Penny,  which ends badly for one of the two.<br /><br />Reaction<br /><br />As I sat in class, watching Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Blog, I couldn't help but enjoy myself. While I didn't really find myself rolling on the floor laughing, I found the whole thing fun and entertaining to watch.<br />I thought Neil Patrick Harris' singing was outstanding, as well as that of all of the actors in the movie. Each person played his or her role perfectly; with Neil Patrick Harris playing the love stricken Villain, Nathan Fillion playing the conceded, poor excuse for a Super hero,and Felicia Day playing the secret lover fought over by both characters.<br />The film does have some sexual references as well as mild swearing, however, it is a great watch for the whole family. I believe that after watching the film, it should be given a rating of four and a half stars out of five.
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|Looking at this product it is very clear that Voodoo Tactical has quality a standard. I have a shotgun scabbard made by Voodoo and that holds just as high of quality. I am bigger than normal guy and this rig has ample room for a guy my size. The pouches are sewn but for my intended application this makes a perfect chest rig, the pouches are at a perfect placement for magazine extraction but if you are looking for a plate carrier than you might want to look elsewhere. This is a great rig I recommend it to anyone looking for a good rig for running drills.
B0025KW29U|4.0|The movie Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a 42 minute film directed by Joss Whedon and starring Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day. The movie represents the battle of good and evil. However, in this case it is not the expected hero Captain Hammer (Nathan Fillion) who is the good guy but the unexpected Dr. Horrible (Neil Patrick Harris). In the beginning of the short film the \\"evil\\" Dr. Horrible is wearing white, representative of purity or innocence. While Captain Hammer wears black, which typically represents darkness or evil.  As the movie progresses Dr. Horrible demonstrates several times that he is not horrible. He states in response to a letter about meeting in a park to fight, \\"There are children there. And elderly.\\" Also, he shows he has love for a beautiful gentle woman Penny, played by Felicia Day.   Captain Hammer demonstrates that he is not the \\"good guy\\" in several ways also. When Captain Hammer first appears on screen he is saving the day by destroying the controls Dr. Horrible has on a van. But quickly you realize that Captain Hammer is not concerned that this van is driving by itself on the street but more with a pretty lady. Then takes the credit as the \\"Hero\\" for saving Penny even though it was Dr. Horrible. On his date with Penny at the homeless shelter he appears disgusted with his surroundings.  Again in the park he is appalled that the animals are near him. And lastly, he talks to Dr. Horrible in the laundry mat that he is going to sleep with Penny for the only reason that Dr. Horrible wants her and says, \\"Because I get what you want.\\"   In the end Dr. Horrible is to kill Captain Hammer with a death ray. His plans are foiled again and Penny ends up dying. However, Dr. Horrible now achieves his goal of being evil enough for the League of Evil, this is a shallow victory. At the loss of his love he becomes truly evil. Dr. Horrible's clothes have gone from white to red, which represents anger, temper or hightened emotions. He appears sad and angry in the end.   The cinematography was excellent in this film. I actively looked for the camera man in the reflection of the dryers opening in a scene in the laundry mat and was unable to see them.  My wife, a huge Buffy and Angel fan, watched the video at my request and at the end when she saw the credits, said  she could tell it was a Joss Whedon production and even thought one of the songs sounded similar to a song on the musical episode of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I would recommend this funny, corny video with excellent acting and singing to any Buffy fan or anyone who wants a quick laugh.    Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog Ad (Video).  (2008).

B000SEGMAU|5.0|I love all the Mitch Albom books but this one has a special place. I first read Tuesdays with Morrie in 1997, Since then, I have reread it several times and suggested it to a number of people.<br /><br />While the story itself is a tear-jerker, there is so much to learn from it. I look at life and death very differently now. Two of the things that Morrie had said to Mitch was that until you learn how to die, you can not truly live. Also, that everyone is dying from the day they are born.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was swept away more by the power of love and the intensity if their relationship more than the sex which can be found in any raunchy novel. The end of the trilogy left me wanting more. I'd love to see a book that takes them further into their sexy but beautiful life together.

B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Forget about Rihanna, One Direction, Pitbull, Taylor Swift, Twilight new albums. \\"Lotus\\" is the real deal.<br /><br />Christina Aguilera is BACK! After the disappointment of [[ASIN:B003G4DFRC BIONIC - DELUXE (Explicit)]] even tough there were some good songs on the album. \\"Lotus\\" has a mixture of different genres which is great and hopefully everyone can enjoy this new album from Christina. It has Pop, Dance, Ballad, Techno, Eurodance and even a country-ish track.<br /><br />1. Lotus Intro - Great intro to the album. It feels like your being welcome to a new chapter of Xtina and the \\"Lotus\\" era. [8/10]<br /><br />2. Army of Me - A great pop ballad. I can see why Xtina is calling it Fighter 2.0 [9.5/10]<br /><br />3. Red Hot Kinda Love - The 1st few seconds the beat gets you hooked. You will be replaying this over and over again because it will get into your head. [9.5/10]<br /><br />4. Make the World Move (Feat. Ceelo Green) - This collaboration is PERFECT! Needs to be a single with a crazy music video. It's fun and catchy.  [10/10]<br /><br />5. Your Body - Great song but it should have been the 2nd single. The 1st time I heard it I liked the track. [9.5/10]<br /><br />6. Let There Be Love - Should have been the 1st single and hopefully the next single from the album. This will BLOW UP the charts worldwide. It's super catchy and will be in your head for days. Sounds like a RedOne Production but actually the popular Max Martin produced it. [10/10]<br /><br />7. Sing for Me - A ballad song. Xtina vocals are really great.<br /><br />8. Blank Page - Another ballad. Vocals also great.<br /><br />9. Cease Fire - When I heard it I didn't really like it but it grew on. Good song. [8.5/10]<br /><br />10. Around the World - Where do I start on this track. Amazing! [10/10]<br /><br />11. Circles - Grea beat and music production. [10/10]<br /><br />12. Best of Me - Another ballad song. I never been a fan of ballad songs but this is actually good. [10/10]<br /><br />13. Just aFool (Feat. Blake Shelton) - Didn't like it when I 1st listen to it but it grew after a few listen. Pop, Country, and Ballad mixed together. Interesting collaboration. [8.5/10]<br /><br />14. Light Up the Sky - Great Pop ballad song. This coming from a person who dosen't like ballads. [10/10]<br /><br />15. Empty Words - Good song. [8/10]<br /><br />16. Shut Up - At 1st I was what the heck is this song but overall it's alright and it's growing on me. [8/10]<br /><br />17. Your Body [Martin Garrix Remix] - Great remix.<br /><br />Overall I give this album a 9.5/10 and I recommended it. One of the best Pop album.<br /><br />For people who are confused about the explicit version:<br />\\"Circles\\" is the only explicit song on the entire album. For some unknown reason \\"Your Body\\" (Explicit Version) did not make into the final album and it's not officially available to purchase. For the song 'Shut Up' the lyric, \\"Shut up just shut the BEEP\\" was meant to be that way but it would have been good to include the real word instead. The label, RCA messed up on the explicit release. The clean version of \\"Lotus\\" everything is the same as the explicit version except \\"Circles\\" which is censor.

1936608618|5.0|Power Speed Endurance A Skill-Based Approach to Endurance Training is one of those books you pre-order and then count down the days till it arrives at your door.  I was able to get my hands on an advanced copy of the pre-order and I am extremely satisfied.  I have been following the methodologies of CrossFit Endurance for awhile and I have a CrossFit Endurance Certification.  That being said I felt like I had already been well versed in what Brian would presumably share in his text.  I was wrong. This book goes so much farther down the rabbit hole that I can wholeheartedly say that this is what the next level looks like.  If you are an athlete or a coach, like myself, and you are training endurance athletes you had better put this on your \\"read immediately cover to cover and start reworking how I do things\\" list... at the very top.  The taste of what can be done with flipping the long duration model on its head have been reflected in things like Brian's work with Timothy Ferris in The 4-Hour Body, but they didnt scratch the surface of the immense resource that Brian and his work are for not just endurance athletes but every athlete.  You are not just fed all the information you ever wanted for techniques, drills, progressions, programming, and the science behind it all.  You are also given a well documented pictorial guide to perfect the relationship between the raw data and your personal application.  I truly expect that the athletes and coaches who have not been paying attention to the movements of Brian through IAMUNSCARED.COM and CrossFit Endurance will be seconding guessing why they had not paid attention sooner.  Cover to cover this book is every bit of what it was promised to be, a true bible and testament to the new and improved world of athletic performance and endurance.  If you are second guessing what you are getting you are wasting precious time to be better from core to extremity, from top to bottom, and from biological to neurologically a more sound,fit, healthy, and uninjured version of your former athletic self.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A riveting story that grabs you from beginning to end. You don't know what is going on until the very end of the book. It is great storytelling,worth every dime.
0385340990|5.0|This book was so good but the big disappointment came: it ended! I was completely transported back in time and felt I was actually there on the island with these strong, courageous characters due to the style of writing that just sucks you in; you'll find time just flies by as you get drawn in to this story. What a tragedy Mary Ann Shaffer then died before being able to write more: what a fantastic writer this duo was! I thought it was a fairly quick read because of not being able to put it down. This book left me wanting to learn more about this period of time in our history and the stories of people that were also survivors like these characters. Truly worth reading...even more than once!

B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie Goulding's second album is brilliant. Rather than the lyrics alone conveying the emotionality of the album, this time the music itself joins in. This makes the album surprisingly more powerful. Her first album, Lights, is one of my favorites, and this one may have topped it.
6302136105|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatre ages ago...and fell so deeply into it that it was hard to get back to \\"reality\\" once the lights came up.  To truly watch this movie, you need to put on the DVD, turn off all of the lights, and crank the sound.  It will trance you out...which is part of the point, I believe.<br /><br />This isn't so much a movie about Jim Morrison and the Doors as it is about shamanism, about the dangers of \\"breaking on through to the other side.\\"  Yes, the director played fast and loose with some of the facts, but that wasn't his goal--this movie is clearly about Jim Morrison as Dionysus, about his obsession with love and death and seeking to open the doors of perception.  He remade himself as a shaman/poet, as having the soul of an Indian medicine man, and used drink and drugs to alter his consciousness.  The problem is (as with many) eventually this took its toll and he drank and used drugs to escape from reality, rather than to expand his awareness of true reality.  This movie shows both aspects of being a shaman and a poet.<br /><br />You really need to watch this movie through the eyes of understanding the metaphor and symbology it uses.  Death pursues Jim throughout the movie...in one scene, he dances both on the stage and around the fire with the audience.  He dances with other medicine men.  And then that is taken away from him because it was time for him to be torn apart by his \\"followers\\"...only they don't oblige.  They just don't get it.  If he was Dionysus, then they were supposed to consume him.<br /><br />One of the best bits in the movie takes place at the Whiskey, when even the go-go dancers stop and listen entranced to what he is telling them...when he sings about the ancient \\"snake,\\" the snake that Morrison asks us to \\"kiss,\\" the snake of whom we are all a part of.  I can understand why the audience was portrayed as becoming tranced out during that scene, because the song \\"The End,\\" does entrance you, both in the context of the movieand when you listen to it on a CD.<br /><br />The movie, The Doors, is a poem, a song, a myth.  Don't watch it expecting facts about the band...watch it and let it carry you to the desert, to the snake seven miles long, and allow it to open the doors of perception to the other side.

The ingredients alone are fresh and the recipes fantastic! I have made at least ten of them but I am also afraid to get the book dirty! It is a true work of art and all my friends are getting a copy this Christmas! I can't wait for the next one! Well done to Katie Quinn Davies
B00006JSS8|5.0|If you love Stevie's wonderful music, then this is one CD you must have.  Believe it or not, this is a replacement for some of his big hits he did years ago which I had bought on 8 Track.  Had not listened to them in years and in an &#34;a-ha&#34; moment decided I needed to hear them again.<br />They sound great, Amazon had a good price, and Stevie and I were doing our thing again within about two days of placing the order.  Thanks Mr. Wonder and Amazon.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|Este blu-ray não pode faltar pára apreciadores de boa músicas, este disco é fantastico com grandes cantores interpretando lindas canções
0307341577|4.0|This book surprised me. I like to read dark mysteries and this definitely was that. The author has a talent for writing in such a suspenseful way that it could be an addicting television show where each chapter, like an episode, leaves you on a cliffhanger. It's told from alternating viewpoints which ramps up the suspense even more. It's unpredictable and gruesome so if you like that sort of mystery then you will be hooked.

B000AYQJ3I|4.0|Unable to give honest review as this was purchased as a Christmas gift. I saw the original movie in the theater when first released. I loved it then and am sure since George Harrison is my grandson's favorite Beatle, he will enjoy it too.
B001R60ESE|4.0|um grande músico com um time artistas para acompanhar que proporciona bastante variedade, blu-ray chegou em perfeito estado, recomendável para iniciantes em música
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I no nothing about the video games but saw this on Youtube. The story was great, the acting was great, and the action was great. I had only 2 issues. The short pieces before each part ( 5 parts) were anoying. The second issue was that it was too short! I would have loved more character development. Master Chief was a power! There were a couple of weak dialogues, though (\\"Stay close to me. It's your only chance for survival\\" - where else are they going to go? )Otherwise I would expect that every Halo fan, and all others will really enjoy this.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so much fun. I can't believe all the games on this app. The app shows you lots of games that aren't anywhere else.
B009WJ2XT6|4.0|This film score makes perfect sense after seeing Skyfall.<br /><br />I believe the movie is contemporary and classic so the score follows the mood of the film.  During a classic Bond sequence featuring the DB5, the score responds with a classic John Barry style.  However for much of the film, there are tips to the cap to the past or moments when Bond displays the trademark traits we are familiar with.  In these cases the music follouws suit by hinting at the James Bond theme or containing trace elements of that theme.<br /><br />Yes, the Adele tune is not included but that can be picked up for less than $1.50 and there is plenty of music on this soundtrack to justify the price.<br /><br />As an owner of all of the offical Bond soundtracks I enjoy this musical journey of Bond coming of age in Skyfall.

B009P13RQY|5.0|I don't care what anybody says. This is probably my favorite album of the bunch.  Plus a few cool live tracks and a sweet cover to boot.
B009FREK3W|1.0|I will admit I didn't listen to all the songs, as Evil Woman was my all-time favorite, so I did go there first. I only heard a few bars of it, then bailed.  I saw them in concert in 75-1976 when they were at their early peak and saw them do Evil Woman live.  So I do really know their music.  I have always considered the original recording of Evil Woman to be about as perfect a song as there could be.  But the remake?  Trash - so thin - and the Clavinet which was one of the hallmarks of the song - TERRIBLE TIN CAN!  No lushness of real strings either!  I know Lynne is a perfectionist, but sometimes you can carry things too far and cannot see the forest for the tress.  I have never heard a remake EVER of any old classic songs that was any good.  Live versions can be pulled off because you are not trying to make it perfectly match the original.  Best example is when Chubby Checker re-recorded all his hits when CD's first came out - to get a better $$cut from the songs since he either didn't get anything or not much from the originals.  They also were terrible and could not be marketed.  You can's just delete someone like Dee Dee Sharp and expect people won't notice she's not there in those old songs.  Eventually, after a LONG time, the originals were released and the re-recorded versions just faded away...Listen for yourself to these re-recorded songs an you be the judge.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Very nice purple kindle fire HD cover. It has the elastic band around it to keep it closed. It also has the nice stand up case which is nice when reading in bed. Also came in 2 days!!:)

B009VB97EY|3.0|Magic Mike has lots of hotness! The story is weak but lets be honest, thats not why we watched it! It wasnt worth $3.99.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Been playing Bingo Blitz on Facebook for a LONG time.  Just bought a Kindle Fire and I thought I'd pop this sucker on it.  Looks beautiful and I haven't encountered any gameplay or bug issues.  Not all the Facebook features are on Kindle yet (kind of a bummer), but they're being released soon and, honestly, the gameplay is what it's about on BB, so I really can't complain.
B0091REZMW|3.0|it was ok... I think it should have the ability to start a new game or start over. other than that I enjoyed. it.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|I'll get in on the reviews.<br /><br />I've been listening to this album 3 days straight, I like it. It's not as brilliant as Superunknown, and if that's what you were expecting (Spoonman, My Wave, Fell on Black Days), then I'd say pass on buying the album and listen to Nickelback. There doesn't seem to be big catchy hooks (the Seattle bands were never about catchy hooks anyway), but every song sounds good (which is what the Seattle bands are known for). Most albums from Seattle are buy it if you want, if not, it's ok.<br /><br />So far, the stand out songs for me are Been Away Too Long, Non-State Actors, Taree, Attrition, Worse Dreams, and Rowing. So far, the only song I'm not really into yet is Blood on the Valley Floor. I say \\"so far\\" and \\"yet\\", because I think it takes 2 weeks before you finally \\"get\\" an album.<br /><br />I'll give the album a 4, just because Superunknown is a 5, and Superunknown is a classic. Personally I don't think another Soundgarden album is as good as Superunknown, but Badmotorfinger is close at a 4.5.
1612680011|4.0|It is the book that changed my life. Some people hate him and call him tricker, but I recomment you to read this first before judge him and his book. This book contains many simple, but important concept to be a rich guy.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this puzzle game. its got lot of great options not just size but you can if u want to rotate the pieces
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Engaging, interesting... a must read for dog lovers.  This book draws you in and keeps you until the last page.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|You definitely enter the world of this young girl, and feel what she feels and understand her point of view.  Not an easy task since she's had a difficult life and is a difficult person.  I was a foster care social worker, so the heroine's wrestling with the  system seems painfully accurate.  As tough as all this was to read, the information about the flowers, the history of their message and the life of a florist and  winemaker , and the long winding road to trust and be trusted was amazing.
B000O1799U|5.0|The movie is wonderful. The actors portrayed the characters well. I saw the play four times. The movie had me from the beginning to the end.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Good book.  I can't wait to see where he will go with the next book. This book had more character development similar to the last book.  You definitely cannot get attached to any one character, that's the kiss of death.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I was wainting for much more. Nothing special about this book and at some point I found myself really bored.
B001RT89UG|5.0|Listening to this I found that the songs that were from the original 9 song version were different from the original. Some were longer with subtle differences in the guitar and vocals. Definitely NOT complaining, this version doesn't replace the original as much as it is a companion version. I just hope that they eventually release the original video of this concert on DVD. Worth getting even if you own the original. A highlight of the MSG catalog, just like Unleashed In the East (10 out of 10) was for Judas Priest. Enjoy!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This product is worth a try if you are looking for a good You Tube video connection...I like it for the great picture that fills the screen with the best you tube video I have seen ... You have the option of downloaded the.

I prefer this to mini windows for ease in selecting what you want to view..I display video on a Big Lots sale tablet that has 1080x800 resolution and a 9 inch screen. running Android ICS 4...(cost  $129.00 ).  I give the product 5stars because I can't find anything I would change or even grumble about..

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyable book.  Kept your attention throughout the entire book.  Hard to put down.  Purchased the Kindle version and as always was happy to receive the book immediately.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Very entertaining and an in-depth look at the vast divide between the titled aristocracy and what was considered the serfs. You see the change that is ultimately coming as the world changes because of WWI and the demands of the many ordinary soldiers who fought it as well as the incompetence of the titled Officer Corps. I could not put it down and as soon as I finished it, I got the second book in the series and am currently reading it. When I'm finished with the 2nd book, I can't wait for the third book in the trilogy to come out.
0761171703|5.0|Dancers Among Us was a wonderful journey of how beautiful the everyday activities of our lives can be portrayed in a way that brings joy to such simple things. The imagination of the photographer and the beauty, grace and power of the dancers was so unique. We have a copy on our coffee table and everyone loves it. I hope that Jordan Matter continues in his quest to see beauty in the simple things of life. Thanks!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel. I wasn't sure what to expect and can't quite remember why I chose to download it on to my kindle - apart from the intriguing title. I do like novels that have quirky characters: Jamie, Lydia and the other characters in this novel certainly fit this description. Christine McKenna writes in a way that allows the reader to get to know each character and to empathise with each one's situation, both in the past and the present. My heart ached for the ten-year old Jamie. I found myself hoping so  much for a \\"happy ending\\" and was well-pleased with the novel's conclusion.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|love this movie laughs all over the movie .Love when the original Barnabas comes to the party. Just sad it was  his last role ! uncanny isn't it???????
B0033806MI|3.0|I think the hole Percy Jackson series is great I was so exited about finding out about what happened in the end!!!  : )  I think its the best book ever what would we do without Rick Riordan!!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Beautiful set. If you are a fan of the series you will love and appreciate this. The extras include gag reals and deleted scenes. Makes a great gift.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I've won some serious COIN in Vegas on a game like this. This game however DOES need to be faster, more coins provided WITHOUT having to buy them!!!!!! Otherwise so-so, if you were playing it while waiting for someone that's in Surgery , you'll likely end up in the mental ward!!!!!
1250004217|4.0|Tatiana de Rosnay's story, Sarah's Key, tells about the adventures and emotions of reporter Julia Jarmond during her adventure to learn about the mysterious Vel d'Hiv incident that occurred in Paris...all while experiencing the tale of one of the children involved in the incident. With de Rosnay's skillful switching between the two women's tales, the reader learns about the struggle to learn about one of history's darkest hours while experiencing the darkest hour in its fruition.<br /><br />Overall, the book was one that held my attention from page 1 till the end and beyond. The excellent use of rhetorical devices and emotion grabs your attention in a way many modern books fail to accomplish. The most beautiful part of the book, however, is the historical knowledge brought to the light with the tale in the book; I know personally I knew nothing of the event before the book, and the book encouraged me to do my own research, which coming from a book is amazing. I recommend this book for everyone to read.
0446580848|5.0|I always eagerly anticipate the next John Corey novel from Nelson DeMille.  I laughed out loud in several spots, as is typical whenever Mr. Corey starts cracking wise.  There was a little less action in this book than usual, and a lot of moving from place to place and strategizing.  But it was very informative, and the setting was made vivid by the author's descriptive abilities.  I can only imagine the research that had to be accomplished to write this book.  Brilliant!
B00913DPW2|5.0|There are a lot of \\"point and click\\" games out of there or puzzle games but most turn out to be hidden object games.  The Haunt has puzzles in it that are not hidden object.  The game is very fun and I can't wait to play more like it.

B007SGM084|4.0|I had been told that the writing was not seasoned, but of course I had to read the trilogy since everyone was talking about it. I'm glad I read it and I would recommend it but I wouldn't read it again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've read the whole sieres and this has to be one of the funniest books ever, I HIGHLY recommend this for people 6 years old and over. I loved this book. Jeff Kinney (the author of diary of a wimpy kid) is a we some guy. you should read this book
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|Everything was wonderful. It came to my house very quickly too, I was very impressed and surprised. I was very happy
0312641893|5.0|Having never before read Marissa Meyer, I allowed myself to be drawn in more by the beautiful cover art than the promise of 'best teen book for 2012'. I figured critics weren't all that reliable. Turns out they were absolutely right. Cinder was the steamiest-punkiest steam punk novel I have encountered in quite some time. It's so encouraging to see inventive use of a classic tale without a single vampire. The clever weaving of the age old story into an alternate post WW4 world was masterful and seemingly effortless. Of course she wore grease stains instead of ash smudges, lost a foot instead of a shoe, and so on. I also couldn't help but feel a parallel to the story of Anastasia the Russian princess from our history books. Princess Selene is the missing princess once-dead and now resurrected that no one can resist, including the prince. Kudos to this new non-vamp Meyer for creating such a convincing world of mechanical wonder. Oh, and thanks for putting an orange VW Beetle in there. Priceless!
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|watch Breaking Bad instead ... a joke painful to watch. Actors going thru the motions with a terrible script ,used up plot,every involved looking for a paycheck instead of a great movie
B009NQKPUW|4.0|A good prequil that will most definitly lead to the ever popular post-pre prequil. Beautiful to watch and a not so predictable plot line. I would suggest purchasing this especially if you are a fan of the Alien series. There will surely be more to come.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It got better the farther into the book I got.  I don't know that I'd recommend the trilogoy.  I started to know what alll the hype was about and then kept going although in the second, I questioned continuing.  If it were condensed into one book, I'd say it was good. It was a bit tiresome at times.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod continues in his romantic mode, singing Christmas songs that are mostly traditional.  Soothingly sung, sometimes with a duet partner.  His raspy voice holds the tune, and we especially like \\"AULD LANG SEIN\\". If you enjoy his style, you will enjoy this CD.

B008G33OJM|5.0|A magnificent concert album from former Nightwish vocalist Tarja Turunen, her first concert tour with her new prog/symph/metal band.  While almost every reviewer reports the Blu-Ray being defective (won't play beyond the titles) I must have lucked out as my region-free Blu-Ray plays fine on my Panasonic BD655 - a spectacular operatic metal concert from one of the best vocalists singing progressive metal.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This movie was so great!! The animation and colors were amazing! My niece and her friends were in awe the entire time!! Loved it!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|&#34;Persuasion&#34; is a wonderful book and this is a fantastic movie version of the book.  I had a VHS version of this for years and finally picked up the DVD.<br /><br />The cast is spot on - without &#34;big&#34; names to which the script is molded around.  It is very true to the book - and evokes in the viewer a lingering wistfulness of what might have been.<br /><br />My recommendation is to read the book first and then see the movie to see the characters brought to life.  If you are not a reader, you will still enjoy the beautiful story of a love that survives despite all odds against it.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Good movie. Good quality. A lot better than I first thought. However, there were issues with the streaming service. It would freeze at points, but they would rectify themselves fairly quickly.
B00003CXMG|5.0|No blood and guts, no action, In the spirit of Mr. Hollands Opus,This is truly a good movie, It may not be considered great, but It compells me to submit a review to give credit where credit is due, 5 stars, it made me feel. B.Payne
B006TVQU6C|4.0|I liked it's style. The bottom mounted psu slot and ample room make it easy to work with. Plenty of ventilation with it's two 120mm fans already installed. Great buy.

B0041KVZ1I|2.0|[Review of the 2012 remastered vinyl pressing of Abbey Road]<br />Like a lot of other Beatles fans, I was excited for the new 2012 remastered vinyls coming out (the wait for the mono box set especially). The first album that I was going to get (and did get) was Abbey Road. The album came in looking shiny and nice, although the album sleeve was bent on the top. The vinyl itself was really nice and it's just fantastic to finally hold a 180 gram Beatles album. Despite the fact that digital copies were used, all that mattered was the sound, right?<br /><br />And then I played it.<br /><br />Upon listening to the first raw, bombastic sounds of \\"Come Together\\", I knew something was wrong. Very wrong. As the first side kept playing and got to heavier tracks, the sound kept that raw and unadulterated sound to it. Clearly, this didn't sound like Abbey Road at all. When I decided to give up on the first side and give a listen to the second, I was awe-struck. Analog-sourced or not, the album sounded pretty good. Although it doesn't meet to the standards of the original 1969 pressing, this is a very acceptable pressing for those who are new to vinyl or just want a cheap market-value issue.<br /><br />So what the heck's up with the first side?<br /><br />According to some users on various websites, they have been experiencing the same problem, with most theorizing it as a possible pressing issue. If this is the case, then these albums should be recalled and rereleased as soon as possible. This is a great sounding album (though hard to compare to clean originals, but give or take). When such a classic album has half of it ruined by a pressing issue, I believe it deserves much better treatment than what we got.
B008VVT51U|4.0|Loved it!!It was easy to download and watch.  I really enjoyed the movie and would buy one this way again.
B005IS565S|2.0|Damn it! I was going to give this album 3 stars until I read the review which compares the singing to Nickleback. That's exactly what the chorus of \\"The Pride\\" sounds like.<br /><br />The lyrics are really bad.  More emo than angry. Also this is not metal or screaming, he speaks/growls lines that sound more like rap on a sore throat than screaming.<br /><br />The one outstanding aspect of this CD (and why I bothered to write a review) is that the rifts are awesome.  You can't stop from dancing to the music.  What some reviewers have labeled \\"over produced\\" I actually appreciate because you can finally hear how talented they are as musicians. (I did not like the past two CDs because the instruments sounded like they were being played in another room)<br /><br />Not very good overall, If you are looking for metal try \\"All that remains\\" new album and if you are looking for quality rock with deep lyrics try \\"10 years\\".
0785163174|4.0|I have to shake my head in wonder at some of the scathing reviews for this series.  Personally I loved the series and haven't looked forward to each issue coming out in a series for a long, long time.  The art is beautiful and the writing is top notch.  Storylines which began for the X-Men and Avengers back in Messiah Complex and Avengers Disassembled are tied up nicely and a new status quo is established.  I have to question why some of the reviewers even READ superhero comics if this did nothing for them.  As a 30 year fan of Marvel, this was just what I love to see in comics: action, fantastic art and plot resolutions! This book is as it was intended. It is your blockbuster summer movie. Thirteen issues of non-stop superhero fights that manage to squeeze in the plot points.<br /><br />Now the problems I do have with this book have solely to do with the product and not the content.<br /><br />1) The binding is not great. The dialogue sometimes slip into the binding.  A lot of the AR codes are inaccessable for the same reason.  For a book with a $75 cover price, glued binding is just not acceptable.<br /><br />2) This book was supposed to come with a digital code for the entire series. My copy did not come with a code.  The space where the code is supposed to be is BLANK.  This lack of quality control on Marvel's part is embarrassing and disappointing.  I am sure this is the reason the product was listed an unavailable on Amazon shortly after launch.  So far I've been unable to resolve this.  I emailed Marvel's customer support (I would go through Amazon, but what are they going to do? Send me another book they may or may not have the code?) last Friday when I got the book. I got an email Monday asking for a picture of the missing code. I immediately responded with a picture... and a week later, no response back, no code.<br /><br />3) And lastly, although I know better when I order any books from Amazon, the packing absolutely sucks.  I can count on getting bend corners and dents in my books anytime I order from them.  AMAZON, INVEST IN PACKING MATERIALS!!!  The book came in an oversized box to give the book plenty of room to bang around in and ONE air bag that sat on top of the cover, offering no protection to the corners that always seem to take a beating.  Hey, I would throw in a couple a bucks for good packing! Maybe have Amazon Prime PLUS where you give free 2 day shipping AND styrofoam peanuts.  Just a thought.orners and dents in my books anytime I order from them.  AMAZON, INVEST IN PACKING MATERIALS!!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|It's a fictional romance novel that in my opinion is one of the best I have read in a long time.  It has some humor in it that had me laughing out loud but the humor doesn't take away from the romance or play it down at all.<br /><br />You will need to read all 3 books for it to make sense and for you to fall in love with the characters.  It's like the Lord of the Rings books..they leave you hanging until you read all three novels.<br /><br />You have to read all three to get the entire storyline.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Carly Rae Jepsen's Kiss album is probably the best pop album released in 2012. It incorporates elements from the pop and dance genres of music and blends them together very well.<br />My ranks:<br />1. \\"Tiny Little Bows\\" 10/10<br />2. \\"This Kiss\\" 10/10<br />3. \\"Call Me Maybe\\" 10/10<br />4. \\"Curiosity\\" 10/10<br />5. \\"Good Time\\" (duet with Owl City) 10/10<br />6. \\"More Than a Memory\\" 10/10<br />7. \\"Turn Me Up\\" 10/10<br />8. \\"Hurt So Good\\" 10/10<br />9. \\"Beautiful\\" (duet with Justin Bieber) 9/10<br />10. \\"Tonight I'm Getting Over You\\" 9/10<br />11. \\"Guitar String / Wedding Ring\\" 9/10<br />12. \\"Your Heart is a Muscle\\" 8/10<br /><br />Overall, this album is a great piece of work and never fails to impress. I recommend this album to CRJ fans and anyone who likes pop and dance music in general.
B004X4QW42|5.0|As a fan of martial arts films, I thought I had seen all the good ones. Didn't think there was one out there that could impress me the way this film did. I picked IP Man to take up some time while I was on the plane. I was so engrossed in the movie that I watched it twice and told my brother about it. He then watched it and agreed that it is a \\"diamond in the rough.\\" I also did not know it was based on a true story. If you like action, you'll love it. The fight scenes are thrilling and the story line keeps you interested.
B004927I50|4.0|When Taylor Swift announced her new album in mid-2010, fans were wondering if she would top the commercially successful Fearless album and she did. Speak Now shows off that Taylor Swift has matured since her last album and that she is a force to be reckoned with. On the deluxe edition of the album, you're getting all of the pleasure of the standard Speak Now album along with a bonus disc featuring three new tracks (\\"Ours\\", \\"Superman\\" and \\"If This Was a Movie\\"), the acoustic versions of \\"Haunted\\" and \\"Back to December\\" and the pop mix of \\"Mine\\". The best songs on the album would have to be \\"Mine\\", \\"Sparks Fly\\", \\"Back to December\\", \\"Speak Now\\", \\"Mean\\", \\"The Story of Us\\", \\"Enchanted\\", \\"Better Than Revenge\\", \\"Haunted\\" and \\"Ours\\".
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|It was very fast reading and held my interest but had a hard time with a lot of the British words...example:  I didn't know what \\"trainers\\" were or net curtains....it's a book I'm reading for my \\"book club\\"...
B009LDXQGW|5.0|This album sounds amazing with headphones on. If you are going to listen to it I highly recommend you listen to whilst wearing headphones to truly appreciate every element; i.e. the beats and the lyrics.
B009WJ2XT6|4.0|I saw the movie last weekend and the only sections of music that popped out at me were the first opening two notes when Bond pops out into the hallway, and the instrumental take on Adele's Skyfall track while Bond is boating his way into the Komodo Dragon casino. The music blended so well into every scene, that it almost disappeared. And that's a GOOD thing.<br /><br />That said, I began listening to the music on the album just out of curiosity and I was pleasantly surprised after reading so many negative reviews. It's very understated music, for the most part, and not very \\"Bond-ish\\". After listening to the entire album, I have to say it's a very effective score. The movie itself, for those who haven't ventured out to the theater yet, are in for a bit of a surprise. The movie is as toned down as the music, very realistic and even heartbreaking. The music matches the tone of the movie perfectly, which is what it is supposed to do, and doesn't at all deserve the relatively low scores it has received.<br /><br />The Bond theme is peppered through the score here and there, to great effect, and the action cues are heart pounding and effective. It's an altogether different, less bombast score for the suave 007, but it has a very mature and sophisticated edge to it that is perfect for the movie. I do recommend seeing the movie first, otherwise you might not understand or appreciate the music for what it is.<br /><br />My only complaint about the score is \\"Bread Crumbs\\", which uses a completely unaltered form of the original James Bond theme. It felt out of place and while I do like the original song (or else I wouldn't even be here listening to this), I wanted a smoother maybe darker version of it in Newman's own style to fit the rest of the album a bit better.<br /><br />All in all, though, this is definitely worth a listen if you liked the movie!
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Massive, and well thought out method for assembly. I can't say I expect anything less from almost 30 years of playing with/assembling Lego \\"toys\\". I won't call this educational in the strictest sense, but it is definitely more fuel for the imagination. The bottom, with good reason, isn't truly finished, and the figures are not a great fit in the compartment, but to be scale.....no way.<br /><br />This is not a Lego set for the very young, but would be good for most mature pre-teens, and mid-teen Lego artisans. Younger than 10? Highly rare for a child under the age of 10 to have the patience and attention to detail that this model demands. If you are under 10 and did this, I commend you! If your child under 10 did this; you are to be commended along with that child!<br /><br />This was one of only a couple of Lego models I have built over the years that gave me sheer joy at every step. I hoped, and waited, and finally got what I longed for: Executor. Before you ask: I am 34. This took me nearly 20 hours, spread out, on a 6' x 6' table. I didn't rush, you probably shouldn't either, so expect to lose the use of the table for a while. Keep cats, and other acrobatic pets or small children at bay: there are many, many, small pieces. Make sure your surface (floor and table) are high contrast colors, like light blue, dark brown, or similar, so the pieces don't blend in.<br /><br />Best of luck, and enjoy!

B0044WUJQ0|4.0|They really should have stopped here.  Halloween 2 really is the last good Michael Meyers movie, and that includes the remakes.<br /><br />A solid sequel that continues the events from the first movie and works really well in that context.  If you liked the first Halloween, by all means follow it up with this... but you should probably just stop there.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Good story, well done, and at a good price. For $2 less than a single movie ticket I got more than my money's worth of good entertainment. If you like sci-fi you will probably love this movie.

1606995359|5.0|I really needn't say much. This book is perfect, quality and everything else. I did not grow up reading these but I sure wish I had! I could go on and on. But all of these fine reviewers have already said amazing things. I just thought I'd put in my 2 cents.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out because of its cast and wonderful reviews, and decided I wanted a \\"copy\\".  This film is delightful, funny, poignant, and thought-provoking.  I also bought the book by Deborah Moggash.  The original book is quite different from the movie, and I'm glad I saw the movie first.  The book is \\"darker\\" and more of a commentary on aging in this day and time.

B00177YA1K|4.0|This movie is a classic and is absolutely hilarious. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones do a great job and the chemistry on the screen is there, they feed off of each other. Tommy Lee does a great job of playing the veteran who has seen it all and Will comes in as the cocky rookie who makes all the mistakes and wise cracks. The film will have you laughing quite often and still manage to give you good action scenes. This film essentially is about Tommy recruits Will to be a member of the MIB and control alien populations on earth meanwhile chasing down a crazy massive cockroach.<br /><br />The laughs, action, and great acting earn it 4/5 stars it is well worth your time.
1439190275|3.0|Tried a similar diet called protein power, quite a few years ago, and it worked well. I hope this one will as well.
B00001ZWTT|3.0|Wild Wild West i think was well before its time. Today a movie like this would be a flop with the critics and a score with younger generations who want to laugh at odd humor. The movie isn't bad depending on how you look at it. The story clearly wasn't supposed to be serious due to the equipment and obvious lack of seriousness in the movie. The problem lies in many viewers who watch it do so and compare it to other movies. With Wild WIld West you can't compare it because it stands alone in its own group.<br /><br />The movie is funny, there are parts where you'll bust up laughing. But be warned that if you buy the movie you must remember not to take the plot seriously and to take it the way it was intended as a comedy. If they wanted to make a serious film many things wouldn't have been in the movie such as: Loveless and his chair. The vast array of go go gadget type machines Loveless had. Plus back in the early years after the civil war women wouldn't be running around half nude in lingerie (im not sure lingerie was around back then anyway). This film sort of reminds me of a early hangover. Its plot is silly and stupid yet for some reason the movie is still funny.<br /><br />To watch this movie you have to keep in mind that its intent was to be a silly comedy. if you can remember that then you'll probably enjoy the laughs. Im not sure there is much replay value to this movie maybe once a year.<br /><br />Overall this film did make me laugh with its comedy and obvious bad acting (minus Smith's acting). However the same acting that made me laugh is also a reason i took a star away from the film. The plot is ridiculous and overall a B-list film from A list actors. Its not bad and for the current amazon price of $0.01 I'd say you don't have much to lose in checking it out and getting some laughs and giggles.<br /><br />In closing the flaws in the films acting and plot only earned it 3/5 stars or an \\"It's OK\\" rating.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This was a gift. it shipped promptly and came in time for gift giving. The recipients loved it! They have been to the play's and love this story.
B000957O82|4.0|I was talked into watching this movie by my longtime girlfriend. I'm usually more into the action shoot em up types of movies not what i considered chick flicks. But to make her happy i agreed to watch it and i have got to say i was shocked because i liked it. Man watching that film made me wish i knew someone like Alex Hitchins (Smiths character) when i was trying to get my girlfriend who happened to be my dream girl. It would've helped so much.<br /><br />The plot of this film follows Alex Hitchins a man who was a late bloomer when it came to dating. He quickly learned social skills that helped him get any girl he wanted. He made a life choice to do it for a living helping out guys who without his extensive knowledge of women wouldn't stand much of a chance. Enter Kevin James who plays an accountant who is absolutely in love with a rich and famous girl. He went to hitch for his help. Hitch reluctantly agrees to help him thinking it was a long shot at best. In the mean time Hitch is pursuing Eva's character who is a workaholic reporter/columnist for a paper. That is a summary of the first few minutes of the film without giving up anything important or spoilers.<br /><br />This film is surprisingly good. It really makes you think and im sure it is a great confidence boost for guys who have issues talking to girls. I firmly believe what Will's character said \\"Any guy has a chance to sweep any girl off her feet... he just needs the right broom\\" I firmly believe that and this film does in subtle ways tries knock down thoughts that may be in some guys heads that a girl is too good for him. This film will have you laughing one minute and the next hoping the relationship works out.<br /><br />The acting is all great, Will Smith did a great job playing a guy who knows a lot about women and getting people into relationships but is afraid of relationships of his own. Eva did a great job of playing the sexy but emotionally unavailable workaholic who is falling in love with Smith. Finally Kevin did very good at being a clumsy accountant starry eyed in love.<br /><br />This movie wont disappoint you it is outstanding 4/5 stars. Its great for a date night or a romantic night planned for that special someone who may not want an action movie and rather a drama. This is one that will satisfy the girls need for a chick flick yet isn't too drama filled that a guy cannot enjoy it.<br /><br />Worth the money
B0059WTMLW|5.0|It has many options to keep track of the numbers by colors, as well as different ways to play the game and different levels.
B009AMANH4|5.0|In recent years, movies centering on historical figures have turned out sloppy (The Iron Lady, J. Edgar) mostly due to the trend of packing a life story into two hours. Speilberg wisely avoids that mistake by focusing on the biggest accomplishment of Lincoln's presidency and the battle to get it done.<br /><br />Here, finally, is a historical drama that is actually well written and directed in addition to having great performances by the cast.<br /><br />This is probably the second most restrained film of Speilberg's career. There is very little melodrama in this film's two and a half hour running time. Even John William's score is mostly quiet, creating a contemplative mood in its viewers, underscoring the mindset of the film's central character.<br /><br />Even though the film focuses mostly on one month in the life of Abraham Lincoln, his life story comes through in his interactions with Mary, Tad, Robert, Seward and others, providing a more complete sense of who Lincoln was than in any other film about him.<br /><br />This is definately a must see film (eventually a must own film in my blu-ray collection) and one that deserves every accolade it should (and most likely will) win.
B004EK91LQ|4.0|This movie gave me exactly what I am was hoping for: great dancing. A plot so paper thin that it makes tissue paper look like cardboard, but great, fun, exciting dancing. Pretty much hip hop only, a little parkour (is that dancing? but okay) and one tango scene. Watch it for what it was made for, not for it's depth of character development, if you catch my drift.

B009ZTLPJM|5.0|While not quite as heavy as Superunknown or Badmotorfinger, it's still a very riff driven sound.  It sounds like an amalgamation of Down on the Upside/Superunknown but new and fresh.  They've stuck with their roots but aren't completely stuck in the past.  I was very skeptical at first after hearing Been Away for Too Long, but that's actually the weakest song on the album, it just gets better and better from there.

Overall, this is my first Seiko and automatic watch and would recommend this for the price. I read some of the issues the other people had, but you have to see for yourself.

B0062O85IW|5.0|I was looking for a reference book on Excel and found the Excel 2010 Bible.  After reading the comments I ordered the Kindle edition.  If you read the notes you will a complaint that the CD that comes with the book is not available in the Kindle edition.  You will also notice that the author has posted a note that if you email him he will provide you with a link to the supplemental information.  After downloading the book I emailed Mr. Walkenbach per the comment listed.  He responded and sent me a link to the CD material less than 2 minutes after I sent the email.  You cannot ask for better service than that.  I have used the book specifically as a reference for some things that I was trying to do with functions and pivot tables.  The book answered all of my question.  I highly recommend the book for beginners and advanced users alike.

Sadly, this one was just not one I wanted for my collection.  I want my music to speak of emotion and feeling.  Mr Stewart has many recordings that do just that.  But, not this one.  There is another CD out there, which I have reviewed also, that is full of feeling and wonderful carols and hymns (even a new one, to me that is tender and beautiful)  Hope you all find it.

0439023513|4.0|Mocking ay by Suzanne Collins a great book for readers who are looking for adventure, action, and an interesting storyline. However, the book does create a graphic picture of children being used as pawns for other peoples enjoyment. The children are seen as expendable and there is no value on life in the society created. I recommend this book to young adult readers. I liked how the book set up a complicated love triangle between Gale, Peeta, and Katniss. This triangle has been present in all the book and Katniss must make a decision soon if she ever wants to be happy. The book also presents a dystopian society. This society is one where there is a collective loss of memory where children are not seen as innocent, but are exclusively plunged into a warlike setting to commit graphic atrocities for the capitol, like in the earlier books where the young Rue is graphically murdered. The dystopian society also portrays the lack of personal freedoms given to the districts. The districts are basically slaves of the capitol that are each given a resource to produce and that is their only job. The districts fear of the capitol allows them to be subjected to the capitol's demands and commands. Also, the book presents good conflicts between the districts and the capitol, but also good external and internal conflicts for Katniss that shapes the way her character develops throughout the book. While the districts fight for their common goal for liberty and freedom, Katniss continuously fights for her families life and her contradicting feelings between Gale and Peeta. Lastly, this is what I think the author did well with creating a good development of Katniss through all three books. Katniss has to develop from a rebellious teenager in district twelve to a soldier in the Capitol's Hunger Games and then to a rebel fighting for her family and districts's freedom. While the book was good there were some negatives to it. First, the war between the Capitol and the rebels is a little far fetched, the Capitol is supposed to be very powerful and have dominance through technology and air superiority. However, the conflict between the Capitol and the rebels seems to also lean towards the rebels since the start even when the capitol is supposed to be very powerful to keep the districts as slaves for many years. The rebels never seem like they have a massive offensive however they easily push to the Capitol with little peacekeeper resistance. Also, Katniss is not given a big enough role in the rebel. I don't know if this was planned, but many characters seem to overshadow Katniss like Gale and Finnick in bringing the rebellion to victory. Katniss seems to mostly be dealing with her internal struggle than actually fighting for her people, and throughout the book she mostly follows orders than being the independent person she was in the earlier books. In all, I think this book was very successful in ending the Hunger Games trilogy and excelled in solving all the conflicts including Katniss's internal struggles.
0345803485|1.0|I am a fan of the genre, and since it was a best seller, and with all the hype,  I expected it to be at least borderline interesting.  Sadly, it was not.  And it was terribly written.  The author seems to have a very limited vocabulary, as limited as our heroine's.  A teenager's diary would have been of a higher calibre than this drivel.  Still, as several have pointed out, you don't have to be a good writer to have a best seller, just good PR.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I read the book before I saw the movie. It is one of my favorite books and now movie. I have watched the movie three times and will watch it again. It gives great insight in to the injustices done to the black community in the sixties. Their struggle began long ago but this book helped me to see what they endured for hundreds of years. Have your children watch this movie and try to explain to them to be kind to all people no matter what their race.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|... and I've seen some bad ones.  As a person that has no problem with suspension of disbelief if there is ANY redeeming quality, I can only say that this was an unbelievably bad movie.  Bad story and worse execution topped off by cheesy CGI.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is fun for all ages. And this package has every version of the film you could possibly need.
B001J710Y8|5.0|I was introduced to this movie a few years ago, and ever since then, I've been a big fan of it.  I loved all the unspoken references and nods to pre-Christian religion in the background, the film was just saturated with it in quiet ways that largely go over the heads of those who aren't familiar with pagan relics, practices, and history of western Europe.  The way it was done was very respectful and was not offensive to modern-day neo-pagans, I would think.<br /><br />I don't think I agree with the designation of \\"Horror\\" category.  Mystery, Suspense, Thriller, any one of those would have been more fitting.<br /><br />I do wish though that I had the LE version that came in the wooden box though.  Although it's just a minute or two longer, the cut out bits do add a little bit of context.  I''m glad that was the version I saw first before buying this abbreviated one, otherwise I would have missed out on a few subtleties.<br /><br />I'm not so good with writing movie reviews, but I will say simply that if you have a healthy appetite for a little bit of corniness, a tolerance for watching other cultures through a non-Judeo-Christian lens, and an appreciation for reserved and restrained acting delivery (for the most part)... then you might find yourself enjoying this film.

0307200477|3.0|I bought Pat the Bunny for the a child in Germany.  She is the granddaughter of a good friend of mine who also a German.  Each year I buy the little girl an age-appropriate classic American child's book as a birthday gift.  I was excited to send Pat the Bunny as this year's addition to her little English library.<br /><br />I had only one choice when I purchased the book - the deluxe edition.  Of course, its deluxe status meant a higher price.  The fact that it was in a larger format, that it had pages restored from the original book from the 1940's, and that it was in a box with a dust cover did not impress me - and would mean nothing to the child.  The quality of the deluxe edition was fine, but it was just too much.  I wanted the simple, little Pat the Bunny book that I have read to nieces and nephews so many times.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would give a choice:  if there is a deluxe edition of any book, also make sure there is just the normal, simple, basic version available.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this to be a very good read.  I have read a few books of this nature and always questioned their validity.  This book was written with authority and conviction and gave me an  entirely different look at the after life experience.  I believe the author really did see and feel what he stated and gave great documentation about what and why it happened.  I have always heard the scientific views on NDE and wondered if in fact they were correct, with a person who studies the brain as thoroughly as he has writing this book, it made me see that my religious beliefs are in fact correct.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I love this tv series and it is great to have both seasons with the pilot!  It came quickly and that is always appreciated as well.
B000A2IPPK|2.0|I guess you could call it a Classic if one wanted to, but it really hasn't held up too well in my estimation. The theme & the CG of the day was alright when it came out, but I could barely watch it with my 4yr old grandson recently. He liked it but wouldn't even sit for it to completion in 1 sitting. I couldn't recommend this movie for anyone's entertainment value past the age of 7.[[ASIN:B000A2IPPK E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (Full Screen Edition)]]
0545101417|5.0|Both my daughter and I have read the book, but we really enjoy audio books in the car. It was fantastic to listen to and the woman who reads it has a great voice.

B000P0J0A6|3.0|This is a nicely done tale. It has warmth, feeling, and shock value in a cute & entertaining way. Could have done without the racist remark at the end of the movie, but unfortunately; when people in the entertainment field get a little too much Fame and or Money; they get the grandiose idea that their political feelings should of course be everyone's viewpoint. Steven Spielberg, for as formulamatic as his films are, has found his niche in life; even if it is mostly in his own mind. I don't know how many times I have said it or heard someone else exclaim it after being ambushed with a racial or political aside in what is supposed to be a mere entertainment diversion- Keep your Politics to yourself! If the film were about Aliens then his comment could have been taken as a blanket statement about the human condition. Since the IDMB website lists these (imaginary) creatures as an animal indigenous to China that somehow turn into Demons when not cared for properly; we cannot assume the aforementioned. I watch movies for they're entertainment value, not what the Producer or Director flavor of the week thinks about other Races or Political issues. It's 1 of the main reasons Fun With Dick And Jane with Jim Carrey was a forgettable movie along with many others. Hey! We don't want to hear it! I'm standing here with my kids and our $40.00 worth of candy, pop, and popcorn. Think maybe we're dressed up for fun here!? Gremlins (Special Edition)

B007K87C4M|4.0|I am a fan of Porcupine Tree and some of Steven Wilson's solo work, but I am not a fan of Opeth. When I first heard about this project that the two lead men were concocting I had my suspicions. All that I was familiar with about Opeth was that the music was sometimes very pleasant, but the vocals drove me nuts. Steven Wilson has also seemed to delve into the more darker, obscure realm of rock recently as well, so the two combined seemed like a match to create some sort of musical chaos in terms of my personal musical preference. Fortunately, I was pleased with the outcome of my gamble with this album.<br /><br />As mentioned before, I am not really a fan of the musical styles that Opeth have produced, nor am I a fan of a lot of the more obscure, avant-garde approach that Wilson has taken. When I first listened to this record I had expected to find something along the lines of what I was dreading. And I will say that when I heard 'Drag Ropes' for the first time I thought that I was going to receive exactly what I had expected. However, that song finished, and I was suddenly pulled through to the title track. This was it. This was what I had been waiting to hear from Wilson for so long. It seems that I have waited ages for Porcupine Tree to return to form due to my nostalgia caused by the beauty of records such as '[[ASIN:B00123AYNM In Absentia]]' and records previous to that. In this track, however, I felt like the wait was over, and I was much more obliged to listen to the rest of them album for a proper and honest digestion.<br /><br />My final thoughts on the piece is that it is much better than I was expecting it to be. There are still some songs that I cannot always convince myself to sit completely through--I still skip 'Drag Ropes' almost every time I listen to the album--but as a whole piece of art the album really stands above a lot of other music. I may stand alone in finding Wilson's solo album '[[ASIN:B005LZZMRK Grace For Drowning]]'--many fans' proclaimed Wilson masterpiece--quite disappointing, but I hope that I am not the only one who realized that 'Storm Corrosion' truly is a unique treasure. Even if you do not enjoy Opeth, or Wilson's solo work, or Porcupine Tree, you may want to give this album a shot; you may just find yourself surprised in the end.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|My wife had read the books.........I'm now beginning book two.  She thought the movie did a good job representing the book.  Very entertaining.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|An entertaining game...not too hard not too easy. The graphics were well done and the game as a whole was well laid out and engaging
030746363X|4.0|When I first got this book in the mail, I was ready to send it back.  It was huge!  There was no way I was going to read the whole thing.  Then, after reading the intro, I found that depending on my goals and what I wanted to get out of the book, I only had to read certain sections.  It is very informative and I found it interesting.
B0086700CM|5.0|i have wanted a game like this since second grade.now low and behold!magic is real.if not making this game was.......i don't know.
0307592731|5.0|You know it's a good book when you're sad that it ends.  Awesome journey about the outdoors and overcoming adversity in life.  I was a little shocked at all the coarse language, but it wasn't enough to turn me off.  The honesty was refreshing and you truly felt you were on the journey with her.<br /><br />My least favorite part was probably how short the ending was when she finally reaches her destination.  But as they say, it was more about the journey than the destination.  Highly recommend!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Her wonderful soprano voice soars again!  At first when listerning to the CD I thought the male voices were overpowering her voice.  Then listening a second time on a better sound system, I realized that this CD is one her best! Bravo Susan!
B005PK1G76|5.0|this is a great product. it works very well on my bugaboo camelon stroller. very happy with this purchase and the price was PERFECT!
B000PMG16U|5.0|I purchased this for my sons 6 year old birthday. The hug that he gave me when he saw what I had given him said it all. Great price and quick delivery
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|this was a very on point movie. cant wait for the sequal to come out because this movie did not disappoint one bit
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Tim Burton crafted the first real Batman Movie and it was absolutely amazing. I absolutely loved it from beginning to end. Jack Nicholson was born to play The Joker. He has the personality down perfectly because it is similar to may of his other roles. Its not that he is playing himself rathe he is playing The Joker who behaves like many of the other psychotic characters that Nicholson has portrayed. He has some of the most memorable lines in the film and the way he conveys it makes it even more memorable. Michael Keaton is simply awesome as Batman and Kim Basinger is a great love interest for him. Everything about this movie is classic, powerful and unforgettable. Its one of the most classic films ever made. I have some of the most wonderful memories of my childhood because of this movie. It is one of the most iconic endings of all time.
0425263908|5.0|If you enjoyed the series 50 Shades of Grey then this one is for you.  Easy read and thoroughly entertaining.  I can't wait to finish this series.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Michael Keaton is brilliant as Batman, Michelle Pfieffer is magnificent as Catwoman, and Danny Devito is mesmorizing as the penguin. Christopher Walken is great as the villian that is helping Penguin. I love all the characters in this story and I love the visuals that help bring this timeless and beautiful story to life. Catwoman is my favorite of the new characters in this movie. I love that she treds the line between good and evil. She not the villian of the picture but the Anti-heroin. She is keeps the audience on their toes throughout the entire picture. She makes this movie a blast to watch. The story is emotional, moving, and very somber and eerie. It is the darkest Batman film ever made and in my opinion one of the best. Tim Burton crafted a genius film and its a shame he didnt direct the sequel Batman Forever.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is amazing Pinterest has a bunch of great ideas for every age!<3 must have a twitter Facebook or email to have an account though!
0316228532|4.0|First, after doing a quick glance at others reviews from 1 - 5 stars, I would love to be able to filter out any that didn't mention \\"Harry Potter\\" within them. I guess it is too much to expect, but I am curious how people who didn't like this book would have felt if it was written by someone else. Clearly they have nothing in common and there should be no comparison. In any case, I really liked this book. I want to say I loved it, but I had a few issues, so I won't go all '5 Stars' but it's close. In the beginning, I did have trouble keeping the characters straight but by the end of the book, it was no longer an issue. Maybe it's because I live in a small town that I found the entire story completely believable. The political alliances and back room shennanigans with regards to local elections is intense to say the least. I loved the way all these lives intertwined, even though the people themselves don't realize it. I couldn't help but remember the line from \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\": \\"One man's life touches so many others.\\" My one complaint is that I wish there was more closure on some characters storylines. But then again, maybe that's why she left it that way - life goes on. And so it will in Pagford and The Fields.
0446580848|5.0|Nelson DeMille has done it again.  He does his research and delivers a well written tale of John Corey's adventures defending our country from the bad guys.  This also is movie material.  Anyone that loves his writing will love this book.
B008NMT684|4.0|My three year old son loves this puzzle game. He knows it's just like his wooden puzzles, but it also helps him learn to use a tablet, which I think will be his textbooks in the future.
B0091REZMW|5.0|played a lot of this type game and usually finish too fast. This one has kept me going for a long time and I'm not bored yet. Don't have friends who play so it's a little hard to get what I need sometimes. Can't get to far to fast without spending any money but I'd be buying games anyway so why not on a game I know I like. Good game!!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|For this price, this music player is very impressive. Easy to use and setup. The one minor issue is that there is a slight background humm, but that is only noticed on music that was created with the volume a bit on the low side. Unlike some other players, it is simple to change FM transmission frequencies to avoid interference. It found all the music in all my folders. You will not be disappointed with this player.
B007RKPO84|4.0|The title track is thrash PERFECTION!  Phantom Antichrist is a SICK tune.  If you LOVE that one then try the rest of the CD but that song is a freaking must!
B00377E5SG|5.0|This movie was perfect for a night with the girls.  Total chick flick.  Romance, Love and a Happy Ending.  Funny too!
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Typical Connelly suspense always has a few twist and turns to keep you in suspense, once I start reading his work. I cannot put the book down until I have finished, So I only read on weekends with enough time. I rate Connelly up there with John Grisham
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This movie is very good and fun. I have lost count on how many times I have watched it. It keeps you interested and wanting to see more.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great listening. You can hear stations from all over the USA and many overseas stations. This is a must radio if you like to listen the talk radio and music!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Outstanding application.  Does everything we want and so much more.  Loaded it on our FIRE and no problems encountered what-so-ever.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|And this is a BIG but, the developer included settings on the kindle version that are specific to an android phone such as talk/video call time. These settings are virtually useless on the kindle and just use up real estate and resources. All the dev did was port over the app from the android version without tailoring it for the kindle. These settings/notifications may prove to be of more use on the KFHD as it has a camera for video chat, but that reveiw will have to wait until I have the KFHD.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|So many times I have purchased computer tools where the metal is soft and the bits will strip on trying to loosen tight mini and micro screw heads.  This is the first kit that seems to be made as a quality tool kit that has durable bits that can be used time after time.  Great tool set for the professional tech or hobbyist and would make a great gift.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|There  was a good finish to the story.  I'm a fan of reading series, and this trilogy hit the mark with me.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|I hate to compare albums, so I'll try not to, but I will say that if Medulla was not your thing, and Volta didn't get your attention, this might be the record that grabs you and pulls you back to Bjork as there are no \\"annoying\\" periods on Biophilia (admit it, Medulla was hard to listen to that first spin). With only ten songs, Biophilia manages to achieve a thoroughly focused sound. Biophilia has a unique sound all to its own with a prevalent motif found throughout the entire record, yet there is much diversity within this album. This time, Bjork harnesses beautiful melodies, lush choirs, captivating rythyms, eerie moods, short blasts of intense break-beats, custom-made instruments, and much more. The lyrical theme of Biophilia is focused on natural and scientific subjects including geology, microbiology, astrology, and other topics.<br /><br />This record is in part a return to more traditional songs (traditional by the standards of Bjork, anyways), but Biophilia is definitely new territory. Bjork continues to push the boundaries of her music catalogue and once again delivers a record unlike anything you've heard before. This time, however, it is instantly brilliant, comfortable, and captivating all at the same time.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|This product was exactly what I was expecting, I wanted both Blu Ray and DVD.  Good quality, as it was brand new.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|great movie....great plot about the old days and how the first oil men became rich.  Recommend to everyone.  Takes you to a time and makes you feel like your there.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless is such a unique military memoir because the whole story from start to finish is amazing and unique.<br />Even the really good military and special ops memoirs that have been recently released, or that I have sold well tend to follow the same formula of getting bogged down early on by being overly in depth with the author's pre service life. Examples of this are Richard Marcinko's Rogue Warrior, Howard Wasdins SEAL Team Six, Don Manns Inside SEAL Team Six etc.  Let's face it; people are buying these books to read about the SEALs or whatever branch is emphasized on the cover of the book.  If you are burning 80 to 100 plus pages early on, the real interesting portion of why you purchased the book in the first place does not get into full swing until much later on.<br />However, the story here is so unique and rare I was sucked in from start to finish. I didn't feel that one page was unnecessary filler.  Even if you are not a fan of military reading material, this story is still worth checking out. There is a good amount of info about the SEALs but there was so much adversity and hardship that was overcome that anyone could find something to like about this memoir. I cannot think of any reading material that I have come across that is in the same league as this.
0345803485|1.0|I really regret buying the trilogy. I was not able to finish half of the first book. I was extremely boring and repetitive. I wander how this author managed to sell so many books.<br />I am very fond of reading...just finish \\" Atlas Shrugged\\" from  Ayn Rand...that's a book.<br />Please don't spend neither time nor money!
030758836X|5.0|Very interesting novel. I think men should read this book as well. They need to know what some woman might have in their minds!....
B0098460O4|5.0|I found myself returning to \\"Britain's Got Talent\\" just to hear Jonathan and Charlotte sing!<br /><br />I was so happy to see that they were composing a CD that I pre-ordered it and waited expectantly!<br /><br />I have just received their first CD  and it is masterful - absolutely beautiful and so inspiring!  Every time I listen to it I am struck by the beauty of their voices!!!<br /><br />Their CD has become my first choice as a gift for my loved ones - a blessing such as this must be shared!!!<br /><br />May the Lord continue to lead and guide both of you and<br /><br />May He give you the desire of your heart<br />  and make all your plans succeed.  Psalm 20:4<br /><br />Blessings and prayers that you stay close to Him,<br />Anna
B007VUA7VO|3.0|It helps me keep track of my battery power. I like the easy to read display that shows how long I have left to do different things. It worked great until I used the calibration feature and then my kindle suddenly started dragging really badly and acting weird. Had to remove app and after trying others came back to this app because it is the better free option out of those I have tried. Sadly my kindle still acts slower than it ever did before even in the period after I removed the app and the period before I put it back on my kindle. Only recommendation I have is that you may want to not take advantage of calibration but as a simple battery app to see where you battery is then it is a good one. It can be easier than going through the kindle menu to check battery levels and it does have more info than the kindle basic device info.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|everyone: llalalala im so bored. Recap: This book was ok, but needs more acton and a climax! Man, I could write a better book!
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is good in the beginning gets a little more confusing as you get more involved. U must really pay atension to where all your buildings are and things like the placement of your bus stations and tech stations is inportant too. The only thing that confuses me is how u can have a building producing products and ship it to the mall and have a negative number of products show up on your count for delivery.
0446580848|2.0|This was my first \\"John Corey\\" book and my last.  I found The Panther boring and the constant wise cracks by the book's main character tiresome.  I may not finish the book and I would spend my money on a Vince Flynn novel!
0307744434|5.0|The cover of this book has been grabbing my attention for months. The synopsis didn't grab me right away, but I had also read Water for Elephants and was not a huge fan, so I was a bit scorned by the circus stories.<br /><br />This was nothing like other circus stories. This was nothing like any other stories at all.<br /><br />I started this book on audiobook. I HIGHLY recommend this audiobook. The reader had such an exquisite accent and voice. He was genuinely a pleasure to listen to. Also, I know this book starts off a little slow, so having it read to you in such an appealing voice helps to make up for that. I have to admit, less than halfway through, I had to get the actual book from the library because listening to it in the car was just not enough.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I'll say this...<br />This is probably the best writing I have encountered in any book, anywhere. Morgenstern is an artist. She paints such a magnificent dream with her writing. This book was not a story. This book was an entire world within itself. This was something to immerse yourself in. This is the kind of story that feels like home. Somewhere you can visit, escape to. Like a dream.<br /><br />I could not wait to get back to it. And when I was away from it, I couldn't stop thinking about it.<br /><br />I love that this book has a plethora of highly developed characters.<br />I love that the romance is genuine and sweet without being overbearing or redundant.<br />I love everything about this book.<br /><br />I cannot say it enough.<br /><br />Read. this. book.<br /><br />FIVE very sentimental stars.<br /><br />Find more of my reviews at [...]
B008JGSM6G|5.0|more challenging than expected. welcome break and alternative to solitaire, sudoku and zombies.  don't use your hints too soon.  . . .
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Thus game is great! The levels are challenging, but doable. Doesn't leave you frustrated like other games. And the story line is cute and amusing. Great for adults who enjoy casual gaming, and kids to pass the time. Love it!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I would definitely purchase this app again! You get to do however many notebooks you like, with different covers and titles. This app has a neat set-up and a easy lock system in case you want to use this as a diary notebook tool.
B002ZG99A4|1.0|I watched this with my girl Mary Jane, and we were literally on the floor laughing our arses off. Stallone is a genius!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun and addictive mind work has always been a great time passer for me. I really like this app. It has alot of levels and gives you good mind concentration.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love all of these books!! They are so addicting! I can't put the book down. This is a must read!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app put me to sleep in 5 minutes. The only down side is you have to turn off your kindle afterwards or plug it in to a power source so you won't waste battery.
B003XT603Q|5.0|This book reminded me Albert Camus's \\" The outsider\\" but this is more simple and full of joy. I recommend this as a relaxing book when you want to get rid of boring work or study reading :)
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Great book, well written with an end you won't see coming. Great book club read. I would highly recommend this page turner.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a must watch show... you will become addicted to it guaranteed!!!  After every show ends you can't wait for your next fix.  Watch it you will not regret it!!!!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Originally I only watched Castle because I knew it's star from Firefly (awesome if short-lived scifi show), but it's become one of my favorite shows. The characters are multifaceted, the writing is sharp, and the sense of humor is quirky in just the right way.
B008JAGG38|5.0|This reunion had everyone from the original movie and it was funny.  If you like really<br />funny movies and are ready for gross humor like The Hangover, 40 year old Virgin, and The League,<br />then you will enjoy this movie.  Another not familar with the characters should probably watch the original first
0345803485|5.0|I was hooked and refused to sleep because I just had to start book two.  The best option is to order all three books together.  If I had a boyfriend at the time...have mercy :)
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Fun, funny - great cast of characters.  Lots of surprises with the directions the story goes.  Would definately recommend it.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|VERY ADDICTIVE READING AND  HARD TO PUT DOWN. LOTS OF CONCENTRATION NEEDED TO KEEP UP WITH THE FAST CHANGING SCENARIOS.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this book. The first really got me involved. The twists and turns really keep you involved, nothing just simply works out for katniss.  Great book
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Took a chance on this gem, and love wearing this watch.  It took some getting used to, I never had an automatic.  With a full wind, the watch will give 40 hours with no movement.  I've tested many times and always found 40 hours.  The band has lasted, and back display is really nice.  Functionally, it's really on time.<br /><br />Very nice presentation, and style.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Soon as I started reading it couldn't put it down. Characters are awesome! You can imagine the people in the districts with their colorful makeup and clothes. Rue dying broke my heart in a billion pieces.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have Been looking for  a good book and this was it..  brought me right into the story..could not put it down
B007Y36K46|3.0|Viually, it was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the flow and action. As far as the story went, I was truly disappointed at how much the storyline of the book was mangled, especially as far as the plotline of the Therns travelling between planets and stalking E.R.B on earth. That was such a disappointment and a letdown. I do awn it and will put my brain on the shelf to watch and enjoy, but it could have been so much better.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|I have seen a lot of videos and concert footages by RONNIE JAMES DIO and RAINBOW of the 80s and.  However, this concert represents the best music that they have ever performed.  I love the beginning of the concert when that play THE WIZARD OF OZ movie and a revised intro of OVER THE RAINBOW, as well as the end fo the concert with the actual OVER THE RAINBOW.  The music on this concert is true 70s style, especially with the guitar and organ riffs.  My favorite songs are LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL and DO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES.  I also love the way that COZY POWELL uses both base drums throughout most of each song unlike other double base drummers. That was the first thing I noticed about him when watching LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL for the first time on YOUTUBE.  The lineup on this video (RICHIE BLACKMORE, BOB DAISLEY, RONNIE JAMES DOI, COZY POWELL, AND DAVEY STONE)should have reunited in the 90s both the unfortunate deaths of COZY POWELL AND RONNIE JAMES DIO who along with BLACKMORE were the most consistant members of one of the greatest rock groups of the 70s.
B00992CF6W|1.0|give me money. buy more coins so u can be better at this game. gameplay was horrible. instructions were written by a 5yr old. not recommended.
B005FISBTO|1.0|*** DIDN'T SEE SEASON SIX YET *** Just wanted to thank all you reviewers.  I am just finishing season 5 and have been watching it on \\"instant video.\\"  Enjoying it much more than watching seasons 1-4 on disc which plays those stupid Showtime promos.  I'm usually a traditionalist and love watching stuff on the big T.V. But in this case, not worth it.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Good read, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the outdoors and the spiritual bond that is created on ones journey through nature.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I saw someone using this app on TV and it looked like fun.  BUT..........This app never worked on my Kindle Fire HD. Every time I tried to run it, it froze my device, so I deleted it. A complete waste.
B0054JURZA|5.0|This was easily my favorite album of 2011, and it's probably in my top ten. I find myself listening to it all the time. When I'm not listening to it I find myself thinking about listening to it. Although Justin isn't exactly the most clear singer, the music itself is beautiful. I don't even care what he's singing about, I just want to listen again and again and again.<br />The album is most remarkable in its cohesiveness, each song just flows into the next. They all sound totally different but it just works. Even the 80's synth slow-jam, Beth/Rest (which happens to be my favorite track and gives me chills every time).
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but couldn't even get through the whole thing.  The character development was terrible and a lot of the plot was really predictable and not in an ironic way.  The only thing that's of note is the action scenes which were pretty great.  For me though, even the action wasn't worth watching the whole movie and suffering through the characters and dialogue...
B000TRXN6W|4.0|This album is more subdued than Norah's other stuff...but then again, some might call that maturity! Regardless, Norah has an amazing voice and her style is all her own. This album just makes me think of bundling up on a cold rainy day with a book and this playing in the background.
B005VJ8ATS|4.0|This is one of the most enjoyable movies i've seen lately. The science fiction setting is really nothing more than a back drop and a way for the main character to find redemption.<br />And thats what the movie is really about. Screwing up horribly, trying to make amends and finding a way to apologize when you've wronged someone in a way you cant apologize for.<br /><br />if youre looking for a movie about people, this is a great story. just let the sci fi aspect float in the background because thats where it will stay if you let it.
B007MU85D0|5.0|One of my favorite albums of the year. Some people might be a little annoyed with all the &#34;Hey!&#34;s interspersed in the songs (okay, there are a lot), but overall a very strong album covering a full range of talents.
0897500482|5.0|excellent for exercising I thought it gave a good insight into improving your skills or learning a new way of thought
B005XRU62C|5.0|This album is very strong in every sense of the word. The songs are very big and booming. If I didn't know better I'd think this album was designed for concert performances at large arenas! Then again, Florence has such a powerful voice that she can pull this off. I find myself listening to this album quite frequently, even months after I bought it. Some parts of this album are more brooding than others (What the Water Gave Me, anyone?) but I find myself gravitating to these darker songs -- Florence's voice is just so well-suited to them.<br />I am hesitant to say it, but I think this album is better than Lungs. Different, definitely. Both are remarkable but I find myself listening to this one just a little bit more.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've read virtually all of Grisham's books. This was another well written one. I couldn't put it down. The ending was a bit of a surprise.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I'm still reading this book. I think it is great book because the author give us specific samples with a lot information how our children succeed. How the family and another intervention programs could help. Optimistic book!!.
B007V0Q8HQ|5.0|This is a group who needs no introduction...they're songs say it all. Ever since I got this album I haven't been able to stop listening to it because I can't find anything better. There are so few musicians out now who are as candid as this band and speak straight from their hearts. Please keep it coming!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third book is less intense than the other two, but,  anyway, it's still very entertaining.<br />You can see the end of the story...
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|very handy for making grocery and christmas lists.  also good for reminders on things i need at our lake house.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great!!! Homeland is great show from the first episode. Every episode gets better and more captivating!! Unlike most T.V series, there are no filler shows to make a full season. So far the second season is following the same recipe for a great season!! A MUST SEE!!!!
B008J34466|4.0|I love pink! I Like this cd but its not as good as some of her others. Maybe if I listen to it a few more times I will love it like I do her other albums
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great Book! Read through it like Wild Fire! Great followup to the Hunger Games Book #1. Now reading the 3rd book The Mockingjay.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|If you are sensitive about expressing discomfort vis-a-vis the Middle East, don't read this book.<br />Consider it a viable antidote for the seductive brochures offered by the Yemen Tourist Organisation.<br />But, as balances go, the author has also some critical points to share about the CIA. Main protagonist is the cynical NYPD detective John Corey, who admittedly has a great sense of humour (at times). From the busy streets of New York, he finds himself tranferred to Yemen (isn't this a bit far fetched?) to hunt for a figure named The Panther: a US born islam terrorist who enjoys slashing throats of infidels. Of course he is not alone as he travels to the enticing lands of Yemen together with his wife (CIA) and a figure we remember well from that fabulous novel The Generals Daughter.<br /><br />This book is still fun to read, but is not the Nelson DeMille that dazzled me in the past. On a score of 1 (dreadful) to 10 (pageturner) I would rate it a 6/7.
0307719219|5.0|Incredible read. I love this book. I can't wait to use this as a basis for an economics course as my wife teaches our children at home. Fascinating and thoroughly unbiased.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I tried to resist buying this version of Angry Birds, but I've played every other version, and I'm hopelessly addicted to AB, so I bought it for my Kindle Fire HD. Angry Birds Space was a big leap forward, with the tricky orbital mechanics and Lagrange points, and Angry Birds Star Wars is another step up, with new kinds of birds and pigs that defend themselves, plus a little more AB Space to make it interesting.<br /><br />My only negative comment is that the game is a bit thin for the three bucks that I paid. I imagine that there will be free upgrades with new levels in the future. In the meantime, Rovio is selling more levels with in-app purchases. I understand why developers have in-app purchases for free games, but not for games that I already paid for. Come on, Rovio, you don't need to do this.<br /><br />Five stars for gameplay and enjoyment, but knock off a star for the in-app sales tactic.<br />----------------------------------------<br />Update (November 17, 2012): I've played most of the levels now, and I have to say this is a really fun game. It's not that difficult to complete most levels, but getting three stars is very challenging for some levels.
1451695195|3.0|Was not what I was expecting.  The story line started off slow with family background and progressed to the conclusion. It would have kept my attention if more detail to the \\"near death experience\\" had been covered and less medical terminology used.
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|My 5 yr old son got this for his birthday (I used part of it to decorate his cake!! Much cheaper than the official cake decorating set). He's too young to figure out the game, but has had endless fun setting up the blocks and knocking them down with the catapult. Six months later, he is still carrying around these little plastic birds and pigs, and still plays with it. For the price--that's pretty good!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Like Life Magazine and National Geographic. Magazine BBC has great image coverage along with the narrative. I would recommend this page to anyone that keeps up with wordly affairs, places and people.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|The CD itself arrived in excellent condition and the tracks in and of themselves are good quality.  I was disappointed that Adele's recording of Skyfall was not on the CD.  If I had known that, I would not have purchased this CD, but it is not the fault of the seller.  I wanted the Adele song.
B008458O3S|5.0|Great game,keeps you on your toes.I give it an ace,or 10 of 10. I would recommend to all, better than twirling your fingers
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I have watched every episode of Haven and love the show.  I was happy to hear that there will be a season 4 coming next year.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|The game is pretty good, 7 worlds with lots of levels (familiar formula). I thought it was annoying at first but thenI realized you can click the penguins to change their direction. Pretty fun I like it.
072325804X|5.0|An heirloom boxed volume. Wonderful illustrations, and all the charm of Beatrix Potter's characters. This is another treasure for a &#34;keeper's library&#34;.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this game last night and did all the 5x5 grids. Now I am on the 6x6 and it is a bit more of a challange. Its still fun though! Good puzzles to keep the brain sharp at my advanced age!
1609611543|5.0|Wheat (grains in general) are taking a beating in the new nutrition thinking. This book will explain why, and how many symptoms you'd not relate to food are traceable to it. This is a great book to go along with the low-carb and paleo lifestyles. You owe it to yourself to consider the information contained in this book. It's a classic.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|A breath of fresh air. The style in which it's written is very pleasurable. Really wonderful compared to all of the stupid vampire books out now a days!
B005OHSD3A|4.0|... and I mean a nutritional plan, not just a *reducing* diet. This book offers brief and understandable rationale for the &#34;whys&#34; of the lifestyle, and follows up with meals. It's a great guide for those who need structure and organization in acquiring a new eating habit, and most do, when going this route. It's not nearly as restrictive as the original Atkins was.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I love this game! Played non stop until I finished! For the price it is great. A little hesitant in places, but still a great game!
160309007X|3.0|Alan Moore cements his reputation as the Cranky Old Man of pop/genre culture with his latest iteration of the League of Extraordinary Gentleman. He's clearly slamming modern culture even as he appropriates it and bends it to his whims, which is pretty funny considering how much he hates people appropriating his works and reusing them in other forms.<br /><br />Almost redeemed by the ending which was a nice twist, who else would you call upon to deal with a naughty teenage anti-Christ? Certainly not our helpless protagonists.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I love this can't wait until season 3 starts and season 2 becomes available on DVD.  I look forward weekly when it was on.
B0058VW36U|2.0|There's something to be said for a casual game so simple its title is also its instruction manual, but for a game heavily dependent on the exact details of what one taps when, it's very bad at determining exactly what you've tapped when. You will have to replay a lot of levels because it can tell exactly what you've done.<br /><br />Also, the paid version of a game should NOT have any ads in it. I would probably have rated this at least 3 stars were it not for the ads.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this game because its like temple run but fifteenth its also a great app for the kindle fire!
B009AZZEU2|5.0|this is an awesome cd from an awesome band. finally after a hiatus for over a decade. great artists. from a fan of many years. some of the best music of the year.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|don't get me wrong its a lot of money but the game is totally worth it :*  get it awesome dealt awesome take my word
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|this is an awesome very balanced album. jacoby is sweet. ive been a fan for nearly 2 decades. hard hitting melodic old new and evolving too many haterz out there. they can get a life and kiss my a sszzzz
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|This dvd celebrates what used to be right with America.  The eventual fall of the U.S. will be from the demands of the un-vested, needy individuals set upon the dwindling number of available taxpayers.  Independent citizens are outnumbered by minorities with an entitlement attitude, who demand their share, of unearned entitlements.  Want to know what happened to Rome, look at the American fabric of victums today.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|All I could think when I read this was that I'm so lucky to have a normal mother. Flynn created mommy dearest on crack, the character of Adora was so impeccably created I found her so realistically frightening. Sometimes I had to stop reading because it was too intense.<br /><br />The forlorn, broken character of Camille was so well written I could feel all her pain and suffering with her. A character that continued to survive in spite of all the crap thrown her way. I highly recommend this book not only for the chilling murder mystery, but also for the great lines and well- constructed dialogue that makes reading this book an absolute delight.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|i love the Star Wars version of Angy Birds. It is  funny, clever, challenging, and has cool new jedi birds bent on destroying the dark side.  The only issue I have is that it did not save my progress yesterday so I am starting at square 1 today. hopefully a one time bug.
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson's HIStory Past Present Book 1 is a fantastic album and a great start to any Jackson collection. Not only does it contain a great new album but it also has an extensive book, great packaging, and a greatest hits disc. The case is well done and the discs have a gold finishing to them and contain a holographic image of Michael's statue outlined.<br /><br />Now in terms of content, even those who are disappointed with Dangerous will love this album. Michael went back to his older style of making songs 3-4 minutes. Long gone are the 7 minute songs from Dangerous that are full of repetition (I still think Dangerous is a great album though, just being honest). HIStory showcases Michael's wide range of vocals and song writing, along with the great studio production his records are well known for. This is one of the best mastered CDs I own and it sounds amazing. Bruce Swedien and the other recording engineers and studio musicians did a fantastic job making a deep, rich, layered sound. Not only on the songs on this shorter and more concise than albums like Dangerous, but the songs also have longer, more complex, catchy melodies in my opinion.<br /><br />This is the one album of Michael's that I like better than Thriller, I really enjoy his other material as well but HIStory to me is just one incredibly well done album. HIStory is not an album of love songs, the songs themes range from personal, media, and corporate greed, not being able to cope with losing your childhood, loneliness, and anger, and there are also 2 great cover songs in there as well.<br />Scream - Very gritty angry song that is also funky and powerful. A duet with Janet Jackson.<br /><br />They Dont Care About Us - Fantastic song about government and policing, authority figures not caring about their citizens. Done in a military style with crazy drum beats, vocals, and sound effects.<br />Stranger<br /><br />Stranger in Moscow - really overlooked gem from Michael, has riched layered sounds that are haunting while he sings about being alone wandering the streets of Moscow. Intense, deep lyrics such as \\"here abandonned in my fame armageddon of the brain\\".<br /><br />This Time Around - Really cool hip hop style track that also has a great verse by Notorious BIG, Michael sings this one angrily in regards to people trying to hunt him down saying stuff like \\"this time around Im taking no sh*t!\\"<br /><br />Earth Song- Really a masterpiece, the multiple layers to this song and complex melody are very well done. This is an incredibly powerful track about what will happen to the Earth, people, and animals if we let businesses and governments destroy it. Incredibly powerful.<br /><br />DS - This is a raw, powerful track that is mostly the same rocking guitar rift (by Slash) repeating itself. This is a cool, tough song by Michael, here he is not pleading for help but is just calling out the District Attorney who built up a false case against him and tried to humiliate him. It starts out with him saying \\"He wants to get my a** dead or alive\\". Its a great song and contrasts the peaceful softspoken Michael in Earth Song.<br /><br />Money - This one is awesome, has a shuffling beat to it and is about how people will do anything for money. Once again Michael is able to take a serious topic (greed) and turn it into one fantastic catchy track while still tackling the subject matter well. Another underrated gem.<br /><br />Come Together - Powerful more \\"rocking\\" cover of the Beatles classic. It is not as good as the Beatles version but is different and well produced enough to still be a fun and enjoyable song.<br /><br />You Are Not Alone - This was written by R. Kelly but is sung in a  very personal way by Michael. This is most likely because despite his fame and power he has dealt with personal loneliness for a lot of his life. The vocal delivery is top notch and the instrumentation is excellent.<br /><br />Childhood - This song is a really nice ballad that is Michael discussing his own issues and reasons of not being able to forget his Childhood. The song is very well done, very haunting, has a brilliant falsetto and the orchestration takes it to a new level. \\"Before you judge me, try hard to love me\\"<br /><br />Tabloid Junkie - Very quick, catchy song about the news \\"its slander \\" \\"tortures me \\" \\"parasite in black and white who would do anything for views\\".<br /><br />2 Bad - Urban hop hop track that contains a nice rap from Shaq. This is similar to This Time Around in that it is about him standing tall while every tries to hunt him down and \\"bring him to his knees\\". Pretty interesting track.<br /><br />HIStory - This track is about how every day creates HIStory, its done sort of like an anthem in terms of chorus and instrumentation. This is a nice title track for the album. It is far from the best but still good.<br /><br />Little Susie - This is Michael's 1 classical music composition (also has lyrics though). This one is sung like a poem of sorts, starts and ends with very haunting classical orchestration. It's about a girl who is murdered by being pushed down the stairs and throughout the song you find out more about her and how no one cared about her until she was dead. Very dark, disturbing track, it is well done though and would surprise most people who didn't know Michael sung about stuff like this or could work with classical music.<br /><br />Smile - Really nice Charlie Chaplin / Nat King Cole cover song with incredibly smooth vocals.<br /><br />HIStory is a really diverse album compared to Michael's other work. There is a sort of general vibe about the system we live in being corrupt and full of problems but there is alot of personal tracks in there as well about him dealing with his own emotions and fame. The other songs, like Little Susie and the covers round out it to an album full of variety. Michaels vocals are soft, gritty, angered, childish, or smooth depending on the track. This album showcases a wide vocal range and the diverse song writing ability Michael had. I've heard people pass this album off as \\"Michael trying to be godly or preach to people\\". Those same people might as well write off John Lennon's songs \\"Imagine\\", \\"Power to the People\\", and \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". Beyond any message the album had, the quality of the music is incredibly high and everything is very well done. Michael is just a target that people and the media insulted, so instead of saying how amazing his composition and lyrics are, they just say he is \\"a preacher\\". Never do either of the artists music tell people what to do, but they just make people think about the ideas being presented to them. In my opinion HIStory is Michael's best effort since Thriller and they both are tied for my favorite Jackson album.cussing his own issues and reasons of not being able to forget his Childhood. The song is very well done, very haunting, has a brilliant falsetto and the orchestration takes it to a new level. \\"Before you judge me, try hard to love me\\"<br /><br />Tabloid Junkie - Very quick, catchy song about the news \\"its slander \\" \\"tortures me \\" \\"parasite in black and white who would do anything for views\\".<br /><br />2 Bad - Urban hop hop track that contains a nice rap from Shaq.

B003IB38UM|5.0|The deluxe version has wonderful videos, particularly Abba's Switzerland concert.  The delivery was also extremely quick and painless.  The extras on the DVD were also great even for folks who aleady own prior versions of the Voulez-Vous album.
B0086700CM|4.0|I've consistently heard about the addiction powers of this game. Now that I've tried it I can honestly say I now understand what all the fuss was about.
B000FC13Y0|4.0|Great till the end.  There it lacked that “magic\\".<br />Would still advise anyone who watched the film to read it.
B0090SVDO0|5.0|It says this isnt a greatest hits  show but it sure seems like it if you like the doors youll love this I do anyway but thats just me texas radio and the big beat!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I don't mind the ads in the free version. This game is a lot of fun. You wont be sorry you downloaded it.
0756655307|5.0|It met all my expectations , very good quality!!<br />is what every fan must have ! ! ! ! !
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan is at the top of her game!  She has given new life to some of the greatest songs from Broadway/Stage and made them better!  As always, she infuses her music with great emotion and feeling!  This is not the first collection of musical scores to be covered on an album, but from where I stand, it is one of the best!  Way to go Susan.  You keep improving, and we are hopeful that your career continues so that we can enjoy your voice for years to come!
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Great story, star-studded. An excellant epic movie! Had to have it for my collection. A must own for any western movie buff!
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I am still reading, but have finished the first book within these chronicles. Looks good on the Kindle and it is a fun read. What I like best is the writing, Anne Rice is so descriptive, you feel that you are right there no matter if it is the 1700s or more recent, you can see, hear, smell and feel the place and what is happening.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan has once again out done herself with this album. I have loved her since the beginning & have all 4 of her albums. Love the duets she does on this album as well as all the other great songs.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|After reading the author's comments on the film, I appreciated the book even more.<br />Its beautifully written and, honestly, more exciting than the film because the situations and the characters are more fleshed out, so to speak.<br />Both are great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a fun game but the update came for everything else but this which stinks I really think mojang should pay attention to stuff like this
1469984202|5.0|I picked this book because of the ratings and the description that caught my attention.  I had high expectations of this book and it was met and exceeded.  It took me a few nights to finish this, about 2hrs/night cuz I am so busy like everyone else.  It was so hard not to think about this, literally all day.  I felt like I was in the silo watching the characters and wondering what would happen next.  It was so hard to detach and concentrate on my own daily activities.  This is the kind of book worth reading, worth my precious time.  Thanks Hugh Howey for taking me on such an unforgetable journey.  Hats off to you!
B0031RS2HC|3.0|While not overly complex the plot had enough twists and turns to maintain ones attention. Most of the characters came off as a little one dimensional but this didn't seriously detract from my enjoyment of the book. The \\"romance\\" side of the story was an area where it was frankly unbelievable - *spoiler* - it was pretty obvious that there was not going to be a relationship after the mystery was solved and everyone was safe.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|The review from Empire Magazine's Ian Nathan says it all, \\"Buffeted by a lack of suspense, threadbare characters, and a very poor script, the stunning visuals, gloopy madness, and sterling Fassbenderiness can't prevent Prometheus feeling like Alien's poor relation\\".
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Expect much to be written about all the glorious extra features in the 50th Anniversary Collector's edition.  The package is beautiful, the supplementary materials fascinating.  I merely wish to note that as, a home theater fanatic who has adopted today's wonderful new high definition front projection technology as my means for enjoying such films as this David Lean classic, the new Blu Ray restoration of the film is a dream come true.  The film was one that I saw in New York City during its opening run.  The pristine 70mm print, shown with the cutting edge projection and sound technology of that time, on a truly massive screen, left you feeling, for decades thereafter, that you would never experience the movie that way again.  In big screen projection, this new edition now makes it possible to come so close to the quality of that glorious first encounter, that one feels no need to ever improve on what has been accomplished here.  The elimination of dirt and scratches, the magnificent sharpness of the screen images, the vibrance of the color, the richness and clarity of the soundtrack combine to make a viewing experience that will be a joy to any serious fan of this picture.  I will not undertake to try and add any commentary on the film itself.  To many younger audiences of today, accustomed to the break-neck pace of contemporary action/thriller fare, the movie may simply seem too slow for their tastes.  Perhaps in vain, I would implore them to have patience and surrender to its thought-provoking depth and power; however, for those of us who are attuned to the style of great productions from the era of David Lean's heyday, there should be no need to recommend \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".  It gorgeously takes its epic genre to a level of intelligence and maturity that was never surpassed.
B008S80OU2|5.0|Let me comment on other comments.<br />First, yes we are all having to buy remastered albums that we already own.  However, if you figure that we are paying about $100 for the albums yet to be released remastered alone, that would come to a bit over $12 each, a great bargain.  Yes, we wanted extra tracks or accompanying DVDs, but still, we have them.  Thankfully, BOC is not following the King Crimson trend, releasing SLIGHTLY new versions.<br />Second, the download link is now working.  The rarities and broadcasts are not so amazing to us who have been collecting live shows for years, but we now have the official releases of &#34;Wings of Mercury&#34; and &#34;It Ain't Easy&#34;, among others.  Also, we get the studio version of  &#34;Buck's Boogie&#34; (previously only available from Buck, himself) and some tracks the guys had lain for the &#34;Teachers&#34; soundtrack. The rest and the downloads are shows that many of us have already found by other means, but it is nice to have them officially.<br />Third, Imaginos, Ninja, Revolution and Mirrors are great albums, they just aren't given the respect they deserve because they are compared to other BOC albums, not contemporary albums.  How many better albums were there in 1979 than &#34;Mirrors&#34;?  Same for 1989 albums and &#34;Imaginos&#34;.  You can't compare them to 'Secret Treaties&#34; since it might be one of the greatest of all times.  I will admit that, especially after speaking with Joe, that &#34;Imaginos&#34; was largely outsourced, but it is still a good album; give it a relisten as a concept album, the first recognized by the band (I know that others are themed).<br />In a nutshell, if you are a fan, you need this for the reissues, if you want the entire catalog, you need this.  I really can't comprehend a BOC demographic that wouldn't want this.  That being stated, Columbia might release all of those other albums individually next year, with bonus tracks and the &#34;On Your Feet...&#34; disc with thePizza Parlor video footage (if it exists) or the &#34;ETL&#34; disc with the Black and Blue footage.  But if they don't...

B009KS4XRO|1.0|The Bingo app is supposed to be free. However after I used up the credits that came with the game it wants to charge me to continue to play. How is that free?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Interesting book. Caught myself not being able to put it down it really grabs your attention. The fifty shades is what interested me the most. Not the ana character shes quite frustrating.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was one of the best I've read in a while! I wish there were more books...that is how much I enjoyed reading this series!!! This book let's you get lost in love, lust, and sexual fantasy! It has everything you could want all wrapped up in 3 amazing books! Christian and Ana!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I remember the exact day and time when I heard about JFK's assasination. Third grade class with Mrs. McElroy, Brookdale Elementary, Verona, NJ. Sitting in my chair, Mrs. McElroy left the room for several minutes. We all knew something grave had happened. When she came back she told us about the shooting in Dallas of our President John F. Kennedy. Everything stopped then, for me.<br /><br />When I read that Steven King had written a book about Oswald and November 22nd, '63, I was so intrigued. I've not finished it yet, but can say that it is so powerful, creative, and compelling. I cannot wait to finish it. It brings back so much memory of the early sixties when I was young. The time for me that was so innocent, but really was not- I was just so young and believed that the world was so good and life was wonderful and held so much potential.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|All in all a good book ! Story line a little slow at times but another Jack Reacher comes through in the end.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Perfect, especially written by a high profile doctor.  I enjoyed the book from start to finish.  I am 68 and have read many books on dying as I was very close a few years back.  I have no doubt about life after death.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham's best story yet! This has to be hands down favorite Grisham book. Story kept me interested all the way through, unlike his other books.
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|After hours with this product, I returned it because I could not properly balance my GH1 on it. I have spoken with other filmmakers that have said that this product works fantastically well.<br /><br />What I think is the key to using this stabilizer is that you will have to use your thumb or your hand somehow to keep it from losing balance. I think the product should be a little easier to balance in order for it to be truly useful.
B0086700CM|1.0|it says free and its in the free column but really it costs money! I thought I could get a game better than minecraft for free... but you CANT
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Nice app but does not adjust for the end of DST, only displays your current time on all locations or DST not CST for each location.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I usually can't put a book down once I start reading. This was not the case with this book. I was disappointed. Not boring but not exciting...
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I don't like novels in this form.  It has multiple parts, with the \\"clever\\" author jumping from story to story.  I found several sections boring.  It was disjointed and confusing.  If you like being bored, confused, and wasting your time, this novel is for you.  Did I mention that I hated it?
B000GFLAI0|1.0|already \\"Love and Theft\\" was more of theft than love. How many shillings may he have payed the family of Chuck Berry??? Obviously, some like to to listen to their master's voice (authoritarian characters). Sorry, what Jagger said in a different context applies surely to Dylan: Can't sing, can't play!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|A very nice Film version of a Legend's Story which contains some actual event recordings. Recommend viewing by interested Racehorse fans.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Thank you so much. This came as expected and very quick unexpectedly. I am very happy with my purchase and recommend to future buyers.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|GREAT case...would be AWESOMELY great if the stand worked both ways not just horizontal!<br />I like the strap and it is a decent case.

B00004XQP4|5.0|Ever since this album first came out, I was told by fellow Green Day fans that it was terrible and to avoid it at all costs and a lot of people still hold that mentality to this day so I never got around to buying this album. WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE! I don't understand why people said Green Day sold out with this and later albums, this sounds like musical evolution of a band who were getting older and wanted to get outside of the box.<br />\\"Warning\\" doesn't completely lose the distorted guitar or fast paced songs, some of that is on here but what it does do is allow the band to experiment more with different styles of music and they do it extremely well (while not going too far off the experimental deep-end). The band's songs have always been catchy and with some of the songs on here either having less crunch or slower pace, maybe longtime fans assumed that they were trying to cater to the mainstream more but I really don't see that here. This almost matches \\"Nimrod\\" as a whole in my opinion, sometimes it even surpasses it musically. For people who disregarded this and actually told me not to buy it, I can only assume that they wanted the band to continue to use their normal formula again but if Green Day hadn't changed, they would've started to sound old and irrelevant.<br />This was a step in the right direction, I haven't heard all of \\"American Idiot\\" but from what I've heard of it, that sounds decent too (another album that I was \\"warned\\" pun intended to steer clear of).<br /><br />If you're a fan of Green Day and slept on this album forever like I did because of what everyone else said, do yourself a favor and pick this up and appreciate it for what it is.<br /><br />If you like catchy rock music in general, there's a chance that there's something here for you but you should probably take a listen to either \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Nimrod\\" first to decide if you like the band.<br /><br />Hope this helped.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|All I have to say is, this is worth every penny! It's cheap and has all the best features. It's excellent, my boyfriend loved it!
B008K5T5AI|4.0|A good reading for any fan of the Culture novels, but this one does not rise to the heights some of the previous ones have. For Example, Surface Detail, in my opinion, has more depth, and Consider Phlebas more compelling story line. This one reminds me of Surface Detail both in the level of sentences and in the way the plot is woven - sentences are sometimes fairly complex, and several stories go side by side to come together as the novel progresses. Would I recommend this? Yes. Would I recommend some other Culture novels over this? Also yes, most of them (have not read Inversions and Matter).
B003P9VZ0W|3.0|See castle for reasons.  These are adorable and my granddaughter loves them in her room however they are curling and peeling off.  Had to clue them to get them to stick which means that they won't be transferrable if the need arises.
B0086449YA|5.0|Amazing !.. More than my expectation. A double - cd album ..Very beautiful music and sound  with  lyrics written inside..<br />Special  Mark Knopfler - Dire Straits,  music & guitar style..  New-melodies / new songs.. Both, electric -acoustic  guitar  sounds. Wonderful !!...
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I was first introduced to Gillian Flynn when I read \\"Gone Girl\\". At the time, I felt that she is an author that I probably would NOT like to have dinner with. Her characters were so dark, so real, so utterly corrupt that I had to wonder from what depths Flynn drew upon to create them. A quick handshake? Maybe. Certainly not dinner. I loved that book. The main characters in \\"Sharp Objects\\" make Hannibal Lecter look like Elmer Fudd. The sheer enormity of the psychosis fueled violence and sub-human depravity assaults the reader like a jack hammer. What a wild ride! If you like novels that crawl under your skin and worm their way into your soul, read this book.

0140135154|5.0|This is the Berger classic that will never cease fascinating most readers.  It came before more popular meditations on photography by Sontag and others, but for me this book remains the essential text for how we perceive the world around us through the art we interact with especially.
0307592731|2.0|I finished Wild on the Kindle a few days ago. It felt like a long story you might read in Reader's Digest, but I wanted to find out what happened, so I persisted. Really dull writing. Seems like she is attempting to be an Eat, Pray, Love look-alike: a real journey, an inner journey, plenty of suffering and gradual epiphanies, a penchant to rely on romance/attention from men for validation. Overall, pretty unimaginative, but things turned out well for her and that's satisfying.
B0036SSZIC|5.0|If you're not a member of the very elite rich, this movie should absolutely appeal to you.  Watch it, not as a member of any certain political party, but as just one of the American majority struggling to make it in a system designed against them.  Excellent movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is excellent!  I started watching because it was filmed less than a mile from my house.  I actually started near the end of Season 2.  I watched about 4 episodes with some friends then went home and the next day started at the very beginning to see what I had missed.  This show definetly deserves 5 stars! Give it a shot- you WON'T be disappointed!

B001RMYWG8|5.0|This movie was raw and gritty and was based on a true story. What else can i say.Watched it twice.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|My kids believe this movie helped teach them to &#34;never judge Anything or Anyone&#34; based on looks, or preconceived ideas of what is &#34;Alive&#34; or not.
1451695195|5.0|Having lost my 36 yr old daughter to a brain tumor in September, I have been searching for proof of life after death. This book confirmed my belief in heaven. Especially with the author being a man of science,not a man of the cloth, made it real to me. I also liked the website he mentions...it was helpful to me. I loved that his family members stayed with him through his illness. I liked everything about the book...wish I could meet Eben some day. I was able to get this book in my hands quickly after it was released.

B0090YHSFC|2.0|its mostly just a lot of waiting around for the perfect slice then hoping the game actually caught the whole motion.  if you like watching ice melt then this is for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great app!  Everyone in the whole entireworld should get it and I hope they update it for android soon!

B008MG1E4A|3.0|Good story, but everything is repeated over and over.  Almost sounded like the author was whining at times. Love the work the SEALS do, but author is a SEAL not a writer.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play it at work during my break i play at home I play it a lot omg love it I hate that you have to pay for hints im not buying so yeah lol it a waste of money lol anyways I love this game so fun :-)
159562015X|5.0|I loved this book.  I found out what my strengths were but then I bought a book for each of my team members and we are using it as a way to understand each others strengths.  It has been a great experience so far.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
0345803493|5.0|The author does a great job in create real characters with real personalities that I can relate to. The author writes as if the characters are in front of your eyes in real life. I enjoyed the book tremendously and will immediately purchase the 3rd book.
B009B0CZXU|5.0|After watching 2 music videos from this album Laura & All your gold I waited until this album is available on Amazon.com to download, it's very good, my personal is 'oh yeah', marilyn,other tracks including laura, which reminds me of one of the song by peter gabriel), Natasha is very talent and did a very well done job on her works. I love all 3 of her albums cuz it has creativity, deep lyrics, and wonderful sounds/beats. well done natasha!
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Thank you for asking for my feedback.  The Beatles are one of my favorite bands of all time and I love their music!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I am so depressed when I read a book that wastes my time.  I love a book that moves.  This book was slow, the police missed clues even I could have figured out, and the ending was just plain stupid.  Maybe I'm supposed to like a book I have to think about.  NO!  I read because I love stories.  This one was a real waste of my time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was such a gripping story from beginning to end! I've recommended this book to many friends and family members!

B008YWY0HK|3.0|The early trailers for this film convinced you that this was going to be an epic and magical adventure (with some whimsical humor) that the geniuses at Pixar were going to take you on--a redemption of Cars 2 of the previous year. As time went on, I began to see newer trailers/tv spots for the film, that left me in question.<br />Why are they marketing this as a down-right comedy now?<br />What's with the bear cub and the boobs thing?<br />Has Pixar lost their minds?<br /><br />I saw the movie in theaters. I went in alone (as a film critic), still with very high expectations for the film despite the recent questionable advertisements it had.<br /><br />The film starts out with Merida (the main character) as a little girl. It's her birthday, she gets a bow from her father as a gift. Little Merida goes into the forest to find her lost arrow, and finds what they call \\"wisps\\". She retrieves her lost arrow, and goes back to tell her parent what she saw,  and then her party gets crashed by a 15 foot monster bear. You'd think all of these things would connect later in the movie or help along the plot... but no. Seriously, this opening sequence has nothing to do with what the film is really about.<br /><br />Turns out that Merida's mother arranged for her to get married, and the suitors are on their way. Merida doesn't want to get married, and tries to break tradition in her own way, and runs away to find a witch in the forest who gives her a cake that changes her mother into a bear. And because the spell didn't do what she wanted, Merida is trying to get a refund. That's it.<br /><br />Really there's no need for the movie to be called \\"Brave\\" since there were no achievements in bravery in this film. I personally though that \\"Rebel\\" would've been a better title since it was basically all about Merida's rebellion against her mother, family, and cultural traditions. And they for some reason throw the 15 foot bear back into the movie, as well as comic nudity (which I found to be more on Dreamworks' level) and a \\"hilarious\\" moment where the bear cub lands in a heavy-set servant woman's boobs (which I found had Disney written all over it).<br /><br />Basically, the animation was beautiful, but the story was a mess. They had too many ideas for the story and it felt like they wanted to please all the story writers so they shoved everything in. This is sad because at one time, Pixar prided themselves on story. Everyone knows if a film doesn't have a good story, it's not going to be good. There are so many examples of that courtesy of Dreamworks Animation (Shrek the Third, Bee Movie, Madagascar 1).<br /><br />I really wanted Brave to be my new favorite Pixar movie, but it came up short. Just like Cars 2, I enjoyed the Pixar animated short film more than the actual feature film. I will buy Brave on DVD in due time, (since I am a hardcore Pixar fan, and I own every movie), but like Cars 2 (which I also have on DVD) I will rarely watch it.<br /><br />Disney has very much taken over Pixar, and it's really starting to show ever since Cars 2. Let's hope that the Monster Inc prequel (Monsters University) doesn't disappoint.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|great educational video, was looking for something that the mainstream media doesn't cover.  the video has helped me to make some changes for the positive.  I would recommend watching it again to refresh
B0063IH60K|4.0|Decent app that plays the classic game without much fuss.  Runs smoothly on my Fire and doesn't have too many annoying ads.  All in all, a fairly decent time-waster.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This movie has entered contemporary culture and is likely to remain. It has classic elements of action, adventure,  romance, with the over-arching theme of Good-vs-Evil.  And it's technologically brilliant. It works on *so* many levels.
0312330529|5.0|This book is now one of my favorites of all time. There were lots of thought provoking conversations and  I felt immersed in the Indian culture. The story carried me non-stop to its conclusion where I was sad to see the book end.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Neat concept, well imagined!  We thoroughly enjoyed it.  Far more exciting than any history lesson *I* remember!  Can't wait for the sequel, \\"Ronald Reagan, Werewolf\\"
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As a Grisham addict, I was not dissapointed.  THis would make a great who-done-it movie.  Go out and buy it, you wonn't be dissapointed.
B009DZDJU6|5.0|Even if your not big into U.S. History the plot is so dang cool because it brings into play historical events to create a cool vampire plot and even cooler American President Hero!!! loved this movie.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I went into king animal extremely excited, but I guess I was expecting them to lean heavily on the past. Instead they have released the best rock album i've heard in 10 years. This is more of an evolution to Upside, and its incredible. Its Soundgarden, but matured. If you havent bought this album do yourself a favor.
B006LSZECO|3.0|No one in this novel is in touch with reality.  The two main characters are miserable human beings.  At the end of the book I completely disliked both of them.  The title characters' parents are people who have been unable to see the light of day for decades.  I would say these horrible folks deserve each other, but no, she deserves worse.  The husband is a nightmare human being with a facade of likeability but can't be a grown up and has many, many excuses for his personality flaws.  The wife, who is the gone girl, never had any socially redeeming qualities to start with.  Yes it's well written but nothing explains why so many of the characters, while presented as intelligent, are so lacking in common sense and common decency.  When I really enjoy a book I will re-read it so as to experience any nuances that I missed the first time.  Not this one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once you start reading these it is impossible to stop. I read all three in 4 days. I am a very busy person so this put me very behind on everything else.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|What's not to love?  Rufus did it again with a great album full of stories, images and wonderful music.  Bought enough copies for all of us!  A very good album by a wonderful musician.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Great epic music. I listen to a lot of epic music and this is one of the best. The slow and delicate passages are emotional and very sad (which I dig) and the bombastic moments are exciting! I highly recommend it.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|I have read better, not his best work,  but I will still read David Baldacci book most are very good
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I normally love DeMille books, but this one just dragged on forever, with nothing but Corey humor.  Not up to Nelson quality.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I usually do not buy novels, but with the power outage from Sandy I wanted a good Grisham novel, as substitute TV.  I was not disappointed and very grateful for his skill at interesting twisted plots that concern the legal system.  I am not the romance novel type, so I enjoyed the realism and the adventure and the unexpected twists and turns.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Great app. but always seems to be a version behind what is available on Google play store. Please update it to keep in synch with the play store version.
B009APMNB0|5.0|Bought this to replace an old huey pro monitor calibrator. The huey worked well, but it used suction cups to hold it to the screen and they were lousy suction cups, so I had to moisten them to get them to stick which left marks on the monitor that I had to clean up. No such problems with the ColorMunki Smile. The huey also was willing to adjust the monitor for ambient light (bad idea for photographers), which I didn't use. The ColorMunki Smile uses a lot more calibration points (haven't counted, but it's at least 3 times as many, maybe 4), but the results are pretty consistent with those obtained from the huey.<br /><br />Using this product is dead easy. You just start the software, hang the device over the monitor, press go and wait a few minutes. You get to click a before/after button if you want to when it's done, but otherwise there is nothing for the end user to do. I'm pretty picky, but I can't think of a single thing to complain about with this product. It just does its thing and does it well. Doesn't have a lot of wizz bang features, but I bought it to calibrate my monitor and that's what it does, and it does it with no fuss whatsoever. It doesn't do anything else, but I don't want it to do anything else. Excellent product.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was one of those books that kept me coming back....I didn't want to put it down.  But when I did have to, I was eager to find out what was going to happen next.

B001LMU182|4.0|\\"AKIRA\\", the 1988 anime film that became the masterpiece of mangaka and director Katsuhiro Otomo.<br /><br />My first viewing of \\"AKIRA\\" was back in 1993. I have to be truthful, it was one of those films that I had to watch several times because I felt I was missing something integral. Each time I watched the film, there was always something new that I picked up and for anyone who has seen this animated film, just how much was put into the animation, the detail for an animated film.<br /><br />In 1988, Disney had \\"Oliver & Friends\\" and being touted as the first animation to utilize hand drawn art and computerized graphics and as the film incorporated some darkness that may scare the kiddies, in Japan, \\"AKIRA\\" was a film that would set records in the Summer and eventually get a limited release in theaters.<br /><br />The film would surprise and shock people because this was not a children's animation, this was geared for adults. And did it look awesome at that time!

B0085RQLXK|4.0|I used to buy the Aerosmith albums blind. It won't happen anymore. Album is OK, but Carrie Underwood..... is a statement and disrespect to the fan base who keeps buying their albums through decades. If I knew about it I would never buy the album. I bought vinyl and CD. I believe there's no problem with duets and the song is fine, but there are plenty of great singers on the market with artistic individuality presence, yet they got this talent-less money making machine. Even my wife who really liked the album otherwise admits that it's bad singing. I did not want to write the review because I do not want it to be negative. There are some great moments on the record, but anticipation of the song with Underwood for now is strong and just ruining the experience. Guess how many people did not buy the album for the same reason. What's next? AC/DC with Justin Bieber?
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This book currently has me laughing out loud! Not sure if I'm supposed to be, but I am! It is dry and funny, witty and clever and really makes me want to be a centenarian so I can get myself in some seriously hilarious trouble one of these days!! Not done yet, but I can't wait to curl up and finish it off - but I really don't want the adventure to end, I love these characters.
1936608618|5.0|As a CrossFitter and CrossFit Endurance coach, this book is exactly what I needed. There is so much information out there, and when you go through your certifications, yes, you learn it, but you'll still find that you have some unanswered questions. This book is very inclusive, and I know that I'll be referring to it often as I feel that not only myself, but my clients will benefit from the information. It covers running, biking, rowing, swimming and mobility, and Brian Mackenzie brought on others to help with some of those sections, all notable people in their area of expertise. So far this book has been a very great refresher, and as a coach it's good to always keep up with the knowledge that it out there. Highly recommend this book!
B002WCLG3O|4.0|I love the HALO games, and this adds the the already rich universe. The animation is awesome and I would recommend this to anyone in love with the HALO universe!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This is a great movie / comedy for.the family or kids. Good story line good actors with a little bit of action. All in all not a bad.movie.
B007THA4FI|2.0|A lot of teen angst with an over abundant use of the f word. The hormone driven sex got annoying after a short time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The comic is great and the show does it justice. Although it strays a little from the comic(as you would expect) it is still doing a great job keeping to the story. One of the best shows on TV!
B008MM9630|5.0|it took me a little while to get into it.. I actually put it down for a few. days each time.. but I persevered. I love this game.. it is cute and time flies when I am playing.....glad I stuck with it.
B009OYTIXS|4.0|I've never got into CW shows, but I must say I'm enjoying this show.  The comic book theme is great.  What I'm liking about this show is that it is not trying to be anything its not.  It is a simple comic based action show, and that is what they are delivering.  I've been, so far, pleased with the acting.  The story line is great, and I like how they are revealing a little more about the island in each episode.  Also, the action scenes are surprisingly good.  The fight scenes are good as well.  They aren't Bourne quality, but for a show like this, they're pretty believable.  I'm definitely hooked on this show at the moment and will keep watching.<br />My only minor complaint is that I'm starting to like Oliver's sidekick more than him.  When the two of them are together, the actor playing the sidekick just seems to steal the scenes.  But that's really it.  The actor playing Oliver is a little dry, but he's not all that bad.  I think he's doing an ok job.<br />As far as being able to beat a bunch of machine gun toting badies with nothing more than a bow and arrow...that is called suspension of disbelief, and I am just fine with it.
B0090YHSFC|1.0|Great game if you want to encourage your child to love the sound of clinking ice cubes in an adult beverage. What were they thinking? And besides that as a game it's very arbitrary as to where it allows the ice to be cut. Cutting ice has to rank right up there with stacking firewood for entertainment value.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I am a big fan of songs that are sung in a different set of tone. Susan Boyle has taken songs and made each song into a new version of itself. It was the same when she had sung wild horses. I have never heard of the song before, until she had sang it. I youtube'd the original version and was surprised that I preferred Susan Boyle's version instead. I watched her auditions in Britain's Got Talent, and she actually should've won. But hey you can't win everything. We all might hate Simon Cowell, but he gave this opportunity to Susan Boyle. She took this opportunity and wow! Go Susan! You've won my heart!
B005LF9AOQ|5.0|My wife and I really love this show - we got caught up on Netflix, and needed to bridge the gap between Netflix's Season 6 and the current Season 8. We were able to watch this on my PS3, quality was great, Amazon player is easy to use. I love how easy it is to consume this show without hassling with shipping disks and keeping them around.
0316228532|3.0|So many people have attacked Rowling for \\"The Casual Vacancy,\\" but I don't believe they're entirely grounded in their accusations. People were expecting something with the genius and creativity of Harry Potter, and, no, this book doesn't have that. It is very dark and not as humorous as it was advertised to be. It is certainly not for children. However, it was never supposed to be Harry Potter, and if that's what people want, then they'll just have to stick with those seven volumes until Rowling decides to write more from the magical world.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy,\\" to me, is realistic. The social problems that Rowling brings to light through the plot are worldwide issues that need to be discussed. I am an American and I hear on the news every day incidents similar to those that drive the plot of this book, so it isn't just the English who have societal ills. While it isn't great literature, it's not the one-star book that so many disappointed Potter nuts are making it out to be.

B009VB97EY|4.0|I had been waiting to watch this film as soon as it was available. I enjoyed it. I wish there were more dance scenes and for me I could have done without the serious drug storyline. I had no idea. I guess I wanted it to be a little lighter
0316010669|4.0|I have read all the books of Malcolm Gladwell so far and  though this is not his best work but still the book has a lot of insights to give. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that sometimes it became a little vague otherwise a great book.
1846556007|4.0|It was great to finally read the very first Harry Hole mystery. But interestingly enough I felt like I didn't really learn anything new about him except the right way to pronounce \\"Hole.\\"  I found it interesting that Jo Nesbo put set the first book in the series in a country other than Oslo. I felt it took a long time for Nesbo to set everything up and get the story rolling but once he did it was typical Nesbo.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book is, by far, the best instructive manual I have ever read on the topic of non-verbal communication.  Joe Navarro's approach to the topic is both practical and entertaining.  Navarro was a Special Agent for the FBI and has so many stories that beautifully illustrate the points he makes around various non-verbal body cues.  I am in the field of sales and since reading this book, I have become acutely aware of my non-verbal cues, as well as, those of others.  I have been training others to also recognize signs of comfort and discomfort and I know that the learnings from this book have helped to close many more sales and build stronger relationships with customers.  I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to better connect and understand others.  It is incredible eye opening and transformational.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This album is true art.  It evokes a strong emotional response.  Susan is a true artist.  The top of my \\"bucket list\\" is to someday hear Susan sing in a live performance.  Even the songs that are well known take on a newness with Susan's rendition.  It doesn't get any better than this.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed these books. It brought back memories of what a great marriage should be. Also it was very HOT. It has everything, romance, mystery, charactors and a wonderful plot. When is the next trilogy.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I am Loving this app. I have used it everyday after downloading.  Love searching for friends to see what they like.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love that it tells me times left to charge/play on different things. ie..games, music, reading a book,  whatever I'm doing. love. that a lots! THANKS!!!!!
B008458O3S|5.0|My wife kept asking me - what are you doing or - are you playing that again?  I couldn't stop myself - my only hope is that I run out of levels or else its intervention time!
0345803485|3.0|Ok, where do I start? I know there are alot of bad reviews and I do agree with some of them. Yes, it gets annoying when she bites her lips 50 times in 1 chapter, the fact that she turns crimson every 30 seconds, the fact Grey constantly mentions he's rich and passes his hand threw his hair, the fact that she argues with her inner goddess like shes a psycho and the list goes on..yes, it can be repetitive, however, its a good book..not the best but good...it's basically a fairy tale that some if not most women will like to happen to them..for a beautiful billionaire to sweep them off their feet and take good care of them while keeping there independence..well Anastasia has that some what lol..yes, the sex scenes are funny but who doesn't need a laugh once in a while? Overall, its a book to keep your mind off of things for a while while you drift off into a fantasy island. I'm up to the second book of the trilogy and I'm looking forward to the third!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary is a clever and refreshing modernized take on Sherlock Holmes. People have said that it's too much like BBCs Sherlock, but I watch both shows, and while they are both modernized Sherlocks, other than that they don't really resemble each other. Each is great in its own way, and should be looked at, appreciated, and taken as entirely different, original shows instead of compared to each other. Elementary is definitely lighter and funnier than Sherlock, and Lucy Liu's Joan Watson is fantastic as Jonny Lee Miller's Sherlock's assistant. Highly recommended!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|it is challenging enough to keep me stimulated and yet easy enough to master. I love to watch the replay and watch again and again. Thank you concrete software! please make more lkke this!
B0047CGXHG|5.0|Box set arrived very quickly and in prestine condition. This series was fun to read and left me wanting to read the next series.
0062073486|5.0|Many times, when students have to read a book for school, it can be extremely stressful trying to finish by a certain date. However, this book was such a joy to read, every single person in my class finished early. I read And Then There Were None in 8th grade and have called it one of my favorite books for many years. It does such a fantastic job of creating suspense for the reader to feel that you will not even want to put it down. Every single chapter ends in a cliff hanger and the ending is just outstanding. Agatha Christie, I thank you so much for providing such a thrilling experience in such a short read. If you are debating whether or not to read this book, I would highly recommend that you do!
B009GIPDQS|4.0|John Grisham really knows how to keep the reader guessing until the last minute.  There were so many twists to the plot I couldn't even guess where he was going.  He brought all the threads together very skilfully.  Well done!
0756686970|5.0|Over the years there have been a handful of special toys that my son has cherished and this book is one of them.  We bought it for him 4 months ago and I believe he has opened this book every single day since then.
1451648537|4.0|This biography gives us the full picture of Steve Jobs, good and bad.  It is a detailed history of Jobs, his life and his creations at Apple, NeXT, Pixar and Apple again.  And it's a look at the impatient frustrations of a perfectionist who, with the genius of vision and presentation, liked to distort reality, had poor people skills and thought no rules applied to him.<br /><br />I don't know what to think of Steve Jobs.  He derived his happiness from creating and was driven to do so.  He manipulated people, berated them, ignored his wife and children.  He regularly took credit for ideas that came from his creative team and rearranged facts to benefit his point, all with no regrets.  But time and again he enabled people to achieve the impossible by refusing to believe that something could not be done.<br /><br />AND...Steve Jobs gave us the Mac, fonts, graphics and desktop publishing.  He gave us the iPhone, the iPod, iTunes and music.  He allowed us to re-experience the feelings we used to have in record stores as we excitedly flipped through albums and heard new music on the store speakers.  Then he gave us the iPad, movies and books all with a touchscreen.  He knew what we wanted, just as he said, before we knew what we wanted.<br /><br />This was a very interesting read.  My only negative comment is that it was sometimes overly repetitive, particularly on the subjects of distorted reality and Jobs' belief in closed-end product design.  I also thought the author often portrayed Jobs as too much of a beloved hero in the second half of the book, once Jobs returned to Apple.  But then again, that's when we got all these great products.  And I don't think I could live without my iPod!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hooked on this game . i play it at least three times a day if my battery will let me lol. love it play it all the time

B0085A9HXS|5.0|The Raid blew my mind right from the start, after viewing the trailer. I had to see it, and once I did, my mind was officially blown. Action? Check. More action? Double check. Relevant story? We don't even need it, but there it is: check. Sewed up, believable ending? Check. Watching this movie is the best adrenaline rush you'll get from sitting still. I promise.
B0063IH60K|5.0|have had this app for a year and use it daily! only bummer is ads that pop up more and more often. as it is free, no real complaint.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I love this movie. It has just the right mixture of wit, sarcasm, teen angst, action sequences, rap and extraterrestrials. It's awesome!
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|i want to say to all those captain hooks out there this one is a keeper. i played for about 5 minutes when i realize i need to pay $2.99 for the full game. Execellent voice over, graphic are off the chain, and story is awesome. I got that out of the way. Story open where captain dies by his own doing. Now present day you working at the muesum and your daughter with you. You and daughter gets  ready for opening where errie things start happening the lights go off, ship appear, no captain...  Where is my daughter ?That the question you asked yourself.  Does she find her daughter in time and if you need know the answer you must play this fun fun fun game.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|My favorite of the trilogy!  I waited quite a while to get the first book - Fifty Shades of Gray - but finally had to see what all the hype was about.  I was hooked.  The second one was even better - more of a story to it.  After that I just had to have the third and I found a friend at work who read it at the same time.  We talked about the characters as if they were close friends - they seemed so real.  O.K., we are ready for our next adventure into the sex, love, violence and lifelike adventures of the next set of characters.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|DCD is one of my all time favorite bands.  I have several of their albums and this one was equally as beautiful.  It's a must buy for any DCD fan!
B00913DPW2|4.0|It's decent smart game.<br />My children like it so much.<br />Each level, it make me confuse but my children challenge and enjoy it.
1579129129|5.0|Great book. I learned a lot, and it is a great refference. If anybody wants to learn about skulls or animals it is a great book and I enjoy it very much.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I thought it was a great movie! Full of adventure & excitement. It was not meant to be taken seriously, but it would be as I would think Abe would have been had he been a vampire slayer.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Read it all in one day.  Gives a real insight into the lives of Afghan women.
B005EVVESM|5.0|A fab cd. The music is upbeat. I would recommend this cd highly. This is my second cd from this artist.
1401937268|5.0|I am amazed by the difference these cards make when I do a reading.  Having read traditional tarot cards since 1992, I have found the high vibrational energies and clear messages of these Angel cards help me, and the client, receive deeper meaning and understanding.  How cool is that!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have heard so many times that it's one of those books where either love it or you hate it. I LOVED this book! There are some repetitive phrases but if you are like me you will get so wrapped up in it that you hardly notice. Highly recommended!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I installed the 30 days trial and after about 2-3 days I was sold. I love this app, learns quickly and has a great layout. Word prediction is very accurate, I would guess 90+% of the time it get's it right. Well worth the $$$. No need to look elsewhere, this is the one and only KB app you need.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Many albums nowadays comprise of 2-3 good songs, and the other 10 songs are junk. However, every song on this album was awesome. Being a manly man, I am not ashamed of my love for Taylor Swift. Keep it up girl!
034580404X|5.0|This is a love story and a mystery.  I enjoyed how the characters were introduced and developed. Once I began reading the book I could not put it down.

B004I744AS|5.0|Super incredible. I try this product for last 4 months it's really helpful.  I recommend to use and works in Spanish and vice versa
B0083SBJXS|5.0|avengers is the best you must be stupid of you do not buy it funniest and most thrilling movie ever!!!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|One of my favorite books. Highly recommend whether you have kids or not. A very sweet and touching story. Louise May Alcott, by her own admission, can be a bit melodramatic, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the story.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Thought it was a good movie, not perfect but kept me entertained.<br /><br />Comes with both Blu-Ray and DVD, which should be standard for all the bigger movie releases.<br /><br />Arrived in perfect condition and being that it took a month (due to military deployment) that's really good.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Great book, great love story. If you have seen the classic movie with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon you won't recognize much of it in this. I love the movie, too, but kind of think it as mostly a different story.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Thought it was a good movie, not perfect but kept me entertained.<br /><br />Comes with both Blu-Ray and DVD, which should be standard for all the bigger movie releases.<br /><br />Arrived in perfect condition and being that it took a month (due to military deployment) that's really good.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I absolutely tore through the 1st two books. The story was fascinating, twists and turns abounded. I couldn't put it down. The 3rd book I struggled with (and I am a quick reader). This book I never made it all the way through. I keep thinking I will finish it, but its been months and I haven't even tried. If he would write more about the characters I am already interested in, instead of rehashing stories already told and introducing even more new characters, than I would have probably torn through it already. So disappointed. I really do love this series, feel for the characters, and want to know what happens!! I have enjoyed the HBO series so far. Here's to hoping the next book is better....
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Good song, not much else to say.<br /><br />Might not be for everyone but who cares as long as you like it...right?
B0049P1N3K|4.0|The book is written in a simple language and very interesting to read to the end. I understood life better and why things happen the way they do. It also tells specifically how to change way of thinking into positive which made my life way better. I am calmer and more aware of my moods. I recommend the book highly.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Classic Beatles, all tracks sound great and an overall great purchase.<br /><br />Arrived in perfect condition and being that it took a month (due to military deployment) that's really good.
0316228532|4.0|I loved this book. I was thrown by the completely drastic style change of the H.P. writer I love, but as I got into the book, I felt torn. After every chapter, especially towards the middle on, I wanted to read more, but at the same time, I saw the downward spiral this book was taking and didn't want to face the pain that was inevitable. The characters are real. They are flawed and you see that honesty behind them that people hide from everyone else in their lives and to an extent, even from themselves.<br /><br />I feel like I had an unfair connection because, I grew up in this town. Obviously not THIS town, but I grew up in a small town with a poverty side and a \\"snob side\\" and I think she nailed the small town mindset of people. I'm conflicted between my views of my old town now. I grew up poor and from that point of view, everything was so nice outside my lifestyle that my main goal as a child was to get all those amenities and experiences I could never have. I didn't want to just perpetuate the impoverished lives of my family, and I did, in fact, succeed at becoming successful and it allows me to live in the nice area of town. My realization I had is, I'm not Barry. Barry looked back and he saw a chance to help others do what he did. I selfishly look back and try my best to get as far away from that life as I possibly can, for fear of being pulled back in.<br /><br />The fact that a book can make me aware of opinions I didn't realize I had, makes this a favorite for me. I'm not a writer and I don't pretend to be, but I wish I could hire one to express just how accurate this book is compared to my childhood. How easily I can comprehend the characters' reactions and emotions; Their secrets and their rationalizations. How much insight it has given me into people I know and knew. If you haven't read it, I definitely think you should. If he have read it, and you didn't like it or didn't get it, then maybe that's a good thing for you.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Opened my eyes to better understand how my actions and decisions impact environment. Changed my buying habit. Only organic from now on
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I had already seen The Avengers and all of the prequels of the individual superheroes and The Avengers was beyond my best expectations.  Marvel is on a roll.  Highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys true escapism!!
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|I have to say that last year's set was a much bigger hit with the kids.  The figures this year...not that exciting.  The price....ridiculous!!!  Lego prices are getting out of control!
0061906220|5.0|This is a great book. My son is 4 and they read this book to him and his classmates at preschool and ALL the kids love this book! They all get involved and have huge smiles on their faces. I think this book teaches young kids how to problem solve when they are in a pickle.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Got this for a gift - looks very cute and the gems included were a nice surprise!! Hoping they are truly removeable and moveable as stated.  Will find out if Mom is upset if they don't!!  Worth the $ assuming they do remove and move nicely.
B0090YHSFC|1.0|Diplo is great and all but this mix is pretty amateur. I like the song selection but the mixing is mediocre at best. He knows music better then I do but I know enough to tell when someone is just throwing something together,
B000005RQT|5.0|great album, good to revisit. bonus tracks were a revelation, demo versions of some of the album tracks etc. really happy with my purchase.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|This is really one of the best seasons for real. I only need season 3 and 4 to complete my collection. I even buy the new ones (season 8)direct from Amazon to my computer each week.

B003L77GGK|4.0|Im so glad I bought this season. It catches me up to the current season (8) and makes it easier to know whats going on. I love every season, of course, but im glad i got this. Amazon is definately the place to buy complete seasons of your favorite TV shows. They got Walmart beat on their prices by at least 50%. Plus as a bonus I dont have to go to that awful store.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|I had hoped that by now, Apple could have finally released a definitive vinyl version of these classic albums. Sadly, they have not done so. They should have done an all-analog remastering, but barring that, they should have used HiRez digital files for the vinyl cutting. They did not. Having said that, these sound decent, and would serve anyone without access to original Parlophones, etc with reasonable LPs of some of the best music ever recorded. However, Rainbo was chosen by Captiol/Apple to press these in the USA and that is unfortunate. There are countless reports of defective pressings: My Rubber Soul from the box is unlistenable, Abbey Road likewise. Others are ok, and I still have a few more to evaluate. Will update when totally through the box. I know Amazon will efficiently replace my defective box, but to what end? To find more defectives in the replacement set? I may return these and order the box from the UK where it seems the pressings are much higher quality, though even there, it appears that many people are complaining about warped discs. Too bad. The Beatles, and their fans, deserve better.<br /><br />So:<br />A million stars for the music.<br />FOUR stars for the sonics, not bad, but not as good as it should have been.<br />TWO stars for QC of these awful Rainbo USA pressings.<br /><br />If you purchase this box, make sure you evaluate all the discs before your 30-day return period elapses. YMMV.
B003YOMN68|5.0|Any purchaser of this recording needs to be forewarned that the miraculous music it contains will require more attentive (and repeated) listening than many in attendance at the Vanguard on June 25, 1961 were prepared to give it.  Their chatter paradoxically serves as a \\"foil\\" to the beauty occurring merely  feet away from them as well as a reminder of the difficulty the public has devoting attention to a moment of beauty perhaps rivaled by few others in an entire lifetime. We know there would have been no such disregard of the offerings of the artist had Keith been playing.  He would have chastized the crowd, offenders and adoring fans alike, and commanded absolute silence before performing music far more accessible, labored, and ordinary than anything you will hear on this recording from half a century ago.<br /><br />Comparison-contrast can be a revelatory learning tool--one that, given prevailing assumptions about time and progress, frequently subverts our own expectation.  Comparing the predecessor's performance of \\"I Loves You Porgy\\" and \\"My Foolish Heart\\" on this recording with the successor's (easily accomplished in an iTunes program or on the youtube site) is to come around to a full and conclusive understanding of not merely the \\"influence\\" of seminal genius but of the very essence of creative genius. And if more evidence is required, the successor seems almost too eager to oblige (comparing the two pianists' performances, as posted on youtube, of \\"Stella by Starlight\\" and \\"All of You\\" is equally awakening).<br /><br />The differences must be noted at the conceptual, wholly musical, level as well as the technical, \\"pianistic\\" one.  In terms of the latter, Bill's shoulder power, arm leveraging, hand positioning (those enormous hands--and thick fingers!) provide visual support to what the ear is hearing.  The sonorities of the piano practically \\"sing\\" by themselves (without aid of the player's vocalizations) while the tones from the left hand match the richness and complex textures of the right hand, together creating a \\"chordal\\" voice that the successor's single-note lines and occasional \\"pushing\\" at the keys with the left hand are incapable of duplicating.<br /><br />Musically, the differences are no less revealing.  Bill's attention to outer as well as inner voices assures a sense of continual, purposeful movement toward a musical end, at once validating the artist's creations and the composer's original structure.  The performer is open to momentary inspirations, to ideas that will result in added energy and surprise, but without any deviations from a purposeful result. There are no digressions, no melodic-harmonic \\"impositions\\" or side-trips, no wasted notes.  And the player's \\"very humility\\" opens this sacred musical space to contributions from the bassist that verge on the telepathic in their momentary precision and \\"rightness.\\"  At every instant the music is alive and dynamic, exhibiting not the ego of any single player but the extemporaneous, living, creative product of \\"grace under pressure.\\"  Tension and movement are present at each instant even as an adherence to the bold outline of the original structure assures the listener of his or her shared place in the music (and admittedly \\"licenses\\" others to engage in conversation, especially since, rather than call for the audience's undivided attention, these artists necessarily dismiss all traces of ego as a prerequisite to taking the bandstand).<br /><br />By contrast, the music of the successor falls short.  It's deliberative, intentionally \\"different,\\" and always \\"accessible\\" (deliberately anti-tonal one moment, and plain and folksy, the next.  It meanders with a single-minded, determined and self-driven motivation that destroys the integrity of the original composition, sacrificing it to the \\"artist's\\" pre-emptive claim to the helpless listener's attention.  The artist is no longer the humble servant of the music (quite the opposite), with its enormous potential for the subtle and complex expressions of human emotion, awaiting only the \\"key\\" to what Tennyson called \\"the Palace of Art.\\"  Bill Evans and Scott LaFaro gain access to that place/palace (Coleridge's \\"Xanadu\\"), leaving the door open for anyone to follow. But those unwilling to check their egos at the door need not bother.<br /><br />This music simply remains unchallenged if not unapproached--especially by musicians of lesser gifts and greater egos.  Reflect for a moment: we  don't witness a Shakespeare play or even read a Shakespeare sonnet to admire its creator.  Faulkner's works are made no truer, no more significant because of our attention to the author's talents or personal feelings.  The genius is in the work's lodging in our consciousness and forever playing itself out as part of our own experience. The \\"great creators\\" are those who, according to the Romantic poet John Keats, possess \\"negative capability.\\"  In the face of personal tragedies, misfortunes, self-disrepair, and life's challenges and changes, the great ones like Shakespeare, Faulkner and Keats create art that's capable of capturing and representing the manifold complexities, subtleties, ironies, paradoxes of human existence in a form that, like the prototypal creation of Genesis, forever attracts us by its wholeness and beauty.  The art of the great creators survives them and us--as lasting testimony to the wonders an ever-vital, inexhaustible world of actual human experience, a creation that resists all simplistic attempts to reduce it to something else, something lesser than the loudest, most insistent and didactic proclamations of a raging fundamentalist.  In the world of music, Bill Evans was one of the great ones.<br /><br />[I think I've got it.  Since writing the above I've continued to listen to Bill obsessively (excluding some of the wretched audio representations of his piano on a recent discovery as well as on many of his mid-career projects for Verve), looking ever more carefully and single-mindedly. Bill is, above all, an artist afraid of closure!  Death, finality, stasis--the man is repelled by such considerations.  Every note that he plays is pianistically \\"in motion\\"--at the merest suggestion of a cadence Bill will play an unexpected rapid figure in his right hand; he starts and stays with a trill in his left hand (unheard of in most jazz pianist's work); he plays ascending and descending moving octaves in major 9ths (a variation on the chromatic 2nds of his frequent chord clusters).  Never does he settle for a moment of \\"poignant, meditative\\" stasis or opt out for a disappointing because final \\"triad.\\"  The tension he forever employs (as I now listen again to the recordings from his final two weeks of life) is his way of announcing a new beginning: art, creativity, life must prevail, there must be more beginnings, as many as possible.<br /><br />The closest he came to closure was \\"Peace Piece\\" from a recording before Miles, \\"Kind of Blue,\\" and the Vanguard Sessions.  But attentive listening even to \\"Peace Piece\\" reveals a man who is not at peace onless it's something he can make happen, enacting preparations for a never realized finality again and again.  Finally, it would all culminate in the anticipatory phrasing of his last trio.  He abandons not merely conventional meter but alters the pulse, displacing the first beat on what would normally be considered a measure, while the left hand is relentlessly pushing him forward, never merely the frame of reference that it is for most one-handed players.  On comes Jimmy Van Heusen's \\"Like Someone in Love\\" and Bill lungee forward to the next measure before it's time for the tune's chords to appear.  There's a sensation of one phrase after the other suddenly appearing and being swatted away like a man in a cage taking batting practice, each phrase a fast-ball with greater acceleration than the previous one.  \\"Bring it on, but faster\\" he seems to say as he prepares to swat another one.  Suddenly LaBarbara's drum breaks come into play, the trills are now in the right hand, and the tension continues to mount, there's no choice but to ignore the bar lines and the usual up and down pulse, and instead to simply go with this unstoppable force, a pulse that's ahead of the beat, the chords, which are at once friends as adversaries--a measurement of his progress in the face of destiny, fate, death.  Small wonder that Lee Konitz, upon joining up with the last trio for a European session, nearly had a fatal heart tack, thinking he was about to die while playing with Bill (he was rushed by ambulance to a hospital).  Quite to the contrary, Bill was all about pushing back the inevitable walls of time and destiny and creating new tomorrows.  He ingores both Hamlet's \\"All is readiness\\" and Lear's \\"Ripeness is all,\\" questing like Coltrane, but not upward but forward, to overcome the too-certain boundaries that we all face.  Only artists like Bill seek some means of leveraging a victory through music--but of course it's never \\"only music.\\"  It's a language that unearths the unspoken thoughts of all mortal beings, their fears, doubts, and responses in the face of all.  In all of his urgency and unwillingness to quit, we can go only so far.  But to experience it is, as many have said, sufficient reason to walk away periodically and not merely marvel but medidate upon what we've just heard.  It's something to ponder over, provoking discovery of feelings, apprehensions, and plans of action that, if you find the one, only musicians know.y and single-mindedly. Bill is, above all, an artist afraid of closure!  Death, finality, stasis--the man is repelled by such considerations.  Every note that he plays is pianistically \\"in motion\\"--at the merest suggestion of a cadence Bill will play an unexpected rapid figure in his right hand; he starts and stays with a trill in his left hand (unheard of in most jazz pianist's work); he plays ascending and descending moving octaves in major 9ths (a variation on the chromatic 2nds of his frequent chord clusters).

He ingores both Hamlet's \\"All is readiness\\" and Lear's \\"Ripeness is all,\\" questing like Coltrane, but not upward but forward, to overcome the too-certain boundaries that we all face.  Only artists like Bill seek some means of leveraging a victory through music--but of course it's never \\"only music.\\"  It's a language that unearths the unspoken thoughts of all mortal beings, their fears, doubts, and responses in the face of all.  In all of his urgency and unwillingness to quit, we can go only so far.  But to experience it is, as many have said, sufficient reason to walk away periodically and not merely marvel but medidate upon what we've just heard.  It's something to ponder over, provoking discovery of feelings, apprehensions, and plans of action that, if you find the one, only musicians know.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|This latest album is much better suited to Susan's lovely voice than the previous album release. She has such a talent and delivers songs so well especially those suited to her voice and style as are most all  in this album. It is great to find Memory after having heard her do it so well as she became well known. Adding the duets is a real treat and those songs are well done and lovely to listen to. Over the Rainbow, the lead song. is a great disappointment. Artist that she is, I know Susan can sing the melody of this inspiring and beloved song. Whose idea was it to have her wander all over the melody seeking the tune she certainly knows? I don't know what that style is called but please leave it to the wannabes who can't sing anyway. Just let Susan sing the many outstanding musical show songs she does so well. Please.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I was looking for a calendar app that synchronizes well to Google calendar and therefore to my Mac calendar.  CalenGoo worked, whereas the native Android app did not sync properly for me.  Be aware that after you install CalenGoo, it will not sync calendar events that were entered prior to the install.

B006LR0XLM|5.0|I gave Dropbox 5 stars because it just works without problems.  I use Dropbox on a Mac and Android phone.  Once setup, it requires no attention.  Many Android apps work with Dropbox, but app-purchasers would be wise to check before purchasing an app.  Besides its expected functionality, the Dropbox app for Android even magically and automatically uploads new photos from the phone to Dropbox as soon as a wifi connection is available.

B007JNWJMI|4.0|While looking for an app that is close to Adobe Photoshop, I tried some half dozen different photo editor apps.  I wanted comprehensive photo-editing features, without fluff.  While PicsPlay is a worthy app, I found that PicSay Pro was a better match for my needs, and that is why I dropped a star.  If PicsPlay is not what you are looking for, I recommend having a look at PicSay Pro.

B004UID2LC|4.0|At times, this app has worked well for me.  Problem is, Youtube seems to do what it can to prevent people from downloading Youtube audio or video.  So, a game of cat and mouse results.  Whenever Youtube makes a change, apps like this are apt to quit working until the developers find a way to work around the newly created Youtube hurdle.  If this download program doesn't work at the moment, try another.  I have noticed audio files downloaded from YouTube Free are of very low bit-rates, which may or may not be a problem for you.

B004GYY714|5.0|For years I have been trying to access my favorite radio station for night time listening.  I live in an area where reception is not great, and even though I have Sirius Radio, could not find my station.  My husband suggested we check to see if my Kindle Fire had a radio app.  Much to my surprise he found it immediately, and now I can listen to my favorite night time talk show.  The reception is so clear . . . and I am very happy!
B008TFVHXM|5.0|This book changed my life, freshman year of high school. We had to read this because it was required, and I did not want to read the book because I hated required reading. However, when I finally set down and read the book, I did not want to put the book down. Harper Lee pieced this book together in an exceptional way, and I did not want to stop reading. I recommend this book to children and even young adults.

B008RZF2I0|5.0|OK, one of the biggest obstacles to overcome for any band is a change of the lead singer.  That said, Kamelot pulled off an absolute coup with Tommy Karevik.  To fans familiar with his performance with Seventh Wonder, which is vocally over-done and over-dramatic to be generous, be prepared to be astounded.  He is neither on this production.  Without notice, any listener of this new album could be confused and think that they are actually hearing Khan belting out the lead.  There are brief moments where Tommy sounds like \\"old Tommy\\", but they are very few; on the whole, Tommy sounds like Khan.  I am not sure such an ideal replacement of a lead signer has ever happened, such as this!<br /><br />This is the best logical progression - talent and music-wise - since \\"The Black Halo.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy!
0547995660|4.0|The Giver by Lowry is an exciting book for teenagers, that we read in the school. It is a very imagination story and I like how Lois Lowry describes the memories that The Giver transmitts to Jonas, the protagonist of the book. The characters are described in great detail and also the community. It is also a very funny book where all the rules are important for childs. I could image the landscape very well. Some chapters are a bit boring, because they were a bit to detailed. I recommend this book for all how like imaginative stories.
B007SGM084|1.0|Does not have a plot, very simplistic reading, not even erotic!  It is trash at its best! Boring, repetitive and the characters are dull and predictable.  An adolescent book without character that is painful to read.
B009SCR7RU|5.0|This movie delivers, fairies, cute animals, goofiness and sentiment. Tink has a sister? Great, we'll take it. My daughter is 3 and loves these movies. So do I as they aren't full of slapstick violence. Keep them coming.

0812993292|5.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a remarkable journey for the character as well as for the reader.  As the reader accompanies Harold, events from his/her own life are reminders that everyone's journey is unique with triumphs and tragedies.  The author skillfully uses the language to evoke empathy from the reader:  to allow the reader to encourage Harold in his quest.

Even with cheaper IEM's or headphones I'm sure this would help.<br />Now I'm looking for a good set of over the head/ear phones in the $100-$150 range to try with these. I've read lots of reviews and people say this amp can take an OK HP and make it sound MUCH better. Can't wait!<br />[[ASIN:B003R0FJKG Westone UM3X Triple Driver Monitor Earbuds (with Removable Cable)]]
0061353248|5.0|Had real fun reading the book. It was nice to observe that some of the concepts of human psychology are so predictable and can be exploited in so many ways. The examples in the book were nicely selected and made it a light and fun reading. I gained a lot about how companies exploit some of our predictable behaviour to their advantages.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This in one amazingly sick and twisted work of art.  Certainly the best psychological thriller I have read in awhile.  It is a murder mystery, sure, but much much more.  It is brilliantly structured and populated with compelling characters -- from the majors to the minors.  Especially the main characters who sweetly creep into your head until you believe you know them intimately and then you don't know who or what you are dealing with -- much like this husband and wife whose understanding of each other is shockingly underestimated.  Love it or hate it, abnormal psychology is fascinating.  And this story explores the subject to a degree that is insidiously hyper normal.  Meaning, this tale of fiction is like a distorted mirror reflecting our voyeuristic and media-crazed culture.  And, in a bizarre way, it could be a metaphor for marriage.<br /><br />And in the end, beware, the love you create may be equal to the love you hate.<br /><br />Todd Crawshaw, author, [[ASIN:0615311792 Exploits of the Satyr]]
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Show about a zombie apocalypse NO ONE IS SAFE! The only character that I wouldn't worry about is Rick and even he might meet his end eventually.  I think although sad it's a good thing for everyone to be \\"expendable\\" if none of the main cast ever died the show would lose its edge.<br /><br />And to think we are all intelligent productive members of society, hooked on a zombie show!!<br /><br />I look foward to Sunday evenings now!!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing writing. Couldn't put it down. Plan to reread it immediately as there is much I missed in the first reading.
1936608618|5.0|So you think you are fit, huh? You think that running countless miles every week will make you a better runner? Think again! Brian McKenzie has spent years putting this book together in a clear and consise manner that will change the way you think of endurance sports forever.  I found CrossFit endurance about 4 years ago in college while training for Triathlons and I was just simply running out of time to fit all my training in.  The long-slow distance methodology is antiquated and just plain time consuming.  Throw out everything you know and learn a new trick!  You will not be disappointed by educating yourself and opening up your schedule to something other than a 20 mile run everyday!

B004UJAOLM|3.0|I had decided to read the classics which I have heard about. Wasn't impressed with this one. Language was difficult to get into, so story line for me wasn't worth the effort. A lot of very dysfunctional people, don't have to read a classic to find that.

B009RI4FRU|5.0|\\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" opened to mixed reviews, but yours truly finds it to be a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining look at life and love as seen through the eyes of two \\"troubled\\" preteens. Sam and Susie, the youngsters at the heart of this film, are a bit like Bonnie and Clyde. They're both a bit antisocial and they both unleash a storm of trouble--often without intending to. Their form of rebellion starts out innocently enough when they decide to run away together. They are, in effect, eloping. Sam, an orphan, is trying to break away from all the foster families that just don't understand him. And Susie, who lives with her mother, father and three brothers, is trying to enter some kind of fantasy world like the ones in the books she reads. She, too, is often misunderstood, but in Susie's case it's largely her own fault for embracing and expressing ideas that are [deliberately] alienating to those of her parents and siblings. Sam, on the other hand, seems genuinely to dance to the beat of his own drummer. If Susie is something of a poseur, Sam is unabashedly eccentric! Well, after hooking up and hiking out (they live on an island and, Sam, a Khaki Scout, wants to retrace the steps of a Native American tribe's so-called \\"Harvest Trail\\"), they are pursued by everyone and everything they're trying to leave behind--a troop of scouts, the local police, Susie's parents, a social worker and their own prelapsarian states of mind. It isn't long before they realize that, while there's no Garden of Eden for them anywhere on the island, one's home isn't entirely in one's head, either. There's a trade-off that has to be made between living one's dreams and sharing a life with all the other misfits and crazies who co-inhabit the entirely too physical reality over which none of us has any more control than we do our own thoughts and feelings!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love fantasy/scifi that establishes \\"rules\\" for an alternative world that make sense and are stuck to.  Harkness does this really well not to mention a creative plot and compelling characters.  Definitely recommend this to anyone.
B005SDB6RK|5.0|Love Art of Flight! Great film! Amazing documentary on the greatest snowboarders in some of the most coolest places on earth!
B00932AA5G|5.0|Norwegian film makers get it!  They know how to make a movie that is \\"American-friendly\\" whereas most other Euro film makers produce bland movies that few Yanks enjoy.  This is an exceptionally well-executed movie which is based on a Norwegian best selling novel. It is full of twists, turns, and action. It is a dark love-story, but it contains excellent dramatic elements that keep one on the edge of one's seat. Yes, it has English subtitles, but I find that after a few minutes I don't even realize they are speaking Norwegian. The brain compensates. But then I am a trained linguist with a rather wide knowledge base of languages. If you can handle the subtitles, you will love this movie! one of the first excellent Norwegian movies I watched was DEAD SNOW. It is a Nazi-Zombie horror-thriller and if you want you can watch it on YouTube: [...]<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Thanks for reading this brief review. Watch the movie and let me know what you think.  ROB
B00014NE62|5.0|I've been a real fan of this film for many years - since it was first released.  One of Hugh Grant's early films.  This was a replacement purchase - I had the dvd before and wanted another copy.  I wish it was available in Blu-Ray.<br /><br />This film came out in 1987, when I was 23.  There were precious few gay-themed films available, and fewer that actually seemed to portray a real gay life - the ups and downs of growing up in a world that made life as difficult as possible for gay people, but showed the bright spots as well.  You can't choose who you love, even when society tries to force you into certain roles and classes.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film, set in Edwardian England.  I love it!!!  Can't even tell you how many times I've watched it already.
B009SCRERI|1.0|I thought I was actually buying the DVD.  I haven't had time to watch it online.  I usually buy DVDs to watch in downtime, after the holidays and during those dreary winter days.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|Love the books more than the movie.  Similar story line, but the differences and details are amazing.  Classic Ludum awesomeness.

B005URRCUY|5.0|This CD is so freakin' good and puts me in such a foxy mood, this 44 year old woman feels like putting on low cut blouse, boots, and dancing the evening away. Seriously, the musicianship is amazing, Dan's vocals are better every CD, and Patricks drums are mind blowing. Much much, more than just a beat, his drums are a rythemical compenent of these songs that WORKS! Buy it. You can't regret it.

B008OOYALE|5.0|This is overall a great game. You should be able to have more breeding dens and evolution temples, but other than that, it is a great game. I like how you can recieve gold from your friends because this sets it apart from the other games where you have to fork over dough to really enjoy it. 5 stars.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I'm a fan of Johnny Depp but I was disappointed with this movie. The story is not very solid or interesting. It just doesn't make any sense. I wouldn't recommend this movie, it was a waste of time.
B007704HO6|5.0|I've just read this book over the course of a day. It was a heartwarming story of recovery and friendship. The author described his recovery from a terrible addiction in a way that could hopefully give others hope. And as someone who usually ignores big issue sellers I will not be ignoring them anymore and I now have a new found respect for the people selling that magazine. As someone who had a cat that Bob reminds me of in some ways I was glad to know that other people are as close to cats as I was to mine.  I hope that there will be another book of James and Bob's life
0316069884|5.0|This book was well researched and well written. It is a quick read while at the same time dense with vital information. I cannot imagine not knowing this information - this should be taught in school. Read this book and know what you are putting in your body.

B000SEGUDE|2.0|Cloud Atlas has to be one of the most difficult books I've ever read.  The book has received acclaim and will soon be widely seen as a movie featuring Tom Hanks, but I can't imagine how the story can be presented cimematically.  David Mitchell creates words and convoluted phrases I've never heard or used, and his writing style runs the gamut from choppy journal notes to elegant phrose.  Adding to the difficulty are different story lines that seen detached from one another.  Sometimes I'd read a sentence three times and still not know its meaning.  I finally gave up and admitted defeat before finishing the book.  I'm still shaken by self-doubt.  Why was this so hard for me?  I have a good education and hold advanced degrees but feel I'm on the short end of this one.  Any recommendation I'd give for this book is to challenge potential readers to take on its complexities as a measure of your fortitude, reasoning ability, and composure when confronted by a literary puzzle that defies expectations.  If this is what it takes to be a great writer, then I'll never be one.
B000I9YLUI|4.0|This is good, directed more for today's audience but still enjoyable. I don't like that several parts of the book are missing-but that's creativity for you. Acting is fine.  My favorites and truer to the book are the BBC versions from the 80's and 90's. (David Rintoul and Colin Firth playing Darcy).
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book tells you how to do it, Understanding the terms is easy. A great help to a self publisher, you can not go wrong.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Featuring a very cool lenticular cover and neat, compact box with a slip page booklet (not dissimilar to the Bond 50 box set) this box set will be a proud addition to anyones collection and I'm sure will take pride of place on a typical BD shelf.<br />The HD transfer is simply beautiful and surprisingly so considering the vintage of the original airings.<br />The episode booklet is a nice touch and is better than the average \\"booklet\\" included with most TV show collection sets. It's a high quality softcover book and is put together well.<br />I certainly understand why a lot of reviewers want the extended versions of the episodes. It's human nature to want \\"more\\" rather than less but personally I actually prefer the original episodes that were aired, in the correct format as they were intended for TV.<br />The original length episodes have a better pace and are leaner and more effective in my opinion. The extra gags certainly don't contribute to the plots and if anything dwell a little too long on minor occurrences which bog down the plot with cheap one liners. Keep it moving I say :)<br />And on this point I have yet to concede any \\"extended\\" or \\"directors cuts\\" (Blade Runner probably being the only exception) to being better than the original featured movie/tv episode.<br />More often than not I walk away thinking the editor was right culling down redundant scenes and tangents that don't really add anything to the story.<br />But I digress, at the end of the day at approx. $150 this boxset will reward the viewer with hours of laughter and joy at an affordable price.<br />So for those of you not willing to wait for the extended versions that may or may not be released I say jump on board and start enjoying this charming and witty TV show and take comfort in knowing that it's a nice box set that has had a lot of thought put into it.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|There are enough reviews on this story to cover all the angles.  This is one of the most enjoyable reads I've experienced in quite some time.  Pi's story is one of great triumph over the most adverse of all situations, physical and mental.  Either story you choose to prescribe to at the end will haunt your thoughts.  Hopefully the film will do justice to the book.

B0041KVZ1I|3.0|Abbey Road is the best thing ever committed to vinyl. It's the reason Edison was put on this earth, to pave the way for these four men to make this music and save it for all of us. So how the heck do they allow such a bad pressing? Rainbo - really? The sound itself under the noise is really quite good but I can't imagine how they allowed these half-*ss pressings to go out. I'm returning mine and maybe trying a UK pressing. I hope they allow QRP to press the mono set - I'd hit that.

0439023513|4.0|Is it perfect?  Of course not.  Is there a happy ending?  How could one expect one, under the circumstances.  Do lots and lots of people die?  Yep.  Does Katniss choose Peeta or Gale?  Hehehehehe.<br /><br />I may have ended up liking this one the best of the three of them.  It has a downright cynical streak, which is richly deserved.  I also like the reasons that Katniss chose who she chose in the end.<br /><br />It's a pretty good ending to a pretty good series!

I am<br />a screenwriter, my nome-de-plume is Chany Catala, and, I have authored a couple of scripts that I hope will soon come<br />to life, one specially witten for Tom! Ok! Thomas Cruise Mapother 4th! we all know you are the coolest dude in the planet!<br />Put down your fists and guns, and, listen to Chany, and, thus, become a Romantic! Bullies at schools are watching! a dear  and faithful fan of Tom! (I have good taste)
B00A17AD36|5.0|An amazing new artist. Even though, his first mixtape came out almost 2 yrs ago. Everything about him is different from any other type of R&B out there. So much so, is hard for me to classify him in such genre. For those that think is voice is over processed, simply don't have an ear for good vocals. Yes, he adds the echoing effect to portions of his songs. But, that is to give a ghostly sound. To be compared to someone like The Dream is honestly the biggest insult an artist can receive. Take into consideration the fact the Able was 19-20 yes old when he created these songs, with the resources a young man can have, and be able to create such art. Comparing him to a 35 yrs old producer (want to be singer) that has the backing from a major label, funding and access to the top music studios and technology in the world is truly unfair. There is a reason why The Dream has never been on tour. Or even has performed live. Everyone that has seen Abel (The Weeknd) live can attest to the fact, he sounds exactly the same on the CD as in person. This can't be said for most artists now-a-days. Even the topics covered, sound more like rock n roll lyrics than an R&B heartthrob. I can't imagine Usher or Trey Songz being too blunt in their words. My only critic is his dancing skills. (all in good fun). He needs to stop doing the \\"Tootsie Roll\\" when he gets inspired on stage.<br />Love his music and wishing him longevity and health. As we have seen too many great artists inducted into Club 27 ([...]), for living the life he sings about.

0060873175|1.0|Michael Crichton must be turning over in his grave.  Word is he wrote a sketchy outline for this novel shortly before he passed away; how much more than that is up for debate.  Richard Preston was then recruited to flesh it out in order to pass it off as a legitimate publication.  Based on the inferior writing style, it is probably safe to assume that Preston is the de-facto author of 95% of this book.  I don't know -- maybe his heart just wasn't in the project, or maybe his car was double-parked outside -- because it is rushed and horrible.<br /><br />The main problem?  It reads more like one of those Junior Scholastic books for school kids than it does a serious scientific work targeted for adults.  In fact you can even convince yourself a school kid wrote it.  Now, I'm paraphrasing here, but my intent is to demonstrate my lasting impression of the narrative after I finished the book:<br /><br />\\"....Rick was worried.  He didn't feel good.  He felt sick.  He didn't like feeling sick.  He found it hard to fly a micro plane when he was sick.  Maybe it was the wasp venom in his blood.  Or the spider antivenom.  He lost control of the plane.  He tried to steer it away from a tree branch, but it was too late.  He hit the tree branch.  But luckily he just bounced off.  These micro planes were really tough.  Then he flew into a rough patch of turbulence.  He lost control of the plane.  Then it began spiraling. It looked like all was lost.  But wait --  he wrenched the wheel back just in the nick of time got the plane stable again....\\"<br /><br />Whoa, who farted in here?  Talk about bellylaughs.  How could a major publisher like HarperCollins let something this bad fall through the cracks?  Maybe after Crichton passed away, their one and only proof reader died too.  You'd think there'd be at least SOMEONE on the premises to remind the author of the cardinal rule of writing:  SHOW, don't tell.<br /><br />The characters are pretty bad, too.  Not one was believable or likeable.  And for a group of shrunken humans terrorized by insects their equal in size... they just didn't quite seem to express the requisite level of terror.<br /><br />And lastly, for an intended work of science fiction, the science contained within is laughable.  How is the process of shrinking humans to one half inch achieved?  Well... by magnets, of course.  Great big, powerful magnets.  That's pretty much it.  Don't wait for details.  Magnetism also somehow plays a role in reversing the \\"microbends,\\" a condition that afflicts miniaturized living organisms, eventually fatal if not arrested in time.  Again, don't ask how; it just does.  The other glaringly obvious question is how could the lungs of humans millimeters in size absorb oxygen molecules that have not been similarly miniaturized?  The author recognizes this dilemma as well, briefly drawing attention to it in the story.  Yet he offers no explanation.  Sorry -- simply acknowledging a problem doesn't let an author off the hook.<br /><br />In a previous review I concluded that Richard Preston might need more seasoning in the realm of fiction.  I revise that position.  His fiction is flat out awful and beyond help.  He ought to stick with non-fiction only.
0307887448|5.0|This is one of the best, if not the best, fiction novels I have ever read. A great mix of 80's nostalgia and sci-fi. Love, love,loved it!
B0071MQ37E|5.0|An incredible 2 hours and 42 mionutes of sheer enjoyment. A must see for everyone who loves the Phontom. Ypou wuill not regret any m inute of it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is a definite must have for those who love physics based puzzles. Bad Piggies offers a new take on this game type and succeeds brilliantly. Please note however, that unlike angry birds it takes more trial & error plus some logic. Therefore young kids will get frustrated fast. For everyone else it's a sure thing. One complaint is that the ads are way over the top. I'm not going to complain about a free version because it has ads, people are getting way to expectant for that sort of thing.  However, having your game stopped right in the middle of a level to load a video advertisment was too much, especially on a device like the Kindle Fire. I think the way Rovio handled their free versions with ads on the previous Angry Birds games was perfect. Hopefully they'll go back to doing it that way again.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|What a cult classic. This series is a must own and yes the FX is cheesy but its what makes it so cool
1439152802|4.0|Intriguing, engaging, interesting, romantic.  I enjoyed the different characters and the unpredictability of their actions.  Fun and enjoyable to read.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|I purchased evil dead 1 and 2 as well as AoD. I think these films really kicked off my love of Sam R's films. What a genius and true artist!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great, is accurate, good links for more info, like severe weather alerts, good advisory, great app!  highly recommended.  works great on kindle fire hd.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|Lots of bad pressings in my box. It's going back.<br /><br />Update: Amazon sent me a replacement but I am still having problems. 1 stars for pressing issues, 4 stars for sound, 5 stars for the music.<br /><br />The sound of most of these discs is fantastic. Better than the cds!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you have not watched this series, you must.  Can't wait for the next season.  Maggie Smith is the best.
B0090YHSFC|2.0|All you got to do is wait for them to randomly bunch up. Then a quick swipe and assuming none of them randomly break your line win.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I got this game for my Grandson to play, on my Kindle Fire, when he is visiting on the weekends but now I play it every chance I get.  I save up the prizes for him to cash in, so he can play more when he is here.  Great fun!!
B008N5UX9M|4.0|British Lion is a Fall 2012 release from Iron Maiden bassist Steve Harris.<br /><br />In the world of heavy metal, the name Steve Harris is legendary - in Iron Maiden, he is the founder, bassist, and primary songwriter. When I found out he was releasing something outside of Maiden, my curiosity was sparked immediately.<br /><br />British Lion isn't exactly a \\"solo album\\" from Steve Harris. It is actually a release from a band called British Lion, with Steve Harris playing with them and having written several songs. He has played something of a \\"mentor\\" role to this group of musicians since the 1990s, and obviously it made more sense to put his name on the record for the sake of album sales. So it isn't exactly a solo album from Steve, and it isn't exactly a British Lion album. You might say it's something in between (hope I cleared that up without confusing you further!)<br /><br />The first thing that needs to be mentioned is the biggest thing of all - the album sounds NOTHING LIKE IRON MAIDEN. The sound on the record could best be described as mainstream, modern rock with elements of old 70s hard rock thrown in, like distorted, loud guitars. Another thing that one will likely notice quickly on the album as one of the major flaws of the release - very flat, bland production. This alone is a major blow to the album. Additionally on a number of tracks the vocals seem to be buried under the loudness of the other instruments.<br /><br />Of course, the big question going through your head is probably whether or not the album is any good. It's really a matter of taste; I have no doubt this is an album that is really going to divide audiences. If you come in expecting this to sound like Iron Maiden, you'll be disappointed. But if you're a fan of straight-up hard rock with an open mind, you may be pleasantly surprised by what you find here. People have been bashing the vocalist on the album, and for the life of me I can't possibly see why - I think the guy sounds great. Ican't help but wonder if the weak production has something to do with that. The album actually has some very good songs, and truth be told, I wouldn't mind hearing another record from this group of musicians in the future.<br /><br />Final verdict? Again, British Lion is going to be that album that divides audience, and whether or not you will enjoy it is all a matter of taste. But I think this is an album that fans of straight-up hard rock should give a listen to. The more I listen to it, the more it grows on me. You may end up being pleasantly surprised, just as long as you don't come in here expecting an Iron Maiden album. My actual rating for this album is closer to a 3.5/5 than a 4/5, but I am rounding up, the weak production being the biggest flaw of the release. This album comes recommended, but come in with an open mind.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have been looking to see this series n one shot for a while. It is a rgreat story and movie. They should made another one.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I always enjoy Nelson De Mille's books and his John Corey charecter. The Panther wound up to be an enjoyable book. My only problem, and the reason for only 3 stars, was that it takes a long time for anything to happen in the story. It was certainly worth reading but not one of DeMille's best.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Simply love this show. A little disappointed that they didn't follow the comics a little more close to story but a great rendition.
B000GWE44U|5.0|I had to go online to get answers to my burning questions about this movie. They were apparently explained in the book, and not in the movie. Classic horror - good stuff.
B009DZDJU6|4.0|The movie had barely anything to do with the book good special effect affects goo good special affects good acting overall happy to watch it
0385491026|4.0|This book is beautifully written. Elaine's early experiences with Cordelia are pivotal to who she becomes. However, if you spend most of the novel waiting for Checkov's gun to go off, you will be disappointed. Thematically, I understand why it doesn't (the past is the past, etc.), but I still feel cheated and manipulated when the central reason for turning the page is a ruse.
B0044WUJQ0|3.0|Halloween II has always been fascinating to me, because it is the first sequel I ever saw that picks up literally from the last frame of the original film and does not jump forward in time.  It is especially cool since it was filmed a couple years after the original, so it was not from a back to back shoot where they would have been there anyway.  The film itself is not quite up to par with the original as far as suspense, it is more of a straight up slasher flick with more violent and inventive kills, but definitely missing Carpenter's ability to build suspense while providing scares.  However it is still a very enjoyable sequel in comparison to the rest of the Michael Myers series, with some good performances, and an entertaining conclusion.  I'd give it a 7 out of 10.
0525478817|5.0|This was easily one of the best books I've read. It was really sad but so powerful. It made me feel every emotion. I would recommend this to anyone, really.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game! i play it ever time i get a chance! very addictive lol. they also have some pretty cool games.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|I recommend this book, that I have on my Kindle.  It is full of good information, and I appreciate the information provided.
B003L77G6A|3.0|This merry group of mismatched scientists have had quite a series of misadventures (all puns intended). Now things get crazier with a hard break-up and a harder rebound. Not to mention a heating relationship and quirky daydreams.<br />The one thing I was thinking brought a major slog to this season was Sheldon. Granted he has an extremely egotistical way about him, and I thought I'd gotten used to his science-ish insults, but this season proved me wrong. For most of the season, his insults really did go over the top for me. Because of it, while the show's audience was laughing, I couldn't get the urge to laugh, just roll my eyes and shake my head.<br />That's the only reason for the 3 stars, otherwise the crazy things the group did, all the quirky lines and antics, even Amy's insertion upon Sheldon that her filed of science is more authentic than Sheldon (WHOA! What!?) made this pretty enjoyable.<br />Very interesting watching a group of people progress in life with each other and adapt to new people coming into the foray.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Picked this up on a recent free app day.  Simple match 3 game with some bells and whistles.  The timer, in conjunction with the unbreakable squares, can make it somewhat challenging near the end, but overall, very easy.  Not much replay value though, so not a five star app for me.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I'm a big fan of Angry Birds and decided to give Bad Piggies a try--really fun construction game.  It's ran well on my Kindle Fire--no issues.
B008XG1X18|5.0|best thing ever!! I'm finding everything I need for holidays. presents. amazing recipes.  ones that are easy to make and some that are out of this world!!!
B004LUS390|5.0|I have next to no artistic ability but even so this app allows for some good doodles whenever I get bored. I can just imagine how great this app must be for anyone that knows how to use all of these tools to the fullest of their abilities. The single drawback is that the canvas is only as large as your screen size but that has to do more with the user's phone than it does with the app itself. For anyone that loves to draw, paint, sketch, or doodle, this app is perfect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|all my friends have minecraft for their ipods and a new update came out for the ipod but I cant get it on here! WHY?!!!!!
B009329ZF2|4.0|I highly enjoyed it. A good scifi film. A good film to add to your DVD or online movie collection.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|Needs some work. I find I'd rather go to the computer to shop ebay; however, it does provide an out if your computer isn't available.  I'd also say bidding should be left to the computer, I agree that the bidding process is suspect on the application.
B00001QEE7|1.0|It skips almost the whole movie. I miss placed the slip or I would have sent it back. I bought it for my daughter and she can't even watch it.

B000AMUU94|5.0|Timeless music,  a must have for any road trip. A gem of American culture and a sound that will take you away. Fast shipment, reliable seller.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Good cinematography.  Lousy story, directing, and acting.  The monologues in particular are really painful to watch.  Nothing else to say, really.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Awsomest app. Great...! It works like a champ with good connection. I use it all the time even to monitor my cameras. I log it and I can't wait to see what you'll come up with next.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|So this will be my first review for a game I definatly enjoyed.  It kept me busy for hours. Especially during my extremely boring work hours.  I say the game is worth its price.<br />Gameplay was pretty much as expected not to overly difficult. The puzzles gave me a mediocre challange.<br />Storyline was interesting.<br />Thank you Big Fish Games.<br />I am definatly purchasing Enigmatis 2
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|My older teens love this type of genre.  I find it creepy, which is why they like it.  Fun if you like to get creeped out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead had always been a favorite since the premiere, but season 3 has blown me away with its bold storytelling, riveting characters, and amazing cast.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have the game downloaded on my android and it was free. So why is it $2.99 on the kindle? I could see if it was $0.99 but its only in HD sooooo not fair. I love the game, just don't think I should have to pay $3.00 for it.<br />thanxxxxxx
B009361C5O|5.0|This is always the first thing I put on a new computer is the proper version of AVG.  I did that with the new ASUS tablet and have had no problems and no conflicts.  I have had protection on all of my internet work and on all new apps I have been loading up to get the Asus tablet like I want it.  I don't understand the other reviewers problems as I have not experienced any of them - the trick may be putting this on first before you are infected.  I recommend AVG over all other virus, internet and spyware prevention software.  It takes up less memory and runs faster then any other virus software!  Try the free version first if you have any doubts then before loading up a bunch of software buy  this full version. It will be the best money you spend to protect your Android tablet!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Really liked it until I realized that those times that it changed my tiles because it said I had no more moves wasn't always true! Fun, but uninstalling.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's a cute and entertaining lil game. I don't feel obligated to spend real money to be able to advance or have fun. Well worth the download. It's a nice way to pass some time.
B000683VI4|5.0|This one of my favorite movies that I put in my library of dvds to have. This is a wonderful story which is up there with Love Story. Get if you are a romantic like me.

1936608618|5.0|This book serves as a \\"must have\\" guide for the casual athlete, to the contender in all of us. I found all of the information regarding multi-sports incredibly well laid and methodical. It was also great to see all of the picture examples relating to proper form on weightlifting. It was like having my own personal trainer standing there. I just wish this book was out when I started training years ago!  Pick it up!  You will not regret it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Fits the fire like a glove.  Not flashy, but gets the job done.  I wish there was sometype of clasp to hold the cover shut other than the elastic band, but it is not a deal killer.<br /><br />Hard plastic back, flexible plastic front that helps support the build in stand.<br /><br />If you want an ultra low profile case that offers good protection this is the one.  No fancy graphics will be found here.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is the best calculator. that I ever ought on the kindle fire all the other ones were bad!!!!!! so get it!!!!
B0090YHSFC|5.0|a nice and challenging game, no excessive permissions to worry about, and enjoyable as a time killer<br /><br />would like to see some kind of indicator that lets you know what percent of the floe has to be sliced off, as you can't tell how much more to cut to complete the level you're on<br /><br />reasonably well done and kids can enjoy it as much as adults :-)<br /><br />reminds me of an old game where you had to capture balls in small areas to complete levels, but don't recall its name<br /><br />good job
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|This is a fantastic release. The remaster sounds awesome!<br />You really notice the improved levels on Architecture of Aggression<br />and any album that starts off with a burner like Skin O' my teeth<br />and ends with a cruncher like Ashes in your mouth is a killer album!<br /><br />The live CD is why alot of people will buy this and its great to have<br />a live release from this lineup doing a awesome set list.<br /><br />What can we do to get Mustaine to play The Conjuring live again!?!?!
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Sound is really astounding. Massive high gain amp sound perfect for metal practice. The best thing about it is how much more you get around to practising, I have my Amplug left in my Strat with a set of good headphones plugged in and its just too easy to pick up and practice a riff or some other exercise. Can easily tally up 3 hours of practice a day, consistently without even trying. Battery lasts forever, its so simple you can't really break it, its super portable and did I mention that it sounds amazing?<br /><br />I also own the mini cabinet but its not very impressive but handy in a squeeze. Never really use it.<br /><br />Buy an Amplug!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I tried to purchase this but was told that there was a problem, so therefore I could not.  Sure hope it gets fixed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does what you expect. I personal like have a percentage and a large animated widget. Also the graphs are nice to see when you use your power and how long a charge takes.
159420411X|4.0|\\"Thomas Bayes was an English minister who was probably born in 1701 - although it may have been 1702.\\"  Nicely subtle, like much else in the book.
B0064NTZ6W|2.0|While Photograpy was excellent, I found the poor quality of the sound,in the German quite distracting; and the cast itself seemed to forget there was an audience. I certainly hope the other DVDs' offer an alternative.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Very good book. It was not as emotional as book 1 but made me anxious to know what will happen next.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Ben Shepherd has an awesome quote which sums up Soundgarden and Classic music/bands in general it's\\"you can be any age you have been at any time,doing music and being creative in any way no matter what you do creatively you are ageless your ancient and your young at the same time\\"- Ben Shephard.This Quote is essential the Beautiful Beast of Soundgarden.King Animal is one of those albums thats a hybrid of Down On The Upside,Superunknown,Euphoria Mourning(Chris Cornell solo album)and hints of Badmotorfinger & Ultra Mega Ok.This Album is essentially songs \\"July 4TH\\",\\"Gun\\",\\"Mind Riot\\",\\"Head Down\\",\\"Applebite\\",\\"Overfloater\\",\\"Switch Open\\" rolled into one.A type of homage yet still a progression at the same time,Nostalgia worthy songs would be \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\" \\"Bones of Birds\\" \\"Black Saturday\\".This Album delivers exactly as would any past effort of SG.Be Warned its a classic album from the stand point of average actual albums, but as a Soundgarden album it fits in perfectly no better or worse then any other Classic Album of SG.To put it Honestly if this where a New Bands First Album we would be hailing them the saviors of Rock Music!!<br /><br />Pros: Solid SG Album everything you miss from Soundgarden is very much present in all aspects of this album.<br />The album art work is there best by far Beautiful meaning and up for any interpretation.<br /><br />Cons: Its not Superunknown,Down on the Upside or Badmotorfinger maybe even Louder then love depending on your taste of Sg.<br /><br />In Conclusion it's a Must have album that shows more growth of the people of Soungarden then Growth in the musical experimentation.Pick it up you wont regret a thing :)
B008G59IKO|4.0|November 13th marked the release of the second part of Green Day's ambitious trilogy of albums, \\"UNO\\" \\"DOS\\" \\"TRE\\".  While the world eagerly anticipates the release of that final part, \\"TRE\\", they can momentarily abate their hunger by picking up \\"DOS\\", the excellent, though not quite masterpiece, follow-up to September's \\"UNO.\\"<br /><br />While \\"UNO\\" and the songs on it focused mainly on adolescent angst in songs like lead single \\"Oh Love!\\" and riffing on many other musical sub-cultures like techno on \\"Kill the DJ,\\" \\"DOS\\" is more concerned with songs about having fun and getting into trouble.  The opening track, \\"See You Tonight,\\" features lead singer Billy Joel Armstrong, singing solo over an acoustic guitar before the entire band suddenly rips into an extremely dirty-lyriced song called \\"F**k Time.\\"<br /><br />The entire album feels like a \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation, but with entirely new music.  Songs like \\"Stray Heart\\" feel like outtakes from \\"21st Century Breakdown\\" while \\"Ashley\\" and \\"Wow! That's Loud\\" could fit in perfectly with the \\"Dookie\\" track list.  But that's not to say that you won't have a fun time listening to it.  Armstrong and company visit both ends of their spectrum from punk-filled \\"I-don't-give-a-rip\\" tunes to slower, melodic songs filled with love angst, and everywhere in between, and they even go somewhere that I've never heard them before on the track, \\"Nightlife,\\" which sounds like it was picked straight off the playlist of some random nightclub.<br /><br />Though it feels sub-par compared to \\"UNO,\\" \\"DOS\\" should in no way, shape, of form, go uncounted among Green Day's more notable works.
B004EPZ034|4.0|I purchased this movie for my grand daughter, she likes it a lot. I would recommend this movie to people with children.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing the KISS/Motley Crue tour this last summer.  And it was during their show here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that they gave me eargasms with the howling opening track from their upcoming album, \\"Hell or Halelujah.\\"  After hearing it, I was super-stoked for this album; and when I finally got it, I was NOT disappointed.  Their twentieth studio album will go chronicled among their best like \\"Destroyer\\" and \\"Love Gun.\\"<br /><br />Starting off with the rocking \\"Hell,\\" the entire album is composed beginning-to-end of hard-rocking, head-banging material like \\"Wall of Sound\\" and \\"Shout Mercy.\\"  Not a single ballad is heard on the album, as members Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Tommy Thayer, and Eric Singer unleash a hellacious assault of rock and roll on our senses, mostly the one that allows us to hear this vicious assault.  This is KISS at the best they've been in recent years, and a HUGE improvement over their 2009 effort, \\"Sonic Boom,\\" which is saying something, considering THAT album was a masterwork on it's own.<br /><br />Any KISS fan worth their salt should have Monster by now, so I say this to all on-the-fencers, \\"I-like-em-but-don't-love-em\\"s, and any fans of rock in general: go out to the nearest record store and pick up your copy of \\"MOSNTER!\\" Like, right immediately!
0349001359|5.0|So...I finished reading Struck by lightning. It is hard to find the right words to describe my feelings right now. I will still try to write a little review, though.<br /><br />Again, Chris Colfer really amazed me. This story is about Carson Phillips, an outcast because he is different, stuck in an little town, desperately wanting to get out of there...he sure isn't perfect, in fact he is a prick sometimes. But still...he is full of dreams and is ready to do almost everything to reach his goal. No matter what. He fights for it. With Carson, Chris created a character who shows that everyone is able to dream, one just has to find themself, find something to fight for. Sure, that isn't easy. But if you trust yourself, trust your heart, you can do it. You just have to crack that nutshell around you, everyone else telling you what you can't do, everyone who hurt you and everyone who did you wrong trapped you in and...fly. Loving and accepting yourself, knowing it is ok to be you and show it, is an great start to do it. I personaly loved one passage in the book:<br /><br />Like having a great idea, life comes at you fast. It hits you and tries to escape and be expressed in anyway possible. In a way it is a lot like...lightning.<br /><br />So...what did `Struck by lightning' show me? What did it inspire me to do? A good question. I think...it inspired me to try and accept myself a little more every day, to actually get to know myself more. And who knows...maybe I will some day find my own dream and fly, even if that day seems to be so far away right now. And if that should ever happen, Chris Colfer will have done a lot to make it happen, without even knowing it. So I am saying THANK YOU, Chris. Thank you for being so amazingly talented, being such an inspiration, for...just being you. Please...never stop to fly.<br /><br />Greetings, Meike
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Eleven years.  That's how long it's been since Aerosmith released an album comprised of entirely new material.  And the end result of eleven years of inner turmoil and anticipation has resulted in \\"Music from Another Dimension,\\" which contains so much nostalgia that it practically oozes off the disk and out the speakers.<br /><br />Nearly every song on the album is filled with sounds reminiscent from all of Aerosmith's previous works.  \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" feels like this album's attempt at making a song in the vein of \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\" and \\"Legendary Child\\" feels like a Frankenstein's Monster in that it seems to have been assembled from the bits and pieces of Aerosmith's greatest songs, even going so far as to lift a lyric from \\"Walk This Way,\\" which all songs on the album seem to do, lifting lyrics from other songs.<br /><br />But is that a bad thing?  Hell no!  \\"Music\\" sees Aerosmith doing what they do best: being Aerosmith and doing it better than anybody else!  The duet with Carrie Underwood on \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" is like hearing Aerosmith trying their hand at country, while \\"Lover Alot\\" is among the funnier tracks on the album, consisting of lyrics ruder and cruder than I've ever heard Aerosmith before, including lead singer Stephen Tyler doing something I've never known Aerosmith to do before: curse like a sailor (though the album, surprisingly, doesn't carry a Parental Advisory label).<br /><br />\\"Music\\" is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it album and is garunteed to divide the band's fans, but there will be those, like myself, who will just sit back and enjoy the ride the album takes us on.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I will never buy this ever again unless you can get the paying price off the game! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! can you download the last version so I can play the better version
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Not as epic as we thought, but definitely worth watching. Great CG, good suspense, good acting, and cool action. I wish there was more a little more action.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|The humor is dry which I like.  My kids are 6 and 3 and while they enjoyed it, I'm not sure they were old enough to appreciate it.  Here's hoping multiple viewings over the years make it a family classic.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play and win. Quick auto finish is nice. Dislike the ad pop ups, but I guess that is what happens when stuff is free.
B008JAG9BW|1.0|My wife had been bugging me to see this since she loved the first two American Pies and liked the sweetness of American Wedding.  I relented and agreed to stream this.  I found it boring and amateurish.  It's been done before and the acots just seemed like they were going through the motions.  They should have stopped @ 2.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I'Ve tried other nonogram programs and this is definitely the best I've tried. The interface is very intuitive. My only complaint would be that I finish all the puzzles quickly and have to wait a while for updates to get new puzzles.
0812992792|5.0|Kudos to the author. He did a great job capturing what life must be like in North Korea. The story is a great one that comes full circle providing a gratifying reading experience. Not the most cheery book in the world but I ended up liking it way more than I expected. Again my highest praise is for the author doing such a stellar job at capturing what life must be like in North Korea. Add to that an engrossing story and characters you really care about and you have a great book.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|great movie..  the price was really good and my son loves the movie.  i don't know if we will ever use the digital copy or not but what the heck...at the price we got it for if we don't use the digital copy it doesn't really matter.  i think that has a time limit to use it by.
0316228532|4.0|It took me awhile to get into this book (I listened to the audiobook), but I am glad I stuck with it! I am a HUGE fan of Harry Potter, so I think it took me awhile to separate that JK Rowling material from this JK Rowling material. I find her descriptions of small town life and politics honest and interesting. If you are struggling with this book, at least read through pt. 1 before giving up.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|The Dvd's are in good shape but the dvd case came broken<br /><br />. I'm not totally satisfied with the purchase

B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I have read all of the Reacher series and this one was the first where it took more than a couple of days to read. I personally could not really get into the book- like another review states, bring back the head butts and brawls. I will read the reviews on the next book before I buy.
B009VB97EY|4.0|The story line and movie were so so, but I would watch again! LOL!<br />I enjoyed watching the dancing.The music was good as well.
0761169253|1.0|This should even be considered a book, more like a large pamphlet. This BOOK uses large fonts alot of spacing it covers entire pages in black with doodles done in white, which look like they were done by a third grader. If you were to take out all the garbage then format the writing like a normal book, this book would end up being about 5 to 10 pages long. If this is the best this person can do he should be ashamed to call himself an artist and author. I dont know this work ever fond its way into the marketplace .
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|fantastic movie! i saw a lot of very unique and fun kung fu ideas that could only come from a true movie fan such as the rza! there is a brass statue of a man that is in many movies as a training dummy for qi (chi) blocking attacks. in this movie there is the statue and a man with skin that can become brass at will, it links up toward the end in such a cool way i was blown away. i imagine the rza back in the 70's thinking \\"what if someone had to fight the qi training statue? then they would be really f*&%ed!\\"<br /><br />i could see where he deliberately paid homage to old kung fu films with some of the camera work, hair and acting styles, this kind of thing might look odd too someone who hasn't seen older kung fu movies as some of it seems corny or stilted (which is how those old movies are, something fans love!). but even so, they would get over it every time one of the AMAZING battles started.<br /><br />at first the rap music came off as out of place. this is coming from a wu tang clan fan since the 36 chambers, and digital bullet is one of my favorite albums, but they're in ancient china and it's all hip hop style which doesn't really match up, but it grew on me very fast and by the end i was bobbing my head to the beats and enjoying them with the fight scenes. i grew up listening to wu tang, and rza always puts cuts from classic kung fu movies in his music. it's really cool hearing them and then, years later, stumbling over the same lines or music while watching the movie they're from without knowing it ahead of time. it's like: \\"why do i recognize this? i've never seen this movie... oh yeah! wu tang!\\" this was the exact opposite of that and it worked pretty well! i'm watching a kung fu movie and thinking \\"wait a minute, i know that song!\\"<br /><br />and the story? phenomenal! really fun stuff going on and lots of surprises. russel crow is a riot in this movie. i was thoroughly entertained. i love buddhism, kung fu, and i dig the rza's music so the scene at the buddhist temple had me smiling from ear to ear.<br /><br />really great film!buddhist temple had me smiling from ear to ear.<br /><br />really great film!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Excellant book l think his best ..keeps you interested all the way through to the very last page.would recommend. To all his fans.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Can't get enough of this show, every episode every twist and turn, cast, love everything about the show, keeps u on the edge of the seat every scene and leave u wanting more at the end of each episode
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Nothing in this movie works...the sexual aspects are really awful not in so much the acts, but rather their total lack of relevance to the film.  Surprisingly the action is almost non-existent in this film.  The story line is just terrible as well.<br /><br />Only reason this film is getting two stars from me is because I watched the entire length of it...I reserve the one star ratings for films that I can't even finish.<br /><br />Pretty much standard Hollywood trash, don't waste your money on this movie!
B001E7OO2I|2.0|I'm OK with someone changing their sound a bit just to liven things up. However, there is about 80% less piano here and about 80% of the tunes are so lifeless here. He sings with next to no feeling. And the choruses are repeated too much. \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Take Me Away\\" are said painful songs to endure. Also this 3rd effort is way, WAY too upbeat. It gives the whole album an emptier vibe than I think John really wanted. \\"Green Light\\" is the only upbeat track here that I like. He steps out from the piano here and this song lights up the room. It just works. \\"Everybody Knows\\" and especially \\"This Time\\" are also really good tracks. \\"Quickly\\" featuring Brandy is OK but gets old. \\"No Other Love\\" featuring Estelle fairs a bit better and is a song you can get through without cringing. There is depth to be heard in some of the lyrics to the songs. In fact I really like when John is talking about not having love anymore cause here, like on \\"Everybody Knows\\" it really works. I felt his pain on that track. But most of the hooks here fall flat. I was shocked that I hated the majority of the album as much as I did. I honestly wouldn't care if I never heard this album again in my life. Yes, it's that bad, John. To put it bluntly he will only have to half try on his next CD to come up with better material than this because he's talented. But this is a mess. Seriously.<br /><br />So average it's painful. Skip it altogether.<br /><br />2.5 stars.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Once again Flynn delivers an entertaining Mitch Rapp thriller. I didn't rate it 5 stars because of the abrupt ending that left some issues unresolved. As a long time fan I am disappointed in the marketing of the book as representing a right wing conservative agenda. This liberal or taker per O'Reilly will look forward to the next book and hope Flynn continues to be entertainment and  not crossover to political propaganda..
B009DT9ANW|5.0|WOW!!! Don't miss out on this one. Peter got his guitar back and he is playing better than ever and he always was top notch in my opinion.
0399226907|5.0|As an artist, art educator, and mom, I truly adore the work of Eric Carle. I love The Hungry Caterpillar. As a teacher, this was a classic for curriculum integration in kindergarten and first grade. My students loved making their own hungry caterpillars using paper towel tubes. This book is great for collage as well. Now though, I must admit to simply enjoying my son sitting in my lap as we read all the things the Hungry caterpillar eats and the tummy ache that follows. A great book for teachers as well new moms, grandparents, etc.<br />You just can't go wrong with Eric Carle.
B001JIHGO0|5.0|Loved everything about this movie. The werewolves are the most badass looking werewolves ever! Dracula was awesome, very intimidating. Dracula's brides are beautiful and crazy as hell when in vampire mode. The frankenstein monster plays a key role for the movie, wich is very nice. The automatic crossbow van helsing uses is beast! o and Kate beckinsale as Anna was perfect.
0805047905|5.0|Some people have complained about the format changes. All I can say is that my son doesn't care, he just wants mommy to read it one more time. How can you argue with that?
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee is a great author and he proved with this book.  To Kill a Mockingbird changed my life and I thank Harper Lee for his book.  This book is one of the best of all time and is my favorite.  Harper Lee is a great author and his books amaze me every time!!!
0689815816|1.0|I really did not like this book. My son who loves to be read to was rather apathetic to the story. He has not asked for it to be read again in over several months. I as an artist did not care for the illustrations. Better books to spend your money on.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game its addicting I like the finding the objects Cu's they usually aren't in the samenplacenso it make the game a little challenging sometimes an when you unlock a new rooms it also makes it a little more challenging
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I am so happy I made this purchase the CD is amazing and it is in wonderful condition. I will purchase more in the future!
B00005JSGK|1.0|I love John Wayne westerns and have many of them.  This movie is unbearable.  I watched about 30 minutes and gave up.  All the other 1 star reviews are complaining that the disc wouldn't play for them.  I bought mine at Walmart and it works fine, but, like I said, this movie is horrible.
B000002JR8|4.0|Pantera is one of a few american bands I can listen to without getting bored and exhausted.<br />Love the production and boldness.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I would give this show eleventy billion stars if I could. Zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie zombie
B002DKF47O|4.0|This is the first Behemoth for me.<br />I never thought myself listening to black metal until I discovered Dissection.<br />I love the general atmosphere and brutality of the music and I won't stop here.
1607066017|5.0|Hazel has her father's horns and her mother's wings.  Her parents come from two warring worlds, military deserters who chose love over combat.  A woman named Vez who sports a unicorn's horn hires a mercenary named The Will to kidnap Hazel and kill her parents.  The potential payday for The Will is huge, but he's not the only mercenary looking for the reward.  The Will's biggest competition is The Stalk, who looks like a crab on the bottom and a large-breasted woman on top.  Also after Hazel's mom is a dude/gadget named Prince Robot IV who has a television set (or maybe a computer monitor) for a head.  But it's not until chapter three that the story really starts to get freaky, and chapter four is even freakier (hint:  pleasure planet).<br /><br />The writing is smart and filled with wit, while the story is filled with surprises.  The characters are wonderfully unpredictable.  This truly is a saga in the sense that the story is just getting warmed up at the conclusion of the volume.  I look forward to seeing where it goes next.<br /><br />The art is gorgeous.  Some of sex scenes are graphic -- not quite pornographic, but graphic.  I liked it but I wouldn't give this to a little kid to read.  Besides, it's too good for little kids.
B0015HM6LS|5.0|Well, I discovered Dark Funeral after this band and I can say immortal played a big role of bridge to the black metal .<br />There are so much to appreciate their work and I love Abbath!
B008EZVNO0|4.0|[[ASIN:B008EZVNO0 Born To Sing: No Plan B]]  I love Van's music and he delivered some exceptional CDs in the last decade.  He stretched, he made us stretch, he paid homage to his inspirations and those that forged the way for him.  Each of those collections will be remembered as stellar for what they are.  But sometimes I just want to go into my personal \\"Van Morrison Space\\" which was set for me many years ago with Moondance.  With the arguable exception of \\"Magic Time\\", I have not found that space in his music since \\"Healing Game\\", but this one delivers.  Now, let's be real.  Van Morrison could not care less about my opinion and why I buy his music.  But Thank God there are times when his muses and my needs intersect.
B000FP2ZCQ|5.0|This band was discovered by one of the related videos on Youtube, and I was compelled to check them out!<br />I googled the band and found out the tragedy, had to buy all 3 albums produced by Dissection!<br />Dissection is definitely my ultimate favorite metal band and I can't find any song that I don't like after about 2 dozen repeated plays.<br />It never gets boring at all!
B0083BYZMM|5.0|this is a great cd, but I just learned that this cd will be released early next year on Shanachie coupled with their new DVD, as a 2 discs in one package...I'm thinking it's going to be cheaper than this import cd.  so if you can wait...
B0007Y08T2|4.0|As far as I remember right, this one had the most positive reviews saying it's so beautiful etc...<br />Well, it's not my cup of tea, I prefer Mind's I or Fiction, period!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always Grisham spins a good tale and keeps the reader interested until the end. I look forward to reading his once a year book and can't wait until the next one.Love the Kindle for easy access to the new books I want to read.
B001CISHU4|5.0|What more do I need from this band?<br />They get better and better and their live never disappoint me.<br />They remain in their unique color yet doesn't sound the same.<br />One of my Top 3.
B005LAII8K|4.0|A bright, complex challenge to some of time travel's longest-running traps, backed by a seriously curvy, dazzling plot. Although some holes can't be avoided, (that goes with the territory) Looper is able to lean on its high-concept premise for support during such moments and effectively gloss them over. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, no strangers to sci-fi action sagas, seem perfectly at-home in this oddly familiar future setting, and though they're hounded by a violent gang of darkly-clad killers, the film's darkest role alternates repeatedly between its two leading players. There's a  lot to celebrate in the details here, from the oil crusted, not-so-distant future (which, admirably, looks an awful lot like the present) to the strict rules and regulations of the core concept, and for a short while the film seems content to toy with the spoils of its own ingenuity. Of course, there's also a time for leaving such trivialities behind, and Looper doesn't back away from it. When push comes to shove, it smartly explores the depth and dimensionality of its cast before ultimately pursuing an unexpected, yet appropriate, final destination. Smart, savvy and convincing, my one qualm is that it's occasionally too passive in pressing the accelerator. Worthy of (and rewarding to) multiple viewings.
B000RIHBIE|5.0|I can't understand anyone, who doesn't like that album...<br />I am a huge Sum 41 fan and know all of their albums, even with all lyrics<br />and I can say: It is not the their best album, because Screaming Bloody Murder is :)<br />However I think this album shows the Real Sum 41 and it's one of the best albums, I ever heard.<br />Buy IT!!
B009LDMJGA|5.0|sounds like it could have been the follow up to badmotorfinder . A return to form . I did not like the last 2 releases , way too radio. There is no spoonman on this one. GREAT GUITARS !!!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|With most DVD's, I purchase for the extras, I really enjoyed watching the process of how and the techniques used in making the movie. Prometheus is a 'five star' movie as is the bonus material.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|This is not a legal thriller.  This is Grisham having a little fun, writing fiction not based on any actual event.  The story was clever and hooked you in, albeit a little predictable, but that was okay. It wasn't his best and wasn't full of twists and turns to keep you guessing. It was entertaining and a good read.  What more do you want from a novel?
B009T1J0PM|5.0|I chose 5 stars because you can not put the book down and it is very exciting. You are always sitting on the edge of your chair waiting for the next thing to happen. It feels like you are with Greg and going on his many adventures. Jeff Kinney you really published a great book.
B009VB97EY|4.0|cool movie i would recommend it to freinds funny had a blast watching it. a movie that ladies will love :)
B009VB9VKY|1.0|Love the actors but it wasn't enough to get me over the fact that it was a dull slow plot.
B007EECSFA|5.0|but it won't be my last! I was needing a book to entertain and keep my attention, and boy did this fit the bill.  And the twist at the end was so well done.  From some of the other reviews, this is not her best work, which really motivates me to read more.  I love historical novels, but some get so dry with the history angle, whereas this was just the right mix.  Well, gotta go download another of her novels.
B0088TG252|4.0|Not high art but well done as an action flick and enjoyable. Feel free to spend a few dollars here.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Everything has been pretty much said here already, but... this album is a mind blower...  As a huge fan of Susan, I purchased her first CD and was not that impressed.  Her voice on this CD is phenomenal and inspiring and her range is incredible.  It is especially priceless that she does the duets with Donny...  I love him so much... and they sing so well together.  I know Susan has a problem with stage fright, as does Donny, but they should both endure knowing how much pure joy they bring their audiences...  Thank you Susan and Donny... and kudos to you both for bringing us this beautiful collection of songs....
0316228532|3.0|It was just too depressing, and somewhat boring.  I decided to cut my losses and return the book to the library.  Why keep reading when I was not enjoying it?<br /><br />There were so many characters I had a hard time keeping them straight.  I didn't like any of the characters, and so didn't want to keep reading to find out what would happen to them.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Loved watching this again...15 years since I watched it last and it was just as good today as it was then.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I like all of the wimpy kid books, but this one wasn't exactly what I expected from Jeff kinney. It was ok, but I would give it no more than 4 stars definetly
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Guernsey is a wind-blown Shangri-la peopled by the kind of folk you call \\"folk,\\" without an s. Juliet is an author lucky enough to be best friends with a publisher and the publisher's sister, to have written a wartime series that became a bestseller when bound into a book, all by age 32. She's wooed by another highly influential, handsome, urbane, wealthy publisher while being wooed by a forbidding wisp of an island creaking with cows and pigs and people who join literary societies in order to read one and only one book for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />The Guernsey group is simple, happy, and undisturbed, except for the cataclysmic Nazi occupation which tears children from parents, introduces the populace to brutish cruelty, near starvation, filth, and abject terror, and tests the mettle of the strong and the weak and the average.<br /><br />The story, taking place during a short space of time in 1946, is told entirely through letters to and from the various protagonists (and one or two antagonists), along with a few telegrams and journal items. This form makes entry a little challenging, but the reader settles quite remarkably into the book's singular flow and pacing.<br /><br />Elizabeth is the center, the heart of the story, although only one letter, a note, really, appears in her hand. That brief note produces the most poignant moment in this most poignant of stories. Juliet is the focus of the story; it is her journey we are on.<br /><br />The characters are not complex, or, if they are, the horrors of wartime devastation wring complexity out of them, leaving only what is essential. That is alternately, fear, courage, determination, desperation, despair, hope, and sublimely, love.<br /><br />It is, ultimately, a love story. Yes, a couple fall in love and marry. But love reaches farther and deeper even than that. There is the love that gives up all to succor and raise an orphaned girl. Love that plucks a fragile young woman from the death camp that did not kill her into a human fount of life-giving benevolence. Love that rebuilds an island and a way of life, rock by rock. Finally, love that resists evil and takes a whip to the evildoer even when the action redounds on the great heart with a fatal bullet.<br /><br />I was moved by this account, by the hopeful thought that what is good and giving and loving can overcome the greatest evil our species has managed to contrive.t kill her into a human fount of life-giving benevolence.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just don't really even have words for how much I love this entire series.  Hands down one of the best bunch of books since Harry Potter.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a little crazy that you have to pay for apps, but its a fun game and I love it.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|I may not care for Mr. King's books - horror isn't my steeze at all - but I have a great respect for him as a writer and this book is a lot of fun as well as being informative.  Yeah, no, it's not some checklist of how to be a writer, but you know what?  There IS no checklist to being a writer.  You just are or you aren't.  But there are lots of nuggets in here that I found helpful and reassuring - like the fact that Stephen King's muse keeps secrets from him, too!  Good to know even the most famous writer in the past 20 years can't get everything out of his muse on his timetable, only the muse's.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I bought this case during the summer, even though the reviews were bad. I thought I might give this case a try, just because some people liked it. I got very excited about it, but right when I got it, I was disappointed. It was starting to chip when I was starting to open the case after the water test.  If you plan on using this case, then DON'T GET THIS!!! Once you drop it, it gets chipped and cracked, to the point where it is not waterproof anymore. I rated this two stars because it does give some protection: it is shockproof (to some degree). But overall, don't waste your money because you can get the same thing (but better) if you get an otter box! I'm glad that I have an old otter box; I'm going to use that!!! SO IF YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY READING THIS, I BET THIS ALL-CAPS MESSAGE WILL MAKE YOU READ THIS MESSAGE AGAIN!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
B009VB97EY|4.0|I'd been looking forward to this movie since I first saw previews before it came out on the big screen.  I'm glad that I waited to watch it without having to pay box office prices.<br /><br />Like I said, it was decent. Not the best though.  I think it fell short of its hype. I'd heard that it was supposed to be sexy but it was mediocre in that department.  If you like Channing Tatum, it's worth a watch, though I wouldn't if you're solely interested in watching Matthew McConaughey as he isn't as huge as he could be in the movie.
1935670913|5.0|This book was entirely up to the minute and informative about the publishing business.  I don't think I would like his books, but I love what he wrote &#34;about&#34; getting his books published.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|One of Wes Anderson's best films yet!I like how he's added more classic, big name actors (Bruce, Ed Norton...)  Yet, I hope he never shoots a film without Bill Murray.  And those two kids killed it!<br /><br />This will be a classic forever, right up there with Rushmore.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|its a really cute game... i love all the hats that you can put on the jelly fish... its not too easy and not too hard. great game for everyone(:
0062020897|5.0|Being very familiar with the location that is described in this book, I am blown away by the research the author did, and how accurate everything falls into place.<br /><br />The Eye of the Needle has been a winner way back when it was written in the late 80s, and is just as riveting today, for old and young and impossible to put down. I have been burning the midnight oil since purchasing 3 of Ken Follett's books from you, and have been a fan of his for years. I have read about 8 of his books so far. I can highly recommend this book.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I'm all for it.  Great movie, wonderful insights.  It's very in depth and really keeps your interest. It's also got a ton of music in it from all decades, first rate.
B0086213XW|5.0|The beauty between two people no matter how eccentric begins so powerfully and then relaxes into a more subtle romance.  The genius of this film is in taking one through this journey and portraying the temptation to mistake the relaxed subtle romance as a deficiency in the relationship, but it also guides one through the desire to experience passion again and how that power can be mistakenly attributted to a relatioship with another, but eventually also will relax.  It made me appreciate the specialness of my marriage and to be wary of mistaking passion that will eventually relax as something that is more special than what I have. I told my wife we should watch it once a month.
0307592731|1.0|I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping there would be some point to it and found there was none. The writing is uninspiring, boring even, the main character has no redeeming qualities. I trudged through it out of obligation to my book club, and to a good friend whose choice it was. A complete waste of time. No literary merit whatsoever. I can't believe that Oprah recommended this book.

B0089BSM70|4.0|I loved almost everything about this Blu-ray release. The weird cover, the special features I never thought I'd get. Both commentaries are amazing.<br /><br />However, this release was marred for me by the glitchy disc itself. The menu shows everything twice, is hard to navigate and the disc locks up on me frequently causing me to have to restart it.<br /><br />But, all in all, I am very happy with this release.
B007NG93CK|5.0|this book lives up to my expectations and experience of Kathy Reichs' mysteries.  She builds a good grounding for this novel.  Everything connects and flows well.  A very good mystery that keeps you guessing until the end.

B0090YHSFC|5.0|The game starts out easy like one would expect, but quickly gets more difficult as you progress. It was fun as an overall observation. The game mechanic was the same as fruit ninja or cut the rope, which is fun to time out your swipes.<br /><br />Graphics: 8 of 10<br />Gameplay: 9 of 10<br />Replay: to early to say
0670026182|2.0|I bought this book hoping to cook many dishes with my kids. But most of the dishes were kind of odd and were things most kids would never eat.  Then I read that the author, who is British,  lives in Australia.  She is a photographer not really even a chef. There you have it. The foods are not as commonly eaten here.  The photos were lovely and very cool but not a practical book for me. I sent it back.  Really wanted to like but just couldn't.<br />She should write a design book, that I would keep.

B0070Y46UY|1.0|I was interested in the movie and wanted to read the book before I went to see the movie.<br />It was a V-E-R-Y slow start. I actually love philosophy,but this did not feel like a real person's experience.<br />It is written in the first person but switches between 2 different first person voices which means you must pay very close attention.<br />The ending is very disturbing. I certainly won't go see the movie, and would not recommend the book to anyone.

If you don't know anything about Yemen,this is a place to start.  John and Kate have once again prevailed and the forces of evil have been put down.  How this is accomplished is what makes the whole story interesting.  I highly recommend the Panther to all fans of Nelson DeMille.  Well done!
0316228532|1.0|This is the worst book i have ever read, but i did read it from cover to cover, perhaps to punish myself for buying the book after reading its bad reviews. I shall try to forget it, also forget what it shows about the author, whom i really liked after reading all her Harry Potter books.

B003SNKBXW|4.0|We used this for a book club selection.  I found that it was very slow in starting but picked up in the later chapters.  I actually gained some more knowledge and was fascinated with the writing of Alexandre Dumas, so much so that I read  the Count of Monte Cristo (which I loved).  Whether you like a good mystery or are interested in gaining some history of A. Dumas, this is a worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />I downgraded the rating because I like a full character development and felt that the mystery girl needed more written about her background.  In terms of the book club, it was well received and prompted a great discussion.
B000WCDBKM|4.0|For the Bibliophile who loves Depp!  A quirky but intriguing mystery that is more Aleister Crowley than Hercule Poirot.  What more could you want!
B000O14VAU|4.0|I just watched Underworld for the about the sixth or seventh time today and having watched all four numerous times, knowing the back story as well as I do now between Sofia and Michael, I am able to see so much more the story unfolded. I love the stylish production. When Selene, the female vampire of a coven somewhere near 1700 years old, finds a human and realizes the vampire's arch nemesis, Lucian is alive when she had been told all of her life he was dead (the rules are strict about delving into the past in Selene's world) she very much wants to know what the Lycans want from him. There appears to be nothing particularly different about him but the caretaker of their coven has been anything but vigilant with nightly bawdy parties and a total lack of oversight. This leaves Selene feeling uncomfortable and she senses a terrible danger ahead. Michael played very well by the sexy Scott Speedman, is the center of this story as this faction wants to merge the humans and Lycans biologically which was supposed to create a doubly strong, powerful entity and perhaps stop the thousand year war between these two very different races of beings. I am a great fan of Kate Beckinsale and I think she plays a brilliant part in a sometimes complex, but well directed movie. Bill Nighy, a delightful English actor who has played many wonderful parts plays Viktor, the elder whom Selene feels forced to \\"wake up\\" from his 300 or so year sleep is a viscious charactor who originally put this war in motion when *****SPOILER ALERT***** (for the five of you out there who hasn't yet seen it) he killed his daughter in an extremely barbaric way in the early days when the Lycans (werewolves) are basically used and abused by the vampires as slaves. The story, as I said is not just brilliant, but there is a beautiful love story between Lucian and his vampire wife, Sofia. When she dares get pregnant, Viktor, who is perhaps the very definition of rascism, will never let this hybrid child come to term and kills Sofia as noted above, in front of a chained and horrified Lucian. And so Lucian starts this terrible war.<br /><br />There are four movies in this series. Best watch Underworld: Rise of the Lycans first although it was the third made in the series. Then go back and watch Underworld, Underworld Evolution and then Underworld Awakening although the last movie does not include Scott Speedman, which is sad. These movies are the story of the development of both races and the thrill of living a little bit inside their cruel, dark worlds. I thought I wouldn't like Rise of the Lycans which is set back many years and explains what happened and how these two races became such mortal enemies. But the powerful love story was simply done brilliantly and it is my second favorite in the series.<br /><br />If you haven't indulged in this intelligent, stylish, very goth set of movies yet, I highly recommend you rent and watch or just buy the whole thing in a bundle. I never get tired of the Underworld movies. Definitely NOT for children. This is true \\"adult\\" entertainment. All movies send you on a fantastic thrill ride as the twists and turns just keep coming. Highly entertaining.

B005LAJ17M|5.0|I simply have to review Homeland. I'm sure most reviewers in here have already explained plot and excellence, I just want to add my voice here. I am an admitted TV and movie addict and watch mostly scripted shows. I know that a truly excellent almost historically perfect shows, the very few there are, take a village to make. I also know that for some, luck is part of it. Homeland must have a boatload of the former because it doesn't need the latter. Clare Danes shines brilliantly as Carrie, the bi-polar CIA agent who together with the equally brilliant Damian Lewis as Brody, the Ex-Al Quada prisoner (for eight years) who come together like two run away trains destined for destruction are the heart and soul of this unequalled series. However, the always amazing Mandy Patinkin as Saul, Carrie's biggest advocate and probably parental figure as well as Morena Baccarin, another tremendously talented actor who has finally found a worthy vehicle to stretch in, as Brody's wife, Jessica, deserve highest praise as well for equally brilliant performances. The rest of the village, the other supporting actors, including Brody and Jessica's daughter played by Morgan Saylor who is holding her own at such a young age against the powerhouse of talent that makes Homeland the exceptional thrill ride it is.<br /><br />We are now, I think, about halfway through the second season and it is to the credit of the entire cast and crew, directors, producers, Showrunner(s), camera, lighting, sound, other talented supporting actors and especially the writers, that in my humble opinion, it is better than the first season. Some say it, at times, comes a little too close to soap opera, but I totally disagree. This season could have played it safe and built horizontally upon Season 1. I think this season has seen tremendous growth and growing strength in Carrie. We also are seeing Brody's inevitable struggle with the psychosis developed after his harrowing years as prisoner and resulting brain washing. Every character this season has been realistically allowed to react to the developing crisis we know is looming on the show's horizon. I want to encourage this crew to continue the obvious hard work everyone is putting in to Homeland. I admit that also historically, such shows sometimes give in to playing it safe in the hopes of staying on top. Homeland's greatest strength is allowing it's characters to change and grow in ways most people can relate to. Staying real will bring us many seasons of a show so good, we, the people and not just the arty \\"Intelligentsia\\" benefit with something to look forward to in our sometimes otherwise mundane lives.<br /><br />I want to applaud everyone involved in this series and thank them for the weekly pleasure of having Homeland to look forward to. If you haven't seen this series or have been thinking about buying it and watching it because you don't get Showtime, I would encourage you to get this one, wait until the dregs of winter are upon us and allow this series to take you away with some of the highest quality entertainment offered today. I know money is tight all around these days all too well,  but Homeland is the sole reason I rent Showtime (honest disclosure - Dexter, Shameless - my guilty pleasure, and Nurse Jackie are why I continue through the rest of the year). If you can only afford to buy one series this year - Homeland is at the top of MY list. Everyone I know who watches it are about as big a fan as I am, so I think I can recommend this one without pause. I envy those of you who have not yet seen Homeland. Although this is one I will watch over again, there is nothing like the first time through! Enjoy!ing.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|I really liked this movie. As always, Ridley Scott came through with the visuals, and the story was fun. I liked the whole link to ancient Earth myths.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Charlize Theron has had a couple of very good roles this year.  Here as the evil witch, and in \\"Prometheus\\" as Meredith Vickers.  She's got the villain role down pat, I would say.  And in my opinion, she stole the scenes from Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth in this movie.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie.  Just be forewarned that it's not going to follow the same exact plot as the original tale that you heard as a child.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart plays the main character, Snow White.  Life starts off pretty good for her, being the daughter of the king.  While she was still young, a woman pretending to be a damsel in distress wins over her father's affections.  This woman, Ravenna, weds the king and becomes her stepmother.  Ravenna eventually murders the king and brings in her own army to take control of the castle.  Snow White is sent to confinement and spends much of her childhood in a locked room.  Eventually, she gets out and escapes into the haunted forest.  The Queen sends a reluctant huntsman to track down Snow White.  The Huntsman, who is suffering from personal issues of his own, falls for Snow.<br /><br />Anyway, this show portrays the story a little bit differently from the original story.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  The TV show, 'Once Upon a Time\\", also put their own twists on the Snow White story.  I suppose you have to make the story more appealing to different generations of viewers.  The production and the special effects are top notch.  The costumes and the sets are also well-made.  They are what you would expect from a high-budget movie.  There are plenty of memorable scenes in this movie.  I particularly enjoyed the scenes with Queen Ravenna and her magic mirror.  And the movie wisely took the time to invest in Ravenna's backstory, to give her character more depth.<br /><br />What we did not get much of is the Huntsman's backstory.  We are told that he was married and lost his wife.  Chris Hemsworth was fine for the role.  He pulled it off and carried the part well, in other words.  He was believable.  Kirsten Stewart, ofcourse, was more than capable of playing her role.  Her Snow possess a physical and a martial prowess that the original Snow from the storybook did not have.  Yeah, this is one chick that can kick some butt.  The storybook version was a delicate young woman, not the very capable swordswoman that Stewart portrays here.  The Snow White in this movie is much closer to Ginnifer Godwin's butt-kickin' television version from \\"Once Upon a Time\\".  This ain't your momma's Snow White!pulled it off and carried the part well, in other words.  He was believable.  Kirsten Stewart, ofcourse, was more than capable of playing her role.

B0041KVW2K|3.0|While they sound OK, these LP's could have been the holy grail of Beatles LP's, but using the 2009 remasters as a starting point means they sound pretty much the same as those, maybe a tad better.<br /><br />The bigger problem is the pressings themselves. The first set I got from Amazon contained warped LP's in almost all cases and on top of that many were pressed off-center. Amazon sent a replacement set IMMEDIATELY (good for them!) and I was able to piece together a complete set with a few minor warps/off center records. Still it was a compromise, but I didn't want to go through yet another return/exchange.<br /><br />I have only listed partially to all the LP's but I'm hearing fairly quiet vinyl so far.<br /><br />The box, sleeves, book, etc, are beautiful and mine arrived unharmed even though Amazon's packaging was nothing but a flimsy cardboard box (bad for them!).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good read.  Could not put it down once started.  Look forward to reading more!  Highly recommend it!
B005S9ELM6|5.0|This is a dramatization of a true story.  That's one of the reasons I loved it.  Another is because of fine acting and high tension throughout.<br /><br />In 1980 Iran was exploding.  I remember that era well.  At the time some American diplomats were trapped there.  How they eventually got out with the help of the Canadian embassy is a thrilling story and this film tells it well with just the right amount of intrigue and excitement.<br /><br />Ben Afflick stars in the film as one of the diplomats. He also directed it.  It is a masterful job.<br /><br />I don't go to the movies much but this film is worth seeing.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I did not buy this book from Amazon but from the good old regular bookshop, however I still feel I need to state that this is the worst book in the entire universe. There are amoeba on Mars who can write better books than this..
B004CLYKLI|4.0|My book group read this book and found it interesting, sometimes disturbing, and a fasinating look into another cultural viewpoint in child rearing. Even though the author at times seemed to be overly rigid we all felt that she also had many good points in her approach and seemed to grow and even learn to be more open to her children's views. We had not expected this from the press that she had received.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper satisfies. Kate Morton is masterful. This story describes the unravelling of a mystery in the present day, but flashes back to the past as the story originally unfolded. While the story took place in WWII London, it's not a WWII story. As usual, Morton's characters drive the plot. And what true, lovely characters they are! Morton knows people and while she portrays real people well, she also manages to surprise the reader again and again, allthewhile staying true to those characters.<br />This story starts out a bit slower than her others, but the payoff at the end is well worth your time. It's most like the House at Riverton. Witty. Complex. Best feature: the satisfying sigh you will exhale when you read the final words.<br /><br />Please write another, Ms Morton. I'm waiting. Desperately.

0393343405|5.0|I studied Lucretius in Graduate School in the early 1960s, so this book was a pleasant discovery for me.  The book brought back fond memories while the history of the discovery was mostly new information.  Would recommend it to anyone interested in philosophy or science.  Epicurus, through Lucretius, brings us modern thoughts over 2200 years of past time.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|I really liked this movie. I felt like it was an infusion of the classic Disney flavor into Pixar's sensibilities. It isn't the best thing they've ever done, my personal favorite is probably UP!, but it is a beautiful movie with a very moving story. I feel like it is actually pretty underrated. I think it'll get a lot more popular when people my age start having young kids and introduce them to the movie that way. Young girls are going to embrace Merida pretty hard as a role model as the years go on.
0812992784|1.0|I really, really enjoyed the Moor's Last Sigh. It was a joy to read. So I was excited to hear about Joseph Anton (The Daily Show) and bought the book immediately. I enjoyed the first part, the background of the author, how he came to be who he was. And then came the rest. I had hoped the book would launch into a reasoned critique of freedom of speech versus fanatical fundamentalist religions. Here was an opportunity by someone directly and significantly effected. And to be fair, there is a little of that. But mostly the second part of the book is a diary of Mr Rushdie's day to day experience and complaints about his treatment by the British government which is trying to protect him, terrified literary agents and publishers, and wives and girl friends who don't ever quite measure up to expectations. Good memoirs have lots of juicy anecdotes about imminent people, but this is more like a gossip column, and often times wincingly mean spirited. Then there are the complaints that he doesn't get the same treatment as Margaret Thatcher, ex prime minister. Or that he believes he has more problems than Hamlet. The last straw for me was when after having a fling in Paris with the daughter of a friend he complains that the police need to let him have an honest family life. I'm afraid that if I ever read another Rushdie novel, I will be seeing the writer standing there. Not a pleasant way to enjoy a book.
B003F9G8B8|3.0|I enjoyed the story, but the movie was lacking.  i cannot exactly define it, but i just felt more of story could have been built.  enjoyable none the less.  i would pay to see it again.
0446580848|3.0|I love reading this author, but this book was really tedious.<br /><br />1. I like the character, John Corey, but his wisecracking narrative was way over done here.  EVERYTHING had some follow up wisecrack. Like Groucho Marx on steroids.<br />2. How many different ways and times can you tell the reader how rotten Yemen and the people there are?<br />3. All the above could have been solved if the book was about half as long as it was.  The only action was at the end.  Really boring.<br />4. I did not care for the ending at all.  After all the drama building up to the climax that emphasized how isolated they were in a foreign land with a big vendetta to avenge, suddenly they are back in NY and the book is over 3 pages later.  Indeed, to leave the door open to a sequel, but it was more like he got tired of writing and wanted to end the book.<br /><br />Sure, I'll read his next book, but it will be from the library.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|Khan is one of my favorite singers of all time! When he left, I thought Kamelot was done for good. As a fan, I had been disappointed by the direction the band had taken in the last few albums. They seemed to have lost their way after the smashing success that was Black Halo. Instead of following that footprint, Ghost Opera came out, and though I actually like Ghost Opera, the band was taking on a darker tone and just seemed less happy. Poetry totally alienated me... couldn't even find a semblance of Kamelot in it... And then this was all compounded by Khan leaving.<br /><br />Enter Silverthorn...<br />One of the best metal albums of the year!!  Back to that traditional Kamelot sound! Some of the songs are reminiscent of the Karma era, I also hear some Epica, and definitely Black Halo. I was so skeptical of Tommy filling in these impossibly big shoes, but I have to say that seeing Kamelot live erased all my doubts. Tommy is not only an amazing singer but he is a complete showman. He's awesome at engaging the audience, and his voice is flawless! We only got to hear Sacrimony live, and though I loved it, I don't even think it's the best song on the album.<br /><br />As far as the songs go, I can say that it is an incredibly solid album from beginning to end. The run from Sacrimony to Silverthorn is amazing! Tommy in general sings higher than Khan (meaning stays on the higher register) for most of the songs. In some songs, I can totally picture Khan singing in his lower voice, but I can't say it detracts from the album. Tommy does his best at singing with some of Khan's modulations but he still manages to keep his own sound. It's hard to explain but Kamelot sounds like Kamelot, and Tommy sounds like Khan, but it doesn't come off as an imitation. Tommy has his own voice and sound, but the album still sounds like Kamelot.<br /><br />As far as the Box set goes, worth every penny! What a beautiful release! The book is gorgeous and I love how much was included for such a small price, really. This could have easily been a $30-$40 box set.<br /><br />The only negative comment I have to make about the promotional materials and pics is that they need to stop \\"over-photoshopping\\". Some of the band members barely look like themselves. Most notably Tommy. Seeing him in person you can't help but wonder what they did to him on the band pics.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Just when I thought they couldn't possibly top John Lithgow as the blood-curdling sociopath Trinity Killer from Season 4, here comes Season 5. This 4-disc set is incredible. My wife and I couldn't tear ourselves away, and spent many late nights up for hours glued to the screen. Season 5 is like SVU on steroids: thrilling, enthralling, disgusting, depraved, funny, and very suspenseful in equal measures. EVERY episode ends in a cliff-hanger, which leaves you wanting more.<br />  The performances are superb, especially from Golden-Globe nominee Julia Stiles, who plays torture/rape victim Lumen Pierce, who is trying to heal by helping Dexter hunt down her sadistic cadre of attackers before they can torture and kill any more women. Watching her transformation from shriveling rape victim to beautiful, vengeful warrior over 12 episodes is an absolute joy to behold. She and Dexter are electrifying.<br />  Other honorable mentions: Peter Weller as crooked cop scumbag Frank Liddy trying to uncover Dexter's extracurricular activities.<br />  C.S. Lee as Vince Masuka, absolutely hilarious in his crazy attempts to unravel crime scenes from his own perverted perspective. The scene in the warehouse, where he's investigating one of Lumen and Dexter's own crime scenes, is priceless. You'll laugh till it hurts.<br /><br />  \\"Don't be sorry your Darkness is gone...I'll carry it with mine...\\" -Dexter

B005F9TQ0Q|3.0|Wish it was like songs of old, telling of the trials of mankind in a song, voice does not sound animated, sounds more like boredom and I really love Dylans songs for many years
B0058VB56O|4.0|I'm not sure if it's the mastering or the audio files but these Amazon mp3s are really quiet.  That's the only bad thing about this.
0525958002|5.0|Being a Duran Duran fan I found this read wonderful.  Several books have been released about Duran Duran and their story and you always got left wanting to know more about each member of the band.  I knew about JT's addiction as I got older but didn't really realize when it started and how bad it had gotten.  It was a pleasure to read what was going on in his head, his insecurities and then to feel his peace when he achieved it in life.  I loved the fact that no matter what the drama's may have occurred through out the last 30 years of Duran, he didn't bash or talk about anyone in poor taste.  It is tastefully written and I adored the pictures.  Kudos John for a wonderful incite into your life.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book. Very addictive like a soap opera but with lots of adult situations. Good characters each one plays a supportive role to the main characters. A real page turner. I could stop reading it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book, very hard to put down.It was the first time i had read this author, and i now have bought the second book.
B004G6TD3O|5.0|I remember buying this album back in early 80's. I was a fan of the group, but I didn't care for another live album of theirs.This one had more material, sounded better, and more true to the band. The other album had an orchestra backing, and it just sounded to \\" busy\\". I ended up losing the album in a move, but so happy when I found out I could get it through Amazon in CD! Now I got my memories back with clarity! Keep up the good work! Curt A. (customer for life!)
B008D28HYS|5.0|Nothing bad that I've noticed, larger puzzles can be difficult to navigate on my phone. Highly addictive, like Sudoku but you have a cool picture at the end.

B0097NGUJG|5.0|Boom.<br /><br />Great album.<br /><br />Truth be told, I didn't fall in love with it on the first listen.<br />Or the 2nd...<br />Or even the 3rd...<br />It sorta snuck up on me and said \\"SURPRISE! YOU LOVE THIS!\\"<br /><br />And I do.<br /><br />Great great great album.<br />Buy it and be patient.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|This is my personal opinion.<br />I never heard this band before, I was looking for music and the song \\"Let her go\\" came up, I like the lyrics, the pace and the singer's voice. so Yes a would recommend to listen to the song and see what you think.
B000KFB4PK|3.0|I thought this was cute. My only problem is that nowhere did in see that it is for ages 6 and up. I got it for a little 3-4 year old. I wish the &#34;for ages6+&#34; was shown more clearly. Won't work for the little guy I purchased it for so I will donate it to toys for tots. There are a ton if little mini Lego pieces.

0345541588|4.0|Thirteenth in the Jack Reacher suspense series. This one is back in New York City.<br /><br />My Take<br />Whoa...action, suspense, drama, and guilt. And Reacher is slowing down mentally in this one.<br /><br />Macabre, but the comment did crack me up: Suicide bombers \\"by definition are all first-timers\\".<br /><br />It's all chance in this story. The end game for the terrorists that takes them across so many paths. A lonely woman with a critical job who loves her son.<br /><br />Then there are the supposed good guys. The ones who can do anything they want to you. And you have no recourse. What is happening to our country? How many of our civil liberties are we going to allow the government to grind down into the mud? It's one thing to hear politicians proclaim how they are protecting the citizens. It's another to read how those \\"protections\\" actually affect someone. Christ, it scared and scares me to death! Throwing people in jail simply because they can.<br /><br />Everyone is giving Reacher the runaround. The participants in this are enough to give you the willies.<br /><br />\\"...I felt he was telling the absolute truth. And lying through his teeth. Both at the same time.\\" Man, if that chunk'a text doesn't get your curiosity flaring...<br /><br />Poor Reacher. He's so clueless about modern technology: flash drives, cellphones, cellphone cameras, the Internet, DVDs. Theresa Lee gets all excited about calling up Scotland Yard and, offhandedly, telling her partner to wait 'cause she's on the line with them.<br /><br />Interesting analysis of the types of medals a soldier can earn and the types of situations that make that possible.<br /><br />Oh boy. We really need to stop interfering in other countries. When you think of the jerks the United States has supported in the past---these are just the best known ones!---Osama bin Laden, Pol Pot, Qadaffyi, Idi Amin, Ferdinand Marcos, Deng Xiaoping, Francisco Franco, Noriega, Augusto Pinochet, Papa Doc Duvalier, and Saddam Hussein. WTF??<br /><br />The Story<br />It's strictly chance that Reacher is on this subway with a potential suicide bomber. He's dead if he interferes. He's dead if he doesn't. And sitting around is just not Reacher's style.<br /><br />It's the aftermath that has Reacher digging deeper. Too many people interested in a simple suicide. Too many of the wrong types.<br /><br />Her brother, Jake, wants to let it go, but in the end, he can't. Meanwhile, Reacher is wanted by the feds and the NYPD. He's on the run, hiding from everyone.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Jack Reacher forgets very little from his past career as an extremely successful military policeman for the army. One thing he does remember is the behavioral indications list of a suicide bomber.<br /><br />Detective Theresa Lee just wants to keep her head down and do her job. Just her job. Then she meets Reacher. Detective Docherty is her partner.'<br /><br />Susan Mark is caught between a rock and death; her job is with the human resources department for the U.S. Army. It takes a while, but Reacher finally pieces it together. She's probably better off. Peter is the son who plays football and lives with his father in California. Jacob Mark is her brother and a cop in Jersey. And he doesn't believe she was the type.<br /><br />Congressman John Samson was in the Rangers, then moved to Delta Force, and then Special Forces for a total of seventeen years. Reacher figures sure. Until he checks a few things out. Elspeth Samson is in on pretty much everything about her husband. Springfield, a.k.a., Browning, has been with Samson throughout his military career. Now he's in charge of his political security.<br /><br />Rodriguez, Frlujlov, Mbele, and an unknown passenger who took off were all on the car with Reacher. All things considered, why didn't they intervene?<br /><br />Lila Hoth is a foreign national with many roles and a range of interests. Svetlana Hoth is her mother and claims to have been a Red Army commissar in Afghanistan. The boys from Sure and Certain, Inc. got in way too deep. Leonid is one of the crew.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is red and white as a subway train flashes across with white light framing the vanishing perspective. It's a rush!<br /><br />I think a better title would have been What Goes Around considering all the back-and-forth and the history that came back to bite them. Instead the title sums up politics.

B008NABUU8|5.0|Fun, well designed Physics game. Ran pretty horribly on my Kindle, works great on my SIII. Kept freezing on the Kindle, took forever to load puzzles. Difficulty was fairly easy, but still a challenge.
140053271X|2.0|I've had a nook for almost a year now and I spend all my time trying to download files, renew books from the library (the only lend for two weeks), and mess with files that won't open for whatever reason.  Then I have no time left to actually read anything and I'm left frustrated and annoyed.  E-readers seem great in theory, but are a nightmare in practice.  I guess I can't speak for the kindle, but using our Nook to borrow from libraries has been a total waste of time.  Do yourself a favor and stick to the printed books.  No hassle, you can renew as often as you like via internet at most libraries, and when you buy it you can lend it to your friends, pass it on to your kids, sell it at a garage sale, etc.  All the copyright protection surrounding e-books makes them absolutely a horrible value for the money you spend and a waste of time on top of it all.  And when you leave your e-reader in the taxi, at the restaurant, or some opportunistic thief snatches it when your not looking, you are out $100.  What thief would target your $6 paperback?  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

It doesn't take much effort to click the \\"x\\" in the corner to close and move on. As you progress, you build more complicated machines and it can be very comical to see the results of your creations. We love this one and what's better, it's safe for children.
B0064HJX56|4.0|I enjoyed the first one better but this one is good aswell. I can't wait to download reached and see what the cliff hanger is
0316223239|4.0|This story of a woman held captive in a garden shed turned one-room prison cell and the son she gives birth to while held against her will is one you might want to stick with, despite any misgivings you have at the outset.<br /><br />I generally believe that if you can't get into a book within the first few pages, you should drop it. Yet I violated my own rule by continuing on, despite the fact that I found the child Jack's voice grating and not at all genuine. (Why, if Ma has taught him language and math skills beyond his years has she not taught him the pronoun \\"it\\"? Everything in his universe -- rug, chairs, spoons, bed -- is either a he or a she.) And I tired of the creepy emphasis on Jack's continuing to nurse as a 5-year-old.<br /><br />But, in the end, even though it only takes up only about a third of the book, the captivity was the most interesting part of the book to me. I found it fascinating how Ma turned everyday tasks into educational lessons, created opportunities for physical activity and creativity, and just generally filled up the endless, monotonous days. She has created an entire universe for Jack that is so absorbing he feels no lack of the outside world.<br /><br />The rest of the book was less interesting to me. SPOILER... the escape. Not believable in the least. Are we supposed to believe that Ma's captor has never seen the child, doesn't take the opportunity to look when he has the chance? That he would follow Ma's orders, on which the escape plot hinges? Not likely.<br /><br />Ma and Jack's life in the outside world wasn't as interesting for me, either. I wasn't sure what the point of that part of the book was. Mostly, the author says more about the people who encounter Ma and Jack (the grandparents and their friends, mothers at the playground, TV reporters) than about them. Jack becomes mostly a mouthpiece for the author -- his insights into the adult world are all too knowing for a 5-year-old. (\\"In the world I notice persons are nearly always stressed and have no time.\\" Or, \\"[Parents] call the kids gorgeous and so cute, they make the kids do the thing all over again so they can take a photo, but they don't want to actually play with them, they'd rather drink coffee talking to other adults.\\")<br /><br />Yet, the author's concept is interesting, a horrific adult situation seen through the eyes of a child. I think if the captivity were narrated by the mother, I might not have had the stomach for it. (Jack counts the squeaks of the bed when Old Nick \\"visits\\" Ma... 97 one night. It's too horrible to imagine.) You can't help but feel Jack's affection for his space -- as if he were living inside the cozy bedroom of [[ASIN:0694003611 Goodnight Moon]] instead of a prison cell, and it's disconcerting. The world turned upside down, just as his mother's was.ways stressed and have no time.\\" Or, \\"[Parents] call the kids gorgeous and so cute, they make the kids do the thing all over again so they can take a photo, but they don't want to actually play with them, they'd rather drink coffee talking to other adults.\\")<br /><br />Yet, the author's concept is interesting, a horrific adult situation seen through the eyes of a child.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|Extremely disappointing. Geiger sets were visually stunning, acting was mediocre, but the plot line was a total joke. The prerelease trailer contained scenes that were not in the download version.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a very good book. Steve Jobs was a very unusal man.The book gave a very good discription of his intense ,creative, and excentric life style.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I vowed the last time I read a \\"John Corey\\" novel it would be my last.  Unfortunately, I forgot the vow and ordered this book.  While the story line is interesting, if not gripping, I get very weary of the constant wise cracks by Corey, which tend to distract and are usually not even amusing.  I have not finished the book yet, and may not. I am an avid fan of DeMille, and if he writes a book without Corey as the main character, I will certainly purchase it.
B005544V6A|5.0|As with most tv shows set in a law firm the reality is vastly different from how they protray it.  Not all big firm lawyers are that egotistical, hateful and back-stabbing (at least not where I practice)  And that idea that a lawyer is a litigator one day and handling a merger the next is, of course, nonsense.  But the writers of this series have done what most successful writers do.  They take the time to develop the characters and make you care about them.  I love how they've handled Louis over the first two seasons.  Hope they keep up the good work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app, but it is getting harder and harder to even open it. Once it opens, it is fine, but it takes about five minutes to do that. I like everything it has, the different Bible versions, reading plans, daily verse, I just don't like the slowness.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I definitely prefer Grisham's earlier books such as < The Chamber> or<br /><The Client> whose plot is much simpler but with warm sympathy with<br />the characters, evil or virtuous.  The characters in <The Racketeer > are just pawns in the making of the intricate PLOT which seems to be the author's sales point. over
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This was an OK movie.  Great visual effects but don't expect Oscar winning acting.  Not something I would see at the theater but OK for home viewing.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I LUV IT SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!! It is awesome! Naturally. the best game ever!!! My younger siblings have the best time with this game!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|This a great game. I loved it all. I just hope there's a second game; this one ended too fast
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I have watched this twice so far and loved it even more the second time!<br /><br />Johnny Depp is a master at playing this type of roll - a little droll humor, a lot of fantastic facial expressions and hand mannerisms, as well done as my favorite, Edward Scissorhands.  I'm glad to see Michelle Pfeiffer back in some good rolls too.  She's still as beautiful as ever as she ages!<br /><br />The team of Depp and Tim Burton is hard to beat.  Special effects are great in this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a good part two.  The author was able to keep the story interesting and believable.  I really like the characters and was happy with how the story moved along.  Very good read.
B008458O3S|5.0|Great game. Tutorials are excellent and the games mechanics are well developed and easy to learn. Graphics are simple but fun. Overall, highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book Three was the best one to me. You still get the hot heated scense, but know that theres more to the relationship.
0545101417|5.0|This Audio CD is fantastic. The narrator is perfect. She brings you into the story and I can imagine each character as she leads you through the 2nd book of HungarGames. I can see each character as she changes her voice and what they are going through. Each time I turn the car off I still want more of the story. I can't wait until I get the 3rd book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was happily surprised by how fun and thought provoking these puzzles are.  While working through them I found that both spatial visualization and logic were both skills that were really helpful to guide me along. I also enjoyed how simple the concept is but how challenging it can be to fill up the entire board.<br /><br />This game is perfect for when I want something that is easy to get engrossed in.  It's well designed, but I took away a star because there is no landscape mode for playing the game.  I prefer that orientation for play on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />However, overall I enjoyed the game so much that I will recommend it to others, and I was inspired to write my first review of an app
1451695195|3.0|For the second time this year, I ordered a book which was authored by a medical doctor and which promised to tell of the author's near death experience.  Both books did that, but both were disappointing.<br />  Dr. Alexander's book provides significant detail regarding his personal life and training, as well as a detailed cronology of his familiy's bedside vigil and hardships.  He also explains his rare and nearly fatal disease and its affect on his body and brain.  What he doesn't do well is explain the details of his near death experience.<br />  I understand, as well as a non-experiencier can, how difficult it must be to put into words such an unuaual event.  Apparently, one is taking in information and impressions that far exceed the human ability, and yet, others far less educated than Dr. Alexander have done so more ably. What bothered me the most was the vagueness of his tale.  He stresses that he would be told much while out of body, and yet he relates few specifics. Perhaps it is just my problem.  I have an intense curiosity about the afterlife, and I've alway enjoyed the stories of those who travel there, even briefly.<br />  In summary, the doctor tells a good story, but if you want specifics about a peak into the afterlife, this may not be your cup of tea.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a really well written book.  I really could identify with the characters and the story.  I enjoyed the plot and felt like it was believable.  This is a fresh, sexy and intriguing book.  I read it every moment I could.  I found myself laughing out loud and crying with the characters.  Awesome book!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'm so disappointed that Muse's new stuff is nothing like this album. But that's how it goes.<br />For me, this is probably the best album I have ever heard.<br />Enough said.
B00005U8EM|4.0|Absolutely fascinating movie. I was going as crazy as Bill Murray, and I wasn't even living the repetition! When they started showing such brief moments from each day, and you knew that each day was pretty much identical up until that point (mostly when he was trying to win Andie McDowell's character over and was only managing to learn one new fact about her per day before he messed up and would get slapped), that was when we started to lose track of just how much time was passing. Man I started to feel so bad for him! And he couldn't even go home! What awful luck that this would happen on a day that he was out of town.<br /><br />But then I started to think... what if this happened when you were stuck at home, perhaps with a dead-end job (fast-food maybe), instead of an entire day's worth of free time to make the most of your life? You can't accomplish much when you're stuck behind a counter all day long. On the other hand, with no consequences (how many times did he come back to life?), you could just blow off the day's work to fulfill your life's desires. Hopefully, you do not work too many minimum-wage days in a row without pay (because no one else realizes they are repeating) before this occurs to you.<br /><br />I love a movie that makes me think and analyze life. This rarely happens in comedies. If it does, the movie is intended to be a comedy and falls flat. This movie had quite a few laughs. It definitely had its depressing moments. But it was definitely a comedy, and very inspirational in the end, as the main character learned to make the best use of his life.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Tried to get through it one i read the first chapter. She's not as funny in writing as on tv. Kinda just puts Down whatever she is thinking. Very ADD-ish, changing from topic to topic. sounds like she put it together in a day. Really no substance to it. Too bad because I like her alot. :( disappointed

1451620829|3.0|Being a diehard KISS fan, no way that I was going to pass on giving this one a read.  \\"Makeup To Breakup\\" is the autobiography of Peter Criss, a true original, who was an important part of the history of one of the most famous rock bands that ever existed.  Criss begins his story talking in detail about growing up poor in Brooklyn.  He joined gangs to keep himself safe from getting beaten up.  He got a drum set at an early age, and vowed that he would one day play at Madison Square Garden.  In his early 20's, he answered the infamous ad to become the drummer of the band that would skyrocket him to stardom.<br /><br />Criss makes no bones about his personal opinions on founding KISS members Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, actually spending numerous chapters expressing his anger and extreme frustration toward them for how they treated him during his years in KISS.  To say he paints them in a negative light would be putting it mildly.  He describes how Gene and Paul, two very controlling egomaniacs, constantly looked down on him, and insulted and made fun of him for his lack of education, his drumming tempo issues, not to mention his out-of-control drug usage.  Criss, by his own admission, was very difficult to work with, always throwing drug-induced, foul-mouthed temper tantrums, always threatening to quit the band whenever he didn't get his way.  He was also very promiscuous, bringing hot groupies back to his hotel room after a show to do his thing with them, and then kicking them out, all the while, being a married man.  In some parts of the book, it is hard to decipher what is fact and what is just simply Criss' emotions causing some paranoia and exaggerated points of view.<br /><br />Criss's highly emotional nature can truly be felt while reading the book, as he describes many times throughout how he cried and broke down every time he was crushed or was wronged.  Whether he is describing his experiences with the band, his two failed marriages, his bouts with loneliness or his failed solo career, Criss repeatedly describes how he felt suicidal.  He fluctuates between immense anger, depression, and feelings of betrayal.  In closing, Criss chronicles the reunion tour, his bout with breast cancer, his stint in rehab, and his becoming a man of God.  He gives all the dirt on his thoughts on Gene and Paul, Tommy Thayer, Doc McGhee, his sex life with his first wife Lydia, and how Ace Frehley betrayed him.  Overall, he comes across as being bitter, confused, naïve, and immature at times for a 66 year old man.  Heck, he never learned to even open a checking account and write a check, he always had other people do his work for him.  At times, it's hard for one to feel sorry for him, as many of his problems in his life were brought on himself, yet he often tends to blame others. Bottom Line, KISS is nothing without Peter and Ace, and vice versa, although the breakup was perhaps necessary for all involved.  A good read for the true diehard!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It took me longer to finish this than the first two books.  The story wasn't as interesting and it took to long to get to the climax and tie the story together.  Overall the book is well written but didn't contain the same energy as the other two books.  It's good to finish off the series and it ended nicely.
0440244412|5.0|This is a wonderful adventure.  I enjoyed this world.  But you must read all five books together.  It's one long story with cliffhangers at the end of prior books.  There is a romantic happy ending at the end of book 5.  But the world is still full of problems with a lot of room for sequels for other characters.<br /><br />I wanted more complete answers in this book - especially about characters who died in this book, since sequels probably won't get into that.  There are slow parts and repetition in the last three books.  I think the series would have been better if shortened to three books not five.  But it's still worthwhile and very enjoyable.<br /><br />At the end of book 5 is a deleted sex scene.  I loved it because it is an example of the argumentative relationship between Barrons and Mac.  For them sex is a battlefield.  That is the most magical thing about this series.  Their relationship.<br /><br />I talk more about the author and the series in my review of the first book Darkfever.  I don't want to duplicate things here.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Narrative mode: 1st person (mostly Mac with some Dani).  Story length: 672 pages.  Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words but not often used.  Sexual language: mild in the book (stronger in the deleted scene at the end).  Number of sex scenes: 4 partial, 4 regular, 1 deleted at the end.  Setting: current day Ireland.  Copyright: 2011.  Genre: urban fantasy with romance.<br /><br />THE SERIES:<br />The five books in order are Darkfever, Bloodfever, Faefever, Dreamfever, and Shadowfever.  Book 6 is Iced.  It starts a new series with Dani as the heroine.
B0031J62KE|5.0|I must say, I have heard many people play Chopin, but NO ONE like Alexandre Tharaud.  His musical expression &  delivery is superb, his sensitive expression, of knowing when to hold back and gently caress the listener with the pianissimos, then build up passionately to the crescendos, his intonation and attenuation is absolutely masterful!. I have heard many play Chopin like Rubinstein, and many other famous people however NO ONE delivers Chopin like Alexandre especially in this Journal Intime, which is his own private intimate journal of his favorite Chopin pieces.  These are extremely difficult pieces to play, and what I love in both this CD and in the Chopin Preludes by Alexandre, is that he has chosen many pieces of Chopin that are not so well known by most musical listeners.<br />The pure Genius and artistry of Chopin truly and genuinely shines through flawlessly in Alexandre's masterful musical delivery unlike anything I've ever heard.<br />This made me fall in love with Chopin's music all over again, but in a new and heightened way. Thank you Alexandre. I applaud your genius. I loved both these albums so much I also purchased Alexandre's Bach CD & his Angelico Corelli CD.  J'Adore, merci beaucoup Alexandre for shining this beautiful and precious diamond of classical music and for re-inspiring a new and fresh audience with your Genius.

Collins is so good you really just can't tell until it actually happens. I will definitely continue the series to find out what happens!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like the puzzzle and the prizes. I do think however that the coins should regenerate faster. I hate waiting so long for more coins.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|I like this CD as I do all of Seal's CDs that I have purchased. He is so smooth. A wonderful artist.
0545425115|5.0|Bought this as a gift and found myself reading it first. I would suggest reading even if you saw the movie.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Beautiful production with great acting.  We've seen many versions of this story, and this is the best.  Great family movie.
B005K15XR4|5.0|Perfect music for movie scenes. Almost every track last around 2 minutes, but they are full of passion and emotion. Some tracks have a slow build up, but they all end with intense energy. I think some themes deserve a further development. I really recommend this cd to my friends.
0439023513|3.0|I'm going to be honest, I had to fight to get through this book. If I had been reading it instead of listening to the audio, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it at all. I'm not a fan of war, and that was the basis for this entire book. Although I knew it was coming, I just didn't want to hear about it. Peeta pissed me off for a while too, but I won't spoil it for anyone.<br /><br />However, Suzanne's writing is still amazing which is why I won't bash the book completely. She still has a way with words that kept me in her world and I just had to find out what happened in the end. I would have done a few things differently but all in all, it was okay. I love endings that leave it open for the possibility of another title, but this one didn't have that. I didn't love it, but I didn't completely hate it either.
0307454541|5.0|Although I have the e-book version of this trilogy I bought this one for a friend. She loved it, therefore I loved it.<br />Delivery was prompt. Thanks.
B005MW68RK|5.0|I do not know how I found out about Beth Hart's music, but it has been such a wonderful and pleasant experience. Her talents are not widely known, but that is suitable for me because I can walk around with smugness knowing that not everybody is aware of such great music and a great talent. Now I got to catch up with all the music I had missed before her collabration with Joe Bonamassa, who by the way is an extraordinary talent in his own right, but the mix of his guitar and Beth's vocals gives one a musical treat that lingers for time eternity. It is that good. BTW, Beth's newest just adds to her musical legacy. Just make sure you don't tell anyone about it. Lets keep it our little secret.
B005Q4RF4Y|5.0|My husband studied this book in grammar school way back in the day and has been wanting to reread it as a more mature adult. Shortly after downloading it, he decided he better order another copy of his English version (we can't find the original antique!). He is slowly reading it now alongside the English version and he loves it.
B004ZI0NLO|5.0|[[ASIN:1455805688 River God]] This is an absolutely brilliant read,The first book in the series about  Taita the slave, centred around the times of the pharoahs this book tells the tale of a country in the  turmoil of war,lawlessness and the main characters daily struggle with their lives close to the crown of egypt and how they are  torn for their love of each other. it kept me awake late at nights as it is a hard book to put down once started.<br />love it.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Here's a true story directed by Clint Eastwood that portrays the real LAPD in all their violent and corrupt glory; quite different from the numerous hero-making cop series overloading airtime. Jolie is perfect for the role, one person's struggle against overwhelming odds, fighting for the life of her son.
B0047GNCSU|3.0|Cover<br /><br />This cover isn't something that jumps out at me and screams to be read. I guess it's cute and it makes me want some candy. But I don't really see how it fits with the story line. The only reason it says anything about candy is because of the television show in the book. Why are one of them red? I just don't get it.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />Ugh, I hated every character in this book except for Scarlett. To me, every single one of them was typical Hollywood trash. Fake is the theme running through these characters. You want to like Jane but even when she gets a taste of stardom she jumps on the train to fake town. Maybe not as much as the others, but she's well on her way. They all lacked any kind of depth, but I guess that's to be expected given what the story was about. I loved Scarlett though. She's the only one who really told it like it is and didn't try to put on a game face for the rest of the world.<br /><br />Story<br /><br />I'm going to be honest. The ONLY reason I read this book was because it fit a challenge I participated in this month. And the only reason I own it is because it was two dollars at the Salvation Army. I can't pass up a two dollar book, I don't care what it is. This book is one I never planned on reading. Yes I got through it but that's only because it was a quick read and easy to finish. The story revolves around young rich people living in L. A. who are on a reality show, none of which interests me. If you're into that kind of stuff you would probably love this book. And while I didn't hate it, I doubt I'll ever read the rest in the series. It just didn't have that oomph that I look for in my novels.<br /><br />Quote(s)<br /><br />Again, nothing screamed awesome sauce so much that I had to repeat it. Everything memorable has already been said before.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Suzanne Collins  puts less action and more plot into this book to good effect...<br />That's all I've  got to say...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozer isn't the most intense or exciting, but it passes my time better than many of the other games I have downloaded. I do recomend this game to anyone who just need something to do.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I have read every book from the series and find it fascinating and informative. The history, the science the characters become part of your life. Can't wait for the next book in July!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Alright. Calibration was off so I had to click an inch to the left of everything. I would actually buy full game.
B009GEEMLY|1.0|Don't waste your time.  It's a complete snooze fest.  I'm not sure why people loved it so much.  We didn't make it 2/3 through without turning it off.
0439023483|5.0|Let me start by saying honestly, is there anyone who didn't like this book? I mean c'mon, this thing has blown up like crazy! And I'm going to admit, I wanted nothing to do with it... at first. But then I gave it a chance thanks to Battle Royale which it resembles too much to be a coincidence and I happily report that I'm glad I did. Suzanne Collins rocks! This is one powerful story. There is SO much emotion in this book it's crazy.<br /><br />It's impossible not to love every character. Of course when it comes to the teams I'm going to think outside the box and say Team Effie all the way! Sure I love Peeta and Gayle, but they're still boring. One is a hopeless romantic with his heart on his sleeve, the other has his heart up his you know what. They're great and all but Effie is where my loyalty lies. I would welcome all of the Capitol craziness with open arms. I know, I'm terrible.<br /><br />It takes a LOT for me to get emotional when I'm reading or watching a movie. Seriously, a lot. And while I didn't cry reading or listening to the audio, the movie is definitely going to pull on my heart strings. Just watching the trailer gives me goosebumps, now that's impressive! But really people, stop comparing this series to Twilight and Harry Potter. This is NOT vampires and wizards, it's something that could actually happen in the future which makes it even more intense.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love the HBO show, but the books are even better! I am loving the 3rd novel and cannot wait to get to the fourth in the series!
B0090YHSFC|3.0|Its not a bad game, but not really all that fun either, I got bored after 5 or 6 levels, but kept playing to see if it got better, but it didn't, I played all levels on the first two stages, its just not that fun. Graphics are decent, it installs and loads fine, its an okay game.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I have read every book from the series and find it fascinating and informative. The history, the science the characters become part of your life. Can't wait for the next book in July!

B0096C69F8|5.0|All voices are great, and loved hearing Villazon back in good voice.  If you only get one Don Giovanni, this is a great one to have.
0375869026|5.0|My sister's school recommended that families read this book prior to starting the new, reformatted intermediate middle school this fall. She and my mom read it, and had me read it after them. (I'm 24). It's a wonderful book that all middle schoolers should read. It's about true kindness, friendship and anti-bullying. It was easy for 10-13 year-old's to understand and a great, fast read for adults.<br />My sister has even experienced some not-so-nice friendship lately and they acted like the bully in this book. I asked if her \\"friend\\" read it and I wasn't surprised when she said \\"no\\".<br /><br />Be kinder than necessary.
