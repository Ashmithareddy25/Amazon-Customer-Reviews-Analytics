B008A1TIOK|5.0|Whether out of pure curiosity or out of admiration for the Vivaldi's Four Seasons or because of admiration for Daniel Hope's violin virtuosity - or even perhaps an admirer of Max Richter, this new creation is something that is a `must hear', `must own.'  This is one of the most pleasant surprises of the year - a second look at the famous Vivaldi work that we all know and love. The primary genius behind this venture is new-music maestro Max Richter, a German born British composer who studied composition and piano at University of Edinburgh, the Royal Academy of Music and with Luciano Berio in Florence. After finishing his studies, Richter co-founded the contemporary classical ensemble Piano Circus. He stayed with the group for ten years, commissioning and performing works by Arvo P&auml;rt, Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Julia Wolfe and Steve Reich. And now Richter turns to the past and brings us the well-known Four Seasons with a spring-cleaning.<br /><br />Adding a `prelude' to the original beginning of the work, Richter lets the mood of a shimmering, almost popping out of the bud Spring by juxtaposing electronic and acoustic strings and then gradually after 42 seconds the opening of Vivaldi's work begins.  Daniel Hope is the gifted performer here with the Konzerthaus Kammerorchester Berlin conducted by Andre de Ridder. What happens as we progress through spring and summer and autumn to winter is a sifting through the extraneous portions of these works to simplify and make the solo violin lines more elegant and atmospheric. No, it does not come across as a `Stokowski rethinks Bach' extravaganza - quite the opposite.  This is crystalline pure Vivaldi polished to a fair-thee-well by Richter. According to Richter, `\\"The Four Seasons is something we all carry around with us. It's just everywhere. In a way, we stop being able to hear it. So this project is about reclaiming this music for me personally, by getting inside it and rediscovering it for myself - and taking a new path through a well-known landscape.' The result is full of charm, exquisitely played, and makes the entire sequence of seasons comes refreshingly alive. Grady Harp, November 12hrough a well-known landscape.' The result is full of charm, exquisitely played, and makes the entire sequence of seasons comes refreshingly alive. Grady Harp, November 12
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Ok i liked the book, at some parts you think you are getting access to first hand information always labeled as top secret. The best thing of this book is that you finally know how exactly that terrorist died, and the big coward he will always be
B008PWUWLC|4.0|This works great with my 1st Gen Fire.  There's a lot I like about the case but there is one thing that bugs me and I think it bugs me because my mother used to work as a seamstress.  The seam stitching on the cover-- the bit that can be seen near the edge is a bit wavering. It's not weak or terribly badly done, I just know my mother would have commented with disapproval.<br /><br />Ok, now that is out of the way, the things I like.  I like the understated elegance (without being too formal) of the gray/taupe/light blue color scheme.  Yes, I'm the same person who was delighted with a walking stick with poppies on it, but while there is a certain delight in drawing attention to an accessory that others might want to downplay, I'm not too keen about my Fire looking flashy and noticeable.  Getting mugged for a piece of electronic equipment is not my goal.<br /><br />I had a frustrating few seconds when I first opened it trying to figure out exactly how the Fire fit in it-- the edge near the fold has velcro on it.  Pull it apart, slip the Fire inside with the charging port at the opening provided for it and it's a snug and perfect fit.  While the first couple of times I folded the flap back to use it as a prop it was a bit stiff, this improved with use.  The gripping edge does hold it in a landscape position on every surface I have tried from a varnished wooden table to a glass desk.<br /><br />Recommended.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Even though it may be a well acted period piece as one reviewer said I cannot believe that in the extras that one of the producers said that it had to do with reality and it is beyond me as to why anyone would think that Abraham Lincoln was hunting vampires while he was contending with the Civil War over slavery and even when he was younger (vampires do not exist) it's a rediculous movie even though the action parts were pretty good in some places but vampires and Abe battling each other in a stampede of horses, get out of town, and that goes also for that long scene of the vamps and Abe battling on that train for the silver that was supposed to be on board and wasn't, I'm glad that I only rented it at the library for $1 and didn't waste my time or money going to the theatre to see this load of dribble. I'm really surprised that Tim Burton would associate himself with something like this. He was better when he made Batman with Michael Keaton, I still love the way that the car was designed back then and I understand that the owner of In And Out Burger has that very car sitting in his living room as he bought it after the movie ended it's run in theatres.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another fantastic winner by DeMille. John Corey at his best. The world needs more guys like Corey.  Never want the stories to end.

1878424319|4.0|Bought this as a gift for my daughter who is IMO in need of something like this. She wont get it til xmas but i have looked through it and i like what i have read :)
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|yes I will shar my opinion I will. shar it because I like it a lot l like it because you get to yous your own creativity.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Another absolutely amazing Jack Reacher novel can't wait for the next one wish Lee Child could write a book a week
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I thought this was going to be far better then what it was, but in fact it actually bored me to the point where I started to nod off and fall asleep. There was just not enough of a storyline to hold my interest.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I enjoyed the movie before but it is so much better with Blue Rays. I didn't believe it could be any funnier.  I still feel bad for the Cat.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I have always been a fan of BBC, so I thought that I would probably enjoy this movie because of the great cast. Well, I certainly was not disappointed! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. It has just the right blend of drama, sadness, and comedy and an interesting, colorful setting (India). I thought that the character Sonny (played by Dev Patel) was especially delightful! In my opinion, the entire cast was excellent![[ASIN:B009CPJHY4 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is great book.Once you start it, hard to put down. It compares to fifty shades of gray. Love the characters and can't wait for the third book.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Like most Ridley Scott films, Prometheus is wonderful to look at. It's the holes in the story that become troubling as they accumulate. Many of these flaws have been listed in other reviews, and personally, I could overlook most of them. But a woman running, rappelling, and fighting immediately after abdominal surgery was just a bit hard to believe. Having seen this film twice in the theater, I bought it so I could savor the visual extravagance. I would recommend this film unreservedly to anyone who has seen other Scott films, including Alien and Bladerunner, and enjoys a thought-provoking concept presented in a visually beautiful manner.
B00846REIS|2.0|WAY TOO MANY similarities with Shades of Grey. It would have probably been ok if I hadn't read 50 Shades first.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have had many calculators and came across this one on my kindle...I love it ....the best to use if your a face typed or needing accurate results. has not failed me!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Well...looks ok. people say it's good. But seven dollars is outrageous. That's like totally money laundering.Now ill add a few words to meet the requirement.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|Feeling just like a return to a long lost friend, the Culture is back, maybe in a more mature and considered manner than before (but the micromissiles, combat dislocs and kick-ass avatars are back).<br />If you like the Culture universe, there's nothing not to love here!
B005LAIGIM|3.0|Not Eddie Murphy best work by far. Storyline was cute but nt worth the money. Should have been a made for tv type of movie but great. Family movie
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Good movie, i would say for the older ALIEN fans. Youngsters wouldnt understand! The blue ray 3d is awesome:)<br />I would reccomend this movie!
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I thought this was a good continuation of the maze runner trilogy. What I like about it is the questions that it brings up. Such as ---if your good friend asked you to kill him would you do it? Could you do it?  If giving up your life for research would help save the human race, would you do it? I didn't think that it was quite as good as the first two books. Many questions still unanswered, and the end surely leaves it open for more of the story which I would eagerly read if the author decided to write another book. Now I'm off to listen to the prequel. I have been listening to he audio versions of this series, and I have found the narrator to be quite good and highly recommended!
B00000IQW5|5.0|This is one of the most romantic, moving stories ever. Hunter is awesome, John Goodman is great, Richard Dreyfuss is wonderful. So glad I own it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I love Barbea. These songs are rather special. Love all the tracks. The title track is awesome  Well done Barbra.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Of course, the books are irreplaceable. But this movie was about as close as I could have hoped in conveying the feeling of the first book. I am much looking forward to seeing how well they do with the other two.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|The walking dead is the most original concept for a television show to date and has a fresh story line that will continue to make it a very compelling drama for years to come.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Casino Royale is a thrilling and welcome reboot to a series that's been around for almost 50 years, and a terrific addition to the Bond catalogue. There's no question that Craig has the chops to play Bond; the looks, the stunts, the quips, the charm...it's all here. Bond is actually portrayed as a human being struggling with some issues, instead of a \\"superhero with gadgets\\" that some people have come to see the character as in recent movies. His performance is top notch and here's to hoping he'll continue to play the character in future installments.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I liked it! It brought the Alien movies together for me, and left room for another prequel in the future. If you liked Aliens you should like Prometheus!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This book bordered on boring.  There were far too many obscure medical terms and irrevelant references to wines and archtectural designs.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Time Keeper is yet another masterpiece by Mitch Albom. He happens to be my all-time favorite author and his latest book is a must read. I simply couldn't put down the book and had to read it in one sitting. The essence or meaning of 'time' in our lives has been penned down beautifully. This will surely lead to introspection-lots of it :)
B008XNZMOU|5.0|shipped fast and perfect condition and my girlfriend loves it. plus the gift wrapping option was a very nice touch all in all i am very pleased with the item
0316212377|5.0|Each Culture book is unique.  While sharing a setting, each is written using a completely different approach, which is part of what makes the series so excellent.  And the style and construction of the story always kind of echo something within it.  Excession was the most intense immersion in the Culture itself, and especially Minds.  It's form and style gave some of the feel of how Minds are.  Use of Weapons dealt more with a Special Circumstances associate with a convoluted past, and its form and style reflected that.  Inversions, with just a hint of Culture, reflected the character of deep undercover.<br /><br />It's hard to discuss Hydrogen Sonata for fear of spoiling it.  In fact the moral of the tale is a hall of mirrors about spoilers, really a Hydrogen Sonata of a thing.  If you like the world of the Culture, its great to spend some time there again. The setting gets extended, details are filled in, adventures occur, Minds are witty and good.  There will be a sense of flatness to villain motivation that suits what it must feel like to be part of a civilization about to sublime. But that also kind of produces an effect, highlighting the Minds as more vivid, and the Sublimed life as even more so.  How else are you going to do that?
0525953728|5.0|A good friend recommended this book to me.  Great reading.  The book was one that you could not put down.  The book was a detailed account of the daily lives of SEALS.  I have a much better understanding of what the SEALS do to help protect our country.  God bless them.
B002XTXFU8|4.0|Tom Hardy is great in this movie. If you like Tom you will enjoy him being naked. Great body! This movie is intense but with humor. Definitely a good addition to my movie collection.
0062082353|5.0|One of the greatest accounts of war I've ever read. It feels like your really there. American heros putting themselves in harms way for others.
0143118757|3.0|In a few words what this book is all about, in any negotiation the common sense should always prevail, before you sell or buy anything you must study all the possibilities for good or bad situation.<br />I recommend this book for a young mind !

B002N57KG2|5.0|Always loved this movie a classic when comedy was clean and actually funny.. top that with an all star cast priceless
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Just another review of a military event.  It's time that we stop glamorizing death and destruction and the people involved.  More about the ego of the author than anything else.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Should not be so much.it is free on the iphone do why not the kindil.  I can not buy it is to much.  PLEASE READ
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Bible apps is so good and you can find any verse in it and you do not have to bring and book and its book in a table and you find anything you want to found and i like so much . and i use it all the time . for church .

B008HK3XKO|1.0|I purchased this case for my kindle fire but I am unable to use it as a stand because whenever I watch movies my Kindle fire hd overheats and shuts off until it cools off. This has happened on all three movies I have attempted to watch while using this case. I would recommend going with a different brand.
0062202081|5.0|My daughter is a HUGE Bieber fan and she loves this book. I think she has read it at least 3 times. Good pictures and nicely put together.
B001RHOJSE|5.0|I had just read \\"Hunting Eichmann\\" by Neal Bascomb. [[ASIN:0547248024 Hunting Eichmann: How a Band of Survivors and a Young Spy Agency Chased Down the World's Most Notorious Nazi]] \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem\\" is a chilling sequel.  It is chilling because of the details you learn about how the Germans handled the \\"Jewish problem\\" in the 1930's and 40's.  The book is instructive in just the way the title suggests - how a society can take the murdering of millions of people to the banal, the administrative and the ordinary.  Hannah Arendt is exacting and detailed. She is a gifted journalist and an insightful philosopher. Unlike many journalists and philosophers of the day, she is absolutely committed to the truth. You must read this book if you wonder how the death camps could have happened.  How could the thousands of people who were complicit have complied?  How could this \\"project\\" have been so unbelievably effective? (!!)  Arendt takes the reader through the political climate surrounding the trial, the testimony at the trial, Eichmann's own mental machinations, and the euphemisms that were employed to \\"explain\\" the actions of the Third Reich.  Witness an exchange during the trial:<br /><br />Judge: \\"Dr Servatius, I assume you made a slip of the tongue when you said that killing by gas was a medical matter.\\" To which Servatius replied: \\"It was indeed a medical matter since it was prepared by physicians, it was a matter of killing, and killing, too, is a medical matter.\\"<br /><br />There is much to learn in this small book about how the extermination was organized (with the assistance of Jewish Judenrate) and how the trial was conducted.  Arendt is intensely objective in her coverage, and for that she has been criticized for being anti-Jew, or pro-Eichmann.  Neither of these is the case at all! Arendt's disinterested coverage of the trial, its circumsances and its outcome, gives the reader a \\"fresh\\" look at that era and the best possible insight into how this monstrosity unfolded, and how it all too easily could unfold again.unfolded, and how it all too easily could unfold again.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I just started playing dragon story and I can't stop playing . it is like taking care of a pet you feed it and watch them grow. I would recommended this game.

B009VSW15Y|5.0|So far so good on my Kindle Fire HD.  I've only taken a few pictures but they went right to my picture folder and I was able to email one without any trouble.  The pictures are as good as can be expected without a flash.  It won't replace my Nikon but is a nice addition to my Kindle.
0307593525|5.0|This double set of cookbooks is perhaps the best set of specialty cookbooks I've come across and I have an extememly expansive collection to compair them too.  I have heard complaints that this set is to detailed and to wordy.  However, they do teach you how to master this art.  And yes, French Cooking is an art not easily mastered.  We have been able to learn the recipies and  a number of the techniques that truely help in the preparation of food from any recipe.  Each recipe we have tried is absolutley delicious!!! This set is was worth every penny and more. I hope you enjoy it as much as we have. Our favorites so far are the 3 recipes needed to make the Boeuf Bourguignon.  We used a  Beaujolais wine.  Fantastic choice.  Enjoy.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|Finally, these superb performances get the exquisite treatment they deserved! You really can hear the difference. As you know, with some remasterings - you end up asking - where's the difference? Yet here, if you know this music - you'll hear a huge difference. The occasional muddiness of the original recording is gone! Carl's drumming is so crisp & punchy. Keith's piano is so much more articulate in this rendering - You'll hear things you never heard before.<br /><br />And can I just say the obvious - Thank God for great music like this. It's so rare these days. ELP knew how to do it - and they did it so right! I still think this is their best work. Not one track slacks. It kicks your butt from beginning to end!
B0009XT8YW|5.0|I have had this album in vinyl for many years and have always enjoyed hearing it.  I'm very pleased with the DualDisc since I can see the artists performing on stage.  Great idea:  two in one!

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is full of plot twists and secrets that are revealed slowly, over time.  Nick and Amy Dunne are married to each other, but do they really know one another? It appears that Nick has killed his wife, the evidence is building up that he's done it...then there are the diary entries by Amy that reveal a scary undercurrent to their entire relationship.  What is the truth?<br /><br />It is a twisted and disturbing path that they are on, but I enjoyed the journey.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Funny. I started reading it and this took place my senior year in high school. The imagery took me back and made me connect. A great coming of age piece.

B006BGZJJ4|4.0|First of all, I would like to thank Amazon by attending to my concern at once and subsequently replacing my defective battery charger.  Since the latter was no longer available, it was replaced with this Micro USB Cable plus a PowerFast.  The two items put together is the replacement for my old battery charger.  With the arrival of the two items, I was back to reading my ebooks from my Kindle Fire instead of reading them from my laptop.

B004XQX4K0|1.0|Somehow you should be able to take the content of a book and translate it into code to enter on your machine. So far I have not found a good book in this regard for javacript, and this one is no exception. Code snippets are not much use if you can't use them. The downloadable code is not usable either, it is just exactly what is in the book. Sorry for the poor review, maybe I am too dumb for such a high-minded author.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Nice colorful graphics with no glitches. A bit too easy, would have loved more challenges. Thank you Bootant for not requiring any permissions! I recommend this game for any kindle user.

B008I34ZFW|4.0|As I said \\"Nazi's from the moon who would've thought that!\\" But I must say the producer hit on an original idea and in todays lack of creative vision and sequels to sequels it was refreshing!<br />The move was visually well produced and an element of comedy, even though had something similar took place now our military's space technology would not be prepared for such a response since our current President and Government choose to look at space budgets as \\"unnecessary\\"expenditures even in light of all the practical everyday eart-bound comforts we gain from Space-bourn experimentation and exploration<br />But overall a very good movie!
B008LSVLGU|4.0|First, note that Amazon has this mis-labeled; the cover photo is correct.  It's 18 Classic Albums, not 8 Classic Albums.  It's a box with 10 CDs, each in separate sleeves, containing the music from 18 Jimmy Smith LPs.<br /><br />Second, 4 of the 10 CDs (8 of the original albums) are exactly the same as the \\"8 Classic Albums, Vol. 2\\" by Jimmy Smith.  So, don't buy the \\"Vol. 2\\" if you're going to buy this set.<br /><br />Music & quality is fine, just like all the other \\"8 Classic Albums\\" sets.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|... and on a sliding scale of all the \\"Alien\\" films, a solid \\"A\\".<br /><br />Since my opinion of this film is favorable, I read many of the low-star reviews posted on Amazon.com to get a sense of what the complaints were among those who were less than impressed.<br /><br />I agree with the nay-sayers that the viewer must overlook stereotypical characterizations and the outright illogical - if not stupid - decisions the crew of the Prometheus make over the course of this movie. However, some of those same critical observations can also be directed at \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Star Wars\\", or even 1979's \\"Alien\\", all considered by most to be worthwhile movies, if not sci-fi classics. And much of what made those films great is what makes \\"Prometheus\\" rate my four stars... it is visually spectacular and terrifying.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" returns to the dark, Geiger-esque set design that made the original so appealing and it surprises viewers with extra-terrestrials not seen in the earlier offerings. The plot, though often predictable, revolves around seeking the origin of humans as a species and man's quest for eternal life. This \\"Alien\\" prequel takes place in the not-too-distant future, from 2089 on planet Earth until New Year's Day, 2094, on LV-223, the moon of a distant planet. The effects and cinematography are superb. And director Ridley Scott once again succeeds in making the viewer feel the fear and isolation of the hostile environment experienced by the crew of the scientific vessel. In the movie \\"Alien\\", the tag line was \\"In space, no one can hear you scream.\\" That line is still appropriate in \\"Prometheus\\".<br /><br />If I had to point out weak points of this film, it would be the dialogue and sound. I initially saw Prometheus at the theater, which is where it was intended to be viewed. Obviously you lose much in the transfer to the smaller screen. However, because of the sometimes pressured dialogue, I gained more from the movie plot-wise after watching it again on DVD (it doesn't hurt to have the closed caption feature on or the remote close by). If you can get past this, the rest should be a breeze.<br /><br />If you are an uber-critic of films you will definitely be disappointed. To the perfectionist viewer, \\"Prometheus\\" will be easy to pick apart. And no one will will be nominated for an Oscar here (althought there are good performances, especially and not surprisingly from Charlize Theron). As far as the same old, same old is concerned, there are the traditional creatures from the 1979 film, as well as a Ripley-like heroine, an android, a cavernous spacecraft, a corporate CEO heavy, and the oft-repeated stereotypical crew of both the good and the not so good. However, the movie is not silly or ridiculous and the suspense goes a long way in covering up most mistakes. The mapping \\"pups\\" are very cool, as are the new ET's. Especially impressive to me was the 5 minute or so lead-up to the opening title.<br /><br />Since I've yet to see the perfect film and in spite it's flaws, \\"Prometheus\\" has earned my praise and recommendation. It is a fun film, not a documentary. It is meant to be entertaining, not informative. So to the folks who choose to use a critical eye in determining the quality of this movie by faulting the characters for blindly putting themselves in harm's way or in the roles so often recycled in similar sci-fi thrillers, I say lighten up. It's just a movie. A good scarey movie.<br /><br />And without giving too much away, the end leaves plenty of room for a sequel.in on DVD (it doesn't hurt to have the closed caption feature on or the remote close by). If you can get past this, the rest should be a breeze.<br /><br />If you are an uber-critic of films you will definitely be disappointed. To the perfectionist viewer, \\"Prometheus\\" will be easy to pick apart. And no one will will be nominated for an Oscar here (althought there are good performances, especially and not surprisingly from Charlize Theron). As far as the same old, same old is concerned, there are the traditional creatures from the 1979 film, as well as a Ripley-like heroine, an android, a cavernous spacecraft, a corporate CEO heavy, and the oft-repeated stereotypical crew of both the good and the not so good. However, the movie is not silly or ridiculous and the suspense goes a long way in covering up most mistakes. The mapping \\"pups\\" are very cool, as are the new ET's. Especially impressive to me was the 5 minute or so lead-up to the opening title.<br /><br />Since I've yet to see the perfect film and in spite it's flaws, \\"Prometheus\\" has earned my praise and recommendation. It is a fun film, not a documentary. It is meant to be entertaining, not informative. So to the folks who choose to use a critical eye in determining the quality of this movie by faulting the characters for blindly putting themselves in harm's way or in the roles so often recycled in similar sci-fi thrillers, I say lighten up. It's just a movie. A good scarey movie.<br /><br />And without giving too much away, the end leaves plenty of room for a sequel.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Loved it.  best one yet.  Couldn't put it down<br />  And the humor was priceless.  Can't wait for the next one.
B009AMAM9S|4.0|Having not read the book \\"Cloud Atlas\\", my opinion is untainted by impressions of the often-times superior novel.<br /><br />The story as presented was a little confusing, edging ever so closely to tedious... a miriad of tales, seemingly disconnected and spanning centuries, involving cultures and places both familiar and foreign. But what made the journey comfortable was great acting, superb sound, scenery and cinematography, and the effects. I am predicting more than one nomination come Oscar time.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is truly a feast for the senses. It's not so much a film as it is an experience... something not only to be seen but felt.<br /><br />A good gauge as to the entertainment value of this film is the fact that despite the confusion I felt in not really knowing where the story was leading me, I remained riveted for the nearly 3 hours and barely moved in my seat. I guess what may best illustrate this is taking a cross-country train trip versus flying. It takes longer to reach the final destination, but the scenery makes it well worth the time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Appreciated this story that was told from the warrior's perspective.  I believe we, as Americans, have become so desensitized to the things of war that we have forgotten the sacrifice that is made every day in our behalf.  To me, the book was written as though the author was in the room recounting the events; simply written but got the point across.
B008C20TDG|4.0|This book was very easy to read and linked ideas well, essentially it is an elimination diet to begin the process of reversing many of the common ills brought to us by the modern food chain. If you have read the books of Gary Taubes, and follow Mark Sissons daily apple blog none of this is going to be new news, but as a \\"how to\\" it certainly makes getting started easy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I first saw the title, \\"Wool.\\" Let me say that I was pleasantly surprised and now count myself a fan. It has been a few weeks since I finished the five volumes and the characters and situation have stayed with me.<br />This is a post-apocalyptic series in which the people live in underground silos. The outside world is dangerous and mysterious but life inside is fraught with danger as well. I feel the work is well thoughtout in terms of how humans would survive in such an enviroment and how they would react.<br />While I believe readers will enjoy this as much as I did I caution you to not become overly attached to any particular character. Having said that, I urge you to pick up the book (or Kindle), sit back, relax and enjoy!

B002BSHWUU|1.0|Beatles fans, throw away your garbage stereo CDs.  Instead, buy the mono box!  THIS is how you want to hear the Beatles!  Let me tell you why.<br /><br />1.  These are the mixes the boys worked on diligently with George Martin and approved.  When they were happy with the mixes, they left the studio and left George (Martin) to do the stereo mixes himself.  Believing they would have a very limited market, George did a quick and amateurish job, and it shows.  Some of the stereo mixes have goofs and quirks not heard in these mono mixes; I could point out dozens of infelicities and problems with these stereo mixes; places where the mono mixes are clearly superior.  (Those in the know will know exactly what I mean when I say \\"was in vain...\\")<br /><br />2.  The sound is actually better!  The voices are more \\"forward,\\" the drums are tighter, and the overall sound is more hard rock \\"in your face\\" (more \\"John\\") when compared with the stereo mixes, which are more distant and more mellow-sounding (more \\"Paul\\").  Even if you combine the channels on the stereo mixes to create a \\"fold down\\" mono version, it will not have the punch and presence that these mono mixes have.  In these, the sound is nicely centered with some spread, not like many of the \\"stereo\\" mixes which actually put mono sounds at the extreme edges of the sound stage.<br /><br />3.  The stereo mixes themselves are just bad.  As has been pointed out elsewhere, the first few albums were recorded on just 2 discrete tracks.  In those early days of stereo, they hadn't yet figured out the concept of just hanging two mics in front of the band and capturing a nice broad stereo soundscape.  Stereo was still a gimmick and a novelty, and the (misguided) object was to have a different, discrete sound coming from each speaker.  What we get with those stereo mixes is vocals ONLY in MONO coming from one speaker, and instrumentals in MONO from the other, with NOTHING between!  That's 2 channel sound, but it's NOT stereo.  Interesting in concept but total FAIL in execution.  Those 60's twisters might have been amused and entertained briefly by this at parties, as they stood next to one speaker with drums and guitar coming out of it and hearing the singers coming from the speaker across the room, but it is NO WAY to listen to a band!  (Just listen with headphones--you will soon rip them off and stomp on them!)<br /><br />For the next several albums, in which multi-track machines were finally being used, we still do not have a true stereo image.  Now we have the same two mono tracks at the extreme ends of the soundstage, with an additional track stuck smack in the middle.  Even in the final albums through Abbey Road, elements of the songs were still being recorded separately on separate tracks, at different times--drums on one track, vocals on another, backing vocals on a third, guitars on a fourth, other miscellaneous overdubs (piano, organ, cowbell, tambourine, whatever) on yet another track.  But they forgot one key thing:  They didn't start with a true 2-channel stereo recording of the band!  All that was done was to take these various MONO sound sources (tracks) and insert them into the stereo spectrum at different locations.<br /><br />This is difficult to describe, but listen to (for example) stereo Rubber Soul or Magical Mystery Tour with headphones.  You'll never hear a good stereo representation of the band, just a collection of several separate (and separated) mono sounds, placed at various spots across the stereo spectrum, that never manage to blend into a cohesive sound of a band.<br /><br />(Pardon me while I digress.  Keep in mind that stereo sound, for years touted as \\"3-dimensional sound!\\" is actually only creating ONE sonic dimension, specifically a straight line between the left speaker and the right speaker, or between your left ear and your right ear.  It would take at least 3 speakers, and ideally \\"quad sound,\\" that famously failed 4-speaker experiment of the 80s, to provide 2 dimensions, specifically the plane defined by those 3 or 4 speakers [and assuming you place your head in the center of that plane].  True 3-dimensional sound would require a minimum of 5 speakers; the 3 afore-mentioned planar speakers plus one above and one below the listener.  In a truly perfect world, 3-dimensional sound would be created by 8 speakers:  one in each corner of a cube-shaped room, which would allow individual sounds to be sonically placed anywhere within that room, assuming the recording was done with 8 mics, to 8 tracks.  This would be an awesome effect; much better than today's so-called \\"surround sound.\\"  You could literally sit in the middle of the band, or the Berlin Philharmonic for that matter.  When it happens, remember you heard it here first.)<br /><br />Back to the Beatles.  It would have been easy to start with a decent 2-channel stereo recording of the band with decent spread and separation, and THEN overlay all the mono overdubs (which do of course add essential details to the music) as desired.  The results would have been infinitely more satisfying than the gimmicky \\"stereo\\" of 1960s pop music we get.<br /><br />By contrast, the mono mixes are all front-and-center, with plenty of detail.  They sound like a BAND, all playing together!  The stereo mixes sound like 5 or 6 people playing in separate rooms, recorded separately, with each mono recording spliced into the stereo spectrum somewhere.<br /><br />Trust me, if you seriously love this music, which is arguably some of the finest music created in the 20th century, get it in the best sounding format, in the mixes completed and approved by the Beatles themselves!  Don't be fooled by reviewers who pop the stereo discs in their players and write 5-star reviews without truly studying and understanding the differences between the mixes.  Anyone who seriously studies this music and really LISTENS and compares will come to the same conclusions I have.  (I will point out merely to underscore my credibility:  I own and have studied all of the original US Capitol LP (vinyl, baby!) releases in both stereo and mono, the 2 Capitol CD box sets [wish they'd issue volume 3!], the stereo and mono UK LP boxes from the 1980s [beautiful sets, BTW], the singles collection and EP sets (7\\" vinyl) from the same era, all of the original UK CD reissues [there was a reason the first few CDs in this historic reissue were released in mono!], and, of course,  the new remastered stereo and mono CD box sets.)  Obsessive? Absolutely, but I hope it gives these words credence, and that you take my advice.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Oh, I haven't even mentioned the packaging, which is of course a secondary concern, but the mono box, with each cardboard sleeve duplicating the original LP cover, is so much classier than this stereo box!

B003D585E2|5.0|1959 may have been the year that changed jazz, but this 1957 album made that year a great one, as well as becoming Art's legacy.<br /><br />Stories about the session abound and the version related by Eric C. Sedensky in his April 13, 2011 review is probably as accurate as any. There is short mention in [[ASIN:0306805588 Straight Life: The Story Of Art Pepper]] that appears to corroborate it.<br /><br />As interesting as the background is, it's the music on this album that makes it special. Part of the magic is the 'rhythm section', which was comprised of Red Garland, Paul Chambers and Philly Joe Jones - the latter two were undisputed icons whose names are revered today. I happen to love Red Garland's style although claiming him to be an icon would be inviting arguments.<br /><br />The other part of the magic of this album is Art himself. He developed his own sound and resisted changing or modifying it when Charlie Parker managed to influence not only every alto player, but every musician who heard him. It's Art's style that makes this album stand out.<br /><br />When I review an album that has sound samples on the product page I tend to avoid discussing the music and encourage potential buyers to let their ears decide whether or not the album is one they would enjoy. However, in this case I am so taken with the music that I feel compelled to comment on a few tracks. First is Jazz Me Blues, which is a 1921 composition by Tom Delaney. Bix Beiderbecke's 1924 recording of this song is probably the best rendition. Art's performance of the song on this album comes in a close second in my opinion because he is as inventive as Bix was - a mark of Art's genius.  I also loved Waltz Me Blues, which Art co-wrote with Paul Chambers. In fact, as a drummer I was so taken with Philly Joe Jones' brushwork on that track that I've spent hours studying it.<br /><br />If you've listened to the sound samples and are ready to purchase this album, hold off until you've checked out [[ASIN:B003GE69O8 Kind of Pepper]]. This ten disc set includes this album (the first disc in the set), plus nine more. Among the other nine albums are recordings chronicling Art's career from 1952 to 1959. If you purchase this set from one of the third party sellers here the cost is close to the price of this album.<br /><br />Regardless of how you purchase this album, I highly recommend it regardless of whether you are an Art Pepper fan or just love jazz from the golden era of the 1950s.003GE69O8 Kind of Pepper]].

0449000729|5.0|As published on my blog:  victoriasreadingalcove.wordpress.com<br /><br />Some unknown years ago I managed to acquire a copy of a rather large book (1056 pages) entitled \\"Sarum.\\"  At the time I wasn't really drawn to the types of historical fiction that started with the first cooling rock.  Rutherfurd changed that opinion forever.<br /><br />The book is written about Salisbury, England and starts not quite at the first cooling rock, but at least at the point that England, destined to become an empire, becomes an island.  What I found intriguing about Rutherfurd is his ability to tell fiction through the eyes of the man and woman on the street (or around the fire).  Yes, all the events and dates we learned in world history are there, but they happen in the parlors and dining rooms, shops and farmhouses of the people of each age.  He is able to engage the reader with each turn of events by building his story using five families whose personality and physical traits seem to follow them throughout history; even as their fortunes change.<br /><br />I also found his interpretations and presentations fascinating.  One bit of story line starts with an ancient hunter/gatherer who carves a stone into a representation of his beloved wife.  This bit of carving is found during the building of the great cathedral by a worker.  Thinking that it was a precious idol from some ancient ancestor, the worker hides it high in the superstructure of the church where he is working.  A love note from the distance past preserved in a monument ostensibly constructed for love of God in the distance future.  Almost poetic, don't you think?<br /><br />Another sequence I found delightful was the great debate over whether or not women have souls as well as the spiritual struggle of many when England began the transition from Catholic to Protestant doctrine.  Rutherfurd describes the heart-rending decisions of a populace well saturated in the teaching of a Roman church taking the first steps towarda different religious practice.  Is one sure to earn eternal damnation if one accepts the Eucharist from the hand of a priest NOT ordained by Rome?  Is it sacrilege to accept the Eucharist from a man who does not believe in transubstantiation; a belief that the wine literally turns into the blood of Christ, the bread into his body?  This argument is again played out in living rooms, dining rooms, and the thoughts of the characters.<br /><br />Some would say that the book can come across as an anthology of sorts rather than a cohesive tale.  I think that Rutherfurd chose what, for him and many others, were the defining points of the place of his birth and wove them into story lines of the many generations, sometime with short vignettes, sometimes with well developed tales.  This somehow echoes the amount of information we have for each era.  He covers such things as the construction of Stonehenge, the building of the Cathedral, the arrival, departure and absorption of England's many conquerors, royal marriages, World War II, the Reformation, the Black Death and many more momentous and forgotten moments of English history.  To cover this much territory with any sense of consistency is quite a challenge.  I believe the challenge is well met.<br /><br />Meticulous in his research, skilled in his story-telling, you will find this author will walk you through the streets of Salisbury throughout its long history of else-when.  Say hello to folks when you visit.

0307719219|1.0|The book is extremely flattering about the West, especially the United States.  Whenever the book discusses examples of \\"good\\" countries it always mentions the West.  Yes, the West was relatively successful in the 19th and 20th centuries.  But the world has moved on and today's West is full of failed or semi-failed states.<br /><br />China, one of the most successful economies, got only a few pages of criticism, and the book sounds like a broken tape recorder - human rights, democracy, pluralistic society, blah, blah.  Singapore, which given its very limited land and population, is probably the most successful economy and the best run country, was not mentioned in the book at all.<br /><br />There is even a chapter called \\"You Cannot Engineer Prosperity\\".  That is total BS because in the past half century, Asia's enormous prosperity was made possible by none other than economic planning and social engineering.<br /><br />Do not waste your time.  If you want to understand economic development, I would recommend \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\" by David Landes.

With him, she has a son, and they find themselves on the throne after multiple intrigues and escaping her sister, Isabel and her husband, both of whom have tried to use her as a pawn.<br /><br />I always forget how much I adore Philippa Gregory's work until I pick up one of her books.  This story about Anne Neville doesn't disappoint.  Anne was aunt and guardian of the princes who later turned up dead in the Tower of London and I think her sister's story will be told next and it will be interesting to see how Isabel's point of view relates these same stories.  I always end up pulling out the family tree to get the background on these characters and how they are so interrelated.  I think this one will even appeal to teen readers since the main characters are teens.
B008VBYN80|4.0|fun game. I don't care for the energy bar that depletes after EVERYTHING u do. but other than that its pretty good.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Always satisfied with yahoo mail. Love the app. Quick easy access and easy to navigate. No issues and no complaints.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|BRILLIANT movie.  I am amazed that I haven't heard more about this film as it was brilliant.  Did I say it was brilliant?  Brilliant.  Nolte is one of my favorite actors, now I have another favorite role of his.  The other actors are less familiar, but damn, they were perfect.  Grueling fight sequences at the end.  Other reviews will be much more detailed and informative.  I just loved this movie.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I wanted an multi-alarm that would wake me up to a music playlist. This does that. I also like that I can control the duration of the actual allarm noise. Never had any problems with the app. Been using it for years on multiple devices. I have tried others but they were not as good.
B007THA4FI|5.0|After reading the Harry Potter series, this was such a chane, and she is an amazing writer, I always knew tat, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|I enjoyed this terminator series reboot, very gritty and in general good action scenes.  Plot was a little weak and the terminator actor could have done better but I suppose its probably tough to try and act as a machine :)
0547564651|5.0|Everyone will take away something different from this book: parenting advice, strategies for education reform, a sobering look at current state of education in the US, the effects of poverty on education, as well as a discussion on the pitfalls of the ever so popular intelligence testing (SAT's, etc) methodologies. If that sounds like a lot to cover in one book... it is, but it is nonetheless a great read for everyone.<br /><br />At the core, the premise of the book is that our obsession with standardized testing has obscured the important observation that non-cognitive skills and character traits, which we develop in the early age, can make all the difference in the long run. In fact, let's take it further: what if our schools focused more on helping children develop these traits? Why aren't they? The ultimate goal for any school should not be to teach all there is to know (that is impossible), but instead to teach you all the skills to enable you to continue learning on your own (and inspire you to do so). That's not academic aptitude, as measured by a test, that is character and a life-long life skill.
B00004U8P9|5.0|i ordered this in time for halloween and the delivery was speedy!  i remembering watching this movie live in college and loving it...and this dvd delivered the same!  i especially love the special features of crowd behavior and talk back!  love it and would recommend to strange movie buffs everywhere!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is my favorite book of all time. I really wish Suzanne would write a fourth book about hunger games for capitol children. Well done Suzanne. But beetee  should've died:P hahahaha
B009QW7HMC|5.0|We have watched this show from the beginning and we are addicted to it! The cast is remarkable! The writers for the show are so talented! Every episode is a \\"nail biter\\" & they make it seem so real! This is definitely one of the best shows on TV. Thanks so much to DISH & AMC for coming to agreement for your customers!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is so helpful for getting through any situation because there's a little bit of Charlie in all of us, or Patrick or Sam. I laughed, I cried, but I also realized that feeling infinite is really what we should all look for in life.
0316228532|2.0|I will preface this by saying I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan.  I grew up with Harry Potter and love it even more as a young adult.  I was excited to read this book, even knowing it was not about Hogwarts.  I was disappointed, but NOT because it isn't another Harry Potter.  The book is very dark and really a huge downer.  Harry Potter was often times dark and dealt with death.  However, the Harry Potter novels remained hopeful.  There was a light at the end of a tunnel and a continuing belief in the ultimate goodness in people.  I did not find any kind of hope in the Casual Vacancy and this is what bothered me the most.  Also, Harry Potter is full of memorable, likeable characters.  I did not find any of the characters here very likable.  A few I felt very sorry for (Krystal, Sukhvindar) but there were none I was really rooting for.  Most of the characters were desperately selfish and almost pitiful (like Samantha, Gavin).  All this said, Rowling is a tremendous writer.  Despite my dislike of the characters, I finished the book and found parts of it compelling.  I will qualify all this by saying I don't really read \\"sad\\" novels.  If that's your thing, you might like this.  I felt very blue after finishing the book.  I like novels that leave me feeling uplifted or hopeful.  I won't be re-reading this one.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|I have to start with some background:  I have been a Heinlein fan for over thirty years, and have read every single story he published.  Although I recognize the flaws in Heinlein's works, especially the later ones, he is my favorite SF author of all time.  And the most important reason: his style of writing scientifically plausible SF in a non-technical way, focusing on characters and relationships, has never been equaled.<br /><br />I am also a big fan of Joe Haldeman's The Forever War, although I did not read it until recently.  I have no idea how I missed such a fine novel for so many years!  Thankfully that has been remedied.<br /><br />So you can imagine that when I learned that Scalzi was being touted as the \\"modern Heinlein\\", and that this book was also being compared to Haldeman's novel, I was both intrigued and initially skeptical.<br /><br />I can now predict with confidence that if you are fans of the above authors, you will likely enjoy this novel as much as I did.<br /><br />Scalzi presents technically intriguing technology, without being \\"jargon-y\\" like so much hard SF can be.  He postulates a realistic yet remarkable evolution of human society, where Earth is one isolated place and the rest of humanity seems to have \\"moved on.\\"  His characters are believable, well-rounded individuals that you can identify with.<br /><br />Scalzi also seems to have the same excellent understanding of life in the military as Heinlein - ordinary people faced with extreme situations who \\"do their best\\", some succeeding and some failing.  This is rare in SF these days; many authors seem to lack any knowledge of how military organizations work.  And, refreshingly, Scalzi does not preach political theories at his readers the way RAH often did.<br /><br />The only flaw I can point out, and the reason I give it four stars instead of five, is that the dialogue occasionally feels a bit juvenile even though the characters are most definitely mature adults.  This type of issue isnot that surprising in a debut novel; I fully expect that Scalzi's \\"voice\\" will become more refined in further works, and I look forward to finding that out shortly as I dive into the next few novels.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was a most entertaining book.  It kept me interested page after page.  It gave me a better understanding of the evils of slavery.  I was left with a greater respect<br />for those people who had to live as owned by others.
B0035LJZ1Q|5.0|This is a awesome remake...Johnny takes on the role like the pro he is...Make your own judgement.. It is a great movie for anyones collection..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Crny title aside....this game is in my opinion better than Temple Run. This game has three &quot;lanes&quot; you can run on instead of one wide one. more obstacles, more collectibles. challenges unlockables and so much more. Temple Run can be very dull the first few seconds. this game gives youbso many missions. it is always exciting.
B005K17RU0|4.0|works like it says that it should. its just a weather so its nothing exciting.  it tells me when its raining or not which is good.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Clearly I was using it incorrectly the first time I installed it.  Re-installed this app and have been using it every day since.  Love the hour-by-hour temperature feature; really helps me plan my day.
0312641893|3.0|I thought the plot was interesting and for those who like Sci Fi they will probably enjoy this clever book.  I'm more into the traditional fairy tales and historical fiction myself.
B000002KK2|3.0|I was just beginning my music obsession in the days when Rickie Lee Jones released this album.  I remember it being popular yet finding the songs, including the very-popular \\"Chuck E.'s in Love\\", mediocre.  Over 30 years later, after hearing some of her music played in an audiophile listening session, I ordered this famous album.  Hearing it again after 30 years, I was left with the same impression: mediocre.  My wife thought it was nice, but to me it was and still is profoundly uninspiring.  I listened to a few tracks again just now and can't give it more than three stars.  That said, the audio quality is good for the year.
0316228532|3.0|I would recommend this book. If you are not familiar the UK language it will be enlightening.  The plot is slow and predictable.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I had to read this fit school and so it took me awhile to get into it. Overall I enjoyed it!

0062127241|2.0|In the glory days of classic rock, Pete Townshend was the rock star of choice for many an introverted, analytical fan.  Where the Stones's cool and the Beatles' regality rendered them both somewhat unrelatable to the average fan; many of us could relate to the onstage spasticity and offstage uncertainty of the Who's guitarist/songwriter.  Like us, he was looking for answers and could act unbecomingly when he couldn't find them.  It's not a great stretch to trace the beginnings of both 'seventies punk and heavy metal to Townshend's persona.  Then he kind of disappeared, surfacing only occasionally with some esoteric \\"multimedia\\" initiative or another repackaging of one of his earlier works.  Where was he?<br /><br />Apparently he was working on this book in the house which he bought, in part, for the purpose of having a place to write this book.  It was Ron Wood's house and is named The Wick.  We hear a good deal about the houses he has bought and their names, along with the names of his boats and all the famous/rich people with whom he has hung out.  Despite a good deal of self-deprecation, the overall impression that this book leaves is being present at the end of a Townshend therapy session where he exclaims:  \\"I am handsome, talented and rich and people really do like me!\\"  Instead of insight into the appeal of Meher Baba's teachings, we get another couple of pages built around his short-termed obsession with one woman or another.  Instead of hearing more about the evolution of his creative process, we learn that he's a latter day devotee to the Artist's Way handbook.  Instead of hearing about which subsequent/contemporary musicians he feels an artistic kinship, we get dollar amounts for how much he's contributed to various causes.<br /><br />Expectations were high for an autobiographical work from one of the most articulate spokespersons of the Rocker's Way.  Unfortunately, they've been drowned in a sea of Pete's self-recrimination/self-justification.  In this book, Townshend is what he always feared that he'd become:  A boring old fart.
030759565X|5.0|Everything about the cookbook is wonderful.<br /><br />The recipes are fabulous. The pictures are gorgeous. The blurbs that come with each recipe are so much fun to read. And Deb is so real you'll feel like she's your best friend.
B00008BRB5|4.0|The best Police album! this album came out in 1983 and it was the best at that time.The album is great from start to finish.It has awesome hits like \\"Every breath you take\\",\\"king of pain\\" and \\"wrapped around your finger\\".Songs that are always present on compilations or greatest hits.If you are someone who only likes \\"greatest hits\\",I recommend you \\"The Police the anthology\\"(2cds).On the other hand if you are a big fan of Police and like concept albums.Do you a favor and buy it.The sound is quite good.This edition was released in 2003.the package is better the the plastic case.However,it's not so great.I think that The Police must do a better remaster and release a deluxe edition of the complete catalog.I received this item in perfect condition and on time.
B007C94XG4|4.0|my daughter loves this movie.  it is not the most enjoyable kid movie I have ever seen, but she has watched it like 10 times.  i think that sometimes those adult-friendly kid movies are not as enjoyable for kids and this one is really all about entertaining kids and it succeeds at that.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|I am always listening to music. From metal, to electronic, to rap. Though, my music tends to be very selective. I like finding new bands that have a unique sound to them, and this happens to be one of my newest additions. I was referred to the song \\"Blood\\" by my fiancee and I have to say, I wasn't really impressed. I heard it about a week later on the radio and ever since then I've been hooked on it. It isn't the best album in the world, but it's definitely worth a listen.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie via Amazon On Demand. I'd describe it as a semi-fantastic chase adventure with some romance and very likeable characters (though some are less likeable, none are horrible). Overall, it left us with a warm feeling. If you enjoy other Wes Anderson films, you'll enjoy this one too. If you haven't seen any, be aware that there is a stylization of dialogue and events that makes both seem matter-of-fact and unbelievable at the same time. And even though the main characters are kids, it's not a kids' movie. There are a lot of adult themes.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|John Corey is as charming as we know him and he doesn't disappoint his fans in his new overseas assignement. Looking forward to the next one!!!
B000J1AGQI|5.0|this is by far one of the best movies i've seen, not just dealing with the Viet Nam war, but with war in general. the acting is superb, and the storyline is beautifully written. i have seen it more times than i can count and it makes me cry every time. kudos to mel gibson and his terrific cast of fellow actors. they can and should be proud of the work they did on this film.
B00866H7SS|4.0|So much better than 50 shades, and a lot more darker! Would recommend it to anyone having 50 shades withdrawal symptoms!
B002QFYJF4|1.0|I don't know for sure - I haven't seen them all.  Worst movie I've ever seen?  Without a doubt.  This movie was so bad and so annoying I don't even want to talk about it.  Just wanted to give a warning to the unsuspecting.

B009LK6JS2|4.0|When is the update coming ,because I am kind of getting bord of the same old planes. Also the missions are too easy, the creators need to make them harder, also they should make new missions for a larger variety of planes. But the paid app is great overall!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I simply can not get enough of this game. If you like time management/strategy games, don't think twice about downloading this right now.
B007WT135S|4.0|I was very surprised at just how good this book was with the early days of the rock and roller particularly interesting. The first three quarters of the book are really engaging and hard to put down but then it just runs out of steam. You can almost hear Keith thinking \\"I have lost interest and now have to fill the contract quota of pages\\" and his passion seems to run dry. But it is well worth the price despite the sagging towards the end. It also made you realise that while Keith seems to have the image of being THE Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger has kept things together while Keith was off his face and been unreliable. I read this book thinking it would be a chore but it was generally quite the opposite.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Absurd and hollow story line. Mediocre acting. All the hype about this being a Ridley Scott movie was not worth it.
B003TH41H4|5.0|This is one of the best show I've ever seen. from the moment I first watched it I fell in love with it. there are many moments that I cried, and many that gave me the chills with happiness. but the end was the best and worst of all. I cried because it was sad of what had to be done to save the world and also sad because the show was coming to an end. I have grown so close to my new \\"friends\\", and the quests that they were working toward. it is a shame that we will not see them again in the future. If you wish to see a third season, visit saveourseeker.com
B0053O89JM|5.0|So far Season 8 has been an improvement over Seasons 6-7 that went \\"soap opera\\" with too much fantasy, in my opinion.  I was a fan of Season 1-5, and this season seems to be coming back to reality, and more about solving educational medical puzzles.<br /><br />Losing Cuddy and \\"13\\" seemed to remove distractions that made the show a disappointment in Seasons 6-7, and it is good to have new fellows as doctors with a fresh point of view on diagnostics and dealing with Dr. House who now has some restrictions on his ability to go crazy, and I think will make this season more believable.<br /><br />House seems to be back to his pill-poping self, but clearer thinking and slightly more aware of the rest of humanity.  I think Dr. Foreman moving to Dean of Medicine was a good move and places that role more in perspective.<br /><br />Having viewed the entire season 8, I enjoyed all except for the ending where Dr. House seems to \\"throw in the towel\\" when he usually would have found a way out, avoiding as much pain as possible, and still continue his struggle for truth and something greater than himself and his own interests.  Like all good shows, they never seem to have good endings.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm a member of big fish and I love their games so I was excited to try this game. I just finished it and I cant wait for the next one. gameplay and graphics were amazing and I would recommend enigmatis to anyone. this is my first review and I only did it because I enjoyed the game so much. Ps I'm 29 not one of those kids always reviewing everything.
B001KQEE0U|5.0|Great album by an artist who will never be forgotten. \\"All Eyez on Me\\" has to be the best album of the 90's west coast rap scene. U will be glad to read my review before you buy and wont regrdtt it.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|Found it not up to par for Johnny Depp.  Kept waiting for it to take off and get exciting/interesting.  The play spots on advertisements made it look a lot better than what it actually is.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Billy Bean has done for baseball what Nathan Myrvhold has done for cooking in \\"Modernist Cuisine\\", and Michael Lewis was there to record it.<br /><br />If you like intellectual science in sports you'll love this book: it tells the story of those who were able to look at something traditional from a new angle.
B008OOYALE|5.0|was awesome game should take. make great fun for kids and wife it was awesome good game thing. yes it is great
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I have a similar app on my phone... and was just looking to see if there was one available for my kindle, considering I am on the east coast, and was preparing to be without power.  I NEED noise to sleep!!  I found the selction of different noises to be great.  I however have not needed to use it... thankfully we didn't lose power.  I do plan on using it on an upcoming vacation though :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and is challenging. It makes my mind work in ways that I don't usually work it. People really should at least try this game.
0446580848|2.0|I dont write too many reviews but I really felt compelled to save some time for people contemplating reading this book. If you're expecting an action-packed John Corey-returns-to-save-the-day thriller, you'll get about four pages of that, starting on page 609. If you're looking for a long, drawn out, stumbling plot with a large measure of Yemeni history, than this is your book. In short, save yourself a lot of time and look elsewhere. DeMille hasnt written a decent book since Plum Island.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game ever.  but l do not like that it has no cakes author then that it is the best game ever
B004V5A7K8|5.0|I picked up this app as the free app of the day because I enjoyed the classic arcade game.  This game works great on my Kindle Fire and is easy to play.  Moving the paddle on the bottom of the screen is smooth...not jerky as I have encountered with other games.  The graphics are great, the colors bright and there are many chances to pick up features (such as a larger paddle or multiball) or extra points.  Even at 99 cents it is well worth the price if you enjoy this type of game.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I haven't read any Stephen king in over 20 yrs. But it was worth it. Always liked his style. I would recommend: his one.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|E.L. James definitely has written something that will keep the reader on the edge of their seat and constantly gives examples of how thinking outside the box is not a bad thing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is pay more adansion to play games.someone is easy and others is very hard to pass.iphone can not play games.it is so small
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm happy to see this was a major bestseller for YA fiction. I wasn't really crazy about the Twilight books and I think this novel has a lot more literary skill and a better story. I'm joyful to see some much-needed talent return to popular fiction. As for the story, it's great! The novel is very fast-paced, the characters develop through action rather than internal dialogue which keeps you turning the page. Suzanne Collins shows, she doesn't tell. On top of being a televised fight to the death in a strange, yet eerily familiar/plausible world (the allusions to Coliseum society of Ancient Rome are many), this is also an engaging love story with memorable characters. The dialogue is colored with characterization. Overall this is an engaging, action-packed, thought-provoking read. While the thought-provoking part is lacks compared to the amount of action in it, Hunger Games is an enjoyable, worthwhile read which is saying something. For a long time I resisted the urge to jump on the bandwagon and didn't read this book, but when I did I enjoyed every moment of it. It's a quick, easy read but stays with you after you turn off your Kindle.<br /><br />5 Stars.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Books I and II were fantastic.  I am just getting started reading Book III and have not been disappointed yet.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I found I could put the book down without wishing I had more time to read. In the Harry Potter series, especially in the first few books, I was totally entranced and intrigued by Ms Rowling's imagination, her quirkiness and her ability to draw the reader into the story.  This did not happen to me in the Casual Vacancy. Found it somewhat pedestrian.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is the funniest show if you appreciate slightly nerdy humor. Sheldon is probably the best new character on tv.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Poor graphics. Only played once and deleted it. Hard to manage on a small screen. Stick with the real deal.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|Was pretty disappointed with the \\"A Thousand Suns\\" album. Downloaded \\"Living Things\\" first day it was released and can't stop listening to it. Every song has great melodies and lyrics. \\"Lost In The Echo\\", \\"Burn it Down, and \\"In My Remains\\" are amazing, reminds me of the old LP. If you liked Hybrid Theory, Meteora, and Minutes to Midnight, you will probably like most of these songs.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Breaking Bad is literally an addictive series. Excellent and compelling.A must watch from beginning to end. Hard to turn away.
B007PVHANM|2.0|Bland, Unfocused Effort is a good way someone put it. It's an alright movie. I like Bob's music but if anything this movie shows that this life style is not healthy. The biographical points were interesting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I highly recommend this app it has various games and the variety from traditional to fun games makes this app worth uploading
B003B5M0PO|5.0|I download this when the film came out and I still won't watch it. I read this in a few hours and that's not a criticism at all, it kept me hooked. This was from the horses perspective which took some getting used to. This book has drawn me to other Michael Morpurgo books. Yes its mainly for children but I enjoy reading and his style is very easy going farm boy is next. Enjoy I know I did.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great storytelling again by Ken Follett. You'll be drawn into the characters lives and won't be able to put it down.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|I can't recall what drew me to this book, I think its because it reminded me of a film I'd seen some years ago about someone who lost their memory. But it didn't have the twists or the ending this had. This would appeal to anyone who likes to read books that keep them intrigued and sit back and think. I didn't see it ending like that.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I've always had great respect for our military and navy seals, others. But after reading this book I have a whole new level of respect ... and thanks!
B009A3NGF4|2.0|The sigh no more album was epic, every song was awesome. It had a great new grass sound, everything was right in the world. Then two hit wonder Babel comes out and breaks my heart. If you're considering this album save the $10 and just buy the sobs you hear on the radio, they're the only ones worth a shit.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It will leave you feeling icky. The characters are phony and the plot is ultimately silly. I kept thinking it was just glib, but now I think its also inane.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a really fun game I have do miluch fun playing it and it is a really good game to pass the time!!!!! :)
B000002AHM|5.0|After the Giants won the World Series, I've been in the mood for things related to San Francisco.  All the while listening to Friday Night in San Francisco with all the Spanish guitars, I was wondering \\"What does Carlos Santana think about this work?\\" because you just *know* he heard it, and I'd bet anything he's an enormous fan.<br /><br />\\"Mediterranean Sundance/Rio Ancho\\" is a major improvement over Al Di Meola's Elegant Gypsy version because the studio cut only shows us a small example of the monstrous storm these instrumental skills are capable of.  Perhaps the only challenging song on the album, you want to remember more and more of the acoustic guitar melodies the more you play it.  Since Paco de Lucia, John McLaughlin, and Al Di Meola are pretty much the definition of replay value, you're all set with this piece.  For 11 minutes the ride is intense the whole way through.  You just have to prepare yourself for nonstop acoustic passages.<br /><br />I probably prefer the Land of the Midnight Sun version of \\"Short Tales of the Black Forest\\" ONLY because it reminds me of some classical composer who's gone mad, however this version is quite the delight as well.  I like how around the 4 minute/40 second point the guitars change into a riff that resembles George Harrison's \\"I Dig Love\\" which is just a coincidence, before shifting into a clever concept similar to \\"The Dance of Maya\\" from Mahavishnu Orchestra's The Inner Mounting Flame with the blues, but of course, based around acoustic Spanish guitar work.  I like how the audience participates with hand claps that follow along to the blues melody, but my favorite part is near the end when the tempo shifts into one that makes me visualize a sunrise over a field of violets.<br /><br />\\"Fantasia Suite\\" is arguably superior to Al Di Meola's Casino version, and... I guess it's obvious by this point the album focuses on Meola's output.  Maybe a few McLaughlin songs from his Devotion album would have been a fantastic decision... but who am I kidding?  I'm dreaming!  Anyway this version has so much dazzling Spanish guitar playing over a REALLY awesome and familiar melody (familiar thanks to me having played Casino several times) that you can't help but almost cry.  A perfect song, and the final track called \\"Guardian Angel\\" is a fine hunk of melody for anyone who's sorely desiring a more melodic song.  There it is, containing just as much beauty as \\"Fantasia Suite\\".<br /><br />I guess \\"Frevo Rasgado\\" is the weakest selection since much of the guitar playing (particularly during the first half) refuses to stick no matter how many times I play it.  Lucia and McLaughlin were definitely locked in a groove, but the notes just aren't memorable enough this time around.  Acoustic playing for the sake of playing, if you get what I mean.  Oh well, an easy 5-star rating at any rate.  Pick it up now.

B00006J9OT|4.0|\\"Live in Paris,\\" was recorded - live in Paris--at the famous, historic Olympia Music Hall, during the 2001 world tour of multi-award winning Canadian-born thrush Diana Krall.  It was her first release to have been recorded live, and was so successful -it's considered one of her most swinging releases--that she has recorded several more live albums since.  She is a jazz musician who achieved crossover success with her sultry, unforced contralto voice and her piano playing.  Most recently, she has released the best-selling [[ASIN:B008FSCNTK Glad Rag Doll]].<br /><br />LIVE IN PARIS was produced by Tommy LiPuma, whose attention the singer  caught with her first, Canadian release, [[ASIN:B0000071FS Stepping Out]], and with whom she has since worked for quite some time.  The disk consists mainly of popular American standards.  It includes covers of Billy Joel's \\"Just the Way You Are\\" (a hit on U.S. smooth jazz radio); and her fellow Canadian Joni Mitchell's \\"A Case Of You.\\"  Also, Peggy Lee's \\"I Love Being Here with You.\\"  Harold Arlen's \\"Let's Fall in Love.\\"  Burt Bachrach's \\"Look of Love.\\"  Cole Porter's \\"I've Got You under My Skin.\\"  The Gershwin Brothers' \\"S' Wonderful.\\"  And jazz favorites \\"'Deed I Do,\\" \\"East of the Sun,\\" and \\"Fly Me to the Moon.\\"  The performance is also available on DVD.<br /><br />On this album, the songstress is largely backed by John Clayton on bass, with her regular accompanist Christian McBride, bass, on the twelfth track.  Jeff Hamilton is on drums, with her regular accompanist Lewis Nash on drums, on the twelfth track.  Anthony Wilson is on guitar.  The Orchestre Symphonique Europeen, conducted by Alan Broadbent, provides backing on \\"Let's Fall in Love,\\" and \\"I've Got You under My Skin.\\"<br /><br />Krall was born in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada, to a musical family.  The song stylist was playing piano at  four; playing jazz in a local restaurant at 15. She went to the greatly-respected Berklee College of Music in Boston on  scholarship.  She has sold more than six million albums in the US and over 15 million worldwide.  In 2009, Billboard magazine named her the second Jazz artist of the 2000-09 decade, establishing her as one of the best-selling artists of her time. She is the only jazz singer to have eight albums debuting at the top of the Billboard Jazz Albums.  To date, she has won two Grammy Awards and eight Juno Awards. She has also earned nine gold, three platinum, and seven multi-platinum albums.  Krall and British musician Elvis Costello were married in 2003 at Elton John's estate outside London. Their twin sons, Dexter Henry Lorcan and Frank Harlan James, were born in 2006 in New York City.<br /><br />The artist recalls that on her first conversation with composer/arranger Johnny Mandel, she told him that she was both a singer and a pianist. Mandel replied,\\" Oh, so you're a hyphenate! Are you a singer-pianist or a pianist-singer?\\" Krall  then confirmed that her favorite singers have all played piano too: she lists Dinah Washington, Roberta Flack, Shirley Horn, Fats Waller, Andy Bay, and \\"especially\\" Carmen McRae: \\"ultimately\\" Nat King Cole.  She considered the late songstress Rosemary Clooney to be an important mentor for her.  Krall knows how to swing a song, ability certainly in full view on this album; gives it its emotional due, and demonstrates a true feeling for jazz. She can be bluesy when called for, or painterly on a ballad, and, very importantly, she tends to know what the lyrics are about.  Krall's frequent sound engineer Al Schmitt recently told the Los Angeles Times, \\"More than most singers, she knows what's right for her, and she knows how to make it happen musically.\\" Deed she does..

B004DTLK62|2.0|This film is wonderful IF you want to see an amazing actor re-create a basically fictionalized Chaplin...but for those who want the real truth, ignore the \\"REEL truth\\" of this film and read \\"My Autobiography\\" by Charles Chaplin himself. Once that is done, watch this film and see how Attenborough re-created a \\"biography\\" from mixing together elements of fact to create CELLULOID FICTION. Watch \\"The Buster Keaton Story\\" and you'll see the same thing: actual elements from a life well-documented that have nothing to do with reality or blended facts to create something they believed was more interesting and watchable. My thinking is, why would you invest money in falsification? What will they do to Paul McCartney after he is deceased and unable to defend himself from these blended fabrications? I had great respect for Mr. Attenborough before this film was made - I lost it after viewing this film. But as a Chaplin purist, these things bother me - as a film lover, the movie itself is very entertaining - I only wish Mr. A had stuck to the facts as there is NO reason to re-invent the Master. In addition, I should say that the score (by the late John Barry) is absolutely perfect for the scenes and reflects Chaplin's mixture of comedy and pathos, which is, of course, why Chaplin's comedies are high above all others as they truly reflect the human condition and not just for laughs.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|This Motion Picture suffers from often used devices and frequently parodied scenes from as it were other Motion Pictures.This does not deter This particular film from the ugliness of perversion with Nature being parodied by the Un-Natural.Photographs like Computer Generated Special Effects are a device used by so many motion pictures that events seem so like a stamp rather than an event with only so it seems the cost to deter this stamp from approval.This film is lacking more so of character than devices with neither human representation,male or female being particularly intelligent.It is truly unfortunate that opportunity as we have here is unworthy of such an accomplishment as to not be honest or even as it were intelligent.The Weyland Corporation with its Founder(?)appearing in a hologram for a purpose that should in fact represent the passing of time and perhaps even the eclipse of life for its founder.It is in fact not that,it is in fact a misleading opportunity that its founder is found to be a liar,a contemptable bastard with an entire position being created into a emergency medical module that is designed to extend his life till such time that a quest for perhaps more life is arrived at.It,most certainly is not a sufficent answer however the getting of ones way while all the while being at the expense of the crew is.This is a notable act of treachery that his money and his corporate influence seems to provide even this picture with that is, it is the result of the abuse of Power and its accompanying influence that underwrite this pictures place at all.The speech which accompanies the hologram introduces certain members of the crew which apparently other members either do not know or are not aware of at all,however perhaps we should know when there is a &quot;souless&quot; entity on the ship named &quot;Dave&quot; who is in fact a robot.The Robot concept is almost foolish as &quot;Dave&quot; is not truly a robot but more so &quot;Dave&quot; represents a parody of life and as it were even Nature.The concept of a souless robot seems not to explain that one Dr.Shaw is deceptively violated and a very threatening and dangerous parasitic evolution unfolds.This as it were souless robot is in fact a dangerous adversary who would like nothing better than to return to Earth with a ship sized Parasite just waiting to dis-embark.The film offers that &quot;Dave&quot; most certainly is not without his political moments, when passing time he on a bicycle tranverses a  Basketball Court and from some 25 ft launches a right handed hook shot that goes in(LaDiDa,LaDiDa).&quot;Dave&quot;as well is caught up in as it were wanting to be like with neither Nature or even a Human Being something &quot;Dave&quot; wanted to be like.&quot;Dave&quot; so it seems wants to look like and perhaps even be like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia.This reference to &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and even as compelling the basketball court scene suggest that &quot;Dave&quot; is like our Humanoid character possessing Racial as well as Aryan conceit. He practices the languages that may of in fact be the language of &quot;The Humanoid&quot; and later on is rudely dealt with though perhaps his undoing had more to do with not knowing the &quot;Humanoid&quot; rather than not speaking its language.The disaster that unfolds does place opportunity as a reckless even provocative position whereby none will survive.The utter careless and as well uncaring path that the entire crew followed was anything but careful or perhaps even more to the point even scientific.There was a hands on approach to such danger that only death can be thanked for getting rid of these idiots.Death here is more than merely the unknown,it is in fact what may be driving this mission to begin with, with the results being something predictable and not entirely unexpected.&quot;Dave&quot; possesses a loyal and pre-determined position whereby his creator may in fact be &quot;The Weyland Corporation&quot;, &quot;Dave&quot; so it seems is following orders. &quot;Dave&quot; is very dangerous and this concept is most certainly not lost on Dr.Shaw.The name of the ship is &quot;Prometheus&quot; with the year 2089 being the year that this picture for the most part takes place.The Crew was placed in a state of suspended animation with the time of 2 years 4 months and 20 days having been eclipsed as the &quot;Prometheus&quot; traveled from one galaxy to another in a location suggested to be the galaxy &quot;Alpha Centuri&quot;.Something of a look a like to this particular Milky Way world that presently the Earth is located.The &quot;Humanoid&quot; like individual is difficult to know as his or its purpose is as well not entirely understood.The Reference earlier to Photographs is suggestive as an illustration of what this race of humanoid beings might be capable of-It appears that the &quot;Humanoid&quot; may only if anything be many copies of himself.This is indeed perhaps even a startling discovery that this discovery is not as yet knowable however The &quot;Humanoid&quot; is more than merely a threat.This is a dangerous development with a undetermined cause providing Its place at all.The picture leaves no doubt that the &quot;Humanoid&quot; is or perhaps was planning to attack the Earth and had the technology to do it or so it would seem.It is truly not entirely clear as to who or what this &quot;Humanoid&quot; creature actually in fact represents.Some of the film suggests gentically engineered DNA completing something of a quest as to Mans place in the Universe.There is not enough information though some might say more is needed to know.Appearing in a 2 Disc-Documentary, titled &quot;The Nazis:A Warning From History&quot;There is a photograph of Nazi German Dictator Adolf Hitler looking intently at a bust of this films &quot;Humanoid&quot;.This reference provides an integral link as to who this being in fact represents.He in fact represents an Aryan concept and further his place is as a superior human being.There is a fight nearing the films completion between The &quot;Humanoid&quot; and The &quot;Parasitic Octopus&quot; with the &quot;Parasitic Octopus&quot; indicating just how dangerous this creature was to begin with.The result appears to be a creature that defies pre-history.This was the result of the violation of Dr.Shaw whereby the &quot;Parasite&quot;  came from a large depository,almost like a weapons hold and seem again to represent a underwriting of Bio-Terroism. This film is an attempt upon mans place and perhaps as well it prescribes another world entirely.This as it were alternative is not really an alternative but the end of this world and our place here as well.The threat that this film represents is truly felt with the discovery of both the &quot;Humanoid&quot; and the &quot;Parasitic&quot; developments.The Parasite should not be ignored however the &quot;Humanoid&quot; ship possesses a weapon which as much as it serves notice it is symbolic as well as in fact a very formidable looking development.This is in fact something that looks familiar as there is a War that is about to be Launched.It is a unmistakable Alarm that needs to be put in place to properly ascertain how to gauge this  threat.This is a real threat and a real threat is what this picture wishes to be. This is the agenda this world has underwritten with the Motion Picture and it is this motion picture that is conveying this threat.
B009VB97EY|1.0|God, this was awful!!! The trailer made it look lighthearted and funny, but it's FAR from that!

0316228532|1.0|I bought this book based on the popularity of the author from the Harry Potter series of which I read the first three and half of four and stopped as they got too dark and I did not enjoy them anymore.  The Casual Vacancy did not have one smile in the whole book.  Not one character to like or champion.  I read about 40 books a year and have for many years.  I took this book to the trash masher dumpster to make sure no one could take it out to read.  I have never done that with a book before.  The book is all about bullying.  The parents bully the kids, the kids bully the parents and their teachers and their peers, the parents bully their friends.  And there is no saving grace in the whole book.  What was the point in writing it?  It gave no hope that this practice could be contained or ways to change it. It seems like the author is promoting bullying.  I have never been so disappointed in a book and I read across all genres.  I am 84 years old and have been an avid reader my entire life since I learned to read in grade school.

B003O5MO2A|5.0|Being that there are already 60+ reviews of this absolutely legendary album I'm going to use this as a chance to vent. WHY IN HELL HAS THIS ALBUM NOT BEEN REMASTERED??? It is an absolute travesty that Columbia Records released a beautiful Legacy Edition of '78 single-LP live album \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\"(which while certainly being a great live album and BOC classic is NOWHERE near as amazing as \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\")which included a top-notch remaster of the original live album AND a Bonus Live DVD, but as of yet haven't even released a simple remastered version of \\"On Your Feet...\\". Now I am well aware that \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\"(following hot on the heels of BOC's two biggest selling studio albums \\"Agents Of Fortune\\" from '76 and \\"Spectres\\" from '77 both of which featured major radio hits in \\"Don't Fear The Reaper\\" and \\"Godzilla\\")went Platinum(sold a million copies) and so therefore, if you're strictly determining which BOC albums deserve a fancy reissue by sales \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\" would be at the top of the list. But here's where things REALLY drive me nuts. Columbia did a superb job remastering the first three BOC albums(\\"Blue Oyster Cult\\", \\"Tyranny & Mutation\\", and \\"Secret Treaties\\") and even added bonus tracks and decent liner notes. So WHY did they not do the same for \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\", a truly legendary double-live album which celebrates those first three albums??? It's like they just decided to skip it. Well thanks alot guys, you skipped one of the most energetic, hard rocking, brilliant live albums in rock history...The only live rock albums from the 70's which are in the same league as \\"On Your Feet...\\" for sheer live brilliance are THIN LIZZY's \\"Live And Dangerous\\", UFO-\\"Strangers In The Night\\", PAT TRAVERS BAND-\\"Go For What You Know!\\", MC5-\\"Kick Out The Jams\\", DEEP PURPLE-\\"Made In Japan\\", JUDAS PRIEST-\\"Unleashed In The East\\", AC/DC-\\"If You Want Blood You've Got It\\", FOGHAT-\\"Live!\\", HAWKWIND-\\"Space Ritual\\" and arguably KISS-\\"Alive\\" and BLACK OAK ARKANSAS-\\"Raunch And Roll\\". ALL of these great albums(with the tragic exception of PAT TRAVERS BAND-\\"Go For What You Know!\\") have been remastered(many reissued with bonus material) and treated with the respect they deserve!<br /><br />BLUE OYSTER CULT-\\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" from '75 is just mind-blowingly rad and perfectly captures BOC at the peak of their hard rockin powers. It is a celebration of the first era of BOC and marks the beginning of the second period of BOC's history(don't even get me started on how enraged it makes me that BOC's hugely under-rated '79 masterpiece \\"Mirrors\\" LP and '80's Martin Birch-produced gem \\"Cultosaurus Erectus\\" LP have also NOT YET been remastered and reissued, and I fear probably never will). It is easily one of the greatest live albums of the 70's and most important is RIPE for remastering!!! Those of us who grew to love \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" via the original two-record set KNOW how good \\"On Your Feet...\\" sounds and how in need of a modern remaster the CD version is. So if you are a casual BOC fan and haven't heard \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" you should totally check it out(if possible on vinyl until a remastered version is available, although if you don't have a turntable the CD will do...for now)! If you've never heard any of BOC's pre-\\"Agents Of Fortune\\" LP material and are a fan of intelligent, high-energy, drugged-out, hard-rock/post-psych, guitar rock then you have to check out \\"On Your Feet...\\". It's a great starting point and introduction to BLUE OYSTER CULT.<br /><br />So I'll keep complaining until my re-occuring dream comes true. That dream is as follows: I cruise down to my local records store and like always make my way to the BOC section in the hopes of finally finding a remastered version of \\"On Your Feet...\\"(as well as \\"Mirrors\\" and \\"Cultosaurus Erectus\\"). Only this time, there it is. A two-disc Legacy Edition of \\"On Your Feet...\\" fully remastered and maybe even containing some killer bonus tracks taken from the shows which make up \\"On Your Feet...\\". After buying it at the speed of light, I race home, take a few tokes, pop in the first disc, crank it up to 11, and sit back satisfied...Not just that there is FINALLY a remastered CD version, but also that SOMEONE IN POWER finally recognized that \\"On Your Feet...\\" is a bona fide CLASSIC and deserved the royal remastered reissue treatment.ntaining some killer bonus tracks taken from the shows which make up \\"On Your Feet...\\".

But then it seemed like the author just got tired of writing. It is amazing how a bad ending can change my whole perception of the entire book. I glad I got this book from the library. I would have been very disappointed if I paid for this with my hard earned money.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This could have been a REALLY good movie, but it fell short of my expectations. I love sci-fi thrillers and I remember loving Alien. But this ended up being predictable and expected.

It's won't be an entire waste of time, but I would say wait till it's \\"free\\" for Prime members...or from a $1 box somewhere...i just expected more from Scott after all this time.

0307454894|4.0|The modern German novelist Bernhard Schlink writes novels that make his readers feel and think to the very depths of their soul and mind. While storyline can be, at times, morally uncomfortable, the lessons he wants us to learn are nothing short of blessed and heroic. The time and setting is post-war Germany, when a nation is still dealing with the terrible guilt of the Holocaust. What we see on the surface is a sordid story of an older German woman named Hannah sexually exploiting a callow youth named Michael. If we can get past that initial shock of having to confront moral turpitude in its vilest form, we will be rewarded with an amazing accounting of why people do what they do to get by, even if it is wrong. At the heart of their illicit relationship comes a codependency that his desperate need to be loved and her need to overcome the stigma of being illiterate. While Hannah never shares her secret, Michael becomes her reader and gatekeeper to a world of emotions and ideas previously unknown t her. She eventually realizes that she cannot go on indulging in this relationship so suddenly disappears from his life. As Michael moves into manhood and law school, he suddenly meets up with Hannah again: this time as a spectator at her war crime trial as a Nazi prison guard at one of the camps. She will confess to everything the courts accuse her of only because she does not want to be cross-examined on a report that she cannot read. While she is able to gain the sympathy of the tribunal assigned to decide her fate in terms of not really knowing the full consequences of her actions, she still has to live with a guilty conscience of using a personal failing such as illiteracy to indulge wretched behaviour throughout her life. When she truly confronts her tragic past, only one choice remains for her.

The plot is fast paced and the characters are interesting. I love Connelly because his books doesn't insult the intelligence of his readers .<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading all his books. The next one will be his most recent, The Drop.
0446580848|4.0|Nelson DeMille's John Corey Series is one of my Top 5 all-time favorites. That said, The Panther was too long and too slow. In Chapter 2, John and Kate are asked to participate in a dangerous mission to Yemen, and don't actually reach the Yemeni airport until Chapter 16. This is typical of the novel's pacing.<br /> Most of the long gaps between action scenes were bridged by John's wit and DeMille's desire to share huge chunks of research on Yemen. If the novel was a meal and the action & tension were the meat and potatoes, the research was the vegetable, and John's quips the dessert, The Panther would consist of two ounces of meat, a tablespoon of mashed potatoes, 14 asparagus spears, and all the chocolate cake you can eat. In DeMille fan parlance, The Panther was to The Lions Game what The Gate House was to The Gold Coast.<br /> There were a couple of plot holes that I found troubling. In one, John asked, \\"What if it's raining?\\" after hearing the plan for a mission to Marib.  He was told, \\"It hasn't rained in Marib in 200 years.\\" Fifty pages later, his team touched down on a road in Marib and ran from the plane to a roadside ditch which was large enough to provide cover for all of them. I checked online and found that Marib gets about two inches of rain per year; not enough to merit a man-sized ditch. But, then again, Yemen is where Noah's Ark was supposed to have landed. Maybe the municipal planners didn't get the memo about \\"The Fire Next Time.\\"<br /> Despite the tone of this review, DeMille's John Corey Series will continue to be one of my favorites. I just wish he'd take a tip from Stephen King's non-fiction, \\"On Writing.\\" Early in his career, one of King's editors told him to always cut 10% from his first draft. In the case of The Panther, a 40% haircut would have turned this into an excellent read.
B0083F5J7S|5.0|One of the things my granddaughters like most about me is that I love the same music they do and I still have an eye for gorgeous talent.  I am a huge Adam Levine fan, with or without Maroon 5.  Overexposed should be renamed over-sexposed. If you get bent out of shape over a little rough and suggestive language, including some four-letter words (spoken, sung, and implied), you won't like the studio version of this music.  The first time I heard Adam yell at the beginning of #11, I knew this was going to be my very favorite CD ever!  I have almost worn it out already!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books and this was one of the best. It was so well researched, I thought that DeMille must have traveled to Yemen in order to write this story. It was a page turner and hard to put down.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|its a nice free calculator ...does the job for me and no issues using it on my kindle fire device.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The seller corrected my disappointment by taking back and returning money I payed for product, I was really unable to enjoy the movie at all because it had many audio problems and bad pixels throughout the video, but from what I did see it was too much like Alien!  Alas people don't be afraid to purchase something from the seller, because they did take care of the problem!<br />Sincerely, bart black
B00785P2QC|5.0|nice game! similar to Sim city except you have tasks to do. best of all its free and works great on the kindle fire!
B005LAIHZE|4.0|My wife brought this home and I went into it expecting NOT to like it at all.  I mean, let's be honest, it sounds silly and I absolutely can't stand Tim Burton films.  After we finished, we were both surprised at how much we enjoyed it!!  In fact, it's one of the better movies I've seen in a while.  Now, I have not read the book and I saw a couple of reviews on here that 1 starred it for not following the book word for word.  Not sure I agree with that, but to each his own.<br /><br />About the movie:<br /><br />The action sequences were amazing; the sets & costumes were excellent; the special effects were top notch; the story was quite good with great acting.  What more do you want in a movie?  The people who are going to like this movie are going to be those who enjoy action/graphic horror movies with great special effects.  If you are a 'Bridges Over Madison County' or 'Sex in the City' kind of person then this probably isn't for you!  In fact, if you are a man and can say you enjoy the 2 movies I just mentioned, you might want to think about having that surgical procedure to have your nads removed....  but I digress....<br /><br />Oh yeah...you want to spend the extra $ and rent it on blu-ray if you have a nicer tv and sound system.  The blu-ray really takes advantage of the cinematography and great sound in the movie.  Enjoy!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|When I read this book I had no idea that it would make me want more. It was beyond what I have expected and wish I could get more. Love love loved this book. If you have not read this book, you need to buy it today. This book is nothing like anything I have read in a long time.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I found this book very interesting in the fact that most people live by a clock each and every day and dream about the day when we no longer have too.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|Well, it seems that the application, though recently installed before a reset of my phone can now no longer be installed because it is suddenly &quot;incompatible!&quot; What in the world?
B00846REIS|5.0|The only downside to the series is having to wait till May for the third book to release! Gideon Cross is the ultimate man.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really good game to play It reminds me of mario and it is very fun to play my son likes getting on it and I have to pry it from him
B000OLV97I|5.0|My daughter loves this movie. She likes the story and the special effects.<br />She watches it over and over again. This is a good movie for tweens.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun app that holds my attention while i play it. i wish that the games were just a little bit more challenging though.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Alright. Prometheus isn't for everywne. You'll love or hate it. Or like or loathe it. The plot is rife with holes, scientific method advisers were clearly not consulted in the studio's rush to get this movie out after god knows how many years since Alien now? And these aliens look way too much like us to be scary.<br /><br />There are astronaut zombies and cobratic phallic hissing dentata-face things, as suggested by other reviewers. But it's more like a horror scifi Tone Poem. A sort of visual symphony. With proper logic notes and implausible hues, it kinda draws you into a world that's vast and alien, yet with archetypes sprinkled throughout which awaken glimpses of prescient wonder, harkening back to our genetic memories. What would confronting your creator be like? How would You fare?<br /><br />Sir Ridley Scott has created a particularly potent world, and populated it with dunderheads. Monty Python in outer space might've done better, even survived the events. Benny Hill would've made it out. I'm talking about some of the writing required to get the crew from point A to point Z in the movie, with all the scares intact.  The actual actors played it perfectly. And even the characters were well rounded, for their roles. I think many sympathize with Shaw, as many as with David. When he says \\"I think I can,\\" at the end, it's chilling.<br /><br />Themes in the movie delve into lineage, mortality and genetics, with emphasis on an alien catalytic fluid, where accelerated dna dissolution and recombination yields voracious organisms that quickly wipe everything out, morphing towards their host's form with every generation. The end of the movie is great in that regard, by the way.<br /><br />Monsters? Exploding heads? Zombie spacemen? Self-induced abortion of a tentacled demon foetus? All there.<br /><br />Presentation is epic. Sets feel totally real. Costumes, setting, lighting, spacecraft, effects? Magnificent. Biblical at points.<br /><br />This is a companion to Alien, more than a prequel. What else happened in that universe, that Ripley happened on to? The events are in different planets... so it's easy to think of them as nearly simultaneous. So while Shaw is off looking for the creators, the colonial marines are getting splattered.<br /><br />It would be soooooo freaking cool if Blade Runner was tied into this world somehow. It would make Ridley Scott's epic legacy even grander than it already is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really loved this trilogy. As with the other books, I couldn't put it down. Way to go, E L James.
1594745692|4.0|This is an entertaining and wonderful deck.  The designs are incredible, with zombies, organs and some creepiness. The pictures still withhold their original meaning ,with and extra spunk and I love my card. Would recommend them to any zombie loving reader.
B00935KWWO|5.0|I recently had Plume on my HTC, so when I seen they released one for the Kindle I expected a great app and that is exactly what this twitter app offers
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I enjoyed a solid follow-on to Iron Man and Captain America.  Not the best sequel but worth a view on a slow night.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This is basically a story about the magic within a circus.  I thought the story was very disjointed and was very anticlimatic.  I ended the book still having questions about what happened to some of the characters.  Was not a book to really grip you.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Not quite what I was expecting but entertaining. Not worth buying but worth watching one time. Just do it asa rental.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|By book three, I have to be honest... I'm tired of all the sex.  Christian makes me so uncomfortable with his controlling, smothering ways that I find it too much.  Maybe because I could never be with someone like that and common sense tells you that this relationship is doomed.  I want to fall in love with the hero in a romantic story but I just don't feel anything for this guy.  He's sort of a creep.  The more I read, I just kept thinking 5-10 years down the road that these two love bugs are going to KILL each other.  Why would Ana want to be with someone who scares her and she often feels shy around?  Is that sane?  They can't get past their issues, it repeats over and over and over.  For that, I had a hard time reading this.  Besides, the storyline is ho hum.  It's boring. The suspense is poorly done and the bad guy is too easy to catch.  The secondary characters aren't very well developed... I could go on and on.  I usually can't put a good book down but I took lots of breaks reading this one.  However, I wanted to know how it ended so I guess that says something.  Or maybe it's because I had read the whole trilogy and felt obligated.  Not sure. I hoped the last book got better than the first two but it plateaued and didn't satisfy me somehow.  Like I said in my review of book 2 - it disappoints me how similar the plot is to Twilight.  Really?  At least that one isn't as forgettable and more characters actually had personalities.
B003UNK27U|5.0|Extrêmement utile, très bien illustré, je consulte ce livre très souvent. De nombreuses variantes de postures permettent de varier les séances.
B0063IH60K|5.0|best solitaire game,its just the 1 game .easy to play and access.love it......quick and easy to stop or play. like the different ways to play.no problems on the kindle fire.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fishdom has always been one of my favorite games.  I was so glad to see it available for my Kindle Fire!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover took everything that I've ever wanted in a story and put it into Slammed. Will Cooper is the knight in shining armor disguised as a Teacher. The story had me crying and wishing that it never ended.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of the book:<br /><br />\\"Does he treat you with respect at all times? That's the first question. The second question is if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire you to want to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you've found a good man.\\"<br /><br />Live by this ladies. Thanks Colleen Hoover.<br /><br />One more that made me giggle:<br /><br />\\"Why did I just stand there and let him do that? Despite my objections I realize, almost pathetically, that I have just experienced the most passionate kiss I've ever received from a guy-  and it was on the freaking forehead!\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so much fun!!! this is so like temple run and it has cool characters like that hoddie boy
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Great book, repetitive at times but the depiction of in country events is in depth. Interesting to learn how restrictive and involved in each kill the upper echelons try to be. It seems strange that politics are allowed to interfere in the play by play of ground forces. I would never imagine that commanders would question men that have been so extensively trained and then try to second guess decisions. And then after all of that when it comes to light how effective this man was the navy tries to capitalize on his success. The sacrifices these men make are unbelievable and this book sheds light on how after all those sacrifices made just to get to the action the government then hinders their ability to perform there actions. I would  definitely recommend this book, and if you like it also read lone survivor.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I have just finishing reading the book, and I found one of the most inspiring and uplifting books I have read. I guess it was just the right book at<br />the right time.<br />Interesting views of how the ego its present in our daily life, sure it will be!<br />I recomend this book to anyone who is woking on herself/himself and wants to evolve deeper on the life journey.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I've been playing this for a while and i find it a pretty decent game.  like all other story games you do need to spend real money to get gold and unlock a lot of features.  but the game is just as enjoyable without spending a dime.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great book with romance and action at every turn. This trilogy will keep you entertained without a doubt. Read it!
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I found one of the songs on amazon as a free download, I loved it so much I bought this album,and I want all of them, there are two others not available on Amazon yet, that I wish I could get. If you want a good sampling of the songs, look the group up on you tube, the videos are pretty neat, and showoff the artists talent, I wish they were more popular in the US, I would love to see them on tour. the music is great, and several of the songs are acoustic,the songs have neat lyrics some are sad, some are fun, and some are kind of goofy, and I love all of them.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|If you enjoyed comic-books as a kid then you'll enjoy this film. Although some parts are a little cheesy it still is an entertaining film. Graphics are good and the storyline is as well. It sticks to the heart of our comic-book superheroes as they join together and collaborate saving the earth from evil. Ironman steals the show as usual with the laughs but that's just the performance Robert Downey Jr. playing the character gives you. As long as you can get this set for under $20 then it's worth the price. Otherwise just pick the type of Dvd quality that you enjoy and go with it. It makes a nice addition to your Dvd collection.
0525953728|5.0|The author places you inside the operation. Very interesting. Other operations are included. The photos help the reader to see the action
B007SGM084|5.0|I freely admit it - I am addicted to my Kindle and this is the book that started it!  I know there are a lot of different opinions on this book.  Personally, I loved it.  I really hadn't been a big romance reader so I was surprised by some of the very descriptive love scenes!  Ultimately, to me, the story of Ana and Christian was sweet.  I loved that 2 people who were so different were able to offer exactly what the other needed.  I loved seeing the changes in both characters and have read the series more than once, that speaks volumes!<br /><br />I love all 3 books and hope for a Christian POV book at some point - would LOVE to read that!
B000001ESP|5.0|I have had many copies of this recording over the years and it continues to be a great listen everytime. I like to listen to this on my harley and cruise. Good Jams. Never gets old.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is definitely in my top 5 favorite books.  I love Travis and I love Abby.  Their story is filled with ups and downs and at times I just wanted to scream with frustration because I wanted to see them together so badly!!  Abby actually frustrated me a lot, but I still loved her.<br /><br />I happened to love the story and I am counting down the days for Walking Disaster.  This is one that I have read several times!!
B000001ES9|5.0|By far the best RUSH album ever in my opinion. Even though Pert isnt in the picture yet this recording is what started it all. I can listen to this everyday and it is always good. Working Man is probably the worst song on the album if that helps you buy this.I have been listening to this first album since i was 17 and am now 47. Still love it.
B008J34466|5.0|What can I say but WOW!!!!??!!  Pink has done it again.  Post birth of baby and journey into motherhood, post breakup and reunite with her husband Corey, Pink shows that she has what it takes to juggle family AND still be the sexy, talented, fiesty, kick ass star that she is.  Have listened to this album hundreds of times and every time I hear something else that makes me smile, shake my ass and raise one up to a true Rock Star. Ya gotta try this album!
B009329Y30|3.0|This has all of the things you want in a Nicholas Sparks movie - hot guy who's misunderstood and a slowly unwinding love story set in a beautiful Southern location, with a  bonus cute dog, too. My only complaint would be that Taylor, the female lead character, seemed a bit too old for Zac Efron. But maybe I was just wishing it was me instead :)
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I really loved this book right until the very end, and the end took away a full star for me.  I have to say that the book remained in my mind quite while after I was finished, so I cannot guarantee that the end was wrong for the book.  I am not willing to go full spoiler, so I would be interested in what you think.  Because I really did love most of the book, and would urge you to read it.<br />Harold and his wife Maureen are the very flawed heroes of the world.  In a very believable pilgrimage of the soul, they actually through their different roads come together.  When Harold decides to walk 600 miles across England to save a dear friend from cancer, I had very little hope for her or for his journey.  I was not overly fond of his wife Maureen who had trapped herself in martyrdom.  And I was fearful of a novel that would confirm my deepest fears of the decline of age just as I face them myself.<br />But Harold and Maureen's journey into the best parts of themselves is replete with everyday growth in little steps and makes the encroachment of age not at all scary.  The writing is full of small gems from the vantage of frightened older people who fear the best is past.  Yet it is the small step and quiet minutes that the true pilgrimage begins.  The grief of the loss of a child, and the deepening small madnesses that occur are beautifully and accurately portrayed.  Even with its flaws, a book important to read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its anmazing on the kindle fire<br />I love it so much that it sucks<br />and u should get it but why should u take my word for it just look at the other 2 billion reviews
1469984202|4.0|I have always been intrigued with missile silos.  They were seeded across the country in odd places, and one might encounter a military fence in any place.  Local rumors designate a silo.  We know from documentaries that young men lived there deep in the earth waiting for word of a terrible war in which they would have launch the missiles to &#34;save America&#34;. Howdy has taken these stories and constructed instead a world where humans exist deep underground, in silo, to store safe from an unknown disaster that has already occurred.<br />This world is deeply imagined.  The characters remain in the grip of a world lost to its origins.  It is a fascinating dystopia.<br />There is a world seed bank.  The DNA of animals is stored against extinction.  As we fear the changing of our world, the storing of our species is a deeply intuitive turn for an excellent series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />You get to do creative mode and survival so you can just make stuff and also start out with no stuff and you have to collect and build!!!!!!
0767802470|4.0|This is one of the best submarine movies ever made. The director's cut comes in 5.1 surround sound for both audio tracks. It also has behind the scenes and commentary for extras. The picture and audio have been restored and are the best I've seen. If you have seen this movie and liked it, this is a great DVD and worth the money.
B00992CF6W|4.0|where's the gold at I cant find it any where do you guys now idont and need help guys please help
B004499LWQ|5.0|Despite being a film with Julia Roberts, I really like this movie. Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen have enough awesome power to cancel out all the bad vibes I get from Julia. This movie has drama, suspense, and comedy out the wazoo. It's about 2 different couples that cross paths in the middle of a rocky point in their relationships. The four lovers switch partners go solo and get back together again. It's super emtotional love hurricane and it blows these four tragic souls to hell and back. This movie is awesome and has something for everyone. I highly recommend it. Even if you're like me and can't stand Julia Roberts, this movie won't fail to impress. Definitely check it out.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|This one has to be the best super hero adaptation since Smallville.  It follows the mythology of the original somewhat.  However I'm fascinated by the obsession this character has.  Much like a certain Dark Knight we are familiar with.  After being stranded on a desert island, he comes back to civilization.  The main character's deceased father left a list of names. His only living son must track down and eliminate them to save his father's company and his legacy.  Little did his father know that the people that worked for him were all in organized crime.  Not only do I like this show, I plan to buy the DVD when it is out.  I can only hope that this one lasts half as long as smallville.
B002NPY7FE|4.0|This is the best version of this film that I've seen. In the older releases the picture quality is kinda rough. It's got a lot of dull looking colors, and the picture is kinda fuzzy. The Blu-ray is way better. The picture has been cleaned up quite a bit, and the colors are brighter than in the older versions. For a mediocre film this is a very good quality release.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app so much! i am so happy i was able to get it on my kindle! i am always going back to check when its time for a new daily challenge!
B0009MDPYM|5.0|John Constantine is something akin to an exorcist. He sees demons and banishes them back to Hell. His time is limited though. He has inoperable lung cancer, and he does his job to try to buy his way into Heaven before his time runs out. His faith is somewhat lacking though. He meets a young woman who's twin sister's suicide is surrounded by mystery. Will John be able to solve the mystery of this woman's \\"suicide\\" and stop a desperate plot to overtake Hell? Even if he does will his own soul be saved?<br /><br />This movie came out of nowhere it seemed. It was a fresh new idea and it has great actors. This a lot to like about Constantine. I don't think I've met someone yet that didn't like this movie. If you haven't seen it then you really need to get this movie. I hope you like it as much as I do.
B00297FEUI|5.0|I became a big fan of Jablonsky after his original Transformers score, which I thought was just amazing and stunningly beautiful. It became my favorite film score done primarily in a minor key.<br /><br />Coming to this score I couldn't imagine that Jablonsky could equal his triumph with the first one, but he came thru here as well. While I don't think it's quite as good as the original I can't fault him for that as it would be almost impossible for anyone to do that. It would be like requiring Beethoven to equal his 5th or 9th symphony a second time around, and even Beethoven didn't do that.<br /><br />So this score definitely stands on its own, which just goes to show you how talented Jablonsky really is and how he has really matured into a major talent like his mentor Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />Reprising just enough of Transformers for continuity he provides plenty of variety and new material here to keep your interest. He mixes computerized rhythms which provide a haunting, almost basso profundo counterpoint to the more traditional orchestral instruments and voices. As one writer here noted, he also uses human voices the way Zimmer used Lisa Gerard in his score for Gladiator, and very effectively at that.<br /><br />Overall, another exceptional score from Jablonsky and I can't wait to hear what he does next.
B0037QGS0A|3.0|Catherine has been suspicious of her husband for quite a while. She pays an escort, named Chloe, to go find whether or not her husband has been cheating on her. The plan goes horribly wrong. David, Chloe, and Catherine find themselves caught up in a vicious love triangle. It's like Fatal Attraction plus one.<br /><br />This movie has an interesting premise and some great actors, but failed to really get me excited about it. I guess it's not really a guy movie. If your a woman and enjoy serious soap opera type drama then this movie will probably make you happy. If your'e looking for something more than that, then you'll probably find it kinda boring. This movie is definitely geared toward females. It's kinda hard to be objective since this film is geared toward an audience that probably doesn't include me, but I think I can see most women really getting a kick out of this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|simple and surprisingly entertaining app. kills plenty of time, free and otherwise. extra fun to play when there are more important things to do.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|This is a really cool movie. Its has an original story great cinematography and some pretty good actors. It's about a city where it always seems to be night. It is under the control of aliens that use human bodies as their vessels. Time sometimes stops so that  the aliens can come out and take people without anyone knowing. The catch is that noone seems to notice. That is except for one man. He notices that the place isn't what it seems to be. His memories are also fabricated. The aliens don't like that someone realizes their scheme. Especially since he has the power to stop them. This is a great gothic sci-fi film. It's definitely one of a kind. You should check it out.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Though I find the TV series infinitely more enjoyable this is a fine book. A very good read for zombie liking people.
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|Eric Draven is murdered along with his fiancee on Devil's Night. One year after the incident he is resurrected and seeks to make right the wrong. He fights to protect the city from the evil drug lord that reigns over it. He's a superhero that's out for revenge.<br /><br />This movie is a classic. There's not another movie that is quite like it. It has a dark and ruthless vibe, as well as a tender and warm side. There is plenty of action, drama, and a bit of comedy in this film. It's got a very powerful and unforgettable story behind it. Especially considering the circumstances surrounding Brandon Lee's sad passing. This is a movie that everyone needs to see. Please don't miss it.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|It is impossible to decipher the &quot;notes &quot; that you're supposed to play.  It is not at all what I expected.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Vincent is a contract killer. Max is cab driver. The two men are drawn together in a very dramatic turn of events. Vincent hires Max to take him to 5 different stops. Max soon learns that he's driving  ruthless hitman to his marks. There's only one way out of it. Max has to take the plunge and decide what is important to him. Even if he stands up for himself, will he be able to take on a professional murderer?<br /><br />This movie is very different. It's got two great actors, and a pretty original plot. The suspense level in this movie off the charts. The thing that sold it for me is the dialogue. The conversations between the two characters are deep and very real. Even though this movie has some good points, it failed to captivate me. There's just something missing that makes a movie a classic. I can't say exactly what it is that this movie lacks, but it certainly needs a little more of it. Nonetheless, Collateral is a pretty good movie, and it's worth watching. I'm not really sure if it's worth having though. You may be better off just renting it.
0786962984|5.0|I didn't get a chance to play the original but I picked this up simply because of its reputation. My wife and I had a great time playing it. She doesn't like dungeon-crawl games or RPGs but she still liked it. After she narrowly beat me, she immediately asked to play again. Great for the price and would be an easy way to introduce someone to fantasy-themed games.
1573301183|5.0|Exactly the DVD I replaced from one that was stolen. Made me very happy to get it back! Thanks so much!
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|The original Conan was brilliant because it was un-self-consciously juvenile.  This one sucked because it was pandering to male juvenile fantasies rather than being an innocent expression of them.
B002QO8E9M|3.0|The set was overpriced from my original order. I didn't like the extraneous stuff & I was disappointed it had a concert feel to it. I owned a different DVD previously & the songs were exactly as recorded. It had one DVD. I'm disappointed & unhappy about the purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Hopefully there will be another book and better yet I'm hoping for a movie
B002QKZLZ6|2.0|Case is ok, but for the most part useless, don't need and don't use.  It's either in your ear or on the charger.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great second book.  Can't wait for the third one. Better than the fifty shades series. Sylvia Day is a great writer.
B0083SBJXS|1.0|Love the movie. I bought combo pack and the DVD was great. Put in the Blu-ray to watch the extras but wouldn't work. Bought another disk. Same problem. So I hooked up my PS3 to the TV thinking it was my Blu-ray even though others work on it just fine. PS3 also didn't work. So how am I meant to see the Blu-ray?

042524489X|3.0|I have waited impatiently for Hawke's book since the series first came out. He was such a troubled soul and I couldn't wait to see him happy...<br /><br />But he shared his story with Walker???<br /><br />I would have loved Walker to have his own book. I felt cheated. The mating took until almost the end of the book which was a real big letdown. I felt there was more story of the war then of Hawke and Sienna. I wanted more time with them, more time watching their budding relationship grow.<br /><br />Instead, everytime they got close, something came up, something pulled them apart. It was extremely frustrating.<br /><br />I am a huge Nalini Singh fan. I loved Luca and Sasha's story, fell in love with the packs, and greedily read each book that was published.<br /><br />But this book was a big disappointment. There were too many other stories going on, clouding what Hawke and Sienna should have had.

B001PILRGC|4.0|While Stargate holds a special place in my heart, I'm grateful that Atlantis ended when it did. After season 2 (or maybe 3) it started down a slow, dry, predictable decay. SG-1 hit its peak around season 7 and did the same thing only it was after seven seasons, so it fell really fast, relatively, and really started to flounder near the end. But who can blame it? 200-odd episodes is a lot. Anyone who can continue coming up with ideas after that point would exceed the human capacity. Atlantis ended before it got that far, which is relief, though an unsatisfactory one. What happens to Pegasus and the Wraith, now?<br /><br />While I'm certainly not glad that Stargate has left the air after SGU (which was actually making a recovery when it was cancelled, in my opinion), I'm glad neither of the later series were dragged through the mud too much. That leaves the possibility for a new series. But it would definitely need to go in a different direction, like Universe tried to do. I'd like for someone to try one more time... but get it right. Until then, I can go back to what's already here and enjoy it again. This franchise is certainly good enough for that.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched the series while on vacation. I really enjoyed the series; can't wait for the third season to start. After watching the series I had to read the book. It's a great read.
6304493681|3.0|Item took a little longer than the norm to arrive. The DVD was in top condition but the cover was damaged and I needed to replace it with a good one.

1449389627|5.0|First of all, its jam packed with lots of interesting bits of history and a different point of view of it. But what is most amazing about this book is that \\"innovation\\", wether its a breakthrough of modern marvel or reinventing a current object, it motivates all of us to challenge the inventor in all of us and create something new. It has given me the push I needed to start those projects I have been dreaming about. In my mind, this book has been the snowball down Mount Everest of my imagination. Thank you Scott Berkun for the inspiration you provided in these 200 pages!!!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you have expectations about characters, hopes for plot points, or ome idea of what will occur in this series......DON'T READ THIS SERIES!<br /><br />Now if you want a seriously grown up read where the choices that each character makes have serious, and not always expeted, consequences then this series may be for you. I do find it amusing when reviewers praise the first couple books of a series and then think the next few stink. This tends to reveal either lazy readers or a lazy author that decides to pull a Terry Goodkind on his readers. I think this series has a lot more of the former and I have yet to see Martin do the latter (fingers still ccrosses).<br /><br />Marim has ripped my heart out several times, made be fall im love with characters that I once hated ...(this is damn hard to do), and left me completely in awe on a number of occasions in this series....and this book continues the trend. Sack up and prepare for a crazy finish.....or cut bait and go read your mom's fantasy books if you can't handle complex writing and characterization.

B001EIK7IC|5.0|I have owned this album since the early 1970's. Although Terry was based in his hometown, he was very popular in Philly then, and one of the Temple University DJ's used You Don't Care\\" as a theme. I loved this album and played it obsessively. Reading his obit last week reminded me of him. While Terry never became a breakout star he apparently had a good life and raised his daughter while working as a computer programmer at the University of Chicago. He was a great musician and this is definitely a great album. It is melodic, creative, and the songs are hypnotizing.

B009YG2ND8|5.0|I am extremely tired of Amazon users that rate apps down for price without even buying the app. I refuse to get the Kindle Fire HD because of the community. Extremely poor attitudes from people that don't know what they are even talking about. I have purchased this game and is the price high? The real question is if you own a smart phone or tablet but can't afford $16 then you have some problems or you don't have a job. Then again two of the reviewers that complained about the price recommended that you use roms. Roms are illegal and is theft, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.<br />The game is worth the money. It is worth 16x these other games. It runs well on the kindle fire and is quite enjoyable if you like old school rpgs.
1400097029|1.0|This book wrung out the last bit of energy and desire I have in me as a reader to read.<br /><br />The book gave me the impression that the writer invested hours in assembly of many of the sentences; in fact, most of the sentences. Who talks this way? Who thinks this way?<br /><br />I just finished it, five minutes ago, and I am exhausted. Exhausted from trying to understand the point of the book, and tired and bored with trying to understand how each word, sentence and thought associates with the ones before and after.<br /><br />It is a hard read and doesn't make you want more. Unfortunately, I purchased this book and Ancient Light together. I just read the first two pages of Ancient Light and guess what? The character is already talking about life as it occurred fifty years ago, along with the fact that he was in love with his best friend's mother. I don't know if I will ever have it in me to tackle this second book. It will take weeks before I can even think about getting to page three.
0399157565|2.0|Once again, I felt I compelled to give Kay Scarpetta ONE MORE CHANCE!  And once again, it's a major disappointment.  What in the world is wrong with you Ms Cornwell??  Your wonderful, strong, interesting, and tremendously admirable character has become paranoid, whiney, sanctimonious, and so difficult to like any more!  Kay Scarpetta is always a victim now-- \\"Oh poor me, everyone hates me or is against me or wants to deceive me, or wants to take advantage of me!\\"  God, please,  NO MORE!  It was all I could do to plow through this latest disappointment.  I kept hoping it would get better.<br />And it never did, nor did the last one before this book, or the one before that.  I am so sad to have to say this, but I am giving up on what was once my most favorite character in all of modern literature!  I think It all started to go downhill when Kay left Richmond, VA.  Now, she's like a nomad with no home--first in NYC for a while and now Boston.  Where next?  She has such a draining, depressing relationship with Lucy now, too, and Marino has turned into a disgusting, gross moron who Kay just barely tolerates.<br />I have read (and loved) this character from the very beginning, but with a real sadness I have to say I am done.  I feel like I have lost a friend....

B004K7HMJ6|3.0|Jessie J got a strong promotional push in the US from her label - she seemed to be absolutely everywhere in 2011 but I really didn't pay her too much attention until I saw her perform on Saturday Night Live.  I was very impressed by her vocal skills and felt that her album would probably be as good as the songs she performed...well, i was kinda right.<br /><br />As debut albums go, it does what it's supposed to do - showcase her voice by having her sing around a variety of musical genres but I'm not quite sure of who she actually intends to be as an artist.  There is no signature \\"Jessie J\\" sound, just her singing very well on tracks that ran the gamut from r&b/pop, pop power ballads & a little bit of hip hop which lends variety to the album - each song is distinct in its production so as a listener I was not bored. I will also say that the songs I like, I REALLY like & the songs I hate, I REALLY REALLY hate so with that being said my faves are:<br /><br />PRICE TAG - love this melodically low key track and the message behind the song;<br />NOBODY'S PERFECT - another melodic winner;<br />ABRACADABRA - love this 80's r&b-ish track;<br />BIG WHITE ROOM - although some of her runs are a bit indulgent, she really shows off  her vocal range on this stripped down live track;<br />CASUALTY OF LOVE - nice melodic beat that's not quite a ballad;<br />RAINBOW - catchy track on which she raps a little<br /><br />Note that these are the first 6 tracks of the albums so I was really hyped about it but it went downhill from there for me and of the remaining tracks, I only really like: I NEED THIS.<br /><br />I really hate: DO IT LIKE A DUDE - the profanity, production & lyrics are just...NO;<br />MAMA KNOWS BEST - sounds like a Christina Aguilera reject and doesn't flow with the rest of the album at all; STAND UP & WHO'S LAUGHING NOW - two anthemic tracks, the 1st seems aimed at uplifting teens while the second seems aimed at those who teased her back in the day (WHO'S has catchier beats but although only 3:54, it felt interminable & I couldn't wait for it to end); L.O.V.E. - filler-ish, repetitive & unremarkable in any way and finally WHO YOU ARE - an overwrought anthemic ballad.<br /><br />The album overall is very uneven but it introduced me to a very talented young singer/songwriter who I believe will go all out on her sophomore album to create a more cohesive total album by trimming the filler and letting us know who she truly is and intends to be as an artist.  On the totally superficial side - I LOVE her album cover, she looks amazing! Her hair & the makeup are stunningly eye catching.r beats but although only 3:54, it felt interminable & I couldn't wait for it to end); L.O.V.E. - filler-ish, repetitive & unremarkable in any way and finally WHO YOU ARE - an overwrought anthemic ballad.<br /><br />The album overall is very uneven but it introduced me to a very talented young singer/songwriter who I believe will go all out on her sophomore album to create a more cohesive total album by trimming the filler and letting us know who she truly is and intends to be as an artist.

1607066017|4.0|Most people picked up Saga because it was the return of lauded Brian K Vaughn. It was Fiona Staples modern and crisp artwork that made me. What can you say about an artist who brings such clarity and depth to her work that even very alien characters convey emotion with their bodies as much as the humans. Also, hello a comic where the faces say as much, and sometimes more, as the speech bubbles? Read Saga for the story but linger over each page because of Fiona Staples' art and ability to render a beautiful and horrifying world. (Also this is sooo not for kids. Mature readers only. Really.)

Most are hidden object.  But lots are find the differences, match pairs, and match cards to reveal the object underneath.  Highly enjoyable.<br /><br />I like that you can 'pinch' to enlarge the screen.  There are unlimited helps but it takes about 90 seconds to regenerate.  There is a skip for the minigames available after 3 minutes.<br /><br />Very addictive and well worth the money for the full version.
0156421178|5.0|Although Orwell's first-hand account of his experience in the leftist militia during the first year of the Spanish Civil War takes place 75 years ago, well before many of us were born, his account has direct application to our world today, and even here in the United States of America. This book is not just an account of the facts that happened in 1936-1937, it is an account of very real and very painful and deadly political mistrust, even in people that are supposedly one's allies. It is about the enormous difference between truth and the intentional and malicious propaganda that people, organizations and the media create to tell \\"their\\" story (instead of the truth). It is about how people choose to disrespect each other and treat each other worse than a vicious animal, not because of what one did to potentially merit such treatment but because of who they are and what group they belong to.<br /><br />And it is also a story of how Orwell dealt with such a disillusionment. Lionel Trilling states in the introduction, \\"He told the truth and he told it in an exemplary way, quietly, simply, with due warning to the reader that it was only one man's truth. He used no political jargon and he made no recriminations.\\" He had plenty of reasons to be hateful and bitter and to reflect that in his writing, but he chose not to. That is what makes this book so unique and especially today. We live in a world where we are overloaded with data and information. Watching and listening to all of the advertisements of both candidates for President that have been bombarding the airwaves, especially in \\"swing\\" states like Virginia shows me how unique Orwell was in his writing. Our world is full of political jargon and recriminations. The truth? Often hidden. Often intentionally. Quite the opposite of Orwell's approach.<br /><br />The horrors and atrocities that happened in that Civil War are happening today in the world. Look at Syria, for example. Situations like those described in his book and like are happening elsewhere in the world often start with the loss of civil liberties. Some say that we are starting to see some of our civil liberties be eroded in this country. Read this book and see what happens when those civil liberties are attacked or taken. It's not just the fighting and shooting at each other. It is how we start to treat each other. See it in this book and think about today. And then think about how we would act in such situations. Would we act and move forward objectively without hatred and without recriminations as Orwell did? The fact that the book can lead you to think about questions like that is what makes Orwell's writing unique and very timely, even in 2012.

B000002KDM|5.0|For my money, this remains James Taylor's most enjoyable album.<br /><br />Though Taylor's cover of Carol King's song is historic, his lullaby \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" remains my favorite of his songs even after 40 years. While much of his later albums leaned hard toward a poppiness I find less appealing, this one branches off into a bluegrassy feel in \\"Riding on a Railroad\\" and a wonderful blues social commentary in \\"Machine Gun Kelly.\\" And I'm afraid he never recaptured the ethereal feel of \\"Places in My Past\\" and \\"Long Ago and Far Away\\" in quite the same way.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I own all of the Reacher novels. Some are better than others, but all are well written. This book was a slow starter. The first hunderd pages were ponderous, but the pay off was worth the wait. I would like to see more plot progression in Reacher's life. This seemed like yet another interlude with a generic villain, just another roadblock in Reacher's desire to arrive in Virginia. The story itself was good, just disappointed that I will have to wait a year for more developments. That is actually a compliment to the writer for creating a character so many people are interested in.<br /><br />P.S. One final note: Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher!

0486414124|3.0|It's not surprising that \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is Jane Austen's first novel. It's not quite pulled together as smoothly as her more famous and well-regarded works, and the dialogue is stilted at times.  However, the novel is still enjoyable enough that it's worth investing the time to read its mere 200 pages.<br /><br />Beginning novelists are told to \\"write what you know,\\" and a young Jane Austen followed that advice.  \\"Northanger Abbey\\" tells the tale of a 17-year-old girl (Catherine) of a respectable family that lives in the countryside. Catherine is given her first real opportunity to see life beyond her rural village when she's asked to accompany an older couple on a six-week trip to Bath.  Once there, Catherine is introduced to \\"society,\\" and her naive, straightforward way of looking at the actions and words of society people provides for satire and criticism of the pretensions of upper-crust life at the time.<br /><br />Many things are skewered, such as the idleness of time spent at bath, the lemming-like surges of people to the same places at the same time, and the rigid rules for manners and conduct that must be learned.  But perhaps the thing most satirized is women.  For example, Catherine's benefactor, Mrs. Allen, spends all of her time shopping for clothes and marking every occasion by what she and others are wearing.  Also, Catherine's first Bath acquaintance, Isabella, constantly says one thing when she means the exact opposite and is always on the lookout for a new angle. (Remarkable how those traits continue today to be the primary cliches about how women spend their free time.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, Catherine stands in opposition to those two foolish women.  Though not a beauty, she attracts the attention of two men.  One is Isabella's brother John, who is a ridiculously boastful ass.  Catherine quickly sees through his bluster.  The other, Mr. Tilney, is a charmer who turns out to be a genuine gentleman.  Things ultimately work out for Catherine andMr. Tilney to live happily ever after, despite the machinations of John and some misunderstandings that involve Isabella, as well as Catherine's brother, and Tilney's sister Eleanor.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said that the book satirizes the gothic romances that were popular at the time, and I guess that critique is true.  Austen goes to great pains to humorously distinguish the plot of her book from the intensity of those novels, and she makes it clear that her book is rooted in reality, not the supernatural realm that is the domain of the gothic.<br /><br />However, I detected a great deal of respect for those types of books.  The narrator does attack gothic novels, and Austen also puts criticisms into the mouths of some of the characters.  But she allows her heroine Catherine to defend those books because they: 1) Are enjoyable; and 2) Provide insights into human nature that are not readily available in non-fiction books.  Given that the heroine Catherine is a devotee of gothic novels and that she triumphs in the end, in part because she uses the wisdom of those novels to understand people's motivations, I think that Austen is gentler towards popular fiction than many reviewers suggest.  Isabella and Mr. Tilney, the other two favored characters, also declare their enjoyment of popular novels.  If anything, I think Austen is defending the novels as providing some understanding about human nature, even while mostly serving as diversions for women wealthy enough to have leisure to read.

B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is a surprisingly funny and equally surprisingly touching take on the hillbilly horror genre. Tucker and Dale are good-natured good old boys who encounter a band of rowdy college kids in the woods. There is a misunderstanding based on certain prejudices that both groups have, and hilarity ensures. It's a very gory movie, but in case it's also very funny. Hard to believe, but true. Unlike a lot of movies of this type, it is even funny on repeated viewings. If you get the Blue-Ray or DVD, make sure to watch it again later with the commentary.

These were two priceless gems of perfection!

Half way through the show, I asked my wife if she thought it was like such and such and she laughed at me. Lots of holes in the plot however. Unanswerd questions at the end. It was a good date night movie with the kids gone. Uh, no kids need watch this unless you wanna stay up with them later. You have been warned.

B008OOYALE|1.0|My daughter had this game and had an amazon gift card on her kindle. One day she buys $10 worth of gold on it ans did not recieve what she clicked on but her $10 was gone!! We had to contact amazon customer service to get her money back. Amazon was very kind about it and refunded the money. Now why on earth did we have to go through this? Answer: SCAM!!!!!!!!
B00782O7IY|5.0|you probably are watching a master work of art. Much has been written about the performances of Dujardin and the rest of the cast. Suffice to say that it is a fenomenal movie experience and a wonderful homage to the silent movie era. Besides that, an incredible tour the force of director Hazanavicius. Buy it, watch it, cry, laugh and wonder.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I wish everyone would get the game Subway Surfers because it is spool very awesome everyone should totally get this game super very crazy awesome
B004LP3AYI|4.0|Read this when it first came out and reread the first two books after watching the ABC TV series. It is better than I remembered and will likely continue with the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I haven't found ANY flaws with this app whatsoever. It plays very smoothly without freezing or crashing, and it keeps me very, very entertained.

B009XWD02G|1.0|all this app does is act like its searching for songs. It constantly has ad pop ups everywhere. Do not download it doesn't even let you download songs. It also asks that you participate in offers before you can open the app. Suxxx!!!
B0034DGPEU|1.0|The book was poorly written, characters had no depth  just basically a fluff piece of work. It was a waste of my time
B00011KHTM|5.0|This adapter worked instantly to get my 2008 macbook (broken screen) on a generic brand (I-inc) vga monitor.  The plug does come out easily as some other reviews said, however when put on a stable platform it's great.  My screen fix would have been over $200 and this was a much better option for me even though I sacrificed portability and can't use the laptop on my lap.  Overall, I'm very pleased!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I've heard a lot of negativity regarding Muse's new album in comparison with their past work. I actually enjoyed the new album.<br />Perhaps this is because I accept the fact that not all of the new songs are in the same style and I believe that is what bothers some people.<br />  I'll admit there is one song that I skip past because I don't like it all that much but I think that if you listen to an album expecting to love every song you're expecting too much from anyone.<br />They are amazing live btw.
B004I744AS|3.0|i will use this often as i have started reading book fom the 1920's. they used words that cannot always gain meaning fom the text.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was entertaining but still very predicable. It's good for a quick read :) I mostly read it because I wanted to see how closely it followed twilight, and it was pretty close.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I finished this book days ago and I cannot seem to get it out of my mind.  Reading Dark Places was like being in a emotionally abusive relationship by the ups and downs or staring at a horrific car accident...you know you shouldn't but you just can't help it.  It was like watching a horror movie right before the blonde chick with giant breasts is about to get sliced and diced by a chainsaw...you think you know what is about to happen and it's nearly unbearable to watch but you have to peek between your fingers just in case.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I'm in absolute love with this author.  Happy reading!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|me and my older sister love this game. the only problem is that if you don't play it, it takes nine minutes to regenerate one coin, where as while you play it, it only takes thirty seconds. other then that, you should get it.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|I'm not a fan of puzzle games, so I was a bit weary of trying this game. Now, I must play for at least an hour before going to bed every night. Unlike other puzzle games, this actually has an element of challenge while providing a wonderful balance between luck and skill.
0316228532|2.0|I will admit upfront, I read the HP series. My reading enjoyments are widely varied, however, so I started this book with an open mind and no expectations other than I like this author's previous works.<br /><br />It was so slow to start and it took time to become familiar and keep track of the characters. By half way through the book I had to finish it - to find out how it ended, not because I was enjoying it. The ending left me sad and hollow. . . . I didn't enjoy this book at all.<br /><br />I still like JK's writing style a great deal and hope she continues to pick up the pen. It wasn't a book I enjoyed, but certainly others did. Perhaps I will like the next one.

B009VA1FN6|5.0|The Secret Keeper is the fourth novel from popular Australian author Kate Morton, whose previous books such as the The House At Riverton and The Forgotten Garden, have enjoyed international success.<br /><br />In the Secret Keeper, Morton grabs the reader's attention with the first chapter as sixteen year old Laurel witnesses a tragic altercation between her mother and a stranger. Nearly fifty years later Laurel's latent curiosity prompts her to investigate Dorothy's past, inspired by an inscription in a copy of a Peter Pan, a photo of Dolly linking arms with a friend, Vivian, and the vague whispers of her dying mother, slowly piecing together an extraordinary story.<br /><br />As the narrative shifts between Laurel's search into her mother's past in present-day England to London during the Blitz, the reader is witness to Dorothy's life. A headstrong and vivacious teenager, Dolly flees her staid family to make a life for herself in London, certain she is destined to become something special. She imagines having a life of luxury, social standing and wealth, like that enjoyed by Vivian Jenkins, which seems possible when she becomes the companion of the rich, eccentric and elderly, Lady Gwendolyn but when Dolly's dreams sour, she is devastated. Despite the adoration of her boyfriend, Jimmy, Dolly concocts a plan to claim what she believes is her destiny, triggering a cascade of events that lead to tragedy.<br /><br />In a vividly drawn setting, Morton creates a cast of intriguing, believable characters who are motivated by wistful dreams and dark secrets. As their relationships unraveled and the plot grew more intricate I was drawn into the twists and turns of the story, that leads to a stunning conclusion that will take most readers by surprise.<br /><br />Finely crafted, The Secret Keeper is both an engrossing mystery and a sweeping historical saga. A compelling tale of love, loss and betrayal this is a wonderful read from a gifted storyteller.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game because there all kinds of different games that you can play and that is why this game is really good
B0000062FJ|5.0|Mexican-born guitarist Carlos Santana and the wild percussionists on this album introduce such an incredible Latino timbre to their music that would remain as their signature sound over the years. Santana got their big break and made their mark from their stellar performance at Woodstock which would launch their debut album to unparalleled heights with tracks like Soul Sacrifice.<br /><br />Many songs on their premier offering are still being played today, that's over 40 years later from the release date. The high energy Latin Rock combining with many other genres of music such as jazz and blues makes this a unique sound.<br /><br />This is a legendary album and it's a must have to add to anybody's CD collection. Early works of Carlos Santana are what his music is all about, not the commercial offerings of his later works.<br /><br />The bands interplay is fresh,the musicianship is tight, this is a top notch instrumental jam release which was the beginning of great things to come, such as the \\"Abraxas\\" album that followed in 1970.<br /><br />Musicians<br />* Carlos Santana..guitars,vocals<br />* Gregg Rolie..Keyboards,vocals<br />* Michael Shrieve..Drums<br />* David Brown..Bass<br />* Michael Carabello..Congas<br />* Jose 'Chepito' Areas..Timbales,congas,percussion<br /><br />Santana was the first band to offer an exciting melting pot of (bluesy) rock, jazz and Latin roots. This is their best.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|I saw this tour live and man the movie was better to watch. You get to see them up close and being a guitarist and getting a glimpse at The Edge's guitar settings is really cool. Bono is definatly getting old ...totally sucks ...wish those 4 could stay young his voice was really awesome on the Zoo TV tour but that tour took it's toll on his vocal chords. I noticed that some songs had to be detuned a half step so he could sing it. ahhhh life gotta love it but sometimes really dislike the getting old part.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This book is a classic a must read for everyone the characters are very good  I liked silver and ben gunn the most
B0087ITC56|5.0|A Pilot with a substance-abuse problem, Denzel Washington has to land a crippled airliner. This is not only one of the most thrilling movies in 2012, but the Acting Performance of Denzel Washington is once again, Outstanding! The entire cast is Superb in Acting, Special Effects are awesome, and this film is one of the Best in the topic of harrowing Air Disasters. There is intense suspense in the first 20 minutes, which has you mesmerized for the unexpected dramatic events as you sit on the edge-of-your seat. In addition, this flawless movie is entertaining from start to finish, and is as chilling as it is inspiring. The intriguing story is Excellent as Denzel Washington portrays a brilliant, cunning performance as well as he did in 'Along Came A Spider and Kiss The Girls!' His unique acting-style is breathtaking and 'FLIGHT\\" was worth every penny for the movie ticket. His complex role in this film has you addicted to the story immediately as we anticipate what will happen in one of the most in-flight disaster depictions of all time. Denzel Washington once again aims to please his viewers, and does it in flying colors. I expected him to come through, that's why I've watched almost every movie he has been in. One of my favorite actors, who never disappoints. The action is explosive, and as we learn about the Pilot's addiction to alcohol and cocaine, the suspense has you craving for more. This is one drama I would watch again-and-again. A Must-Have for my DVD collection. Enjoyable and Highly Recommended to all thriller lovers!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Easy to put together but abit more complicated to use.  Our first bottle came out great but the second one cracked.  I think I applied too much presure.  But it's really easy to use & will make a great craft project at the campground. Luckily we've have plenty of bottles to practice on.

0316228532|1.0|This is going to be a short review.  I loved Rowling's Harry Potter series of books, but this was the worst book I have ever \\"tried\\" to read.  I got about halfway through it and realized there was no plot at all.  It was just page after unnecessary page of \\"blah\\".  I finally fast forwarded to the last 3 chapters and still it was boring me to death. I probably could have made myself sit and read the complete book, but why bother?  I hated every single one of the characters and frankly didn't care if they all were killed by some mass murderer.  At least that would have made it interesting! But no, it just went on and on with the ridiculously boring, selfish, dysfunctional and loathsome people! I feel like I need to wash my eyes after delving half way into it to remove the filth and sadness they endured.<br /><br />If you are a fan of J. K. Rowling, then don't waste your money on this book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much flowed nicely, and kept you wanting more.  I stayed up late too many nights reading.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Fun read with very good character development and riveting storyline. It will be interesting to see what comes next in this strange world.
B0007N1BBC|1.0|I was so very disappointed in this purchase.  I would advise every American not to purchase this DVD as it will only play in Region 2, which means it will not play in Region 1 - The United States of America.  How ridiculous is that.  This purchase cost me $9.00 with shipping and to send it back was another $4.00 plus, so it was a total loss to me.  I would highly recommend not buying this product unless you live in the UK or Australia which is \\"Region 2.\\"
B0032UYFA6|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is currently struggling with \\"Deadwood\\" for the spot as my all-time favorite TV show -- no making a final judgment til the end, though \\"Deadwood\\" was killed prematurely, so it may not be fair even then. And I never thought I'd ever see a show that could rival \\"Deadwood\\" for sheer violent brilliance. Whatever my final favorite, BB must be ranked very, very high amongst the best TV shows ever aired. The dialogue -- the use of music -- the editing -- the cinematography -- the acting -- every award is well deserved.<br /><br />Watching the transformation of Walter White from milquetoast to murderer, a man discovering, and loving, the darkness within himself, is fascinating. These kinds of stories always fascinate me, but here, it's exceptionally well done. It's so mesmerizing as the roles of Walt and Jesse reverse across the course of seasons. Jesse is, at first, the loser meth-cooking f**k-up, Walt the unappreciated genius chemist who's trying to provide for his family. Gradually, Jesse becomes the unexpected moral anchor. He's done terrible things, but unlike Walt, he's bothered by them. Walt, on the other hand, becomes addicted to the power he discovers as he makes himself into a drug kingpin.<br /><br />There are so many other reversals as the series progresses. Marie from bitchy, uptight kleptomaniac to truly caring sister. Hank from clownish buffoon to tough but sensitive, sharp yet somehow blind DEA agent, always so close to the truth (what a great character -- I'm glad Aaron Paul got his Emmy, but so should Dean Norris!). Skyler from nagging housewife to terrified half-hostage. And peripheral, but still important, Saul Goodman from flashy arrogance to battered-lawyer syndrome. Gus Fring from polite businessman to ruthless throat-cutting drug lord.<br /><br />I can't wait to see how this series ends. I'm p-o'd that we have to wait til next July for the conclusion. I am glad, though, that V. Gilligan is concluding this -- it's not a story that couldgo on indefinitely -- and I will trust him to make the right moves -- he's made very few wrong ones thus far.
B0031R5K72|4.0|I enjoyed the clever style of this book. Would not usually read books set in wartime, but this has a warm human appeal.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I've been told it is worth the read but so far I'm having difficulty getting though it. I've read several books since starting this one and I'm not sure if I'll get back to it.
0316228532|1.0|This book was so depressing.  I did not like one character, was not rooting for one character and could not find a reason to care about their depressing lives.  If I was not reading it for my book club I would have stopped reading it because it made me feel so depressed every time I picked it up.<br /><br />I have not read any of the Harry Potter books so I had no expectations going in.  I also don't want to sound like because it wasn't all sunshine and roses, that is why I didn't like it.  I just don't think JK gave us a reason to empathize with any of the characters, to root for any of the characters, or to understand why they are they are.<br /><br />The only exception to this is Terry and Crystal.  JK gave us some insight as to the root of their struggles. This allowed me to hope they somehow made it through.  But I cannot say the same about any other character.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said the book really makes you think.  Think what?  We don't have any insight as to why they are the way they are, how they have or will grow from their experiences, why we should or should not root for them or want them to fail.  What was the point of any of it?  They're just miserable, unlikeable characters and I was not moved to think anything beyond that.<br /><br />And I do not understand how anyone out there found ANY humor in this book.  I did not laugh once (or cry once for that matter).<br /><br />JK did paint a vivid picture and I can tell she's a good writer.  I just did not enjoy the book.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|3.5 stars. Don't get me wrong, this is still a very enjoyable pop album, but coming after Continuum, it's a serious let down for me. Had he followed up Continuum with another strong bluesy album, his career could have been in totally another level by now, look at Adele, Amy Winehouse. You need at least a couple of stellar albums in a similar vein to establish your signature sound. Battle Studies feels like a step backward falling back on pure pop sound.
B005MVJM3I|5.0|There aren't many things that can be said negative about this album.  All the songs sound different, which, if you have bought any albums in the last 10 years, is quite a feat.  Frankly, this album is amazing.
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|I have been reading Alistair Reynold's writing for at least 10 years, and have read the bulk of his published works.  His last few books have not taken place in the \\"Revelation Space\\" universe, and I've seen some complaints from his fans that the last few books, such as Century Rain, have not been as good as his previous work.  (I am not one of this complainers.)  However, I have read through BRE over the last few days, and I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />I think this latest novel is a step above Reynold's last couple of books in terms of writing quality and in story telling.  I think his choosing to set the novels and characters in a future Africa was an excellent idea, and it works very well.  I thought the characters, ideas, and action were all entertaining, and I look forward to reading the next book in this new \\"Poseidon's Children\\" series.
B009VB97EY|1.0|this movie sucked beyond all belief. props to their trailer editor and their personal trainers who managed to make this look like a potentially light and fun movie.
1455502758|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Christopher's last book. His brilliant mind and stunning ability to communicate to the reader was really captured here. The only thing I wish is that it was less redundant. A lot of his writing and thoughts in Mortality can be found in published articles (through Vanity Fair for example). Though this was likely a time factor. His writing will surely not go un-missed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. it is very useful. no problems.  it is nice to know how much time you have on your battery.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really loved reading about the life of a Navy Seal.  First, how difficult it is to become a Navy Seal and then what it is like on any mission. It was so interesting to learn firsthand what the Navy Seals went through in getting Bin Laden, fascinating!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great gameplay. Two sided narrative is fun option. You don't have to buy stuff to win levels. Challenging without being impossible. Clean graphics. Good music. Plays well on my Droid X2 with some crashes. Big file if not on tablet.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works well. Even talks to u by telling u how much u have left and how much it had charged.  It is free and no problems.
B009JZPH32|4.0|It seems most of the reviewers came into this movie with high expectations based on reading the book, or as director fans. I found it a gritty, thought provoking movie with some hot scenes added to the mix. Perhaps not the \\"best movie of the year\\", but certainly worth your time if you find the trailer appealing. It's not an easy movie to watch, but far better in quality than most movies that float across Amazon Instant these days.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Very Good movie. What a daddy won't do for his daughter. Can't wait until Taken 2 comes out of video.
B004G5Z0DW|5.0|Hi<br />it is A Real good movie .I Will watch it again this Easter. I like ordering from here so much<br /><br />Love,Missy
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Dear Amazon, I am very disappointed in this book. I ordered the free sample and thought it would be a good romance and when I received the full book and it became a kinky sex story I was very disappointed and erased it from my kindle.  Do you not have a way of rating so I do not have to do this again.  If you do not I will not order another book. goodbye.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Fantastic book - beautifully written and so descriptive you feel you are in the parks in San Fran. All the emotions are there--fear, happiness, anger, but most of all love for Victoria. Cannot recommend to my daughter(due with 1st baby in Dec) until next year!! Sure hope to see more from this author.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|It's a fun game. I'm glad I didn't pay for it because I probably won't play it a lot but I won't delete it either because my grandkids would love it.  I wish we could give half stars because I'd give this game 3 and 1/2 stars.
B0091REZMW|3.0|i enjoy the challenges of all the different ways of searching for the objects. its fun to visit friends and to give and receive gifts to and from them. all in all this game is fun!!
B005LAIIE4|5.0|The Short: Wreck-It Ralph is a classic. From the slick animation, the great sense of humor, nostalgia inducing references and cameos, and the surprisingly adept and emotional story, Disney's Wreck-it Ralph is the best animated comedy since Tangled, and one of Disney's best animated films ever crafted.<br /><br />Street Fighter, Pac-Man, Q-bert; widely known and considered classic games. But a \\"new challenger has entered the ring\\" in the form of old school, Donkey Kong inspired retro arcade game, Wreck-it Ralph. Follow the misadventures of Wreck-it Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, as he attempts to become a hero by jumping though various video games. I don't want to spoil any of the plot, but it is incredibly well told and is quite surprising in the end. It has that classic Disney emotion, but with a most unique \\"video game-y\\" twist. In the end, Wreck-it Ralph teaches some great lessons, but it is also neither mundane nor juvenile, and that's why it's a winner.<br /><br />The cast here couldn't fit the characters better. John C. Reilly as the big guy Wreck-it Ralph, Sarah Silverman as the spirited and surprisingly funny Vanellope von Schweetz, Jane Lynch as the stoic and hilarious Sergeant Calhoun, and Jack McBrayer as the lovable and yet again laugh- out-loud Fix-it Felix Junior. The movie is absolutely hilarious; the performances from all of the actors fit their roles perfectly and couldn't be funnier. They couldn't have picked a better voice cast, honestly to goodness.<br /><br />The animation continues the high pedigree that Disney has become famous for. Its bright and lively action is wonderful to watch, and combined with great facial animations make for a great and emotional experience. But the winner here is the way that they have adapted the old- school style of video game animation into the film itself. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. It makes for a truly unique, one of a kind experience! Sony's 4K presentation is crisp and vibrant.<br /><br />The thing to understand though is that with its focus on video game cameos and references, don't worry! You don't have to have any knowledge of video games to understand or enjoy Wreck-it Ralph. The story and main characters are all part of the film's story and world. Rather than using the references as a crutch, they're used more as a springboard into new and unexplored fictional worlds.<br /><br />Granted, gamers of all ages are going to love the care and attention taken when putting in the huge amount of references, cameos, and little bits of easter eggs spritzed and scattered throughout Wreck-it Ralph, making for a truly nostalgic inducing experience.<br /><br />And those classic Disney trademarks, from great characters to a well told story, are all here and are much more than side attractions. The twist is great, the concepts are fresh, and the level of imagination at work revives my faith in the animated genre. There's still plenty left in this old dog after all.<br /><br />And so I have to end this review by asking, \\"Are you tired of the same old washed up animated feature film? Feel like you're just too old for childish animated movies?\\" Wreck-it Ralph is the perfect cure. And it's meant for that group of movie goers looking for something more than just another animated money pit. It's laugh out loud funny, exciting and fresh, incredibly inventive and gleefully unique at every turn.<br /><br />It's a classic no doubt, and Wreck-it Ralph will be one of those movies on my \\"favorites\\" shelf for decades to come. The true triumph? Wreck-it Ralph feels like that classic game that has been a part of my childhood ever since I can remember; the type of classic where you throw hundreds of quarters away and you honestly just don't care, because it is just that good.<br /><br />5/5 - Perfection; Stop reading and watch right now/>The thing to understand though is that with its focus on video game cameos and references, don't worry!

0792842731|5.0|I have always liked Brosnan's Bond films the best because they always have plenty of action through out and the graphics are very good. This movie is definitely pro BMW. A very impressive BMW car and a BMW motorcycle later on. To bad that the motorcycle was not outfitted with Q's gadgets.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|Nice brick breaker game play. Simple wth good control and bright colorful graphics also a relatively small file that moves to the SD-card if you want.<br /><br />My only problem with this game is that it doesn't save your progress. This is the perfect game for burning short bursts of time but unless you set down and devote an hour or better playing it through your going to always start over on the same old beginning levels. Even worse is the fact you'll never play up to your high score potential or have a record score to beat. No save option makes no sense on any on the go smartphone device.<br /><br />Good looking and nice playing game... uninstalled and 3-stars until the frustration factor is fixed with the ability to save and play through.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So addictive, lots of fun and challenging levels. Great game for those who actually have a brain :) Levels range in difficulty from so easy a two yr old could do it, to screw it its too hard. I highly reccimend this game, great way to waste time if your bored.
0374214913|5.0|Old books, modern technology, and a quest... This book is engaging at so many levels! It is a quest story along the lines of the  DaVinci code or any number of fantasy novels...and the lead character regularly frames it that way. It is also a story about modern information technology, and the possibilities for using it to make new discoveries through everything from Google (which plays a role in the story) to crowd-sourcing.<br /><br />The author's style is charming, full of sly references to popular culture that are woven into the story and move it forward, and don't overwhelm of become annoying. The humor can be subtle, and it certainly helps to be familiar with some of what goes on in science fiction and fantasy novels, movies, gaming, and info tech circles--but it isn't necessary. I really like the main character--he's not heroic but so enthusiastic in the way he throws himself into the question and drags his friends along.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down.

B0066WJLU6|4.0|It works well. Very useful; especially when I don't need to turn on much brighter lights when loved ones are sleeping.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was not a book for me at all.  It does explore the dark side of a relationship and I read no more after I figured out what is was about. I will be deleting this from my books.
B008M34INW|5.0|Get The Gringo follows The Gringo (Mel Gibson) as he escapes into Mexico after stealing a large amount of money from a crime boss; he ends up in a city-like prison in Mexico, where he meets and helps a young boy who is wanted for his rare blood type liver. The story is a bit deeper than that, but I don't want to spoil or prolong this review anymore.<br /><br />The story is great; it blends action, drama, and dark humor with excellence. The action is beautifully shot, the drama is well told, and the comedy doesn't feel forced. The movie is serious, but knows the right time to be fun; consequently, the film's pace is fast and balanced. Mel Gibson does an excellent job as The Gringo; he does a great and amusing Clint Eastwood impression in the movie, as well. The rest of the cast was also great. Tradition Mexican music is played often during the film, and I enjoyed it because it effectively complimented the settings, which was also very well used. The ending doesn't stray far from what we've seen before, but it's not bad; in fact, the final sequence in the prison is action-packed and suspenseful. Also, the film is in both English and Spanish (with subtitles), it's mostly English, though.<br /><br />Overall, Get The Gringo is an amazing action/drama/comedy film that effectively blends and balances all of these genres. As of 11/4/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is also recommended.<br /><br />Get The Gringo has strong violence and gore. No sex or nudity.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. The puzzles and prizes keep me playing. The physics seem very realistic too. Some of the prizes and puzzle pieces have actual weight to them. As you level, your max number of coins will increase too. I find I can easily play for a half hour with only 60 some starting coins.
0345529057|5.0|Not too long ago I ordered the box set of a song of ice and fire books 1-4. I was really excited to start reading the books after I watched the television show. Amazon.com didn't disappoint, they shipped my package the same day I ordered it. It arrived at my door a couple of days later, exactly when the shipping tracker said it would. When I opened the box I was pleased to see that they took the time and precaution to protect what was inside. Also I appreciate the fact that the box wasn't oversized for what was inside, amazon didn't waste materials. I am also very pleased with the price of the list item. Amazon often has discount prices on things that I want to purchase which is also why I decided to order from the website. I am very pleased with my experience and honestly don't have any negatives to express. I realize this looks like an advertisement for amazon, and I don't want to come across like someone who works for amazon, or is paid to advertise for them. The only thing I can write to refute that for anyone reading this is that I am a real person, who has no affiliation to amazon. I honestly enjoyed my purchase so much that I has to write a review about my experience. My purchase arrived on time, undamaged, and at a reasonable price. You can't ask for better service than that!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. I learned recently that this was a prequel to the Aliens movies, this only enhanced my experience. The characters in the movie played their roles perfectly and I plan on watching this movie repeatedly.

1449410243|5.0|This makes a great coffee table book to pick up and open at any page! It's a good conversation starter, its detail of ideas and drawings is both adult and childish!<br />I enjoyed the humour, the size of the book, the quality of the printing, and the content. I did buy it for a gift to my partner with the knowledge that I'd be the first to read it. I will be purchasing other books from this [[ASIN:1449410243 How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You]] artist/writer!
B009KHBDUU|1.0|I rented it and never watched it, happens most of the time rent movies and don't Getty to watch.  I usually forget I rent these and  forget I rented.  I hard it was a comedy and I think the old scary one would be better
B009AMAM9S|1.0|Total gay agenda, I was appalled, racism, sexism, and agism shouldn't be associated with sexual preference. Very obvious agenda tied through entire show, not a story-line, an agenda which adds to the demise of this nation.I believe the movie ended with words from Aleister Crowley \\"Do what thou wilt\\" the founder of the occult religion thelema. In a so called \\"Christian\\" society, we have forsaken Christian values and biblical teachings and replaced it with a liberal world view. True love is to speak the truth with a broken heart not to accept the lies with a smile. I therefore found this movie very offensive not uplifting or optimistic.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very additive game once you start playing you look up and hours have past make sure you try and get as many gifts of the same
B008I34YCG|5.0|The new re-release of Frank Zappa's brilliant The Grand Wazoo is nothing short of wonderful.  I've been buying them all in order (Overnight Sensation is next!), since they started coming out in July of 2012, and they've pretty much all been an improvement over the previous CD versions.  I have to say though, that I don't know what some of these other folks are talking about when they say their copies of this CD won't play on their CD, DVD or blu-ray players.  I had no problem playing it on my (Bose) CD player at all!  Maybe there were problems in the manufacturing of the disc at first though.  Because $35.00 is a ridiculously high price to pay for any single CD, even one as great as the Grand Wazoo.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|No permission issues, no problems running or controlling. Might be the first 5 star I've given an app. Nice redo of a classic.

B007EECSFA|5.0|I don't know if it is just me but I have been having a difficult time finding good books lately. Thankfully I picked up The Secret Keeper last week and am enjoying reading again. It is such a good read. The twists and turns are great. I honestly didn't expect several/most of the turns.... There were so many surprises I want to read it again to see if I could follow it better now that I know the secrets. Very very good writing. I highly recommend this book.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|A friend referred me to this movie so I watched it. I am so happy I took his advice! The movie inspires such romance and the passion and music touched me to the core in such a profound way.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|\\"Taken\\" is a very good film for those who really like a lot of martial arts and action films. Liam Neeson is a\\"retired government employee\\" who over the course of his many years had acquired \\"special skills\\"; which is exactly what he uses to rescue his teenage daughter from Albanian human traffickers in Paris. When he encounters many \\"bad guys\\" in a particular spot, it didn't matter to him if it was 4 or 9; he could take them all on! Liam Neeson is of course known to many Sci-Fi fans from the 2nd set of \\"Star Wars\\" films; and earlier than that he played the lead in \\"Darkman\\".

My teenagers listen to it all the time as they do their homework and my two younger ones listen to it every night as they are going to sleep.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|It's the fact that she can go across borders and fuse different styles and make it sound good...really good.  Her songs remind me of my younger days as I am the free spirited type... Her voice is striking and does not sound as if it was contrived by a machine... Her lyrics match the melodies and beats and can take me away to a time that was about living life and enjoying every moment of it....
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As usual this Jack Reacher book was very riveting. I don't understand how Tom Cruise can be playing this character because he doesn't at all fit the physical description. I'd like to know how the author feels about this.

B000MD9UJC|4.0|You get an LED flashlight and you have the option of using the push-button tail cap or the same one that it had, so you can either set the focus and push the button to the same focus, or you can leave the old tail cap on and use the twist focus to turn it on and focus. It's not an important point to me, since I use it for blackout reading and finding things. The big selling point was the increase in battery life. As another reviewer pointed out, you can skip the conversion and just get a new LED flashlight for a few dollars more. I have not compared the converted one to a new one. I took off one star because you really don't need to pay for a push-button tail cap. You can use the old one. They should have sold just a reflector and bulb for half the price. Too expensive to buy both if you don't need them=minor ripoff.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I am a huge \\"Aliens\\" series fan, so I was very interested in seeing this movie - following the very limited distribution to theaters I finally rented it last week. Effects and CGI are first-rate, and there are characters I really enjoyed. That's it from me, any more would lead to a \\"Spoiler\\"...
B008S4FZHI|5.0|Another outstanding chronicle from Patricia Cornwell.  Twists and turns throughout making it a great read.  Can't wait for the next adventure.
1476712042|5.0|Just wonderful! So passionate.This genre (\\"50 shades trilogy\\", \\"crossfire series\\" and this one) is delightful.The heroes are so hell-bent on keeping the relationship at all costs that I can hardly blame them when they lose control.Not sugary at all, nothing to do with lectures on morals (I loathe these lectures), just 2 people caught in a world of their own, that nobody else can understand. So what? If it's good enough for them, it's noone else's business.It's an erotic story, after all, not a real-life relationship.
1469984202|3.0|Interesting, well-developed concept. Formulaic, but he follows the formula well, toggling between scenes, building characters and conflict.<br /><br />However, the book desperately needs an editor. Over-written, over-burdened pages could have been reduced to paragraphs without losing tension or story-line. Many an editor has turned a good or even great book into an excellent book. An editor could've helped the author raise the level of this book to a true art form, along the lines of Vinge or even Asimov.<br /><br />It's still a good read, it's just immature.
B005723JSQ|2.0|without giving away any spoilers, I did not like the protagonist of this book.  I kept hoping she would come to her senses but she seemed to just desperately need a man, regardless of how well she knew that man or how well he treated her.  This did not change by the end of the book.  I was enjoying the book for quite some time until I realized where the plot was going and then was just disgusted with the heroine.  and this is a \\"chick lit\\" book so I wasn't expecting War and Peace, but I do expect the heroine/protagonist of the book to at least learn and make better choices by the end of the book.  Not so with this one.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|My son has enjoyed these for the past several years.  I just wish there was a little more variety so that we could continue buying them without recycling past-years.  I fear this may be our last one simply due to there only being a few versions.
B000VECAC6|5.0|So, I'm not religious, but I used to be, and this film is hilarious! There's a couple of scenes that are too silly, but in general the idea is brilliant. &#34;Follow the gourd - no follow his shoe.&#34; ahhhh
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once again a great read can not wait to read the next one but getting scared about the ending!!! Please be good!!
B001P9EQH8|3.0|We really cant complain because its not an expensive item. I use copper monster turbine pro headphones. The headphones by itself are awesome, but i still wanted more bass. The E5 did add a bit of more bass (something i thought wasnt going to happen). Im happy with the item.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there is no way to know when the battery is low. Many times ive left home and 10 minutes later it just turned off on me, having a 3 hour trip to go.
B000S57KVO|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful and eclectic movie soundtracks I have heard. It has a mix of jazz, contemporary, reggae and other music that is just delicious. It also has the one \\"killer track\\" - Sinnerman, from Nina Simone that is one of the most sensational 10 minute pieces of music that I have ever heard. A reggae beat, a singer with a raspy voice, singing this reggae/rock song where it almost sounds like she is a half a beat behind, but actually isn't, and a song with a melody and power that is rarely heard in any music.<br /><br />While I bought this album after hearing \\"Sinnerman\\" in the movie, the rest of the CD is terrific as well.
B009CPES4I|2.0|Fabulous cast, intriguing idea, yet a disappointment. First half is stronger but the second half falls into unbelievable bordering on ridiculous. Total waste of a talented, seasoned cast. Fun to see them together, though. I had higher expectations, and they were certainly not met.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining book I have read in some time.  A diversion from the real world and a delightful insight into history.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|This book is a wonderful portrayal of what do do in the highly unlikely event of a solanum outbreak. Or is it that unlikely? After staying up to 2:00 AM, deeply immersed in the abyss of immense knowledge known as The Zombie Survival Guide, I was left unsure of everything I had ever learned. I was unsure of even the most basic fabrics of reality. Was the government hiding information from me and my fellow countrymen? At the time, eeriely plausible. This book has given me an unquenchable thirst, for knowledge--no, make that an insatisfiyable hunger. Like a zombie is driven to consume human flesh, I wanted to absorb information. Sadly, as Brooks points out in his book, humans need rest. I passed out on my bed after shutting off my kindle and awoke to the comforting thought of: ignorance is bliss. I was afraid of what I might find in the dark realms of the internet. This book is vivid and lush with unquestionable information that may or may not be true but still is presented in a matter of fact way, a way that seems to say: hey, these are the facts and I am the expert. listen to them or die, your choice.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great series! Looking forward to reading more from this author!  Makes you stop and think about what the future world could become
B004478GNI|4.0|It's looks awesome and my 5 years old son loves it.  We had a ball putting it together. 'nuff said.
B003W5C0VM|4.0|Yes, yes it is heavy handed with shots of Mick and yes, the film is a bit grainy in parts, but OMFG, The Rolling Stones and Mick Jagger show you exactly why they're the greatest band in rock and roll history.  This is straight out awesome rock film.  Mick Jagger kicks ass and features the musical stylings of Keith, Charlie, Bill and Mick Taylor - who, by the way plays the most amazing solo on Love in Vain.  It's not to be missed.<br />Favorite song on this Blu-Ray:  Rip This Joint.
B000056TKD|5.0|There isn't much to say beyond the simple fact that 1971 was a great year for Planets recordings.  This stunning, virtuosic performance, which has virtually no weaknesses, and that of Zubin Mehta's first foray into the work (far better than his NYPO effort), recorded in a very different acoustic, have been my desert island interpretations since they appeared.  There isn't anything but pleasure with either performance.  Steinberg has a slight edge due to the eerie acoustic the DG engineers created in Symphony Hall, Boston, a very different sound than Mehta's, which is literally \\"in your face.\\"  They BOTH are worth owning, even in a small collection.  I don't need to go over details; there are few if any criticisms that would negate the deftly positive reviews from almost all the writers here.  For a bonus, Steinberg's equally excellent, slick Zarathustra is also at the top of any short list, again including the CSO-Bouulez interpretation, Karajan's several efforts, Bohm's, and strangely, Haitink's emasculated but elegant version of the work.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game because it is so addictive and i just love to come back to the game evry day and just try to beat my high score so ya... :) la la do do do :)P
0345529057|5.0|I have never had so much fun reading anything else. ASOIAF tells the story of several competing \\"great houses\\" at face value. It grabs hold quickly and from there takes you on a fantastic ride. I have laughed, cried, gotten furious beyond reason and still cannot get enough. But underneath the plights for power, lurks something much bigger than any family. Something that will threaten the entire realm. GRRM has kept me on my toes by showing me just how unsafe every character truly is. His gritty, realistic, character-driven story telling creates a very believable universe where not everything or everyone is exactly what they seem.
B008XCPO2Q|2.0|They should have written the script AND THEN added the stripping aspect.  Instead the focus is on the stripping aspect and the story is an afterthought - like, oh yeah, we need to write dialogue for these people.  And I heartily agree with those who say this is a re-heated Flashdance remake.<br /><br />That being said, Channing Tatum is not to be missed and can dance for me anytime.  OMFG.
B0000041LO|5.0|I'm simply going to second essentially all the raves from the other five-star reviewers. Some complete sets you've got to have: All the Haydn symphonies, all the Haydn string quartets. Well, add to that all his piano trios as well, and these are the performances to own. It's all delightful music, wonderfully played. As a small footnote, I will add that I purchased this item through Amazon within the past month, and what I received was not the packaging currently displayed in the item listing. Instead, the discs came in paper sleeves that sat within a pasteboard box accompanied by a booklet, with different cover graphics, all under the Decca label -- a more recent issue of the same material, and I adore the new packaging. The focus, though, is the music, and this set is a big winner without a doubt.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing but makes u use ur brain. Hope they make more! Bought the other quell which is harder but more please!
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Although the characters were quite sexy, the story was not what I thought it would be.  A big let down considering all the hype it got.  Wish I didn't waste my money.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It is a very durable case. I think it would be cool if it had an easier way for it to stand up it would be better.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|It didn't have an exciting plot but it had some funny moments. It helps to be a Johnny Depp fan.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|I know I am going against the majority of the reviewers here, but this game is more like a 3.5 out of 5 stars rather than 5 stars.<br /><br />Yes, like other reviewers have mentioned, this app has no annoying advertising and has no unnecessary permissions.  It also seems easy enough to play for people of all ages and has several power up-type things to free in the game to make the game more challenging in later levels.<br /><br />However, to give this game 5 stars doesn't make sense when you compare it to the quality of other 5 star apps such as Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, or Where's My Water?.<br /><br />I have to disagree with the other reviewers for other reasons as I found 3 separate things that I didn't like about this app.<br /><br />1. The app sounds are not exciting enough.  If you have played Arkanoid, which is a similar type game, you will hear much better sound effects such as when your paddle goes from short to long.  This sound problem with this app would have not been as noticeable to me if the app would have included music, but since there is no music, the sound effects are loud and clear and seem somewhat dull.<br /><br />2.  The second problem is that there is no Save Game feature in this game.  There is a Restore Game option on the main screen, but it takes you back to the very first level so you have to start all over if you were like 13 levels in the game and quit the game for a moment.<br /><br />3.  Even though I played only around the first 13 levels so far, not one level requires you to hit the bricks twice to get rid of them.  You shouldn't be playing that many levels in this kind of game to get to that kind of brick in my opinion.<br /><br />So to sum it up, my opinion is that this is not a 5 star app but it probably depends on your expectations and I was apparently expecting more than the majority of reviewers.  So we are probably all right depending on your point of view!

B000002MHO|5.0|Many perceive \\"Erotica\\" as Madonna's worst album. It may have done unfavorably in sales, but I think that is just because Madonna was aiming at making her listeners blush. Striping off the blatant sexuality of our friend Dita, Madonna can be appreciated for what she does as an artist. No artist, in my opinion, can blend so many different styles of music, flawlessly on one album, and still have each song relate to one another. On a normal day I might cringe at the ideal of a lovely ballad sandwiched between two underground dance tracks, but somehow, Madonna pulls this off. She does take some risks though, the response track to \\"Waiting\\", \\"Did You Do It?\\" is 90's rap nonsense, and needs to be skipped. I realize it is artistic to not even be featured on a track on your own album, but I just don't enjoy it. Other than that one song, all of the 13 remaining are underrated hits that I truly believe are the work of a genius.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I this app and I recommend you get it put there's 3 things wrong with it, first, multiplayer doesn't work, second, the dynonite in the game doesn't explode and last, you cant change your character. this game rocks except for those reasons.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I wanted to start off saying that, as a whole, Born To Die is an album that definitely requires listening to get used to. Rather than being outwardly catchy, the songs slowly begin to imbue themselves into your mind. A standard pop song is like disappearing ink; it stains itself in your mind, darkly and quickly, and stays strong for a little bit, and then disappears from your memory completely. The songs in Born To Die are more like a stain that spreads across fabric. It doesn't make a big impact initially, but eventually creeps into a big permanent mark that sticks. Lana Del Rey's voice strikes me as tender, emotional, and real. If you hear artists (or do they even deserve that title?) like Katy Perry, Rihanna, and Britney Spears, their voices sound so aseptically clean and boring from the ravages of autotune. There are imperfections and differing inflections to Lana Del Rey's voice that personalize the music and make it feel like in each song she is revealing some kind of personal secret. Even though I did give Ms. Del Rey five stars, I would truly give Born to Die a score of 9 out of 10. The docked point isn't for any particular reason, but in comparison to albums like Madonna's Ray of Light, Joni Mitchell's Blue, and Carly Simon's Spy, it just doesn't measure up quite as well. But nonetheless, it is a new favorite album, and lyrically, it measures up as an equal to the albums I've listed. In all fairness, for an album, that takes some time to fully understand, I certainlly think this is a 2010's masterpiece.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A wonderful family movie.Great storyline!! Be sure to have tissues ready...A must see movie especially if you're a dog/animal lover...
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Matching tiles are beautifally animated and change as you progress though the game, shopping with game money to stock and decorate your aquaiums!  Yeah!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I received a used broken screen, which I changed out, Kindle Fire which came without a cable for charging. Purchased this Kindle Fire 5ft cable to go with Kindle PowerFast Accelerated Charging Unit. These work great together.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This app is Awesome! you start out with the first four element dragons and then you keep breeding different dragons together to get some common or if your lucky some rare dragons. I love this game. you can also plant crops to feed to your dragons to evolve them to a higher level. P.S. add me firebolt64 :)
B000S95KTY|4.0|I noticed just a few little scenes that were not part of the original. But what I liked the most was seeing the Veger ship complete without the the energy cloud around it. Glad I seen this version. If you like the original, you should check this out.
0307891372|5.0|This game sets a new level of design and story.  A landmark accomplishment.  Captivating and delivers a huge world of tasks and experience. I hope the many small glitches don't interfere with your enjoyment.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I do not believe it was well written, maybe a better editor was needed to knock out the redundant vocabulary, but I fell in love with the characters book one. I also like the story line and enjoyed how easy and quick it was to read.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|That was horrible! Why did I bother? At times, Rock of Ages seems to attempt to be serious, but falls short. Other times it seems akin to a \\"Scary Movie\\" type of flick, intentionally tongue-in-cheek, but overall, doesn't seem to be able to make up it's mind. I found myself checking the clock, and the time remaining all too often. I thought I would be treated to great renditions of songs I love, expecting something similar to \\"Across the Universe\\", and the songs were good, don't get me wrong. The plot however was pure garbage. In a nutshell, don't waste your time.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Oh where to begin?!?! This whole season was action packed between Stefen turning into a bad boy, things heating up between Damon and Elena, and trying to kill originals it was just awesome. And once you think things are calming down things go nuts again. And the finale...OMG I cannot wait till season four comes out on dvd.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I always enjoy the standard alien vs humanity byline & this is no exception. It would be tough to add much but they pull it off with ease and keep the watcher interested all thru.
B001NI24OI|2.0|This movie is no were near as good as the tv series. If you want real footbal drama watch all the tv series seasons.
B009SJ46EA|1.0|The show is awful. Couldn't figure out the plot, or jumped around to much. Last season was much better! I won't be watching the rest of season 2
B005DJGMQE|2.0|Not interesting, little content.  I thought this would have been much deeper in it's scope.  Production value was good but short on story.
0920668372|5.0|Had to have this book.  I had this book 20 years ago for my first grandchild  and had given it away.  Now 20 years later, I have a new grandchild.  Since my grandchild is a little girl, would have preferred the book refer to a little girl, but it is a good story.  A tear jerky for me.
B0061JPYX2|3.0|Wish I had read a review first so I wasn't expecting a brilliant follow up to her other CD\\"s.  Her voice is flawless and the music was great, I just hadn't realized there were so many cover songs. \\"Girl From Ipanema\\" I could have gone without hearing. But I'm sure for many it was a first time hearing old songs.  Just disappointed mainly because she's gone and I want to hear more.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I like the game but way do they have so many levels. the levels are so hard can he make them harder.
B00976MZYM|3.0|This Company Was A Little S**pid. This CD Has Curse Words All Through It!! In 'This Kiss' She Says 'Cause I Know Where Ya A** Is' And In 'More Than A Memory' She Says 'I Want To Shake That G*****N Machine' The Hit Track 'Sweetie' Says F*** A Million Times!!!! Don't Get This For Kids In U.K It Is Explcit Carly Rae Jepsen 'Kiss [Explcit Version]
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was a little apprehensive at first but as the story unfolded, the book consumed my imagination. In a week, I read all three books, I was extremely disappointed when I finished the third book and realised there was no more.<br /><br />It is a gripping story of love, trust and a few unexpected twists.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My wife downloaded this last night and wasn't expecting much, but found she couldn't put it down! She played over 200 of the puzzles and is excited for the challenge of the harder ones. At first it was a bit too easy, and she thought it might only be good for kids. But as she progressed to the harder levels she was pleased to find herself challenged. Great for a wide range of puzzle-solvers, but I got tired of it pretty quickly so I guess it's not everyone's cup of tea.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I was watching my friend play this game and I was looking at my kindle when I saw this game this is the 3rd time I completed this game and I bought all the gadgets and magnets
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is like temple run but funnier. when I first got this game I didn't think it would be that fun but it is!!!! I play it all the time!!!! Get this game it is so fun... I passes time like crazy:)
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The new book by Mitch Albom is thought provoking and will appeal to a wide spectrum of ages. The characters are all memorable, and makes one take a look at how time consumes us every day.  May we all learn a little something about love, loss, and living for today.
B008XG1X18|5.0|when using the full site on my kindle fire i couldnt post pins exactly where i wanted to but now with this app i have the choice where things are pinned. im very happy with this app so far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it! I loved how Suzanne Collins perfectly outlined each character in a way that makes you feel like you know them and your in the book with Katniss and Peata! Running through the woods away from the careers, climbing a tree, and feeling some of the emotions they are! Five stars any day!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a quick read for me.  Kept my attention and I couldn't put it down.  There are some heavy topics in the book (sex, drugs, abuse) but the author does a good job of giving it a \\"slice of life\\" feel.  I downloaded this book on my kindle after seeing the commercials for the movie (love Emma Watson!).  I have recommended this book to others - however, if you are like me and take on the emotions of the characters when you read, prepare to feel depressed/lonely when reading it.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie but it keeps being borrowed and not returned...this is my third copy which I have bought...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book. After reading the book, I re-watched the movie.  Reading the book helped me to understand the story on a deeper level.  I can see where the author got some of her inspiration from television reality shows.  Katniss is the ultimate survivor!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this series! I have read them all, and cannot wait for more. Loved that Hugh managed to change the typical and played out ideas about the post- apocalyptic world. Characters were catchy, and Hugh really keep the suspence high- I could not figure out where he was going or what was going to happen next. Very good!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Great show you almost forget it is a zombie show I want the governor dead and rip his body apart with the trucks he stole from our soldiers.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover has a nice hard exterior that protects the kindle well. Would highly recommend it. Bought this for my 10 yo nephew who liked it too!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie can't wait for the suitcase to come out in Spring of 2013. II never get tired of seeing neither do my kids.
0446580848|2.0|I have read every Nelson Demilled book ever published (some multiple times)and had awaited this one with great anticipation.  However, after reading well over half the book I came to realize that not only was the premise nonsense, he was relying on all the wisecrack comments ad nauseum.  Barely a paragraph goes by without some version of smart aleck aside and after over 600 pages of reading I was more than tired of them.  After the quality of his earlier books I find myself totally disappointed that this one has fallen so far from his original abilities.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest was too much bother at first. Then I found myself looking at it waiting for doctor's appointments. We used to look at magazines at times like that but there are none of those anymore as too many people took to stealing them. Then it struck me - and I looked at it more and more - that Pinterest is really the world's largest magazine, but it's designed and published by the readers. Seriously, it goes on forever, especially if you click through the pins and get into the web sites they came from. It became a very enjoyable, even calming activity. I like it. My only complaint is that the iPhone app crashes too often; but luckily it's easy to restart it. You just can't go back to the spot where it crashed, which should be fixed IMHO.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I originally saw the concert on PBS.<br />I was so impressed by the performances<br />and various artists I had to have the CD.<br /><br />The music is mostly familiar standards<br />with a mellow jazzy feel.<br /><br />I love it!
B00846REIS|1.0|I don't even know where to begin. I loved Fifty Shades which is notable for its intense plot & smooth transition from chapter to chapter (although I know many would disagree with me). Bared to You was a horrible rendition of a Fifty Wannabe. I cannot see the attraction to the creepy and annoying Gideon.  He was not at all sexy to me.  And Eva makes no sense herself.  Her roommate who she considers her best friend is a male whore who sleeps with both sexes and cheats on the nice ones.  The sex scene are all the same, boring, & repetitive with Gideon going down on her every single time. I suspect that Sylvia has a thing for that and she wrote it over and over to live vicariously through the character. I was sooo bored with this copy right infringed, cheap, not-even-romantic, unrealistic novel. If I could give it a negative score/star, I would!!  I REALLY tried to read it all, but I ended up having to skim through a lot of the parts because I couldn't bear reading their weird relationship.  I know there are people who rave at this book, but I honesty CANNOT understand why/how this could be rated more than 2 stars.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|if you need something to kill time that very addictive this game is great tor both. After two days on my phone I started over on my Kindle.
B004HD61KE|4.0|I always enjoy Rollins' books.  This was no exception.  Interesting premise about ancient cultures knowing so much more than we give them credit for - and knowing enough to keep it secret if destructive.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We wanted to have the videos on hand to re-watch them at our leisure. We were hooked immediately when our daughter shared the first program with us.
B008OOYALE|4.0|enjoy the creatures. but finding it hard to make the $ to progress. The dragons are very cute. Just started playing it. But it should get easier.
B008MEM24S|3.0|This app gets a little boring after you play the first 40 levels. If you have a child, he will like this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Absolutely crucial to everyday life, this makes reading the Bible so easy. Anytime, anywhere you have Scripture at your fingertips.A must have.
B009YDB2QK|4.0|She always has bad judgement when it comes to men. She couldn't see that Shane was bad for the group and now she doesn't she what governor is all about. What makes it worse is she is so stuck in her ways and beliefs. Still good episode.
B008NEMN0K|3.0|This is a pretty good movie, and I was excited to see it in 3D as I have been amazed by some other 3D blurays (Thor, Captain America, Avatar).<br /><br />Despite the fact that this wasn't \\"made for 3D\\", I was hopeful that the 3D reworking would yield some pretty cool results.  Unfortunately, I didn't really see much 3D that enhanced the film or made it really worth it to buy a new bluray since I had the dvd (and it isn't a \\"gotta have\\" film for me - I was interested in it for the 3D feature.<br /><br />If you don't have the film yet, it is a good addition to your collection.  If you love this movie and have the dvd, then sure buy it, but if you just like the film and have the dvd, and are looking to expand your 3D film collection for some cool 3D films, you might wanna spend your money on other 3D discs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game for minecraft ever it is just like the one for xbox in creative mod you get everything.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app gives you all the information you could need about your battery condition.  I really like the way it gives you the time you have left for each of the different functions of the phone.  I have not had a single glitch with it.  I highly recommend this product.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|It was a cute movie, laughed out lous several times.  I enjoy Natalie Portman.  It was nice to see a movie where the roles were reversed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! Definitely worth the wait. So excited for the third book out this spring! I didn't want it to end.
0316223239|4.0|I must say, I had to go with four stars because in the beginning, I found myself really struggling to get into this book. I just wanted to know what was going on and I feel it dragged a little and it was hard to put myself into a five year olds mind frame I think. Once I got to that point however, all of that changed. I was completely hooked! I read about half of the book just in one sitting.<br /><br />I won't do a synopsis because with the hundreds of other reviews I am sure you get the gist of what this book is about and the characters and such. I will just say that if you do purchase this book, you will not be disappointed!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this app my dad plays it and he is on level 168 it is a all family game. I was on level 39 almost on 40 and the app told me to redoundload it so I did and it sent me to level 1.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was a reminder of what we can really do with ourselves when we set out to do more than we think we can. She doesn't preach her lessons learned, but I hope everyone takes from this that to rise above our problems and our sorrows we have to rise above them. If you play with your problems, visit them regularly and tend them they will grow. Agustin Burroughs tells us to make a future bigger than our past when our past threatens to overwhelm us. She did so in a big way. A great read.
B002B0OVWA|5.0|A great album for any rock fan. Kasabian is a solid band from the UK, and play the states from time to time. They are a great live band, but produce some great studio work as well. This album has been around for awhile, but it is still one of my favorites.
0393343405|1.0|If possible, I suggest reading the summary of the book in two paragraphs. Then readers may continue with \\"On The Nature Of Things\\" by Lucretius.<br />Literal structure of this book leads to a dull, boring sum of sentences and letters. I wish the author did get some inspiration from Lucretius himself. If it was a fictional biography of Poggio the book hunter, it would be much more interesting to read. Book tells about the history of Rome, Epicuros, Alexandria for hundreds of pages. What if we already know about them? Do we really have to tell the story of Hypatia to explain \\"the Swerve\\"? Why authors treat people like dummies? For pages, I told to myself \\"come on man, come to the point\\"...
B0083JCCX8|5.0|Have now read this book a few times, and watched the movie on DVD, and still find that although I get lost in it for hours I am still finding little things I didn't notice before.<br /><br />It may be a book aimed at young adults but this young (43) adult, lifetime fan of fantasy, still loved it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|she loves the dragons. it's fun that some are clumpsy. the dragons are so cute &amp; she likes to change their names. probably my favorite team lava app yet.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Works just fine. Not much to it, plug in and use, but no problems with it at all. No lock-ups or freezes on any games. Purchased to replace a lost one.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I think this movie is just perfect in 3d specialy the depth is just great totally different thing from 2d I watched it on P50ST50 panasonic 3d tv with active 3d glasses
B006JPS1OM|5.0|The part that I like is when I have sex in the middle of the game;and I'm only 14.My name is Chloe Benjerman.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Arrived two days later than expected.  My family enjoyed the movie; great Blue-ray visuals and action; got the four disc version. I don't have 3D, so I am unable to watch this on any LED screen I have now.
B003BVK36Q|2.0|The style and psychological plot are typical Le Carre, but the action is way too slow, the characters too manichean and the end-product is ultimately dull. Definitely, not the best novel by this author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game!!! it's so quick that you think &quot;one more round&quot; &amp; have killed an hour before you know it! my new public transportation companion!
B007ME5BUG|4.0|Very interesting behind the scenes history of WWII.<br />Learning all kinds of new facts about causes and effects.<br />Many lessons for today to be found in this tome.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Just right! Not too hard or too easy - and a good story line as well!  Well worth the purchase price.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I'm a huge fan of dragons and this is the best game I have ever played. They're so cute as babies until they grow up as adults<br />.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved the title track.  After I purchased it and listened to all of the songs I loved every one.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Its a really awesome game I was iffy bout it at first but its actually a really kewl game. Its fun and addicting
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was interested in seeing how Rowling would write for adults.  She didn't.  Although the central plot involved adult community bickering, most of this novel centered on young adult issues.  The plot was predictable, and the characters lacked depth.  I would not recommend this book to friends.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Great movie! Although I would have liked a different ending. Visuals and performances were absolutely stunning. Kristen Stewart was great in the role.
B005MMYCY6|1.0|I only saw this movie because I was sick and depressed bythe Hurricane Sandy coverage on every news channel. By comparison to this movie, Hurricane Sandy made me upbeat! The so-called writer/director must have been one helluva talker to get a $7 million(?!!!)budget for this P.O.S.!! How many decent and fine scripts were passed over for this POS? Small hospitals could have been built with $7 million, even landfills which is where this POS deserves to be buried, oh, so deep! If I could, I'd buy the rights to this POS and destroy every copy.<br /><br />This has to be a record-breaker for the \\"F\\" word and hearing it out of the mouths of kids is so not funny. Art (if this is what you want to call it) is a reflection of the artist, what they love, what turns them on,how they view the world. By seeing this piece of crap I can see the writer/director is obsessed with drugs/)truly disgusting porn/vandalism/theft, et al. and desperately needs to grow up and pull his head out of the sewer. The Hesher character is merely a large INFANT with a driver's license and no boundaries smashing through the world in one ugly tantrum after another. So sick of these movies! The world is burning. We need uplifting fare, not crap. And WHAT is Hollywood Princess Portman doing in this thing? Did she need the money this bad?<br /><br />DO NOT LET CHILDREN SEE THIS!!!<br /><br />You've been warned....again.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is one of the first gamesi downloaded onto my k. fire and its been on it ever since. its a great game keeps your attention from day one. I would suggest it for anyone.

B00433TO52|1.0|There is no table of contents.  Best you get are categories \\"Comedy's\\", \\"Tragedies\\", etc.  From there you have to flip page by page to the play you want to read hoping that you one day find it.  Also a great many general errors as well with spacing.  Something that happens frequently is this:<br /><br />SPEAKER 1: Blah blah blah.<br />SPEAKER 2: Blah blah!SPEAKER 1: Blah!<br /><br />Very glad I only paid $2 for this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is most likely the best app ever because it is simple and I think that it can be very difficult.  the only thing I have against it is that it needs wifi
B0057ZAA0S|5.0|Trainspotting is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. It's funny, sad, tragic, horrific and cautionary too without being preachy of the dangers of heroin. Highly re-watchable considering some of the most shocking and at times potentially repellant scenes to ever appear in a mainstream film. It still is director Danny Boyle's best film to date.<br /><br />Regarding Lionsgate's blu-ray of Trainspotting, there has been a bit of controversy. There had been a few years back a 2 disc collector's edition of the film which presented it in its international cut that differed very slightly from the American R rated cut. To avoid an NC-17 rating, a couple of seconds were trimmed from the sex scene involving Ewan McGregor's character and a girl he meets at a club. The filmmakers also had to substitute a few shots amounting to only about 3 or so seconds in this same sex scene and also substitute a later shot of a needle breaking Ewan's arm during his overdose scene with a shot of his face instead. To be honest, the slight changes in the American R rated cut are imperceptible unless you've seen the uncut version and even then, it's really not a big deal at all.<br /><br />For the film's American blu-ray release though, Lionsgate used the R rated version instead of the uncut international version. While I was ever so slightly disappointed in that fact, the positives of this hi-def release greatly outweigh this particular fact. Colors are greatly improved along with much better contrast and detail compared to the DVD. In fact, the blu-ray makes the DVD look positively washed out in comparison. There is a nice filmic layer of grain throughout and I couldn't spot any instances of any digital noise reduction. This blu-ray simply blows the older DVD out of the water and is truly like seeing the film all over again for the first time. Audio is presented in lossles 5.1 DTS sound.<br /><br />All of the extras from the 2 disc DVD collector's edition were carried over. If you own the prior DVD and are a completist like myself, I just threw away the pointless digital copy and instead kept the first disc of the 2-disc DVD to still have the uncut intertional version. There is a 2 disc blu-ray release in Europe that contains the uncut version but it is region B locked so unless you have a region free blu-ray player, the Lionsgate blu-ray is the best way to go.<br /><br />While I'm not sure why Lionsgate put the R rated cut on the blu-ray, that is the only thing that slightly keeps this release from being definitive. But it really is a very minor differance. Like I mentioned earlier though, the picture quality is a quantum leap over the DVD and is still well worth the upgrade. Highly recommended!the prior DVD and are a completist like myself, I just threw away the pointless digital copy and instead kept the first disc of the 2-disc DVD to still have the uncut intertional version.

B008J34466|5.0|I really liked this album!  I listened to most of it first on Spotify because they were showcasing it.  I sort of understood why, I felt sorry for Pink.  I didst know HER story the way I know Britney's or either Jessica or Ashley Simpson (and don't mention Lindsey Lohan! I think that girl may single evenhandedly made first name GO OUT OF STYLE for a generation or so)! But perhaps because of I didn't know why she dropped out of sight in scandal or to have a baby or rehab...<br /><br />I wasn't too sick of tabloid coverage was the byproduct of Skill on her talent.  Then when I listened to the album, for the first time since maybe the very first Album...SHE REMINDED ME WHY I TOOK NOTICE OF WHAT MADE ME LOVE AND HAVE TO TO LISTEN TO PINK WHEN SHE WAS BRAND NEW ON THE SCENE MAYBE WHAT IN 2000 or maybe 2001.  And I knew I ad to have this this entire album as soon as I heard it!  I felt she was BACK WITH ALL HER ATTITUDE, plus some witty songs!  What is not to love about that.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|The new installment of the \\"Bourne\\" franchise stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, an \\"Operation Outcome\\" agent, and Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing responsible for his medical check-ups. The filmmakers of \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" should thank their luck that they were able to have these gifted players, for without them, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" would have been a total mess.<br /><br />The storyline of \\"Legacy\\" itself is not complicated. Now that some of the CIA's top secrets are publicly exposed, Edward Norton's character Eric Byer is hired to erase all the evidences that would lead to further investigation. \\"The Bourne legacy\\" is not about Jason Bourne, but a chain of events that was triggered by his action seen in \\"Ultimatum.\\"<br /><br />However, despite several fine action sequences, \\"Legacy\\" tends to be tedious, taking so much time trying to explain everything. Locations are interesting, and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are both impressive, but the film lacks suspense, suffering from the heavy-handed narrative. Also, the character of Aaron Cross is not very interesting, lacking the complexity that Jason Bourne is allowed to have.<br /><br />To make a new Bourne film means to give a new story and characters to the audiences who have enjoyed the Jason Bourne story arc. Tony Gilroy (screenwriter of the three previous Bourne films) is in charge of this difficult job of expanding the trilogy's universe. To do so, he not only employed ideas like brainwashing and chemicals; the new director called back some of the franchise's supporting players including Joan Allen, Albert Finney and Scott Glenn. Neither of them works. The scientific elements are pretentious and clichéd while, as to the presence of these veteran actors, they only help remind us of the merits of \\"Ultimatum,\\" which knew how to entertain the viewers.<br /><br />After all, what is the point of making another \\"Bourne\\" movie when Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is not coming back? In spite of the electrifying acting from Jeremy Renner, \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" will not answer that question. Perhaps things would have been better with someone as director, who remembers the Bourne trilogy was first and foremost made for entertainment. As it is, \\"Legacy\\" remains a so-so action movie with A-list actors.

0446580848|1.0|I have read most of DeMille's works and enjoyed them. The first John Corey novel was okay - the wisecracking was kept to a minimum and the action moved along. The Lion was worse and The Panther is just a dud. DeMille is more interested in delivering what he (erroneously) believes are clever quips rather than a compelling read. Corey has become the kind of tiresome character you don't want to sit next to at dinner or on a plane. Paid my money for the Kindle version but couldn't be bothered to finish. Sayanora, John Corey.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Great game, needs more space in habitats to accomodate so many dragons. Love the poison dragon, however some dragons could be more attractive, after all dragons are meant to be cute.
B0016GOM5Q|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE. A GREAT WESTERN. WYATT EARP and DOC HOLLIDAY and the SHOOT OUT at the legendary OK CORRAL. Cast also includes KURT RUSSELL (WYATT EARP), SAM ELLIOT, BILL PAXTON, DANA DELANEY (beautiful), and JASON PRIESTLY (excellent in this role). ALL performances are stellar, but are shadowed by the BRLLIANCE of VAL KILMER. The bad guys in this movie are REALLY bad guys. ONE of my FAVORITES. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 5 stars are not enough.
0525952926|2.0|Ken Follett's second book of the Century Trilogy, \\"Winter of the World\\" disappointed me in several different ways. The first is financial. The electronic Kindle edition goes for $19.99 as of this writing. Let's call it a cool 20 bucks. That is highway robbery, double the cost of the first book, \\"Fall of Giants.\\" There are other problems with cost/publisher that I wanted to include with this critique. Penguin is the parent publisher of this book and the company ran afoul early-on with the federal government (US) over its pricing practices. I recently learned that Penguin terminated its relationship with Overdrive, which almost all public libraries use to make e-books (including Kindle) available to library patrons. This means that \\"Winter of the World\\" and all other Penguin titles are not available to those of us that use public libraries.<br /><br />As for the book itself, $20 is an awful lot of money to pay out in return for the reading experience. I am 62 years old, too young to have served in World War II, but plenty young enough to know WWII veterans. When I was old enough to take an interest, these vets were either in their late 30s or mid 40s. Of all the human conflicts that I have read about and/or talked to participants about, World War II is one of the very few conflicts in world history where mankind had a clear choice to make: good vs. evil.<br /><br />For the most part, World War II serves as a patchy tapestry for the characters in \\"Winter of the World.\\" So much was glossed over. While the Jewish Holocaust is mentioned in the book, the concentration camps get no play at all. The Battle of Britain (known as \\"The Blitz\\") in the book has gone down in history as \\"Britain's Finest Hour.\\" Yet, except for a brief plot line where Daisy drives an ambulance in the Blitz, very little is said about it.<br /><br />One of the most incongruent and contrived scenes in the book takes place in Pearl Harbor. Senator Gus Dewar and his family are invited to breakfast aboardthe \\"USS Arizona.\\" So they are traveling across the harbor to battleship row and the \\"Arizona\\" when, you guessed it, the Japanese Zeroes arrive. An errant bullet from a Zero kills Woody's fiancé. This twist in the plotline was improbable and incongruent addition. First, to get to Hawaii, the family had to fly there. In 1941, flights from the US mainland to Hawaii were extremely rare. Then, they just happen to be on the launch when the Japanese strike. The death of Woody's fiancé makes no sense in the context of the book. We leave Woody as he is cradling his fiancé, and he doesn't show up again in the book until at least a hundred pages later. His fiancé gets one more passing mention, but Woody, by the time we hear from him again is on to \\"bigger and better things,\\" as they say.<br /><br />The first book, \\"Fall of Giants,\\" had interesting characters and the tapestry of World War I shines. Follett does a good job explaining the world's obsession with \\"class,\\" especially that of Britain, Russia, and to a lesser extent, Germany. The characters are well fleshed out. Follett's narrative into the causes of World War I make for an absorbing history lesson. For the most part, the author basically throws the characters from the first book into the dustbin for \\"Winter of the World.\\" He uses the offspring from the characters in \\"Fall of Giants\\" to take up the load in the sequel. I felt \\"robbed\\" in that his \\"old\\" characters got so little play. For example, Billy and Fitz were in their prime of life when the second book started. They were just old enough to be able to assume the mantle of responsibility and political strength, but they weren't around.<br /><br />The only thing that I can say as I conclude this is that I hope the third book is better and that I hope the pricing is a lot fairer.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I find Dr. Alexander to be I gifted writer and capable historian. His story is fascinating and compelling.  However, I trust  I am not  alone  in my frustration that he appears to have intentionally failed to flesh out  the details of his experience in heaven.  For example, he writes of having all of his questions answered, yet fails to elaborate on what these questions were, and what the answers were. Yes, like any Christian, I am troubled by the apparent absence of Christ from Dr. Alexander's story.  Yet, I just have a feeling that Dr. Alexander has much more to say, but has unfortunately chosen not to do so.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but boring and it needs to be more creative I also hats that they send me messages every day
0140025146|5.0|I bought the book years ago.  At some point it didn't come home to me and I missed it so I tried to find a replacement copy.  I did and I am glad. Thank you.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm sorry. To all the obviously sex starved married women (I am single), this book was STUPID. If the main character said, \\"Holy Hell, Holy Sh&*%!, Holy Crap\\", etc, one more time, I thought I would throw the book across the room. The author loved to use big fancy words throughout the entire book, as if that might impress the more intelligent readers into continuing with the torture of reading this book. Couldn't wait to finish it. But, could the author be more obvious in trying to get everyone rushing out to buy part 2, by ending it the way she did?! Yuk! Not me!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was skeptical on this game.  Had heard too much about it and thought it couldn't be that much fun.  I was wrong!  It is great!  I am hooked!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|To truly appreciate the scope, depth, and brilliance of this book, you must give it the time it deserves. Rich characters and memorable places must be drawn and drawn well.  This author knows how to create, so trust him and enjoy a splendid read!

B00A11AN6O|5.0|This app is a great turnkey solution to keep a cloud copy of your photos from your phone.  Face it, you never know when your phone might be lost and if you're like me you take a lot more pictures with your phone than the bulky DSLR.  Losing my phone would cause me to lose a lot of memories.  Not any more with this app!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun game! very addictive. although it takes a little bit of time to earn more coins ....that helps me to be more strategic in using the coins I have.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I was disappointed in the detail of the movie.  I think the cornicopia and the features of the game field could have been much better

B005EGXTL2|2.0|Annoying, repetitive, and ultimately as disappointing as the matrix trilogy, which I think holds the record for great first, average second and awful third.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|I really liked Battlefield L.A. and thought that this might be something akin to that only taking place on water. Well I was wrong. The movie has a lot of glaring questions not answered. Why is the US Navy involved with other countries Navy's in military exercises? It tries to lay some well worn subplot about the Older, can do not wrong brother trying encourage his younger brother to take more responsibility and seriousness his role in the Navy with a kinda Rah Rah feel to it.<br />When the Aliens appeared on the Radar I thought, great, now the screaming starts. Well for reasons unknown the Aliens reason for coming to earth is not at all defined. We know that one ship lands on an Island of the Hawaiian kind to set up satellites to call in other ships, or so the characters assume, but they really seem like prospectors. Their ships are big, but they lack for any real apocalyptic armaments other then then outside canons and these rollers with spikes which would seem to indicate that they are in the mining business. And these wheels are like their digging machines. Their ship really seem made for cargo transport then battle.<br /><br />Their technology differentiates between friend, schooner or yacht and possible foe battleship and they never fire on civilians only the obviously armed Battleships.  I think we fired first, but the plot hole is why they did not try any attempt at communication as to their intentions which may have only meant mining, perhaps for some materials that their technology could reach and maybe it was more of a supply gathering splashdown. Maybe they needed alloys for repair. Anything. But all we do is open fire. Back and forth and a bunch of silly dialogue in-between. Was Liam Neeson hard up for a check? Cause he barely had anything close to 20 minutes screen time. The plot if thats what it was, was all over the place and droned on till you really stopped careing by the middle of the film.  A real stinker of a Alien movie. That I stand by.
1477419497|2.0|I found this book to be slow at times, and there were not many characters in it that I liked. Come to think of it, I didn't care about a single one of them. Moreover, all the French characters were reduced to ridiculous clich&eacute;s and insipid dialogue(I know several French people and not one of them refers to themselves in the third person). If you have any grasp of French at all, it will drive you crazy that even the French characters do not speak their own language well. The plot itself was about what you would expect of a mystery of this genre: it is not heavy reading, and I was looking for something of a \\"beach read\\". In the end, it is rather a silly story, but I could have overlooked that if it wasn't so irritating in so many ways. Obviously, no one edited this book because it is full of errors and inconsistencies, but if none of the above bother you, then read away. As for me, I will be avoiding any future books by this writer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|When I downloaded this I was expecting the same old solitaire that comes free on many windows computers, but it has more features including multiplayer that definitely outshine that other version.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We received this DVD super fast.  The movie is excellent.  It is a very family-friendly movie.  We are glad we purchased it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The stories never end. This is yet another page Turner that you just don't want to put down. Great story.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Though its not as great a read as some of his other books, this will still put a hold on your spirit with a call to something greater.
B009GEOLM4|4.0|Great transition to animation from the Dark Night Returns graphic novel, the stylistic integrity is maintained, the scaling between characters (Batman is HUGE) and it really just felt like it came to life.<br /><br />I took a star off because it seems like some of the more risque ideals were/are not being addressed, perhaps this is all being saved for Part 2?  Fantastic nevertheless.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i couldnt get a tv or stuff but still epic<br />i wish i could get a tornado that would be epic!!!!!!!!!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|watched it with the whole family. good plot, good quality picture, and the music was enjoyable too :) i would recommend this movie for a family blockbuster night :)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Believable characters, strong story line, and a great interweaving of real science. Weir does a wonderful job of detailing hard science without sacrificing dramatic tension. By structuring the bulk of the book as the protagonist's log, the author provides the intimacy of a first person viewpoint while maintaing a taut narrative--the character, by necessity, must spend long periods of time thinking and working, and the mechanism of the log enables the author to shorten those time periods while keeping the reader engaged.<br /><br />The first thing I did upon finishing the book was to see if Weir had written anything else, but apparently not. If this is, in fact, his first novel, I'm doubly impressed and I eagerly await his next one.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I bought this cd on chance, hoping that she has grown with her lyrical writing. And, to be honest she has. I never really considered her country. I always thought it was pre-teen pop. Most of her music always seemed like something 5th graders would be screaming for. But with \\"Red\\" she has truly transformed herself into a very talented pop songwriter. I'm sure there will be the Taylor haters for the change in sound and style, but guys she has to grow up. Thank God she did on this album.....
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Why one star? Because this book uses sex to explore  a relationship.  However it so over uses this comparison that it became boring.  I think it displays huge tracts of chauvenism: not just within the story, but from the author.  Such bias invades the book and renders the whole down to a level of  that which reminds me of kids books- say The Famous Five.  Do I bother with the sequels?  I doubt it.  Even as a source of sexual information it is pretty silly and appears to try to say that there is 100% satisfaction between partners 99% of the time.  Reality check- this is not true.  So one star only.  I am only sad that I paid for it and was fooled by all the unwarranted hype
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game makes time go by quicker when spending all day at the Veterans Hospital. you will love the spider also there are other games just as good.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|And that disclaimer would be \\"If you are not a neurosurgeon this book is probably not for you\\". I kept waiting for some kind of cohesive experience and it's mostly about his youth and being abandoned. There were about 4 or 5 pages about his NDE and the rest was about how the brain works. Sorry this was a waste of time for me. If you want to read an amazing story about a near death experience read: 90 minutes in Heaven by Don Piper.

B007V65R54|5.0|An excellent thought provoking book with a perspective for change. The section on poker should help gamblers stay home and off the internet.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This game was the Free app of the day yesterday, and I got it.  I had to wait until the day after to play it.  When I saw the title, it looked low quality, and it appeared to have only 5 levels.  I started playing and it looked much better.<br />Difficulty: 2/5<br />This game is pretty easy, for the most part.  I got to level 25 on my first run.<br />Graphics: 4/5. They looked really good, but could use some touching up.<br />Sound: 3/5.  Couldn't hear too much, but when I heard it, it sounded good at best.<br />Gameplay: 5/5.  This game is downright addicting, and it's really fun.  My only question is why powerups fall normally with the timer on.<br />I recommend this app for casual gamers who just want to have fun.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|If you are looking for a good dungeon adventure game this is it. Not a role player so much as a real Hack and Slash, that is all you will need to do. There is a rage and block skill too.<br />  As for leveling up and getting better stuff. Auto level will increase your life and rage bars. Weapons and armor can be bought or made better with stuff found in the dungeons. The better and best stuff is from using real money. going to the online store to get Glu coin and silver.<br /> If your looking for a chalange with out the use on premium items and dungeon crawlers is what you want, this game is for you.
B008G12ERC|5.0|So...if you're a Muser like me then all you need to know is that this is Muse. There. That's all you need to know so it's an invisible guarantee that the album is amazing. If you are starting off listening to Muse then you should take into consideration that this is a band that takes and sings about current world events which are conscious and not simple subjects. If you are a deeper thinker and don't really admire music with the words \\"club\\" \\"swagger\\" \\"drunk\\" \\"girlfriend\\" etc...then this is the music for you. Extremely versatile yet everything is connected by an underlying theme. Again Muse have done an AMAZING job making an AMAZING album for our enjoyment. Thank you Muse!

0307454894|2.0|I found the book offerd a unique glimpse of some areas of the Holocaust, but the characters within the story come across as detached and with no emotional depth.  Both Hanna and Michael seem like cardboard cutouts, and just totally disconnected.  I think because of this, I was never invested in either of them and the anticipated 'love story' of the first chapter falls totally flat.  Also the callous unemotional way Hanna behaves towards her young lover lets you know she is clearly broken, and a tregedy is yet to come.  Her sudden departure was almost a given, as to me they never bonded in any real way.  I also realised Hanna was probably illiterate from the start, so the big revealing 'secret' was a non-event.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|On my Kindle Fire when i scroll halfway down in my newsfeed, i get nothing but blue boxes wit the person post. i see no pic, no nothing where i can like and/or comment on the post or anything.

078322933X|3.0|\\"Fear\\" is a callow and mean-spirited movie that plays on the worst fears and paranoia of rich white men who have a blonde teenage daughter.  In all likelihood and reality, their blonde teenage daughter is attending a secluded private school in which anorexia, drug abuse, and promiscuous sex are manifestations of privilege and power.  In other words, the real danger to the purity and sanctity of their beloved girl is the world they have sheltered them in.  However, this idea would be much too profound for any movie starring Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon, and so all that we're left are the collective fears of rich white men.<br /><br />I list them below:<br /><br />1.)  Their pure and beautiful daughter has a slutty and out-of-control best friend who thinks that smoking, dating older homicidal men, and attending drug-infested rave parties is a good way a Wednesday night.<br />2.)  Their pure and beautiful daughter meets a dark and handsome stranger at a party, and is immediately drawn into his grip and power.<br />3.)  This dark and handsome stranger is poor.  But much worse he's grammatically-challenged, and so these rich white men who've obviously all been educated at Hotchkiss and at Yale have absolutely no idea what he's saying.<br />4.)  Their pure and beautiful daughter loses her virginity to this dark and handsome stranger with grammar issues.<br />5.)  Their trophy wife starts liking this dark and handsome stranger.<br />6.)  This dark and handsome stranger is a violent psychopath who wants to break into their house, and rape their daughter and wife.  (Actually, he's much worse:  He's Mark Wahlberg, and he thinks he can sing and act.)

B005LAIHYU|2.0|The book was excellent; the movie was so far from the book that it isn't even worth comparing the two. The fact that the screenplay was written by the author of the book that the movie is &#34;based&#34; off of makes it even worse. If you read the book and are looking to see the movie because you liked the book, then don't watch it. If you haven't read the book and are looking for an action movie with a weird premise, then you may find it hard to keep up with the plot, but does that really matter in an action movie?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All that I can say is that this is a great book. I can't wait to read the next one. I am almost done with this one.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|its a another marvel release and they do there thing bringing so many leading actors in a such well told story action non stop and commedy which that make make this film that greater i think all i can say i loved it
0062127241|4.0|Just some random thoughts on \\"Who I Am\\" from a 55-year-old lifelong fan of Pete and The Who:<br /><br />1. Was impressed by how much Pete's art-school education influenced the early Who music, style, and performances and by Pete's creative struggle to reconcile this education with his night job in the early days of the Who. The early chapters in the book are well worth the read.<br /><br />2. It's unbelievable just how much the guy accomplished by the age of 30 or so. Look at Tommy alone. The guy really is a musical genius. Throw in Who's Next and Quadrophenia, and it is just a massive amount of creativity and music. All that has truly stood the test of time.<br /><br />3. Pete writes in a brutally honest manner. In many, many passages in the book, especially in dealings with his wife and family, Pete comes off as not very likeable. And he realizes and freely admits to his bad judgement and bad behavior, calling himself a total ass many times.<br /><br />4. The book can be a little rambling at times. It seems to gloss over some potentially interesting aspects of Pete's life and music, while dwelling on some other topics that become redundant.<br /><br />5. However, I am grateful for what Pete has chosen to share (the good and the bad). The guy doesn't owe me anything. He's given me a lifetime of music and creativity already.

B000G6R7B8|4.0|Great watch if you are looking for an outdoors watch or if you are working in an environment where you need a robust watch. Built to the usual shape of a military watch, the seconds hand sweeps and is painted red. The hour and minute hands are both luminous and there are luminous indicators for each hour. The lume is great and when exposed to a small amount of light is very bright and can be seen very clearly. The back has a display case that is a nice touch. The strap is a canvas style and is reasonably robust especially considering I have read a few other reviews of canvas straps that have been of poor quality. The day and date function are also good. The face is beige in colour as is the strap. All in all a very good watch.<br /><br />So now to cover the major points of the watch.<br /><br />Firstly the power reserve. I have found that it can be erratic at times. I have left this watch at times at home overnight and during the day while wearing another watch and returned to find it keeping excellent time (About 18 hours later) However on other occasions on my travels I have left it on a cabinet and found it to be failing after only a few hours, in fairness this has only happened once or twice. When the watch is worn constantly it keeps excellent time.  The main reason for this is unlike most automatics the Seiko 5 watches cannot be handwound, you \\"Charge\\" Them by shaking them (Which may worry some people) To get them going, they need to be in constant use on the wrist if they do the power reserve will last the night otherwise, you may find it to be erratic.<br /><br />Secondly the lume. If going from good light to poor light (i.e. from daylight to dusk) It can struggle to pick up enough light to be effective. When in total darkness however the lume is fantastic. I have checked the time after 5 or more hours and found it to be still bright enough to see the watch at a good arms length so no holding the watch almost to your nose to read the time. From daylight to poor artificial light however, its very good.<br /><br />The strap. Its a canvas strap which can have its problems, namely the ends can get frayed very easily and I find they can sometimes start to rub on the wrist when they begin to age.  This is holding out OK I usually use a nato strap with military watches (And divers for that matter) However with this it would cover the display back so its a bit of a waste.  I would stick with the canvas strap.<br /><br />After using this in a few tough conditions I still strongly recommend it. The watch still looks good, glass is tip top and very robust. People say that the crystal Seiko use are prone to scratching.  Well I honestly dont know what conditions they are using a watch under but this has been trekking, on holiday abroad etc and not a mark on it.  Never had a problem with the crystal on a Seiko watch. Lume is fantastic at night and in constant wear keeps excellent time.oor artificial light however, its very good.<br /><br />The strap.

B0024FADAQ|5.0|I saw this movie back in the 1980's when it first came put.  Very good movie.  I recommend purchasing it. It brings back some memories.
B009LUBA7M|3.0|So. Much. Autotune.<br /><br />This album is just ... overproduced to the point where it gets in the way. On the first pass, I was reminded of downloading MP3s from napster back in the day, when you'd get that rogue song that sounded vaguely electronic and distorted because the bit-rate was way too low. Though I'd say more of the songs on this album are good than not, none of them are made better by him sounding half-man-half-robot. He has a genuinely good voice and doesn't even need the audio magic. I wish I had bought the deluxe edition because it has a bunch of acoustic versions on it and I imagine those are probably better than the originals.<br /><br />Love You When I'm Drunk is the one I think has the most potential to be a mainstream hit in the US. Popular Song surprised me the most - I was so sure it'd be another blatantly-pandering-to-the-fanbase song (a la 'Big Girl'), plus sampling a showtune? No way that could be good. But, there's a beautiful kind of raw spitefulness to it that I found surprisingly authentic. And that's when I think Mika is at his best. Despite my comments about the autotune, underneath it all, at least there's still a lot of complex and authentic emotion
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I purchased this for a friend who was very happy.  She wanted to complete her collection of Transformers and I suggested getting this package, I think it was cheaper in the long run to purchase the collection this way.
0316228532|1.0|This was lousy. Finished it just to see if there was redemption somewhere. Heard that on NPR the author said it was semi autobiographical.. Guess that means that she is getting revenge - sort of?- on the muggles who looked down on her as she struggled prior to becoming the uber successful international best seller.  This is a sophomoric shallow depressing negative book.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Awesome album! I bought it for a few songs and now, I haven't found one song I don't love. So glad I got the whole thing and not just songs.
0062127241|4.0|I am nearing the end of this book and have enjoyed it as I am a big Who fan. Townshend has led an interesting life and shares the good and the bad with us, even if it is uncomfortable for him...and us. I do think this is part of his healing process...he frequently admits his mental instability. Good for him.<br /><br />That being said, this book needed an editor who is not a Who fan/friend. And then it needed to be given to some Who fans who could have given some feedback prior to publication. For an editor, Townshend should have seen how chopped up the text is...it is like a bad splicing of your Dad's old Super 8 movies....<br /><br />There is the usual sex, drugs and rock and roll entries...I wish there was more on the creative process...more on what London was like in the 1960s...more guitar talk...less chatting about his non-musical interests. He spends far too much time on his post-Who concept albums which were TERRIBLE in my opinion. He has become far too intellectual/artsy fartsy for my tastes...but after giving us so much material for so many years, I forgive him. As he clearly tells us, it was either continue with The Who and die or leave them and live...exploring whatever interested him. I'd rather have Pete alive and well. Fame and fortune are not what they are cracked up to be and he sounds like he has arrived at a good place, complete with a new wife. Yeah!<br /><br />I've seen Pete solo and with the Who a couple of times since 1982. He is a tempestuous genious who would be very difficult to work with/for...but often times, great people are that way.<br /><br />Read the book. Enjoy it but realize it is trying to be all things to all people and comes decades after the events (which are sanitized for the general reading public).<br /><br />It also has made me pull out all my old Who(and good solo)cds and enjoy them anew.<br /><br />PS: Finished the book last night and wanted to add one more thing. I thought I knew PT until I read this passage at the end:\\"I am proud that what I do provides jobs, and although I am wealthy and privileged, in my heart and my actions I am still a socialist and activist, ready to stand by for the underdog and the beaten down...\\" The Who--and PT himself--have so far avoided politics in their music. I applaud all efforts to help others (but do think it can get in the way of the art,,,as in U2 who have devolved into an Irish branch of Team Obama).<br /><br />But here we go again with another rich celebrity with a \\"socialist\\" agenda. Unlike that dope George Clooney and his friends in Hollywood, at least PT has not tried to tell me what to do or think. Or that he is better than the rest of us because he cares more. I wish more liberal 1%ers here in the USA were like PT and do their work without preaching their moral superiority to the rest of us. As Pete said many years ago, \\"Just do your job and shut up.\\"

0811875040|2.0|Yes, the double chocolate cake is awesome awesome awesome, and I guess having that recipe justifies this waste of money, but the rest of the recipes are pretty foul.  Most of the cakes call for 7+ egg yolks.  I just think that's nasty.  Heart disease just waiting to happen.  Other stuff like the lemon curd taste eggy too.  Blegh, whatever - it's cute and all, but I still feel sad to have wasted my money.

0316228532|5.0|It has been a pleasure to read this book. While certainly a different work than the Harry Potter series, Rowling's cast of characters is often reminiscent of Agatha Christie...albeit much more adult and less racist.  I began to read this with hesitation, but was soon lost in it's pages.  Worth a read, but don't expect anything like she has written before.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise kingdom is about exactly what you think it would be.  Awesome.  Funny, dramatic, and a little romance thrown in for good measure.  Also an added bonus - Bill Murray.  Movie tip #1 if you want you movie to succeed, add Bill Murray.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|This was a ripping read...had to grudgingly put it down to do other things (like go to work).  The author keeps the book moving at a good pace.  It didn't get bogged down in the process of becoming a SEAL (this was interesting anyway) and the OBL section was the highlight.  Can't say much more than that...highly recommended.
0802473156|5.0|A friend told me about this book when I was complaining about my son and his decision to end an engagement with the girl of our dreams. I have been so wrong. After reading this book, of which I ordered and received five copies, I knew I was wrong. I immediately called him to apologize. I did not go into detail, but did send him and her each a copy of this book. I also sent a copy to my daughter and her husband of two years. They are in that rough patch when the honeymoon is over. I pray they will read it and work it out before making a decision to end the relationship. It is so easy these days to just walk away. They did take the test online and found out their Love Language. That is a start. Thank you for writing such a clear presentation of how we can all live and love together. Even after many years of marriage, my husband and I read it. It has put into us a new kind of thinking. We are a lot closer. Thanks again, Keep writing. Ty
1572815108|5.0|As a tarot collector, the Thoth Tarot has been one that always intrigued me.  Designed by Aleister Crowley and Painted by Lady Frieda Harris, this one is probably the third most popular deck after the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot and Tarot of Marseilles.  With an intriguing collage of symbols, this is a deck that caters to the occult like no other.<br /><br />The Thoth Tarot from US Games comes in two sizes:<br />- 4.375\\" x 2.75\\" deck which is 0.375\\" smaller than standard US Games decks.<br />- 5.5\\" x 3.75\\" deck which is ~1\\" bigger and wider than standard US Games decks.<br /><br />The smaller deck is easier to handle and includes two additional versions of the Magus, while the images are easier to see on the larger one.  However, the larger deck lacks the additional cards.<br /><br />The back of these cards is non-reversible, showing a Rosicrucian cross, colored yellow up, white and black down, red left and blue right on top of a green spark, on a crisscrossing diamond pattern containing small symbols of wands, cups, swords, and disks.<br /><br />The Major Arcana are numbered at the top, in roman numerals starting at 0 with The Fool.  Comparing these to the RWS Tarot, I noticed that the following:<br /><br />I. The Magician - I. The Magus<br />VIII. Strength - XI. Lust<br />X. The Wheel of Fortune - X. Fortune<br />XI. Justice - VIII. Adjustment<br />XIV. Temperance - XIV. Art<br />XX. Judgement - XX. The Aeon<br />XXI. The World - XXI. The Universe<br /><br />These cards are labeled at the bottom, with an Hebrew character and an elemental, planetary, or astrological symbol included with the label.<br /><br />The Minor Arcana are arranged in four suits: wands, cups, swords and discs.  These corresponds to the elements of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth.<br /><br />The pips are numbered at the top.  The Aces of each suit are labeled as such at the bottom while pips 2 to 10 are labeled with a key word.  These cards are illustrated, but focus only on the symbols of each suit, and are devoid of any figure, human or otherwise.  These include small symbols corresponding to the planet and astrological sing associated with them.<br /><br />The court cards are only labeled at the bottom as Princess, Prince, Queen and Knight of each suit.  These are associated to elements of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, correspondingly.<br /><br />The deck comes in a fitting box with a little white book (LWB).  In the LWB, The cards a numbered starting on 1 (The Fool) and concluding with 78.  The Ace of Wands is numbered 23, The Ace of Cups is numbered 37, The Ace of Swords is numbered 51, and The Ace of Discs is numbered 65.<br /><br />A lot of books have been written exploring the richness of symbols in this deck, so I'm not going to pretend to scratch the surface in this review.  Suffice to say that this is one belongs in the collection of any avid tarot collectors.and are devoid of any figure, human or otherwise.

B008PNBU30|5.0|ONLY gripe I have is that they didn't send me the album in the classic plastic casing but then again I don't think they do that for any albums nowadays. This CD though is probably one of the better CDs you can own and 10 more years from now its gonna be a classic and join the family with other great old records. Many of these songs will catch on and make you drop what your doing to really pay attention to em, on the first listen. While there are some that may take a couple more listens to really appreciate, songs like \\"Chalk Outline\\" and \\"Unbreakable Heart\\" are gonna become all-time favorites. Highly recommend this album to everyone.

030758836X|3.0|Based on reviews , introductory chapter on kindle , I read it . Normally I don't read books written by female authors , but I read \\" The Witching Hour \\" and The Wolf's Gift \\" and couldn't tell any discerning differences . But , as I assumed , this is female writing . I doubt I will read another female novelist because the line with Anne rice is nonexistent while , a womans perspective in writing isn't for me . Nevertheless , a pretty good book .It's just a little soft . She even accredits her husband at the end to sharing with her how men think . It's alright .Entertaining like some books are entertaining but just for their mediocre appeal as to what happens next .
B003B02O0A|5.0|wonderful. Very inspiring.<br />Well written and gripping at the same time. I recommend this to EVERYONE. Allows one to relive life in a time most can't relate to.

B008JAFXOQ|5.0|{4.5 Stars}<br /><br />\\"Margaret\\" plays like a good modern novel. The acting, script, and cinematography are incredibly realistic, and the story is intelligently presented without being overly artsy or high-brow.<br /><br />My take on it: After witnessing and being an unwitting participant in a tragic bus accident, bright, promising, but very frenetic NYC high school senior Lisa Cohen finds it harder than ever to find connection with anyone around her. Ironically, this prevents her from understanding why everyone around her has the same problem. As she says herself during one of the numerous altercations with her rising Broadway actress mother, \\"People don't relate to each other. . . They're totally disconnected.\\"<br /><br />On this subject, there are a lot of people screaming at each other here, and they usually don't even recall how the screaming began. They always stop screaming before it gets really tiresome, but the fights are crucial to the theme of people just acting out with no attempt to understand or empathize. The very fine acting and dialogue prevent \\"Margaret\\" from descending into what it could have been: A hackneyed soap opera/New York melodrama of the sort we've seen plenty of times before.<br /><br />I found Lisa harder and harder to take as the film progressed. Sometimes it seemed that she should be a little less of a selfish \\"drama queen,\\" but, again, this negative development may be deliberate on the part of the creators and helps pose the question of who's really crazy and who's really sane.<br /><br />There is a slow, steady tension to this film, plenty of interesting stuff happens, and there are all kinds of meaningful subplots. It often seems to meander, but everything's relevant in the end. Yet, \\"Margaret\\" is driven more by its various themes than it is by plot or character. I like it because it's so different from most current films; in fact, it's the first recent film I've seen that I'll probably want to see again. Nevertheless, people who just want to be entertained without having to sit back and analyze what they're watching will probably not want to sit through 2.5 hours of this.just want to be entertained without having to sit back and analyze what they're watching will probably not want to sit through 2.5 hours of this.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|This DVD encompasses many of P!nk's hits and some excellent cover song renditions that are a nice surprise. The show itself is a feast for the eyes and carefully sequenced for a concrete theme. More than the dancing, the acrobatics, the costumes or the sets, P!nk sings with conviction, emotion and passion. So many other \\"stars\\" today just sing songs without feeling anything at all.

0307887448|5.0|This book is just great.  It had me on the edge of my seat and excited to read it to the end.  Yes, there is a lot of pop culture and if that irritates you for some reason, then maybe you should read something else.  But otherwise, the book is well executed and it's hard to not find yourself cheering for one of the characters.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|It's been ages since I originally purchased this book on my Kindle. I saw the size of the book and when I got my Kindle it was one of the first purchases I made. I figured it would be better to carry it on that slim device than to lug around the rather large book. I wanted to read the book prior to the premier of the show but... well that didn't happen. So my goal shifted; I wanted to read the first book before the second season began and that also didn't happen. Well, I gave it a try at least. I began reading this book in April just after I moved to Virginia and didn't have a job. I would spend my mornings putting out job applications and then by late afternoon I'd sit back and read a little. But the size of this book overwhelmed me, not that I haven't read anything of this size before, but for some reason the slow moving percentage on my Kindle wasn't being very helpful. Then I got my temp job and this book was put down.<br /><br />Back and forth over the past five months I went. I would read a new book, put it down, then read 50 pages of Game of Thrones. Not only that but with trying to maintain a regularly updated book blog with ramblings about books I've read it's hard to just guarantee a number of days to read this huge book. However, I finished a book and went back to GoT for my few chapter read through and realized I was actually pretty darn close to being finished. Only, like, 200 pages left! So I read it in a flash and loved every moment of it then sat back and wondered why I hadn't just read it in one go to begin with.<br /><br />Nonetheless, let's talk about the book for the very few people out there who haven't read it. Because, it seems, I am the last person in the world who got around to starting this series. If you've seen the show it's a lot like the book; they did a very good job at portraying the characters and many of the scenes in my opinion. Still, this book is long so obviously it has much more detail and scenery than the show does. If you've seen the show but have not read the book I'd suggest doing so!<br /><br />While I wasn't keen on carrying around a copy of the book because it was so large I do wish, in a way, that I had that opportunity so that I could flip back and forth between the maps and family trees. It would have helped as the cast of the book is huge and the families are very wide spread and detailed. I have forever had issues of remembering people's names, book characters included, and had it not been for the fact that I had already watched the tv show and had faces to place with the names I probably would have been more lost as to who was who and how they were connected.<br /><br />The story is good, the imagery is good, the description is good. This book is good. If you have a fascination with anything remotely like Tudor history, Arthurian legend or the long, detailed writing in Lord of the Rings then A Song of Ice and Fire is perfect for you. Dragons, princesses, secrets and swords fill its pages and often times left my head spinning. This book has a touch of fantasy but it doesn't go overboard. You aren't stuck feeling like you just slipped into the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy or Hogwarts. It's slipped in so casually that you find yourself, whilst reading the book, to just accept what they are speaking of and not think twice about if dragons exist or the dead can rise and kill.<br /><br />Martin may put a little too much emphasis into certain details but I suspect they all come around to meaning something and he certainly helps you to picture the world he has created. It reads like some fantastic part of history yet the characters are certainly living and breathing at your ear, over your shoulder, while you go from page to page. Often times I'll read books by authors who have long since left this earth and I'm left feeling melancholy. \\"Why don't people write like this anymore? Why don't they put detail into their books and write so beautifully?\\" and I think I've discovered that there are authors who write in such ways and Martin is one of them. It's refreshing to be able to read a book so beautifully written and with such perfect detail that is current and published within my lifetime. Could it have been shortened down at some points? Certainly. Every other chapter I found at least a few pages that I could have gone without but what are you going to do? It's not like I didn't already know this was going to be a long book when I began it.<br /><br />It does have its fair share of sex scenes, incest, and rape so be forewarned of that those of you who like to avoid such plot. But it's relevant to the story, or so it seems... most of the time, so it's kind of worth talking about. Martin leaves a lot of tidbits of information through out the book which you can pick apart in your own time and wonder what it all could mean. Apparently, it's a Thing fans of the series like to do and I can understand why they would when it spans such long periods of time between publications of books. In that regard, I'm glad I waited to pick up the books so that I won't have to wait forever for each book to come out. Granted, when A Song of Ice and Fire was first published I was ten and this was way beyond my reading comprehension but at least now I can take my time, play catch up, and maybe once I'm completely caught up with the books I can join the countless others who eagerly await the next book in the series.<br /><br />I think what I liked best about the books was that the characters grow and change while you read. Often times you are able to witness how the surrounding events will alter a person or you are simply given privy to details otherwise unnoticed. I started the book with a dead set group of characters whom I liked and ones I disliked but by the end of the book that list had shuffled a little bit. Some of the characters I disliked at first (Sansa, for example) I had begun to like a little more by the end. While I have many other books I have to get through before I start A Clash of Kings I will be happy when I have that opportunity and look forward to it. There are many people out there who love this book and consider it a work of art, the best thing they had ever read, and swear by it. There are others who refuse to speak nothing but negative things about the book - it just did not work for them. For me, I liked it, I enjoyed it, and while I may not be standing on my office's roof proclaiming to the people waiting for their lunches that they must read this book - I still will quietly refer friends to it who are looking for a good tale.e are authors who write in such ways and Martin is one of them.

B00006FDCD|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about ten years old,and it scared the hell out of me.Clowns have always been creepy.But,when they try to lure little kids into sewers to eat them,that is some pretty terrifying stuff.The acting in this movie is top notch.Both the young actors and the all-star adult cast,that includes actors such as Richard Thomas and the late John Ritter.I've never read the novel before,but I can promise you one thing....this movie will scare the hell out of you too.
1451620829|5.0|I could not put this book down. This book is incredibly detailed and long. It is extremely well written and very articulate. Nobody is spared in this book. Not even himself. I am stunned by how incredibly honest this book is. Not only did he take the gloves off, he threw people under the bus while calling them names and using profanity. Sometimes I thought maybe it was a little bit \\"too much information\\", but I still loved it. Poor Ace is going to hide his face after this book. I'll leave it at that. After reading Ace's book, Gene's book and now Peter's, I have come to the conclusion that Gene is a disgusting individual in regards to hygiene. Peter is extremely hard on Paul in this book. This book brings us all the way to the present, and the present still isn't looking too bright for Peter. I hope he stays out of trouble. In summary, I am not a huge KISS fan but I loved this book. I gave Ace 3 stars. Gene got 2. This book gets 5. If you are a KISS fan you need to own this book. That's all there is to it. Worth every single penny.

B007THA4FI|2.0|I have been working at finishing this book for over two weeks now.  I've managed to get half way through in that time, despite the sleepiness that overcomes me after an hour or less.  I really should read it during the daytime!  I'm trying really hard to like the book.....I keep waiting for the story to pick up.....but, it looks like it is what it is, and that's a depressing depiction of a town full of wackos.  I have yet to find a character who is even remotely likable and I just don't look forward to my reading time with this book.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is interesting and even addictive while you figure out how to get the coins and prizes.  I bought coins at first but once you start getting prizes you can sell them for more coins.<br /><br />After the initial puzzles are complete you can earn Dozer Dollars to open the Pachinko puzzle, which like the others has 10 pieces.  Hopefully there are more puzzles after that, because just collecting coins and prizes has gotten old now that I'm past level 150.<br /><br />I gave this app 4 stars because I don't see myself playing it a year from now.  On the other hand, nobody is playing Draw Something anymore either.
B004P5RMZ2|5.0|I've loved Pink Floyd's music for about 20 years now but only discovered young Gilmour's off the charts hotness a few years ago.  Many of the early interviews, videos, and pics that you've seen of him around Youtube and the internet come from the director's cut of this film (as far as I know).  As others have already said, the concert footage itself is awesome, especially the guitar solo in Echoes.  I've also gained a whole new appreciation for Meddle (partly because of the images it conjures I suspect).  Both the director's cut and the theatrical release can be found on Youtube for those who would like to preview before they buy.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />edit: Have not experienced any technical problems with the DVD.  Hope it gets a blu-ray release with a better menu though.
B008CYDDWI|3.0|Entertaining enough to keep the attention of those that don't have much to do. Strange enough to make the mind wonder. All together decent.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I thought this would be just like Angry Birds, and thankfully it's not as I think that Angry Birds is just an average game at best. Bad Piggies is an entirely new kind of game set within the Angry Birds world. Very fun and addictive game. I highly recommend it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game expands on the puzzle nature of jewels, provides a challenge and a goal.  Minor stability issues, but thats probably more an android criticism.  Ive moved on to windows phone and am not coming back.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can read it or have it read to me. really like it. thus is one app you should have and use every day
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Quite unusual book. Not only was it entertaining, it had great imagination and provider the reader with a refresher history lesson. Great writer. Will definitely recommend this book to friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of choices. get to play hours and the best part is its all free if you want it to be. you can use real money too if that is something you would want to do but again everything can be unlocked for free.
B0090X4GJE|3.0|I absolutely loved Lights I really did but I feel really let down by Halcyon. It all just felt the same to me repetitive. I just expected more I guess.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app I own! I am truly NEVER without my Bible. I have the app in my IPhone, Kindle Fire and PC.  Therefore I can continue my reading any place any time or when I need some extra comfort. The app<br />comes with a connection to a great web site for direction on where, when, and what to read. I definitely suggest this app for everyone!
B008XG1X18|4.0|app runs pretty good on the kindle fire. took 2 attempts to download. freezes or responds slow sometimes but I am so hooked on this site I can deal with it. runs better on my fire than on my phone app so that is a huge bonus.
B008OHV5HS|5.0|I have to say that this CD has been in the player most of the time since purchase.  Great band that reminds me of groups like Yes and Asia.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I was looking for a calculator that was first easy to see and the easy to use. That's what you get here! I am very happy, but having it rotate to landscape would be helpful .
B008OOYALE|4.0|would. like to have food more easily available takes a lot of time to collect coins. to achieve. goals but overall its a fun game
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I really like this movie. I'm not really familiar with the Alien series, but I know this is a prequel. I thought it was a good story line and fantastic special effects--the 3D especially. The movie was epic. I admit, there were a few things I had a few quarrels with it, such as some of the things the supposed scientists said or did--but nothing really extreme. Overall, the film had a good since of reality, and that combined with the effect is what made it epic.<br />I highly recommend!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Totally perfect album, sound is pure and high quality. Those guys can make awesome music. This is one of the albums that must be in every household.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a great app that's easy to use. Haven't had any issues with the app at all. I would recommend this app.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase it at first but I love everything about it!!! It works and fits my phone perfectly ❤❤
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very good book. Sylvia Day makes you want more and more! I am dying for the next book! May 2013 is so far away!
0374275637|1.0|After an easy enough read that seemed mostly common sense, near end of book, we learn that he was funded to study happiness in California.  Wow.  I wouldn't expect this of Nobel Prize winner--not so much that he took the money, but that he admitted it in a big book about himself.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Didn't stink.  A little on the sappy side, but the story line was reasonable as was the acting.  Best not to watch late at night.
0425263916|5.0|I loved this book.  I read it just as quickly as the first.  These books are so much better than the Fifty Shades series.  This book has a story and isn't just about sex.  A fun book to keep you up at night wanting more.  Excited for the next book to come out!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Thor 3D came in promptly, I wanted to watch this and Captain America in preparation for The Avengers, 3D was good, audio was great!  Story was good, Thor is for sure a keeper for my 3D collection.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these for my Granddaughter in college for a couple of her classes and she told me they are amazing. You hear everything so clear.She let me hear for myself and I was amazed. I would recommend them to anybody.
1596912863|3.0|I was more of a Bronte girl and never really got hooked on Austen the way so many women my age did. That said, I've probably read more of these \\"based on Austen\\" books than I have actually read real Austen books. When I started reading Austenland, it immidiately brought to mind a similar book I'd read [[ASIN:B001G8WRGU Confessions of a Jane Austen Addict]]. I have to say in the end I like that book better as it seemed a bit more well-written with a better storyline to it.<br /><br />I did enjoy Austenland but it didn't really make me want to go there, much like Jane Erstwhile I always found myself a bit separated from the story never really feeling like I could completely fall in.
B000002U82|5.0|Nothing to say that hasn't been said a thousand times.  When I thought \\"Should I give this CD 4 stars or 5?\\" I had to think \\"If it doesn't get 5 stars, then there aren't any 5 star CDs.\\"<br /><br />But we all know that there is no dark side of the moon, really.  As a matter of fact, it's all dark.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|I missed seeing this in the movie theater and wish I had as I wouldn't of ordered it.  I was totally disappointed as the dancing, the story line, the whole movie itself made no sense.  I didn't even know who the girl was that he supposedly gave up stripping for.  If this was a true story, good luck as it had no substance.  I would of given it a half star if that were available.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This was by far the best Marvel movie released to date. Great action, even greater story line. Looking forward to more of the same.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I am not sure how to review this product, except that i'd have to read the print version to be sure that everything that was in Dickens manuscript was in the ebook. Other than that, this book was Dickens at his best.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a awesome game of hidden objects and mystery. I love playing games like this to get my mind working.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|No need for me to look further, even the free version works well, I feel one of the most usefull aps if you like music and what your listening too
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have owned this book off and on for as long as its been in print. The great thing is that I have never gotten tired of it. I bought it again so that I could have it on my tablet and I am also planning on buying an android phone and want to have it digitally. If you have never read this book you should give it a go. I read it first as a teenager and have read it up till now in my mid-thirty's. Its ageless and priceless.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I'm now playing it the second time through. got it as a faotd. I only wish amazon would deliver the same quality on all their faotd's
B004T4LUPW|2.0|Was hoping for more control when opening invitations that were generated by an Exchange client. Was able to get what I wanted with a free add-on
B00002N9ER|5.0|Don't wander around in the dark trying to find your flashlight. Get this bracket and always know where it is. Just common sense.
0817439390|5.0|Very clear, very concise guide to the basis of photography. This book has been extensively and positively reviewed in earlier editions and I can only underscore what has already been said about its value to the photographer who wants to understand why some photos work and why others do not. It is a great place for the amateur to begin the study of photography because it will drastically shorten the learning curve, but for those of us who have been shooting for a long time it still has things to teach.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Sound quality is subjective, so I won't say much about it. To me they sound great, as good as my M-Audio studio monitors. I've powered them from a Scarlett 2i2 and an internal laptop soundcard, both drive them at a fine volume. My android phone (Samsung Vibrant) is a little on the quiet side, but still usable.<br /><br />They are very comfortable. The cushions are nice and soft, and fit over my ears completely. The auto-adjusting headband feels great. They don't fit quite as snug as I'd like, but they are secure on my head.<br /><br />They feel solid, and can be wrenched around pretty good and retain their shape. I like the fact that the cord is detachable, and can be replaced if damaged. I also like the screw-on 1/4\\" adapter, which is nice and secure.<br /><br />I wanted the mkII version, as they come with a second set of cushions (velvet) and coiled cable. I feel like the velvet cushions would be less prone to sweat, and I much prefer coiled cables as they don't twist, and are good space-wise. I couldn't justify the price difference though.<br /><br />If the price difference drops to where the mkII isn't much more (say $10-$15 or so) I'd go with those. Same headphones, more bonuses. If you don't like coiled cables or velvet cushions, these are just as good.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|fifty shades had a great plot,  keept my attention till the very end.  the three book series was addicting, very hard to put it down.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Rock of Ages was very interesting to watch and I found myself bouncing around to the music throughout the entire movie. What made it more interesting was watching my sixteen year old daughter singing along as well. I would highly recommend this movie.
B007THA4FI|4.0|J. K.Rowling (or her editors) must have catered to American audiences when writing the Harry Potter series. There weren't as many British idioms in those books. The Casual Vacancy has the charm of English vernacular throughout--beginning with the book's title. While this book isn't as much of a page-turner as the Potter books, it provides a close up look at modern English society and the day-to-day challenges of living in and running a small town. The problems facing Pagford are mirrored in American society and the characters could be our next door neighbors. As with the Potter series, there are unexpected twists and turns, albeit on a decidedly adult level. A thought-provoking read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I would have given 5 stars but the game kept force closing on me when I got to a higher level. also, when I did the uninstall/reinstall it forgot who I was and I had to start the game over from the beginning. that should be fixed. Crime City is able to remember you when you have to uninstall and reinstall. this game should too.
B008NR91DO|5.0|Gary Moore, was at least in America, an under-appreciated guitarist. Janie Hendrix apparently thought enough of Gary s talent to help this event happen. I own every DVD of Gary Moore playing blues. This DVD is no exception in that watching and listening is a delight. I have not heard anyone play Jimi like this in a long time.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is very fun and addictive. when I first uploaded it, it took a while to load so I waited and then got to playing. it is very fun and I took a break just to write this.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Gives a good portrait of recent presidents, their strengths and weaknesses.  Clearly written and gripping.  I highly recommend this book.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|I've watched both the R-rated and the unrated versions of the movie, and I have to say that if you are planning to ever watch Caligula, the unrated version is the only way to go. I believe that whatever and whoever Caligula was--a brutal, eccentric, and extravagant Roman emperor, and a mentally ill and sexually promiscuous man--his life, world, and almost-four-year reign simply cannot be fully shown in a rated version.<br /><br />With movies like this one (extreme violence and explicit sex), opinions understandably run high--you either love it or hate it. I am one of those people who actually liked the film. It was thrilling and gripping, Malcolm McDowell's performance as Caligula was phenomenal, and the musical soundtrack, absolutely marvelous. Although the movie was shocking and even disgusting at times, based on what I'd ever watched or read on the ancient Romans, and on Caligula in particular, I was mostly ready for it and not very much appalled or surprised. I also found the movie  fairly historically accurate, but even if I didn't, I wouldn't have given it a different rating (unless it were fantastic and totally absurd, of course): Caligula is just a history-inspired film, not an educational documentary; it is entertainment and wasn't meant as anything but.<br /><br />As for the movie's cons, it was too long, and it dragged at some parts. Caligula was not an easy movie to watch, and two and a half hours of it was just too much. I think it could have been better if a bit shorter.<br /><br />Caligula is definitely not suitable for anyone under the age of twenty-one, but if you are not a squeamish and sensitive adult who gets easily offended, you should give it a try--you might like it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|A pretty good game that is geared towards you building a formidable kingdom with a well trained army and resources.  Worth it for Kindle FIRE!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app for FB show's me messages and a some posts, but the \\"home page\\" shows few posts from friends and more advertising.  I prefer getting FB by logging on the old fashion way...it's more personalized.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I play this game all the time. I love it. I have no complains when it comes to this game. Thank you for creating a hit.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really enjoyable. I love the music and the way you can connect with other players'  dragons. It can be a little hard and there are times when you just have to wait until you get enough money to do something but it's challenging and very fun!
B004GXZ69W|2.0|I tried this mouse for a couple of hours one evening and about three hours the following day. Not only was it unwieldy to use, my forearm hurt more than it did after a full day of using my previous mouse. Because of the location of the \\"go back\\" button near the top of the mouse, I kept hitting it accidentally, which was extremely annoying. I returned this to the tune of $9 shipping. A waste of time and money.
B005USZML4|4.0|First, I am a \\"senior\\" and I have read all of John Grisham's books.  A couple were not my \\"cup of tea\\", but this new character, Theodore Boone, is really an entraining read.  It is written in a format that both young and older will enjoy.  Typical Grisham, he weaves the story around people that you may have known.  No super hero's or wise guys, just everyday people that happen to stumble into interesting situations. I am giving this book to my Granddaughters (3&6) for Christmas. I would recommend the book to everyone.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Loved the movie just sci-fi enough to scratch that itch and just horror enough not to freak you out. The end was pretty twisted but I wont give that away.
B005FISC52|4.0|This product was very well packaged and arrived in a good amount of time. Loved the show And the price was perfect.
B005IDXIL2|1.0|It was 3D all right, but didn't play all that well. I have played other bowling games and have more fun. Thank goodness this was a free app or I would have wasted money.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|Excellent showcase of Barbra's superb vocal and interpretive talents. Exquisite release from the first track to the last.  Definitely will not disappoint.  The track from Fijian's Rainboelw is my rave.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good streaming quality. Sometimes pauses due to \\"buffering,\\" but probably connectivity issue... Only complaint about Amazon streaming... It should be allowed overseas for active duty servicemembers... I do not have cable in Japan, so must watch these shows online.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I watched these guys on You-tube and had to have the CD.<br />Watching you tube lets you see how they did the music.<br />LOVE IT!
B0096HIEE2|3.0|This was actually a bit better than I expected.<br />Some characters are fun and a couple try to be complicated. Of course there is music,  skin, drugs, and an awkward love story that tries to find it's way.<br /> I watched because my friends wanted to see it. I would have never chosen to watch this on my own but if you enjoy this genre; check it out... I think you could do worse.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I'm in college and my prof. introduced me to this site. After watchibg a few videos I was hooked on the Ted site. i quickly downloaded the app on my roku, smart phone, and was very happy to see it on the app store for my kindle! This app allows me to download videos so that i can watch when not connected to wifi, watch 1000+ Ted talks with new updates weekly. i can also select to listen to only the audio if i dont feel like watching the video which is a plus! Seeing a few reviews that were negative made me skeptical, but dont take their word for it. Try this app out for yourself. Honestly you won't regret it.
B008KE3960|5.0|awesome fun gameplay  done right.  has some difficulty to it the higher in levels you go which makes it fun......
B0063IH60K|5.0|Better than a deck of cards anyday! Love to be able to pick up where I left off if I have to make a run. The visual effects are a little outdated but the challenge is well appreciated!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I am too young to remember the old tv show dark shadows,however I have been able to watch via internet and other outlets. Yes, this show was on the cheezy side, but it was suppose to be that way. That being said, it was a great movie that kept me entertained for a little while and did not require much thought. :)
030758836X|1.0|I am confused by all the fantastic reviews of this book. Once I started reading it I discovered that the main characters (Nick and Amy) were both totally disgusting. I felt like the author was just jerking me around throughout the book from one chapter to the next in the way he alternately changed the readers opinion of Nick and Amy. The characters were really warped and the story line was totally unbelievable. I didn't enjoy this book at all and had to drag myself through to the end. The end was the most disappointing part. My goal for reading a book is to be entertained and this book left a very bad taste in my mouth. I am confused by all the fantastic reviews of this book.

B00866H7SS|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book and it was just as exciting the second time round :)
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I was very surprised at the quality of Cornwell's latest book.  It skipped from one scenario to the next and never developed a plot that held my interest.  She seems very intent to impart her knowledge to the detriment of the story.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Was not entirely happy with the ending, but overall a good read. I am somewhat surprised that this is considered a “young person's book as it has some very adult concepts as to social dynamics and politics.
B000HEVALC|5.0|Don't expect a polished and perfect cd. This was just a last minute thought to record the hottest entertainers in the world! I absolutely love the talking between songs. It makes you feel like you are in the room. These guys are telling stories of when they were on stage or even part of the audience. The songs and music are almost like a get-together around the holidays when Grandma says &#34;why don't y'all sing me a song?&#34;<br />At some points, the music is too loud and you can barely hear the singing and other times its just the opposite. It is what it is...a recording of some guys getting together and having a good time! I am a big fan of Elvis and Jerry Lee so hearing them in their &#34;natural state&#34; is special to me.<br />As the Killer says....&#34;Keep on Rockin'!&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I think this app is great. I have it on hand whenever I need it and it is easy to use. I think it will be great for anyone who likes to keep track of there spending or what have you.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is pretty fun and is very enjoyable. I like playing this game when I have nothing to do nd am bored.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome  because there's so many games you can play in one app.  its also awesome because you get lots of points for the games.
159420411X|5.0|I've enjoyed reading Nate Silver's 538 blog since I learned of it during the 2008 election season.  He was a breath of fresh air then, and remains so today.  In my profession, I involve myself with creating, analyzing, and teaching about mainly deterministic predictive models of fluids, using models similar in spirit to those Silver describes which have had success in giving us better predictions of the weather.  Silver does an outstanding job conveying to a lay audience their strengths and weaknesses.  Not every detail is perfect; Lorenz's seminal work \\"Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow\\"  appeared in 1963; Silver only recognizes some later work.  Nevertheless, Silver is properly appreciative and skeptical of determinism, a quality which is missing from the writings of some celebrators of \\"Big Data.\\"  He did himself and his readers a service in consulting with MIT's Kerry Emanuel, one of the more temperate experts on greenhouse effect modeling whose serious scientific writings have persuaded me of many things.<br /><br />Silver also effectively captures some of my concerns regarding predictions that have weaker foundation in a priori models but are nevertheless of great potential utility to humankind.  He has a nice discussion of the role of statistics and Bayesian inference that properly should be associated with such predictions, and does the world a service in asking us to consider the track record of public prognosticators as we decide how much credence to lend to their thoughts.<br /><br />He is to be commended for taking on a broad variety of subjects in today's world where prediction is used.  Any general reader should not be put off by the quibbling expert in such fields, as no doubt Silver has missed a nuance or two.  Most readers will be rewarded by gaining, as did I, a better appreciation of how prediction is critical to our modern world, and how to ask skeptical questions of modern-day snake-oil salespeople.
1401322786|5.0|A great fable about the meaning of time in all of our lives. I couldnt put it down read it in a 2 days. I got tears in my eyes at some points and others left me thinking wow. A new appreciation for the meaning of time, Do you fear time running out? I love the way it is written and it flows quickly and suspenseful.  Mitch is a wonderful storyteller. If you are like me, it will leave you appreciating and loving life and having a greater respect for time! I dont want to tell to much or give any spoilers but it is a great short read and the characters are awesome, Dor, Sara, Victor are the main ones and I definitely related a lot to Sara because she is a bit chunky and in high school and has been teased and taunted by kids and she thinks she meets the boy of her dreams....I too was teased thru out school for this and it hits home! Thank you Mitch for a great book 5* definitely! Buy it you wont be disappointed or gift it good for teens to granmies!
193609648X|5.0|This book is gorgeous to look at.  30 patterns using Noro's unusual yarns to their best advantage.  Most crocheters I know who love Noro yarns, have also struggled with how to use them best for crochet.<br /><br />There are simpler, almost guaranteed beautiful projects like the felted bag, or the granny cowl and yet there are the shawl patterns that emphasize the brilliant colors; and sweaters /tunic patterns with enough room for an experienced crocheter to tinker with them to make the item perfect for the wearer.<br /><br />I intend to make several designs from this book; maybe not all with Noro yarns, but definitely inspired by them.  That is how I see this book most of all, as an inspiration to make your own masterpiece.
0385535147|2.0|I am a man of eternal hope.  Many years ago, I started reading Grisham with \\"The Pelican Brief\\" and \\"The Firm\\" and thought \\"Hey, this guy is COOL!\\"  Then came the dark years of one boiler plate effort after another until I finally gave up.  Until the recent rave reviews for \\"The Racketeer.\\"<br /><br />Alas, naif that I am, I was again taken in by another excellent example of marketing hype.<br /><br />The basic premise of the story is simple:  Malcolm Bannister, a simple, small time lawyer is wrongly jailed as part of a federal investigation of financial fraud.  In the real world, a federal judge and his mistress are brutally murdered, leaving the FBI and Justice Department chasing their tails in a mad tizzy and getting nowhere.  In desperation, they offer a $150,000 reward for information on the killer(s).  Enter our hero who promises them the name and motive of the killer in return for a full pardon, entry into the witness protection program and, of course, the $150,000.  Some gnashing of teeth by the arrogant feds but they finally (of course) agree and Bannister is released.<br /><br />Up to this point a very good story, tightly written, with excellent character development and a \\"what the heck is going on?\\" plot.  But then all falls apart.  For the next 100 pages, our hero becomes involved in murkier and murkier schemes, constantly twisting our belief and the rules of basic logic.  Need to get from point A to point B?  Hire a private jet.  Need to start a fake business?  Hire a corporate lawyer.  How about an unscrupulous dealer in precious metals?  Look in the yellow pages.  And while all of this is going on, keep telling the reader over and over, \\"damn, when I planned this two years ago, I NEVER thought it would really work!\\"<br /><br />The author used an irritating style of switching from Bannister speaking in first person to relating the activities of various federal agents and, of course, drop dead accomplices, in third person.  The basic premise is apparently to build this beautifully complicated story with all of the parts carefully interlinked.  What he winds up with a large tangled mess of twine.<br /><br />Indeed, the ball becomes so complicated that the last chapter is essentially the English drawing room scene from countless Sherlock Holmes and Miss Marple mysteries.  In this case, Grisham actually has Bannister tell the reader \\"OK, this is what you thought was happening, but this what we really were doing.\\"  By this time you are so disgusted with the entire mess you couldn't care less who is really the villian, who is really my long lost buddy or whether the entire Federal government can really be that stupid.<br /><br />All in all, a useless waste of time.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|the update sucks. it will only play for about 30 seconds then it will freeze up. I will be deleting this game now!<br />I use to love this game now I hate it.
0811876373|5.0|I thought this was a little silly when I bought it but we have had a lot of fun making the cake pops. A few tricks we learned as we went along: after dipping the sticks in melted icing slide sticks into the cake pops and put them into the fridge to cool before completely covering with icing. Otherwise the cake pops can drop off the sticks. I also found that making the cake recipes from scratch and adding lots of spice dramatically improved the quality of the cake pops. My favorites were penguins made with cinnamon dark chocolate fudge cake. We have also made birthday present cake pops and simple pumpkin spice balls with vanilla icing and colors swirled around the pops.
0345803485|1.0|So poorly written. I'm fairly certain the author has multiple personalities because it seemed one moment to be written by an oversexed adolescent then a philosophy student with a dictionary glued to their hand then Scarlet O'Hara made her writing debut. Anastasia Steele is a simpering nitwit and a pathetic excuse for a character. It was repetitive and uninspired. It should be filed under horribly written fanfiction rather than bestseller. If you want to read something clever and well written with some good sex scenes thrown in try J.D Robb's \\"Eve Dallas\\" books. In closing whoever edited the 50 Shades books deserves to be chained up in the middle of Pittsburgh to have rotten tomatoes and eggs thrown at your face. You should be ashamed of yourself! If I hear anyone say \\"Jeez\\", \\"Oh my\\", \\"Oh wow\\", or refer to their female region as \\"down there\\" I'm going to punch them in the face!
0316228532|4.0|Another winner from J.K. Rowling, but if you are looking for Harry Potter, you have picked up the wrong book.  This is the story of a town where the vacancy of a council seat moves people to act as if at war with each other.  It shows what can happen when the need for power goes astray.  Each character in turn must come to grips with their own truths before the ending reveals who wins.  Yes, it is good vs evil (which Harry Potter has too), but this is at the adult level, which is more dangerous.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|its a good product. it works and its funny to listen to. the only thing i dont like is that on my kindle fire i have to talk right into the microphone. and i have to talk loud. sometimes it doesnt always catch everything i say, but i love this app
B001AQO3QA|5.0|When I saw this on sale at Best Buy, it was a no-brainer.  This has to be one of the best collections of a movie series out there.  The package is strongly and neatly designed with a thick cardboard insert with eleven pages holding all four films and two extra discs - \\"The making of the Alien Anthology\\" and \\"The Alien Anthology Archives\\".  To say this set is exhaustive is a mild comment.  It is massive and stuffed to the hilt.  There is also a \\"MU-TH-UR Mode Viewer's Guide\\" and an explanation of the \\"unbound\\" experience that bridges your viewing between discs with `MU-TH-ER mode'.  The two deeply-loaded BD-50 discs packed full of supplements are fantastic.  Navigating through them is simple.  You can simply watch it straight through or use the `MU-TH-ER mode' to `tag' subjects.  This acts as a memory tag so you can come back later and watch those scenes.  This is handy in all six discs.<br /><br />Each film has the theatrical version and the director's cut.  One of the great things about these versions is that the director's cut does not always include the same scenes or endings!  You can select a director's cut and choose to mark (a little checked box) to appear if the scene is deleted from the original.  It's amazing what they cut and left in.  \\"Alien 3\\" for example had a less violent ending in the director's cut than the theatrical cut, which seemed odd.  The ending of \\"Alien Resurrection\\" has a totally different ending in the director's cut.  And on it goes.  You can even watch several different angles of critical scenes, like when the alien pops out of John Hurt (it can be overkill - yuk, yuk).<br /><br />The Blu-ray version is spectacular in detail and color and the 5.1 surround sound is crisp and perfectly balanced.  It is just a great repackaging!<br /><br />I am impressed with the total packaging and figure I will eventually watch all seventy something hours of it over a long period of time.  I recommend you read the first three reviews here on Amazon.com, if you want more detailed information - or just go out and buy this monster set!if you want more detailed information - or just go out and buy this monster set!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was so interesting it had me on my feet the whole time! Now i m going to finish the entire series! :)
B006LSZECO|2.0|Loved the initial character development, but I felt like the ending was much too patched together and not at all logical based on the initial character traits.  Very disappointing ending.
B0055S348W|4.0|This is a great app.  It supports Google Docs (now Drive)... but not SkyDrive or DropBox.  I'll give 5 stars when it adds those.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Wow, this game brings back a lot of memories. I have played many a breakaway clones and playing this reminded me how much I loved them. This proved to be exciting to play and well worth picking up, especially for just a dollar. Word of advise, put your finger at the bottom of your screen, this way you can scroll back and forth and still have a clear look at your block at the bottom. Took me a while to figure this out, the bottom looks un-playable as it shows all your upgrades and downgrades, but play in there. It lets you see the best when you play that way.<br /><br />Lots of fun, but keep in mind that this is the type of game that really does it for me.
1451695187|5.0|This book provided exciting confirmation of my very deeply held beliefs. I have a personal relationship with God that I cherish, although I am far from religious. I have always felt that science and spirituality are one in the same, not separate. In fact, we are all one in the same with God, never separate. God is in everyone of us and all around us. God is everything. Quantum physics may be the bridge to understanding this hard to grasp concept.<br /><br />When you are able to take in the true reality, the true beauty and phenomenon that is going on around us all day, every day, you can easily accept the concept of science and spirit all together as one. A concept that Einstein, The Dalai Lama and countless other respected individuals have tried to convey through out history.<br /><br />This book does a wonderful job at explaining how this can be, as well as explaining tons of other really mind blowing stuff. I just want to say a HUGE thank you Dr. Alexander for this wonderful description of what you saw in your journey to the after life. I appreciate you sharing everything you experienced and even more so the fact that you compared it to your understandings of the brain. Your comparison of the brain as a sort of filter or regulator for the ever-powerful soul was an eye opening thought. This book was awesome and I hope he writes several more!!! I am sure he has only touched on a portion of what he came to understand while \\"up there\\". This book is a true classic and a great tool aiding in the shift of consciousness that is taking place on our planet right now. Great job!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|the music is great; tom cruise was funny.  the movie itself was not worth the price.  overall download was easy.
0345472322|4.0|Well, it's nothing that I haven't heard before but it was delightful to spend several hours being validated and cheered on. Well worth $10 which I will revisit when I need to be reminded about how important this is.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth does an amazing job in this movie! His acting and his stammer are flawless.  That might sound a bit odd, but it's true.  Listening to him speak in this film, you wouldn't know he didn't actually have an impediment.<br /><br />Helen Bonham Carter does fantastic, as always.  And the doctor, whom I don't know his name, does absolutely wonderful!  I was enthralled with the scenes where he was teaching \\"Bertie.\\"  Many of them were hilarious.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite true-story-based film, and I wasn't even expecting the like it when I saw the trailer!<br /><br />Oh.. and the speech scene... there are no words.  Simply amazing and so well done.
B008BM9L72|3.0|While I found the first book initially very hard to put down,because of its lurid sex scenes which frankly were quite shocking to me and therefore educational, I soon tired of the repetative nature & frequency of the sex scenes and the banal texting. I found it very hard (excuse the pun) to suspend disbelief by midway through the second book as anyone who suffered what the main female character had suffered by this stage, would not only surely have been literally worn out but probably dead from frustration with that silly man, too. As a woman, I found the suggestion that one should just abandon oneself to the unknown, sexually and otherwise, because the man is goodlooking and wealthy...as quite an offensive proposal and positively unsafe. I would not recommend this trilogy to my teenage daughter under any circumstances.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a cover for my wife to use while travelling. Her other cover does not have a screen protector.  In addition this cover can prop up the Fire so she can use it in the near verticle mode.
B007MG360G|5.0|Another goofy addition to the doodle god set. It's a Great way to kill some time during a long commute!
0316044695|5.0|I want to start off by thanking Marcus Luttrell for writing this book and opening the eyes to the world. We lost some amazing heroic men on that mountain and without this book their story would have never received the recognition that it truly deserved.<br /><br />This was a hard book to put down. The story is well written and keeps the reader engaged through its entirety. I loved the detailed accounts of BUD/S training. Marcus makes you feel like you are right there getting \\"wet and sandy\\" with him. If you want a true thriller/suspense story that is gushing with heroism then this book is for you. If you cant handle his political views then this book is not for you and you can go on pretending these important events never happened and you can go stick your head in the sand and stay there. I feel this book is required reading. My wife is reading it now and I have recommended it to a lot of friends and family. This book makes you want to bear hug a Navy SEAL!
B0089IGUP4|5.0|I will say that I am new to The Gaslight Anthem. I found out about them after seeing lead singer Brian Fallon's interview on the recent documentary about The Replacements called Color Me Obsessed. I was happy to hear his words about the band and it made me interested in checking his band out. Little did I know that they are one of the most iconic bands at the moment. After enjoying their previous albums, paticularly The '59 Sound, I came into their latest record, Handwritten, with high expectations and I was blown away. This is wonderful music and Brian Fallon is an amazing songwriter.<br /><br />The Gaslight Anthem have been compared to Bruce Springsteen quite a bit and it was also one of the reasons why I became interested in them and while their are some qualities of the Boss in their music, it also has elements of all different kinds of influences that makes them a wonderful listening experience. Fallon has really grown as a songwriter since the band was formed in 2006 and it shows on this album. Always writing from the point of view of a passionate human being with hopes and dreams but also, a lot of lonliness and longing.<br /><br />I highly reccommend this record to any music fan, they have a wide range of appeal and can be enjoyed by many. Simple yet beautiful and heartfelt, it shouldn't be missed.
0061122416|5.0|This changed my life -- and continues todo so every time I read it. I encourage everyone to pick this up and evaluate your life an your journey toward self actualization.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|As a prequel, it seems a little jumbled, with a few minimal surprises in plot twists. When things are down to the nitty-gritty, the last remaining 'Ancestor' could have completed his diatribe at humanity and told Shaw why he was ticked off at us. David was typically two-faced as the 'artificial human' creations seem to practice for the Weyland ilk. The 'unexpected sleeper' was one of the real surprises, along with the unexpected 'blessing' that Shaw received. I didn't really expect such a radical result of her pregnancy, even though it all 'turned out for the good' in the end, for Shaw. Obviously, the ending left room for a sequel, but the time window will have to be strictly observed and events occur rapidly to avoid 'crashing into' Ripley on her trip back to Earth... All in all, the hype exceeded the results, but it was still watchable. I must confirm that the character portrayed by Charlize Theron was exceedingly harsh and unfeeling, revealing, to me at least, a different aspect of her acting abilities that were both impressive and unpleasant. Personally, I hope to never see her in that portrayal mode again. I had not seen Prometheus before viewing it in my home, but the movie was OK, overall, just not as good, nor as entrancing, as I thought it would be.
0060527986|5.0|The most encouraging and humanistic readi have had in some time. I felt like, finally, someone got me and what I was going through. Powerful and motivating stuff. Great for superheroes who have lost their way...
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I've enjoyed Thor, Captain America and both Iron Man movies. This combines the best of allof them. Just a whole lot of fun. I would defintely watch it again.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like the alarm options, sleep options. I also like the face appearence. Although I am looking for a clock to use when I travel with my Kindle. I need to have a wifi to connect to in order to have the correct time. I geuss I need to set the new location that has no wifi before going. I wish the app had a manual time setting when needed on the clock.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I was disappointed in this. I expected something smarter and funnier. It was just a bit boring.Johnny Depp didn't see to be putting an effort into his performance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so amazing! I was so into it I hardly got any sleep these last couple of days!
B008WCP2KG|3.0|It came very fast. It is an okay movie... lots of naked men and stripping... If you are a lonely 40 year old cat lady this movie is for you!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awesome. you breed dragons and its land. You don't even have to buy anything as u can receive gold from neighbors. Great game if u don't want to spend money.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Starts out slow but you get more involved as it goes on. Great visual effects.<br />Like Johnny Depp movies always entertaining.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This prequel did not live up to its expectations. Visually it was interesting but there really weren't any new ideas here.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have looked at a number of calendars and this is by far, the best! I can put all of my appointments on it and it I get a reminder of the upcoming appointments that I have.  I can also make ongoing lists--like my grocery list and it is there any time I look.  This is just what I was looking for.  Totally love this notepad and calendar!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A must read regardless of genre. Was difficult to put down. Can't wait for the next ones to come out.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This amazing sequel has wonderful text and a great structured story! The plot has great success and I look forward to the next book!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Loved this story was kept gripped the whole time and did not want it to end I can't wait for the next one x
B00280LYIM|5.0|Percy's life really gets exciting in this great chapter at Camp Half-Blood. More Greek legendary characters are revealed and the images keep going wild and the fun and the humor never stops with Riordan!<br />Fox is unclear whether they will release a movie on this.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is great and continues to tell the captivating story of Ana and Christian! On to the next book!
B00280LYIC|5.0|A great story for beginning readers of Riordan. It introduces Percy Jackson as a kid that shows great skill as the son of Poseidon, the Greek God of the sea. It has compelling images in the text and it is for 3rd to 5th grade readers. Fox has released a movie on this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Really enjoy the whole Angry Birds series.  This one is fun.  The ads can be annoying, but on my Kindle they are not so troublesome, maybe because of the bigger screen.
0439023513|5.0|This final installment will take the breath out of you. Collins has put everlasting pictures of Katniss and Peeta's adventures as Katniss plots to overthrow the government from evil President Snow and save Peeta, who is poisoned by Snow. A great conclusion!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This movie is such a rip off of Alien, dont waste your money on Prometheus.  The plot lines are so similar, and even both aliens could be twins, they looked so much alike.  I am surprised Ridley Scott, who also directed Alien, would direct this poor imitation.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is a completely new series, but Riordan manages to create a whole new world about Roman mythology and mix it together with real life! I can't believe that Riordan has created another good read!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book which is surprising because I'm a dude. Definitely an amazing tragic love story that anyone can relate to.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is like a great fiction story mixed with a guide to Egyptian Gods. These characters have lots of wit and this book is a great introductory to Egypt!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The movie might be great but I wouldn't know.  I've been trying to download this to my iPad for days, but it took so long I gave up.<br />I will never use Amazon movie rentals again.  Lesson learned.
0439023491|5.0|This #1 sequel has amazing quality as an upbeat movie and as a good story. It captures the amazing adventures of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark when they are forced to play in a second Hunger Games, only this time, more danger than before.
B008OOYALE|5.0|its fun. playing with others dragons is nice too. I like seeing what others do with the things they get . it give me a chance to see what I can do when I get to higher levels.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The final installment ends the series with a dramatic story about the evil titan Kronos and his predicted reign of the world. Again, this book has stunning text and a great story to end it.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I tore through this book in record time - it was a well paced Jack Reacher adventure and will ensure I'm back for the next one!
0439023521|5.0|I think that this book is an amazing starter for the Hunger Games! Collins has great potential as a Newbery medalist! I love the colorful images painted in the text and the descriptions are really vivid!
B009YG2ND8|2.0|I haven't actually boy gut this app but I am a huge fan of Final Fantasy (but I prefer Elder Scrolls) I would gladly buy this app for0.99$-6.99$ but 14.99$ really
034580404X|5.0|This series is great. My aunt let me borrow the first book and not even half way through I decided I HAD to have the set for myself. I don't understand why people talk bad about this book. Erotic romance has been around for a long time. Anne Rice wrote the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy in the 80s and its way more graphic than Fifty Shades. All in all, I love the books. Definitely a must buy!
B004RLPTT0|5.0|I love the soundtrack to the movie! The download occurred successfully, and I now have the soundtrack to one of my favorite movies. Thanks, Amazon!
B007QRWXJG|4.0|A very densely plotted episode, with all kinds of threads going here and there, some reaching conclusion, some continuing: Betty's health scare (and weight gain), the Rolling Stones, the new Jewish copywriter hire etc. One can really sense the generational divide between those still in thrall to the World War II generation (even 20 something Pete and Peggy are still attached to that generation) and the new \\"don't trust anyone over 30\\" generation, personified by the young Rolling Stones fan. \\"Why won't you let us just have fun?\\" she asks Don and this theme seems to keep being repeated throughout, by Harry, by Roger, by Megan.<br /><br />Once in a while you see the old Don, adverstising genius reappear, like when he quizzes the girl about what she \\"feels\\" when she hears the Stones (and is shocked by the reply), just like when in Season 1 he quizzes the black waiter what he feels when he smokes Luckies.<br /><br />The sets continue to amaze in their authenticity. Don and Betty started out in their cookie cutter Colonial in Ossining---Don moved on up to a swank haute-60's coop on the Upper East Side that is just a blaze of colors and browns and fabrics, while Betty somehow ended up in a Victorian mausoleum (I thought in season 4 they talked about \\"buying a place\\" although no one bought Victorians back then). Also, I'm totally mystified by Mrs. Francis, who looks like she could be their cleaning lady not Henry's blue blood mother.<br /><br />Best inside joke line was Henry Francis shouting into the phone that Mayor Lindsay was not going to be standing next to Romney \\"who's a clown.\\" For the younger viewers, that's Gov. George Romney of Michigan, father of the current Presidential candidate.
B0091REZMW|4.0|a fun game. wish it didn't take so much energy to complete a room and wish there weren't so many of those creatures floating around the game board.
B001KZG99A|5.0|iron man is quite possibly the best superhero movie of our generation.. that good! if you don't like it, you don't like movies... done
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Downloaded this for my Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; and it works beautifully. Must have of you roam the dark at night!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I have no idea why games such as these make the human brain keep going back for more. Just trying to get \\"the newest and best\\" stuff...
1936891026|2.0|As someone who wants to write but struggles, this book seemed like it might be right up my alley. Unfortunately I found it a bit too oblique to be much use.<br /><br />It essentially characterises your writer's block and lack of motivation as this powerful force called 'resistance' that is apparently lurking everywhere and trying to distract us and hold us back at every corner. Even ignoring the obvious biblical connotations of that, it's a bit too dramatic for me.<br /><br />The word 'angel' crops up quite often too, and while the author does briefly touch on the fact that you can substitute that word for muse if you're not a believer, it doesn't change the overall feeling and direction of the book.<br /><br />In terms of content, I found the book pretty short, and lacking on actual practical advice. There's a few useful tips scattered throughout, but all in all it wasn't for me.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is fun to play<br />it gets annoying how you have to wait to get energy<br />also you have to do stuff in an online  mode in order to complete some missions
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I got this for my Kindle Keyboard, which was called the Kindle 3 right up until the Kindle Touches and original Kindle Fire came out. First of all, it fits it perfectly, and I really can't imagine why anyone would say that it doesn't unless they have something else that causes a bit of bulk already covering their device, or maybe they are referring to the Kindle Fire?, I don't know. I myself have a DecalGirl decorative sticker covering the front and back, but that is like nothing in bulk and causes no problems. The packaging states that this is a size \\"Medium\\" cover, and that works and is compatible with: Kindle Fire, Kindle Keyboard, as well as most NOOK, KOBO, and Sony e-readers and 7\\" tablets. I can only speak for the Kindle Keyboard or call it the Kindle 3 if you want, and like I said it's a perfect fit.<br /><br />I love this cover. The color is a deep muted rich red, (it looks just like it picture online to me) the calligraphy is eye pleasingly elegant, and the feel is soft and smooth inside and out. If you feel like you need something to hold it shut there are inexpensive hairbands available where brushes are sold, even cute ribbony ones in stores that will do the trick easily. This is a very nice cover to have for your Kindle.
B005KELW26|4.0|I really like this cover for my Kindle Fire HD.  I purchased it from Amazon.  My Kindle fits nicely in the cover and has the magnetic clasp that keeps it closed. If I had thought more about it, I might have bought a cover that has the stand feature.  Great product though.<br />Nancy Segala
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Genius.  Funny, great story, engaging.  But the themes and content are for adults - I wouldn't let my child see this before 12 at the minimum.  The story line follows the theme of many great hero films, but is rich with movie call backs, tributes to western genre, and most of all themes of self discovery, and finding your place in the world.<br /><br />But light and funny at the same time.  Well done.
B0081BU42O|5.0|I couldn't wait for Banks' next Culture novel, and I wasn't disappointed. He is amazing. The conversations between the ship's Minds are worth the price of the novel alone.<br />If only our civilization were 1/10 as 'cultured' as Banks'.
0739350323|5.0|This series of books, there are six, is well worth a read.<br /><br />You may be led to beehive that the books a aimed at kids, but I enjoyed them immensely and would recommend them to anyone of any age
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Pretty bizaar but quick paced and a very different book from Crouch. Definately an enjoyaqble read.I loved the ending! Not what you expect.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|think this game is the best and everybody should give it a 5 star. I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Well acted, great costumes, and a interesting twist on history.  I have not read the book, so I don't know if it followed the sames story line, but the movie stood up well on it's own.
B0086700CM|5.0|cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool its so so so &ccedil;ool wait can people read this oh no!!!!!!
B004QL7K70|2.0|The film starts off by informing the viewer that the events in the film are fictional and that all the stunts are performed by actors, but by the end of it you're likely to forget about that. Especially since they added the little \\"after-bio\\" right before the credits started. When that popped up my first thought was \\"was this based off something that really happened? o.O\\" Then my brain turned on again and I remembered the warning at the beginning.<br /><br />This film is labeled as a comedy, but I don't see how. There wasn't anything comedic about it. It was just a party gone very, very wrong. That's really all this movie is, it's a party film. There's a lot of scene's where you just see the party going on and they have music playing. Maybe it's because I'm not a party person, but the entire movie felt very lifeless. This is the third movie in a week that I've seen that had a lot of potential, but they didn't capitalize on it.<br /><br />It's filmed as if it were a home movie, with Dax Flame \\"filming\\" it the entire time. Me personally, I would've liked to see more of Dax. It took me a while to remember what I saw him in, but for those of you still having trouble he was in 21 Jump Street. His character seemed to be the one I liked best, even though he only had a total of like 5 lines.<br /><br />Throughout the movie you see a lot of drinking, dancing, topless women, and Thomas, the guy throwing the party, freaking out. What I don't get is why do they always have these movies where the outcasted kid throws the party and he winds up being paranoid the entire time? We all know that kind of thing never happens. It's always the \\"popular\\" people that throw the party. Granted, his paranoia soon became reality as the party escalated and turned into a small riot.<br /><br />By the end of it nothing really stuck with me. There were a few things here and there like Thomas jumping off of the roof or the kid getting punched by the neighbor, but other than that it isn't very memorable. What this film does do well is make you feel like you're actually there. By doing so watching this is kind of like an adrenaline rush, but sadly that's the only strong thing about the movie.<br /><br />Overall Score: 4/10 - After watching this my reaction was \\"meh.\\" When I saw the previews this movie looked like it was going to be crazy, and it could have been, but the end result is only mildly entertaining. If you're looking to check it out I would suggest renting it first.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|It was good to read the first book as all the other books refer to the serial murder in Sydney.  I think the later books are better, but I still loved this book and cant wait for the second book to be translated - The Cockroaches.  Does any one know when this is happening.
0439023513|5.0|It came in time and there is nothing wrong with the book and i liked the book too so yeah its all good.
1455519006|4.0|I received this book for free via Goodreads Giveaway program.<br /><br />If you are willing to suspend disbelief through the first part of the story, you will be treated to a multi-layered conspiracy theory with a cold blooded CIA assassin as the main protagonist.<br /><br />Some of the initial operations seemed overly complex, with the mission details resembling a Rube Goldberg machine.  Will Robie, the main character, has a lack of feelings that border on psychotic.  So it was difficult to understand his attachment to the innocent, and his reasons for choosing his lifestyle are never fully explained.  These details are why I ended up giving the book a 4 star rating instead of 5.<br /><br />However if you could look beyond these minor quibbles, Baldacci's story delivers non stop action combined with intriguing conspiracy that all makes sense in the end.  I could not put the book down during the last half of the story as I was eager to know what happened.  I highly recommend The Innocent and I will soon be checking out more of Baldacci's works.
0439023483|4.0|It came in time and there is nothing wrong with the book and i liked the book too so yeah its all good.

B000S5360S|5.0|This album takes me back high school. This band was never meant to take seriously kind of like The Darkness. This was just a side project for Queens drummer. Its good fun rock that sounds great.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoyed his latest effort combining several previous favorites.  It wasn't rocket science but it was an enjoyable read.  If you like DeMille, you'll like the book.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|At first I was bit hesitant about this awesome continuing with out Andy Witfield, but great news...it works!From the awesome conclusion of the first season and coming off from the great prequel the second season is a great addition to this epic story. Adds new characters, brings important passed ones, ties up loose ends from the first season and great conclusion leading up to the third and final season
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I know some folks who were dazzled by the special effects completely missed how bad the story was, that they will vehemently disagree with me but this is my opinion, you can have yours.<br />I gave this movie 2 stars only because of the tie in with the alien movie.<br />Yes some swear it is not a prequel but it is from the first gen face hugger,the first gen alien,to the spacecraft itself. (watch the original alien and judge for yourself.<br /><br />arthur's review is one of the best (take the quiz for yourself), and read his one star review and you'll see why I agreed with him,and many others.( go,go, goto the one stars and read and take the quiz it's great fun!)<br /><br />No scientists would act the way those idiots did.<br /><br />I hope the sequel is better (if there is one.)

B00280LYIC|5.0|Rick Riordan has hit on a winning formula in the Percy Jackson series! Lots of adventure aimed directly at the 10-13 year old reluctant reader. The story line and characters are as addictive as Rowling's Harry Potter books, but instead of using wizardry and witchcraft, Riordan empowers his heroes and heroines through the magic of Greek mythology. Tons of monster-fighting, problem-solving, and even a bit of age-appropriate romance thrown in as the characters age along with the target audience. As a reader, a parent, and a middle-school English teacher, I cannot say enough good about Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief! At least a dozen parents have thanked me for introducing this story to their sons, who would not read a book until this one came along, and who have now read and re-read the entire series. I even know of some teenagers (both boys and girls) who had a race to see who could finish the latest book first! Not only are they entertained by these stories, but they are also learning about the root mythology of Western civilization while traveling to all the major landmarks of the U.S.A. (and, in the Heroes of Olympus series, across the Atlantic to Europe as well); when they get on to high school and have to study Homer's Odyssey and Iliad, they are making straight A's without effort! Last year I read the series aloud to my son, who has always been a struggling reader, and now he is re-reading it independently and loving it even more the second time around. DO NOT BE TURNED AWAY BY THE POOR MOVIE ADAPTATION!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Having heard so many reviews of this book I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't.  I didn't even finish the book.... it was that bad.  I have read other BDSM book that were quite good and very realistic.<br /><br />It seemed more like a fantasy from someone who dreams of living in the BDSM world but hasn't experienced it themselves yet.  As if they were going by what others have written.  Of course having the \\"Master\\" rich and single just made it even more unappealing.  Also the BDSM activities in the book were more kinky than BDSM.<br /><br />Having experienced aspects of BDSM myself I saw the flaws and it totally ruined it for me.  Living it is really much better than this story tellers story.  Masters that I have known in real life were nothing like the Master in the story.
B001TH16DI|1.0|I was very disappointed.  I bought this because my father loves Star Trek...He has a bluray player and I thought this was perfect.  However, when my father opened it up and even though the packaging was for the Blu Rays all of the discs were DVDs instead.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!
B0090EJR1K|5.0|I saw there were several negative reviews for this movie so I wasn't sure if I would rent it or not.  After debating I decided to go ahead and rent it.  While there was a lot of adult humor it was still funny.  And the discussion in the chopper was my favorite part of the movie.  But it's just not a film I would want to watch over and over so I'm glad that I just rented it and didn't buy it.  But I'm glad that I did rent it as I did enjoy the film.

B003Y5H4YI|3.0|The Debt is a spy-thriller that focuses more on character development than action.  The time is 1965.  Three Israeli Mossad agents are tasked with capturing the Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel, also known as \\"the Surgeon of Birkenau,\\" and bringing him from East Berlin to Israel to stand trial for atrocities committed against the Jewish people.  Things do not go as planned, however, and the agents must improvise.  The movie alternates between the mission in 1965 and the aftermath in 1997, when the three are now old and famous, but bear a terrible secret.  Will they tell the truth or continue to perpetuate a lie?<br /><br />The acting is strong (particularly Helen Mirren as old Rachel and Jessica Chastain as young Rachel), and the directing is tight, maintaining suspense till the end.  The blu-ray transfer is great--both audio and visuals are what one would expect from a recent release.  The bonus features include the typical director's commentary and making-of documentaries.<br /><br />Parental advisory: The Debt contains some language and violence, including discussions of Holocaust atrocities.  While there is no nudity, there is implied sex and three uncomfortable-to-watch gynecological examinations with reproduction-related dialogue.  This is not a movie for pre-teens.<br /><br />I recommend The Debt.  It does not have the flash of a Jason Bourne movie, but is more realistic.  The agents, while skilled and physically fit, are nevertheless flesh and blood people with emotions.  It is worth seeing.
B007CM9AMI|4.0|This is pure, vintage Bruce Springsteen---but Springsteen with the wisdom and temperament of senior citizenship. It's a gritty, old styled rock 'n roll libretto carrying an unmistakable, but muted critique of American plutocracy.<br />The songs strike repeatedly upon the nostalgic chords of a long-gone industrial memory. The lyrics unfurl with muffled outrage over social hypocrisy and working class exploitation...as newborn wraiths of contemporary disaster, in the form of the recent economic meltdown, haunt the album.<br />Springsteen's music has always been heavy on the drums, base runs and his signature elided, gravel-voiced rock-lyrics...and \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is no exception. It is a creature of that same creative working class muse. It's also heavy on the unstated but implicit condemnation of those responsible for the loss of our great national industrial spinal column and the erosion of the \\"social contract\\" of the 1940's, a covenant that built America's middle class. The name of the album is clearly metaphorical...America's great economic beating heart has mutated into a \\"wrecking ball\\" and Bruce wants to sing about it.<br />In short, Bruce is older but all there. Solid. Unwavering. Vintage Bruce Springsteen...working class hero, rock-auteur. I love it.

B000ICXQGK|4.0|Apparently when What Dreams May Come was initially presented in theaters my parents walked out.  My brother was down on the movie, he heard it was bad...  com'on, any move with Robin Williams is worth watching! Especially with Cuba Gooding, Jr...  Surely it wasn't their best movie but if you give it time (until the very end) it is a worthwhile movie on an otherwise uneventful evening.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I think Richard Dawkins has really spoken from the heart and told us what he really thinks about God here. You may read this book and still believe in God when you though. He leaves open the possibility that there might be a God but states his scientific reasons for not believing in God. If you want to broaden your point of view you should read this book.
B008RTE08E|4.0|For anyone with an open mind and an appreciation for the Beatles or the experimentation so much a part of the 1960s, Magical Mystery Tour is a fun almost-hour's trip. You'll learn exactly what a mystery tour is, then embark on one, experiencing humorous moments, out there moments, and of course some very nice musical scenes. The DVD release looks and sounds great and includes nearly an hour's worth of extras. I certainly don't regret my purchase!

The secondary characters were especially difficult to read about (the teenage girls and the group of women in their 40's/50's) I was pulled (jarred) out of the story so many times I gave up more than once.

B00A0JBYRE|4.0|The sherlock genre is so overdone that i thought there was no chance i would watch this show.  however, that was before i reckoned on johnny lee miller as sherlock. i think what is really working here is that this is the first time that someone has been cast as sherlock who is actually very appealing to women. this is of course deviating substantially from the arthur conan doyle sherlock, or so one would think.  because somehow miller otherwise remains very true to the sherlock on the page.  i have never seen this mix before. miller is much more versatile than i originally supposed.  he was anything but attractive playing the villain on dexter a few seasons ago.  he was quite good as a villain and not at all appealing.<br /><br />the show is clever too.  the scene pictured is sherlock working on corpses in the morgue for his equivalent of a body farm like lab exercise.  he is trying various killing maneuvers on the corpses.<br /><br />lucy liu is working as watson and i think the main reason she is is because the role is written and she is playing it very understated.  watson is always second banana to sherlock and any attempt to disrupt that would be disastrous.  but watson is also the voice of sanity when sherlock goes off the reservation.<br /><br />this episode involves exposing an angel of death in a hospital, who is killing terminal patients. there is an interesting twist to this episode which exposes another evildoer which is unexpected.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0097EWK3A|4.0|Lots of running back and forth. Worth the effort. Good story, lots of suspense, good graphics, and game play is good for the most part, though you may need the hint button occasionally. And, it is worth the price for the whole game.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is a wonderful, lyrical, moving story. It's a visual feast, from the elaborate sets to the way the camera moves us between scenes. All of the actors do remarkable work. And, at the end of the day, it's about misfits who somehow find a way to fit, to find love, to find acceptance, to find their way in a sometimes difficult and cruel world full of storms and full of bullies and full of rules. This is one of the best films I've ever seen, lovingly written, lovingly staged, lovingly acted.
B008RTE066|5.0|I love MMT; always have. I saw it on screen in my college days at one of those midnight showings at a local Jerry Lewis Cinema along with \\"Reefer Madness\\" and some other similarly-themed film epics that attracted the dazed fans. It is silly, fun, pointless, Python-like, and a real treat for Beatles fans. I never thought of it as a home movie as critics describe. It's more of a stream-of-consciousness effort created by some very rich and very high musicians who owned the world.<br />My sole gripe about the creation itself is that John Lennon appears to be sleep walking through most of the movie. Obviously bored, he seems to be there only out of obligation. His best scenes come when he injects a bit of the Lennon humor: shoveling spaghetti; falling over in the \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" ending; and talking to Nichola. Also, I think that's him selling Ringo the tour tickets at the beginning. At his best (\\"I am the Walrus\\")he is brilliant as Paul is in \\"Fool on the Hill.\\"In his later days, he said the film was Paul's project and he didn't have much to do with it because he was sick of being a Beatle. I think he was either too stoned, too lazy or both. Too bad. It was his chance to put his zany stamp on on something that has stood the test of time just like any of the Beatles' works.<br />George is George, relegated to one song. He too needed to be more in the forefront. Watch some of his later solo videos to see how talented a filmster he could be.<br />To me, Ringo and Paul make the show a delight. It's their interest and involvement that keep the magic in the tour.<br />As far as the packaging goes, where's the \\"Hello Goodbye\\" video? How about some more of the actual criticism at the time? In addition, this is obviously a blueprint for the future works of Monty Python. Why not put some of their comments in?<br />Even the printed material could have used more industry and historical perspective.<br />Still, I've watched it four times since I bought it four days ago. I particularly love Paul's commentary although he could have used a cup of expresso before he taped it.<br />(Next, chronologically, we should get \\"Let It Be.\\" But I guess that there's some difficulty with the music licensing as the band went through quite a few cover versions.)

B008AS5UAO|2.0|I fell for the hype.<br /><br />When Deutsche Grammophon announced this release in Summer 2012, I looked forward to a sleek, slick, modern performance with outstanding singing, playing, and conducting. Perhaps, too, I was swayed by the presence on the podium of Yannick N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin, the young, exciting, incoming music director of my local band, the Philadelphia Orchestra.<br /><br />I could not have been more disappointed.<br /><br />The problems begin from the start. The first bars make it clear that this performance will be informed by the sound-worlds of the historically-informed performance (HIP) movement: a less weighty orchestral sound, restrained use of vibrato, and so on. Nor is this in itself a problem. Yet, once the conductor, ensemble, and producers have set this tone, I had imagined that they would stick with it.<br /><br />And it's when we hear the voices that the problems become evident: they are too big for this conception. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo may be one of the great Don Giovannis of this generation, but on this recording, he overpowers his Leporello, Luca Pisaroni. I hear a Don Giovanni who is mean, cynical, and brutal, to whom a buffo counterweighto seems ineffective and, at the end of the day, not even very funny. Similarly, Joyce DiDonato's Donna Elvira is marred by her vibrato, which I find almost unlistenable, but which, at a minimum, obscures those hints of gullibility and naivet&eacute; that, early on in the opera, seems to be an integral aspect of her character.<br /><br />Still, the most serious problems are on the podium. N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin's conducting, rather than in assisting to move the drama forward, frequently bogs it down. I had the sense that his approach was not well thought out and that he needed to live with the piece for much longer before committing it to record. Time will almost certainly give him the opportunity to refine his conception, to synthesize the practices of HIP with the capabilities of voices suited to a big house like the Met.<br /><br />In the meantime, I recommend that listeners look to the recordings by Ren&eacute; Jacobs and Nikolaus Harnoncourt to hear two of the best representations of this work as heard through two of the leading of the practitioners of HIP, the former on eighteenth-century instruments, the latter with the (modern) Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. And listeners interested in an older tradition can always turn to recordings by Busch, Furtw&auml;ngler, Friscay, and Giulini.

1401207529|5.0|Somewhere along the east coast of the United States, lies a major metropolitan area known as Gotham City. From the outside, it looks like a peaceful and prosperous city, but below the surface, it is a crime-ridden hell-hold of greed, corruption, graft, sin, and villainy. Viscous crime lords like Carmine &#34;The Roman&#34; Falcone, and Sal &#34;The Boss&#34; Maroni have an iron grip on the city's economy and politics. Even Gotham's finest are no strangers to corruption. Cops like Detective Flass and Commissioner Loeb are being paid off by the mob, and in return give them protection. It's almost as if there is no hope for Gotham City. No hope except for.... THE BATMAN!!!<br /><br />BATMAN: YEAR ONE is the ultimate retelling of Batman's origin! It defines who Batman is, how he came to be, and what he fights against like never before! Frank Miller (author of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, SIN CITY, and 300) builds up on the original two-page origin story created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger in 1939, and redefines it for a modern generation! We get to see how corrupted Gotham is from the view points of both Jim Gordon and Batman. Jim Gordon is a young police officer that has just moved to Gotham City from Chicago, with his pregnant wife Barbra. After joining the GCPD, Gordon is assigned as a lieutenant to Detective Flass' unit. Immediately Gordon sees how low the police department has fallen. He witnesses Flass taking bribes from drug dealers and learns that Commissioner Loeb is a personal friend of crime lords like &#34;The Roman.&#34; The stress of cleaning up the police department, along with trying to support and protect his pregnant wife from harm, leads Lt. Gordon to carrying the burden of a dark secret from everyone else.<br /><br />In Batman's point of view, his alter-ego Bruce Wayne has returned to Gotham City after a 12 year long absence. He is now fully trained, and ready to take on the scum of Gotham. However, he still lacks one crucial element: the power to install fear in his enemies. He realizes this on his first night of crime fighting, when he is brutally beaten by a gang of prostitutes, and shot by the police. He is able to escape back to Wayne Manor before he succumbs to his injuries. As he is trying to figure out how to scare his enemies, a bat comes crashing through his window. Knowing that bats frightened him when he was a boy, he decides to take up the mantle of a bat to turn his fear as a weapon against his enemies. It was only after that night, that he truly became the Batman. The dark and menacing figure of the night, who uses fear against those who prey on the fearful.<br /><br />Frank Miller uses both viewpoints to create the sensational story of Batman's first year of crime fighting. He tells us not just of how Bruce Wayne became Batman, but also of how he introduced into the setting of Gotham. He is not the legendary crime fighter that he is today. He is still inexperienced, vulnerable to injury, distrusted by the police, and is continuously building his way up from a novice crime fighter, to the dark knight. Miller also expands Jim Gordon's role in the Batman universe. In earlier comics he was thought of as an ordinary and elderly police commissioner who simply was allies with Batman, because he helped bring in criminals. But Frank Miller gives us a completely different outtake on Gordon. That he is an average man who has devoted himself to cleaning up the corruption in not only Gotham City, but in the police department as well. He does not fully support Batman's methods, but allows him to carry on his vigilante activities because of the good he does for Gotham. Frank Miller created the Commissioner Gordon that we know today.<br /><br />It is a truly remarkable story that only the genius behind THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, could've created. Miller breaks the chains of Batman's original origin story, and gives us a realistic story of two men's crusade on saving their city from corruption. A story that would change Batman's world forever, and inspire the film BATMAN BEGINS. You can never call yourself a Batman fan without reading the legendary BATMAN: YEAR ONE!he film BATMAN BEGINS. You can never call yourself a Batman fan without reading the legendary BATMAN: YEAR ONE!

B0036SSZIC|4.0|In this documentary Moore investigates how default swaps and other useless financial products caused the 2008 financial collapse and subsequent bailout.  He shows us how backroom deals at the capitol pushed a bailout that most citizens didn't want.<br /><br />  He also shows how creepy corporations can be. For instance they take out life insurance on employees -- not their executives -- regular hourly workers.  When the employee dies and the families are struggling just to pay funeral expenses the corporations cash in.  After this story Wal-Mart discontinued this policy.<br /><br />  This is the third Michael Moore film I've seen.  I loved them all.  I've also watched some documentaries that attack Moore's movies.  While they have some valid points to consider they fail to produce any satisfactory evidence that any of Moore's stories are false.  They were so boring I can't remember their names.  Moore's movies are entertaining and informative.

B0096PAA6E|3.0|I am at odds here.  Gary is a phenomenal guitarist and singer.  George Benson is the same way, although different in what he has to say and how to say it.  When I purchase a George Benson, I can pick and choose what album to buy based on what style the album is in.  If it's straight out Jazz jams ala Freddie Hubbard era, I know it and the album is consistent.  I avoid what I don't like.  Not so with Gary Clark Jr.  He puts several forms of music expression on an album, and while all are very well done and excellent musically, I don't want to listen to them.  This format ruins the album as a whole.  When you have a guitar god song like \\"When My Train Pulls In\\" (which should go down as one of the greatest guitar songs of all time.  It really is powerful) backed by the title track \\"Blak and Blu\\", with all of its Hip Hop, smooth listening atmosphere, the moment becomes lost.  And this occurs over and over again on the album.  It's very disconerting and puts off would be fans.  I appreciate what Gary is trying to do, but I do not believe it will work.  Albums need to be a whole, not a hodge podge of your skills in various formats.  You could say, \\"He's being true to himself as an artist.\\"  But, as an artist, I can say that your label is made by being excellent at one thing.  I bought an album that has 13 talented songs, but only about 5 that I will listen to, and one of those has been on all three of his releases.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I love john grisham`s books. However I have noticed some changes in his writing. Its much slower delivery and more focused on innocent prisoners or guilty conscience ( which is nothing wrong) but its repeated in almost every novel he writes these days.

B0060FXBNM|3.0|Okay, seriously, this has to stop. This \\"movie set\\" is ONLY that. The barest of bare releases of all 3 movies. No special features to speak of. Okay, in theory there's a commentary track on disc one and maybe some trailers available after film? But that's about it.<br /><br />Considering I already had the SE DVD versions, I consider this set to be an utter and complete RIPOFF. There, I said it.<br /><br />BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE until the studio(s) gets the message. We hate it when they half-ass releases and we hate being double dipped. If I'm spending beaucoup $$ to get a COMPLETE set, I want the set to be COMPLETE, not to have to REPURCHASE it again in 6 mos when the get off their handquarters and finally decide to release the ACTUAL complete series set they should have released the first time around. Clearly, SE Blu-Rays exist for [[ASIN:B000NTPDT6 Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition + BD Live)]] & [[ASIN:B001KZIRM2 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], though they've also admittedly to-date half-assed [[ASIN:B005G4TJI4 Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]] by releasing it \\"bare\\" w/o special features (in yet another attempt at double dipping 'early adopters' by making them repurchase later if they want all the extras).<br /><br />As a fan, and as a collector of movies, I find this thoroughly distasteful.<br /><br />I had precisely the same problem with the release of the [[ASIN:B000UR9T82 Spider-Man: High Definition Trilogy]] set, where the \\"upgrade\\" to Blu-Ray was actually a \\"downgrade\\" to zero special features (despite having already bought all the SE DVDs). That the studios DECIDED to include only the bare version of the first two movies and the SE of the 3rd didn't speak well of that set either.<br /><br />On the other hand, the [[ASIN:B000OPPBEQ The Ultimate Matrix Collection]], [[ASIN:B00938UVC2 Terminator Anthology]], [[ASIN:B008J56GVU The Resident Evil Collection]], [[ASIN:B007FFUMKQ Underworld: The Legacy Collection]], [[ASIN:B004GSVX5S Riddick Collection]] and [[ASIN:B001EN71HC Austin Powers Collection]] were how \\"complete collections\\" SHOULD be released... All were quite good & feature complete!<br /><br />As fans and collectors, we expect more of studios. That is to say, if a SE has already been put out, the \\"features\\" from the SE should make it into the \\"collection\\" set(s) rather than being completely left out. Either that or they should be EXTREMELY CLEAR that they are releasing \\"bare\\" / \\"movie-only\\" editions and will be releasing \\"ultimate\\" editions later. Yes, they'll score fewer sales up front by labeling as \\"movie-only\\" editions. But, that's AS IT SHOULD BE. Those who WANT FEATURES will be [somewhat] happier knowing exactly what they WON'T be getting so they can avoid sub-par releases and hold out for \\"complete\\" releases rather than buying the \\"set\\" only to find out upon getting it home that it's completely not even close to what they were expecting.<br /><br />So, I'll simply say of this set: the picture and sound are great. The features... WHAT FEATURES? Effectively, there are none... If you've already bought the special edition DVDs or Blu, don't both with this set. Avoid it. Wait for the \\"ultimate edition\\" that will no doubt come out later. Thus avoid being double and triple dipped... (We're not ice cream cones. We're fans and collectors and we expect better treatment...) So, 3 points for video & sound, docked 2 points for complete lack of features.<br /><br />All that said, there was apparently once a Transformers Limited Edition Collector's Trilogy. However, the LE packaging looked a bit unwieldy and it appears to now be discontinued w/o a replacement as yet.<br /><br />I'd suggest waiting for a \\"repack\\" of that set (likely in a more standard case, just with the same \\"SE\\" discs)...<br /><br />Until then, caveat emptor.

1439152802|5.0|This is an incredible story filled with intrigue.  Off you go down a road that looks straight and narrow only to find the road is curvy, filled with surprisingly sharp corners and utterly irresistible characters.  Up until the very final paragraph you are surprised.  The author awed me with unimaginable talent telling an intricate story that wove together stories of past and present as well as mystery, love, history, bravery and loyalty.  Wonderful story.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|This series is everything you could ever want about Rome, intrigue, action, and blood - with copius amounts of adult content. The quality is that of a well-made movie, not a TV series. The writing is surprisingly excellent.
B0063IH60K|4.0|User friendly with several options to make play interesting. l never have to worry about lost cards or messy piles again.
B004JMY312|4.0|A cute Halloween movie for the family. We stream this through our game system without any problems. I have even in the past purchased and downloaded movies without any problems. I enjoy the fact that through Amazon I can watch new releases as well as oldies without having to leave the house.
B001IF252M|5.0|Apple products by Apple/3rd party are all expensive but elegant devices. This has worked very well as most of monitors I have are still VGA. Cannot go wrong with these devices. Very easy to connect at either end.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I don't understand why there are only 36 sounds when it says in the screen shot that there are 82. Can someone please explain to me why I am not getting the right amount?
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Searching for the origin of Mankind is a compelling story-line, and people will watch it just for that, but this movie fails on every other level. It borrows, poorly, from many sci-fi movies and offers nothing original. The complicated, exotic looking two-hand flame guns are less impressive than a can of hair-spray and a Bic lighter, and the movie is filled with lame effects such as that. Maybe the cliches will make it a cult film just for the silliness. If it were a book, no one would read it, there is no plot or imagination, and I wouldn't even call it sci-fi, it's just ridiculous low-budget fantasy.
B000002URV|5.0|I bought this originally after having heard about it's release from my brother in the U.K.  The Gregorian chant in the background seemed like a whole new idea back then and I found it thrilling and haunting not to mention erotic coupled with the sound and feel of Sade. I'm sure that I was not the only person who's ears and hair stood to attention listening to it!!  I lost the original copy or gave it away over the years and have now bought it again through Amazon.  I feel like I'm hearing it again for the first time!  Sultry!!

B009DJB9HC|5.0|Get's better with each listen, it really does.  While there is no hit between the eyes number like Man in the Middle off of BCC 2, this album just has a certain flow and rhythm of old school rock and roll.  There is more keyboard and guitar jamming on this album than the other 2 previous efforts, and while JB's vocal contribution is less here, him and Glenn trades off marvelously on Cry Freedom, probably their best song they've sung together.  Everyone again has put their best foot forward with this release, and it shows...Afterglow, with time, could be the band's best work yet.  Dispite all the recent shenanigans in the news between Joe and Glenn, look for these guys to work together again, this is too good and too important for anyone to close the door on.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|I always look forward to the new Patricia Cornwell Kay Scarpetta novels and this one does not disappoint.  It kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through and as always she is well researched on the subject.<br />I enjoyed it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I have mixed emotions about this book.  I do not feel it has the quality of writing that I enjoyed in the Potter series. I found it to be very dark, almost depressing.  It was also very \\"English.\\"  Had I not read a number and variety of English novels in the past I would not have understood some of it. It didn't necessarily relate to American life.<br /><br />I would only recommend it with reservations.  In fact, that it exactly how it was recommended to me.
0694013013|5.0|This was first read to us at a mommy and me class, the book was much larger and was a board book, I didn't check the dimensions first (this books is smaller than I thought) but we love the book. My son does everything the characters do, it was a wonderful surprise. I would recommend a bigger book though.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great read . I could not put the book down. It's to bad many of the operational details could not be revealed due to having to protect oneself from Obama.it gives a great perspective on how little Obama knows about Spec war. It also describes that if your Obama its ok to reveal classified information and potentially endanger our seal heroes.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I recieved the CD before the promised date so I was very happy about that.  And listening to Alison Krauss and Union Station is great but I had no idea that the life performance would be just as rich and clear. I'm really enjoying the songs-- which are a great mix of songs with lyrics and great bluegrass instrumentals. There's also a great bit of commentary in between songs from Ms. Krauss or the audience.  It's almost like being there.

1469984202|5.0|I enjoyed all of these stories, although I felt the last one dragged a little bit. Overall this author has a very elegant, succinct style of writing, which I really appreciate. I found parts of it to be very amusing, especially when the protagonist was revealed. I found the storyline to be very unique and I hope to read more stories by this author. I highly recommend these stories and I agree with the previous reviewer that said they are destined to be a sci-fi classic.
B007FSF1FE|5.0|Extraordinary album!Great mixture of styles and great band!The whole album this one to the height.Dr.John is a artist very interesting
B009NPKTN6|1.0|As a huge fan of the Broadway musical I had no idea what to expect when I watched this movie. I tried hard to keep an open mind. Sadly, I was hugely disappointed. The stage show was edgy, hilarious, and loaded with great tunes well-performed by a superbly talented cast. At its heart was the engaging love story between its two not-quite-so squeaky clean protagonists, Drew and Sherrie, which has some bumps along the way but ends happily (hey, it's a musical, right?)and keeps you entertained all the way to the end. You genuinely cared about the characters and what they go through during the course of the story. Unfortunately,  \\"Rock of Ages\\" the movie bears little relation to the delightful musical that garnered five Tony nominations. It has been gutted of all of its heart and emotion and what is left is a big empty shell in which dull minor characters are now the main focus and allowed to preen and strut at the expense of plot and character development. And humor and musical talent. I guess that's what happens when you feel you have to pad a picture with big names; Adam Shankman must have felt he needed to give them more screen time and thus sacrificed the story along the way. Stacee Jaxx, the character portrayed by Tom Cruise, was but a minor but pivotal character in the musical, but is now inexplicably thrust into center stage and has way too much screen time. Every time he was on screen I was bored out of my mind. He wasn't funny, his character was not interesting, and I found myself repeatedly looking at my watch waiting for the torture to end. If you have to bring in a monkey to try and add laughs you know you are in deep trouble.  Evidently to make room for so much Cruise screen time, Drew and Sherrie have been reduced to Disneyfied cutesy teens hanging around in the background, with no chemistry or talent in a love story that is now also equally uninteresting. The pivotal moment in the musical where their relationship has a significant turning point has been completely altered, into nonsense that the audience really couldn't care less about. Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin were also completely unfunny and their attempts at singing downright painful. Interestingly enough I found the most interesting role and best performance came from Catherine Zeta-Jones as the Christian rock music protestor, in a role that didn't exist in the stage play. She was funny and performed her role with an energy and gusto sorely lacking from the rest of the cast. It was a thrill to witness the delightful cameo by Constantine Maroulis, who had given such a terrific performance as Drew in the Broadway show. It's a good thing after all that he didn't get cast as Drew in this sorry excuse for a movie musical. I apologize for continuously referencing the musical but it just amazes me how such a wonderful Broadway show could be transformed into this dull, unfunny, uninteresting cinematic disaster that bears little relation to it. Don't waste your time on this movie. Go see the live musical!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Hollywood has no business making movies out of broadway plays, they ruin them.  Thankfully, the 25th Anniversary of Phanthom of the Opera at Alpert Hall simply puts the cameras focusing on the actual stage production.  There are no gimmicks, no CGI, and no film special effects.  What transpires in front of you is only the talents of the actors, the director, the set designer and the orchestra.  This movie is magic...simply the best production of Phanthom of the Opera I have ever seen (and I've seen many).  I have already watched this DVD six times, and I'm sure I will watch many, many more.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fiofty Shades of Grey is the most romantic, erotic, love story I have ever read. The story grabs you and pulls you into its life and you become part of it. The second and third book are, if believeable, even better than the first book. I only wish there were more books than justI the trilogy. I applaud E. l. James on her books and hope to read more of her work in the future.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library because it was on the best seller list for weeks.  I waited a long time to get it but it was worth the wait.  I really enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down.<br />The story is written in the 1st person from the point of view of Andy Barber, the father of 14 yr. old Jacob accused murdering a classmate from his middle school.  Andy also happens to be the assistant DA and originally is preparing to be the prosecutor.  It starts with him being questioned by an assistant DA (who he trained) for a grand jury.  It is a little confusing as the reader doesn't know why Andy is being questioned, but that confusion is forgotten as the story gets very enthralling.  Andy refuses to believe Jacob could be a murderer, it is just not possible.<br /><br />I really was rooting for Andy even though I thought the son was the murderer.  As a parent, you never want to think the worst of your child.  You felt his confusion as to why his wife wasn't as convinced as he was.  I refuse to spoil the story but if you like a mystery, this is one to read.  The ending was great.  If I had to think of a book it reminded me of, I'd say \\"Presumed Innocent\\" but much easier to read and get into.
B009POCG2C|3.0|Trouble With The Curve is a watchable film about an aging baseball scout facing problems with a changing game, fading eyesight and a difficult relationship with his daughter that he's running out of time to fix. In a lot of ways, it could have been the perfect counter-point to last year's excellent film Moneyball, showing the view of the veteran scouts and their traditional ways of looking for talent in contrast to the analytics-driven approach which now dominates the game. But in the hands of first-time director Robert Lorenz and first-time screen-writer Randy Brown, Trouble With The Curve never ventures beyond formula and manages to run for 111 mostly by-the-numbers minutes without a single moment of unpredictability.<br /><br />Gus Lobel (Clint Eastwood) is a man caught between the rocks of old age and failing eyesight and the hard place of trying to hang on to his job as a baseball scout as the whole nature of the business is changing around him, going from a hands-on gut feel approach to boiling down potential players into a set of stats on a laptop. His contract with the Atlanta Braves baseball team is coming up for renewal, but his bosses, team owner Vince (Robert Patrick) and manager Pete Klein (John Goodman) aren't sure if Gus is up to the job anymore. Especially with their up-and-coming scout Phil Sanderson (Matthew Lillard, oozing sleaze) telling them that Gus' way of doing things just doesn't cut it anymore.<br /><br />Ultimately, everything depends on a scouting mission Gus is set to handle: to check out a player named Bo Gentry (Joe Massingill, oozing obnoxiousness), a hard-hitter on a small Georgia college team who's viewed as a potential top pick in the upcoming draft. Klein, who's a long-time friend of Gus's as well as his boss, gets in touch with Gus's daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams, shining brilliantly) a successful attorney on the brink of being made a partner at the law firm where she works. Klein tells Mickey his concerns and what's at stake for Gus if he blows this mission, asking her to go with Gus and keep an eye on things. Unwilling at first, particularly as her being made a partner depends on a big presentation she's to give for a major client in a matter of days, Mickey reluctantly gives in when she finds out about Gus's eye problems, telling her bosses that she has to take a couple of days off to deal with her father but that she _will_ be there to handle the presentation on time. While Mickey and Gus aren't exactly estranged, there is nonetheless a distance between them that neither seems able to overcome, making their relationship difficult at best and more often one of walking away with hands thrown up in frustration. Their only common ground, rather naturally given the film, is their love of baseball.<br /><br />While scouting out the intended prospect, Gus and Mickey run into Johnny (Justin Timberlake), a former pitcher first recruited by Gus who is now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, having been forced to find an alternate career after his arm gave out too soon. Johnny rounds out the odd trio, Johnny in his relationship to Gus as a former recruit and now rival scout, Gus with his awkward and ever frictional relationship with Mickey, and now Mickey who finds herself being drawn out in spite of herself by Johnny's almost clownish come-on's. And of course all three of them with their relationship with baseball, the one thing where they all find their moments of grace.<br /><br />It has to be said that if Trouble With The Curve works at all, it is in no small part because of Amy Adams' performance. In spite of Lorenz' mechanical direction and Brown's pedestrian script, Adams manages to make Mickey shine nonetheless, engaging you in ways that make you buy into her character even when you'd otherwise see no reason to. Some of her best moments are those in which she has no dialogue and it's just the expression on her face conveying what Mickey is feeling that make the connection. Her scenes with Eastwood and with Timberlake work because she makes them work, bringing a chemistry to the situations that keeps you watching and makes you care. Eastwood's Gus is adequate to the role, but only just, with Eastwood basically just playing the same role he's been playing for the last twenty years, largely glaring and growling his way through things, mostly relying in this case on the fact that at 82 he actually _is_ old instead of having to act old. In the hands of a better director, Eastwood would almost certainly have given a better performance, but one of the problems with Trouble With The Curve is that Lorenz doesn't seem to know how to draw the best out of his actors or the situations they're in. Timberlake is not only largely wasted but in retrospect grossly miscast: he would have been far more effective as Gus's in-house nemesis Sanderson. As Johnny, he really doesn't have much credibility or even reason to be there as you could pretty much cut all of his scenes and it wouldn't affect the main plot in the slightest. But at the same time, his scenes with Adams do give her even more opportunities to shine. One of my favorite scenes is in a country bar where Mickey pulls a reluctant Johnny out onto the dance floor for a throw-him-in-the-water lesson in clog-dancing.<br /><br />The other performances are a mixed bag, but two in particular stand out in ways that encapsulate the problems with the script and the direction. Matthew Lillard's Phil is almost a caricature of a sleazey underhanded in-house rival to Gus, so over-the-top that you know from the moment he first opens his mouth that you're supposed to hate him. I think this could be something of a career problem for Lillard as he's gone from always playing goofy comic sidekicks when he was younger to now playing complete sleazeballs in recent years, most recently in The Descendants. And Joe Massingill's Bo Gentry is so unbelievably obnoxious that it's a mystery why the rest of his team hasn't taken him out behind the stadium and beaten him to death with his own bat long before Gus and Mickey show up. If Trouble With The Curve had been an outright comedy, then both Lillard and Massingill's performances would've fit perfectly, but as it is, some subtlety was badly needed and unfortunately was completely lacking, the primary blame for which must be laid at the feet of Lorenz and Brown.<br /><br />One wishes that Lorenz and Brown had been more daring or ambitious, given the talented actors they had to work with, but they weren't. You can tell early on that before Trouble With The Curve is over, all problems will be resolved in true Hollywood fashion, the characters you like will all triumph in the end and the characters you dislike will all get their deserved comeuppance. One also wishes that they'd gotten a more experienced director and writer to begin with as quite frankly Lorenz and Brown display a lack of talent in both the direction and the writing. The one element of mystery in the film - the reason why Gus and Mickey have such distance between them - when finally revealed feels completely artificial due in part to the clunky way in which the foreshadowing was handled and in part to the fact that, once revealed, it apparently makes no difference to either character as the movie just returns to its original track. The editing is often jumpy in places instead of smooth, and apparently Lorenz never wanted to do more than one take because you're constantly seeing all of the major actors' eyes looking to the sides, apparently to read cue cards to get through their lines. A regrettable waste of A-list actors in the C-list hands of a first-time director and a first-time writer.<br /><br />On the plus side, the feel of the settings is well done, and you can believe that you're actually seeing Gus and Mickey doing a scouting mission in a small town where a local baseball star can be a big fish in a small pond. The music score by Marco Beltrami is also well done, setting the tone in the background without ever being intrusive so that you're barely aware that it's there, exactly the kind of score you need in a film like this.<br /><br />Recommended for Amy Adams' brilliant performance and for anyone interested in a film about baseball recruiting and doesn't mind if the rest of the film is routine and completely predictable.stadium and beaten him to death with his own bat long before Gus and Mickey show up.

B002BY77CW|5.0|This book/series is one of the best I have read in a long time. I love Lauren Conrad and the way she writes. Its not what I usually read but I am so glad I took the risk. AMAZING!! You won't be able to put it down!

I thought the murder plot was very good and would recommend this book for an easy read.
B009ZQAN9I|3.0|He is seriously scaring the sh!t out of me. Jessica Lange's performance in this episode is flat out amazing. Watching her play this character is probably the only reason I'll stick around for the rest of the season. I just can't get in to the bloody face, aliens, mutants-in-the-woods, exorcist stuff. Somebody just kill Adam Levine, already. Also, I GET IT RYAN MURPHY, Catholics are bad and you are scared of vaginas.

0670022411|5.0|I loved this book so completely.  I did not get completely sucked into the story until the second chapter but from that point forward I couldn't put it down.  I was prepared with the second book as soon as I finished.  The only drawback is that the third has no publication date!
B0090O07S2|5.0|I finally watched this new version and recently saw the one with a complaint of old version and must say that even if it has been altered in some formatting that hardly a real issue to how the whole video done. A much better print then the original DVD that was out. How they made the lost tracks fit was a marvel. It almost seems to me they used the Hollywood Bowl audio from the tapes they got from \\"Absolutely Live\\" but states otherwise, nevertheless, this one is worth picking up if your just wondering what The Doors were like \\"Live\\" or the collector wanting a better complete concert. The bonus material with members are really good as well. A history of the Bowl (which I have been to and it is a great venue for a concert) & the way the added songs were put into the DVD. So in conclusion, get this one, keep the other if you want to which they cut out the fireworks in this version & enjoy The Doors in the peak of their career. Highly recommended, get it!<br />Drop by my website sometime at \\"JudeMac Forever\\".

0143143492|5.0|This book explained to me how it is possible to go to bed in the world and wake up in heaven.  Changes in awareness happen all at once, or so it seems to me, but our understanding of what 'just happened' takes place over years and years.  Those years are filled with guilt, regret, joy and pain--they amount to growth.  However, that actual growth took place almost instantaneously.  Perhaps that time between the occurrence of change and the understanding of that change can be better used than by suffering after the fact.  This book promotes and facilitates new awareness as a means of decreasing suffering for the individual and the society he or she inhabits.  Great read.  I've sent copies to at least five friends.  Got it on audio book and have gone back and read the book.  I like the audio book with Tolle reading his work to me.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I really love this book. This book kept my rivited and wanted more. I really couldn't wait to get the next two books.
B0027UY8B8|3.0|Just know that the embedded BR program does not allow you to watch all episodes in a raw without expressly choosing this option so if you start watching form another episode than the first one on each disc, then you'll have to go back to the main menu each time you want to go to next episode. It doesn't comply with the feature that usually allows your player to memorize the last reading position so if you stop your BR player in the middle of an episode, you'll have to go through the disclaimers and federal warning messages (and the producer stupid message about this new edition) again and restart from the beginning the episode you were watching. Another thing : They put some extended versions of some episodes. But, for some odd reason, these extended versions are always on the next disc so you'll always find this out after watching the original version... this is really, completely stupid.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|Should be mandatory reading in highschool. While you may not agree with all conclusions in this book you owe yourself the reflection it imposes on you!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I was told the book is written by sort of a desperate housewife. Actually, I don't mind. Equal rights, remember? Recently, I read something interesting on a website dedicated to relationship phycology. It said, \\"To become truly happy a woman, however paradoxically it may seem, should subdue one's personality and submit to a man's will, she should be weak for her man and that will make her stronger and her remuneration will be unmeasurable\\". The book is a perfect illustration to the quote. We live in a strange world where our imminent phycological traits are in a constant clash with newly invented social norms and imposed stereotypes. Hence the conflict: what a woman in the 19th century would find normal her 21st century sister finds difficult to put up with... To summarize, I did not feel nauseous reading it like I used to be reading \\"Emmanuelle\\" in high school. (It became known in my country about 20 years later than in the rest of the world). I do not judge the book's text qualities. It is a book written by a woman for women. No man's territory.
B00445JSWS|5.0|what do you think--- greatest band ever in the history this or any world - but that's my opinion and it should be yours!
B006UREQ3Y|4.0|If you realy like Slash's stile you can't go wrong bying this DVD Made in Stoke. He was playing a lot on this DVD and the vocals are much better then his old band Guns and roses.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|Fun game. Challenging enough to stay interesting. You must reach a higher score at each level to unlock the next level. There are three games. The first, you have a time limit to reach the required score. The second,you get nine shots and after each shot the wind speed increases and the distance increases. The third, you get five balls to reach the required score.
0788859544|5.0|Very quick, loved the extra details the seller added to the shipping packaging! Would buy from them again!! The movie was just as I remembered from when I was little and it first came out!! Cant wait to share it with others!
B000002KIE|5.0|I usually don't listen to punk. But when i do, i wanna make sure the bands are from Europe. Let's be honest here : American punk is wrong. They never got it. From Dead Kennedys to Green Day...is just wrong.<br />This Sex Pistols album , which is also their only album...how brilliant is that to make history with one album ? This is the real deal. Musically the album is not brilliant, but i think that is what makes it ...brilliant. Johnny voice blends perfectly with the guitar and sometimes i'm thinking if Johnny was really serious about his singing or he was just playing dumb and really wanted to sound so...bad and brilliant at the same time.<br />I'm not gonna go into lyrics. But you have to realize what guts these guys had to sing about in 1979. In Europe.<br />I really don't know what to say about this. Is so bad but is the best thing i ever heard ( i'm talking about this specific genre). At the end all i have to say is that i love it.
B008PWUWLC|5.0|I love my Kindle Fire and this case makes it even better.  I've owned several cases for my Fire, but this is by far the best look and functionality.  This case actually allows the Fire to stand alone securely.  I've owned other \\"stand up\\" cases that felt flimsy and didn't do a good job of stand alone for watching movies on the Fire.  It fits well...nice and secure - not too tight or too loose.  I love the variety of styles available for the Fire and I love the fit and usefulness.  I don't think there is a better case out there for a combo of style and stand up ability.  You'll love this case!
B005FLX1HS|1.0|I got this CD from a friend as a gift. I have to be thankful for that but let's keep it about music.<br />I grew up listening to all types of music. Electronic as well. The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, Orbital, Crystal Method and Lunatic Calm just to name some of them.<br />I don't dig this. Is nothing but noise and some beat drops that i already heard them back in the 90's. They just came out with a new name , calling this ''dubstep'', but is really nothing new. This is just a repetition. The beats as well, the whole thing. And on top of that is missing the essential : the creativity.<br />Yes i can still headbang to electronic music, but i don't want to listen to this cd ever again. I gave it already 10 chances and i had enough.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Disappointed  because The Panther was Not a page turner like all other DeMille books until 3/4 of way through the story.
B004YD1KTO|5.0|This is the second book I have read by this author and AFTERWARDS was another very good story.  I enjoyed the narrative style from the two main characters done as an out of body view of the other characters and additional intrigue and information given in this way.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this story, a range of twists and turns that appeal to the part of me that likes a bit of a thriller.  The characters are real and display all the typical frailities and aspects of family, friendship and sometimes suffering.<br /><br />A great book to sit with an escape to.  I found it easy to read and hard to put away as the story kept me interested with each turn of the 'kindle'page.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|good app. fixed a lot of bugs. still slow and still freezes. sometimes doesn't recognize login information, have to enter multiple times.
0525952616|4.0|Steve<br /><br />Real enough to provoke some real thought on the topic of autonomous anonymous fighting machines while remaining a good ole fashion action-packed page turner.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|i really enjoyed the fast pace and descriptive writing. have used some pages with my high school reading class. will make great movie.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|amazing book. I love how poirot solves these challenging mysteries. He is able to find evidence that is out of the ordinary
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Such a Captivating read.. thoroughly enjoyed it.. can not wait to read the next one in the trilogy =-) .
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is amazing! It's got so many surprises in it! You don't ever want to put it down! It's also very interesting. It's a new world with different dialogue, setting, and people. Thomas, Gally, Chuck, and many others have many exciting adventures! I promise you this is one of the best books you can read if you like action, adventure, and mystery. I also suggest reading the Hunger Games Trilogy if you like this book. They are both really good! I pesonally love books like this. I'm sure that if you are an avid reader, then you will definitely love this. Even if you don't like to read for fun, this is a perfect book report book. I think anyone who CAN READ would enjoy this book. The Maze Runner is a great book about a different reality. Nobody could ever imagine a life that the Gladers live. You would never guess what happens to Thomas and what impact he has on all the other Gladers including the Newbie AFTER him. I'm not going to spoil anything else, but if you already like what you've heard, I suggest you buy this book imediately. If not, why not try it? I love this book and I think you would, too. Another book like this, the Hunger Games Trilogy, is very much like this. There is A LOT action and excitement in both books. I think everyone would enjoy this book, and the Hunger Games Trilogy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Too long to wait between books.Takes 6 hrs to read a book. Then you wait 6 months for the next one. Not into delayed gratification.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was a bit unsure if I wanted to read this book given all of the controversy.  However, I am glad I did.  Mark Owen did not reveal any new details that would put the SEALs in harms way as this was already done by the Obama administration.  Now I understand why the government did not want this published.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This book was a good book because the author didn't just let Percy find the rod and have a easy way to Olympus, unlike the movie. Percy had to search for the bolt, fight his way to Olympus. He battle multiple times which made the book very awesome.q
B0058EBNAO|1.0|What a waste of money. it seems that this is one of the only weather apps that costs money. at least whet I heard of. so why pay money for something you can get for and in HD? And on TV?
B008OOYALE|4.0|One of my favorites, but there is an bit of lag included. Sometimes when I try to mov something my screen goes blue. Takes a while to load sometimes but really other than that it is fabulous. I personally love only a few of these Story games and Dragon Story is one of them. Thanks TeamLava!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Never have an issue! I love this app. I like it better here than on  a computer.  Quick and easy.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I won this book in a giveaway as a gift and, I have to say, I'm now a Jamie McGuire fan.<br /><br />From a reader's perspective:<br />What a wonderful piece of writing. I found the story and the characters completely entrancing and the electric relationship between Travis and Abby kept me turning the page. Twists and turns throughout the novel left me wanting to keep it IN my hands. Ms. McGuire's plot was very well thought through and it was brought full circle in an eloquent way.<br /><br />From an editor's perspective:<br />What can I say other than, \\"WOW!\\" There were only a few errors throughout the entire book (as with ANY book on the market), descriptions were kept to a perfect level, pronouns were spot on, and there was zero head-hopping or confusing mix-ups of names.<br /><br />Now for my rating:<br />1 star for a most excellent story<br />1 star for believable characters I could identify with<br />1 star for surprises<br />1 star for editing<br />1 star for keeping me in distress until the end<br /><br />FIVE STARS FLAT.<br /><br />I'd give it TEN if I could.<br /><br />Rarely do I give this rating to a book that's not from one of my favorite authors. Jamie McGuire is on par with Fern Michaels in my eyes. I look forward to checking out more books by this author.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend you pick up a copy of this book.<br /><br />Personal note:<br />As I usually do, I read a few of the reviews before I began this novel. I feel the need to remind people: This is a work of fiction. Without at least one character with a problem (whether emotional or physical) the story doesn't work. Travis and Abby both undergo change from page one and that's the reason for a story to be told. If they were both perfect, there would be no point in the telling of a story. How fun is: Boy is ideal, girl is ideal, they fall in love and live happily ever after? It's boring.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This movie was enjoyable for adults or older teens, but also had many creepy and disturbing images, so I would definitely not let under 13 watch. Acting was great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I give this book 5 stars.I loved reading this book...very disappointed when I finished it.The way the story unfolded kept me hooked,unable to put it down.The twists and turns of the story are smart and give you hope for the survival of humanity.I have recommended this book to all my book loving friends. I look forward to more of Hugh Howies work.
B004X80QNG|5.0|This is finally my everyday app. i have also purxhased the online and ios companion apps. Kudos to the devs.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I love this show and I think it is awesome that I can get it on Amazon. One of the best shows I have ever seen.
B008NMT684|5.0|my little brother is three and love this app is awesome because little brother can play this app all time and I ask him if he wants a new app but he nevers yes because he has this app I rate this 5 stars because its fun and easy
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|Being a big fan of C.S. Forrester's \\"Hornblower' novels, I was pleased to find out that the Movie 'Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World' was actually culled from the Aubrey/Maturin series of books.  I'd never heard of them before.<br /><br />It's not an easy task to embark upon Book 1 of a series, knowing that there are about 20 to follow.  However, being as I've said a Horatio Hornblower devotee, I ploughed into 'Master and Commander' with a high level of anticipation.  Thus far I've not been disappointed - 2 weeks later I'm now reading 'HMS Surprise' (the 3rd of the series).<br /><br />The style is very different from Forrester.  There seems to be a lot less narrative as well, which is a bit of a pity, and the descriptions I sometimes find a bit overdone, by which I mean too intricately worked.  However, the attention to detail and the historical / naval research is first rate.  The characters are developed well and by the mid point you are getting a real feel for them.  I would like the naval actions to be described in a bit more detail, but I do like the way they have authentic language worked into them.  One would never have found some of the colorful language which I daresay was used in the navy during the Napoleonic wars in novels that were written at the time.  Jane Austen would swoon.<br /><br />Master and Commander is NOT the book from which the film was taken, though some lines of dialog are familiar.  However, I enjoyed it immensely and would give it 5 stars were it not for the points I've already made.  That said, I find the second book of the series to be better than the first, and the third better than the second, so maybe if I review future novels they will get the 5 stars this could easily have received.<br /><br />Well worth a read if you like this kind of thing.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|great game i am having a hard time putting it down which is a problem because i should be working
B006LSZECO|5.0|Intriguing book.....just when you decided to pull for one of the characters to win out something changed your mind! Kept me interested until the last word.
030759565X|4.0|These recipes are like something you'd find in your grandmother's top-secret cookbook. They are made from scratch, with all-natural ingredients, no shortcuts, no pre-made mixes, etc. This doesn't make it a super light or particularly \\"healthy\\" cookbook, however. When making the apple cake, for instance, I was shocked that it called for two full cups and five tablespoons of sugar (eek)! Yes, I know it's a dessert and these usually have a lot of sugar in them, but I guess I was secretly hoping I could make everything in here and not worry about my kids eating too much of something. On that note, the author does list a few substitutions you can make in the beginning of the book to make the recipes healthier, as well as vegetarian variations throughout the book.<br /><br />Here is a count of the recipes per category:<br /><br />17 Breakfast items<br />11 Salads<br />13 Sandwiches, Tarts & Pizzas<br />13 Vegetarian Main Dishes<br />12 Seafood, Poultry & Meat dishes<br />8 Cookies<br />8 Pies and tarts<br />9 Cakes<br />5 Puddings and Candy<br />10 Party Snacks and Drinks<br /><br />The PROS:<br />* Recipes are categorized very well.<br />* Ingredients needed are easy to find and usually inexpensive. They are also REAL ingredients, so you're pretty much making everything from scratch. Nothing with weird chemicals in the label.<br />* The author includes a clever/funny/witty/entertaining short story before each recipe that gives some history/insight into how she acquired the recipe or how she came up with it.<br />* Each recipe includes at LEAST one full-page, full-color photograph, and most also have photos of the ingredients or a few of the steps involved.<br /><br />The CONS:<br />* The \\"stories\\", although enjoyable, are occasionally a bit lengthy.<br />* Recipe directions are in paragraph form, rather than numbered. This, of course, depends on personal preference. I like to see the steps numbered, which helps me keep track of where I am without having to waste time by re-reading the directions to find my place again.<br />* Pretty much all of the recipes are split between two pages. By this, I mean the recipe begins on, say, page 2 (on the right hand side), and you have to flip the page over to page 3 (on the left hand side) to see the rest of the directions. Again, this is not a HUGE deal, but it has become inconvenient for me when my hands are covered in flour or whatever and I have to flip the page back and forth. It would have been better if the recipes were each spread over two opposite-facing pages. This way, the book could just stay open the whole time I'm preparing the recipe.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />Are these recipes good? Yes!<br />Are they easy? Yes, but maybe not for absolute beginners.<br />Are they quick? No, but that is part of their old-fashioned charm.<br />Am I glad I bought this and would I recommend it to a friend? Yes and YES! :)re-reading the directions to find my place again.<br />* Pretty much all of the recipes are split between two pages.
