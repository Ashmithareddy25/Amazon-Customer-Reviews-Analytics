B004SBX112|5.0|I don't know why people complain about \\"ads\\" on the pause screen. First, they don't interupt game play like those in the free versions. Second, they are only for Angry Birds items - not random crap unrelated to the game. And finally, YOU CAN TURN THEM OFF!<br /><br />There is a little piggy in the lower right corner with a mail bag. Touch the piggy and the Angry Bird offers are GONE!<br /><br />All of the Angry Bird games are lots of fun and very addicting. Seasons has a great variety of challenges and nice seasonal themes.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|It is too hard. The opponent always beats me by twice my own score. The controls are tricky, and u cant spin the ball without throwing it into the gutter. I would see pins going through pins and pins moving and then u have to throw the ball again. DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I've recently come to this show via a close friend and now I'm addicted. Excellent writing (Typical Sorkin) and the characters are engaging I can't wait to see what will happen next. Great boxed set wonderfully presented.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Great job on the album.<br />I feel that all the songs here are amazing.  Best money i spent on music in god knows how long. A friend gave me these mp3s and when i listened to this album i had to buy my own copy.<br />This artists definitely has my support
B007BLCJJ6|2.0|Good acting and so much promise in the plot but the ending, or lack thereof, will leave many disappointed and wishing they hadn't paid the price of admission.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love it, very addicting game! wish there was a way to earn gems instead of buying them..I don't waste my money on that sorry.
1466401885|1.0|The beginning was promising.  Extroverted bad boy meets introverted nice girl.  He's got a lot of room for growth and so does she.  A few chapters in, it all falls apart.  The characters devolve and remain there for the duration, the story repeats itself, showing the same boring fistfights over... nothing.<br /><br />Someone must have alerted the writer that despite all the boy tears and bloody noses, the story was a yawnfest, so halfway through she added in random bits of nonsense (mafia and fathers and vegas, oh my!) while the already poor writing circled the drain.<br /><br />I learned something interesting, though.  Apparently there is a subset of women who fantasize about abusive men.  Who knew?  I shouldn't generalize but I'm willing to bet that over 99.9999% of these women have never had a real life stalker and have certainly never been in or witnessed an abusive relationship.<br /><br />Unless abusive losers and creepy weepy stalkers are your kink, take a pass on this book.  For anyone who has been in or observed someone in an abusive relationship, this story will freak you out.  This isn't literary exploration of abusive relationships, folks.  It's someone's not-very-erotic diary.<br /><br />Also, there was a bar scene where any guys who danced with the girls 'disappeared' mid-boogie, apparently yanked away by the now supernaturally fast abusive guys.  And the girls never saw anything... leading me to suspect that this gem was Twilight fan fic at one point.

B007H51HEE|5.0|The group is finally realizing that civilization really and truly is over, and it isn't coming back. And that in a world of the living dead, failure to act has deadly consequences. Carl's failure to act indirectly cost someone their life, and Rick's failure to act will cost the group dearly in the long run. I wonder how much longer it will take the group to realize there is no kinder, gentler way of doing things any more..

B0060Q962Q|5.0|If you loved the original you'll love this version. A great app to kill some time. It looks and sounds good. The music doesn't bother me but there's an option to turn it off. The controls are smooth too. No problems placing checkers. Hoping they add feature to play other people online. HTC Thunderbolt stock. Cmon superman75 you can do better than this. I've read your reviews, like for Vegas Bowling, and they are hilarious. Next review should be top notch!  :)
B00076RT24|5.0|For all Star Wars fans who wanted to know more about the childhood of the father of Luke Skywalker, Star Wars Episode 1 is a real treat. If your one who doesn't care, then this movie isn't for you. But if your someone who wanted to know this information you will like or love this movie just as I do. This movie is the begining of the early life of Anakin Skywalker when he was a child. We get to see where he grew up, what he went through, and how he was introduced to the Jedi way. (I would tell more but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. I don't like to spoil things for people.) I first saw this movie when I was a child and could not stop watching it again and again. I fell in love with so many characters and the storyline hooks me with interest and fascination. It is because of Star Wars that I have a love for Sci-Fi. It is because of the fun, power, and passion of it that I am a fan and will remain one. I love to pop in my Star Wars DVD and be taken to a whole other world and galaxy filled with technological wonder and imagination. I love my DVD and thank George Lucas and the people who work with him for sharing this world with me.

1400069289|3.0|In my opinion Jack D. Hodge's version of \\"The Power of Habit\\" is a far better book.  Hodge's version (written before Duhigg's book) is much more practical in terms of how to actually change habits, and does a much better job of explaining why changing habits and routines are so powerful and crucial to reaching our potential.  It seems as though Duhigg borrowed heavily from Hodge's book. Both books are structurally similar and offer similar advice, however Hodge's version flows better, is more thorough, is a more enjoyable read, and offers better anecdotes and real-life examples.  You can't go wrong with either book, but Hodge's book is clearly better.

B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I loved this movie. Many believe that life would be better somewhere else, anywhere except where they are. This movie is about learning that contentment doesn't lie in running away, but in finding your bliss right where you are in the here and now! The main character, Gil, learns this lesson in the most magical way!
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|First let me say that I'm a big Boss fan and have been since the 70's. I think lyrically the man is and always has been one of the best in the business. These tracks certainly don't lack in that department. Anger, dispair, corruption, and yes even a little hope for better times are all on display in some great lyrics by one of the masters of song lyric.<br /><br />However, musically this album is WAY short of his 'Best'. For those that like this musical side of Bruce it's probably good. For me, way too much folk music mixed with some modern day looping and mixing. I've always liked Bruce better when he rocks. That signature New Jersey rock sound has always been his best sound. And this album could have used more of that. Had that been the case this might be his best ever.<br /><br />Lyrically a really good set of tracks. Musically, just not what I expected, or what most fans expect, from Bruce.
1250006341|2.0|I tried to get a look inside to see if it contained the story which is what I wanted to buy. It would not give a proper look inside. But I purchased it anyway hoping it was the story.<br />Instead it was about the filming and the period of time.  I already had a grasp on that and as an avid reader would have loved to read the book.<br />The only consolation would be a third season!!!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Where do I start?!? This headphone amplifier is by far the best ever to get the pure rich sound you've been missing. I have these paired with my SENNHEISER HD 280 PRO headphones and the sound is pure bliss through my HTC Evo and Ipods. Not only does it increase the volume of these underpowered devices  but the sound is enhanced dramatically.  I've also used it on my laptop and computer and it sounds GREAT from the speakers. The size is perfect. As you can see it is super slim and the included charging cable and 3.5 adapter is nice. Even though there is newer model out. This one works outstandingly well. I can't see how can the sound get any better then this. Get one!

B006TTC54A|1.0|I was looking forward to watching The Blues Brothers in HD and with good sound.  Sadly, this disc does not work in my Sony PS3.  It sits in the loading disc state forever and never loads.  I have the latest PS3 firmware.  Lame that Universal did not do a thorough job in QA.  All my other BluRay discs work in my PS3.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I got this app on my kindle fire. you pull ball back and let go like a bow and arrow. 1st game got a 106, 2nd game beat computer 145 to 104. not bad.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I was pretty upset once I got three disks in on The Pacific.  I was expecting something akin to Band of Brothers since it was billed as such.  What I found was that I got to watch people stare off into space, sit in the rain, run around Melbourne being drunk and sleeping with girls, shoot themselves while naked in the jungle, and basically go crazy.  I'm all about having a more \\"realistic\\" series that shows the hardships of war aside from getting shot at and seeing your friends killed.  It is VERY GOOD to try to fit that in.  But The Pacific takes it to the point of hardly showing why the men were there in the first place.  Most of the time is spent watching them do nothing.  Granted, that's what a LOT of actual war is.  Doing nothing in a very uncomfortable environment.  However, when we get down to it, this is entertainment not a documentary.  It would be a poor documentary at that.  Finally, when they DO show actual WAR it's pretty hard to tell what is actually going on.  Part of the time it is night and I couldn't tell one character from another.  Part of the time it is day but they spend most of their time running amid explosions and gunfire.  I've seen that before.<br /><br />Basically what I'm trying to say is that Band of Brothers did a pretty good job of mixing the training, planning, transport, supply, maneuvering, waiting, combat, and recover aspects of the war that the characters had to go through.  We got to see a fairly decent and realistic view in an abridged format while also being entertained in the ways expected.<br /><br />The Pacific does not deliver to nearly that degree.  So in closing, if you're in to watching people sit and think about their plight when you don't really understand the full measure of that plight, go for it.  If you actually want to see the full scope of what they went through and not just the rain, mud, heat, and bugs then I'd suggest something else.<br /><br />EDIT:  And I know I'm going to get railed because I shouldn't \\"compare it to Band of Brothers\\".  Please don't be that absurd.  It was made by the same people and advertised as such to gain a wider audience.  EVERYONE I KNOW who has ever wanted to watch The Pacific ONLY wants to watch it because it is a war series that they expect to be like Band of Brothers but in the Pacific Theatre.  EVERYONE.  So it HAS to be compared.mpare it to Band of Brothers\\".  Please don't be that absurd.  It was made by the same people and advertised as such to gain a wider audience.

B006O5Y09C|4.0|But I really enjoyed this movie! As a rule, I'm not big on Woody Allen movies, but for some reason I decided to give this one a chance. It was especially interesting to me because I have somewhat studied many of the characters that were in the movie and found them to be very well represented...and highly entertaining. I thought Salvador Dali was hilarious. However, if you don't know anything about these famous artists and writers, some of the humor might fall to the wayside.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|title says it all<br /><br />very fun and very addictive<br />starts out easy then gets challenging<br />download it now and see for yourself
B0050DIWFC|4.0|While I did enjoy the story, it at times dragged and became uninteresting.  I must say the ending blew my mind, which probably saved me from giving the book only 3 stars.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I purchased this app and soon removed it form my device due to the fact it can only be played with an online connection.<br />I have a Kindle Fire and am not always with in range of a Wifi connection so this game is very inconvenient to me 90% of my day.<br /><br />I would love to have kept it and played it more but because of the above issue I did not/could not.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is royalty awesome I don't let anyone play and I need the coins too you need more games awsom
030788743X|4.0|Loading....screech, screech. If that is familiar, you will enjoy RP1. Geek out in the virtual world of Oasis and join the hunt for the hidden 'Easter egg' in this game. James Halliday, the fabulously wealthy creator of Oasis dies, leaving his fortune to the first gamer who can find the 3 keys to open the hidden gates and win his game. Everybody uses Oasis to escape from reality and live out a better life online. Wade Watts, a.k.a. Parzival, an orphaned teenager living in poverty, becomes one of the 'Gunters' (egg hunters) and is the first person to find the first key. This book is very Anglo-American and is a clever fusion of the 80s with the future Earth, a planet ruined by our depletion of its assets and in permanent recession. If you liked the films Surrogates and Total Recall, then you should enjoy this, particularly if you are into arcade games and on-line gaming, or used to be. It is also a great book for teenagers because they can all identify with the futuristic concepts in the book unless they have been living off-planet. Virtual School, anyone? Clearly well-researched and written fluently. I have no doubt that the author is an anorak of the highest calibre and his web site is funny. Why haven't I been offered a lift in an Ectomobile? Watch out for the film - the rights have been bought by Warner Bros. (I received this book free from the UK Vine program).
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I enjoyed the fact I was able to start easy and work. at my own pace to get back to playing at an adult level.
1594744769|5.0|I opened the cover with some trepidation because the jacket photo is rather creepy...<br />However, we begin by reading about the normal life of Jacob, an American teenager, which is a little reassuring and in fact the book is less sinister than it might appear. Jacob has grown up listening to his grandfather's veiled stories and dismisses them until a tragedy occurs, which sets him on the path to Cairnholm, a Welsh island with some peculiar inhabitants in a world of their own. The story is beautifully written and interesting and it is not surprising that the film rights to the book have been bought already. Written from Jacob's viewpoint, it is a very accurate portrayal of a teenager and his thoughts and the humour is amusing. The vintage photos throughout the book are intriguing and are a major contribution to this book's originality. There is clearly going to be at least a sequel because the story doesn't finish at the end but it tapers well without too much disappointment at a natural pause. A great book for teenagers and one that will be remembered. (I received this book free from the UK Vine program).

0764169742|5.0|This book will soon have you sorting gloomily through your suddenly inadequate pencil collection. It's very reasonably priced for the great tips and techniques that you will learn. Drawings are accompanied by a list of the pencils and colours used and it has all you need (apart from talent) to start you off or improve on botanical painting. It includes flowers, vegetables, leaves and fruit and it's ideal for those wishing to improve on still life drawings. As I think others have said, Ann Swan has been extremely generous in sharing such detailed information, which is what makes this book so good.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|you need some time to get used to it!  pull the ball towards you before throwing or it will go into the gutter!!  dint like how long it takes the opponent to go but good game for free!!!

B002JTHFUS|5.0|I think this is the best box set I have ever purchased and I believe it is a very reasonably priced item.  They threw in a lot of content into this one, put it together in a beautiful package, and it is a good deal (I paid $36).  If you are a U2 fan, I think it is a great purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was somewhat disappointing. I read all 3 books in a span of 36 hours, on and off, it got increasingly difficult to keep up my interest as I read through, Book 1 was great, 2 was good, 3 was so-so. There's this certain melancholic air throughout the book and you keep hoping it'll change, there'll be a resolution in which everyone has fought of their demons but that just doesn't happen. There's a not quite there HEA, and even then it seems very forced:Peeta came back, they bond, they get married, he convinces (read nags her) into having children...but there's like zero emotion attached/described a lack luster \\"You love me, real or not real\\" where she replied \\"Real\\" hardly strikes a chord with me.<br /><br />The hunt for Snow also seemed like the most pointless bit of the book. Yes, you want to kill Snow, yes he's the bad guy. But a suicide mission especially when the Capitol is already overrun?<br /><br />\\" \\"Count on it,\\" says Castor. \\"All the streets are covered by surveillance cameras. I bet they set off the black wave manually WHEN THEY SAW US taping the propo.\\"<br />\\"Our radio communicators went dead almost immediately. Probably an electromagnetic pulse device. But I'll get us back to camp. Give me the Holo.\\" Jackson reaches for the unit...\\"<br /><br />And Bogg's last words, \\"Don't trust them. Don't go back. Kill Peeta.<br />Do what you came to do.\\" What is he even talking about? Don't trust who? Coin? She sent Peter to kill off Katniss, the very same Katniss who had a 10 man guard? There was no threat to her, none if they had waited it out at the base camp. Kill Peeta? Why? He was actually getting better by the time he was sent in, he had occassional attacks but he was quiet for the most part...<br /><br />Why did they decide to shoot the propaganda shots deeper in Capitol territory than they had captured? All this despite knowing that the intel on the pods was old and that new pods might have been positioned? Furthermore, in an area that was being monitored by Capitol cameras. Secondly, it takes roughly 1 day after they go on their \\"mission\\" to kill Snow for the rebels to take the Capitol. Why then knowing how close to victory did they all decide to go on the suicide mission? 5 or so characters, some of them very memorable(Finnick) died on a totally pointless mission that in the end doesn't even go through.<br /><br />I liked the Coin twist, it was somewhat expected but nice all the same. However, the fact that we don't get to see the apparent sway Katniss has over the people in terms of choosing a new leader was disappointing, in fact at the end she's somehwat exiled to 12, and then leads a life of obscurity...that made little sense to me. If Coin was so scared of her influence, why did Katniss,instead of killing Coin, expose her as a tyrant. Yes I get the whole avenge my sister angle but there seemed to be a bit too much gratuitous killing in the book as though human life means very little as long as you can justify the killing. Gone is the Katniss who claims that a person you kill stays with you forever.<br />There's no explanation of how Panem is doing now that it has a new start, did the districts merge into something more unified, was life better, truly better?<br /><br />All in all, I like the series but the ending...not so much.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Highly addictive. The only problem is after you get all the swords and backgrounds there is really nothing to play for. Otherwise a seemingly perfect game and a great time waster.
B005VTGB0S|4.0|My original iPad fits well and is very tight and secure in this case.  The little elastic straps on the sides are very tight and hard to stretch over the iPad, but that's probably a good thing to keep the iPad secure.  It has three different positions (angles) and the iPad fits well in the grooves so does not come out.  It also has an elastic strap on the outside that holds everything together.<br /><br />It definitely smells like leather.  It is not the fanciest case since it's an Amazon Basics, but the price is also cheaper than some cases so I think it's a good deal.
B005NC81JW|1.0|I did't like this app because it didn't have enough food choices to get my points and then points were very different then weight watchers. I felt like it was a waste of time to use this app.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Reading a Sherlock Holmes story \\"between the lines,\\" there is a good amount of \\"implied action.\\" The movie - an action film -captures this, as well as the spirit of the books, which are less dry than one might think. Downey is an enertaining screen presence, and although the accents can be difficult to understand at times, the film is one you will probably want to watch more than once.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|For me, the first book was the best in the series, but this last one was still entertaining and surprised me with the ending. If you've read the first two books you have to read Mockingjay, but don't expect to have warm fuzzies when you finish.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Works like a champ on my N1 running CM7.1, but it crashes immediately on my bone-stock Galaxy Nexus running ICS 4.0.4. Then it eats my battery like a fat kid eats cake.
B004RKXNDU|1.0|I read over one third of this book and finally had to stop.  It is not very good in my opinion.  Hard to follow and I could not see any kind of a plot.  I sure hope the movie is better than this book.  There is no \\"zero\\" star rating or I would have given it for this book.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|One thing is accurate: the ball SHOULD have to hook to score well consistently. Everything else stinks: the app goes right into the game, there are VERY limited options (only one ball so you can't adjust the hook factor of the ball...just the weight and color), you HAVE to bowl right-handed, no instructions for newbies, I could go on. This look like something someone slapped together. While the physics model looks to be ok, I am shocked there is any charge at all for this app. I wouldn't be surprised to find out it wasn't just a ruse to get info to sell to marketers. Don't waste your time.
B004UC4HCG|1.0|The shuttle was supposed to have \\"plug and play\\" hdmi, but  my shuttle hdmi never had any output. After a month of troubleshooting with the their below average customer service and trying many solutions, I finally gave up. I returned it to Amazon for free, as opposed to paying for shipping back to shuttle and being on the hook for other potential expenses as well. Glad I bought through amazon. I'm overall disappointed in the shuttle company, though.

B005NC81JW|1.0|This version didn't have a lot of the things in the point list and I was still searching online to find some point values.  It also had some wrong point values. example: pita any kind was 4 pts. but when I calculated my whole wheat pita it was only 1.5. there are many things listed that way,  such as cheese: hard, any kind. there are too many kinds to be lumped together like that.  the 4.99 app takes your weight, age, etc. into account, shows your points, plus the extra you should get in a week, and how many points you get if you have exercised. this version gives everyone 29 points with no extra you spread out over the week. I thought I would be fine with cheaper app cause I only really wanted a calculator but I just didn't like the point list it had and when I found innaccurate point values... an item listed as 4 points in their point list but comes up 1.5 when I use their calculator to calculate same item... that is a big difference. so I bought the 4.99 app and quit this one.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this series. I had been waiting for this second chapter to come out for quite a while. I got to view and enjoy the whole 2nd series before it aired on Masterpiece Theater. It was also shipped well protected and arrived quickly.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|When Wuthering Heights was originally published in 1847, it was not well received. The depictions of passionate love affairs on the moors, cruelty and hatred were considered to vulgar and too shocking for audiences of the day. Wuthering Heights is now considered a classic of English literature and one of the best novels by a woman writer of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />There is something outright haunting about the characters of Wuthering Heights. They complement the eerie moor setting entirely. None of the characters is likable really, but there is something about them that hypnotizes the reader. Heathcliff's passionate love, rage, hatred and unbelievable cruelty, Catherine's puerile and fickle nature just to name a few.<br /><br />Wuthering Heights is not a happy love story by any stretch of the imagination. It is dark, yet passionate. It explores both sides of human nature. The characters can love passionately, then hate completely and cruelly.<br /><br />It is a bit difficult to get into. The opening chapters are very dark and Brontë takes a while to set up the characters, especially with the frame story involving Mr. Lockwood, but if the reader sticks with it, the characters are great, the plot is twisted and the raw emotional language Brontë uses are worth waiting for.<br /><br />See more of my reviews @ [...]<br />Bottom Line: Wuthering Heights is a must read for English literature lovers and dark romance lovers alike. It's complex, passionate characters are awful but hypnotizing.<br /><br />View all my reviews
B0071PS7AC|4.0|I don't know what's the deal with the bad reviews.  The computer skill is average, though it would be nice to adjust the handicap.  The controls a just fine, at least they are on a 10&quot; tablet.  I can see how a game like this would be impossible to play on a phone.  Also, the money thing is completely pointless.  It would be nice to have some kind of tournament set up or something that would keep you going.  All in all it's probably worth the 99 cents, but if the dev just spent a little more time adding some minor features to keep the player interested, it would be a winner.  All in all, this game has good mechanics and good graphics, but no sense of progression to keep me interested.  There's a lot of potential wasted.
B004LROMWU|4.0|Falling sky is a decent attempt at a sci-fi show but is bogged down with the family show cliche writing. It has potential but for an alien invasion post apocalyptic environment the show really needs a darker tone.
0439023513|4.0|I read through these books in a handful of days because my 6th grade daughter wants to read them and I was concerned about the possible content in them.<br /><br />What I found wasn't at all what I expected in a young adult set of novels. The content that I was worried about, Twilight-ish \\"romantic\\" content, wasn't to be found hardly anywhere in the series. However, the content dealing with the violence and the after affects of such systemic violence as from war and slavery (which is really what the citizens of the districts are) was very prevalent and just at the edge of what I think my daughter is ready for.<br /><br />Now, specifically to this novel.<br /><br />Unlike the preceding novels, this one deals dramatically and in depth with issues of being involved in war and slavery. Especially, from a soldier's point of view. To this end Mrs. Collins achieved her desired goal very well. The pacing and tone of the book and its involved characters is exceptionally well handled to drive home the point of those effects.<br /><br />I have read some reviews that complain about the change in the characters, how they aren't the same characters from the first novels, and I have read many reviews here that state that was the point, which I agree with. Of course the characters aren't the same at the end of the trilogy as they were at the beginning, that is the point. If they were the same then what would the point of the story have been? What sets this series apart from many other novels is how much the characters change and how many of them undergo this radical change. My feeling is that many of the people who were upset about the changes in the characters likely read these novels as they were released. The long time span between reading the books would make it harder to spot the natural progression of the characters as they react to their experiences. Reading all three of these novels at the same time makes it feel more like a single long novel and given how the novels all start basically right where the last left off, this a more natural way to consume this trilogy.<br /><br />Katniss' struggles with what is obviously PTSD and her war related injuries, physical and psychological, is exceptionally well handled in this book. I have read where some people thought that the pacing/plot was not well handled because it seemed disjointed and that there is a lot of \\"telling\\" going on in this novel. Well, yeah, that is the point. This is the novel where Katniss steps into the role of soldier. This is the novel where you get to experience, through Katniss, the disjointed nature of their lives. The fact that major events happen away from them and yet have a profound affect on their lives. The fact that they will have good moments and bad moments. That in a very real way they don't feel in control of their lives or even themselves. That their life feels disjointed and instead of having the power to affect events they are simply told about those events and then told what they are going to do about those events.<br /><br />All of this being said, it wasn't all good. The \\"romantic\\" scenes in this book seem forced, like Collins was writing this great story and someone kept reminding her that she was writing a novel in a category where Twilight was popular, and because of that she needed to write in some romantic angst. If that was the case I wish that someone had kept their mouth shut. It added virtually nothing to story of any worth, and in some cases detracted from the power of the story and its message. All of the relevant parts could have easily been accomplished without Gale, or at least without Gale as a romantic interest.<br /><br />Heck, Gale was a weak point period because he never really managed to make it past his angry, rebellious bad-boy archetype. This wouldn't have been bad, if he hadn't been forced into the role of \\"other romantic interest\\".<br /><br />The forced romantic relationship between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale irreparably damagedthe other aspect of war and its consequences, dealing with those who have suffered its affects. The spouse who returns from war is a different person than the one who left and their significant other doesn't have a problem dealing with that because they have some other person on the side that they are constantly trying to decide between, but because the other person is the person that they remember and had feelings for and this person who returned. By interjecting Gale into this story in the way that Mrs. Collins did she pretty much neutered Katniss' difficulty in dealing with the war damaged Peeta. You can almost see her desire to deal with this when she struggles with accepting that \\"her\\" Peeta is lost forever, but then the message is watered down or completely lost in the noise of the \\"mandatory\\" Katniss / Gale romance.<br /><br />It also would have helped out Katniss' character to feel some angst about how she treated Peeta in this book, not because she was stuck in some forced feeling love-triangle, but because she truly felt guilty about what happened to him because of her. To approach the issues that Katniss was having with Peeta, not because he necessarily was someone that she loves, but because he was a brother in arms who suffered terribly because of what she feels is her fault.<br /><br />My point is that Katniss could have just as easily, and more realistically, felt pretty much everything that she did because she was struggling with her love for and feelings of obligation to Peeta coupled with her inability to deal with the brainwashed person sitting in front of her as compared to the Peeta that she knew before -- so well symbolized by the pearl.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT]<br /><br />As for the ending. At first, I didn't like it. Katniss and her team struggled and suffered so much to basically fail to achieve their goal at the end. Then the denouement seemed to be no real resolution at all, although I liked the epilogue. However, after reading the third part of the novel again and looking at it from the perspective of the story as a whole, I realized that this was just another very well executed example of dealing with war. The point of the third part wasn't really to kill Snow and have the happy ending, it was to provide the sucker punch to the gut that was to drive the real awful truth of war and soldiers home. The entire story and all of its events were set off because Katniss wanted to keep Prim safe. All of her suffering and all of the things that her friends and loved ones suffered were a direct result of her attempt to keep Prim away from harm, but no matter what happens and no matter how much a soldier might suffer in the end they very well might fail to achieve what they fought for. After everything that Katniss suffered she did manage to free the Districts from the Capitol, and because of that she is hailed as a hero by the reader and the characters in the novel. But for Katniss, she failed. No matter how much she suffered and endured her stepping up to take Prim's place for the games ultimately led to her dying. And that is likely the hardest aspect for a soldier to take and for those that support them to realize, the feeling that everything you did and everything you suffered didn't achieve what you personally desired.<br /><br />With this new insight into the ending I have to say that I went from liking the epilogue to loving it. The epilogue is the reward for the soldiers if everything goes well. The epilogue is the \\"happy ending\\" that those suffering through war can hope for. Not that they will make it through unscathed, the trauma will always be with them, but that their children will have a better life because of what they suffered. That their children will have a better life because of them. For a girl who early in the book stated emphatically that she would never have children because of the world, this is her reward, not sound mental health or a completely whole spouse, but children who can run and play without concern on the grave of the past.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The interview style of the writing just didn't make the book flow for me. Really hard to get into a book when the characters constantly change. Even a tad confusing the way the interviews bounced back and forth to all different parts of the world. I didn't even realize that one of the US military officers had multiple interviews scattered throughout the book until I was near the end. It just felt so disjointed to me.<br /><br />There were some good interesting stories but there were some incredibly boring ones too. Even the good ones were a little disappointing because once I finally found a story I enjoyed and began to get into the book, the story ended.<br /><br />Not terrible, but not a masterpiece either. Enjoyed the \\"Day by Day Armageddon\\" series much more. Not really sure how the movie is going to turn out. What character is Brad Pitt going to play? There weren't really any main characters.<br /><br />Obviously the interview style wasn't a problem for most, but for me it just didn't work.
0345529057|5.0|For weeks time stopped in the real world while I entered into a relationship with this 5 part series of books. It was like a vacation in a time machine; a vacation I will never forget. What fun. I can't wait to go there again sometime in the future with other Martin books.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|i think the game is alright (except, the steering is really hard), however, the premise isn't the best. like another reviewer said, i am not sure the whole premise of being in Las Vegas was needed. you could easily just make it a bowling game were you used your score to by balls, lanes, etc.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is amazing. It captivates you from the very beginning and is a page Turner! It had mystery, mischief, and is over the top amazing. I hope you can get the joy out of it as much as I did. I couldn't pit this down for Even few minutes! His book is 100% worth your time and money. James Dashner  is absolutley a fantastic writer and did an OUTSTANDING job with this.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game that challenges the mind and also lets you challenge your previous best score.  New challenges introduced throughout various levels.  Gets one thinking outside the box.
B006T5G73Y|2.0|I normally love Clint Eastwood movies, but this one does not work for me.................It lacked the tautness and narrative pace I have come to expect from his films.  I do not think he is losing his touch because the recent Changeling I found to be very well done.  Everything seemed wrong in this film...............narrative POV, lighting, makeup, you name it.  The ONLY good scenes to me were the clip of Cagney playing a Fed in the movie G Men and the subsequent scene at the Stork Club where Hoover is obviously distressed by the heterosexual attention paid him by Ginger Rogers and her party...................that was Clint as his best...music, lighting, blocking.............things that suffered in the remainder of the film.  I hope he comes back with something better.

B0071PS7AC|2.0|The controls r hard to understand at first. If u pull back on the ball then move right or left the slide down the lane it works w/o too much spin. It will go where u aim...still not a very good bowling app &amp; i would be upset if i paid for this game. Hope this helps :)

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I love Tina Fey, and this is a very funny book.  I really knew very little about her background, so it was fun learning she grew up outside of Philly.  I also liked learning about how she moved to Chicago after college and her experiences with Second City.
B0060Q962Q|2.0|greetings fellow amazonians after my triumphant return to work yesterday at maury's cheese factory I walked into work feeling like a king. I even went up to tyrone my boss and told him to shove it. well tyrone really didn't like that so he challenged me to a connect 4 battle with the loser leaving town.  remembering todays faotd I quickly downloaded the app so we could get our grove on. little did I know that tyrone is a master connect 4 champion and has won tournaments in China, Dubai and in Tanzania. after our fifth game tyrone banished me from the warehouse. he said I didn't have to leave town, but I needed to learn some manners so he sent me to the local elementary school so I could go back to kindergarten.<br /><br />So off to the Gordie Howe Elementary School where I went to Ms. Rebecca's class. she taught me about sharing, being friendly and even told me about these things called colors. I don't know how long tyrone will make me go here, but at least this beats churning the curds and whey.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|Heavy on CGI, lots of blood and guts most of which are unnecessary, fairly well acted, poor story line. Very predictable. Don't waste your money wait for free view on cable then watch something else.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|As a gamer and a computer programmer, I enjoyed this book greatly. I actually haven't been exposed to all the referenced games, films, music, but I still loved this book. A few days later and I still find myself thinking about various parts of the book.<br /><br />That being said, a lot of the references were spoon fed to the reader. I suppose that's what made it okay for me to not have seen, played, or heard them before!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I had read a recommendation praising this book, and Thank You Kindle Fairy, I began to read it immediately.  I was gripped by the story, which I found moved along quickly.  I like the back and forth between the grand jury testimony and the events surrounding Jacob, the son of the protagonist Andy Barber.<br />Midway through the book the foreshadowing, which is excellent, began to tickle my brain harder and harder.  i formed a few of opinions; some were met, others weren't.  I was led off my thought trail by a description of a happy time the family enjoyed, and then WHAMMO!<br />I saw the ending coming and it still startled me.<br />I very much enjoy the author's style, and I too couldn't put it down, especially the last 25 pages which I read at work begging coworkers for \\"just one more minute!\\".  I highly recommend this book to anyone fascinated by legal wranglings, murder mysteries and understanding the human psyche.
B004UID2LC|5.0|you definetly should get this if you love music or watch videos..and it is free!!!<br />I&lt;3 THIS APPPPPPPPP!!!!!!:D and you also should rate this when u install this app
B000YKE87W|3.0|I agree with others that Kaufmann's voice on this recording is a bit monochromatic.  He's developed more musicality in the past few years, so if you're interested, pick up a later recording--you're very likely to find more to love in his more recent CDs!<br /><br />I actually like the darker quality of his voice; to me it's more relaxed than the usual way-bright sound of lighter more Italianate tenors.  Where other people hear \\"dark dark dark,\\" I hear ease and openness--maybe that's a personal thing, maybe it's because I'm a more dramatic voice and tend to prefer dramatic voices. YMMV!<br /><br />For a better idea of what he's doing NOW, look for recent recordings on Youtube or hit one of his performances.

B004LWZW4C|3.0|This was an entertaining attempt at making a great movie, but somewhere it fell by the wayside. The action was great, but it just didn't make this movie \\"awesome\\" per se. The characters were pretty cool, but I just didn't really like the young Xavier. I kept seeing the actor from Wanted, and couldn't wait for him to drop the f-bomb as Dr. X. Magneto's character was pretty interesting, but he still seemed less traumatized than someone would be after being tortured by Nazis. Overall, this movie is worth a buy, if only for some of the great action sequences and Kevin Bacon as a crazy mutant.
B0052U59F4|1.0|I don't really understand all of the hype surrounding this book. As a twenty something, I certainly have a better understanding of English and writing. This book, is horrid and it's a bit like Twilight.<br /><br />Why can't people write books with substance anymore?<br /><br />What I did enjoy in this book however, is the education the author attempted to bring into the book about the D/s relationship. As one who practices in the lifestyle (M/s) we are usually painted with a horrible broad brush.<br /><br />It wasn't for me though.
B00406UK5A|1.0|The picture of the \\"Centurion\\" shows BlueRay + Digital Copy but the one I received is only available in Blueray. Please take off this picture if you want to sell this product in Blueray format only.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|Coldplay shone with Parachute.  Their \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" was brilliant.  Thereafter, it's been downhill all the way.  And, as one reviewer pointed out, their \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is abysmal. The lyrics in this album could have been written by just about any sorry-ars* boy band. I felt so let down that I wish I had downloaded the album for free instead of paying for it.  I am terribly disappointed.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Love the variety.  The response was good most of the time. Would recommend it. Nice to have different backgrounds and music choices.

0671449028|5.0|This was one of the first Sandra Boynton books I had picked up and we have been reading it to our nine month old daughter every night since she was about six months old.  Usually, during story time she is very talkative and a big wiggle worm, but as soon as we begin this story, \\"The sun has set not long ago..\\" she immediately calms down and actually seems to be listening. The verses flow wonderfully and the pictures are cute. This is one we will be keeping for many years to come.
B000002AHM|5.0|There is not a whole lot to add to all the previous reviews here. I first bought this way-back-when on vinyl, and played it to death, lol. I was extremely lucky to see these three guitar masters play together twice...it was incredible! The fun they were having together spread into the crowd watching (and the two shows I saw were at a couple of small venues in NYC). The joy they shared onstage was infectious, and there were laughs all night long, and plenty of whooping it up by the attendees (many of which were quite well-dressed. There is nothing like watching a guy in a tux jump up on his chair shouting and whistling at the stage, lol). The only thing you need to do with this CD is put it on, sit back, and have a great time.
1451627289|5.0|I am not a fan of Stephen King, but I needed something to read on a flight, and 11/22/63 just stood out to me at the airport bookstore. It was not a novel that I couldn't put down, which I actually enjoyed. The book moved along at a great pace, and the character development was excellent. This was a truly enjoyable read, and I was impressed. I love that King places his story right on top of the pages of history and includes actual historical facts and accuracy in the story. It was a great mix of love, history, action, and just plain story-telling.
0446547603|3.0|Nicholas Sparks has written many excellent novels and all of his work is very good.  Safe Haven does not rank among his best, but is still a good read.  The plot is interesting and as always with a Sparks' novel, there is true romance and some tragic circumstances.  Unlike his other works, this novel contains an evil antagonist and some intense dangerous scenes.  The descriptions were somewhat choppy and I think this type of writing is not the author's strong suit.  There was much that was not believable in the plot, but it was still an enjoyable read.
B0060Q962Q|4.0|Great game app, I spend at least a hour playing this game with my wife. A nice flash back to when we were young.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|What a great movie. I am a fan of the movie \\"The Champ\\" with John Voight. This one has it all just like \\"The Champ\\".
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I was skeptical to buy this product after reading so many negative reviews. But I am glad i did. First it adds just the right amount of color so that I feel I have personalized it and got away from all black.  I like that it snaps right into the case letting me know that it is protected and won't fall out. The front cover does seem flimsy and the easel doesn't always stay up for me or else I would have given it 5 stars.  However even though the cover is flimsy it still protects my screen while the kindle fire is in my purse. So in the end it does its job.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Parents that have babies that wake 20 times a night, for years, will find that this technique works. What a relief.Children who are able to wait and delay gratification have been shown in extensive research to be more successful in their lives. Makes sense to me. The book is a user friendly read with the right balance of evidence and anecdotal comment. It is a real gem.
B00316DDUE|5.0|There is a lot of discussion here about whether other Yanni concerts were better. I won't try to add to that. They are all great. What is truly remarkable on the Blu-ray is the DTS HD MA sound quality. They recorded 125 channels using state-of-the-art technology, then mixed down to a 5.1 master. Since DTS Master Audio is a truly lossless and accurate format, the instruments and voices sound as if they are right in the living room. It's like being at the concert with the freedom to wander the stage and interact with the soloists as they perform. An incredible listening experience!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played in a really long time. Very addicting!!!! Not too hard, but not too easy either. Love all the levels so far.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|The problem with the living legends is always in the way they refuse to live as legends - or better, let the legend part die and rest in peace. Yes, \\"Lulu\\" is far from being a successful experiment, but there are always far more unbearable things in life than a 95-minute travesty that everyone likes to hate so much. For example, imagine Yoko Ono \\"doing\\" spoken word parts instead...

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app for over a year and I love it. Especially enjoying the devotionals right now.  I would recommend this app to anyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I've ever devoured a book so quickly. While the storyline is exceedingly fascinating and perfectly pitched, the character development is in a class of its own. By the end of this book (I consider the omnibus edition the book), I felt like I've known these characters my whole life and genuinely want to know more about them. Just brilliant. And FWIW, I would be willing to bet the bank that we'll see a Wool movie in the future. It's just perfectly transferrable to the screen.<br /><br />Hugh, if you do read this review, I do have one point of criticism-- the pricing of this book is all wrong. Amazon kept recommending it to me, but I kept ignoring it because the pricing was so low, thinking you get what you pay for. You my friend are most certainly not an amateur. I would have easily paid $10-15 for this book ( especially with a rare 5 star rating) and still felt like I got a hell of a deal. Please don't sell yourself short. I think the low pricing is actually keeping this book out of the hands of a lot of people. Keep up the great work, and I'm going to buy the rest of your books before you become famous and the prices start to go up ; )
B0071NLG0W|3.0|I was a bit concerned when I saw a description of this book classifying it as chic lit.  I am glad I did not listen.  The main character, Amber Fox, is a female investigator for an insurance group.  She is asked to find the daughter of a voodoo priestess (who Amber has helped before).  In the search she uncovers a  trail of deceit and murder. Although it does have a bit of romance and some pretty decent humor, it is first and foremost a mystery and a pretty good one at that.  It is well written with excellent characters (especially a strong female lead).  Although it is not as hard core a mystery as I usually read, I will likely read another Amber Fox mystery when I need something a bit different.
0061537934|4.0|I'm not a dog owner, but I understand the draw that a good sappy dog book can have for people.  And maybe it's because I came to this book with the right mindset that I was able to enjoy it for what it was.<br /><br />The book is well written and easy to read.  I actually enjoyed seeing some of the issues through the eyes of a third party with little understanding of the undertones of human behavior.  I needed a book with a happy, satisfying ending, and this one delivered.<br /><br />My only concerns were that some of the storylines were drawn out much longer than I felt was necessary.  Denny's wife hangs on for what seems like forever before succumbing to cancer, and the drawn out suffering gets a little old and draining for the reader.  I understand that this may actually be the experience of some cancer victims, but it seemed like every page she was on death's doorstep, only to hang on for a couple more months.<br /><br />The other storyline that got old was the legal battle between Denny and his in-laws over Zoe.  At the beginning I was involved in the storyline, but as it kept going and going and going, I stopped caring who won in the end.  I know this kind of delay can be an actual issue with our legal system, but it doesn't make for good reading.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was a good, quick fluff read, and I came away from the book feeling good and hopeful about life for the next hour or two.  It was a nice distraction between some other books with much heavier topics.
0739383728|5.0|The book is extremely fun to read. I listen to it while driving home-office and I cannot stop smiling. The reader is doing a great job. In addition I learnt a lot about Ultramarathons, human endurance and passion. Highly recommended.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|The idea behind this is cool, however in practice, its bulky and ungainly. The \\"amp\\" itself is small, but after you have the cord connecting it to your music device and your music device plugged into it, its just not worth it. sure it sounds a bit better than just playing straight from your headphones, but unless your sitting at a desk or something, i would say its not worth it. Also the battery life is very short.
1451627289|2.0|After the excellence of Full Dark, No Stars, I was really hoping S. King was getting back to form.  This book crushed that for me.  It's the first Stephen King book (and I've read them all) I actually thought about giving up on (and I made it through Insomnia, for pete's sake).  It's about twice as long as it needs to be.  This is not a good investment of your time.<br /><br />It has every single-cliche in the King arsenal - the autobiographical 6'5\\" English professor (that naturally gets to nail the hot young blonde), the old unrepentant smoker, the stupid nonsensical catch phrase repeated over and over (\\"Jimla\\"), wound-too-tight domestic violence guy, the \\"harmonization\\" to take care of all the plotholes, and the racist Christian rednecks.  This is in addition to the jock who just wants to be in the arts, Church Lady, etc....<br /><br />The book focuses in large part on the tedious romance of the two main characters with very little action to speed things along.  The actual assassination is covered in few pages, while we get chapters and chapters of the Oswald's home life and boomer nostalgia.  The ending, while not as ridiculous as the virgin gangbang at the end of It, is still too long and incongruous with the rest of the story.  Worst of all, it's boring.<br /><br />We also get lots of anti-racism lectures from a guy who grew up in, and currently lives in, Maine and was a millionaire by his mid-twenties.  His afterwords contains the cringe-worthy statement that Texas is still backwards because some bars there have signs that say \\"No guns allowed\\".  Can you be more out of touch, Steve?  I've seen bars with those signs all over the country, they're just in parts of town that you would never ever go to.<br /><br />Again, Full Dark No Stars was excellent.  I'm certainly not giving up on King yet, but I can't recommend this book to anyone.

0553582038|1.0|Having read and enjoyed the first three books in quick succession, I was eager to continue the series. This book is boring, goes nowhere, and as far as I can tell should pretty much be skipped. Find a summary if you can.<br /><br />Martin has a tendency to kill off seemingly main characters, which is fine and withstandable when there are plenty of characters that you know and are invested in. After three books unfortunately there are few left and this book does not focus on almost any of them. The new ones that Martin tries to elevate largely fall flat.<br /><br />I really think each book in a series should be able to stand alone with a true beginning, middle, and end--even if tied directly to others. Martin apparently doesn't agree and this one seems one of the worst.<br /><br />I compare this to the middle seasons of Lost, where the writers seemed to have lost their way and didn't truly have an end game in mind. Maybe Martin can pull it back together, but he better do it soon or he's going to lose this reader and probably many others.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|The Boss does it again!  Whether you like it or not,  he gets you thinking.  His lyrics and music speaks to our times.  Like Guthrie, Dylan and Cash,  he singing about something real!
1451648537|5.0|There is a bit of repetition in the story; I considered it acceptable bearing in mind the length of the book.  I also found it difficult to grasp who the author was talking about on a number of occasions.  He would suddenly refer to someone by their first name and they had not been mentioned for quite some time.  Eventually I found I just had to ignore those instances since they really did not matter that much to the overall impression of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />I like the way the author finishes the book.  He was given a free hand to write what he considered the truth about Steve and I believe that he has done an excellent job.  He provided the truth with balance and a fair amount of explanation.  While I admire what Jobs did and the company he created, I am not sure I could have put up with his treatment of other people.<br />Jobs had a potty mouth<br /><br />I think the book helped the stock price of Apple to soar, perhaps with justification.  Jobs left a real legacy and I think this book is worth the read.
0061714372|3.0|If you are a big fan of mustaines, you will like this book, as he gives his own take on things, considering he has been through some hard times.  In general, he doesnt come across as what some people would label a whinger, just trying to explain why certain things happened in his life.  There is no doubting his talent as a guitarist, as he is one the all time greats, he practically contributed to half of metallicas first album, and part of their second, and went on to form his own band, which acheived great things.<br /><br />However, this review isnt about how proficient he is on guitar, its about the book, and there is some mud slinging that he has done, that have let him down.  I don't really want to spoil it for people who havent read it yet, but talks about one ex band member, if you search hard enough on the net, this ex band member rubbishes the story, long before it ever appeared in this book.<br /><br />Thats not to say that some of the stories weren't true, I just think that some part ofs of the book, you have to take with a pinch of salt.  Overall, This book is a good read, but some of the stories sound a bit over the top, and in a way, I felt slightly let down, in that I thought he had started to leave his days of back stabbing behind him.

B001AEF6D6|5.0|Yes, this slacker fan classic is just as good today as it was in 1998. And this version is loaded with a good number of extras.<br /><br />Now, I see super-fans are disappointed. It's true, if you own a earlier DVD version, this edition, even with it's extra disc doesn't add anything super-special. And, this version is hardly definitive, super-fans will want more, no doubt.<br /><br />But for the casual fan, the person who doesn't already own a copy and just wants to watch this fabulous film, along with enough extras to make a casual fan happy- here ya go.<br /><br />Now, I am writing this review assuming you have seen the film. If you have not, this film is almost impossible to describe. It's a slacker-comedy, with a mystery and some by-notes on the meaning of life. Satire is there, but nicely understated. You can watch this film on several levels, but I suggest just cracking a cold one and watching it for the fun of it.<br /><br />But although \\"The Dude\\" (played by Jeff Bridges at his best) is foul-mouthed, this is not a gross out doper movie like many which followed. There's also a fab supporting cast, and solid locations.<br /><br />A solid strike of a film.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|Oh my word. We watched Tremors on cable recently and had to rush out and buy the movie. My 13-year-old son loved it. I had no idea they made FOUR movies in this series!<br /><br />Yes there is some swearing in each movie. Not a lot. Young teens, especially boys, will love the survival themes and battle scenes in these films. My son's favorite is Tremors 2.<br /><br />If you are looking for similar movies with themes of survival, battling opponents, etc. I suggest you try: [[ASIN:B000DBHX4M Zathura]], [[ASIN:B001FZG47C Small Soldiers]], and for silly fun, [[ASIN:B000068MC4 Spaced Invaders]].<br /><br />Enjoy.

B004LWZW88|4.0|We own most of the animated films that have been released in the last two decades. Unfortunately, Puss in Boots just didn't thrill me. Generally there are elements to appeal to both kids and adults, not so much this time. The dance scenes were random and all of the plot points involving lies, deceit, and more lies, turned me off.<br /><br />It was just ok. I'm sure young kids will enjoy it. My 13-year-old boy felt it was fine, but I doubt he will reach for it again anytime soon.

0756407125|1.0|I loved book one, I waited years for this book. I was so excited to start reading it. Then within the first chapter I was disappointed. The author I guess wanted Kvothe to start out fresh with no money or belongings. So he says everything was taken in this shipwreck. Which might have been a neat start to the story, but no. You just start walking down the road with him with nothing to his name....again. I felt so sad as i continued to read this novel. The characters started to flatten out and the plot was twisted to the authors desire. I think the author had an end on how he wants the character to turn out and is forcing story line to fit it.  I am not sure why the author took so long on this book or didn't listen to his editor. You can sum this whole book into 3 sentences ...along with some very odd sex training...school? I would read the first one again, but I am not sure what this book was, it wasn't a complete novel, it was long enough, but there was no point to it. I would ask the author who wrote the first book, to create a new book 2, and maybe keep for an extra interlude for the die hards? Although I was one before I read this book. It was really bad.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I am a very serious fan of Phantom of the Opera and over 25 years ago I saw this play in NYC with Michael Crawford as the Phantom and Sarah Brightman as Christine.  OMG I never forgot it.  This was so wonderful to watch this anniversary special at the Royal Albert Theatre on Fathom Events in our local movie.  I have seen this opera several times after as well and I am seeing it at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas this coming June.  This is truly a masterpiece.  Im so happy to get this.
0142418471|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, the characters were believable and had some depth. The book was easy and fun to read. The story switches between first person view points of the two Will Grayson's. The only problem I had with this book was how dramatically the two styles looked. The second Will Grayson does not use proper capitalization, punctuation or even spelling at times. While the first Will Grayson is perfection. I understand that the purpose is to set a difference in tone between the two but I found it irritating at first. It is not enough to take away from the story. The story is good but it lacks substance, it is a very fluffy read with a few good attempts at a point. I would mostly recommend this as a entertaining read not an intellectually stimulating one.
B00785P2QC|3.0|its fun its just hard to earn moneeyy fassterr. I wish it was a outlet easier tovget money but its still exciting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I understand the 1 star reviews, but I like having to unlock the next games. You don't just play the same things over and over, and you're actually working toward something. So many ads are kind of annyoying, though.
B004LWZW8S|4.0|I saw this movie in 3D when it came out in theaters and I actually liked it, not loved, but it was decent for what it was trying to do. It has the obvious comparisons to 300 which was, ultimately, better (I guess). The visuals are stunners. The acting decent. If you are constantly comparing this movie to 300 in your head while watching it then you will come away from it not impressed. Just watch it as a stand alone movie and not a 300 comparison which I did. I liked it enough to buy it on blu-ray so a hater I am not.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded on kindle fire and it is awesome! Great graphics, customizable, lots of fun. My eight year old is even playing it now...after she customizes it HER way!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|It is a great game, the downside, when you update it, you have to practically restart the game. So everything you earned you have to earn again. But you do unlock kore things. It is a game to play when you are bored.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Great game!  Exactly as described.  I would highly recommend this to all especially younger gen.  Fun way to stay occupied during slow times.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded it for Kindle Fire and I'm really enjoying it, I really like the movement of the card, the options, by far the best solitaire app I've tried.<br />The only things I find a little annoying are the ads, but I'd still definitely recommend it!!

B0034JKZ8G|3.0|Always interested in what Disney releases next, I was hoping to really enjoy this movie.  But, I can't quite put my finger on just what was 'wrong' and didn't enjoy it as much as some of the 'classics.'  The alligator was wonderful.  I didn't really care for the villian (not that I am supposed to care for him...)but didn't like the character at all.

B000FC12SM|4.0|There's nothing ground breaking in this book, but the first half was interesting to read and it does go into detail nicely on a lot of things, like the 12 kinds of love, for example. After the first half, though, I found it to be painful, repetitive, and \\"cheesy\\" to read and I had to put it down a couple times over 2 days until I finally just gave up because it got too boring (and cheeeeeeesy) for me.<br /><br />Either way, at $4.55 for the Kindle Version, it's definitely worth to buy and read I'd say, and I got a few things out of it none-the-less. So I still gave it 4 stars.
B001G5ZKZS|1.0|Man i would love to see this concert- to bad the director wont let me. If you can count to 5 before he changes carmeras or moves the shot- you can count really fast. Good god its RUSH I think they can put on a show that I would enjoy without having to have the sceen changed every 5 seconds= there Outta be a law, otherwise Great sound and great value for the money= I just wish I could actually watch the concert.

1612130283|5.0|I purchased all three books and couldn't stop until I read all of them. My week belonged to Christian and Ana.  I began to feel like Ana. I felt her emotions, felt her fear, felt her hope and even felt her mixed emotions when it dealt with the \\"dark side\\" of Christian. There is a fine line between maintaining \\"the who you are\\" to abandoning yourself and your inner-soul to another.  I didn't want their story to end because I would have to come back to reality when that happened.  GREAT JOB............ L James.....this was a different kind of a love story, but you made it seems so possible. I would give you ten stars because you deserved them.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this is an amazing film. very inspirational, and thought-provoking. it causes one to rethink their life and to aspire to be something more, to have a closer relationship with God. definitely recommend it. it is a must-have in every Christian household

B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so nice to have the read along feature. It really helps move me along much quicker and enjoyable.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but its not as engaging as the early books. Perhaps, this is partially due to familiarity with the general story line, but I believe there are portions of this book that are long and boring. Also, the structure of books 4 and 5 seemed a little odd (Books 4 and 5 occur at the same time, but address different character sets). Nonetheless, I did find the continuation of the story interesting and worth the investment in time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Couldn't ask for anything better. All you need to stay in The Word. Plus it's free! Can't beat that. Kudos.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|its a fun game. good music and competitive. its a little boring cause the computer can be stupid and u can cheat.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Another good one by Lee Child. If you enjoy reading the Reacher novels you will enjoy this one.Try it, you will enjoy it.
B007HNFREW|5.0|I've read all the books, got the audiobooks and my reaction to thus the visual representation is that it is SUPERB.<br />A very faithful version indeed and exactly as I had visualised it from the text.<br />Stunning.......
B0052U59F4|2.0|I have read other books of this nature so when I saw this one on the Today Show, I was interested to read it.  I, frankly, do not understand the craziness surrounding this book.  I agree with some others that it's not very well written and it repeats quite a bit.  This book is no different than the likes of Delilah Devlin, who also writes erotic novels but doesn't have so much fluff and character development.  Maybe that's why this is so popular?  People identify with the character??? I prefer books by Devlin where she gets to the point, writes graphically, and keeps you interested.  The scenes in this book are dull and the descriptions lack vision.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Pretty decent for my 6 year old granddaughter. Some of them are kind'a boring, but still not bad. Keeps her entertained...

076790592X|5.0|I was lucky that I read this before there was too much hype. (Hype always kills books/films for me.) The discussions with Morrie were incredibly touching. So much so that, while reading, I found myself often wishing I knew the man. I'd love for my sons to read this once they're old enough.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy reading and studying the Bible using this app. I love that there are different versions to compare,and I use the commentary as a study guide.Thank you for making this available.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|I would not have thought I would love this movie. I didn't see it until years after it came out, when I bought it for super cheap. It just just so likeable! Bridget is annoying but loveable, and Grant and Firth play dashing gents that you just want to have for yourself! The dirty humor is helarious, even more so because it's coming out of Brits' mouths! I have found myself watching this one and the sequel over and over for a laugh. They are funny, fun movies that are worth picking up by any rom-com fan!
B004X6PRO6|2.0|If you want to read a long, drawn out, depressing book full of torture and poverty -- this is it. I should have written the review immediately after reading it a month ago. As it is, all I can remember is having to force myself to plod through the dreary story.
B003LQMZS0|3.0|My 7 month old son is teething so he was biting the ends (one tooth coming in, other than that, he's all gums) and he hurt his mouth on the striped mirror. He's fine, no injuries. There are teething pieces on the end of this toy that are softer for his gums, but babies cannot differentiate. He likes this toy, but gets bored with it fast.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book in decades, but thought I'd give this one a shot. It's a very compelling story, and Stephen King's writing skills are excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it.
B005B3T45I|2.0|The first unit I purchased didn't work right.  I returned it and got a second unit.  It had the same problems.  While the unit has a simple interface, when you reach the point in transcribing where you have to enter the song titles, I had all kinds of problems.  Often after the second or third song title entry, I was unable to enter any more.  Some songs didn't transfer.  One Favorite record I tried four times to convert to digital without success.  Second, iTunes is the program used to convert to. Unless your MP3 player is an iPod you are out of luck in transfering to your MP3 player.  Lastly, When I hooked the converter turntable to my sound system to play records it ditn't work unlike my old turntable which worked just fine.

B000JQU1VS|4.0|I loved this book in and of itself. The Sherlock Holmes stories are all engaging and addicting! The downside to my download was that some of the words were messed up, especially when a character was talking about the currency pounds. It would turn the sign into a bunch of random punctuation marks. It distracted me greatly! I'll be buying this book as a physical copy soon!
B005L38QK2|4.0|I'll start by saying I'm not PC gaming expert but this mouse is great for me. I recently bought a new laptop here on Amazon and realized I could play some games on it really wanted to play Diablo 3 and Torchlight 1 & 2 (when released). Have a wireless mouse but started reading up and with lag they can affect your game so started to look at wired. I came across Steelseries who seems to be one of the top manufacture for PC gaming accessories. I'll break down my crude review into a few parts:<br /><br />Feel: The mouse is the perfect size for my hand and the side buttons are pretty comfortable. As a few reviewers mentioned the two right side ones can be awkward to get to but I'm getting the hang of it after just a few hours. The rubberized coating on the top is a great feel and doesn't get sticky on your palm after a few hours of use.<br /><br />Responsiveness: With multiple settings this mouse is accurate and very responsive.<br /><br />Durability: Can't say for the future but this seems to be crafted pretty well. The cord is a braided as description says.<br /><br />Look: Pretty solid for a mouse. I wasn't sure how it would look in person but it's nice I like the look and the blinking lights add a nice touch. You can adjust how fast it goes and the intensity. It does only glow red, which hey it's Diablo hell red is appropriate.<br /><br />That's a quick look at it from a novice point of view. If you like Diablo or just the design this is perfect for you.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Love the ability to download multiple translations. Good way to get your daily bible reading in. Overall, a very good app that I use every day.

B006IDG2T6|5.0|\\"Free Will\\" is a good and entertaining discussion of the age-old problem of free will vs. various forms of determinism which highlights the role that neurological experiments have contributed to the debate. It's not an exhaustive work, but it certainly covers a lot of ground and provides ample jumping-off points for future reading.<br /><br />I've read all of Harris' other books and any fan of his writing should read this one. But \\"Free Will\\" is also one of Harris' most approachable books for those who are either unfamiliar with his work or who take offense (as I don't) to his more polemical tone in, for example, \\"The End of Faith.\\" This is the second brief ebook on a single philosophical topic that he has published (the other being \\"Lying\\"). I find these very entertaining and hope there are more of them to come.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've played this game for hours. Quite enjoyable and easy to play. Makes the time go fast when your waiting.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|I was dazzled by the trailer for this movie and rushed out to buy it with the highest of expectations. Bottom line-if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best that this movie has to offer. Good acting, pretty impressive visual feel (similarities with 300), but lacks a compelling storyline, little suspense. (Spoiler warning) I loved the scences in the trailer with Theseus using that awesome bow, unfortunately, he hardly uses it in the movie and doesn't even have it in his possession very long. There's not actually that much fighting, the choreography is quite similar to 300 and not nearly as impressive the second time around. Some excessive brutality, creulty that I didn't like-elicited a shock effect, but didn't really add any value to the story.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Great game, though for further updates add beguile custamization like add parts or adlities like you get 2-3 cardads every run. Also add more maps.

B0052U59F4|5.0|I grabbed this off of the best seller list, and wasn't expecting a D/s novel.<br /><br />The first couple of chapters, I thought well this is interesting; and then, oh crap, it's going to be a Secretary/Wuthering Heights rip off. Guy flexes muscles, girl gasps and swoons.  Major psychological problems and severe childhood trauma!  Gimme a break.  So a few chapters in, I thought, eh, cheap fetish novel, probably won't finish it.<br /><br />But I was wrong.  The developing dynamics pull the novel over the rough spots, and very unlike Secretary, it does not cop out with a namby-pamby fairy tale when the real relationship starts.  This is more a story about learning to deeply trust, expanding what they think is possible in life, both individually, and as a couple.  How many of us let the real \\"me\\" out to our partners?  It illuminates how delicate the dance of living with expansive passion and bared souls is, no matter the flavor.  We don't know how it will end, because when love, honesty and trust define your life, it is impossible to see where it will take you.<br /><br />I hope that the next two novels are as lovely as the first.
B0071PS7AC|2.0|looks good, but when you can get 230+ with a straight ball something is wrong. (use 1/2 board right of Center board.)
B006ISJQBC|1.0|I have little to add to the one and two star rated reviews.  The film sucks.  It apparently rips off Nicholas Roeg's incredibly great film Performance (as in Performance, London Blvd has a rolls royce, a house in a dumpy area of London, a hero who's been in prison, a failed artists, etc).  But London Blvd is entirely banal.  You can see the ending coming an hour away.  William Monahan wrote the screenplay and directed.  It's quite an atrocious film.
055358894X|5.0|Why is this novel not being lauded more?! This book is fantastic and the story is entrancing. I read TONS of books and this one took me by surprise. There are rich and expansive characters, the city is a character unto itself and the staggered timeline makes for a great read. Anyone who is on the fence should just go for it and buy this book, buy this kindle or even download the audio version (which is well done by Michael Page).

Without unreasonably high expectations, the case is fascinating, the resolution is wholly unexpected and the reasons behind the whodunit are startling in their brilliance. Did the tone, descriptions and characters reflect Jane Austen?  Yes.  But she didn't have to explain so much from other Austen books as that slowed the action for a bit.  Did the mystery blinside me?  Almost entirely.<br /><br />I should say that there were great swathes in the middle where very little happened.  Elizabeth and Darcy just went about their business.....as everyone waited for the next step.  Neither of them were really three-dimensional, a significant failing for an author of Ms. James' skill.  On the other hand, for a rollicking, complex mystery and a picture of England in the Regency period, it's a pretty darned good read.
1451683405|3.0|Schopenhauer said  (in English translation, of course): You can do what you will, but you can't will what you will. This sentiment is paraphrased several times in Harris' little essay. A far better argument was offered by Dean Woolridge (without benefit of PET scans) in \\"Mechanical  Man,\\" 1969! I am disappointed. Harris is right, but this book lacks his customary intellectual vigor.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|When I first heard of a Phantom sequel, I was excited, but also had my doubts.  Phantom phans can be vicious and I knew that for some the idea of a sequel smacked of heresy.<br /><br />I immediately grabbed the London Recording and was enthralled by the music.  Beneath The Moonless Sky, Once Upon Another Time, and Till I Hear You Sing were amazing.  Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess were absolutely incredible and the entire piece resonated with me.<br /><br />The recording had a few miscues like Heaven By The Sea, but overall, I was entranced.<br /><br />The show hit with mixed to negative reviews and immediately underwent a rewrite.  It is the results of those rewrites that appears on this video.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that while the 2nd Act has remained largely unchanged, with the exception of the final scene.  The 1st Act, however, has been heavily modified.  The show starts off with Till I Hear You Sing, and completely excises Heaven By The Sea and a majority of the prologue.<br /><br />A central plot element is also tweaked.  In the original concept, Christine and Raoul are invited by Mr. Y (The Phantom) to perform.  The only \\"trick\\" the Phantom plays on the De Chagney's is in hiding his true identity.<br /><br />In the modified plot, Christine and Raoul are invited to New York by Oscar Hammerstein to perform at a new Opera House he is opening and they are \\"intercepted\\" at the pier by The Phantom's \\"freaks\\" and brought back to Phantasma.  Raoul is coaxed out of his room on the premise to meet Oscar in the bar downstairs.  This allows the Phantom to sneak into and confront Christine.  Christine is then \\"forced\\" to sing \\"Love Never Dies\\" due to a veiled threat the Phantom makes towards the safety of her son, Gustav after the end of \\"Once Upon Another Time\\".  This makes the Phantom a much darker character, delving, again into the darkness seen in the first show.  It's obvious that Erik has no problems murdering (including children I suppose) those who would thwart his plans.<br /><br />While this could be a bit more true to his character, it also makes him more schizoprenic.  In one scene he's threatening Gustav with bodily harm, and after he discovers Gustav's true parantage, he decides to leave \\"all that he has ever made\\" to his son.  This just comes across as too extreme.  The Phantom just seems to travel the whole emotional arc a bit too quickly.  In the original plot, the Phantom doesn't have to threaten Christine to get her to perform, so he doesn't quite have so far to travel from Dr. Mengele to Dr. Huxtable<br /><br />\\"Dear Old Friend\\" has also changed in tone.  I always saw this song in my minds eye as being sung through gritted teeth and forced smiles.  This is because in the original, Meg and Madam Giry seem to be well aware of Christines impending visit to Phantasma.  In the new version, Christine is not supposed to be there and Meg and Christine sort of bump into each other.  The song starts out very sincere and then changes in tone as each participant suspects they've been played, both by the Phantom and by each other.  I like watching the smiles change to grimaces as they perform their final toast.<br /><br />Overall the production values and filming of this show are fantastic.  The set design is amazing, especially during \\"The Beauty Underneath\\", and \\"Love Never Dies\\".<br /><br />The one weakness of the show is the fact that Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne are not Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess.  Yes, I know that is a shallow argument, but Karimloo and Bogness bring a fierceness and chemistry that literally leaps off the CD.  This chemistry is also apparant in their performance during the 25th Anniversary performance of Phantom Of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall.  Had this production had those two in it, this would have been a 5 star production in my mind.<br /><br />Lewis and O'Byrne are capable, but I never truly bought Lewis as the Phantom.  O'Byrne was much better as Christine, and her scene with Gustave in \\"Look With Your Heart\\" is brilliant.<br /><br />The other weakness is that this show never reaches the musical heights of the original CD.  Many people feel, including myself, that this is one of ALW's best scores, and it is truly showcased in the CD.  The score feels smaller in this production and not as glorious.  I understand changes were required to tweak the show.  And believe me, I don't grieve the loss of the painful \\"Heaven By The Sea\\".  But this show just never quite hit the heights of the original CD.<br /><br />Overall this is a great show and I am thrilled that ALW decided to give everyone a chance to view it.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is no \\"Phantom Of the Opera\\", but it is no \\"Starlight Express\\" either and that, as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing!
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|First of all I have read all that Jodi Picoult has written, I just love how she tells a story..<br />Second, I was unaware there was such a thing as music therapy.<br /> I would really recommend this book to anyone.  I'm always amazed how she takes a current headline and spin a tale and how it keep the reader in her grip. Jodi always keeps the element of suspence intense.

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I decided to read this book because I loved Something Borrowed so much.  When I read Something Borrowed, I completely detested Darcy and did not want to read book from her immature perspective.  Needless to say, I did not go into this book expecting to like it nearly as much as Something Borrowed.  However, I found this book enthralling.  I loved seeing Darcy mature as she learned to deal with the choices she made.  I went from completely hating Darcy to completely loving and admiring her.  The evolution of Darcy and Ethan's relationship is one of the most romantic, sweet love stories I have ever heard.

Fortyuantly Rebecca Hamilton is far from these feelings.<br /><br />From the moment you meet the main character you begin a dance through her world which paints pictures in your mind and takes you by the hand and leads you safely through.

B0064GKEXC|3.0|This six DVD set gathers most, but not all, of Vladimir Horowitz's filmed and videotaped performances.  The timeline for these performances is brief: 1982-1987 - along with a few snippets of Horowitz playing in 1974 for an abandoned documentary.  So, we only see Horowitz in the late stages of his career.<br /><br />Paradoxically, the earliest of these is the weakest.  Horowitz's May 22, 1982 recital from London's Royal Festival Hall (billed as A Royal Concert), is little short of a regal disaster.  Horowitz had recently begun taking the anti-depressants that would suspend his career in 1983, and it shows.  The Scarlatti Sonatas are lacking the grace he usually brought to these gems.  Both Chopin's Polonaise-Fantasie and G minor Ballade are fragmented, incoherent, and technically sub-par - the Ballade's coda is just plain banged.  There's little sense of childhood - even a memory of childhood - in the Kinderszenen, with fussed phrasing and drawn out ritardandos that border on the bizarre.  Only in the Rachmaninoff Sonata does the playing improve - although it's nowhere near the level of his 1968 and 1980 recordings.  To make matters worse, Horowitz looks as bad as he sounds: slack jawed facial expression, overweight to the extent his coat looks about to pop open, his lower teeth discolored to the point of blackness.  Even the interview (shown at Intermission but taped weeks earlier at the pianist's New York townhouse) shows a nearly incoherent pianist rambling along with stories of his childhood and early success.  By the way, this DVD includes all three of Horowitz's encores from that day - the last had been deleted from all previous VHS and LaserDisc issues.<br /><br />Given Horowitz's condition in 1982 and '83, it's all the more remarkable that he returned to playing in 1985.  The Last Romantic documentary, filmed by the Maysles brothers, was conceived as a way for the pianist to ease himself into performing without the stress of a big return concert.  Horowitz looks remarkably well here: relatively trim and vigorous (and free of that ridiculous comb-over he'd worn since the 1970s).  His playing is on a higher level than in London, although there are moments of caution in Chopin's B minor Scherzo and A-flat Polonaise.  The hand held camera work is often too close and shaky (ala Blair Witch Project) and becomes a distraction at times.  Incidentally, the 15 minutes of outtakes that was released in 2003 is not included here.<br /><br />Horowitz's 1986 return concert in Moscow was undoubtedly the high point in his career - at least in terms of publicity.  The pianist was performing in his native land for the first time since 1925, and thanks to technology, in front of an international audience of millions.  If there was any nervousness on Horowitz's part, it's not evident on this DVD.  Who can fail to be moved when Horowitz (unseen by the audience, but visible on television) gently pats his piano as if it were a beloved companion?  The audience's reaction to Horowitz's performance, some seen openly weeping, belies the contention that he was an emotionally uncommunicative performer.  The concert is shot-through with nostalgia, a commingling of joy and melancholy - all punctuated with virtuoso thrills remarkable for a pianist of any age, let alone an octogenarian.  This version includes all three of Horowitz encores, which was not always the case.<br /><br />Horowitz plays Mozart is another Maysles brothers documentary - this time of a recording session for the K. 488 Concerto with Carlo Maria Giulini and the La Scala Theater Orchestra.  In the course of the session, the concerto is covered in toto, and part of the finale is redone.  The behind-the-scenes look at the work that goes into making a classical recording, from tuning the piano, ironing out disagreements between soloist and conductor, and working the press, is enlightening.  In between takes, the pianist spends time mugging for the camera, flirting with his (male) page turner, and arguing with Wanda - some of which is embarrassing to watch.  Some moments are out of context: Just before the session, Horowitz removes his jacket and hands it to his manager, commenting \\"All my money is in here.\\"  Without reading Harold Schonberg's biography of Horowitz, none would know that the pianist's hotel room was robbed during the sessions, causing him to feel justifiably paranoid.<br /><br />Horowitz's May 1987 recital in Vienna's famed Musikverein was the second-to-last of his career - and the last visual document of his playing (he continued to record until 1989).  The sense of repose that marked his later playing is most in evidence here - particularly in the Andante of Mozart's K. 333 Sonata, and Schubert's G-flat Impromptu - a remarkable demonstration of Horowitz's ability to sustain a melodic line even at a slow tempo.  Schumann's Kinderszenen is remarkably simpler than the 1982 London performance, and more poetic by far.  Horowitz brings a sensual flirtatiousness to the middle section of Chopin's B minor Mazurka, while the octaves of the A-flat Polonaise are as bouncy as ever - if a bit slower.  Incidentally, there is no extra-musical program here: Horowitz simply walks on stage, performs his program, and leaves - to tumultuous applause, of course.<br /><br />1993's A Reminiscence will rekindle memories of all the familiar moments - the collaborations with Toscanini, the 1965 return to Carnegie Hall, the 1986 Moscow concert - but offers little that is new.  Aside from some grainy home movies and excerpts from an abandoned 1974 documentary, the footage of Horowitz duplicates the other DVDs in this set.  There are no interviews with other musicians, collaborators, or members of the Horowitz inner circle. The only figure shown, aside from Horowitz himself, is the pianist's widow, Wanda Toscanini Horowitz. She recites the usual anecdotes, prompted by an off camera Peter Gelb - Horowitz's manager during the 1980s. Hence, this doc is the ultimate inside job.  Wanda, who arguably knew Horowitz better than anybody, avoids delving into certain aspects of his non-musical life - she is even sketchy as to whether the pianist's 1953 crisis, which brought on a 12-year retirement from public performance, was a nervous breakdown, or colitis, or both. Other aspects of Horowitz's life, ranging from his homosexuality to the tragic fate of his Russian family (aside from his sister, no one in Horowitz's immediate family survived Stalin's reign), to his disastrous 1983 concerts are not mentioned at all.  There are a few moments of insight here, but one cannot escape the impression that this material was thrown together by Sony Classical for one purpose, to sell records.  Only the inclusion of a stunning performance of Scriabin's Vers la Flamme raises this doc above typical PBS fundraising fodder.  Another disappointment: the performance of Chopin's Introduction and Rondo that was included as a bonus on the VHS and LD issues in the 1990s is not included here.<br /><br />Now to the question on the minds of many Horowitz collectors: Does the picture quality of this set improve upon previous issues? On balance, I have to say NO - and in some cases, it looks worse. The Pioneer DVD issues of The Last Romantic and Moscow concert were head and shoulders above this issue. The Last Romantic and Mozart Concerto documentaries (which were shot on film) look very grainy and washed out - it's obvious the producers did not go back to the original film elements but used an existing tape copy. The Mocsow looks identical to the Sony DVD issue (not to be confused with the superior, Pioneer issue - which was unfortunately missing the final encore) which looks like it came from a 2nd generation videotape. The Vienna concert is curious: The picture alternates between the high quality seen on the DG DVD, and a fuzzy version seen whenever Horowitz begins a piece. I suspect this is the result of an effort to delete the blue title cards seen on the DG issue (although a German title card can be seen for Mozart's Rondo in D major).  There is a continual problem with \\"interline twitter\\" which is most evident during close-ups of VH's hands.  The only exception to the above is the London concert (which has been previously issued on VHS and LD, but never DVD). The picture is noticeably improved here - much better contrast and sharpness. Even the sound has been made more palatable than the clattery original.<br /><br />Another small nit: Whatever language I pick for the main menu, the disc defaults to German subtitles - easily correctable with a few flicks of the remote.<br /><br />So, on balance, this is the typical half-hearted (but full priced) job we've come to expect from Sony. The packaging, with excellent liner notes by Jed Distler, is certainly nice.  But with the poor picture quality, it amounts to lipstick on a pig.  I would not recommend this for those who already have these in other formats. For a newcomer to Horowitz,  perhaps this should be considered if the price drops.te inside job.

B006YTTVHO|3.0|I read one review that sounded like, \\"if you've been alive for a few years you won't need this book\\".  Something about being raised with wolves, etc.  Even if you're good with people this book is a good refresher.  Before retiring I spent my working life dealing with people and was very successful in this regard, even with the most difficult and demanding, but I still enjoyed the book.  It's a short and easy read.  But, beware of the part where the author suggests downloading his free audio.  It's just a come-on to purchase.  His web site address takes you to a page where you must enter your email address to gain access to the download, but then you're doused with all kinds of information designed to reach into your wallet.  I didn't download the \\"free\\" audio.
B006GHA9VQ|1.0|This review is not necessarily based on the plot of LND itself but more on the poor style of filming and editing used.  LND was not filmed it the style of the recent 25th Aniversary Phantom at the Royal Albert Hall special.  THe RAH Phantom recording still gave you a wonderful sense of spectacle where as this did not.<br /><br />In watching LND at a movie theater, there was no sense of grandeur or the theatrical experience due to the closely cropped facial shots.  The cinematic director relied far too heavily on close ups and, frankly, it made me feel like I was watching a poorly directed soap opera.<br /><br />And when I say close ups, I mean \\"count the performer's nose hair\\" close and that's no joke.<br /><br />I wanted to see how the sets moved and the overall choreography in some scenes, especially the quintet at the end with the Phantom, Raoul, Mme Giry, Meg and Gustav.  Instead the film kept jumping back and forth to faces.  And nostrils.<br /><br />The performaces were fantastic even if I didn't care for the rehash of the plot from Phantom of the Opera.  Like comparing Coney Island to the Paris Opera House, Love Never Dies felt cheap and easy rather than rich and filling.<br /><br />The DVD and Blu-Ray may be edited differently, so it may be worth a rental but unless you're a true fanatic and simply must collect all things Phantom, I'd advise you to stick with the cast recording and your own imagination rather than purcahse this.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Since others have already said it all as far as what the story is all about I'll just add my vote here that I love this movie and think it deserves five stars and more. Once hits all the right notes in creating a feel that you are watching life unfold for the two characters that become friends and musically more. To me it seemed so very real, even more so than a documentary.<br /><br />I shared this movie with my college age children and they really enjoyed it as well. The soundtrack is stunning and definitely worth owning if you enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B004ZNARH4|5.0|I'll give the box set a 5 star review, because if your a huge fan of Pink Floyd you'll truly appreciate the high resolution 5.1 mixes.  That being said, I am warning other people who buy this box set, Amazon would not allow me to contact EMI to replace Discs #3 and #4 which were loose and of course scratched (same problem repeated over and over).  They instead overnighted me a new one, which had Disc #1 loose and scratched.  I ended up just putting all the scratched ones into one box set and shipping it back (free from Amazon, but you gotta get it to the PO).  I would've preferred just getting #3 and #4 directly from EMI which by reading other reviews is what some people experienced, but apparently Amazon won't do it anymore.  Keep it in mind if your on the fence on buying this.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I absolutely love paranormal, supernatural, fantasy novels and new author, Rebecca Hamilton did something I have never seen before in this particular genre. She found something different to pull into the ever growing YA/NA fantasy world (although I am sure that it is actually considered NA because of the wonderful sex scene between Sophia and her sexy shifter) and for that I applaud her!<br /><br />Using the elements of earth, water, fire, air and spirit, she combined these with creatures of the supernatural, the paranormal and Romanian Mythology. Her shifters were Strigoi and could transform into almost anything, her vampires were called the Cruor and there were even these beady-eyed little children wise beyond their years called the Chibold. With all that going on she through in some Wicca as well! I have never read anything with Wiccan characters and I was really impressed with her use of all of these elements. They tied together so nicely, its great to see something new pop out of a genre so heavily populated.<br /><br />While I enjoyed Sophia, the protagonist with the every pressing static in her head she so wishes to rid, I found that she seemed a little weak. (For those who don't know, I love of a strong female heroin) Now, it wasn't that the writing was weak or that the voice wasn't there. It was and the writing was great! I just felt that for a girl who was pointed at, out casted, called a witch and whispered about behind her back, that she should have had a tougher shell.<br /><br />Charles. Ahhh Charles. Beautiful, sexy, protective, and a shifter. What isn't there to love? Of course I loved Charles! My only complaint was how he waffles back and forth with Sophia. Yes, there had to be that tension of should they / shouldn't they, but I found he came on too strong too quick and the repetitious dance of `almost's' was a little too much. I think perhaps the tension might have been greater were he to put up the barrier a little longer, despite how lonely he seemed to be.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton has a wonderful voice and captured Sophia beautifully, she left just enough hints and / or questions to keep me turning the page. The ending was really good, questions I still had about Adrian, Charles and his parents were all tied together in a nice little bow, with just enough string hanging to keep me snagged for the next book in the series. There is a part of me that is skeptical, perhaps hopeful, that Charles still has some skeletons in his closet. It would make for a great conflict in the books to follow!<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton put a twist on the vastly growing genre and created a new world for us paranormal lovers to enjoy. I will definitely follow the series to see just what might happen next!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This film is a must see for everyone. Most people do not know what was taking place with the financial markets and what came to a head in 2008. People often comment on events in this country or the individuals at the top without any true knowledge. This puts it out there. Frightening thing is most of it is still taking place and there isn't much the average person can do about it.
0307454568|4.0|After being beaten up by the phenomenal \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" I was a little disappointed, or more accurately lost in a way. I definitely think this is still wonderful work and can hardly say there is any better way to conclude the trilogy.  But I think some points get in a way because there are many sub-plots, some of which are loosely tied to the main plot, Salander story.<br /><br />So far I have been kind of critical but I don't mean that this isn't worth reading. My primary attitude is still, \\"You should read this.\\"<br /><br />What most struck me in this last section of the sequel is the Salander trial, especially Gianini's presence in this story. At Gianini's first appearance I was slightly backed off as I felt it too convenient for the author to use Blomkvist's sister as another key figure. Isn't it unrealistic that the main character's sister \\"happens to be a lawyer\\" ? However as I went on to read Gianini's part turned out so powerful that it didn't bother me at all. I'd say this is one of the best trial scene in literature.<br /><br />I liked the episode about Berger in SMP. It was quite intriguing so I couldn't help thinking how it would go even when I was't reading the book. Only one complaint to this part is, this episode is too interesting to be a mere subplot accompanying one bigger story.<br /><br />Finally, about the ending, I liked it, period. There's nothing more I can put into words. Just read it yourself and you'll know how good I felt by reading the last two pages.<br /><br />P.S.<br />I talked with my friend about the way Blomkvist being a womanizer, and we concluded, \\"we can tell it's definitely written from male POV.\\"

0553801473|1.0|Trying to stay motivated so I could finish this book wasn't easy. Where the first three in the series took me only a week or two to finish each, it was very different with books 4 and 5. It turned into a chore. We have Tyrion spending the whole book traveling to meet Dany...and not getting there. We have Victarion making the same journney.... he doesn't get there either. Does Dany, the great dragon queen, make any effort at all in reaching Westros and retaking the seven kingdoms? She does not, even though it was the most important goal for her. She seems content enough screwing around in Meereen not accomplishing anything while acting like some stupid teenage girl that fawns over the irrelevant Daario.<br /><br />I thought maybe in this book Jon Snow would fight or at least learn more about the others and the white walkers. You know, only the most important aspect of the whole Ice and Fire series. But not this book everyone. No, we get treated to wildings, lots and lots of wildings. They move from one side of the wall to the other side. That's it.<br /><br />I had great hopes for things i'd like to see in this series. Wouldn't it be awsome if Dany used her dragons fight all those undead \\"others\\" with the help of Jon Snow and the Night's Watch in some epic battle? Well after reading ADWD and AFFC i'm not keeping my hopes up for any fulfilling ending to the once great Ice and Fire series.

B000A6T1JU|5.0|The issue of director's cut vs theatrical release has been ably battled in the comments so I won't rehash what has been said. I did have the opportunity to meet David Patrick Kelly (Luther) when he was in my town for a film festival. I sat in on an interview with him and he attended a showing of the director's cut where he took questions after the show. Kelly understands that there are strong feelings about the theatrical release but thinks that the director's cut is good in its own right and reinforced that it represents the director's vision. I figure if it is good enough for Kelly who is responsible for one of the best lines uttered in a film it is good enough for me.<br /><br />For the record, I watched the theatrical release twice before seeing the director's cut for the first time. While I love the original version, the changes in the director's cut did not lessen that love for the film. I was still gripped, excited, and thrilled.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Amazing acting, make-up  and costume.  The Iron Lady teaches us what \\"Leadership\\" is......like her or hate her, \\"Maggie\\" was a leader and we need more people like her today.people with conviction and the ability to stand up and lead.........Do not miss this film......

B002T44ZYW|5.0|I was an avid follower of Lauren Conrad since her days on Laguna Beach. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw she was writing and I must say, I LOVE her books. After the first book I just had to read the second and I am currently waiting on the third book to come in.. I absolutely couldn't put down the first or the second book. Lauren is an extremely talented person, being able to have her life filmed for years while going to school and launching a clothing line in Kohl's and now writing amazing books. I will continue to buy her books. They are as intriguing (if not more) as the Hills which I am completely hooked on.. I would recommend to anyone who was a follower of Laguna Beach and the Hills and is on team Lauren :)
B001NFNFNU|3.0|The plot is engaging and one develops an interest in the outcome and the characters.  A captivating historic glimpse of the time period is an attractive feature.  The events are based upon a true story.  However, the power and abuse of the psychiatric profession are grossly exaggerated.  Shock treatments in reality were not used as punishment.  The patient had to have an empty stomach.  Thus, ECT was scheduled for early morning before breakfast to prevent choking. Placing patients in isolation was done only to prevent them from harming themselves or others.  Restraining a person required extra manpower and there is little motivation to do needless work.<br /><br />Still, this fictional portrayal offers an informative warning about the potential for the abuse of power in a Therapeutic Police State. It also shows the powerful role clergy can play when they speak out against injustice.<br /><br />The script lacks comic relief and the soundtrack is mediocre.  Angelina Jolie's heavy makeup at times makes her look more like a cartoon than a human.<br /><br />The redeeming features of this show make it worth watching.

B0050SRZOQ|5.0|I have been an honest watcher of Smallville through all the seasons and a pretty much overall tv addict. I can say that this is one of the few shows that ends on top with their best season and goes out with their best episode of all time. This episode hits all the heavy hitters brilliantly and Clark is able to finally grasp his destiny. Lois and Clark continue thier sparkage. Chloe remains a character everyone's heart has room for. Oliver is saved and will always have that certain guy swag that every guy wishes he had. The Kents and Lioneel get their last spotlight. And my personal favorite..Lex is back and has embraced the villian role. He even sports the White suit as the President. The writers and producers wrote it, the actors brought it, and the tights came out. A truly epic ending to an epic show that will be remembered forever.

B001BANK32|2.0|The movie, in this case, is much, much better than the book, which is obviously rarely the case. What we have here is a good idea by King that was ultimately shaped into a powerful story by Kubrick and his fellows. The so-called lost nuances were lost for a reason -- they are weaknesses in the storyline or are faults within the characters that inhabit it. But anyone who is familiar with early King should not be surprised by this. It took quite some time for his stories to evolve beyond being simply good ideas that would be very good novels if shaped by a more experienced author. To mention just a few examples of the flaws in the story Kubrick fixed: the mallet Jack uses becomes an axe, his boy exhibits a more realistic helplessness, and the absurd hedge monsters and wasp imagery that are present in the book as secondary sources of terror are gotten rid of. The book also tries to present what is happening in Jack's mind as he goes insane, and fails miserably -- very poor writing. Then there is the author flinching at the end of the narrative, which lessens its impact on the reader quite a bit: Jack is The Overlook at the end, not himself, not Danny's father (this is stated explicity), and he does not kill the cook, but only maims him. Kubrick recognized that the truly frightening idea here is not a haunted hotel taking possession of a human body, but a haunted hotel driving a more or less normal man insane.

0811877485|3.0|I like the way that these decals look. They are a wonderful size, great colors, and really adorable. However, they are not staying applied. I followed the directions and waited a few weeks after painting before I applied the decals. I carefully applied them and used a flat edge tool to smooth them out. Yet months later I am still having to press down the edges every few weeks to keep them applied. Additionally, if you do not get these placed exactly as you want them, they are not very easy to reposition. I purchased Wild Things decals at the same time and found them much easier to work with.
B006ZBRMOU|3.0|I really struggled to finish this, I have to be honest. As well as the juvenile writing style many have commented on in reviews of the first two books, this book suffers from a particularly acute lack of plot.<br /><br />There is an attempt at a plot; \\"someone\\" (and it was immediately apparent who the someone was, right from the first time it was made apparent that someone was sabotaging Grey's aircraft towards the end of Fifty Shades Darker.<br /><br />The narration is very \\"I said this, then he did that,\\" and as intriguing as Christian Grey is as a character, he can't carry this book entirely on his own.<br /><br />What made Fifty Shades of Grey brilliant was the narration which say Ana really struggle to come to terms with Christian's dominant side. That was completely absent from the second book, and from this one. The dom/sub power relationship is completely absent from this book. Christian is as domineering and obsessive as ever, but that's not the same thing.<br /><br />There is something strange going on in this trilogy about food. Christian is obsessed with making sure Ana eats properly because he went hungry as a child, going so far as to list foods she can and can't eat in a contract. Ana, on the other hand, more or less refuses to eat throuhgout the books, and in this one is \\"full\\" and can eat no more after a mouthful of wine, a forkful of lamb and a bit of pita bread and hummus. People around her are concerned by how skinny she has become, but she likes it, and continues to barely eat. Weird? Is this just me? I eat like a horse. I'm never not eating. Even as I sit here writing this, I'm eating.<br /><br />Ana constantly refers to pajama bottoms and jeans hanging from Christian's hips \\"in that way\\". What way? Anything below Ana's waist is \\"down there\\". The juvenile writing style I thought might be deliberate now seems to be an unhappy accident.<br /><br />Ana has become more or less entirely subservient. Christian buys Ana something/does something/says something, Ana says he shouldn't have, Christian says he wanted to, Ana pouts, they have sex, and Ana accepts it. It's boring, repetitive and annoying.<br /><br />There is absolutely no backstory at all in these books, which is fine for me because I read all three in three or four days, but generally, not a good idea.<br /><br />This book ends in the most boring, run of the mill, traditional way, and after Fifty Shades of Grey, was a a real disappointment.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I wanted something to enable me to quickly do specific tasks within various programs, whether it be scrolling, zooming, switching between 20 open files, etc. I decided to get this and try it out, and it works perfect for my needs. The software interface is simple, and you use it to program how the knob works on a per-program basis. I use this for a variety of programs so my review isn't touching on specific programs, but I'll go over the highlights and some tech stuff.<br /><br />The Driver Issues:<br /><br />Folks are having what they believe to be driver issues, but there's a misconception here. This hardware doesn't come with or need any \\"driver\\" which Windows doesn't already have. Specifically, the powermate uses HIDUSB.SYS which is a default Windows driver for all Human Interface Devices, such as mice, trackballs, keyboards, etc.. Aside from this default OS driver, the only thing the powermate requires is the program itself (along with the plugins it comes with), which runs as a memory-resident program.<br /><br />What might be occuring is the program may not function well with Windows 7, I haven't tried it yet on my Windows 7 system. However, what I believe is most likely the actual problem, is how Windows 7 uses HID USB devices, as it's a smidge different from XP. There's a different level of security intepretation when software is run. I will update the review once I test this on Windows 7, but as a general rule of thumb, try this:<br /><br />* Run the powermate program (powermate.exe) in Administrator Mode (right-click, choose Run as Administrator..)<br /><br />* Make sure the powermate is plugged into a usb2/3 port which has full power available, you can always try a different port (don't use USB extension cables!)<br /><br />More to follow..<br /><br />Software Flexibility:<br /><br />You have the ability to turn the knob, press it down, or turn it while pressing it down, and the software allows you to also handle \\"holding\\" the button for a period of time. This gives you a total of 6 possible functions per program, as well as 6 \\"global\\" (default) functions. You can adjust the sensitivity response of the knob turning, so it responds faster/slower compared to how fast you turn it, as well as the length of time before the \\"hold\\" (long click) action kicks in.<br /><br />The software allows you to have many additional powermate knobs attached to your computer simultaneously, each of them programmable this way. Whether you have 1 powermate or 255, you can configure certain settings on each one individually, such as how the blue LED reacts, and whether that specific knob is going to use all possible program settings, or will only respond to global default settings.<br /><br />Actions:<br /><br />For each knob function you can choose from a series of different actions:<br /><br />iTunes<br />Mouse<br />Open File<br />Power<br />Scrolling<br />Send Keys<br />Volume<br /><br />They should be easy to understand. Volume controls volume, Send Keys allows you to setup a key sequence, Open File opens a file, etc.. Each of these actions has a breakout menu with more specific choices, and/or specific settings such as sensitivity.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Inexpensive<br />* Simple to setup & use<br />* Works with practically any program<br />* 6 possible functions, many actions<br />* Ability to program 'keypresses'<br />* Adjustable sensitivity<br />* Can use multiple units with one piece of software<br />* Does not need additional drivers<br />* The blue LED can be turned off<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not heavy enough for my taste, it's about 100g, but could benefit from weighing a lot more.. 500+<br />* No ability to set time delays on the 'key press' function<br />* Windows 7 functionality is questionable<br /><br />OTHER THOUGHTS:<br /><br />For someone who wants an extra button with some added features, this is perfect, and will work with almost any program or software environment. If you want more than 6 functions, perhaps something with multiple button presses and that measures angles, you might want to look for a more professional device which can be found for under $100.
B0000013G9|5.0|This really is a modern day classic. This group and particularly this album are arguably the reason that groups like Destiny's Child formed. The one unique thing about TLC that separates them from any groups that followed them was their edge and staying on top of important issues.<br /><br />\\"Crazysexycool\\" is more than just it's singles (Creep, Waterfalls, Red Light Special etc). This is one of the few albums that you can listen to the whole way through without skipping songs (there are a couple interludes that didn't do a lot however). They have the right mix of beautiful harmony and street smarts here and it balances out perfectly. The overall theme of the album is sexuality but underneath that veil is the message that women need to be strong, society needs to be repaired, and how to deal with broken relationships.<br /><br />They covered Prince's song, \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\" on here and made it sound like it was their own and that is no easy task. Some of the interludes are actually kind of cool and go with the flow of the album. The interlude where they mock Puff Daddy is great (being that I can't stand Puffy).<br /><br />They only got better with their next album \\"Fanmail\\", but this one I would have to say is the best one they ever made. This is good music and should not be overlooked.<br /><br />Buy this if you don't own it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|use this app daily. It's like having my office cpu on any of my android  devices.... (Asus Transformer Prime/HTC Evo 3D)  App works flawlessly!
B000068VHQ|5.0|The Cranberries never really could fit into one musical genre and that's one of the best things about them. Their music is unorthodox and so are they. Anyone looking to give them a try should know that the lead singer's voice isn't for everyone (I would compare it to you either love Bjork's voice or hate it). If you get past that, they are amazing songwriters and the lyrics are extremely powerful.<br /><br />I haven't heard an album by the Cranberries yet that didn't grab me on some emotional level along with being extremely special. This album is known for \\"Zombie\\" but there really isn't a bad track on here. Comparisons or sounds I could relate this album to are Irish folk ballads, Cocteau Twins, a little bit of My Bloody Valentine, and traditional rock. That was really reaching to throw out those categorizations.<br /><br />The bottom line is that you should buy this album and their other albums because they are all special in their own way.
B002BWP49M|4.0|I have loved the Twilight series movies, although I am glad I read the books first. There is so much in a good book, and these are FANTASTIC books, that is hard to portray in a movie.<br />I think each movie has been better than the last, which is usually unheard of. But Breaking Dawn Part I was beyond my expectation. The make-up was superb, the acting was definitely much more professional and the overall feeling of the movie was very enjoyable.<br />I would recommend to anyone that may have been put off by any of the first three movies, try Breaking Dawn Part I, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!<br />Wonderful viewing to all, and a great week.
B000002VMD|4.0|I loved the movie and I love this sound track album. Whitney really shows not only her talent as an actress, but also blew me away with her beautiful voice. I loved all her vocals on this sound track as I know you will too! I was so heartbroken when I heard the news of her passing at such a young age. God's choir has gained a beautiful singer, and we have lost one. They'll never be another Whitney Houston. No one can compare to her, or her beautiful voice. She was so very talented. So pick up your copy today of The Body Guard Original sound track, you will not be disappointed. Yours truly Garry E. Lewis<br />[[ASIN:B000002VMD The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album]]
B0074JODP8|5.0|Right now I'm recording KQED's (PBS in the San Francisco Bay Area) broadcast of Joe Bonamassa's Beacon theatre - Live from New York.  It's my custom to not watch it while it's recording but I jumped in just when Joe was starting Mountain Time.  I still haven't heard all of it, it doesn't matter. I'm on Amazon and now I'll have the DVD in a matter of days.  I own everything he has ever done and I really didn't think he could play a better rendition of Mountain Time; I was so wrong.  Buy this DVD, play it till your ears ring with his music, I will.  He is absolutely, positively, the best.
B005WGBQ9G|2.0|Just watched the first episode of season 2 and just like season 1 this show seems to be pretty boring as far as plot and acting go. The ending to the first episode was probably the dumbest 2 minutes I have ever watched on TV. Why on god's blue earth would the two men just let the boy walk towards the deer? Why? Why would that happen in reality? And then the boy gets shot by another hunter! You have to be kidding me. This will be the last I watch of this series.

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is honestly one of the best books i have ever read - and i have read quite a lot of books. It is so far my favorite John Green book too. I laughed a lot, cried, and learned valuable lessons about life. Currently, i am convincing every single person i know who loves to read like i do to read this book. Even if you don't enjoy reading (....what is wrong with you), if you read this book i feel that you will change your mind.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love this program to be able to save memory's is priceless and music clips along with pictures then be able to share it... luv it
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I just finished the omnibus.  As a whole I enjoyed the book.  I have a rule.. no book less than 300 pages.  That means I would not have bought the books one by one.  I was plesently suprised.  The author created a beliveable world.  I am looking forward to more in this seris.  But, dear author... try for at least 300 pages!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is hard but really fun. the only thing I didn't like about it is that some of the games are like impossible. over all its a good game.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I had never read anything like it.  A thrilling erotic story of a damaged man finding an innocent girl and rocking both their worlds.  At times it's slightly disturbing trying to come to grips with the behavior of the characters but that is exactly what makes it exciting.  Its a fantasy world that I would never wish to enter but loved being a voyer in.  This book definelty opened up my mind.  It is stricly fantasy and the relationships would never actually be like this in real life.  But, reading about a deeply disturbed man and a very innocent girl find their way was what made it so much fun.  The second and third books in this series are just as good.  Just this morning I listned to a TV personality doctor warn that this series was taking women's rights backwards with its message, but I have to say he's a guy and he just doesn't get it.  It was liberating to read it not a throw back to old times.  I found myself allowing myself to fall into the fantasy rather than being put down by it.  If this author continues to write books like this I will sign up for a lifetime subscription.
B000KG499M|5.0|I bought 2 of these for my nephew who has fallen in love with Gundam models, I have to admit they are fun. Just one of the master grade Gundams has more parts and joint articulation than 20 of the old air plane and car models I did as young teen. Also I like the no glue needed aspect of it. I can't give it high marks for fun since it is just a stand used to hold models.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This film was really solid and I enjoyed seeing it at the theatre and on DVD. However, I will add one proviso: it can be a little frightening for young ones. They can be frightened by some of it, so make sure they are old enough to handle it (closer to 5 than 2, for example). Otherwise, a great film!
B0063IH60K|5.0|downloaded this game very first night &amp; play it faithfully. I definately recommend this game to anyone who likes to play solitaire
B005K2Z5IA|4.0|Does just what it says it does, holds and protects a Kindle. It will not carry a light, which is no big deal for me personally, but may be to someone else. The only quibble I have is the sleeve is very bulky where the flap folds over, as there are three layers of padded fabric right there. I'm happy with it, and I love the green and gray color scheme on the one I purchased.
B0072GPQ72|4.0|Most of us have read about dogs that after a distant separation from their human families, find their way back home. There are also cinematic versions. I recall \\"Homeward Bound: An Incredible Journey\\", and a Lassie film from the 1940's and I think Rin-Tin-Tin; but that might have been TV. In any case, director Steven Spielberg ups the ante, this time with a horse named Joey.<br /><br />An English farmer, out of spite for his landlord (David Thewlis), buys a young horse at an auction. He needed a larger horse for purposes of plowing but was a wee bit tipsy at the time. The son, Albert (Jeremy Irvine) raises the horse that is unusually smart, strong and sociable. Eventually, in need of cash, the father (Peter Mullan) sells the horse to a young army officer (Tom Hiddleston) at the dawn of World War I. Spielberg then sets events in motion that follow Joey and his fellow horse through numerous battles, arduous labor, escapes and engagements with English and German armies and French farmers. Aided by longtime partner, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg paints a beautiful portrait of landscapes, sunrises and sunsets.<br /><br />The film does stretch believability at times. Would a horse volunteer for duty to pull a canon up a hill in place of a fellow horse? It also would have made more sense to have Germans speak German and French speak French but I guess subtitles over even small sections of film would scare off some audiences. This is old fashion movie making and even with some bleak battle scenes and animal mistreatment, will attract families. Sure it's sentimental and even cheesy at times, but it has a strong moral foundation and it ultimately uplifting.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc is of course a 1080p conversion.  It has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio which makes the spectacular cinematography really shine.  The audio comes in the form of DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 24 bit surround, so those with a serious home theater system will be rewarded.
B004SRWW0C|5.0|Having my phone flashed with CyanogenMod, I bought this app. With it, I'm able to write sound files to the internal memory for ringtones. Sure you can do it on the SD card, but when the SD card is mounted, the sound files cannot be read for obvious reasons. That was the main reason for buying this app, so if you're in the same situation, buy it! Just make sure to change the r/o to r/w option at the top when moving stuff to internal memory.
B002AF4Y96|3.0|This polarizing Oliver Stone movie really got the MPAA ratings board in an uproar when it was scheduled for release.  They assigned it an NC-17 tag due to the excessive violence, gore, sex, profanity and the like.  It was eventually cut enough to get an R but remained highly controversial.  Critics pretty much lined up on the side of brilliant satire or loathsome glorification of violence.  Here we get the unrated version and even a perverse cut scene involving Ashley Judd (special features).<br /><br />Mickey (Woody Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) are a couple of misfits in love with each other and the power of killing people in cold blood.  They were both abused as children as we learn in flashbacks and a sit-com (complete with laugh track) fantasy.  I guess Stone and his writers (David Veloz for the script and Quentin Tarantino for the story) put this in to make the natural born killers somewhat sympathetic.  What makes this film different from a similarly violent \\"True Romance\\" which came out a year earlier, is that many if not most of the victims are random and completely innocent in \\"NBK.\\"<br /><br />Satire involves humor, often subtle but there are some over-the-top moments that strike that cord.  For example the fantasy sit-com which involves the laugh track responding enthusiastically when Mallory's father (real comedian Rodney Dangerfield) abuses his daughter.  The juxtaposition of the laughing is humorous, but the vile father isn't.  M & M get more notoriety as they advance their murder spree to the point of it becoming fodder for a national TV show headed by reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.).  Like terrorists, M & M want credit for their carnage and Gale is willing to give it to them.<br /><br />Once captured, M & M aren't finished as they create chaos in prison thanks to a clueless warden (Tommy Lee Jones) and Gales TV production.  \\"NBK\\" certainly satirizes television's fascination with violence (if it bleeds it leads) but truly piles on.  It also pokes fun at criminals and crime fighters alike, but I wonder how many bad guys watch this movie and \\"get it.\\"  Stone throws every trick in the book in the production of this film.  Some of the movie is in color, some scenes are in black and white.  While most of the film is 35 mm, some is video tape and super 8.  He uses fantasy, newsreels and animation.  He even manages to toss in a few references to his JFK conspiracy theory.  So where do I stand?  Right down the middle.  If you can handle the violence and have an appreciation for dark comedy and satire, put this on your list.  If you're the least bit squeamish, skip it.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is excellent but does have variations due to the different formats Stone uses in the movie mix.  The Dolby TruHD is likewise excellent.  Near the film's conclusion a huge prison riot occurs and the chaos explodes from all the speakers which adds to the effect.  Great soundtrack by the way.It also pokes fun at criminals and crime fighters alike, but I wonder how many bad guys watch this movie and \\"get it.\\"  Stone throws every trick in the book in the production of this film.

B006UG90RM|3.0|I was really excited about getting this album. I had heard it was a \\"back to basics\\" album for VH, with Roth back at the mic. As a person that owns every DLR/VH album on vinyl I'm expecting good stuff...Meh.<br /><br />First of all, most of the tracks feel like tunes that just didn't make the cut back in the day. It all feels like \\"B-side\\" bonus material for a box set, i.e. not the meat and potatoes, not even dessert, more like after dinner coffee.<br /><br />DLR's voice still sounds good but the talky/sing-songy-voiceover of random lines is a little over played. Although a signature of his time, it seems forced like he's TRYING to be old DLR. Eddie's guitar is uninspired, no innovation and I didn't ever get that \\"Eddie tore it up\\" moment.<br /><br />One thing that is really missing, and I'm sorry for anyone in denial but, Michael Anthony's soaring background vocals; this IS an integral part of the VH sound. He added that extra ummph that anyone familiar with the full VH catalog would recognize as missing here.<br /><br />As other have stated before, the production on this album is bad. I can't believe they would let some of the issues go out like that. Noticeable choppiness, noticeable miscues, and the overall dynamics are horrible...the flatness can be heard by even the untrained ear.<br /><br />In some ways, I almost wish DLR and VH had never broken up so we could have seen them evolve as a band. Instead, we have a DLR trying to be what he was, with Eddie cashing a 30 year-old check. Instead of having a true-thru-the-years VH sound making new music, we have an old band trying to recapture magic and it just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />For the Van-Halen-can-do-no-wrong people, this will be fine. For me, this is a fair album at best.
0446585025|2.0|I was so excited to read this book. I love Ellen, have always found her stand up and jokes funny, but was really disappointed with this book. I laughed a few times at the beginning, but that was it. I actually found myself skipping pages.

B001UGB1X8|2.0|I have read several novels by James Lee Burke; none were especially good, but rather average--in its own way average is a compliment since most novels, mystery or otherwise, are really mediocre, if not just plain execrable. This movie is lifted with almost complete fidelity from his novel and the movie suffers from a stasis in which the plot moves forward not at all or slowly. Tommy Lee Jones acts as if his questionable charisma is all that is needed to make a film work well. The lack of any forward propulsion of the plot in many scenes in the movie is frustrating for the viewer. The first half-hour, which should \\"hook\\" us into watching the film, is a non-starter: slow and boring. Back to Jones for one final comment: he has acted well in some movies, most particularly No Country For Old Men. But in this film he has a solid and credible context in which to act out his character. It doesn't hurt that this film is very good, largely because it is faithfully based on a novel by the profoundly good novelist Cormac MacCarthy.<br />  Ultimately, a movie must be judged by narrative success (a movie is not a static painting or sculpture).  In this regard, the movie must inexorably be judged a failure. It is shallow and will<br />disappoint viewers who want to be drawn into a movie that has something to say.

0307279189|3.0|I was not pleased with McDougall's rants about how bad shoe companies are considering that he now endorses a company in Vibram. The story is a great read for runners of all abilities and backgrounds - however, you can tell that McDougall seems to exaggerate some of his descriptions to be more dramatic.  It is no wonder this book is so popular in running clubs and at the gym. The guy has promoted himself up to the top using star ultra runners like Scott Jurek and Jenn Shelton. McDougall himself is not much of a runner though and that Barefoot Ted seems to get way too much attention and praise. Just my 2 cents.

0525478817|3.0|Yes, I was stunned at how fluent John Green is with what it's like to be dying, in particular, from cancer.  He is on-the-money about it, and Yes, this is a brave, bold book, with amazing writing--truly amazing.  But wait, everyone--there are major problems with the book and I'm getting the idea John Green might be too big and the idea that his boundary-breaking (using sick kids as main characters) is too sensitive a topic for critics to find any fault in these stars. I get it if that's true, but let's really look at the book. First why is Gus so immediately and so intensely attracted to Hazel?  I kept waiting for there to be some kind of edge attached to it.  Sure, she looks like his ex-girlfriend, but he simply falls too hard, too fast.  Okay, I overlooked this because I loved Hazel and wanted  her to have some happiness and I loved Gus. I was even happy with Green's understanding of girl-ness in Hazel. And I liked the dialogue, even though at some point all of the characters seemed to talk the same way and I stopped being able to tell them apart. I still loved Hazel and Gus and Isaac.  I love reading John Green because he's so smart and funny.  But his editors were too easy on him, and I think the critics of this book are, too.  The Imperial Affliction parts and all of the scenes with Peter Van Houten are plot devices that don't quite work. In fact, the last time Houten shows up in the book, I thought maybe Hazel was imagining it--like it was some kind of dark humor.  (But it wasn't. It was just ridiculous.) Here's another example:  two dying kids having their first kiss in Anne Frank's house?  When the crowd applauds it's almost as if John Green is clapping because he thought up something so symbolic and ironic. These two have just been through a major disappointment--so they go sightseeing? With the housekeeper? To Anne Frank's house? And even though mobility and fatigue are major problems in their getting around the house, they still can't fight off the need to kiss? I was troubled by this book because I came to love Hazel's affection for Gus and the other story elements got in the way of that.  The characters are well drawn, compelling people, but the plot around them is a let down. Theirs is an important story--one I don't ever want to forget--about how afraid they are that no one will remember them. But John Green, with his talent and imagination, could have done better by them.  They deserved it.
0545425115|4.0|Yes I usually give in to the hoopla and read what's got the most hype.  When I read this though I couldn't help but compare to Twilight series. Mostly because people keep saying with the movies coming out it going to be the new phenom.<br /><br />So I feel compared to Twilight the writing is much better and just feels powerful.  The detailed description of the characters, the district and the capitol was stunning.  It is a world that was created almost like Harry Potter series.  Like Twilight this has a love story thrown in , very creatively I must say, but disengaged with the love story.  In fact I found my self skimming when it became mushy.<br /><br />I thought the writing to be excellent but did not feel the hype.  The first book really felt like a intro to the characters.  Which makes me wonder how the two other books in the series fare.<br />Saying all that I had fun reading it because it brought me back to enjoy reading as I was on a break.
B006ZCWTV0|2.0|I love Bruce, but \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is not one of his better albums. Aside from the title track and the uplifting \\"We Take Care of Our Own,\\" the rest of the songs are relatively subdued and kind of depressing, to be honest. In fairness, this album is obviously a commentary on the recession that Americans are currently dealing with, so I didn't expect anything too wild and crazy. However, compare this CD to \\"The Rising,\\" which was a rallying call in response to September 11, 2001. Bruce & Company still managed to successfully rock out on that album, which they failed to do here. There's nothing awful about the majority of songs on \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" but there's nothing special about them, either. They struck me as a bunch of mellow filler songs and left me feeling quite unfulfilled. Bruce, I expected more from you. :(
B0021L8V1G|4.0|When I saw this in theaters I felt it was a bit rushed, with too many characters crammed in.  Seeing it at home it feels a little better but some of the twists and turns are still too abruct.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr's performance remains dead on but Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell come close to stealing the show.<br /><br />But the inclusion of Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow starts to slow this down with too many Easter Eggs and superfulous characters.  And the gimick of Tony Stark discovering a new element in his basement jumped out as bad science even by comic standards.  If they'd just called it a new alloy it would have been fine.  Oh well...<br /><br />The second disk has some nice extras, the deleted opening is particularly good, I'm surprised they didn't use it.  And the feature on the use of Flushing Meadow Park and the 1964 World's Fairgrounds warmed my New Yorker's heart.  I'm glad I went with it over the bare bones version.<br /><br />Despite my problems with the plot in the end you get very well realized villains, a flawed but still noble hero and of course lots of cool action.

0307959856|5.0|All I can say is that as I was reading this, I was rejoicing that Jane Austen had actually lived to write another novel. I'd been waiting soooo long for her next book. Now it's here. Yeah, yeah, I know, Jane would have never written a murder mystery - but P.D. James has so perfectly channeled Austen's style and worldview that I really did feel as if I were reading Jane Austen's latest book. What a joy. Can't recommend it highly enough.

HBO video has done a masterful job and the Blu Ray is simply amazing.  Crisp, clear picture, dynamic sound, just everything you would ever want of a Blu Ray Disc. One of (if not) the best looking Blu Ray's I've ever seen. If you're a fan of this show and have a Blu Ray player and HD TV then you must get this set, you will not be disappointed.  The special features are also outstanding.  5 Stars all the way!

B001LF347E|5.0|I was hesitant about Merlin at first, so i began watching in a moment of sheer boredom;however, after the first episode, i was completely into it. The acting was awesome. They give just enough without overdoing it and it being fake. Every episode leaves you mentally begging for the next episode. There is so much suspense, hilarity, romance, and  chivalry. Finally, a show about young people that is not filled with bad language and sexual innuendos in every other line. I hate when i miss an episode and i can't wait for season 4 to be released so i can watch the two that i have missed.
1451648537|5.0|Our library non-fiction book discussion group selected this group and it provoked fascinating discussion. If you want insight into an individual who was the Edison for our age, this book provides an insightful perspective.  Wish all iconic individuals allowed a biographer free scope to interview colleagues, friends and family as Jobs did.<br /><br />One of the questions it raises: what's next for Apple?  As Jobs himself noted, Tim Cook isn't a product person.  Will that make a difference? Another issue to examine is the future better for closed systems and integrated products like Apple offers?  Or more integrated, mixed products such as android devices?  Or is the tech universe big enough for both models to be successful.  Only the future will answer that question.<br /><br />This book has the tone of a Shakespearean tragedy with a lot of humor thrown in.  Jobs is a protagonist who is insanely gifted and fatally flawed at the same time. Rather like Jobs's binary viewpoint of the world.<br /><br />It is fascinating to observe the strands of influence in Jobs' life: design, Eastern influences, meditation, organic foods and farming, Dylan and 60's music, Silicon Valley childhood, the drug culture, Reed College, creative collaboration at Pixar etc. How these intersected in the personality and life of Steve Jobs is an intriguing study.<br /><br />Tracing the development of the tech world through the lens of Jobs's life is also instructive.<br /><br />A fun aspect of this book was observing how some of the luminaries of our age interacted with Jobs's unique personal style.  Bill Gates, Michael Eisner, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Rupert Murdoch, Bono and others interface with Jobs in this book. The result is usually entertaining.<br /><br />This is a brilliant book, structured similarly to one of Jobs's presentations. Loved the book ending with Jobs's own words.<br /><br />I couldn't help but feel that Jobs's destiny was fated.  This book is a bracing look at Jobs as an inspiring visionary and creator, yet a fundamentally flawed human being. Fabulous selection for a book group discussion.nspiring visionary and creator, yet a fundamentally flawed human being. Fabulous selection for a book group discussion.

0743537009|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because Mr. King tortures you along with his characters. Stephen King and Campbell Scott scared the shortcake outta me! I'm a grown azzed man and I haven't been this unsettled after experiencing a book since REVELATIONS. The Nickleson/Kubrick movie is now a joke to me (though that scene with the guy in the dog-suit will forever be the scariest movie moments of all time for me. I was 5 but..damn) It's so corny compared to the sheer evil and terror that really took place at that hotel. Yeah, Mr. King may be long-winded at times in this book, and maybe he was just free-styling like your favorite rapper may have done at other times but Campbell Scott was on point with his dialogue and inflections. (Dick Halloran was superbly characterized by King and  masterfully realized by Scott ). And I'll tell you something else. Even if I have to shout it from the top of the highest mountain or whisper it subliminally into your ear as you sleep: Fawk the movie...Read the book! Because every word of it counts and it all amounts to what the story was meant to be. Not what some idea thieving director thought it should have been!

0061537969|1.0|In an effort to convince an intelligent young friend that reading for pleasure is an educational, habit-forming pursuit, I purchased the paperback version of Racing in the Rain. To my dismay, when I received it, it was a dumbed-down version for young people with a lot of pictures and words like \\"cool\\".  This was not mentioned in the description, and I certainly didn't want to present it to my friend.  As a result, I have had to order the hardback (adult) version also, which makes my total outlay for the book more than twice what I had planned to pay.

0756405890|5.0|A one word description of Patrick Rothfuss' first book in the Kingkiller Chronicles. What is Spectacular!?! That's right Trebek, this book is amazing. Do you like complex characters that react to crazy/awful/evil things like \\"real\\" people would? Do you like world-building that is immense and immersive? Do you like magic systems that are codified, such that you can understand the how and why behind what the characters are doing? Then buy this book NOW!

The writing it terrible, the typos are abundant (I cringed every time I saw your instead of you're), the guy is a criminal who suffers no consequences for his actions, and the girl is quite dull.

B005Z271Y6|5.0|This is one of those occasions when you buy something that you hope will be as good as the reviews indicate and you receive something that is even better than you thought.  It's a concert that is simply breathtaking. One of the other reviewers thought that Adele's voice wasn't the best; there is a whole Albert Hall that would question that!  It is a blissful performance by someone who deservedly has earned the title 'Star'.  She stands on the stage sharing her thoughts and feelings with us in a frank and occasionally blunt manner, which is admirable in its openness and then she performs in such a way that we forget that this is a live, unadulterated performance.  We end up  wishing we were there but we are even more grateful that this allows us to share the event.  It is one of those 'memorable' events.  As for the encore...................................!!!!!

B00065GX64|5.0|M is a brilliant thriller by Fritz Lang. Its is about a child murderer with a chilling whistle. As the police grow tired, criminals step in as vigilantes.<br />Peter Lorre played the child murderer, Hans Beckert. This was his best role ever.<br />This film is very unique because all of the silent parts of the film to dramatize and the use of angles.<br />Thriller and horror movies today is all about blood nd guts and they lay everything out there. A reason why M is a brilliant movie is that they don't show you the dead bodies. You know he kills little girls, but they don't show how he does or how the police find them. This brings a sense of mystery.<br />I recommend this film to anyone. I have to study this film for my film studies class.<br />This movie is still relevant today and it still holds up.<br />Scary movie that is every mother's worst nightmare!<br />:)
B0073LWEXK|3.0|This is a decent game . However it is hard to get from screen to screen. I think it should be a bit cheaper for the hassle of having to constantly refer to the hint screen to see the map. I would have given it four stars had it been cheaper.

B0069JBKHI|3.0|I really wanted to like this.  iPhone/iPad integration, portable, it has some nice features.  I am comparing this against my Sharx SCNC2700W camera. Both are about $300.  Sharx info can be found here:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005WFZD0U Sharx Security VIPcella-IR SCNC2700W Wifi Wireless b/g/n IP network camera with MicroSD DVR and True Day/Night vision]]<br /><br />I did not care for any of the push notifications, other parents may like this feature.  I don't care to hear any audio since I live in a small condo.  The talk back feature is nice, although with a slight delay (to be expected).<br /><br />What I like:<br />* Music feature is nice, but could use some more songs<br />* I like the iPhone/iPad app<br />* Pinch and zoom feature is okay, but I can do the same thing with Sharx camera, although they work a little differently.  The quality increases slightly on the Withings camera where the Sharx camera has no quality gain, but also doesn't need to refresh.<br />* Frame rate seems to stay fairly smooth when connected through ethernet. It's slightly better than Sharx when viewing on iPad.<br />* Portability - This is a nice bonus (1 hour of video on battery) but I don't cover this in my review because I would only use this 1% of the time.<br />* Wireless quality and frame rate don't degrade too much compared to Ethernet (with a good signal).<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />* My main gripe is that I can't view the video on my computer.  I believe Withings has said this feature is coming in the future.<br />* Video quality - not on par with the Sharx camera I own in quality.<br />* Night Vision quality not as good as Sharx.  I would say the Sharx camera night vision is A LOT better actually. The Withings IR lights are too bright in the middle.<br />* No option to force IR mode on/off.<br />* No option to turn off audio on iPhone.  This could be fixed with a firmware update, but not sure if it will ever happen.<br />* Delay - I noticed maybe a 1.5 second delay when connected through ethernet.  A little under 2 seconds wireless.  Sharx delay is almost no delay when viewing on a computer, and less than a half second on iPad. These numbers are with a fairly strong wireless N connection.<br />* Sharx is a half second faster on WiFi than Withings is connected through Ethernet when viewing both on the iPad. I don't mind a small delay, and even 1 second to me isn't that bad.<br /><br />For a baby video monitor, I don't think you need HD quality (Sharx is only 640x480).  You mainly just need to see the baby and be able to tell if they are moving, awake, pacifier out, etc.  The Withings monitor is definitely good enough to be able to see all of this.  The Sharx camera is noticeably better which is a nice bonus. The Withings camera has a wider angle of view than Sharx.  Sharx certainly has a lot more options - continuous recording, snapshots, dydns setup, etc.  Sharx does involve more network knowledge to setup, where the Withings is easier to setup out of the box.<br /><br />If you are not experienced in network setup, DHCP reservation, dyndns configuration, don't mind slightly lower quality, and don't need to view it on a computer (yet), and don't mind a slight lag, the Withings monitor is decent.  If you are a more advanced user, want better quality, instantaneous feedback, and more advanced options, Sharx would be the way to go.  If Withings optical quality was a little better, and I could view it on a computer, it might be a different story, but I think I am going to keep the Sharx unit.  The portability, and iPhone/iPad integration is pretty cool and nerdy, but Sharx still looks better using Safari browser in iPad than Withings does with their app.  I really hope Withings does well with this, because I think they could make a lot better 2.0 product, and a little more work.  That said, it isn't a bad initial offering in my opinion.<br /><br />The biggest deal breaker is Withings charges to view away from home. I think 15 minutes each day are provided free.  My wife loves the setup of the Sharx so she can see her baby when she has time at work.  I would like it if Withings allowed a dns setup so I could use my own bandwidth for away-from-home use.<br /><br />6-1-2012 *I guess Withings has allowed unlimited viewing away from home which is nice, but it should have been offered in the first place.  I still stand by my 3 star review*<br /><br />There are many many other video cameras, IP cameras, & Baby monitors on the market.  These are just the two that I have used.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I have followed Springsteen since his Asbury Park days, heard him in the Roadhouses in Jersey, haven't always liked the music especially the songs that left you in a deep func depression, but he nailed this one. I could feel the Jersey roots, the Irish heritage, but most of all the HEART. Bruce, you hit this one out of the park. Well done. Keep hammering away, we're listening.

The only thing that irritates me, is the poping noise I get when I am doing something on my laptop. Is there something I can do about that? Please let me know. Over all, very nice headset. I would recmond getting rechargable batteries.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|In Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, Coldplay abandons their former stripped-down, vulnerable sound for a grand, varied, orchestra-driven romp of soaring choruses and driving rhythms. Coldplay does a lot of experimentation on this album while keeping it consistent: Exotic-sounding instruments and / or ambient sound effects are employed in almost every tune; orchestral instruments are heard most prominently in \\"Viva la Vida\\" and \\"Yes\\"; and Chris Martin utilizes his full vocal range, from the deep notes of \\"Yes\\" to the higher ones in \\"Lost!\\" and \\"Strawberry Swing\\".<br /><br />\\"Life in Technicolor\\" is an exotic-sounding instrumental (led by what I believe is a yangquin) that provides a powerful, upbeat introduction to Coldplay's new style.<br /><br />\\"Cemetaries of London\\" features very spiritual-sounding lyrics coupled with a surprisingly prominent rhythm section. This is where Coldplay's musical experimentation leaps out at you; this song is probably the second-most aggressive on the album and one of its high points.<br /><br />\\"Lost!\\" is one of the \\"poppier\\" songs on Viva la Vida. It's not the best tune on the album, but it isn't at all bad.<br /><br />\\"42\\" features very minimalist yet spiritual lyrics (\\"Those who are dead are not dead / They're just living in my head\\" and \\"Time is so short, and I'm sure / There must be something more\\" in the first section, and \\"You thought you might be a ghost / You thought you might be a ghost / You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close / You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close\\" in the second section). The song isn't very memorable to me, but it features a nice melody.<br /><br />\\"Lovers in Japan\\" is an upbeat, encouraging tune (\\"Soldiers, you've got to soldier on / Sometimes even the right is wrong\\"). It's paired with \\"Reign of Love\\", the simplest song on the album, just some ambient noises, a piano, and Chris Martin's voice. I think \\"Reign of Love\\" is one of the highlights on the album, if only because itprovides a reprieve from the very grand sound that all of the other songs on Viva la Vida attempt to reach.<br /><br />\\"Yes\\" is where Coldplay throws you a curveball. A somber violin tune turns into a guitar- and rhythm-driven tune complete with sliding violin notes and lyrics about a man yearning for love that he can't get. It's a change for Coldplay, and the song's intriguing sound may turn away some listeners, but I personally believe this song is another highlight. My only criticism is that the song is paired with \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\", the lowest point on the album, where electric guitars, drums, and very, very quiet and indistinct lyrics make for a decent listen but nothing more.<br /><br />\\"Viva la Vida\\" is an obvious high point of the album. Accompanied by an orchestra tune, Chris Martin sings about how a king's rule is undermined (at least, I think that's what the song is about). I love the song if only because it sounds like a movie soundtrack theme with lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Violet Hill\\" is a somber, driving tune about the pitfalls of war. It's probably the most aggressive song on the record.<br /><br />\\"Strawberry Swing\\" features an odd guitar tune that somehow sounds great. Staccato bass strings in the background provide welcome accompaniment, and the ending melody is great. This is a catchy tune that I believe is yet another high point of the album.<br /><br />\\"Death and All His Friends\\" opens with a simply beautiful piano tune that leads into a soaring conclusion -- the last high point of the album in my opinion. Merged with \\"Death and All His Friends\\" is the tune \\"The Escapist\\", which features a very ambient, soothing, synthesized tune that eventually fades back into silence.<br /><br />Some early Coldplay fans may not like Coldplay's turning to a grander sound; I, too, see the benefits of Coldplay's early, stripped-down, earnest approach. But I also believe that Viva la Vida ups the ante whilst keeping what makes Coldplay, Coldplay. If you like exoticinstruments and orchestral elements intertwined with rock and alternative rock tunes, this album is a must-buy; if, on the other hand, you prefer quiet, gentle tunes to grand ones, you may want to purchase one of Coldplay's first three albums -- Parachutes, A Rush of Blood to the Head, and X&Y -- instead.
B003ES5ZPK|5.0|We have six flat screen tvs with flush wall mounts in our new education building.  The cables stuck out so far that the TV couldn't tilt down.

B005EWDA3I|5.0|Why should you read 1Q84?<br />To start with it's one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. It's well crafted, the narrative is built in a solid elegant way, the characters are deep and believable just as the whole story. Actually that's what makes this book so good: it describes a fantasy world where there are two moons in the sky, where little people come out of dead people or goats and start building \\"air chrysalises\\", where a woman can get pregnant without any kind of sexual contact (yes, I know the Bible did it first)... and all that seems incredibly believable. During the time I spent \\"in the book\\" I never doubted there were indeed two moons in the sky.<br />Another reason that made this book so pleasant to me is the way it is written. Beautiful sentences or feelings or just descriptions flow so naturally that I started wondering why I am not a writer or why didn't I come up with this idea first. For example, when Tengo is observing the clouds being pushed by the wind up in the sky, the description goes like this: \\"There was an inexhaustible source of clouds in some land far to the north. Decisive people, minds fixed on the task, clothed in thick, gray uniforms, working silently from morning to night to make clouds, like bees make honey, spiders make webs, and war makes widows.\\" It looks so simple and yet it's so masterly crafted.<br />The way Aomame sees religion and reflects upon it makes it all so simple and complex at the same time: \\"But this isn't their God, she decided. It's my God. This is a God I have found through sacrificing my own life, through my flesh being cut, my skin ripped off, my blood sucked away, my nails torn, all my time and hopes and memories being stolen from me. This is not a God with a form. No white clothes, no long beard. This God has no doctrine, no scripture, no precepts. No reward, no punishment. This God doesn't give, and doesn't take away. There is no heaven up in the sky, no hell down below. When it's hot, and when it's cold, God is simply there.\\"<br />It's when I read passages like the ones quoted above that I start saying to myself: yes, that's it! That's exactly like I see it except that I don't have the talent to put it in words.<br />It's been such a long time since I had the chance to \\"enter\\" a book, to live in it, that it would be selfish of me not to share this feeling with you, hoping you dare to plunge into the pages of this book and experience life in 1Q84.cold, God is simply there.\\"<br />It's when I read passages like the ones quoted above that I start saying to myself: yes, that's it!

B005B0QYMM|1.0|This film really mocks the Ghost Adventure show from the Travel channel. Basically this film is Ghost Adventures with \\"Youtube greenscreen special affects\\". I believe the show wanted to be scary but it really comes off as being obnoxious. It takes bits of elements or key parts from the Ghost Adventure random episodes that you'll recognize as they manifest throughout this film. The main character of the show Lance Preston(Sean Rogerson)gave me the feeling like he didn't want to be in the film by his acting alone. The acting overall is bad, the scares are typical in these found lost tapes genre, shaky cameras, over frustrating acting and bad writing. A combination of what makes a terrible reality film that is not reality but only that its really aweful.<br /><br />By the end finale, I felt the movie creaters, were giving Ghost Adventures a big F.U. and sending a message to them saying that if you are going to be fake, go all the way by adding artificial ghost or scares like they did. This movie was lame and a waste of time.<br /><br />P.S. At least the Ghost Adventures is entertaining to watch fake or real, the entertainment is real, unlike this piece of garbage.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|I grew up watching both the movies and their variety show over and over again. I could never get enough of their zany antics. So I was ecstatic when this movie came to theaters! Watched it the day it came out. I was not dissapointed in the least. I laughed, I cried, I sang along (where I could), I danced in my seat. And upon the all too soon ending I immediately looked up when the DVD was to be released and have been anxiously been counting down the days. I cant wait to watch it again and gain and again!!!!!!
0451529065|5.0|Written more than 1.5 centuries ago, this book was the presentation of the greatest discovery/idea of the history of human-being and the turning point for our modern understanding of the world. Darwin's magnificent theories about the evolution of life on the Earth have since been confirmed by all branches of science. Even if you read this book as a science fiction, you will learn a great deal about how scientific method replaces ancient beliefs with scientific explanations.

0385535139|4.0|This is my first John Grisham novel.  I was very hesistant to start reading his works thinking it'll be too technical for me.  But The Litigators proved to be a fun, entertaining and easy read.  The characters were humorously portrayed.  This made me purchase 2 more John Grisham books =).

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I wont waste time going into the story.  You can see plenty of that in the other reviews.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is excellent and takes advantage of the format more than any disc I currently own.  The picture is flawless with bright colors and a life-like image.  You will notice details you didn't during the original broadcast airing.  For example, the scenes in the crypt were sort of dark and hard to make out during the original airing have been lightened up a bit.  You can see more details of the statues of the Stark ancestry.<br /><br />The DTS audio track is amazing!  Your side channels will get quite a workout.  The sound is immersive, but not overbearing.  I could crank the volume up fairly loud and it still would sound perfect.  I have a 7.1 surround sound system, and there was one scene early in the first episode where a raven comes flying in from the rear to the front that startled my cat and I.  I simply wasn't expecting that sort of detail in sound.<br /><br />There are quite a few extras.  The one that really stands out is the in-episode guide to the Seven Kingdoms.  When you turn this feature on, a side menu with four icons appears over the picture.  Don't worry, you can make it transparent so it's not blocking the scenes.  The first icon brings up a list of characters that are currently in the scene and will give you a bit of information about them when you select them from the list.  The second icon gives you the current location, also with a bit of information.  The 4th icon takes you to the complete guide where you can access all of it's content from a single menu.<br /><br />Then you have the third icon, the History icon, and this is the most interesting.  Periodically, when a character mentions something from past history, it will flash.  When you select that icon, you will see a list of history items, and the one that was just \\"unlocked\\" will be selected.  Press this, and you're taken to a short animated video segment explaining the historic moment the character just mentioned, narrated by one of the characters in the story.  Sometimes its the same historic moment from another viewpoint; so not only does it give you history, it gives you historical perspective from the different houses.  After the history video, it brings you right back to the episode where it continues.  Most of this history is in the narrative of the books, and so I think this was a very clever (and well produced) way to get that narrative back into the hands of the viewers.  It makes this world even richer than it was when we first viewed the series.<br /><br />I also feel that watching episodes back to back makes the series much enjoyable and easier to understand.  This show is dense with characters, history and plot.  So having to wait a week meant having all these details fade before the next episode.  I feel like I appreciate this series even more now that I own it.<br /><br />Finally, I actually received my set on Monday, one day before release the street date, when they had guaranteed release day delivery.  I guess that's one of the perks of being a Prime member.  Kudos to Amazon for their great service.  :)<br /><br />Great series.  Outstanding reference-quality Blu-Ray.  Definitely not to be passed up if you like the series and own a Blu-Ray disc player.

0385528752|4.0|An intriguing book, subtitled How to change when change is hard. As is the case with much of their writing, the brothers Heath challenge traditional wisdom, introducing the metaphor of the Rider (the analytical side of our brain), the Elephant (the emotional, instinctive side) and the Path (the way to get to lasting change). They start this interesting treatise by describing the Three Surprising Things About Change: 1)  Our brain isn't of one mind, 2) What looks like laziness could be exhaustion and 3) What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity.<br /><br />Full of unique and practical examples for working with the Rider-Elephant-Path metaphor (including a heroin-addicted soldier coming back from Vietnam and a company wasting thousands of dollars on rubber gloves!), the book steps through the key steps necessary to invoke change from all three perspectives. They even take the time at the end of the book to provide a one page summary of their recommendations:<br /><br />Direct the Rider-<br />Follow the Bright Spots<br />Script the Critical Moves<br />Point to the Destination<br /><br />Motivate the Elephant -<br />Find the Feeling<br />Shrink the Change<br />Grow Your People<br /><br />Shape the Path-<br />Tweak the Environment<br />Build Habits<br />Rally the Herd<br /><br />Ever the practical writers, they close the book by listing a dozen common problems encountered in the face of change with specific actions to be taken for the Rider, Elephant or Path to get results.

Will he find it?<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by my thirteen year old daughter, who read it in class. I loved this book. I can't wait to read the next book, Gathering Blue, because The Giver leaves you with a cliff hanger! For anyone who likes YA Dystopian novels, this is a must read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some books just end too soon. The characters in Wool are vivid, the world they inhabit is finely drawn, and the story telling is excellent. I especially enjoyed the Omnibus Edition, as I like to read all of the books in a series without losing continuity. Highly recommended.

This album is phenomenal, the songs are so good! You can't go wrong!
0062082353|5.0|I don't usually read autobiographies, and I have never read a book about the war in Iraq before. Why this caught my eye, I don't know, but I was completely engrossed by the story the entire time I was reading it.<br /><br />It isn't perfectly written. The author isn't always admirable. Yet he is incredibly honest about his journey. He is every bit the \\"flawed hero\\" that any great story should strive to include, and the end of his arc is full of sadness, love, and redemption. He also includes a cast of side characters who stole my heart: Ryan, Marc, Taya, his children. Keep a box of kleenex handy.<br /><br />I am changed by reading this book. It has challenged many of my thoughts on this conflict, and, for as black-and-white as the author at one time claims to be, the issues he presents and grapples with span a spectrum of grays. Don't let his \\"good ol' boy\\" style fool you - his story is intelligent and deeply human.
0062082353|3.0|Let me start by saying that I have tremendous respect for all those in our military, including Chris Kyle and his colleagues.  So although my review for the book may not be great, that does not in any way reflect on my opinion on these guys -- my opinion of these guys and what they do for us if FIVE STARS all the way.<br /><br />That being said, compared to other military books I've read, this book is good but not great.  Two in particular that are similar but imho much better than this book are Seal Team Six and Marine Sniper: 93 Confirmed Kills -- I couldn't put those two down.  In contrast while I liked Kyle's book, it was engrossing by any means.<br /><br />Still, if you're a fan of the military genre I would recommend it -- it is entertaining and you will learn more fascinating things about our military and particularly the Seals.

It also doesn't suffer formatting errors like QuickOffice and works offline unlike Google Docs. Best of all, however, it offers cloud support to more services (Box, Dropbox, andGoogle Docs) than the above mentioned apps.<br /><br />All I would ask if for a better icon but that's just the designer in me.

B0071MV540|4.0|I laughed a lot watching this movie.  I'm a writer and I usually can tell what the ending will be but they fooled me.  Eddie Murphy's character was award winning.  His calm manner is sure sign of maturity...or is it?  Matthew Bordericks' character is delightfully manic - your not quite sure when or if he is going to lose it.  The other characters are just as wacky/quirky.  Enjoy.
B003L77GVK|5.0|Previous SG fans, I only somewhat sympathize for you, and I also dont agree with other SGU fans here; SGU's producers should've known they were sticking their necks out by \\"Asking for support from previous SG fans\\".  That backfired; the producers should have anticipated the likelihood that fans from other shows would only want more of the same.  With that said, the original movie was more like SGU than SG1 or SGA.  SGU was awesome.  But, I blame all the weak links for it's cancellation; including shoving in clearly liberal  propeganda... that killed off necessary ratings potential.  Thats not an opinion on the liberal stuff it preached; it's just logic.  But I also blame the idiot bean-counting clock-punchers at the studio for not doing more practical research.. they could have gotten better info from a paid focus group.  All I can say is that ending this show makes me angry to think about, and as a fan I say that I'm truly sorry to the cast and crew... there are many other wonderful shows that were cancelled... you are in great company.
1451683405|5.0|This book succinctly convinced me that free will was an illusion, and it offered some food for thought about the moral implications of such a view. I read it in an evening. What a refreshing change from padded and wandering pop-non-fiction. It's so short and engaging... why NOT read it?
0062068423|5.0|I was a little skeptical of this novel at first; I'd read Headhunters and I wondered if I wanted to put myself through another one of Nesbo's mentally draining, but extremely gripping and entertaining, stories. I'm so glad I did. It's not always easy to find books that are well written and engrossing. This was definitely one of them. It pulls you in, even though at first it's not clear where the plot is going and the narrative spends a lot of time in WWII on the Eastern Front. Still, I found myself trusting Nesbo as a storyteller. I felt like he had a plan. When writing is done well it doesn't call attention to itself; you don't find yourself thinking things like: that was a weird way to say that, or what is he trying to tell me here? When I think back over this story I just remember how the plot moved, and a sense of all the characters.<br /><br />There is little development of the main character, Harry Hole (where/how did Nesbo come up with that name) until almost the second half of the book, but there's enough. And by the time the story concludes I did feel like I had a sense of him. The same goes for the rest of the cast of characters. I loved the relationship Nesbo created between Harry and Ellen.<br /><br />I think the comparison between these books and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is fair; there's lots of coffee being drunk, streets with names like Bjliortesovgono, a likable but troubled anit-hero, and some very, very bad people. But for some reason I got a little different vibe reading this story. I think I might have even liked it better. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good story they can really get into. I've already started the next book in this series.
0061726834|4.0|This book was probably one of the best I've ever read! The way Lauren Oliver gives you the setting is wonderful, using not only words but also your sense of imagination, to create your own idea of what the city looks like. Even if it is just present-day New York, the way she has changed it, makes you wonder what really happen to make such a beautiful city turn into an almost different world. (SPOILER ALERT) Lauren Olver makes such a sincere conflict, someone falling in love in a world where love is considered a deadly disease. And then, once the main character finds out that a secret rebellion has been building beneath her beloved city, the fun really beings. Oliver made a love story, but put in twists and turns like the betrayal of a friend and secret underground parties with music blasting throughout the house. Of course there is always the promise of a  sequal that makes everything better.  (SPOILER ALERT, again) The ending gives you so much to wonder. DId he die? Will she really run away, and leave him to the authorities? And I personally cannot WAIT to read the next one.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Would have liked to have given 3.5 stars but will go ahead and err on the positive side. While holding on to some of the innocence many young adult books exemplify these books also have the grit to keep most readers interested. Original concept, not so subtle social commentary and a healthy dose of pg-13 violence wrapped in a sweetly complicated tale of love, loss and revolution.
1451627289|5.0|I don't like horror or scary stuff so never read Stephen King before, but the premise of this book offered such promise I decided to give him a try.  I was blown away!  I was 11 when Kennedy was assassinated so remember it well.  King captured that time and that event so well.  I thought the love story added a dimension to the book that made it seem so complete and so gripping.  I loved this book and could not put it down until I finished.  If you've been scared away from Stephen King as I have, give this one a try.  It's well worth it.

068484267X|5.0|I bought this book years ago and didn't pick it up to read until last week.  I couldn't put it down once I started.  If you are a reader like me - you suffer right along with the characters.  I just got the sequel 'Tis from Amazon today because \\"Angela's Ashes\\" was so well written that I was longing for more of Frank and his life.  I loved this book!
1469984202|5.0|I was lucky enough to come along to this series when they were all collected into the Omnibus. Such interesting concepts that sucked you in and make you think about your own self-made \\"silos\\". The style is sophisticated enough for an adult, yet not so overwhelming as to scare away a well-read teenager. Keep it up Hugh. You have a gift!
0307891372|5.0|This is a great guide that covers everything in the game.  Strategy guides for the games in the Elder Scrolls series have always been very good and this is no exception.  This is a great companion piece to the game and if you are just a fan of guides or of reading them, then this guide is very much worth it; even if you just want it to figure out some of the details of the game's systems or skills but don't want to spoil the story with it.

B004EPZ00C|3.0|I agree that the deleted scenes were way funnier! I had been so looking forward to the sequel but found the movie a little boring. Tried a little too hard, I would say.<br />Gillian Anderson is horrible here! Looked pretentious with a pretentious accent that keeps slipping! And what happened? She looks so dried-up and skinny - lost all her gorgeous curves! Her face looks wasted and ill.<br />Rosamund Pike is lovely but I find her role underdeveloped and she could have been more interesting! Only Agent One, the baddie is somewhat watchable.. And yes. They should have brought back Bough instead!<br />All in all, kind of stilted.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I got this app. when it was free. I've used this for the past two days now and boy do my abs hurt. You can select how long you want the work out and which level and there is randomize level. There is a video that plays as well as a description of the move. I recommend this app. if you want to start working your abs but don't know how to start. I would buy this app. if I didn't have it already.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|well since sopranos ended i havnt found a show that can replace it. the walking dead is close but its not on the sopranos level and i watched every season of lost but the show was so up an down for me, just when its starts getting good, it would get really lame so while it was a good watch it didnt live up to the hype for me. now that being said the game of thrones is exactly what i wanted. it really is sopranos in middle earth but with a much more realistic story than lord of the rings and very complex as well. although i really could have gone for more wolves cuz when they get mad those puppys dont play they just KILL. this is the fantacy show that tv has needed with great acting, very well written story and a huge budget. the world looks as good as lord of the rings and you can really tell the differnce between citys. all in all this is what iv been waiting for and i watched the whole season on my day off, so needless to say i need more. This show may even take the sopranos place as my all time fav show, i need 2 or 3 more seasons to know but until then i just want you to buy it NOW.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|As someone who discovered that there is a sequel to the story of the Phantom of the Opera, I was willing to listen to the music CD with an open mind.  The CD from the London production have done too much in the direction of \\"humanizing\\" the Phantom, to the point of saddling him with mundane problems.  I still love the music, so I anxiously waited for the Love Never Dies Australian production to get to the theaters.<br /><br />All I can say is the movie has eliminate all that is mundane and fluffy and leave us with a fantastic musical thriller that you can watch over and over again, even if you know how their story ends.  The mood is set from the first song with the lonely phantom, to the ending, which is so much better than what I had seen on an unofficial youtube of a London production.  I will be preordering video and anxiously wait for a CD to be release...

I have only used it a few times with my camera's SD card and it is simple to use and fairly fast to download pics from camera to iPad.<br />Is it worth $29? Depends on your needs.

0312641893|4.0|Is this a re-telling of the classic fairytale Cinderella or not? Hmmm... maybe? Going into this book I sort of thought it was. Very roughly, it is. And I like it that way!!<br /><br />Our Cinderella is Cinder and she's a cyborg. I had to look up the definition of the word because I kept having flashbacks to Star Trek's borgs (yep, I'm that old). In case you're curious, cyborg is short for cybernetic organism and it means a being with both biological and artificial body parts.<br /><br />Because Cinder is not fully human, this makes her a second class citizen in this new, dystopian society. Despite being mostly human, she's treated as property, especially by her stepmother and one of her two stepsisters. This is the first obvious parallel to the classic Cinderella fairytale. But there are subtle differences throughout the story. Throughout the book I kept finding myself trying to figure out who was Cinder's fairy godmother, who were the mice, etc. By the end of the book, I think I had them all figured out.<br /><br />Prince Kai is not your typical, generic prince-charming type. I like his complexity because you have to remember he's young (he's 19) but he is thrust into a position of great responsibility. But the way he is introduced into the story is genius. You hear the myth of the Prince first, then you meet the guy himself. His character then unfolds throughout the book until the very end when you have no idea which way his character will go.<br /><br />Dark, gritty, depressing, but full of hope. This isn't a typical happy fairytale. I wish I could say more but if this is the only review you read about this book (I know, highly unlikely), I don't want to spoil the ending for you. I will just say that the wait is too long for the next book!<br /><br />This was one of those books I kept seeing all over the blogs and hearing great things about it. Honestly, if I saw it in the store on the shelf, I wouldn't have been moved to buy it. In the end, I am so grateful to all my blogging friends that hyped up this book from the very beginning! This was an extremely worthy read - worthy of purchasing the hardcover!!!<br /><br />If you just want to try out Marissa Meyer's style of writing, you could always read Glitches (Lunar Chronicles #0.5). It is a very short prequel to Cinder and you can find it on Tor.com (free!)ll my blogging friends that hyped up this book from the very beginning!

B00406UK7S|4.0|AD 117. The Roman Empire is attempting to complete the conquest of Britain, but is facing fierce resistance from the northern tribes, the Picts. During a Pictish raid on a Roman border garrison, Centurion Quintus Dias is taken prisoner. Determined to end the Pictish threat, Roman governor Agricola dispatches the Ninth Legion under the charismatic General Titus Flavius Virilus to resolve the situation. The Ninth Legion, aided by a treacherous Pictish scout and the escaped Dias, is ambushed and Dias and a small number of survivors must escape back to the Roman lines.<br /><br />Centurion is the fourth movie from British director Neil Marshall, following on from the well-received Dog Soldiers and The Descent (and the not-so-well-received Doomsday), and can be seen as part of a mini-trend of low-budget Roman and medieval films (also including Black Death, Ironclad and The Eagle) made in the last few years.<br /><br />The film has an impressive cast, with the current-hot-property Michael Fassbender starring as Quintus Dias. Fassbender carries the film with aplomb, and makes for a worthy leading man. Dias's restrained, thoughtful but effective style of leadership is contrasted against Dominic West's formidably heroic Virilus, which West handles excellently. After seeing West playing a succession of highly flawed characters, it's a refreshing change to see him playing a stalwart soldier who always does the best thing for his troops. The other actors are also pretty good, most notably Liam Cunningham as the unfortunately-named Ubriculius and David Morrissey as Bothos. Cunnginham, Morrissey and Fassbender have a great on-screen rapport and the scenes where Bothos, 'Brick' and Dias take on the world are great fun.<br /><br />Noel Clarke (Kidulthood and a recurring character on Doctor Who) and Riz Ahmed (whose performance in Four Lions is fantastic) also bring some quality to the smaller roles of Macros and Tarak. Unfortunately, most of the remaining Roman characters lack characterisation to really stand out from the others. The movie also has a rather passive enemy in Gorlacon (Ulrich Thomsen) who fails to convince as a master warlord and tactician. More impressive is Olga Kurylenko as Etain, the mute warrior who leads the hunt for Dias and his men. Etain is mute, so Kurylenko has to get across her character without the aid of dialogue, which is a formidable challenge but one she rises to. The only other female character of note is Arianne (an interesting but ultimately too-brief appearance by Imogen Poots), a 'witch' the Romans encounter in the woods who turns out to be nothing of the sort.<br /><br />The film starts out as a war movie, with its biggest setpiece being a chaotic battle in the woods clearly inspired by Gladiator's opening battle but with only a small amount of the budget available to film it. Marshall spends his resources wisely here to get maximum bang for his buck, resulting in a reasonably good battle sequence that gets across the incoherent chaos of this type of warfare very well. The rest of the move is a thriller in which one group of characters chases another across the Scottish Highlands. These sequences, filmed on location in Scotland, are stunning, showcasing some of the impressive vistas and landscapes in the north of Britain and adding authenticity to the action.<br /><br />Structurally, the film struggles with the fact that it's basically a countdown to a final confrontation between the hunters and the hunted, and Marshall elects to get this out of the way sooner rather than later, contributing to the film's lean run-time of just 93 minutes. Impressively, he adds a subplot about how the Roman soldiers' years of struggle and sacrifice to bring the Picts to heel is sold short by the Emperor Hadrian's decision to withdraw from the lands they have managed to secure so he can build a new defensive wall. This then factors into the film's ending, giving us a different finale to what viewers may have been expectinggiven the film's genre and set-up.<br /><br />On the negative side, the movie could have done with engaging with the morality of the situation a bit more decisively. The Romans are invaders in a country not their own and have conducted crimes of unspeakable brutality against the natives. As a result Etain and her people's military campaign against the Romans can be seen as fully justified. However, the film's structure and point-of-view seem to rely on us siding with the Romans. If Marshall was going for a more complex viewpoint - of sympathising with the Roman soldiers on the sharp end of the campaign whilst disapproving of the overall reasons for the invasion and occupation - this is not really given enough screentime to be effective. A sequence nodding in this direction in which Rachael Stirling plays the cunning and ruthless daughter of a Roman senator falls flat, as she only appears in one scene with no preamble. As a result, the movie's moral throughline feels confused and incoherent.<br /><br />Centurion (***½) sports some excellent performances, some good pacing and some strong scenes of both characterisation and action. It certainly looks like much more money was spent on it than was the case (it certainly looks more epic and impressive than Ironclad, which had twice the budget of Centurion). Unfortunately, the film misses an opportunity to talk about the rights and wrongs of the situation and the potential for a more nuanced movie about war and occupation is lost. What we are left with is certainly an entertaining, well-made action movie but not much more than that. The film is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).

1576875776|1.0|I was super excited that Vivian Maier's work was being released in book form. But upon reading reviews that the original work was changed to tinted in sepia tones I canceled my order.<br /><br />I will wait until a book is published that showcases Maier's work in a form more true to its source. I want cold and true blacks and silvers. I've always hated sepia. I don't know why the creators of the book decided to go with sepia. Looking at her photographs online I don't know why they felt the need to dip their fingers in the pie. Leave well enough alone, I say.<br /><br />I'd pay an extra $20 for a true black and white book. Too bad. Just too bad. I'll wait rather than buy something I couldn't stomach to pick up and look at.

1612930875|4.0|The problem I face with most kinds of classic books is the fact that it is held on such a high pedestal it will never reach the standard that I have imagined it would be, but that isn't the writer's fault. It is the fault of those annoying intellectuals who discuss them in their book groups, and look down on those peasants who haven't been lucky enough to go to university and taught why these books are so great, the (insert your own appropriate description of these people). It is also my own fault, because I'm an opinionated narcissist who scorns any who oppose his views, which is why I hate those people who belittle simple book for being simple and not an intwined conundrum of revealing insights to the writer him/herself, sometimes we just like simple!<br /><br />I picked Treasure Island up after watching the recent version on TV, starring Executive Transvestite Eddie Izzard (well done if you know that joke), and I wondered how far off this adaption was to the book. Previously I had watched adaptations of many books to film, and decided to see if this show had gone the way of The 13th Warrior (watch this film, it is absolutely amazing) or the dark rage filled minutes of the modern Clash of the Titans (a terrible film, watch the older version just for nostalgia purposes). The show was placed in a comfortable middle, not good, but didn't completely ignore the book, and just use the title because Hollywood couldn't be bothered with thinking up their own title and names!!<br /><br />Now my quota of classic fiction is very bare. I have always found the writing dull and sometimes difficult to understand, even though the obvious reason being that is was made in a different age, and I should stop being such an uncouth bum hole and appreciate the genius of the work. However I fear that I have set my bar for classic literature very high due to reading Dumas Count of Monte Cristo, a book I have advised everyone I've met to read, and so far proud of the fact I have made threepeople read a masterpiece they never would have if it weren't for me. I know this isn't a review of Monte Cristo, but I can't stress enough how amazing this book is, it passes the hate filled cynic part of my brain, and makes me feel that there still is hope for humanity.<br /><br />Treasure Island should be taken for what it is, a boy's adventure. That is the basic plot line of this book, following the adventure of young Jim Hawkins as he searches for the lost treasure of Captain Flint, but faces the survivors of Flint's old crew, led by the original wooden legged pirate John Silver. This book is a amazing tale of swashbuckling heroism of some true English gentlemen as they embark on a voyage that has danger lurking around every corner. Now there are some very annoying aspects of this book, but I fear that it is because it hasn't escape through the misery of my personal being, but these are few and far between. The book doesn't drag out descriptions or dialog like many novels will, nor does it focus on the inner turmoil of the protagonist. What it does it leap and bound between action and adventure like any boyish adventure should. Areas of the novel that some writers could drag on and on, Louis Stevenson doesn't, he writes an excellent book that could be read on a warm summer's afternoon where you could transport your mind away from whatever dull meaningless existence that you are living, to a world of pirates and adventure that you dreamed of when you were a child.<br /><br />The only problem that I do have with this book is that the pirates are held in an almost good light, just as vagabonds or loveable rogues like Silver is shown, when the sad truth of these men is a far darker tale. Now I know that books couldn't be written like they can now and the book was a harmless adventure, but I can't help but like Silver's character, which is I'm sure the aim of the book, but that is what I find the problem. I wanted to hate Long John Silver like I hated Pew, but you find him a nice guy, which we know wouldn't have been the case. However I can't argue with the fact that this book helped spark the love of pirates that every boy has, and because of this book I hopped around on my garden wall trying to impale my brother with a stick demanding him to walk the plank. It is this amazing adventurous spirit that I love about the book, and the reason that it should hold the title of classic.

Even though I got this for free, I would be willing to pay the $0.99 that this app normally costs because it is so cute and fun.<br />Going Nuts is a game in which you are a flying squirrel that can pick up nuts.  There are a few different types of nuts, regular, poison, golden, fire, and frozen.<br />The game gives you different goals to achieve.  When you achieve those goals, you advance to the next level and get a new goal.  When they designed this game they made sure that you have three different goals at once, so if you get frustrated you can just move on to the next goal for awhile.  You also have to dodge trees, owls, and TNT.  There are also specialty things in the store that cost nuts that you have collected.  You can outfit your squirrel in different costumes, purchase helmets, head starts, and magnets to help you attracted nuts.<br />I have to say that this game is so much fun that my friend who owns a Galaxy Tab went out and purchased this game for herself.  I cannot tell you how many hours I have focused on this game instead of doing other things that I should have probably been doing.
0545091020|1.0|This is a toned down version of Battle Royale.  How cheap does an author have to be to steal an idea from another book or movie!  In any case, I listened to the audio version of the book and really struggled because not only is the book badly written, Carolyn McCormick's reading was awful.  I thought she was just a bad actor in Law and Order but now I know she's no better in reading books aloud for audiences.  Ugh!

B00028HBKC|5.0|Most reviewers miss the purpose Mel Gibson had in making this film. This will explain it from a Christian perspective. The crucifixion of Christ is central to all believing Christians. It is their beginning, their end and their rock. Love or hate them, if you expect to understand them read this without developing opinions until the end.<br /><br />Bear with me as I have to lay some groundwork for you to understand my comment. I don't ask you to believe the Bible, only to understand the purpose of the film.<br /><br />The movie is meant for Christians. It is meant to show what Christ did for them and for everyone (whether they understand or not). The Bible was written over a period of 1400 years by 44 different people. It is complicated because it has a number of different messages or themes, of which I will not attempt to cover.<br /><br />For the purpose of this comment, what is central to the Bible are four basic threads. 1) It is a book of prophesy, mostly prophesy about the coming Christ (there are over 100 of these, all of which were fulfilled by Christ). 2) There is the story of his 3 year evangelism, in which He proved by miracles that He was the Christ (prophesied 100's of years earlier). 3) It describes Christ's sacrifice, death and resurrection (proving that Christ has power over death). 4) It describes what a Christian is to exhibit in their life (How they are to live).<br /><br />You may believe the Bible is a total fake, I am not defending it. But that does not change what I state above. Those four threads exist in the Bible. That is fact. I need to say that in order to explain the reason for the film.<br /><br />The Bible states that God sent Christ, His Son, to be a sacrifice for all. Before Christ, Jews had to sacrifice animals to absolve them of sins but animals were not perfect sacrifices. Christ had to be a PERFECT sacrifice. He was (Proven by Jewish history and their losing their homeland). Also to fulfill the prophesy given 700 years before Hisarrival (see Isaiah chapter 53), that He had to suffer the terrible punishment you see in Gibson's film.<br /><br />Let me pause. Non-Christians will find it implausible, inexcusable and abhorrent that any god would be part of the acts seen in the film or in my statements. To make it even more confusing, God is a loving God. He wants only good for everyone. Talk about something inexplainable!<br /><br />It is a waste of time for me to try and explain or defend this. You can discard the Bible as fiction but it is what is written on its pages. In that, there can be no dispute.<br /><br />The Bible is unique in history. There is no book that is a compilation of different authors where they all agree and present a cohesive message, let alone doing it over a period of more than a thousand years.<br /><br />So what was the purpose behind such a violent, unpleasant film?<br /><br />Christians understand that Christ was a sacrifice for their sin, allowing them to enter the Kingdom of God. But before seeing the film, I did not really comprehend it on a visceral level. If I am an example, the film is a success; \\"It was important that I experience His sacrifice\\". If you feel that you, your church or group will benefit from a better understanding of Christ's sacrifice, get the film. It has no equal in its scope or purpose.<br /><br />That was the purpose of \\"The Passion of Christ.\\" It shows the price that God and Christ really paid so that Christians could enter the kingdom.<br /><br />I can hear someone saying, \\"Whoop Eee Doo.\\" See! That proves my point that most reviewers do not understand the film. Some will feel my comment is crazy, stupid or worse. That does not change the truth presented here. Remember that I only present what the Bible states, not asking you to believe it.<br /><br />If you question me and want to investigate on your own, go to the Internet. There is a free Biblical resource that will help you look into it. In your search engine, type \\"eSword\\" to find the site. I've always believed that the truth is revealed when you understand all sides of an issue.<br /><br />If you want to look into the existence of Christ, investigate the \\"Shroud of Turin\\" on the Internet. It is believed by many that this is the shroud that covered Christ when His body was laid in the tomb. It is a controversial but a fascinating story.<br /><br />If you want to look into whether history and archeology back up the Bible, look up \\"Ron Wyatt\\" on the Internet. He was an amateur student of Biblical history and discovered some interesting facts. As with all things relating to the Bible, everything has its naysayers so you can come to your own conclusions.

B004LROMQG|5.0|I started watching this back during season 1. I bought one episode off of iTunes, got hooked from the beginning and bought the season pass. I am a huge fan of the Arthurian legends because they are nothing like this life, they take you to a place fraught by similar situations but with very different players with very different powers. Merlin continues the tradition, and its feel good episodes do not disappoint. Unlike Starz' Camelot, Merlin is appropriate for the whole family, there are no gratuitous sex scenes, or intensely violent acts. Your kids can watch this but you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it. As an adult I fully endorse this show. I've recommended it to others and they've become hooked as well. Buy one episode off of iTunes if you are a skeptic, it's $2 you won't regret. Highly recommended. No, very highly recommended.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book despite a few dissonances of plot development.  I stayed up late several nights in a row to finish it in a few days.  It is very exciting, and I teared up in spots.  I loved the Mutts, the tracker jackers, and especially the mockingjays.  Rue captured my heart. Maybe the Book Moguls have designated this as a YA entry, but I'd recommend it to all ages. Plus, omg, Capitol can control the weather!<br /><br />Caesar, Flavius, Venia, Octavia, Cinna, Portia - Let me do a wild leap of logic and guess there is an ancient Roman Empire tie-in.  This also indicates: Capitol-Rome; Hunger Games-Gladiator Games; Punic War-Panem War.<br /><br />Since I haven't read the rest of the trilogy yet, my quibbles might be premature. However, the Capitol is not Rome in that the technology is so advanced it is in the magic stage in comparison to the 12 Districts, which purposely have been bled dry of resources and enslaved.  This kind of technology requires scientists, doctors, technicians, biologists, system designers, major engineering and physicists.  Where are they? Where were their voices or characters? Perhaps the servants and the political sycophants are shallow and dimwitted, but that level of technology means huge brainpower and education underpin this society.<br /><br />The regular citizens of Capitol are vapid, bored and looking for ever greater entertainment stimulation, not worried about actual effort or accomplishment of their own making.  The ancient Roman (and American) correlation is clear, but where is the leadership? The ancient Roman leaders were men of great personal stature, not only as educated as it was possible to be, but also men of tremendous military experience and wealth. They were ambitious and ever searching for new worlds to conquer.  Wealth was a secondary concern to advancing their family rank and class. Of course, this changed during the passage of time, and when the aristocrat class lost ambition, they turned to clothes, exotic entertainments, food and furniture, which was the beginning of their end. : )<br /><br />The missing people of the political and technology spheres are the dissonance for me. There are none in this book.  If Capitol is living on the fumes of a previous functioning society, then indeed they are ripe for a revolutionary takeover. If these classes of people don't exist or they are simply more vapid and shallow aristocrats, then who is maintaining the tech? If the technology class exists, why aren't they pushing out to greater theaters of accomplishment, like space? If the political class wants power and wealth, and most do, why aren't they using the technology to invade the other continents, or at minimum doing trading and embassy work? This is why the story unhinges a bit for me and why I am such a fan of Frank Herbert.  The story proceeds from the young gladiators'viewpoint and their contact with Capitol is all about participating in a 'Reality' video entertainment, so maybe there is more to show later in regards to the other layers of Capitol.<br /><br />It is still a good book to read.nments, food and furniture, which was the beginning of their end. : )<br /><br />The missing people of the political and technology spheres are the dissonance for me.

B004H4XDBI|5.0|I enjoyed If I Stay, but Where She Went took things to a whole new level. The characters are more developed and emotions run much deeper. The ending is great too! I don't write a review unless it's a positive one. This book is definitely worth the read!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Oh my gosh, this has to be one of the best shows ever! im reading the second book, and watched the first five episodes, and they are extremely faithful to the book (unlike Eragon, that movie was pure crap). i cant wait to get my copy of this season. a little less nudity would be good, but otherwise, amazing!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great set of games some harder than others<br />but loving the challenge of trying to get to the 101 games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game..you have to earn points as you play all the different types of games to get more games and it is just soooo much fun! You won't get bored with the different amount of games it has :)
B005NGKMOU|4.0|Sam Shepard plays the part of Butch Cassidy to perfection (IMO), the scenery is very beautiful, the action a bit slow which is a benefit, and the remaining cast does a superb job in supporting roles.  All in all, I would not rate this movie in the same league as the original Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, it is good enough in all aspects to rate a 4 star review from me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I found this game weird at first. then it became addictive. once I started playing more I enjoyed the variety. I think that a lot of people like it but I hope it isn't or doesnt include any type of spam.
0062082353|1.0|I am a prolific reader and have an impressive library.  This book made me so upset I threw it out after reading it.  I did finish it, although many, many times I wanted to stop but figured maybe he (the author) would be able to change my opinion of him.  He is a self-serving, egotistical killer.  You would think he was fighting the war all by himself.  All other books I have read of this genre,<br />(Black Hawk Down, Lone Survivor, Seal Team Six, etc.) have impressed me and made me proud to be an American.  This guy just made me sick.

0671027573|5.0|I've read two Linda Howard books and they are intoxicating and addicting!<br /><br />Mr. Perfect is funny and sad, and you actually cringe - cringe! when you realize who the killer is targeting.  I mean you know it's a suspense-murder-mystery-romance, so someone's going to die.  Like in Star Trek, the Ensign that beams down to the planet is going to bite the dust, so is someone near the beginning of a murder mystery book.  But Howard had woven such a nice story of four women who worked together and were close friends, that for once, I wasn't cheering for the story to plunge full speed ahead and get to the action pages.<br /><br />Nope.  I was really hoping someone would step out of the shadows and save the day.<br /><br />This book was FUNNY.  I laughed out loud several times.  The romance scenes between the hero/cop and the heroine/neighbor were hilarious!  She thought he was a 24 karat drunken jerk - that is until she found out he was a cop.  Then an incident happened when he helped the heroine dispose of a belligerent drunk who attacked the young mother a few doors down.<br /><br />Later, heroine sprayed hero with the garden hose, and he.  Well.  He kissed her.  Really kissed her.  Made her crazy.  The entire story changed with this one kiss.  And boy.  What a kiss.  Howard writes rather tame and short - almost brusque romance scenes, but her kissing scene is a red-hot flaming scorcher!  Wow!<br /><br />Favorite line/scene:<br />(This happens days before THE kiss)<br />\\"Don't kiss me,\\" she said warningly, because he seemed somehow closer, though she hadn't seen him move, and his gaze was centered on her face in that intent look men get before they make their move.<br /><br />\\"I don't intend to.\\" he replied smile a little.  \\"I don't have my whip and chair with me.\\"  He stood up and stepped back, his hand on the car door to close it.  He paused, looking down at her.  \\"Besides, I don't  have time right now .  \\"We both have to get to work, and I don't like rush jobs.  I'll need a couple of hours, at least.\\"<br /><br />She knew she should keep her mouth shut.  She knew she should just close the car door and drive away.  Instead she said blankly, \\"A couple of hours?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yeah.\\"  He gave her another of those slow, dangerous smiles.  \\"Three hours would be even better, because I figure that when I do kiss you, we'll both end up naked.\\"<br /><br />Is that cool dialogue or what!?<br /><br />This book is funny and a breeze to read - but be warned: If you buy it, you'll end up reading half the night.  It's worth it.  I'm going out now to hunt down some more Linda Howard books.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS:<br />Heroine moves into first house.  Next door neighbor appears to be obnoxious jerk.  Heroine and 3 friends make up a fun list of the attributes of \\"Mr. Perfect\\".  List accidentally goes public and becomes nation wide news.  Then, one of the 4 is murdered.  Neighbor turns out to be a cop and hero of the story.  Heroine is drawn to him like a gator to a poodle.  (Should I say like fire to gasoline instead?)<br /><br />Someone is stalking the remaining group, and they all struggle with the grief of loss, while the hero and heroine become more than neighbors.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br />The murderer is a woman at the company.  Everyone was looking for a man due to the severity and anger of the murder.  That's why the victim opened the door.  The killer was raised as a boy by her psycho mother, and was just plain crazy.  She was taught to be literally `Mr. Perfect' by psycho mom, whom she/he killed when she was 15.  There is an awesome scene where the heroine and her house-wife sister fight off crazed psycho killer with a hockey stick and their bare hands, and all ends well.<br />I LOVED:<br />The realistic and funny interactions between the siblings.  They would fight, but when her sister got wind that she was hurting due to grief, she came over with cucumber slices and became comforting family, not just her life long rival.<br /><br />Theinstantaneous romance with the cop was the way grownups work.  He didn't wait.  He was in love, so the next obvious move is marriage.  Getting the job done right away is the grownup way to proceed.<br /><br />The funny little signs the geeks put up at their office.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />In reality, a US company would pitch a hissy fit at<br />a) newsletters being circulated at their business which could make a perceived hostile work environment.  That would never happen.<br /><br />b) the US company would seriously reprimand or possibly fire workers from their business who are in the media like this four were. They would not want their name associated with anything to do with this.<br /><br />c) I thought the men in their lives were silly for being threatened by a funny list of what makes Mr. Perfect.  What a bunch of over-reacting babies.  But - suspend reality and just enjoy the storyline.  I know I did.instantaneous romance with the cop was the way grownups work.  He didn't wait.

B0015XHQTE|5.0|The price was the selling point for me. It would have been a lot more expensive to buy each movie on an individual purchase. The box set was also very well put together. Thank you for the fast delivery.
B0060Q962Q|1.0|I don't like it because it keeps wanting to force close and won't even turn on for those of you who gives this good earrings is because it works for you guys.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|great game but too expensive, five dollars is a lot for one game. I have only played the trial version.
0763644765|4.0|Very simple language, fairly easy to understand. My son likes it so there's the test. I really enjoy this author's artwork. Also read \\"Higher, Higher\\" Which is one of my son's favorites. He loves the undies in the back.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|the worst screenplay ever to end up in the black, then what is? Please comment!  The script break every principle (let's not get that one wrong)every ***** screenplay guru whose books are selling on this site recommends.  Absolutely lousy acting, and an unbelievably pretentious storyline to begin with.  And I loved Independence Day. 2012 is JUNK.  The only apocalypse is that of the criteria of the film viewing audience (or perhaps???). Enlighten me, o dogwalkers!!! Don't forget those little plastic do-hingees.  You mavens of cinematic art!

B006OFN0SE|2.0|No wonder this was not a big hit. Who wants to watch a two-hour love story about two quite old and unattractive gay men? That's what the filmmakers chose to make this bio-pic by aiming at the relationship between Hoover and Clyde Tolson, his right-hand man. And while it's essentially accurate, it still does not make for compelling viewing. We like our movie heroes to be people we can root for, but the Hoover on show here is very bipolar. So we never really decide if we like or dislike anything about him. This Clint Eastwood directed vehicle was scripted by a very young man, so maybe that's one of the problems. I also wish they had included some extras of the real Hoover so we could at least make a direct comparison. Leo diCaprio seems to get Hoover's intensity, sexual ambiguity and ambition in droves. They also manage to encapsulate almost 50 years of one man's career into just over two hours. But the scene where Hoover tells RFK, \\"The president is dead,\\" and then simply hangs up, was probably a bit over-dramatized. RFK, in reality, was having lunch outside at Hickory Hill in Virginia when that call came, not in his Justice Department office, as seen here.
B007H7XJD4|3.0|So this is a just a rip off of 300 and Clash of the Titans, but i still enjoyed the movie. The plot was very weak and the acting was only ok.The fact that zeus wouldn't allow the gods to help and then it end the way it did really annoyed me, but the special effects where detailed and way better then 300 and clash of the titans and that saved the movie.
B002JMLMKE|5.0|One of the best books out there, don't take the theme or story line too literally and you will avoid all the drama around it. Just enjoy great writing and suspense, that's it.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Truly this is one of those shows that is easy to overlook UNTIL you actually sit down and watch it! I had heard about this show but it never really interested me. Then last summer I decided to watch it, so I rented it on Netflix. Let me just say WOW! I really didn't expect to love it as much as I did. This is the only show on TV that I find myself actually laughing at. I have had friends and family actually come up to me while watching it to check and see what had me laughing so hard. Jim Parsons, who plays Sheldon, is such a magnificent actor! But really the whole cast is great and the characters go together so well. If there is one show I would recommend to anyone it would be The Big Bang Theory. This is a show that I actually want to watch over and over and HAD to buy the dvds so I could watch it at anytime. Watch it, you won't be disappointed.

The love Christin feels for Ana is the kind you would love to feel for a moment and then be scared at the control at the same time.. This is a must read for anyone wanting a nice escape from reality!!! You will be left speechless of what this book makes you feel and think of!! Enjoy as i have!!!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Forget for a moment that this book is the third in a trilogy.  Forget that you're a fan of the previous books.  Instead, look at it as an entity unto itself.<br /><br />On that level, \\"Mockingjay\\" is the story of a societal upheaval and class war, narrated by a character who is absent from the majority of the action.  A doting character who spends more time anxiously wondering when her two potential lovers will come home from battle (and which of them she'll choose), rather than having a part in the battle herself.  Who spends several moments drugged or unconscious (again, this is the NARRATOR), and has characters explain to her in giant expository blocks of dialogue how the story moved forward without her while she was out.  A character who can't make decisions, and instead allows story contrivances to make choices for her.  These things describe a pretty bad book.<br /><br />NOW think about the fact that the weak character described here is Katniss Everdeen, the proactive, no-nonsense, survivalist hero of \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Catching Fire.\\"<br /><br />It's no longer just a \\"bad book.\\"  It's a travesty.<br /><br />Apologists seem to think that the negative reviews are from readers who couldn't handle how \\"dark\\" this book is, who didn't like that it ends with no \\"happily ever after\\" moment, but this isn't true.  The problem isn't that the story goes places fans don't want it to go.  The problem is that it's a poor story, poorly-told.  It is really that simple.  Beyond what's above, the book introduces numerous bland \\"red-shirt\\" characters you're meant to care for (SPOILER: you don't) only so it can wring some emotion from you when they're summarily killed off.  Even the characters from the previous books act out-of-character to the point that they're nearly unrecognizable.  The narrative action is poorly-written and oftentimes difficult to follow.<br /><br />As for the ending itself, for all the claims of how \\"true to life\\" it's meant to be, it's remarkably contrived, especially in how Collins ONCE AGAIN shoehorns the titular Games into the story.  Everything about it feels false.  Events occur that are cloying and manipulative, and it's shameful.  This book feels like the result of Collins being forced to get this book finished so they could get to work on the films.<br /><br />It's bad enough to make you want to blot it from your memory as not existing in the Hunger Games universe.  A sad whimper of a way to close out such a great series.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I have played this on the iPod Touch and playing it on the Kindle is nicer. Smooth movement and the game has improved a lot.  I look forward to building a new city and watching it grow.
1904994768|4.0|In a nutshell, the 2012 Gamer's Edition is very similar to the 2011 version.  There are trivia quotes at the bottom of each page and the entire book is laid out by game genre.  Just like last year, my only complaint, although minor, is I wish they had more off-the-wall records and records for lesser-known games.  But for around $10, this book is an easy buy and engaging for any interested gamer.
1881273156|4.0|I was recommended this book a while ago while I was deep in depression and thought my relationship was on the outs. I didn't get a chance to read this book then, and I can say that I would have made things quite easier for me. I'm past all that now, but it was still a great book to read and gave me some great insight into myself and my relationship.<br /><br />The five love languages are basically 5 ways that people express and understand love. The way Mr. Chapman describes it (and what really made the concept click for me) is that it's just like speaking language. If you're raised in a home that speaks English you learn English and that is your primary language. You can learn to speak another language, but you'll be most fluent in your primary language. The love languages are the same way.<br /><br />Understanding the different languages is really quite simple. The explanation behind the different languages is very easy to understand. As soon as I'd read about one of the languages I would associate that language to someone I know. Having a \\"real-life\\" example for each language helped me understand that language a little bit better. It was easy for me to pinpoint other people's languages but it's been a bit harder for me to pinpoint my own language.... There is a section in the book that helps you figure out your own, and after reading it I've narrowed mine down to three. But before that sections I was thinking well I am all of those. But really we're only one, sometimes two. So I just need to pay attention a little bit more to what I feel and I should have it figured out fairly soon. And if you're not like me - and can't figure out the language for the people in your life- there is also a section to help you figure out what language other people are.<br /><br />This book specifically deals with the love language of couples, but I think this concept is beneficial for any relationship - siblings, friends, parents, children. And since there is a whole series of these books I don't think I'm too far off in my thinking...<br /><br />What I liked the most about this book is that for each language there was a story that gave an example of that language. Chapman would introduce us to a couple, tell us what their problem(s), and then tell us what their love languages were. He also gives examples for each language of how to show love to another person using that language.<br /><br />This was  very well written book. I wish I would have picked it up earlier, as it could have made a very difficult part of my life a little bit easier. But even though things were going good for me and my boyfriend (who is now my fiancee) when I read this it still gave me some insight into why we do (or don't do) certain things. It also helped me in communicating what I need and want in my relationship. So this book isn't just for relationships that are failing, but if yours is I would recommend reading this. This book (and I'm sure the entire series) can help you better understand the relationships you have with eveyone that you love.books I don't think I'm too far off in my thinking...<br /><br />What I liked the most about this book is that for each language there was a story that gave an example of that language.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|My God. What this little girl went through is the stuff of horror novels. I'm 30 and I can't imagine going through that, let alone at 11 years old. This book shows us how much humans can be put through and still survive. It's one of those situations where you have to be in it to know what you would do. People complain about the simplistic writing style. I say that is the book's strength. You view this monster through the eyes of a little girl. Ironically, it wasn't the actual descriptions of the nightmarish rapes and torture that occurred that haunted me; for me, it was reading the journal about her cat Eclipse. People have said that they skipped through that part. Read it again. Observe how child-like she wrote, along with the pictures of hearts and flowers. Didn't you write that way when you were 12 years old? Now take a step back and reflect about what she was going through. It's a harrowing thought. This girl was being raped, sleep deprived and tortured for at least a year and half, and here was this innocent journal about a cat. And then observe the other instance where she was asked what she wanted, and she replied that she wanted a Disney and Highlights magazine. Unbelievable. The point I'm making is, this was still a very, VERY, young-minded girl who had not even been jaded despite the heinous treatment she suffered from this large, psychopath. The descriptions of the cats are significant, not only because they were the only non-threatening company she had, but the childlike quality by which she describes them makes her circumstances even more appalling.<br /><br />This book made me furious at Phillip Garrido. What a disgusting waste of life. This inhuman monster needs to be bludgeoned to death with blunt objects, along with that wife of his. Is she even a woman? What planet was that broad from? What kind of woman helps her husband rape and torture an 11 year old girl? Unreal. There are some loonies out there.<br /><br />The vivid descriptions of the isolation, loneliness, and \\"runs\\" (when he would pretty much keep her up all night for days and rape her whenever he wanted), are NECESSARY. This monstrosity should never be sugar-coated or made to be \\"reader friendly.\\" This is true life. This is reality. Millions of kids go through this terror every minute, of every hour, of every day. Well done to Ms. Dugard for writing those years in such a realistic style, as if you were standing by and watching it occur in front of you. She is a very talented writer.<br /><br />This story has a \\"happy\\" ending, but she'll never, EVER, EVER, get over what happened to her. Who WOULD? Think about Holocaust survivors. They got on with their lives but the TINIEST thing would set off a flood of terrible memories. The most striking thing about Ms. Dugard (as is seen in her later journals) is her absolute REFUSAL to be hateful. She is extraordinary. If I met her, I'd tell her to take the remaining 50+ years of her life and OWN IT. She has deserved that time more than anyone on the planet.<br /><br />Read this book. On the one hand, it makes you lose faith in humanity knowing there are Phillip and Nancy Garridos out there. But then Jaycee Dugard restores this faith.
B005Q1W0ZQ|1.0|The video for this product is excellent. However the audio encoding is quite flawed. I have an Oppo BDP-93SE Blu-ray player with the latest upgrades. To get the best sound and keep up with audio encoding format enhancements I use the player's processor with upgraded software, high grade DACs and clock to decode the audio and send it directly to the Denon Video Receiver. However, there is some flaw in the audio encoding that results in no center channel output and very little subwoofer output. I also have a Sony player that produces the same output problem. No other blu-ray I possess (over 80 of them) has this problem and they all play perfectly in the Oppo. I can only assume that the PBS conversion of the English version was done sloppily.

B004WKOCP8|1.0|I had hope beyond hope that my favorite band had recovered from the lyrical mess that was \\"Light Grenades\\" but it appears that band I loved is gone. It has been replaced with a soft, mediocre and lazy sounding band. With two exceptions, I don't even know where the rest of the band is in this album. This is Brandon Boyd's solo album repackaged with the Incubus name. I felt physically ill and heartbroken after listening to this album, I think I would rather catch my wife in bed with another man than listen to it again.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm only on my 2nd day of this workout at level 1 and wow this is serious.  I don't see how its possible to NOT get results with this workout.  It goes by super fast, but your gonna want to punch jillian the whole time. shes not playing around.  It doesn't allow breaks but I for damn sure take my water breaks in between sets.  First time I did it was last night and I could barely walk today..thought I would be discouraged to do it again tonight since my legs hurt so bad but if you do the workout again its really not that bad..walking was more painful, and just do the modified versions.  I am 20 yrs old, 170 pounds 5'5...looking to lose about 25 lbs..I'm not in shape at all and I have never did any type of strength training so I really do like using weights along with the cardio and not just cardio alone.  I'm excited to keep doing this workout.  Its no hard movements, the only thing I literally can not do is push ups, but I just do as far as I can, (about 1inch down lol). Defiantly recommend this video to people out of shape like me and even in shape.  I have 3lb hand weights and there are times I cannot lift my arms anymore so if your a beginner I would recommend 2 lb weights! they dont feel like much when your buying them but believe me you will feel them in this dvd! :)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|What can I say about City of Ashes (Mortal Instruments book 2)... I Loved it. I stayed up till 1 am just to finish it and felt the need to run right out and get the next one, City of Glass. Clare has a gift for putting demons/vampires and the like in a new light. There is nothing I like more than some creativity in fantasy series. I will say that the entire book I sat hoping we would find out Clary and Jace were not brother and sister but thanks to some hints I'm thinking we will know for sure soon. My fingers are crossed for Clary because its strange enough finding out that your mother and father are demon slayers and you dad has turned evil. Being in love with your brother, thats just too much for any teenager to deal with. Not to mention gross (yuck).<br /><br />An even bigger problem arises when poor Simon is turned into a vampire! I mean talk about guilt getting your best friend turned into the un-dead. This has been a really bad few months as far as Clary's life goes. Now since her evil father Valentine is around making trouble things do not look like they are going to get any better in the near future, and they don't. Clary finds herself in the middle of an evil plan to have demons overthrow the Clave, and she, Jace and the rest of the Shadowhunters need to get it together and stop Valentine, and try to not get killed in the process.<br /><br />If you read the first book and liked it, then your probably like me and hooked. Get ready for some sleepless nights while you get through the next few books. They are totally worth it! I have to say this was my favorite book in the series. The characters really come to life and become people you truly feel for.
B004I744AS|5.0|exactly what I needed! the other features make it fun even when you're not looking up a word. easy to use and very helpful. would definitely recommend.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very interesting, a totally unexpected scenario, a very good story. Great  characters and the story keeps your interest, can't lay it down. Keep up the good work. I am waiting for the next installment's to see who the people were that created such havoc in the world, and what happens to the silo 17 and 18's people.
B004GGM444|5.0|I first heard Skrillex on Pandora. And immediately went to purchase the song, but decided on the whole album. Can't beat it for $5.99 What can I say! Its beats are outrageous!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Don't believe all the bad reviews you may have heard about this movie.  I truly enjoyed it.  But a word of caution:  If you have young children in your household, or if you are offended by cuss words and strong language, or if you are extremely religious, I would have advised bypassing this movie if it had not been for the fact that the movie makers have included what they call a \\"Family Audio Track\\" (all objectionable language removed).  All in all, I think this movie is a truly great visual and audio experience for anyone seeking something unique.  The case that this 3-DVD movie comes in is in itself unique.  It appears no expense was spared.  Considering the reasonable price I paid for this movie DVD set, in my opinion, it was a real bargain.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I am 20 years old and I remember watching this movie growing up with my dad.  Such a good movie, its one that defiantly sticks with you, even teaches you something.  The main character Mary is one well thought out character and a fantastic actor.  Has a lot of nature and scenery in it that's absolutely beautiful.

B004FGA2LC|5.0|This is a mature, sophisticated movie that deals with a subject (adultery) that, although unpleasant because it affects two unsuspecting, attractive in their own right spouses, it reflects real life. I kept being drawn back to the movie and have watched it several times. It probably has happened many times in real life in the same circumstances. Kristen Scott Thomas' character seemed willing to put her adulterous husband behind her because of 1)her daughter, 2) her very public position as a congresswoman and 3)maybe the relationship wasn't all that great to begin with.  The Harrison Ford character found it much more difficult to move on with his life because he \\"didn't have a clue\\" that his wife was cheating on him and he was paid as a policeman to know when people were lying to him.<br />In my mind, Scott Thomas gave a terrific performance, as usual. Two of her \\"speeches\\" were highlights in the movie: the phone call to Mr. Ford's recorder and her statement to the press as she left the hospital. The hospital statement summed up the movie in a brief, brilliant fashion.<br /><br />At the end, out of pain and disappointment came the possibility of happiness.<br />How many hours of great entertainment and story telling was given to us by Sydney Pollack?  Think of all the great movies that he produced and/or directed. He died too soon. I miss Sydney Pollack when I think of all the stories he had yet to tell.<br /><br />ps: The music in this movie is outstanding and played a big part in setting tone and mood.

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|and cinematography.  Actors not bad - I always love Judi Dench.  Unfortunately I bought the DVD before seeing the movie.  Didn't realize this is the Cliff Notes version.  I'll stick with Timothy Dalton and Toby Stephens.
0307959856|2.0|I have read all of Jane Austen's books and I have read most of PD James' books. I like both writers, but they are very different writers - different styles, different genres, different eras. I am not sure why PD James felt compelled to try to copy Jane Austen's style and write a sequel to Pride & Prejudice. Alas, it does not work. The Prologue is a rehash of P&P, using virtually the same phrases as Austen, so if you have read P&P you can skip this until the last couple of pages when James marries off younger sister, Mary. Then the narrative plods on and the characters change from who they were when Austen created them -- which is annoying if you liked those characters in P&P! What I found most tedious, though, were James' descriptions. A minor or irrelevant character is introduced in the midst of, say, polishing silver or serving tea, and then dismissed. Why didn't an editor get rid of these needless paragraphs? Austen didn't gratuitously include such descriptions. All of her words felt necessary. In a word, I found this novel to be tedious. I wish that PD James had stuck with what she does best - contemporary, fast-paced murder mysteries.
1576875776|1.0|I just got my book. i was so excited. I had gone into NYC to her show and was blown away. This was a complete let down. I have pages that are BLANK . Yep, nothing on the page. The colors are mud brown and grey not black and white. Very disappointed.

B0059XTUXQ|2.0|\\"The Iron Lady\\" is merely a mediocre, soulless highlights reel of Margaret Thatcher's life, lacking any substance or narrative cohesion. It's a platform for Streep's admittedly top-notch impersonation. I say \\"impersonation\\" rather than \\"performance' because the complete lack of depth to the film gives her no character arc and no dimension. It's Oscar bait at its least satisfying. You'll get more insight into Thatcher by reading her Wikipedia entry, and there's nothing in Streep's performance you didn't see in her Oscar clip. Check out an old episode of \\"Spitting Image\\" instead for a far more interesting take on Thatcher.

B0007939NO|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals because it is a slice of heaven where one lives a lifetime in 24 hours.  Gene Kelly and Cyd Charise are a beautiful couple and the music is enchanting.  the scenery and acting go hand-in-hand in a wonderful fantasy.  Also, Van Johnson's character remidns me when I was younger and concerned about the fastpace of today.  I have mellowed and fondly love wathcing this childhod favorite.  The restored version makes this a joy to watch. Check out the extras, you will love them.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie is based on the story of the Triple Crown Winner, Secretariat.  We learn how Miss Chenery has to overcome so much opposition from the men in her life to save the family horse farm after her Mother and Father pass away.  And we learn her resourcefulness in coming up with the funds to pay the inheritance tax.  One cannot help but root for Secretariat to win because all of the stories of the people involved become so alive in the film.  The acting is not stellar, actually sort of mediocre.  A neat detail towards the end is how we are shown an actual picture of the real Miss Chenery.  And in the bonus features she is interviewed in the segment about Secretariat.  This is the type of movie that makes Hollywood admired the world over.
0143038419|2.0|While it was written well enough, I just didn't find her appealing. I didn't feel sorry for her, her journey wasn't incredible to me. In my opinion, she was a typical selfish middle-aged woman nothing to write home about. The book was just ok to me. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it, and I found the book even more boring.
0439023483|3.0|This first book is a decent read, interesting concept, and moves at a good pace.  You get to know the characters enough to care and no parts are boring.<br /><br />However, be warned that this is the best book in the series by far and the plot and writing get worse and worse as you go to book 2 and then to book 3.  It starts to get very predictable and her writing's biggest weakness (describing some of the action scenes) shows up a lot in book 3 since there is a lot of action.<br /><br />So I'm warning you now that you may enjoy the first book and maybe the second, but if you start this series and read all three books you might end up disappointed overall like I was.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|When i first heard of this film I was afraid of schlock but I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a first-rate sci fi-action western that wroks because it does not fall into cliches.  It is original and has two fine performeances from Ford and Craig.  This is a solid film!
B005SFR7YE|1.0|Let me be frank, up front. I love this show and its music.  I have seen POTO over 25 times and this cast surpasses almost all others as an ensemble cast. (Yes, including Michael Crawford, my least favorite Phantom.)<br /><br />However, once again some young, overzealous film editor does not trust the performances, the director of the show, the music, the costumes and all other amazing aspects of this show enough to just let them be what they are. The editor cuts every 4 seconds to an arbitrary camera angle and no scene can be appreciated for its depth and staging which at many times looks like or should look like a painting,e.g., the frozen moment at the beginning of Masquerade. (Actually, it may not have been a real person doing the editing; it could have been done by a random number generator picking camera angles.) You would be better just to listen to the cd because the performances are top notch, the voices great, the orchestrations full and rich, the staging brilliant, but the constant change of camera angle creates an almost stroboscopic effect which might even cause seizures in many of us. Unfortunately, this has become the standard for filming live performances. My wish would be that when they put out a disc of a performance, they would offer an additional angle (something dvds and bds are able to do) of one stationary camera from the best seat in the house, just like it would be if you were actually attending a live production, and let the show be what it is. A good show does NOT need bizarre, haphazard, rapid fire cuts to make it exciting; the show itself is exciting.<br /><br />All of that said, how beautiful is Sierra Boggess' voice (Christine) \\"wishing you were somehow here again\\" and Ramin Karimloo (Phantom) who I saw in the London production of Love Never Dies; they are exciting and spectacular and the only reason to try to survive a viewing. Hadley Fraser (Raul) also does a fine job, actually better than I expected.(John Barrowman was decidedly thebest Raul ever.)<br /><br />The add-ons at the end are fun and make it worth renting and watching once, which is what I did--not quite as exciting as the casts from the Les Miz anniversary disc, but still fun to see. (Sarah Brightman is still good enough.)<br /><br />I will not be buying this myself; I have pre-ordered the Love Never Dies disc and I shudder to think what it might look like after having endured this editing nightmare.
B0063IH60K|1.0|15 second video after almost every deal, you have the option to skip the ad but it will be back on the next deal. I hoped that if I watched the whole thing thinking that would be it but no there it was the same boring video that I had no absolutely no interest in.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm quite fit (ish) - I swim, hike, swing kettle bells so thought I'd breeze through level 1.  I even used my 5kg weights to push me a bit harder, thinking it'd be a bit easy. But nothing prepared me for the after effects. It felt like a 2 hour work out and every single muscle in my body ached the next day. Had to give it a rest for two days but I'm about to give it another (more gentle) go. Seriously, ditch the expensive gym membership -  this is all you need.  I've never seen 'Biggest Loser' but I've heard about this DVD and now I know the reason.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is by far my favorite Mahjong game. Lots of different tile styles, options to play, patterns to solve. Love that you can highlight only the available tiles. It's too hard for me when I have to search for matches when all the tiles look the same! My kids (9 &amp; 12) love it too.

B006IDG2T6|2.0|I came into the book thinking I'd be further convinced that free will is an illusion but, after reading it, I'm more skeptical than I was before. Well, I learned a word for what I am -- compatibilist.<br /><br />To me, the more lucid and resonating arguments from the book came from Daniel Dennett and others Harris quotes in opposition to his thesis that we're puppets on unseen strings. I agree that consciousness is not ultimately in charge, but my CEO brain still retains the power to \\"deliberate and choose and act,\\" as I am doing with this review, or when I choose to say something sarcastic or not (and have done both), or whether to take advantage of the broken candy machine or not (and have done both). True, I don't inspire the urge to be sarcastic or steal a Snickers, but I have the ultimate say in whether I do it or not.<br /><br />Or is Harris really saying men who cheat have no say in the matter? He never brings up this scenario, but I guess if he feels murderers can't help themselves, neither can adulterers. I disagree. Men may be, for biological reasons, more prone to cheat, but that does not mean those who cheat do so unavoidably.<br /><br />Harris focuses somewhat on the extreme choice of murder, and seems to want to equate murderers with tumors in their brains to murderers who have unlucky genes, bad parents, and an unlucky environment. Well, we can see and remove the tumor in the former (though I still don't know what an apt form of justice would be to such a person), but what do we do to the person who kills for the fun of it? Could such a person be reformed? Could they develop enough willpower not to yield to the urge to kill? Isn't that a kind of free will, then?<br /><br />If there's no free will, how does anyone ever effectively diet? How does Alcoholics Anonymous work? How can one have the atoms to abuse alcohol and then never touch it again? The conscious self never makes a decision in any of this?<br /><br />Harris is right when he says we cannot go back in time to see how someone might have reacted differently, but we also can't see the situations where a store wasn't robbed, when a family wasn't murdered, when a home invader decided not to drop the bat on the patriarch's head. What in those situations? Is not beating someone with a bat still evidence of no free will? The genes just didn't have it in them at that time?<br /><br />Or maybe Harris and I agree more than I think, and we're just defining free will differently, because he does says that choices matter.<br /><br />And as a final criticism, the book did feel breezy, heavy on rhetoric, light on evidence and real world application. Harris brings up a couple of real world scenarios, but doesn't really develop or probe them in meaningful ways. The awful scenario he opens the book with never gets brought up again, for example. We're left to think Harris thinks what was done to that family was essentially unavoidable. The book feels like Harris spent a couple of weekends writing it.<br /><br />A book that treads some of the same ground, but with more efficacy, depth, rigor, and power to persuade, is Incognito. I'd recommend that book over this one.go back in time to see how someone might have reacted differently, but we also can't see the situations where a store wasn't robbed, when a family wasn't murdered, when a home invader decided not to drop the bat on the patriarch's head.

B006M4RN3U|1.0|When I was introduced to fun. in 2010 thanks to Amazon samples (thank you!), I quickly ordered \\"Aim and Ignite.\\"  Two years later I still consider it one of the best albums of the past decade.  Well-crafted pop music (in the best sense of that term) with great songwriting.  Were I to review it, it would be 5 stars.<br /><br />This record - not so much.  Every time I listen to this album the word that comes to mind is \\"Disney.\\"  I can't help thinking that it reminds me of Disney channel bubblegum - pop in it's worst form.  And I have to call out \\"It gets better\\" - so bad, it's painful.<br /><br />The elements of what made \\"aim & ignite\\" so amazing are still there, unfortunately they've been buried in a horrible attempt to hit the Top 40.<br /><br />If I could return it, I would.
0439023521|5.0|This book completely sucked me in from page one and barely allowed me to come up for air.  It is so fast-paced that there's hardly anywhere to pause to, say, go to sleep for the night or go to work for the day. Needless to say, I read it very rapidly despite working quite full days.<br /><br />I probably can't say anything others haven't already said or that most people at this point don't already know, but I still wanted to put my voice out there strongly recommending this series. It is indeed brutal and if you can't handle violence involving children (like my mother, who's the one who gave it to me to begin with), it's likely not for you. But that said, it is a fascinating view of a dystopian futuristic society and a girl unwittingly stirring rebellion.<br /><br />Katniss herself is likable while at the same time being very unsentimental, which I usually don't like. That was a nice surprise, to like her anyway. The other characters are similarly great and multi-dimensional. I liked the hints to a love story that begin in this first book. I can't WAIT to see the movie version as it's looks like they're doing a good job with it.<br /><br />Prior to starting this series, I had the assumption that the Hunger Games themselves would run the course of all three books. By the end of the first book I was left, like many I know of, wondering what on Earth the remaining two books would be about. Let's just say you'll have to find out for yourself - enjoy the ride!  (Just don't start reading it if you're going to have to put it down any time soon!)<br /><br />;)
B0071PS7AC|5.0|What are these people bitching about?  It's realistic in how the pins fly, has multiple options on how to throw, different difficulty levels, and great graphics.  One of my favorite apps for my Kindle Fire.  What would I change?  Add a beer frame.  ;)
0131479415|4.0|Good examples, well written chapters and the way the book is structured, all that give you a good and rather practical idea of how Agile PM should be performed. I have found it very elaborating and i should say I was pleased with my purchase.
0439023513|2.0|I didn't like how Katniss evolved in this book.  I was expecting her to be more active rather than reactive.  This book is well written and the themes and dilemmas it poses are deep and meaningful to society.  I think the prolblem I had with it is that it focused less on the individuals than the battles and strategies and horrors of war.  I appreciate the book; I just didn't get the enjoyment factor from it that I did from the first two.  It had a different feel to it and there were also events that felt staged rather than unfolding naturally in the first two books.  But my main problem with this book is that the characters seemed more like tools; plot devices than they did in the first two.  In the first two they felt real and endearing.
0439023491|5.0|This book pulled me in just as hard and fast as the first did. Like another review I read, I literally was talking to the book throughout - I know exactly what the other reviewer meant of shouting, \\"Oh no - I can't believe they're going to do THAT to them!!\\"  I thought the plot and every detail of what happened was brilliant and brilliantly executed by the author.<br /><br />To me it felt like even more happened progress-wise in this middle book than what happened in the first book, though I see from other reviews that some readers would not agree with that. On the political unrest front, on the love story front, on the development of Katniss' character, I felt we went far in this book, and I was able to put it down about as much as I was able to put down the first book, which is to say, not at all.<br /><br />This book definitely leaves you hanging more than the first one. The first leaves you craving the second because it's so amazing, but it is at least an ending. The second leaves you craving the third because it literally leaves you right in the middle with no resolution to what is actively going on at that moment. That's perhaps one thing I would change, but that is not enough to detract from my five-star rating.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has done it again!
B000ZBPPWC|4.0|Bartok: String Quartets 1-6 is a 2008 EMI Records Ltd. recording starring the Belcea Quartet. Having listened to Emerson String Quartets recording prior to this one, I must say that the former is better. The playing is good but the passion is lacking. The playing style is a bit lackadascial and could use some more passion for the music. Rob Cowan has written extensive and interesting music notes. Far from a bad recording but not a top notch one either. A well deserved four out of five. 4/5.

B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book. I thought it would be funnier; I chuckled once or twice while reading, but that was it.  I also thought it was boring - not much happened that was worth writing about.  The best part for me was when she wrote about playing the part of Sarah Palin for SNL. The only reason I finished this book was that it was selected by the book club I belong to.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I started Level 1 a little over a week ago and really liked the intensity and wondered how I was going to get to Level 2 but in her video Jillian says it over and again that the only way you are going to progress is to push yourself and force your body to do more.  Well I started Level 2 just a few days ago and it's hard and I am not able to do all of it consistantly yet, but I am pushing myself and I can tell you that I do see my waist line becoming more defined and an hour glass shape is appearing.  My arms are going to be ready for the sleevless tops this summer!!  I am excited to stick with it and see more results. I am already thinking about Level 3!<br />I really like the way she mixes up the cardio with the strength training.  You are always engaging your lower body with the upper body which gives you the results quicker.<br />I am thinking of purchasing her new Body Revolution series, it looks to be quite a challenge.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I wasn't really sure what to expect. I've always thought Cindy C was a beautiful woman with an enviable (and healthy-looking) figure, but most celebrity workouts I've previewed have left me feeling somewhat less than \\"worked out.\\" Being a Midwestern girl with a similarly proportioned body to Cindy's (I'm 5'10\\") I thought I'd give this a go and see what it did for me.<br /><br />The Next Challenge is, indeed, a challenge. The very first time I used it (when I was admittedly really out of shape) I was sore EVERYWHERE. Even now that I'm an intermediate exerciser, I'll still feel a burn if I haven't used it in a while. You'll work every part of your body in sets that range from plyometric lunges, karate kicks, weighted arm work, even a sumo move.  This is hard work, but it's made manageable. There are frequent water breaks, something not common in the \\"Go, Go, GO!\\" mentality of a lot of exercise videos. Both Cindy and her fitness trainer, Radu, have calm, professional demeanors that don't bully you or excessively cheerlead. Instead, you feel like you're with a workout buddy at the gym. From an aesthetic viewpoint, this is one beautifully shot video, and the soundtrack is surprisingly good.<br /><br />A couple caveats: The cardio section does elevate your HR for later sets, but you'll still want to supplement other cardio in your routine. Also, if you have any knee issues, some of the leg moves (like lunge scissors) are pretty high-impact. You may want to preview this section of the routine before trying it.<br /><br />I now use this tape regularly in my rotations, especially during the winter when it's hard to go out for a run. Because of the extensive weight work on the arms, chest, and shoulders, I don't use this DVD two days in a row, but I've still gotten results. I'd like to see more exercise DVDs released soon that incorporate the more modern moves like planks with the beautiful locations and music of these videos. But this oldie is still a goodie.

B005HSG3U6|3.0|I ordered this a few weeks back because I was looking for an inexpensive and durable case for my kindle fire. This one is slim, and fits perfectly on my device. The colored half of the case is a hard plastic and the black flap is fabric with these hard pieces on it to protect the front. I wouldn't suggest testing out the case by dropping it or anything but it keeps your kindle protected from normal misshaps. The biggest problem I have with it was that the front flap is suppose to flip around to act like a stand so you can prop your kindle up but mine never stays up, it always slips.
B006UG90RM|3.0|It's so refreshing hearing that Roth vocal bite mixed with Eddie's guitar fire again. Damn, that feels good. After decades we finally almost get a real Van Halen album...almost...but without Mike Anthony's harmonies, no cigar.<br />Make it magic, guys: get Mike's backing vocals in where they belong.<br />Yeah, I know: so many hard feelings, yada, yada. Now go listen to that first VH album and tell me that isn't worth whatever effort it takes to repeat.<br />No one is getting any younger here. Time to put down the egos and put up the music. Do it while you can.<br />Imagine how much Maca and Ringo would give now to get to do one more gig (just one more) with John and George.

B0068VZQCC|5.0|I have become quite a big Blind Guardian fan over the last 3 or 4 years.  The first album I ever got from them was Nightfall in Middle Earth.  And while I do like that album a lot, still the passive mix always held me back from considering it the classic that many do.  I know if the rhythm guitars had been mixed at the level of say 'Mirror Mirror' from this album than it would definitely be my favorite BG album too!  I am a bit of an unconventional fan as the album 'A Twist in the Myth' (a disappointing album to a lot of longtime fans) really got me into the band further.  Not familiar with the bands earlier works at the time, it was the first time I had heard the band with a nice crunchy guitar tone that I was used to hearing from bands like Iced Earth, Nevermore, Brainstorm, etc...  And aside from that fact I really think the songs are great too and it's one of my personal favorites.  I know that may leave many fans scratching their heads but I just wanted to lay out my personal perspective of where I am coming from and how I got into the band.  Since that time I have bought all of BG albums accept the first 2.  Somewhere far Beyond has become another one of my favorites as well.  With that said here are my thoughts of each song on this album.  I have the 2 cd version.<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />1.  Imaginations From the Other Side - One of my all time favorite BG tracks and it's nice to hear this song cleaned up a bit.  This album had a bit of a muddy production and this remix is much clearer so it's easier on the ears when you crank up the volume!  Also the leads where brought up during the chorus adding a cool dimension not heard on the original.<br /><br />2.  Nightfall - Not one of my favorite songs from BG.  Would have liked to have heard another faster, heavier song with the remix treatment.  Being more of a mellow ballad type song it benefits little from the remix anyhow?<br /><br />3.  Ride Into Obsession - Probably my 2nd favorite song after 'Voice inthe Dark' from their latest album 'At the Edge of Time'.  Good choice for the 'best of aspect' but since the production was pretty good on the last album the remix is hardly noticeable.  The guitars do sound slightly less polished with more bite so perhaps a slight improvement?<br /><br />4.  Somewhere Far Beyond - Great song choice, remix is good but the production on this album was killer in the first place so this is one that I actually prefer the original better.<br /><br />5.  Majesty - The only song from there very first album, which I don't have.  Without comparing I can only assume this one sounds much cleaner, anyway and I do like the song.<br /><br />6.  Traveler in Time - From the album 'Tales from the Twilight World' definitely cleaned up and a pretty good song from that album.<br /><br />7.  Follow the Blind - Title track from that album.  Since I don't own I can't really say how this version compares.  A song I found to be good just not great.<br /><br />8.  The Last Candle - I like the song choice here.  Again cleaned up from the original and is a very good song from this album.<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />1.  Sacred Worlds - This one is the original version.  On here for the 'best of aspect'.  I would imagine this one would be a nightmare to remix with all of the orchestral elements and really does not need a remix cause it already sounds great.<br /><br />2.  This Will Never End - Great song choice!  One of my favorites from this great and under-rated album IMO.  Again I can't tell a big difference between this and the original (since this song is fairly recent) but another one of my absolute favorite BG tracks!<br /><br />3.  Valhalla - Ok one of the completely re-recorded tracks.  Not owning 'Follow the Blind' I had not heard this song before.  But immediately after hearing this I was blown away!  I now count this among my favorite BG songs and this was a brilliant choice to redo.  I even like the production on this song better than on their mostrecent album 'At the Edge of Time'.  The guitars have more bite and it is a little less polished sounding.  One of the songs that really make this album a worthy purchase!<br /><br />4.  Bright Eyes - The second song choice from the Imaginations album.  While I do like this song, I would have preferred 'Born in a Mourning Hall' or 'Another Holy War' to be the choice.<br /><br />5.  Mirror Mirror - Yes, now this is how this song should sound!  The rhythm guitars finally match the intensity that this song brings.  One of BG's all time great songs.  It's heavy, fast, and intense and the guitars were seriously beefed up to reflect this!  I guess if I could only pick one song from this album to be remixed this would be the one.  So I am very happy at least for this song which along with Valhalla make this album a must have!  Now if they would only remix the entire Nightfall album this heavy it might be my favorite album ever!<br /><br />6.  Bard Song Forest - Uh Oh...what happened here?  Bad choice to re-record this one.  The original was timeless, well recorded, and had that authentic feel of sitting around the campfire as if the band were actually there performing with just there acoustic guitars.  In the re-recorded version the acoustic guitars are barely audible while other background and artificial elements drive the song.  It sounds so overly polished and pristine that you could image this song being played around Christmas time while shopping at a popular department store.  I just skip this one and pretend I never heard it!<br /><br />7.  Bard Song Hobbit - In contrast to the Forest, they actually did a great job of re-recording this one.  Sounds almost identical to the original but does not surpass it which begs the question of why re-record this one at all?  Like I mentioned before this album already had a killer production.  But hey at least they did not butcher this one.  It's got that same good guitar crunch like Valhalla.<br /><br />8.  And Then There Was Silence - Ok I have to admit I never liked this song much before and I don't like the re-recorded one either.  I know tons of BG fans clamor over it but honestly it never clicked with me.  It just sounds very disjointed like a bunch of unrelated parts are copied and pasted all over the place.  Well told you I am a bit of an unconventional BG fan.<br /><br />Overall this is a worthy purchase IMO for the reasons above.  The song choices were pretty good but definitely could have been better.  Here is a list of my snubs that should have been included.<br /><br />Somewhere Far Beyond - Ashes to Ashes, Time What is Time, Journey Through the Dark, all of these from a 'best of aspect'<br /><br />Imaginations From the Other Side - Born in a Mourning Hall, Another Holy War<br /><br />Nightfall in Middle Earth - The Curse of Feanor, When Sorrow Sang, Thorn, Into the Storm<br /><br />Night at the Opera - Under the Ice, Sadly Sings Destiny, Wait for an Answer<br /><br />A Twist in the Myth - Lionheart, Turn the Page, Fly<br /><br />At the Edge of Time - Voice in the Dark, Valkyries, Control the Divine

0062073567|5.0|I am not certain that Agatha Christie was the first to write a novel in the way this one was written, but she certainly did it well! Having Dr. Sheppard write the novel on behalf of Hercule made this a treasure, and the story is revealed one page at a time. (I guess that sounds silly, but sometimes authors do jump around, and Agatha Christie does not).<br /><br />All of the clues are in place, the story is told in completeness, almost, but only Hercule Poirot can untangle the final story and reveal to us what his brain cells have already told him.<br /><br />While the Agatha Christie stories are now dated, if you have not read this particular novel of hers, I do recommend it as one of her best.
B004N6369Y|2.0|Don't bother with this Danielle Steele novel - what a waste of time! She is very repetitive as others have stated, and the plot is nonexistent. I made it through 25% of the book, then deleted it from my kindle. I think I could have written a better novel - what happened to the great Danielle Steele books?? Oh, and the writing is terrible - where was the editor on this???
0812992792|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son was an amazing read.  It was one of those rare novels that was truly transporting.  I believe that fiction can provide a unique perspective that's rarely available elsewhere.  This book greatly helped me to get a better grasp on this little understood country and what it must be like for the people who live with hunger, fear, and the madness of trying to refit a horrifying reality to the twisted whims of tyranny.<br /><br />The first half of the book introduces us to Pak Jun Do, a loyal citizen of the DPRK, who unquestioningly does what he must to survive and advance in society, including some pretty awful things.  It's not enough and he becomes another victim of the regime.<br /><br />The structure of the book shifts dramatically in the second half of the book where the narrative fragments (and can be confusing) between Jun Do who now goes by another name, an interrogator, and official propaganda, reflecting the change in the protagonist's own view of his world.  Ultimately, Jun Do earns a measure of redemption.<br /><br />I'm recommending it to all my friends who read.
B004GYY714|5.0|I am in college and away from home it is nice to have some home music that I know of, best part is that it is free
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Just received this yesterday, needed a external mic to use with a inexpensive Kodak PlayTouch digital video camera. The camera's built-in mic picks up every little noise in the room when recording, including air handlers, wall clocks etc. In addition, the built-in mic is way too boomy, with that \\"I'm down here in the well\\" sound. As I am primarily looking at using the camera for quick and dirty video podcasts and online video reviews, this just wouldn't cut it.<br /><br />The ATR-3350 seems well made for general purpose use around the house/studio and beyond with reasonable care. Best of all, it sounds great. Using the lapel clip to place the mike on my collar, the audio comes through loud, clear and intellegible. It picks up just my voice, and no other peripheral sounds in the room. Post-production audio editing should be minimal, if at all.<br /><br />The Kodak PlayTouch has a bad reputation when using external mics, most people report extremely low volume and inadequate levels even when the camera recording level is topped out. My initial tests show acceptable results with the ATR-3350, though you still have to top out the camera recording level. The next test will be using it with my higher-end Canon Vixia camcorder, I'm sure it will work even better there.<br /><br />For people complaining about the cord length or the battery compartment, stop it. The cord needs to be long, I'm normally about six feet (or more) away from my camera, this cord is long enough to be routed up inside your pants and shirt to be unobtrusive on camera. Add the length running across the floor and up the tripod, it's just about perfect. If you need it shorter, use a tiewrap or velcro wrap. The battery compartment is fine too, I have big fingers and had no trouble installing the LR44 battery inside. Taking it out is just as easy, you just pop it out using a small nail file or penknife.<br /><br />All in all I'm pleased with this mic for the ridiculously low price I paid. I think you will be too, give it a try.be too, give it a try.
B000002HHB|4.0|Tigerlily is a pretty good album, even now being a few years old.  I used to own a copy, lost it, just bought a new copy and enjoyed it all over again.  Natalie Merchant's vocals are strong and clear and very enjoyable examples of storytelling in music lyrics, though I think she tends toward the emotive rather than the painting of pictures.  In the end I didn't care about this, as her emotional range is broad, and her songs cover a range of subjects.<br /><br />The instrumentals were also enjoyable, though I didn't hear much here that breaks new ground (think Alanis Morisette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" for contrast), and they tend toward softer sounds that provide backdrop for the lyrics to take place.  This album is not trying to be raw, it is trying for the most part to be soothing (\\"Beloved Wife\\" being one of the exceptions).  These songs are crooned rather than rocked, and if you're in the right mood, this is quite pleasing to listen to.  I gave the album four stars because in general I like edgier music, which only a few songs on this album aspire to.<br /><br />By now just about everyone has heard \\"Carnival\\", and I think it's the best song on the album.  Her lyrics are evocative, even if they leave you a little puzzled about what she's driving at.  I had that problem with the entire album, the images are strong but the lyric-stories don't feel complete, somehow.  They conjure a mood but not a whole story.  Overall, though, I think this is a strong album, full of pleasing sounds and potent imagery.  It's pleasant to listen to and easy on the ears, suitable to slow days with some time on your hands to let Ms. Merchant fill your mind with pictures and her soft notes.
0375507256|5.0|I came to this book having read The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet.  I was impressed with Mitchell's ability to create such unique voices.  I enjoyed inhabiting those characters and their worlds, so I randomly picked Cloud Atlas as my next Mitchell read.<br /><br />I had no idea of the book's unique structure when I began.  It was initially dismaying and disorienting to move from one story to the next with the unresolved tension of each story building upon the other in the first half of the book.  In this sense it was an uphill read, but when I reached the 6th (and middle) story, the book began unwinding all that tension and it was a gloriously downhill from there.<br /><br />The 6 stories are stitched together by obvious threads referencing each previous story.  In this way the stories are sewn together, but there are broader themes that make the novel a cohesive work.  The themes are stratified differently in the stories and work to varying degrees.<br /><br />The book is not for everyone, but a patient reader with an appreciation for unique structure, vibrant characterization, and an author who can adeptly play with style and genre will likely enjoy this book.  This is one of the most interesting and beautifully written books I've read in the last year.
B002JVWRAE|5.0|This is a great show. With the general exception of the first three or so episodes, every episodes is interesting, enthralling, & exciting. The acting is superb, the first of many things that set it apart from Twilight. Another is that the characters have more, well, character. The villains in this series are particularly amazing. The feel of the show is a bit dark most of the time. Sometimes very dark. Expect a lot of death. Especially in the first season, someone dies pretty much every episode. There are several surprises throughout the season, some of them are particularly shocking. The chemistry between the leads is spot-on, both the romantic relationships, and the other, subtler relationship of brothers.<br /><br />Newcomers should keep in mind that this is intended as a teen show, though its quite popular among other demographics. That said, if you like adventure and a bit of meat to your love stories, then this is a great show for you. You'll find yourself hooked.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray release is a good buy - I would recommend it or the DVD over any digital purchase for the most part.

1400079144|3.0|I read this book a while ago as a follow-up to the DaVinci Code and have been meaning to review it for some time. This one features a maniac who is a master of ancient symbology and will stop at nothing to fulfill his own fate-dealt prophecy -- and he definitely gives the master symbologist, Robert Langdon, a run for his money.  Whereas it had as many twists and turns as DaVinci Code, I would say it's almost as good but not quite as good as the blockbuster.  But I would still recommend it as a great suspense novel.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This was a great concert - I had heard several of the songs before, and was vaguely familiar with the story, but had never seen the play in any form. This concert sparked a much greater interest in musicals than I previously had. The cast was superb, the performances dazzling - Alfie was absolutely stunning. I cried several times during the production, and found myself rewatching it almost constantly for a week. It was a wonderful tribute to the musical, and well worth the purchase.<br /><br />A small warning: this is a concert performance. As I've not seen the actual play, I can't say what dialogue or songs may be missing, but the acting in this performance is minimal - the cast stand at microphones throughout the concert. It was not intended to be a full performance. That said, it was a great introduction to the musical for me - I had no problem keeping up with the plot despite only having been acquainted with the storyline in the loosest sense of the word.

0553386794|1.0|Writing as someone who read The Lord of the Rings at least once a year for more than a decade, whose fantasy and science fiction book collection surpasses  two thousand volumes, I have to say, Game of Thrones is pretty bad. The idea is passable, GRRM has planted the wars of the roses into a cookie-cutter \\"fantasy\\" world. He has his Yorks, The Starks, and Lancasters, The Lannisters (no need to be anything but blatant, it seems). And so much of the book is every bit as thinly imagined as his character names (except the page count). His characters are painfully one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. His plot points are telegraphed from light years away, and part of that is simply the fact that his plot lines are cribbed from a hundred other sources and not one of them is particularly clever. He has chosen to employ that most abused form of literary hackism, mis-spelling common words to make them \\"fantasy\\" words: Ser instead of Sir, and so on. Unfortunately, this doesn't translate very well to the screen since they are homonyms which, when spoken, sound the same. And this book was so obviously written for the small screen. Much like the worst of Michael Crichton, this book is written in a series of set pieces, just short enough to fill the slots between commercials. Each scene follows the last like a line of dominoes all set up to be knocked down in the most obvious fashion imaginable. Odd that it was picked up for HBO which has no need for regular commercial breaks.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, GRRM is not a bad writer. His use of language is competent, he isn't clumsy (except for the silly spelling thing), he keeps things flowing. It's just that he keeps things flowing to places that are simply not very interesting and never, ever unexpected. It's like he was writing to a schedule. Every character gets betrayed on the story beat, by just the people you knew would do it. Every character is oblivious to the things the author has set up for them to be oblivious to. It's like watching a bad slasher flick, you want to yell, \\"Don't go out there!\\" And yet they do go out there and they get killed as you knew they would, and never in particularly interesting ways. The bad guys are smarmy and Eeeeeeeviiiiil and the good guys are stalwart and honorable (which is always their downfall). And the good guys never see the bad guys for what they are even though they practically wear signs that say. \\"Don't believe a word I say, I am clearly lying.\\" The main hero can't predict the obvious outcome of his actions even though a four year old could see it coming. Sigh. It's like watching a film where a character says, \\"I think we'll be safe now.\\" You KNOW that's the kiss of death. Every time the main hero decides to trust someone, what a shock, he gets betrayed.<br /><br />And about the length. Good Lord, man, edit yourself. Have you ever heard of a three act structure? A book isn't everything you can imagine. It has a purpose: to tell a specific story. You're not writing Gibbon. You ARE allowed to edit and leave bits out if they don't advance the plot and develop character. Look, I know that ever since LOTR publishers practically DEMAND that every fantasy novel be written in three volumes. And since Harry Potter, a seven hundred page volume is de rigueur. Heck, it's practically considered a novella these days. But please, just because you have tons of potential space to fill does not means you HAVE to fill it. How is it that Terry Pratchett achieves in 300 pages what you utterly fail to do in 3,500? Editing. Story. Plot. Character.<br /><br />I finished the book, but I did sort of skim through the last third. I will definitely not be buying the rest of the series.watching a bad slasher flick, you want to yell, \\"Don't go out there!\\" And yet they do go out there and they get killed as you knew they would, and never in particularly interesting ways.

0525423281|5.0|Lola Nolan's New Year's resolution was to never wear the same outfit twice.<br /><br />She wants to attend the winter formal dressed like Marie Antoinette, but not quite. She wants a wig so big a bird could live in it. She wants a dress so wide that she'll need to enter through a set of double doors. She also wants everyone to see that she's punk-rock tough under the frills when they notice her platform combat boots.<br /><br />She wants her parents to approve of her boyfriend, Max. Sure, Max is twenty-two and Lola is seventeen. But so what? Her father Nathan was significantly younger than her other dad, Andy, when they started dating. Isn't that further proof that Max is the one. Not so much according to Nathan and Andy.<br /><br />Lola also never ever ever wants to see the Bell twins ever again. Ever.<br /><br />When a moving truck rolls up next door, Lola realizes she isn't going to get what she wants. Not where the Bell twins are concerned anyway.<br /><br />After steamrolling through Lola's life two years ago, Cricket Bell--aspiring inventor and snappy dresser--is back along with his talented, figure-skating twin sister Calliope. While Calliope chases an elusive spot at the Olympics, Cricket is starting college and seems to be chasing . . . Lola.<br /><br />But Lola doesn't care about Cricket anymore. She wants different things now. Things like her boyfriend Max and her Marie Antoinette dress. And that's enough.<br /><br />Except it really isn't. After years spent wanting to never see the boy next door ever again, Lola is starting to wonder if she's been wanting all of the wrong things in Lola and the Boy Next Door (2011) by Stephanie Perkins.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a companion to Perkins' debut novel Anna and the French Kiss.* (Readers of both books might recognize some characters from the first book in this one but it's most definitely a standalone if you want it to read this one first.)<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed Anna and her story, I loved Lola so much more. With her vibrant outfits and quirky personality Lola is all win.

B005RUUUAI|5.0|I am huge zombie/end of world fan and have totally fallen in love with this show and all of the people! (Especially Norman Reedus, Daryl, OMG!) He is an amazing actor and can't wait for them to develop him even more in the show! I know it has that soap opera feel but that helps to make it seem real. The show is not all zombies walking around everywhere all the time and that helps to draw you into the \\"family\\" feel of the show (as in this group is a family of sorts). I do not want them to make Carl into a bad kid though, they need some sense of normalcy and he can bring it eventually.<br />I would like to see more of the fall of Atlanta and even more about what the Dr told Rick at the end of season 1, maybe take an excursion to the greater Atlanta area to get supplies or something. Maybe even another group of people like this group in another area, and develop the show where they meet up. Could be interesting. Open some kind of door that can bring others into this show, other people would surely try to settle down in surrounding farms? Maybe even some neighbors that Hershell and Maggie know.<br />Anyway, I just wanted to say that this show is awesome and it was worth every dime to me to be able to watch it on my desk top at home. No way can I wait for season 2 to hit the shelf! Season 3??? CANNOT WAIT!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I liked some of the games but others were pointless. lack of directions for each game made it. challenging at times. definitely would reccommend reading some of the reviews to see the pros and cons
B0071XO8RA|5.0|WOW.<br /><br />I always look for something new, fun and different.  I'm usually let down, and end up going back to some long space-opera series.  THESE STORIES ARE SO MUCH FUN TO READ!  If you like reading like I do-- epic stories, just get all the books at once.  They read like one story so very easily.  The story is new, dark and so weird-- yet so believable.  If you liked the old fashioned \\"Twilight Zone\\" mixed with something new like the \\"Lost\\" series this is gunna be good for you.  I have recommended this story to many of my friends-- and I haven't done anything like that in a long time.  I would love to see this story continue for a long time to come.  It has so much potential!  GREAT READ!  BUY IT!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Its very easy to use! The ONLY thing that would make it better would be if you didn't have to use Internet access.
B006CC0YB0|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />Mark Lanegan Band's new album BLUES FUNERAL might just as well be called \\"How Lanegan Got His Groove Back.\\" It has been eight long years since the last release, but as his followers know, their favorite whiskey-voiced singer has been anything but static during all that time.  Collaborative albums with Isobel Campbell, Greg Dulli, and Soulsavers, as well as contributions to albums with Queens of the Stone Age and Twilight Singers, have all combined in a well of inspiration from which to draw for BLUES FUNERAL.<br /><br />\\"Gravedigger's Song\\" takes off right from the gate, laying down a driving beat that signals the beginning of a different Mark Lanegan experience - not since his days with Screaming Trees has he opened an album with this kind of urgency, or so freely offered some songs (\\"Grey Goes Black,\\" \\"Riot In My House,\\" \\"Quiver Syndrome\\") that could have sounded at home on one of that band's unborn albums.  While lines like \\"If tears were liquor I'd have drunk myself sick\\" and the freaky feel and imagery of tracks like \\"Leviathan\\" remind us this is still the world of indie rock noir that fans love, it's Lanegan's electro-pop surprises that fascinate.  Notice how his down-in-the-ditch voice rises to float so easily over a boom-slap dance track like \\"Ode to Sad Disco.  This kind of thing may split his fan base, but maybe the naysayers should just go to music hell along with the guy that yelled \\"Judas!\\" at Royal Albert Hall and everyone that ever booed Dylan when he plugged in his guitar.<br /><br />If previous Lanegan solo efforts seemed like walks through dark and twisted woods, then this his latest outing plays like a midnight flight over the entire forest.  On Blues Funeral Mark Lanegan finally spreads his gargoyle wings and takes flight, and in the process drops his richest and most satisfying album since WHISKEY FOR THE HOLY GHOST.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
B00729GQ0A|4.0|Ms. Hamilton starts us off in a small town near Denver, Colorado. Sophia is on shift at a local diner, trying to drown out the buzz in her head with Pink Floyd. The effort is thwarted when a Christian cult leader demands to pay her check and leave before the secular music corrupts her.<br /><br />There's already so much world building here. The buzz is a hook, and Mrs. Franklin's audacity sweetens the deal. There's no way I'd put this book down, so the first page is a winner. And the rest of the chapter has a lot to offer the New Adult audience.<br /><br />Sophia is a college graduate with a BA in History, looking for a job teaching that she can't find. She needs experience to get a job and needs a job for experience. It's THE catch-22 of Generations X, Y, and Z (or whatever they're called). There is a missing piece here, and I applaud Ms. Hamilton for leaving it out. Many liberal arts fields...history included...are stepping stones toward graduate degrees. Most students don't know when they declare these majors that they will need additional schooling to put their education to work. Even teaching will require certification, which involves more school. Many, like Sophia, will find themselves back home four years later, waiting tables or something. I find Sophia's frustration at not being able to find a job, and ignorance of what her education has actually qualified her to do in the workforce, to be incredibly realistic.<br /><br />In addition, doing something rash to put an end to something you just can't take anymore, that's a very relatable, too.<br /><br />The Forever Girl spans six months of Sophia's life, during which she battles a family curse, loses a dear friend, picks up a hot guy that she resists committing to, and wrestles with issues that most of us would need a therapist, (or a grandmother), to untangle. But, that's really just the window dressing. Sophia's story is an exhaustive exploration of acceptance. Innocents are hung for witchcraft to calm fears and satiate jealousy. Grudges and wishes are carried for desperate centuries in vain. A ruling council of immortals lay down a strict law that on its surface protects humans, but underneath designed to upset the balance of universe. And Sophia herself, who bristles at the persecution of her neighbors for her Wiccan faith, must learn to trust things she doesn't understand and embrace herself for who she really is.<br /><br />Ms. Hamilton illustrates this evolution by having Sophia make foreshadowing observations about herself. My favorite is when the young woman realizes that she wants nothing to do with Charles' world, but everything to do with him, and that she can't have both. But that world wants her, for a lot of reasons good and bad, to the same degree that our world, which she holds onto for months, wants her gone. Ms. Hamilton threads the supernatural through every page, every subplot, so when she pulls that string toward the end, Sophia's life turns completely inside out. Sophia leaves our world behind, and the supernatural world becomes home. It's ironic, then, that this transition actually has less to do with Charles than with her. Without giving away too much, the supernatural world has been hers longer than it has been his, so I find the fact that she wanted nothing to do with it rather poignant.<br /><br />There are twists and turns in this book, and many of them in the final chapters. With the progression of reveals at the end...and my personal affection for snowballing climaxes...I enjoyed the pace. Things about the world that weren't quite settled for me fell in to place. Charles, who had some flat spots until the end, finally rounded out for me. Most important for the first book in a series, it ended in a place that resolves the first set of conflicts while setting up the story and major players of book two nicely. All in all, it was a very satisfying ending to a fresh, creative story.and satiate jealousy. Grudges and wishes are carried for desperate centuries in vain.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|Good movie, blast from my childhood. I remember being scared out of my mind watching these, although I haven't seen the last one yet.
B005DOKL3E|3.0|i bought a kinlde fire and looking at all the accessories i decided it would need a case or cover. so for 25.00 i bought this cover - what a waste of money!! it is nothing more than a cover - a cheap cover that i could have made for pennies!! i just thought for that much there would be some more protection or something! and the color is nothign more than a fadded red. save your money - i'm sure u have an old purse u could use!
B0052U59F4|1.0|This book is horrible, I've written better stories in high school. If the phrase \\"oh my\\" was used one more time, I think<br />I would have gone mad.  Waste of time and money-  I would have been more entertained reading \\"Jack & Jill\\".
B006P3HXZG|5.0|Can't help myself from loving this cat. The story line was entertaining for both the kids and adults alike. As for the 3D, has good depth, but nothing great for pop outs. I wanted this movie no matter what so I have to say that I am satisfied with the puchase. I will say though that this is not a 3D movie to show off your tv capabilites. Buy the movie for the story with the added 3D depths not for the 3D alone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app definitely helps you pass long periods of time. There are lots of original style games to help you dissolve your boredom. The only bad part is that it can take a while to get enough coins to unlock new games.
B004P98QZ8|2.0|This review is not based on product play as yet but on its contents: my son follows Ninjago, not me, and in casual conversation (AFTER we bought this set for his upcoming birthday, of course) he mentions the Fire Temple is \\"old\\" Ninjago. That is, it has the \\"old\\" skeleton villains, not the \\"new\\" or transformed or whatever snake villains with their \\"cool\\" outfits, weapons, etc. Thought that was a detail would-be purchasers might want to know.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|it's a really cook game to kick back with and just chill. love it.  come join me. people of all ages will love it to.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game works really great. Works perfect on my kindle fire. It is the best. If you want Solitaire you whole really get this one!!
B007BLCGNU|1.0|If you were fighting communist then Hollywood hates you. The crossdressing allegation though brought up by an enemy in a Kitty Kelly style book  without basis and rejected even by his enemies is now TRUTH.  And Hollywood can attack the man with no basis.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|I am a fan of The End of Faith, The Moral Landscape, and most recently Lying. I had great expectations in this book after folowing his blog and his many debates. I was glad to see him tackle this subject. However, at times throughout the book I felt he made very myopic claims where his logic contradicted itself. At one point he claims that his view of determinism is not fatalism, but makes every attempt to clarify by telling the reader how they ultimately are being steered regardless of how one feels proximately. He should have spent far more time writing this book and elaborated with atleast a hundred more pages. for example, he admits that the during the studies of observing behavior after the subjects understood they had no free will they behaved deviantly and out of character. He claims that this is no reason to hide the truth and doesn't think his readers will behave in such a manner. Ok, sure...but why? I think this could be a serious implication but is easily pushed aside for reasons of principle and assumption. Harris does touch base on this lightly in  the section on morality, but again falls short in convincing an audience that is curious to see where such views come from.<br />The reason i still gave it three stars is because as subject matter, it is a very important concept to comprehend. He presents great questions from a field that will have a huge affect on humanity as it becomes more accurate. Just as an introduction to the topic to rattle someones notions of free will, I would recommend it.
B0060Q962Q|3.0|Simple draught drop game, very simple and clean. If you want a classic and need a quickie logic game this will fill that small void.
0857680986|5.0|This is probably one of the top 5 books you should get if you wish to learn to draw well.  Loomis has a style that may seem dated, but that's irrelevant.  What's important is the information Loomis gives.  If you wish to learn the figure, couple this with Bridgman, Bammes, and Vanderpoel and maybe a good anatomy book and that's all you need.  This is information that has been lost to art education for a very long time.  I'm excited to see them reprint all of Loomis' books.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|An amazing game, great storyline, and neat n crisp graphics all come together to make this app game the best. If only you could keep your weapons throughout the whole game, it would have been even better. Still, I give the game a 6 out of 5.
B0060Q962Q|5.0|one of the best free app of the day, simple classic game. works well on a motorola atrix (tegra 2).
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise.  It was uplifting, encouraging, motivating, and refreshing!  Highly recommended!  The importance of fathers has been minimized since the \\"feminist movement\\", and the result has been devastating to families.  We have left men feeling lost and unsure of what their role is in this modern society.  This movie reminds us of the powerful influence for good that fathers can and should be for their wives and their children.  I did not find it preachy at all.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is okay, but I am stuck and for the likes of me I cannot figure the rest out, Help. I wish there were some hints. Does anyone knows what is in the Freezer? In what order should I put the colors that are on the Globe in and how should I line up the birds that are on the fireplace? What about the clock and gum ball machine?
B000N3T0DM|5.0|I saw this film a few years ago & for some reason I couldn't forget it.  Seeing it again I remembered why--it is a great experience.  Volver translates to \\"coming back.\\"  Penélope Cruz won Best Actress in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival [it also won best screenplay].  She was also nominated for an Academy Award.<br /><br />PROs:<br />Genre transcends being categorized:  drama, thriller, mystery<br />Outstanding direction by Pedro Almodóvar<br />Excellent cinematography & screenplay<br />Performances were all top-notch<br />Truly European film with no holds barred:  nudity, death, high emotions, buried family secrets [Not an American film that wraps everything up in a nice package]<br />Cruz's loser husband Paco uses the classic line \\"I'll do all the work\\" [I thought only American men use that line--apparently Europeans too]<br />Helped me brush up on my Spanish<br /><br />CONs:<br />This is an early blu-ray so some edge-enhancement is noticable in some scenes.  [for video purists]<br /><br />NOTE:  This is a foreign film, so it is subtitled English with spoken Spanish.  I really wasn't a Cruz fan until I saw her perform in this movie.  This film earns my highest recommendation!
B004FOA84A|3.0|I was very impressed with the graphics, but (as with many of the other reviewers) found it much too short.  When my 13 year old daughter finished it in 1 night, I couldn't believe it was over!  I honestly thought I was not doing something right in getting to the \\"next\\" part of the game, only to find out that there IS NO NEXT PART!! Loved it, but it should be MUCH longer!
1118156315|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  It is a simple easy to follow method for step by step analysis of a business process.  This is powerful for an established company, a growing company, a start up and for an individual.  Tim Clark just did an amazing workshop at Portland State University sharing this model.  The workshop was at capacity and all the participants were engaged with the material and impressed with the insights gained in a short period of time with a ONE PAGE model!  Great teaching tool!  Great learning tool! I will be sharing it with my business classes in the future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I checked out the audio book from the library to listen to while in the car.  The problem was, I wanted more!  So I bought the Kindle edition on Amazon and then finished reading the book.  The writing is great.  I felt like I was in the Hunger Games.  Catniss is a great character, she is strong, smart and brave.  She loves her little sister.  The games themselves were very harsh, but not over explicit in violence.  Everyone should read this book.  I cannot wait for the movie to come out!
1592537251|5.0|I have admired the sketches of author Gabriel Campanario ever since they started appearing weekly in The Seattle Times. Known as the Seattle Sketcher, Campanario takes even the most commonly photographed, iconic Seattle scenes, such as the Pike Place Market, and gives them his fresh, personal perspective that no camera can capture. I was so inspired that I became an urban sketcher myself. As I dug for more of his work on his personal blog, I was led to the local and then the international Urban Sketchers blogs (initiated by Campanario), which showed me the world \\"one drawing at a time\\" - and further compelled me to explore my city (and any city I visit) with a sketchbook. Now The Art of Urban Sketching brings to print the same types of visual expressions that I have been admiring online.<br /><br />The 300-plus pages are divided into three parts. The first helps beginning sketchers gather the right tools and attitude to adopt the urban sketchers' manifesto.<br /><br />The second, and largest, section, the meat of the book, compiles the work of more than a hundred artists worldwide giving us their unique urban views. It's nothing short of amazing to see the variety of styles, media and perspectives. Some sketches are casual and loose, while others are intensely detailed. Some are completed in minutes; others in many hours over the course of weeks. All are the result of careful observation and the desire of the artists to truly know a place by sketching it.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the artist profiles, their first-person anecdotes about the scenes they sketched and the photos of those artists sketching (usually standing on a street corner, sitting against a building or on a bench). I also appreciated brief technical tips the artists offered to make outdoor sketching more comfortable or make drawings more interesting, and information about how long the sketch took and media used. Some sites depicted are easily recognizable because they are widely photographed, yet the sketches are more intimate and personal than most photos. Other cities are less-often seen in the media, so these glimpses of faraway neighborhoods seem led by personal tour guides.<br /><br />The third section covers themes - architecture, seasons, nighttime sketching - that urban artists are compelled to sketch. \\"People in Action\\" - my personal favorite sketching subject that I also find most challenging - includes helpful tips on how to capture movement, mood and energy when you only have a few minutes or seconds before the \\"model\\" is gone.<br /><br />As a long-time wannabe sketcher, I have read and admired many books on nature sketching (Hannah Hinchman's fine work comes first to mind), but as a city dweller, I don't often or easily see the breathtaking landscapes and wildlife shown in those books. Finally, a book of sketches for the rest of us that makes it clear that the urban landscape can be as compelling, moving and ever-changing as nature. If you have any desire to capture your urban life in a sketchbook or view how others have captured theirs, you will love this book.et the sketches are more intimate and personal than most photos.

B005PK1G76|5.0|Perfect accessory to hold my wallet, keys, baby's bottle, and a toy! It fit on my city mini perfectly and stores nicely attached to stroller when I fold it. I reccommend it and it is a good value.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|the game itself is boring, repetitive, and a money grab for in-app purchases. Take a close look at all the 5-star ratings and you will notice how they are all the same format and does not even come close to mentioning this games many faults. Even angry birds and where's my water has a larger range of star votes,  yet this game has all 5 stars? Please!

B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I tried to cut glass when I was a kid and could never get the hang of it.  I got this glass cutter today and got a perfect cut on my first try.<br /><br />The trick is to use a light touch.  The instructions warn that too deep a score will not fracture easily.  A glass 'cutter' does not actually cut the glass it just lightly scratches it so it breaks a certain way when you stress it by plunging it into hot and cold water.  There will be a certain amount of failure, even if you do everything right. Glass is tricky. This is not cutting, it is controlled breaking.<br /><br />I found that the hot water method only works for small bottles and bottle necks. I shattered four large bottles trying to get them to separate with the hot and cold water method.  For large bottles I had more success using the tapper that came with the kit.  You need to tap the cut from inside the bottle, tapping on the outside doesn't work.<br /><br />I found the device easy to assemble. (It does require \\"some assembly\\".) The instructions were clear and detailed.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this product.

B000IYU9HW|4.0|Despite the fact that I'm happily married to my high school sweetheart, I usually despise romance stories.  I find most to be over-the-top sugary sweet, gag-worthy and unconvincing.<br /><br />I actually looked this movie up because I love the theme song.  When I was a child, I had a music box that played the song and had always wanted to see the movie from where the song originated.<br /><br />I delayed watching the movie until one day I must have had some some sort of surge of estrogen.  I put on a facial mask, took a bubble bath, applied henna to my hair, painted my nails, and ordered this movie to watch while the henna soaked in my hair.  (I'm an adult former tomboy.  I don't usually do this sort of thing.)<br /><br />My hubby and oldest daughter watched the movie with me.  We all really enjoyed it.  Parts of it were syrupy sweet - but even so, the couple's love for one another was believable.  It seems like so many movie couples are only infatuated with one another, so it was nice to see a couple that was really truly in love.  I didn't find their devotion to one another out of the ordinary.  It wasn't a story where a beautiful woman conned some man into falling for her and then living happily ever after.  They worked hard together and made sacrifices to reach their goals.  Even if the movie didn't end in the way it did, I think that a couple like these characters would have happily reached their 50th wedding anniversary together.  (It's a romance movie though.  I guess it is more interesting for it to have a tear-jerking tragic ending.)<br /><br />It is a 70's movie, so it isn't going to be as flashy as modern movies.  Some of the dialog is corny.  Even so, I think it's worth watching at least once.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|i learned about this boook from my mom. she said she had seen then movie and loved it. she also told me the book version might be hard to find. i went to books a million and they had a ton of the lovely agatha christie's books. they had and then there were none. i read the book and fell in love. the only thing that annoyed me is how years later i cant read it again becuase i still remember who the killer was lol this book in way brought one of my favorite games clue to life. kudos agatha you are STILL CLASSIC AND GREAT WRITING AT ITS BEST.

B005I4JG80|5.0|\\"Once you have children, your life is not your own. They dominate your world.\\" These words still echo through my head. This statement was made by best friend (and I've heard it echoed in various forms from my mother, sister and girlfriends). Is it in our (American) psyches that these little creatures are going to dominate our every waking moment and that we lose sense our concept of self, coming to only identify with the mother role? In Bringing Up Bebe, Pamela Druckerman addresses this topic from the French point of view; which is essentially that it is not healthy for mother or child. This book explores to be fully engaged as parent, you need to have balance to your identity, which re-enforces your child's independence and models self-esteem. This concept is not French; it's a psychological one.<br /><br />Fundamentally I don't think the author states French parenting is best but it might come across that way to some readers. Merely her book is an examination of her experience in France as an expatriate parent trying to navigate parenthood. It is a cultural observation and a bit of personal observation all rolled into one.<br /><br />I've witnessed plenty of over-indulgent parenting. Once my husband addressed my helicopter tendencies when I babysat my nephew. I guess that's why I read this book. Some of the concepts Druckerman presents for discipline and upbringing are not new. However given today's pro-American cultural climate and the context and location in which the author wrote her book, these concepts might be French to some readers. Even as a non-parent, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I highly recommend Bringing Up Bebe, particularly if you are interested in parenting, child-development, cross-cultural topics, or sociology.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|it a fun game I like to play it I can put thing on to cook and go do something and came and ready for me to put the food out

1400069289|4.0|I found this book absolutely fascinating. The drive behind people and society has always intrigued me, but this book went into that and a lot more. It explains the marketing ploys some companies use to get you to come back, how they can find out you might be pregnant by what you buy before you even tell anyone! It also describes the habit of the individual, the corporation and the people who lose their own free will to habits. There is a lot of information here, and it will probably make me look at my shopping experience, my habits and that of others around me a lot differently. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />I won this book in a Goodreads First Reads Giveaway.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Sinead's voice has the power to enchant, to destroy, to uplift and humble.  On \\"how about I be me?\\", she does all of these things.  This is music that it feels like she had to sing.  This is not music for anyone else, although we are welcome to listen to it and love or hate it.  It is music that Sinead sings for herself, and her beliefs and her heart.  I am floored by her visceral power, her fragile timidity, her gentle compassion and her righteous anger.  Simply, she is herself, take her or leave her, naked, defiant and scared.  This album is almost terrifyingly confessionally honest.  An album for the long time fans, yes, but also one that should set the rock firmament on fire.  It's that good.  Thanks, Sinead.  I'm gonna make this part of my cannon, part of my heart, and sing your songs in the dark when I need some strength.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is a fairy tale retelling, the first I have read of this genre, but it did not disappoint. Cinderella as a cyborg? Count me in!<br /><br />The world is set after a supposed World War Four in New Beijing. Everything is different, and not always in the best way. Cinder still has her evil stepmother and stepsisters, but everything else is its own story.<br /><br />I loved Cinder. She was strong and her cyborg qualities intriguing. Prince Kai was charming and I loved reading about her thoughts and emotions concerning him. Also, Iko was quite the fun little android. It made me wish for an android of my very own!<br /><br />The book was a little predictable in once sense, but it didn't ruin anything for me when my predications were confirmed. There were a few things I definitely did not expect and I cannot wait for the next book. I was surprised to learn there would be three more books, and am curious to see how this story pans out.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app! i think that its the only app that has more than one game on it!! AWESOME!!!

B000NTPDSW|5.0|My grandchildren are just now discovering the Godfather movies - a testament to the timelessness of this series. (and scary to realize how old that makes ME!) This Coppola Restoration is absolutely magnificent on my HD Plasma Screen - like watching the movies all over and noticing things I'd never noticed before. An absolute must-have for any BR DVD Collector !
B000NTPDSW|2.0|Ok, I've been watching Godfather I and II for years - one of my favorite movie themes of all time.  I saw the can't beat bargain price of $25 for the Coppola Restoration Bluray Set - great deal.  Unfortunately, the quality of the bluray transfer is not good.  I thought I was watching a VHS version on my big screen LCD TV.  This is just poor...I thought maybe the indoor scenes were grainy because of the low light but the outdoor scenes (Wedding and dancing) are just as bad.  Not sure what happened here but this is not Bluray quality at all.  Disappointing and a bad product.  Wait for a new digitally remastered release I guess.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the first page, I was completely drawn into this book - the characters, the setting, the emotion of a totally different world. This was flawless, seamless, unbelievably pleasurable reading. I'd seen the book advertised, but never thought about downloading it until I saw the trailer for the movie. I am SO happy that I've now read this book prior to seeing the movie.<br /><br />This author knows how to draw in the reader, how to engage, how to make us feel part of the story and feel compelled to read on; becoming completely invested in the characters. So many have gone over the plot, I won't do that here. I will only say that for a very picky reader, this is a Must Read, Can't Put Down, Five-Star book.  Well done, Ms. Collins.

B001LF2WCC|5.0|I had enjoyed the film in the theatre and wanted a copy for my own.  I had read some negative reviews about the original blu-ray copy of the film and I was a little concerned.  Not to worry, The Complete Experience Blu-ray looked sharp and true with excellent sound.  Watching this film with my family, it left all of us impressed with the quality of the Blu-ray disc.  Included is a nice array of extras on the disc, you will learn more about the 300 experience from behind the camera, the cast, and others who contribute to the 300 experience.  The book includes some interesting shots from the film and provides a sturdy protective case for the blu-ray.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|good game. very attractive. nice graphics. music is good and not annoying like most games. looks great on kindle fire. I love puzzle and challenging games that make you think!

B000XR4OC0|4.0|I purchased these shoes in a beautiful chocolate brown from Nordstrom about a month and a half ago. I got them in my true size (6.5) and they fit like a glove initially. Now that I've had time to break them in, they're really loose around the sides and heel. They're still a *GREAT* shoe, but if you plan on wearing these often, size down a half a size. I wore mine pretty much every day for the first 2 weeks, which is when I started to notice they were pretty loose. They're canvas, so they stretch easily.<br /><br />All in all, a great quality shoe that does a good deed when you purchase a pair (the company donates a pair to a needy child). I'm planning on purchasing a few more pairs in different colors and patterns, and I'll be buying them a half size down.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I love this movie SO much. Really, it's the king (and queen) of all Hollywood romance films. For such a seemingly small movie it has more scope than most epics, maybe because of its wonderful script, with lines that are now so iconic in our culture, all as the world was about to sink into the greatest, most tragic war we'd ever known. Everything about the film feels perfect. It's just one of those movies that you can finish and put right back in the DVD player and watch all over again. Sigh... Or maybe to put it another way, \\"Play it again, Sam\\" :-)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is quite entertaining. It has kept me very engaged and occupied for several hours over the last month. It's great for waiting for appointments or anything else, as well as for brain exercises.

B004LWZW88|5.0|This is an amazing animated movie! We had a party 2 weeks ago and there's about 45-50 people (kids and adults) that watched this movie in our \\"BIG\\" screen tv and everybody loved it!!!Absolutely!!! Everybody was quiet during highlights and laughing during those cute moments. At the end of the movie, everybody was clapping and happy about the whole movie experience....so I don't know whats up with this \\"PIPS\\" that has negative reviews....But you know what I only see a few reasons why which is 1)small screen tv...reason why they can't see the incredible details in the movie; 2)inferior home theater system hence very poor sound quality (its such a waste! you guys are losing a lot); 3) lost sense of humor, probably you guys have lost the inner child in you...If you guys didn't fall on those 3 reasons then....there's really something wrong with you...and c'mon, almost 50 people watched this movie with me and ENJOYED it so you can't beat that!!!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Just saw the movie again (on a long plane ride)<br />It is one of my favorites.  Then I remembered that I had purchased the soundtrack twice--4 or 5 yrs ago--(the first one was \\"borrowed\\") and I went looking thru the mess in my car for the other one.  Found it today and drove the long way to work listening to it.<br />I love this version of Songbird, and hearing<br />Joni Mitchell sing Both Sides Now.  Many good songs.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I truly enjoyed this game and feel it was worth the money I spent on it. I had never played a game like this so it took me a bit to get started. Once I got the hang of it, I didn't want to stop.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Jennifer Hudson is a artist that can really sing and make you feel what she is  singing about.  Her vocal on this album is excellent and her lyrics are great. I play this cd so much I know I'm going to scratch it, I'm going to have to buy another 1 soon.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|The sound quality of an iPod/iPhone is not good. If you have ever tried iRiver's Mp3 players, you must agree with me. I have tried many brands of Mp3 players, iRiver ususally has the best overall sound quality;Sony, iAudio and Creative are also good in their specialties. But an iPod never sounds good because it loses so many details and has very week bass. With E6+L3, the sound quality of an iPod increases dramatically, many details are added, and the bass become stronger. Though it is still not a match for iRiver, it certainly sounds much better with E6.
B004SRNH10|3.0|sence i got adobe air i can have most of the games on amizon thanks to adobe air i can do any thing i want
B007H7XJD4|4.0|There's of course no accounting for taste.  The Direction, Cinematography, etc. was all excellent.  If nothing else, the movie is visually worth the price of rental.  I enjoyed it, and unlike a few of the revues I read prior to renting this, don't feel at all like it was a waste of my money.  But, that is my opinion.  At the time I rented this, there seemed to be as many 5 stars as there were 1's, so clearly there is a strong divide between those who enjoyed this movie, and those that didn't.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I put this on my key chain.  I use it to keep my pocket knives sharp.  If you do not let the knife get too dull, this tool will quickly get you back a working edge.

B0050VFRVG|5.0|Think back to the beginning of your middle school years.  For some of us, it was only a few years ago.  For others it... has been a while.  Either way, try to remember the book that everyone was talking about.  Think of the book that was all the rage.  So, the most popular book at the start of your \\"secondary\\" school years was _________________________________________.<br /> Don't remember?  That's okay.  You don't need to remember.  In fact, if you don't remember, you probably weren't that interested in the book.  It obviously did not have significance to you.  But, you need a book that has a new sense of significance to you.  You need a fresh start.  For me, it was this book.<br /><br />The Riordan Revolution<br /><br /> The Lightning Thief, a fictional novel written by Rick Riordan, is the first in five books of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.  The plot distinctly focuses on Percy, a twelve year-old, who just happens to get kicked out of his boarding school, Yancy Academy - not a huge surprise, as it's happened frequently through the past few years.  Percy begins to experience some peculiar things, like the fact that during a field trip, his teacher suddenly turns in to a boy-eating monster.  After enduring more chaotic events, you follow Percy, and his friend Grover, as they travel to Camp Half-Blood, a place for demi-gods (half human/half god).  Percy, to his surprise, is the son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea.  And, as Poseidon's son, he is blamed for stealing Zeus's master lightning bolt.  The book takes the reader through the ten days that Percy and his friends must survive while trying to retrieve the Master Bolt.  Through twists and turns, Riordan's novel captivates the mind by taking the common Greek mythology and transposing it into a modern-day masterpiece that is a delight to read.  Not only do you enjoy the story, but you live it through a world of imagination.  Out of all of the books that I have read, this one has been a personalfavorite, never ceasing to delight me as I re-read it.  And, I believe The Lightning Thief will enchant any reader for it has an innovative plot, one-of-a-kind characters, and a message that relates to readers of all ages.<br /> Percy's story is one of the most unique stories that one will ever read, and I mean this very literally because it is so unusually wonderful.  Like I stated before, Riordan revolves his plot around Greek mythology, a topic loosely discussed.  We've all heard about the Minotaur and Zeus, but never really learned fully about either one (unless you are a mythologist).  The Lightning Thief demonstrates the genius of Riordan and his ability to condense this subject into a book.  On top of that, he creates an atmosphere that lets the reader know that they are thumbing through his words in his book.  Look at this quote: \\"He helped me hold my glass and put the straw to my lips.  I recoiled at the taste, because I was expecting apple juice.  It wasn't that at all.  It was chocolate-chip cookies.  Liquid cookies.  And not just any cookies - my mom's homemade blue chocolate-chip cookies, buttery and hot, with the chips still melting.  Drinking it, my whole body felt warm and good, full of energy,\\" (60).  Percy surprises the reader here because he describes his \\"liquid cookies\\" in a lovely way, so that one might want to try this drink.  When I first read this quote, I asked myself, How does someone come up with something like that?  Well, apparently, Riordan does, and he continuously demonstrates this characteristic of the story.  Riordan's skill, which is right in front of your eyes, speaks through each individual character.<br /> I'll admit that I'm waiting for that day when I find out that one of the Percy Jackson characters are, in fact, real.  And, furthermore, I'll say that I want to meet two in particular: Percy and his friend from Camp Half-Blood, Annabeth.  These two characters make the story and mold it into much more than a plain old book.  As a reader, one gets to see two sides of the story, even though Percy narrates the book.  Let me start off with Percy.  Oh, Percy.  A favorite for sure.  Not just because he's the main character, but because of his personality.  \\"Grover looked down at the naiads. `Mr.D suspended judgment.  He said... If you got a quest... maybe he'd consider the job complete.  My spirits lifted. `Well, that's not so bad, right?'\\" (112).  Percy is a genuine friend to Grover here who is obviously hurting, for he had disappointed himself about inadequately working on a job.  These days, readers don't see very many characters like Percy.  Percy is a loyal friend but also a fearless fighter, a clever leader, and a tenderhearted kid.  Riordan makes these traits refreshing, like unwrapping a brand new gift.  You haven't used (or read) it before, but you know it's going to be good.  Then we have Annabeth, who is a joy to read about.  This quote comes shortly after Annabeth nursed Percy back to health from a Minotaur attack. \\"She glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me.  I imagined she was going to say, You killed a Minotaur! or Wow, you're so awesome! or something like that.  Instead she said, `You drool when you sleep',\\" (64).  This quote embodies who Annabeth truly is.  A girl who says what she feels, is only impressed when it is completely necessary, and is tough.  All this is what Annabeth does throughout the story.  The same routine, only slightly different each time, telling the reader that she does not mess around.  Other than these two characters, one reads about the gods in a modern style; Poseidon, for example, wears Bermuda shorts and a Hawaiian top - not the typical outfit for a Greek god - which is what one might wear today to the beach. This type of writing keeps a flow between characters, creating a realistic sense in the story.<br /> One thing is for sure: Riordan did not write this book just for the amusement of his readers.  He wrote this book with a message.  A message that I believe any reader can empathize with.  In the beginning of this plot, Percy feels like he doesn't fit in, which is perfectly normal, considering the fact that he has ADHD and dyslexia.  This feeling is made even worse when his teacher confronts him about his expulsion.  \\" `Percy,' he said.  `Don't be discouraged about leaving Yancy.  It's... for the best.'  His tone was kind, but the words still embarrassed me... My eyes stung.  Here was my favorite teacher, in front of the class, telling me I couldn't handle it.  After saying he believed in me all year... `What I'm trying to say...you're not normal, Percy.  That's nothing to be-'<br /> `Thanks,' I blurted.  `Thanks a lot, sir, for reminding me,'\\"(22).<br />That last line is indented for a reason.  There is no doubt that all of us, young or old, have felt what Percy did in that line.  Wanting to fit in is normal, healthy, actually, but it doesn't always seem to happen.  What Riordan does throughout The Lightning Thief is remind the reader that it's okay to feel different.  However, he sends a hidden meaning that it is not okay to hold on to that feeling.  Percy starts to learn, through this book and later on in the series, that to be unlike anyone is to be amazing.  He finds that he does have traits that make him who he is, and begins to embrace that.  And later in the story, his father, Poseidon, tells him this: \\" `You did well, Perseus.  Do not misunderstand me.  Whatever else you do, know that you are mine.  You are a true son of the Sea God,'\\"(346).  Percy is elated with this news.  His father is proud of him and that is not something you hear every day from a Greek god.  What Percy accomplished (I won't tell you what to prevent spoilers) made his father have a new sense of respect that was thoroughly earned.  Percy accepted himself, especially after this comment, and that is a lesson that all readers should learn.<br /> The School Library Journal called The Lightning Thief \\"an adventurequest with hip edge.\\"  Others say that the \\"book really shines,\\" (The Horn Book).  In reality, this book is more that a story.  It's a tale of heroism, a fight for justice, and a quest towards self-acceptance.  The plot is fresh, the characters are oh-so unique, and the message is incredibly relevant.  What's not to love?<br /> Riordan is a new type of author, one that raises the bar for new and upcoming novelists.  Well, let me rephrase the \\"new\\" to beloved.  Everywhere, you see people reading his books (he has created two other popular series).  It is almost unheard of when a middle-schooler says that they have not read his books.  In fact, today, someone saw the book in my hand and asked, \\"You haven't read it yet?\\"  I looked up at them, amused.  \\"Of course I have!\\" I replied.  And we started a whole conversation about Riordan's works.<br /> The point is, no matter who you are or what you do, reading The Lightning Thief is a must.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll go on to read the other books in the series.  Be prepared for some despair when you finish, though.  Percy and his friends will steal your heart and keep you compelled to move on to the next book.  But, do not fear.  I have a feeling that Riordan has a lot more up his sleeve.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|I was very glad when I found out that Capitol was releasing this box set. It is well done and amazing to listen to. I had purchased the Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE from 2004 and I enjoyed hearing this lost classic. I really wanted to hear it from the Beach Boys back in '66. The '66 version is much better in my opinion and Brian Wilson's voice is just plain better in the high falsetto range. The best song on the album is hands down \\"Surfs Up\\". I had heard different versions of this gem, but not the track from this album. It's amazing!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome!!!! game, but it does tend to freeze on ads. i like the fact that it has a ton of old school games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What can I say about this book? The first thing that comes to mind is WOW! this is an amazing book. I have been wanting to read this book for awhile now and all I can say is that it definitely lives up to the hype. I was hooked from the first page. The author does a beautiful job of laying out the imagery of the story and you can't help but feel emotionally attached from the start.<br /><br />The story of the world of Panem is heart wrenching. How awful to live in a world where your every word and move is under constant scrutiny, where the rulers live in luxury while the rest struggle to just survive. The Capitol is a disgusting reminder of what a government with too much power is capable of doing. The Hunger Games is an even more frightening thought. It was hard not to become emotionally attached to the characters, especially when you know only one can come out alive.<br /><br />The characters in this story are amazing. It is hard not to like them all mostly due to the fact that it isn't their fault that they are in the games. I would say my favorite was Katniss. She is hardcore and I found her easy to relate to. Peeta is sweet and smart. The emotional connection that develops between them is evident from the start and plays out beautifully.<br /><br />There are many twists in this story which keep the pages turning quickly. Just when you think everything is okay, here comes something else. It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. I loved this book and am anxious to finish the rest of the series. Every page keeps you wanting more and more.

0307352145|1.0|Deeply disappointed. I thought I would be reading about introversion as it relates to people who are introverts. Instead the book turned out to be a History lesson on other famous introverts. The book did not help me understand or feel good about being an introvert. I also felt the book had some biased leanings towards the progressive movement, ie. stating that the website Moveon.org was a wonderful website. Sorry but she missed the mark on making this book about introverts and instead made the book about famous introverts. Boring.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Just a great movie, with an interesting concept.  I saw this in theaters and had to have it, and it was a great purchase on blu ray plus DVD combo.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|1975 was a very long time ago. So, with that little slice of obviousness behind us, what exactly is Bruce Springsteen up to on the other side of the looking-glass as I consider the significance of his much anticipated new album Wrecking Ball. Springsteen has never had it easy managing expectations - even before listening for the first time, I am already half-smiling at the consternation and intellectual discomfort of many reviewers as they ponder the delphic riddle that confounds them with every new Springsteen release - whether or not his new music returns New Jersey's favorite son to the working class zen so powerfully forged during his first decade of work.<br /><br />Respectfully, with nearly forty years now seperating Wrecking Ball from the work that made his reputation, a side-by-side comparison seems unfair and absurdly front-loaded. The music that Springsteen created between 1973 and 1982 is now really for the ages and represents a nearly impossible standard for any artist to live up to.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Springsteen, once his own PR flaks started cranking out the agitprop touting his imminent release as the time-machine return of the \\"old Bruce\\" and \\"the best\\" since Born To Run, The River or... (fill in the blanks) it seemed inevitable that Wrecking Ball would, could never overcome the weight of their very wishful but ultimately, weightless hyperbole. To be fair, there's really no objective assessment worth a damn that can be made for music that we have been listening to for mere hours against songs that has been seminal to the rock soundtrack for almost four decades.<br /><br />All of that aside, my first impressions of Wrecking Ball are strong - Bruce's vocals are solid, he's pissed and still seems to be experimenting - all critical since the most moving and important rock music has never been born from politenesss and complacency.<br /><br />Are the lyrics as inspired as those that I can recite in my sleep? Who knows. Although they seem a bitbasic, lacking the cinematic grandeur of some of his best storylines, they are written in a time when complete thoughts are now compressed into tweets and texts - brain cramps shoehorned into 140 character scribbles that are long on immediacy and short on imagination. Regardless, given Springsteen's current mood their lack of subtlety seems to work. In any case, Springsteen's songwriting is exponentially better on this record than the ridiculousness he mailed-in for Working On A Dream.<br /><br />Maybe given the time to breath over the next few months the natural, evolving familiarity of the record will work to enhance my already growing appreciation for the gut-level, populist furies that Springsteen has unleashed (who knew that Rumson NJ's .001% occupiers were so damn angry.) At the very least New Jersey's Governor Chris \\"Wrecking Ball\\" Christie (so dubbed by his critics at the Newark Star Ledger) is still smiling at the back-handed, naming-rights compliment from his hero.<br /><br />For better or worse, Wrecking Ball is an exceptional 2012 rock record (and easily his best 21st century release) crafted by an artist who still seems inspired by his music and his message. We should all be so lucky.
0142428280|4.0|I can't disagree with the reviewers that complain that the author stretched a bit to work in all the interactions.  (The reference to Forest Gump is a bit overstating it, but a very clever remark).  I think he does a pretty good job fairly communicating the complex political and social situation as it led up to World War I and its aftermath.  This book certainly beats the many boring academic tomes on the subject.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book version, which was expertly read handling the many national and regional dialects very well.<br /><br />The only real complaint about the writing is that there are several places where he uses the exact same phrase in a manner that jumps out at you making you ask, \\"was the editor asleep at the wheel?\\".  Other than that, I really enjoyed the book and look forward to either reading or listening to the next in the series.

159514188X|5.0|This book was pretty amazing! It was about a boy, Clay, who receives these tapes from the girl who killed herself. No one really knew why she did it, but throughout those tapes, and tracing her life for a few weeks you get to learn the big secret of how and most interestingly why? What I enjoyed most about this novel is the plot, it was really intriguing, and made me want to keep reading to find out what would happen next. Also the way that the story was set up was great, it was like two different things, reality and then the other world with the tapes. The theme of the book was also very compelling, because this is such an controversial topic you don't see many book written about it, but this one, to me, described the situation perfectly,and what could be so bad that will make a person want to end their own life. Overall I really enjoyed this book and would tell anyone to read it!

Andwhy did they go on vacation when the needed counseling for their son.<br /><br />I wont be recommending this book, it was just ok.

B005NQ94LM|1.0|For all of you Anne Hathaway fans ... NO, DO NOT WATCH THIS.<br /><br />Saying its boring is a compliment.  Its safe to say it starts out boring then it gets worse. After it gets worse then everything goes down hill.<br /><br />One main character is boring, drab and bland. The other main character is horny, drunk and rude for 99% of the movie.<br /><br />I didnt feel or see any romance (not even a crumb of  romance).  She wants love, but he is a sad excuse for a man. Its a relationship movie or a long public announcement on what women<br />should not do with a relationship (and the type of guy to avoid).<br /><br />Also, Amazon needs a rating that is NO STARS. I don't want to give anybody any hope. This review is straight from a positive person that was blind-sided by misleading advertisements.

0609610570|4.0|A very informative book that gets into the heart of implementing a strategic plan. Larry and Ram put the onus on the leader to keep everyone & everything on track.<br /><br />Many good insights in this book, such as \\"To understand execution you have to keep 3 key points in mind: 1) Execution is a discipline and integral to strategy. 2)Execution is the major job of the business leader. 3) Execution must be a core element of an organization's....Tactices are central to execution, but execution is not tactics. Execution is fundamental to strategy and has to shape it. No worthwhile strategy can be planned without taking into account the organization's ability to execute it...Execution is a systematic process of rigorously discussing hows and whats, questioning, tenaciously following through, and ensuring accountability.\\"<br /><br />Larry uses many examples of his experience at Honeywell to serve as illustrations of execution, but they can be distractions and detours. Otherwise, I'd give this book 5 stars.
0061452068|5.0|Tired of hearing of the evil in the world? The crisis on every corner? How we are all doomed? Me too, so I went on a news diet. However Ridley's book, Rational Optimist, reminds us that we are doing just fine.<br /><br />  We seemingly never hear the good things: we produce more food on less land, we save more lives than ever before, we have an ever increasing life expectancy, innovation is happening at an unprecedented rate, technology saves more lives, literacy is up, education increases, crime in general is down, and we are developing a social conscience. As a species, we want to do good for others! According to Ridley, if bureaucrats, tyrants and zealots stay out of the way we can give peace a chance. The future will keep getting better and better.<br /><br />My farmer ancestors never had it so good: running water, instant heat, power from the earth instead of slave labor, fast travel, access to education, choices for women, the chance to become what we would like to become...and the ability to produce almost anything we can dream up...and we are great dreamers!<br /><br />Ridley claims that all the nay-sayers in the past few hundred years are wrong. The sky is not falling, did not fall and things get/got better. If you are looking for a silver lining, a reason to believe in the human race, to believe that progress makes our lives better and many reasons to be done with the doom and gloom--this book will provide those reasons. We can improve things without wallowing, without fears, prejudices and extremist bias holding us back - our history (and current lifestyle) proves we did and do! We see a problem and we do something about it.<br /><br />Every book has its downsides, and there are a few spots where the research and the conclusions/advice could be better. Ridley reminds us, that there are millions of people, who everyday work at making the world a better place.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Bruce is back, and he has something important to say. Now, before I start on the actual album I want to refer to his past two albums. Magic and Working On A Dream, I enjoyed them for what they were (Magic more than WOAD) but for me, the mixing and producing really ruined those albums. Plus, WOAD lacked real memorable songs, I did kind of enjoy Outlaw Pete though (Sorry!)<br /><br />Anyway, Bruce has given us new music. Is it the same goosebump inducing rock excellance as Born to Run? Uh, no. What the unforgetable stories of Darkness On the Edge of Town? Nope, not that either. What we have here is Bruce writing real songs, conveying real emotions, topics that real people can relate to. Lyrically, I find it (while a little blunt) refreshing, songs like Jack of All Trades, Death to my Hometown, and This Depression all have deep meanings behind them and (for me) the emotion is tangible, as opposed to some of the trite lyrics of WOAD.<br /><br />But what about the MUSIC? Well, is it revolutionary? No, not at all. Is it gonna rock your socks off? Eh, maybe a few songs (Wrecking Ball, We Take Care of Our Own, and American Land thump) But,I did find this album diverse enough, whether its the Irish strings,the slow acoustic guitar in You've Got It, or the generated drum beat of Death to my Hometown, it all sounds good to me. AND Tom Morello's presence is appreciated, his solo in Jack Of All Trades is fantastic.<br /><br />In closing, this is a strong album, does it belong in the legendary shelf? No, but that doesn't mean the music can't speak to you. Sure it has sad/angry undertones, sure some songs sound like Flogging Molly, but I have to admit, the album isn't boring. Good for Bruce, going strong at 62.<br /><br />Till Next Time

1594203334|5.0|This book is a must for anyone involved with children.  I have always believed that we Americans cater to and push our children too much.

B002ZG97LK|2.0|I rarely review movies because they are so subjective to each person's individual likes/dislikes, but this was just awful. The acting was terrible, Dennis Quaid looked embarassed to even be in the movie in his scenes. I had to restrain myself from fastforwarding this within the first 15mins and I kept hoping it would get better ... it didn't. It may be worth $1 for the rental for some, but man am I glad I actually got this rental for free because personally - I'd want my $1 back. As it is I already want my 1hr 50mins minutes back. It was so obvious it was an Mtv production - this should've aired on Mtv or gone straight to DVD. And the \\"actors\\" in it should go back to their dancing day jobs.<br /><br />The only reason this movie ever made it into the theaters is because it was a remake of a cult classic. A lame, insulting remake at that. The dancing in the original may have not been as cool cuz it was 80's style, but at least they were great actors and the soundtrack was good too.

I went and read all the books as well and they are just as amazing. I love the story line and I love almost all the characters because, not only are they deep and so well developed, but no character is purely \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". I can't wait for season 2!

B0025UHKNS|1.0|When I can get it to work the 405CX is amazing. As I am riding my bike it tells me my speed and changes in elevation.  When I get home it automatically connects to my pc and tells me all kinds of info - average speed, calories, distantce, maps, graphs wonderful.  The problem is the touch interface. It can take me 5 minutes or more to turn the GPS function on or off. It can get lost in its menus.  My son who is an engineering student who builds PC's and fixes motorcycles for fun in his spare time took it on a ski trip so he could record his maximum speed and how many runs he made gave up in frustration because he never could get it to work.  Garmin should redesign the 405cx putting a couple more buttons on it and get rid of the tap interface.
B006LEHOL2|4.0|She's still got that fantastic voice and the lyrics that make my ears do a double take, proving the difference between some tired record company's idea of a \\"marketable\\" female singer and a genuine artist. This album opens with a great track, has no filler whatsoever, and ends with a spellbinding stick of dynamite called \\"V.I.P\\". People get so bent out of shape when she speaks her mind, but that's exactly what I love about her! This is a great album that keeps surprising me the more I listen to it. Don't miss it.

B004ZN9R6G|5.0|After recently buying this fantastic remaster of my favourite Pink Floyd album, I'm listening to it right now as I type takes me back to the excitement of buying my very first Floyd album in 1972. Obscured By Clouds was that album, though was not my first introduction an already mighty band. My indoctrination to Pink Floyd came via my mate Steve a few months earlier when he played A Saucer Full Of Secrets, Umma Gumma and the soundtrack More one stormy night after the pub. It<br />was life changing! I've been Floydian ever since.<br />James Guthrie and Joel Plante have done a superb job on this great album, there is so much more to listen to now imo. Now there is crisp clean music to lose yourself in (all over again for me). I'm really glad I waited until recently before I began ordering Pink Floyd's back catalogue. Each new James Guthrie album remaster I listen to is magic to my ears.<br />I find this era (1968-1972) of Floyd to be more interesting to listen to than work from say Dark Side on, certainly more experimental and extreme. It's a forty year loop that I'm happy to be on, renewing my listening pleasure with a classic Floyd album (and yes, it will always be an album). The packaging on these remasters is generally good with the exception of NOT having plastic sleeves for the cds. How can the Japanese have sleeves and not the rest of the world?<br /><br />This is a highly recommended album, and as good as anything that followed it.
1449305172|5.0|We use Running Lean as one of the books for 1 Semester Startup ([..]), a course at the University of Texas at Austin that brings mentorship to student-founded startups. We're staunch supporters of domain knowledge and hands-on experience over theory. Our course doesn't rely on textbooks in general. There's so much valuable insight contained here, though, that it would crazy not to take advantage.

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|If you collect anime and you haven't got this one yet, do yourself a favor and GRAB THIS. There hasn't been anything with such high production such as this in years. MadHouse does it again. I've already watched it 3 times and I just got it a week ago. You really want to root for the racers, the cars are stunningly designed and the animation...WHOO!! The uptempo pounding Techno soundtrack really fits too.<br />What a ride this one is. GET IT!!!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS! When I first saw the Trailer for this movie I thought it would truly suck or would be a amazing movie, I didn't think there would be any middle ground. This movie was amazing.<br /><br />I am a Star Trek fan, by no means am I what people call a Trekkie. I will never play dress up for any show or movie outside of Halloween. I Still have some semblance of a life. Still I am a big Star Trek fan. I've seen about half the episodes of the original series, all the movies, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, about half the Voyager and Enterprise. I was sadly disappointed with the last few Trek films, they were huge disappointments. So I was hoping this would be a good film and I was right.<br /><br />1. Story: The story was pretty good. Time travel plots and become convoluted, but J.J. Abrams and the writers did a wonderful job of keeping everything together. I like how the created a alternate time line so they can create their own Trek universe for the sequels guaranteed to come. The only flaw was the bad guy Nero/Eric Bana. I don't know he just didn't seem to fit in.<br /><br />2. Characters/Actors: This was perhaps the best part of the film. J.J. Abrams and the writers again brought new life to these classic characters. Chirs Pine/James T Kirk did a amazing job, and I really did think that would be the young kirk. Zachary Quinto/Spock was great. I like how he brought Spock to life and took him in another direction than I thought they would go. Karl Urban/Leonard McCoy did a really good job. Unlike the actors above I've seen a few of Urban's films and he's a good actor. Leonard Nimoy/Spock what else can you say but fantastic. When I first heard he was going to be in the film I thought it would be for a few seconds, but he has a major role. Nimoy is as good as ever as Spock. When I think about it this movie really was about Spock and his life. Eric Bana/Nero was the only bad one in this film. I really like him as a actor but this film wasn't right for him or maybe it was how the character was written. All the other actors from Bruce Greenwood, Winona Ryder to Ben Cross did really good jobs.<br /><br />3. Special Effects: Done by ILM were just stunning, and some moments will leave you breathless.<br /><br />4. Music: The score by Michael Giacchino was riveting.<br /><br />5. Directing: I was really surprised J.J. Abrams did a great job.<br /><br />Overall: A really great film and the third best Trek film. Behind Star Trek II: The Wraith on Khan and Star Trek IV: The Undiscovered Country. Now I can't wait for a new Trek film.
B006RXSBS2|5.0|It's unlikely that you would not enjoy this movie! It is full of action and the story is one of a kind.
B002ZE85YW|2.0|WARNING SPOILERS!!! What was the point of the movie? That's the question I kept asking myself after the movie. What was the point of the movie besides making money and gearing up for the obvious sequel a few years down the road.<br /><br />Terminator Salvation in my opinion is by far the worst terminator movie mainly because there is no point to the movie. No big secrets are revealed nothing new was done that hasn't been done before and better, and the story went no where except to make money and to get ready for more movies down the road.<br /><br />The only actors that had any impact were Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood. They were the only two that felt alive during this movie. Christian Bale did a terrible job, and he's a good actor two. Which reflects badly on the director McG. After all he did direct the two bad Charlie's Angles movies.<br /><br />The only real good thing about this movie were the special effects, but if that's the best thing you can say about a movie that isn't animated than that's not saying much.<br /><br />Overall: A real disappointment, just skip it and wait for it to come out on DVD and rent it.

0312641893|5.0|Wow! I can't remember the last time I was so forget-to-breath enthralled by a book. Cinder is based on the Cinderella fairy tale, but in this case she's a tough but lonely cyborg in a post-WWIV world that believes people with a few machine parts are less than human, fit only to be property or slaves.  There's the requisite mean stepmother and stepsister, but Cinder is devoted to her second stepsister, and instead of Disney animals as her friends she's got a loyal but loopy android.<br /><br />After the devastation of the last war the world was divided into six large allied kingdoms, and in this vulnerable but brave new world Cinder works as a mechanic in a New Beijing market booth, though everything she earns is legally her stepmother's. Cinder meets the prince when he comes by her booth with an android that needs fixing, but that's the least of his problems. The powerful Queen of the strange Earth colony on the moon is threatening war, a devastating plague is racing through the country, and the prince's own father, the emperor, is dying.<br /><br />Cinder is an actual strong heroine, someone who might save the prince rather than the other way around, but she sees herself as unimportant and even repellant based on the way she's treated.  Her mechanical body parts don't fit well and keep falling off, but they still give her amazing abilities she doesn't yet completely appreciate.  Since it's inspired by the fairy tale you kind of know where the story is going, there's a ball for instance, but author Marissa Meyer throws in numerous heart-palpitating twists and complications, so that while Cinder is fittingly and spectacularly stunning at the ball it's not in any traditional fairy tale way.<br /><br />This is the first of a series so some things are wrapped up by the end of the book but the story, fortunately, is by no means over.
B0052U59F4|4.0|I loved this series! I was caught up in the writing from the start. I could easily imagine Christian, and smell him and the words totally brought me there! I had a bit more challenging time picturing Ana but perhaps that's because the writer was writing as Ana? In any event, these books drove me crazy and I love them! That said, I want to share my concerns about portraying a dominant (or submissive) as someone who is \\"broken\\" and damaged. While I get that this is the story line for this book, there are many, many dominants and submissives who are quite healthy mentally and just enjoy the power exchange. I worry that most main stream portrayals of people in that lifestyle consistently show them as people who need \\"help.\\" Of course there are abused people who fall in to that lifestyle but the majority are simply normal people who like role play and power exchange.<br />Again, love the books, loved what they did to me!

B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Tony Bennett is an American classic. His collaborations are touching, soulful, and done with taste and refinement. He has his duet partners record in a room with a band without headphones. How many modern artists record in this pure way? It's a revelation to see someone who was there at the inception of the record industry, keeping it honest today.
B000ERU9S2|5.0|Ever since I first saw this movie I've never tired of seeing it again. Robert De Niro plays one of his best roles as the calm, cool, collective former American intelligence operative who's hired to assist in the retrieval of a case - contents unknown - for which the client is willing to pay quite handsomely. The title of the movie \\"Ro­nin\\" was the name given to a Samurai Warrior during the Feudal Period of Japan (1185 - 1868), who became master-less as a result of either the loss of his master's favor, or his master's death. In this case, the word defines a group of special ops soldiers who no longer operate under the leadership of one's country, and are instead internationally hiring out their services as independents. This movie includes one of the best car chase scenes that you will see described in detail in the \\"Extras\\". Well worth the price and it'll keep you on the edge of you seat.

B004XISI4A|5.0|I found this series absolutely captivating. The depth of the characters really connects you to them and their trials and tribulations on a meaningful level. When the series came to an end, I was bereft - left wanting to know more.<br /><br />It might fall under the genre of epic fantasy but the very nature of mankind is explored in a very realistic way - Politics, war, love. Not much about that stuff has changed and you find yourself relating it to current times. If you like this genre, you won't be able to put it down!

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|There hadn't been a war on earth since World War IV, over 100 years ago.  But that could all change at the drop of a hat, or the death of the current Emperor actually. The Lunar Queen, from planet Luna, has been threatening war unless the Earthen societies sign a peace treaty with her, which includes the marriage to one of the leaders; namely Prince Kai.<br /><br />Cinder is a teenage Cyborg living in the futuristic commonwealth of New Beijing.  She is treated as a slave by her stepmother, forced to work in the square, fix and clean at Adri's whims, and endure the implications that Cinder is nothing but a second-class citizen; unworthy of anyone's attention.  But...she has caught the eye of Prince Kai.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for this book to be released from the first time I'd heard about it---and I'm not usually into robots, cyborgs, or futuristic anything.  I was NOT disappointed at any point in this book...of course, this was only because I knew there would be more books in the series...had I not known that, I would have had serious issues with the lack of a proper ending.<br /><br />This book is a clever retelling of the classic Cinderella story.  I loved listening to this book from the beginning. I felt every emotion that passed through Cinder from love to anger, to shyness, to disgrace and discomfort.  Each character, whether they were human, cyborg, android, good, or evil, played their parts very, very well.  I was able to connect with them all on one level or another, although the Lunar Queen gave me the willies but I guess that's a connection of sorts, isn't it?!<br /><br />Cinder is an excellently written heroine.  She has depth, strength, and good moral fiber.  She may not be able to cry, but contrary to popular opinion, Cinder has emotions and feels sadness, despair, and joy.  Despite the disfunctional home she lives in, Cinder is well-grounded and very smart.<br /><br />Prince Kai is a fantastic hero.  He must keep things together through the threats of invasion and deal with a deadly disease that has no known cure (although an antidote becomes known but is a stick situation).  He stumbles upon Cinder in the square. Thinking Lin Cinder, the greatest mechanic, is an older man (due to reputation and word of mouth ads), Kai brings his android, Nancy, to be repaired.  Boy is he shocked at the sight of a pretty girl sitting in the booth.<br /><br />Dr. Erland at the clinic is a great supporting character for Cinder.  He treats her with respect and provides her with information and items that will eventually change what everyone thinks about her.....To be continued in the next book...I hope.<br /><br />Overall, this book is fantastic and I'm so glad I \\"read\\" it as I drove to work and back everyday.  The narration was spot on and gave the entire book a totally different overtone than if I would have read it with my eyes.  Her voice work with each character was excellent.<br /><br />(Audiobook provided at no cost in exchange for an honest review)s of invasion and deal with a deadly disease that has no known cure (although an antidote becomes known but is a stick situation).

B0052U59F4|5.0|I ordered this book because someone on some TV show was commenting on it. I bought the first book and I could not put it down. I bought the 3 books in 4 days. This is a love story between a financially successful but seriously damaged man and a naive college student who is just about to graduate. They meet and there is an instant attraction but she thought he was way out of her league but he sought her out. He is not what she expected him to be. She falls in love with someone with issues and is very flawed but he is also kind and generous, possessive and protected. He has a dark side.<br /><br /> This book has erotica but I did not feel that it was the main idea of the book but part of the love story. This book is sometimes, sad, amusing and sometimes it simply amazes you. The character, Christian is multifaceted to say the least and you know that there has to be a reason why he is the way he is. His story slowly unfolds through the 3 books.[[ASIN:B0052U59F4 Fifty Shades of Grey]][[ASIN:B005N0PJJO Fifty Shades Darker]][[ASIN:B006ZBRMOU Fifty Shades Freed (Fifty Shades Trilogy)]] You will not fully understand him until you have read all three books. The trilogy is just one long book.Ana is conflicted throughout most of the book. I have read reviews where people did not like her I disagree with them. I liked her. I thought she was strong but sometimes she could not figure out what she really wanted from Christian.<br /><br />The Fifty Shades Trilogy might not be for everyone. There is some BDSM but it is essential to the story. I think the books were well written and the characters were well written. i have not been this excited about a book since I ordered The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest from Amazon UK before it was published in the US.[[ASIN:0307454568 The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (Vintage)]]

It had not substance, no character development, no real plot, just SEX.  I could not finish this book. It angered me to think that a supposedly smart, college educated woman would subject herself to such treatment.  To basically become a sex slave to some man with nasty fetishes.  And honestly, if I had to read inner goddess one more time I think I might vomit.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|First off, this works wonderfully with my Windows 7 (64bit Home) laptop.  Having read another review that this unit didn't work with Windows 7 I was a little cautious, but it works great.<br /><br />Installation was as easy as installing the software from the cd and pluggin the unit into the USB port.  Ableton Live Lite that in included offers an easy setup lesson that walks you through everything you need to get the unit working with that DAW.<br /><br />I've played my P-Bass and Drum Machine through the unit and it all sounds wonderful.  Clean, clear, no pops, no buzzing (other than passive bass buzz, lol) and even though there is a switch for \\"Direct Monitor\\" I found in unnessesary as there was no noticable delay when recording and using filters via the provided Ableton software.  I'm actually really impressed with the software provided, even if it is a \\"LITE\\" version.  It's been fun learning how to use it.<br /><br />I would recommend this unit for any one wanting a small 2 input unit that's great for bedroom or portable applications.  The unit is small and fits easily into my laptop bag and since it is powered via USB you don't have to worry about extra power cables.<br /><br />5 Stars for a great product!!

0756655307|3.0|If you want all the quick info you could handle about Marvel super-heroes and villains...then this is the book for you! If you want to catch up on all things in the Marvel Universe because you have been away for a few years...then this is the book for you! If you are just starting out on reading Marvel Comics and want to know more...then get this book! It's full of vast knowledge on every key player in the Marvel Universe! It details their first appearance and quick rundown of their history! It even focuses on all your favorite teams and events! From past to present! However.....<br /><br />If you own the first edition of 'The Marvel Encyclopedia'....DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK! Don't get me wrong, for first time buyers...this is a fantastic book!!! I recommend it for all super hero & villain lovers!!!! This is a must have in your comic book kingdom!<br /><br />I own the first incarnation of the 'Marvel Encyclopedia' and really like that book. When I saw there was an 'UPDATED & EXPANDED' edition out...I had to have it! To my misfortune, it is THE EXACT SAME BOOK! The publisher's are just milking your wallet! Now, hear me out on this...<br /><br />First: If you have the first one, save your money! It uses the EXACT same illustrations and descriptions as the first. They didn't even attempt to update the artwork. Pathetic really.<br /><br />Second: If you have the first one, save your money! The only thing they really added was more pages to catalog the \\"Big Events\\" in the Marvel Universe in the past couple of years. Including the 'Civil War', 'Secret Invasion' and such. The ONLY place you'll find newer artwork.<br /><br />Third (...and final): If you have the first one, save your money! It's really....REALLY....not worth paying for the same book twice. They added a few characters, removed characters to make space for the new ones, and the cover art is worse than the first.<br /><br />I'm really not that much of a critic or super nerd whining about this. It's just a waste of money if you already have the original. If it wasn't for my three boys that will get use out of this while growing up, I'd have returned it. This could have been a LOT better, instead, it felt like a re-hashed afterthought of a book. Just disappointed.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Harris did not convince me.  I give him props for quoting Dennett at length, allowing the opposing argument to be reasonably expounded, and not grabbing snippets for rhetorical effect.  Still, his argument comes down to an argument from ignorance:  We don't understand it, we can't figure out where it comes from, so it must not exist.  The same arguments could be used for Life herself; the line between life and not-life becomes fuzzier and fuzzier as the organisms get simpler.  Ultimately \\"alive\\" is a human label, not a true fact of nature; and yet, in most cases, most of the time it is a useful and easy to agree upon distinction.  In \\"Freedom Evolves\\", Dennett uses the example of twilight.  It is impossible to determine exactly when twilight ends and night begins; and yet, are we going to argue that there is, therefore, no 'night'?<br /><br />Harris puts quite a bit of weight on experiments that show 'decision' being neurally complete prior to conscious awareness of 'decision'.  My personal response, when I read of these experiments, was identical to that of the compatibilists, as Harris calls them:  it's still 'my' brain, so it's still 'me' deciding.  I find the change of locus interesting but decidedly not earth shaking.  Harris, on the other hand, equates accepting unconscious decision making as 'me' with taking credit for say, endocrine production.  Well, a case is being made (by Damasio, among others) that looking only at the brain is too limited - but it's also quite irrelevant.  Including unconscious brain function in 'me' is not any kind of a leap; free willers and not freewillers alike locate the discussion in the brain, and its borders are an unambiguous frame to the topic.<br /><br />Ultimately I find little difference between the concept of consciousness and free will.  We all agree that somehow consciousness arises, although we haven't a clue where the line between conscious and not conscious lies; we haven't moved a millimeter past Turing.  I hold that\\"Free Will\\" exists because it is a useful concept, and because it's something I experience, and because it makes sense of volition.  My particular take on \\"Freedom Evolves\\" is that my dog and cat have volition - but I have more volition; Jeremy volition minus Merlin volition = Jeremy's free will.

B006OAB3ME|2.0|So, Sir Paul has decided to join the multitude of other aging \\"rockers\\" who have jumped head-first into the \\"great American songbook\\"  to gather some quick, easy sales from his fading fans.  I was actually taken aback by his singing - it's really quite thin - his range is limited - his phrasing lacking nuance or depth.  It's almost painful to listen to him limp through this.  Also, the song selection mostly dreadfully boring stuff - with a few exceptions.  He's gone out of his way to choose some superficial little ditties which reminded me of the superficial little ditties he was writing back in the age of disco - and that's also too bad.<br /><br />The fact is - if you really need to buy a current release from an ex-Beatle right now - you'd be far better served by picking up Ringo's latest, instead.  It's far more ambitious and, at this point, Ringo's singing is actually more expressive than Paul's.  Imagine that!<br /><br />Or - if you really want to hear a lovely tenor voice singing selections from that great era of songwriting - you should go to Paul 's (and John's) old friend - Harry Nilsson and his Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night.  That wonderful recording is everything this one is not, but would like to be -  heartfelt, lively, quirky, magnificently arranged, and simply gorgeous.  Go ahead - search it on Amazon and take a listen to the samples.  Then purchase it instead of this piece of fluff.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|This is a horrible piece of hardware that is currently sitting, unused, on a shelf, collecting dust.<br /><br />I have recalibrated the Kinect several times with and without the Zoom and I have placed the Kinect above and below the TV with the lights dimmed, bright, etc.<br /><br />Just as most of the reviews have said, hand tracking is horrid.  In addition, you can from the Kinect window on the TV, the oom severely reduced the amount of ambient light that the camera can see and tracking issues occur constantly.<br /><br />The only thing this piece of plastic accomplished is that it scratched up the top of my Kinect.  I pre-ordered this back in July 2011 and the one I received (first shipments) did not come with any protection for the Kinect.  I believe it now ships with a cushion or cover or something to prevent this from happening.  Glad I was an early adopter and it will be a long time before I buy another piece of hardware from Nyko again.
1451683405|3.0|I have been arguing against free will for years now and have participated in many debates on the subject. When I heard Sam was releasing a book on the subject arguing against us having free will I was excited. Well, the book is just okay, not exceptional. Sam goes over some common topics that have to do with free will and why we don't have it but never goes in depth enough. It is a good but short beginners guide to why we don't have free will. People new to the subject might find it refreshing. But vet free will deniers like myself will find it lacking in detail and thoroughness.<br /><br />I think a thorough breakdown of \\"self\\" should have been examined to show how \\"I\\" am a product of the environment. Self must be defined and understood to understand why we don't have free will.<br /><br />While there is a chapter on cause and effect, the causality topic should have been a bigger part of this book to better demonstrate how deterministic nature is and how it makes it possible for us to make any meaningful predictions at all. If this was thoroughly examined it would show how there is no room for free will in our universe governed by the laws of physics and causality. Direct and indirect chain of events should have been examined.<br /><br />There are many other topics to cover that I will keep to myself for now and just release in my own book. There are few books on no free will, so I appreciate this effort and it will be an ok introduction to some people.

B0052YAKS6|3.0|I'm a fan of dance/electronica, but I don't often hear music in the genre that really excites me. Maybe because so much of dance music isn't really made to last ... it's disposable; meant to be enjoyed in the club or on the treadmill, but not meant to be still enjoyed or appreciated ten years into the future. The title \\"Nothing but the Beat\\" suggests an album full of dance floor/party jams for the present moment, and it offers that. The album is full of David Guetta's throbbing, crisp beats complemented by a variety of current pop/R&B talent.<br /><br />Occasionally, the album aims higher than just disposable dance floor filler and offers a track that is genuinely captivating and moving. \\"Turn Me On\\" features Nicki Minaj mostly singing (with just a brief rap), and when she cries \\"make me come alive\\" it seems like a genuine plea for authenticity in a disposable, digital world. \\"I Just Wanna F\\", a duet between Timbaland and Dev, offers inventive, percolating R rated banter that seems like a raunchier sequel to Nelly Furtado's \\"Promiscuous\\". \\"Lunar\\", a song without vocals, shows that when he's not collaborating with American pop stars, David Guetta's music actually shares a dialog with other French electronic musicians like Daft Punk and Mirwais.<br /><br />The album closes with a glorious track, \\"Titanium\\", featuring Australian singer Sia. Sia's textured, emotional voice has been featured on Zero 7's mellow electronic music, but when combined with Guetta's abrasive beats, magic happens.

1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris very convincingly shows that we do not have free will. He mentions some scientific experiments that take some delusional efforts to be reconciled with this incoherent notion of free will. He makes the point that I think most people miss which is that your lack of free will is very apparent when you really start paying attention to yourself. The points Sam makes in this book are great consciousness raisers, which is expected given that we are completely oblivious to most of the forces driving us. If you go into this book thinking that because you can deliberate you have free will, well, that's why it's an illusion. Sam makes a great argument.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is told through the eyes of Hazel - who was set to die of the Thyroid cancer she was diagnosed with at age twelve, until, at fourteen, a medical miracle managed to shrink the tumours in her lungs. Now sixteen, and despite being told she could live `for a long time', Hazel subsists tethered to an oxygen tank and shut off from the world.  That is, until Osteosarcoma survivor Augustus Waters walks into her Support Group and changes her life.<br /><br />In true John Green fashion, this book is somehow equal parts humour and pain. I didn't put it down until I was finished, and have now read it twice over, cover-to-cover.  Having been really charmed by one of his other works, An Abundance of Katherines, I had quite high expectations for The Fault in our Stars. This book has fulfilled those expectations and more. John Green should be applauded for his handling of the subject matter - and for managing to write a book about sick kids that wasn't a total bummer.<br /><br />I've heard it said that the voices of John Green's characters are too alike and that their personalities blur together. However, that hasn't been my experience. It could well be true, and I just haven't read enough of him to become jaded about the personalities he creates. But, in either case, I would still gladly spend a hundred books with characters like Hazel and Augustus.<br /><br />What I Loved:<br />So, John Green's characters have a way of winning me over, but the real standout is his writing.  It's so stunning and insightful that it makes you read a particular passage over and over.<br /><br />For instance,<br />\\"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.\\"<br /><br />I never thought I would be genuinely laughing out loud at a book about slow death by cancer - but it's so irreverent and unexpected and courageous that you forget what you're supposed to be feeling and just go with it. This may be a book about dying young, but it is so far from the usual Hallmark-movie style sob story that I can't really compare it to any other book about illness that I've ever read.<br /><br />What Was Lacking:<br />Nothing - for its genre, this book is as close to perfect as it gets.<br /><br />Quote:<br />\\"When you go into the ER, one of the first things they ask you to do is rate your pain on a scale of one to ten, and from there they decide which drugs to use and how quickly to use them.

B0015WJBR0|5.0|I recently bought this album and sat listening to it on a very good set of headphones. All I can say is WOW! This group has taken the time to intelligently fill in all the minor gaps in the music without cluttering what you are hearing. I could refer them as Beach Boys meet E.L.P./Genesis/Yes/Marillion and many more, but I won't. This is a group in its own right. The harmonies are flawless and the complex musicianship would put a lot of classical composers to shame! Buy this album before you can't buy it anymore. Give it a few listens and you will surely be hooked and will probably buy all their stuff. p.s. This is all I play in my car at the moment.
B004VF68AQ|3.0|The shortest of the Jane's Addiciton studio albums, The Great Escape Artist was released in 2011 by Capitol Records who also released 2003's \\"Strays\\". Bass playing duties on the album are shared by producer Dave Sitek and Dave Navarro and three of the tracks included were co-written by Guns N' Roses founding bassist Duff McKagan. At 39 minutes long this is the shortest Jane's Addiction album, but I believe it handily bests 2003's Strays. That isn't to say there aren't some great tracks on Strays like Just Because and The Riches, but The Great Escape Artist is great from start to finish.<br /><br />Does this sound like classic Jane's? Somewhat no: there are more electronic effects and production techniques at play here and there are no monstrous bass-driven songs like Three Days, Ted, Just Admit It, Then She Did, etc., that Avery brought to the table. But somewhat yes: the songs are still on par with other classic Jane's tracks like Had A Dad and Stop!, the guitar work is unmistakable Navarro complete with some new tricks up his sleeve. He's obviously been experimenting a little more with newer processing techniques on the sound, or at least new to him and perhaps not so new to The Edge from u2. It rocks hard just like classic Jane's did. End to the Lies has that monstrous guitar wall that you find in Ocean Size. It's Jane's Addiction and it kicks ass.<br /><br />When I caught the band recently on their \\"Theater of the Escapists\\" tour they played four tracks from the new album. End of the Lies which one can only presume is about Eric A., Twisted Tales, the opening track Underground was the show's opener and the first song in the encore was the album's closing \\"Words Right Out of My Mouth\\". The new tracks work well in the live setting as the do on the album.<br /><br />Again there is no \\"Three Days\\" here, the longest track, Splash a Little Water on It, comes in at just over 5 minutes long. The songs are powerful though, just not as meandering. Farrell comments that there was enough material for 3 albums, so who knows what lies ahead. Perkins and Navarro provide a great solid rhythm section throughout the album as they always have done, and with Jane's Addiction's studio material you get to hear every word Perry says and really appreciate the range he still has in his 50's. In the live setting even when on, and in the front row, it's not always to hear Perry in the mix.<br /><br />I am really surprised at how mixed the reviews for the album are, I loved the first side immediately upon listening and the second side I thought was a little weaker, but having now listened through the album more than 6 times I think it's well balanced and the record plain and simple just rocks.<br /><br />A 40 minute record divides pretty nicely into just under 20 minutes a side on the vinyl, which is really the maximum length you want to shoot for before you start sacrificing sound quality. The vinyl is well pressed, nice and quiet, and the dynamics are a little better than the CD although that's not saying much. Unfortunately after ruining the last four Red Hot Chili Peppers records mastering engineer Vlado Meller has had his hands all over this new Jane's Addiction album and the result is another victory for the Loudness Wars and another defeat for fidelity and dynamic music. PLEASE VLADO - STOP RUINING RECORDS!!!!<br /><br />The CD won't sound too bad on the go with cheaper in-ear buds or in a car, but if you're going to enjoy this on a hifi system I'd definitely recommend going with the vinyl instead. However it does sound like the vinyl was made from a master that was very close to the CD and to be honest it sounds pretty bad if you throw this on in the middle of listening to records that are more dynamic like the new 2012 pressing of Chili Peppers' \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" or the Ryko pressing of either of Jane's Addiction's first two studio albums.<br /><br />DR log of the CD:<br />Number of files:  10<br />Official DR value:  DR5<br /><br />Inshort, great music, terrible mastering = for non-critical listening only. If Meller hadn't butchered the mastering I'd easily give this four stars.<br /><br />When will the loudness wars insanity end?short, great music, terrible mastering = for non-critical listening only.

It quite literally rips the blinders off on suicide of teenagers and forces you to look at the grim reality that most teenage suicide isn't because of simple depression but the end of a snowball of horrible experience that could have been stopped. I'm sure there are people out there who say \\"don't read this book\\" or that it's too much for teenagers to handle but this couldn't be so far from the truth.<br /><br />  The story is that a girl at Clay's school has committed suicide and a few days later Clay gets a box of tapes all of which the girl explaining why she committed suicide and in places of the story she tells even points out that she could have been saved. The story follows clay as he listens to the tapes and he uptime fly changes his life because of it.<br /><br />  As a Advanced Youth Trainer of Nonviolence,I love the fact that she brings up the fact that had anyone intervened or even had noticed her she wouldn't have committed suicide. I find this is true. When we hear in the new of a suicide we don't say what could have been done to prevent that, instead we just go on with our lives uncaring because that person isn't someone we know. More than likely even if we say went to the same school but had never talked we too would just move on. The realitity of our existence however is that we touch people every day whether we realize it or not. We are people who can make changes. Who knows if you just saying high to a person might mean that they find the courage to live just one more day. Teenagers need this book more than ever, especially with the increase in bullying, so they can learn how to be more aware in their environment and can realize that the way we treat people has an impact. Especially for this concept. I wished schools would incorporate this book just because it is so rich in content in learning chances.<br /><br />  For those who are still worried about giving this book to a teenager, it might help to know that the book doesn't say suicide is good or that others should try it, think of the title as saying: 13 reasons why I committed suicide and how I coulld have been helped. This is such an empowering book that even if a parent and teen read it together the book still has its meaning behind it. It might even create an opportunity to open a dialog about what is going on in school. Talking about how our actions or words can hurt people and if you feel your teen is suicidal you may be able to start a dialog about identifying why they want to die and bringing it further to what do you feel you need to be saved.<br /><br />  This is one book you shouldn't miss out on and one you should diffidently pick up. It reads quickly and can inspire you on ways to become more aware of others and how to understand the people you see around you. I can garuntee you this book will change the way you think and act from then on.

1451648537|5.0|It is not surprising that Walter Isaacson would write a flawless, magnificent portrayal of the man that has influenced just about everyone around the world. Steve Jobs was not without his faults; and Walter portrays the very essence of his persona in the most eloquent, yet honest way. Some might say it is not an \\"easy\\" read; well, Steve Jobs was not an \\"easy\\" man. And the very flaws that many ascribe to him became the powerful forces by which he tackled the world of technology and transformed the computer world as we know it. Bravo to Isaacson and to Jobs, both of whom took the time and courage to produce this intriguing, one-of-a kind work.
0312427565|1.0|.<br />A big part of having the \\"right stuff,\\" Wolfe writes, is not being \\"left behind.\\"<br /><br />Coming in second is not the right stuff, he says.<br /><br />Yet his whole example--the 7 former test pilots in the Mercury space program--came in behind the Russians. Not only did the program follow the Russians, it didn't come close to matching Soviet efforts.<br /><br />Being second and far behind does not meet Wolfe's definition of the right stuff.<br /><br />The first man in space was a Russian on April 12, 1961. He orbited the earth. Three weeks later an American went up--no orbit.<br /><br />The Russian Vostok 2 mission did 17 orbits on August 6. When the Americans finally orbited over 6 months later--in 1962!-- their mission circled only 3 times.<br /><br />I don't argue that the Russian program was perfect or achieved without high cost.<br /><br />But Wolfe's never realizing his thesis isn't proved by his example is sad. The florid overwriting and multiplicity of exclamation points eventually make the book cloying.<br /><br />A small bright spot in this miasma is the description of the California desert and test pilot culture early in the book.
0439023491|3.0|**Warning, this review could contain spoilers**<br /><br />Ok, so I have to admit I've become fully blown obsessed about this series.  I even want a little Mockingjay pin that I would actually wear and show my geeky side with.  That being said, I'll never rate this book five stars despite my obsession because of some of its errors.  But in the end, I can't wait to read the 3rd book (although I suspect that's more because of the first book than this one) so I can't rate this one too poorly.<br /><br />Catching Fire is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  Do not try to read this book as a stand-alone.  You will be completely lost.  These are the kind of books that should be read in order.  And you won't regret reading the first one anyway, so if you haven't read it yet, go start there.<br /><br />After winning the games with Peeta, the first joint winners ever, Katniss returns home to District 12.  There she tries to get back to her life, but nothing is the same.  And when the six month tour of the districs comes around, as a winner of the Hunger Games she is compelled to go and put on the show that she and Peeta are madly in love, even though she's not sure what her feeling are.  And worse yet, the President of the Capital, knows its just a ruse, and he suspects that others think the same when signs of rebellion start appearing all over the districts.  Eager to stop the rebellion in its tracks, he makes some not so veiled threats to Katniss, and she finds that she is not as safe as she thought she was.<br /><br />Katniss has never really been a likable character.  And that's actually ok.  Its kind of refreshing to have a main character who isn't likable.  Peeta on the other hand, is just as charming as ever.  I would have really liked to see more character development for everyone else though.  There are so many important people in Katniss' life that it seems a shame they are never really fully explored.  Although her clothing designer does get some great moments in this book.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this book would be the pacing.  I understand its a middle book, but really, it is just mainly filler.  Instead of taking an in-depth look at the different colonies they tour, more time is spent on Katniss' wardrobe.  And I just don't understand that.  Same with the action at the end, it didn't take long at all and by all accounts it should have been the largest part of the book.  But it was just too rushed.  I did like that we got a little bit of what was happening after the games filled in though.  It would have been nice to see them but at least Collins kept us in the loop.  I'm also not a fan of Collins use of the first person, I think this story would gain so much more by being in the 3rd person.  We'd get more background on the world and things that aren't as important to Katniss but are important to a reader.<br /><br />It was good to get more background but after Hunger Games I expected much much more from this book.  I am still very eager to read the 3rd book though!<br /><br />Catching Fire<br />Copyright 2009<br />391 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. It's so pointless but I love it. It's highly addictive:)  and fun and quirky
B0060Q962Q|2.0|There are better (yet still attractive)  version of this game without the extra bells a whistles this game has. Stuff like the [choices of]  music just adds bloat and does nothing to improve the experience over the competition.<br /><br />A &quot;4 in a row&quot; game should not require WiFi to download.  This game is mostly bloat.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|OK, there are plenty of great song-by-song reviews here, so I'll try not to repeat what you may have already read.  The thing that most impresses me about \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is that it really breaks new ground, musically.  Sure, there's no mistaking the Boss' voice and songwriting, but the musicianship here is sometimes shocking and almost always invigorating.  Some may take him to task for his politics (and truth be told, I like \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" even though I question the validity of what amounts to Bush-bashing in 2012), but Springsteen has been making statements about the country in his music for at least 30 years.  If you don't like what he has to say, just don't listen.  It's not like you will hear many of these songs on the radio anyway, since the majority of listeners have given the Top 40 format over to unoriginal hip hop noise.<br /><br />And therein lies the point, and the problem.  Bruce's fans are loyal, and most of us will buy each new release even though the guy hasn't had a true hit single in 15 years (the 1997 re-release of \\"Secret Garden\\").  Keeping album-oriented rock music alive is a tall order to fill these days.  But hey, if anyone can do it. . .<br /><br />For those who have remained loyal, here's how \\"Wrecking Ball\\" stacks up to the rest of the new millenium Springsteen catalog: Better than DEVILS AND DUST and WE SHALL OVERCOME, much better than WORKING ON A DREAM, and a slight improvement over MAGIC (which I don't feel held together as well as an album, despite a handful of great songs).  It does not, however, top THE RISING, which I feel was his best record since TUNNEL OF LOVE.<br /><br />Do make sure and get the Deluxe Edition, as it includes two decent bonus tracks.  The only issue I have with this version is that the CD sleeve (I don't call this fragile cardboard crap a \\"case\\")is oversized--about the size of one of the old 5\\" floppy discs.  So storage could be a problem if you use a standard-size CD holder.

0375869026|5.0|This is a wonderful story.  I got it for my daughter, but when it arrived, I sat down to read the first page.  I didn't get up again until I was half way through.  As indicated in the summary, Auggie suffers from a horrible facial birth defect.  The story follows him from the re-telling of his birth to his first day in public school.  We get to experience firsthand how Auggie feels, as well as how he affects those around him.  The author tells the story from different points of view, including Via, Auggie's sister, and Summer, his school friend.  I really loved that she did that.  It makes Auggie more 3 dimensional and reminds us that we do not exist in a bubble.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this book.  YOU HAVE TO READ IT.  It will stay with you long after you have put it down.<br /><br />Oh, my 13 year old daughter agrees, Wonder should be required reading for middle school.

0307592731|4.0|Stricken with grief at her mother's passing, and laden with guilt brought on by her infidelity and drug addiction, Strayed decides to hike the eleven-hundred-mile Pacific Crest Trail as a means to escape the inner turmoil and to find a direction in life.<br /><br />In \\"Wild,\\" Strayed recounts her experiences on the Pacific Crest Trail in considerable detail while she ruminates on the loss of her mother to cancer and on her moral failings. With unflinching honesty, she writes about the grief of losing her mom as well as her escapades involving drug use and infidelity. Strayed's preoccupation with sex is immediately apparent from the get-go and her lascivious yearnings pervade much of the memoir. I found the seedier parts of the memoir rather fascinating, but nothing more.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Strayed's account of her hike. I found myself immersed in her experience and I was able to vicariously appreciate both the rigors and joys of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. In this regard, my experience with \\"Wild\\" closely parallels my experience with \\"[[ASIN:0307279464 A Walk in the Woods]],\\" a delightful account of the author's experience on the Appalachian Trail.<br /><br />Strayed writes well, and with a smattering of humor. Overall, \\"Wild\\" was a fairly enjoyable read, but nothing in the book really resonated with me, except perhaps her grief in the loss of her mom.

0767827902|4.0|This might be the saddest movie that I have ever watched. It is not depressing; merely sad. The film is a character study of people in a small Texas town, and those people are going absolutely nowhere. They are just screwing around, literally. The movie is drenched in sex, and follows the sex lives of just about everybody in it. However, they are not having any fun in bed. The sex here is not the least bit enjoyable (for you, or them). Mostly these folks seem to be merely attempting to find some passion in life. But they don't find it. Their sex lives are tedious, or nervous, or both -- like most people's. This devotion to reality, the way life really is, depicting ordinary people acting ordinary, is the core strength of The Last Picture Show. I suspect that it is also the reason why the movie had to be filmed in black and white. These folks have no color in their lives.<br /><br />The film is marvelously acted. Perhaps the most difficult acting is to act typical, to speak lines which reflect the way that average people speak and to behave the way that average people behave. Almost every actor here pulls it off well. I felt as though I knew these people, and that I liked them.<br /><br />Ben Johnson won an Oscar for his performance of Sam the Lion, and he deserved it because Sam was the only person in town who actually seemed to have made an attempt to live a full life. Yet, even he failed. Ben Johnson communicates the honesty of a man like Sam. A man who knows he gave life his best shot, but still failed. Sam is the only character in this movie who is at peace with himself.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman also won an Oscar for her roll as the lonely housewife of the local High School coach. She seems to symbolize the frustrations of whole town.<br /><br />Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges turn in excellent performances as anxious teenage friends who take entirely different approaches to their sex lives.<br /><br />Cybil Shepard's performance is slightly uneven, but still convincing as the insecure and sexually manipulative Jaycy.<br /><br />For practical purposes there is no plot. Since these people aren't going anywhere, there is no real movement, thus no overall plot. Still, it is a marvelous character study of typical people -- lonely and nervous. The reason that the movie is merely sad, and not depressing, is because all of the characters are portrayed sympathetically. They are easy to like and easy to relate to. Plus, even though the ending sad, somehow it is also hopeful. Not optimistic; just hopeful -- quietly, nervously hopeful.<br /><br />Brilliant though it is, as convincing as the acting is, and despite the marvelous cinematography, I am sure that I will never watch it again. It is too sad.convincing as the insecure and sexually manipulative Jaycy.<br /><br />For practical purposes there is no plot.

0440237688|4.0|It's not \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave New World\\". The writing does not measure up to even the less well known Huxley or Orwell novels. But, it is not just some dumbed-down version of a dystopian tale, or a gussied up action/adventure fantasy with a message.<br /><br />  Rather, it is thoughtful and workmanlike attempt to introduce ya readers to dystopian literature and to literary novels of ideas. (It that regard it seems to be in the same class as Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\".) I don't see how you help a reader grow into more adult fare without having this volume at least available.
0374105235|5.0|An amazing story of a young man trying to escape from a fear that most of us will never know. It's a harsh wake up call to the horrors that are happening around us, though with a happy ending that is well deserved; though for many never happen.<br /><br />Beah, a boy who wants to live a normal boys life of causing mischief and chaos has a rude awakening when rebel soldiers raid the village where he lives. His harrowing journey transforms Beah from a young boy to a man in a boys body.<br />I will not tell you any more of the story because it is most defiantly worth buying.<br /><br />This story is totally worth the cost, and with the Kony 2012 happening right now, it gives you a good and truthful insight to whats truly happening in Africa. This story was enjoyable as well as saddening to know that some kids live in this sort of fear, not knowing if they will be killed next. This is a story of the harsh realities of life, opening your eyes into another's world; one you may never know.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|****This review contains spoilers****<br /><br />This movie is scary, and I can honestly say it shook me to the core. I'm chalking the 1-star reviews up to just mistaken expectations: this is NOT an action film, and it's not paced like an action film. If you expect that, prepare for disappointment. Sad to say, many people (myself included, at this point in the \\"review\\") confuse reviews for meandering expressions of baseless opinion. In the interest of injecting this review with some protein. I want to begin with a bit of an aside:<br /><br />Why does it seem like everyone insists on assuming the climaxes in movies are dreams? Is this the Lost effect? The Inception effect? Isn't claiming it's all a dream merely a cheap fix for an ending that doesn't tie up neatly with our notion of endings?<br /><br />This movie is about love and loss (of mental health, of family, of a way of life); it's about the epic Real that we cannot explain with our frames of reference but only with silence. It's also a movie about an event that does or doesn't happen. I'm going to discuss certain aspects of the film: the use of minor characters to develop and texture that of Curtis, the main characters, and the interplay between husband and wife during their vacation (the final scene).<br /><br />Mental illness is capable of being an apocalypse. Specifically, mental illness and natural disaster take us outside of civilization and behavior. Acting along prescribed behavioral lines in both cases is either impossible and/or difficult and not what the situation calls for. We see Michael Shannon's character as someone who first plays it off, then attempts to reject it with modern medicine, and only finally embracing it. They will never understand, I imagined him thinking.<br /><br />At first I was skeptical of introducing \\"sideline\\" characters for one or two scenes (the mother, the brother), only to never mention them again. On second thought, though, the brother showing up out of concern and leaving with the dog was interesting and very well done. Here's why: sometimes having characters come in and out and then totally disappear from the plot annoys viewers because this leaves behind loose ends and questions. In this case, it wasn't a loose end at all: people come in and out of our lives. And in a family fractured by a mother's mental illness, the distant relationship of the brothers is awkward and palpable. It's here we see Shannon's character chase away his brother, his dog (\\"man's best friend\\"), then his best friend. He's left at the end to fend for himself and his family precisely because he's severed ties in order to save himself and his family. The ending on the deck shows us a picture of desperation in the face of catastrophic disaster which \\"ironically\\" (only insofar as we expect nothing to go wrong on vacation) happens during the vacation taken to get away from his shelter and illness. And yet the catastrophe is always near. Nature knows: the birds always know; the daughter knows, and she feels it. Her signing on the beach illustrates this. She's just felt the earthquake. She didn't feel the storm while they were in the shelter, and it's what gives the father strength to open the door: the moment is expressed with silence, because there's no explanation why they're alive. Just luck. I've written on imdb that this could be a father's wish that his hearing impaired daughter \\"join the world\\" and interact with the same \\"normative\\" organic interconnectedness that our senses bring about, except that even the minor characters in this film struggle with alienation and uncertainty. Minor characters mention how lucky the family is to have good health coverage, a good job. Several times we hear about risks \\"in this economy.\\" For the main character and his family, things are pretty good. Until the illness. Letting go and getting away from the shelter, only to have our need to rely on our \\"illness\\" come rushing back into focus -- two water spouts, tidal wave, brown rain -- is probably not how we envision a partner or spouse regaining trust in our mental acuity.<br /><br />The wife's face in the final scene reflects the disbelief that the main character struggles with until he embraces his illness as something more than illness. For a moment, we see the projection of his confusion and \\"can this really be happening?\\" in her expression. Who can't relate to the feeling of beginning to understand while simultaneously questioning whether we're not the ones losing our grasp on reality? Coming to this realization is textured by the gravity of what came before: that while being supportive, the wife hasn't understood the husband's illness because to understand it would mean to know that your vacation would lead to your death. There is no *actual* way to prepare and take shelter because disaster is sudden, much like the onset of the husband's illness. So the wife can only frame her husband's dreams as indicative of an illness. She can only do that, until the end. It's this last scene's switch (the disbelief in him to now what we're witnessing) that makes it necessary. I found myself wishing at first that they had just ended it with the family looking toward the ocean, like the blinding light when Shannon's character opens the shelter door earlier on, but my wish seemed even more exaggerated (like the \\"event\\" that occurs outside in the beginning of The Road, for example) and leading at this point. Ending it this way, Nichols downplays the event and instead opens the dialog about just how little we know about mental illness. What a mesmerizing film!
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|There were a number of interesting points made by Dawkins in the first half of the book.  The second half?  I slogged through it and did not enjoy the arguments.<br /><br />When Dawkins stays within his area of expertise (biology), the book danced along. However, I would have liked to have learned more on the evolution of DNA.  Why does the human genome have so many inactive gene packets?  How did DNA develop from Earth's chemisty, and when?  Evolution is not a hard sell...it's fairly logical and observable.  DNA development?  Looking at Drew Berry's CGA of DNA and cell division leaves one in awe of its complexity. Given billions of years and the observation that many \\"things\\" seem to grow at an exponential rate, DNA seem arguably the area of inquiry that should have been addressed in more depth.<br /><br />I've viewed a number of Dawkins talks available on line.  Most recently, a 2 hour discussion-oriented format with Lawrence Krauss.  I must say that Dr. Dawkins \\"in person\\" is a lot more genial than Dr. Dawkins \\"in print\\".  Less sententious.<br /><br />Overall, if given the chance to read Dawkins or Campbell on areas outside of biology , I'd send an agnostic toward Campbell.
0385342039|4.0|What a fun book.  I loved Aunt Sophie and Lara was so funny.  The things that Great Aunt Sophie caused her to do were hysterical.  This book will leave you smiling.  What could be bad, and a ghost Great Aunt who won't go away until she gets her necklace back.  A young 29 year old whose life is in big trouble being haunted.  You will laugh and feel sad to see Sophie go.  This is not the last great novel but if you need an escape and want a good read this will do.

B005LAIH2W|3.0|John Carter will more than likely be the first big flop of 2012. With its $250 million budget, the 79 years it spent stuck in development hell, and one of the worst marketing campaigns since Grindhouse, John Carter certainly has its work cut out for it. While the blockbuster film may not be quite as bad as some expect it to be, it will more than likely rub audiences the wrong way and hurt its chances at the box office.<br /><br />John Carter is a lot like Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones in the way that its special effects are really outstanding, but everything else is kind of boring. Every inch of dialogue feels like it goes on forever and seems very drawn out. Short responses and one-liners are kept to a minimum. Everyone has a story to tell, a device to build, a scientific method to explain, a home to get back to, a war to prevent, or a marriage to run away from. It just winds up feeling a bit too over explanatory at times and about forty five minutes too long.<br /><br />Even though the majority of John Carter takes place on Mars, it almost doesn't really seem to matter. There are three or four really outstanding action sequences, but it's like the drama between characters is more important than this fantastic new world John finds himself in or the otherworldly technology he now finds at his fingertips. \\"There's a battle going on right over there! We should probably jump in, right?\\" \\"Probably, but let me tell you the history of my people first, why I don't trust you, and why I think you're crazy for saying you're from Earth.\\" It has the same issue that last year's The Adventures of Tintin did in the way that when the action hits it's memorable, exciting, and exactly the type of thing you like to pay to see but everything in the middle continues to drag. Some sort of understanding of this new world is required, but this felt like a little much.<br /><br />What the action film is able to get done right is done in the best of ways. John Carter is pure ecstasy to look at. Mars is in a word; breathtaking. That structure John, Dejah Thoris, and Sola run into out on the water before John and Dejah go inside and discover the ninth ray is just an amazing sequence overall that practically parallels the first visit to Pandora in Avatar. There's the battle sequence where John takes on an entire army on his own while we're shown the memory of his previous family and of course the coliseum scene with the two white apes. These three sequences are reason alone to see this extremely expensive dose of eye candy.<br /><br />The cast is just really astounding, as well. Taylor Kitsch proves he's able to handle the leading man role with ease even if he does seem to be doing it with Christian Bale's Batman voice and you can't really go wrong with Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, Mark Strong, James Purefoy, and Bryan Cranston in your supporting cast.<br /><br />It's not that John Carter is a bad film. In fact, it's a lot better than you're probably expecting. It even has shades of some of the biggest action and adventure films of all time. Aside from Star Wars and Avatar, I found myself recollecting Raiders of the Lost Ark and even The NeverEnding Story. There is greatness at its core, but there is a lot of weakness to get through to actually reach that destination. Its 132 minute duration is exhausting, the pacing is extremely slow at times, and the film seems pretty dull and boring during its slower moments. I'm pretty sure every child was crying at some point that came to the theater that night. Despite being visually stunning and featuring some spectacular special effects, John Carter is structurally boring the majority of the time. Long before I had the chance to see this, I had guessed it would be the Green Lantern of 2012 and that's a pretty accurate comment to describe this film. I'm sure Mark Strong could vouch for that.cstasy to look at. Mars is in a word; breathtaking. That structure John, Dejah Thoris, and Sola run into out on the water before John and Dejah go inside and discover the ninth ray is just an amazing sequence overall that practically parallels the first visit to Pandora in Avatar. There's the battle sequence where John takes on an entire army on his own while we're shown the memory of his previous family and of course the coliseum scene with the two white apes. These three sequences are reason alone to see this extremely expensive dose of eye candy.<br /><br />The cast is just really astounding, as well. Taylor Kitsch proves he's able to handle the leading man role with ease even if he does seem to be doing it with Christian Bale's Batman voice and you can't really go wrong with Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, Mark Strong, James Purefoy, and Bryan Cranston in your supporting cast.<br /><br />It's not that John Carter is a bad film. In fact, it's a lot better than you're probably expecting. It even has shades of some of the biggest action and adventure films of all time.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use and stay on track with goals. there are so many options for readings plans Nd special seasonal plans so you don't get bored.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My partner and I purchased this after renting it from Netflix.  We absolutely LOVE this movie and have watched it multiple times in the past few years.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Thank you so much for the privilege of using your app for even more time, sleeping at night is so overrated, I'd much rather repeat work I've already done.  Some people might consider the save button not working to be a bug, but with how wonderful this app is, it's obviously a feature designed to extend the wonderful experience beyond all normal working hours.  Sure, I need to get this done, but who needs sleep when I can sit here and do the same work over and over again until well past dawn?  Truly visionary.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It keeps me entertained for hours. My grandchildren are also enjoying the game. Its great for teaching them patience.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Works fine with Fire. Would give it a 5 except the game itself is widely available on other platforms. Been playing it for a decade. Highly recommended.
B004LWZW88|1.0|I too was looking forward to seeing this movie unfortunately the previews were the only good parts of the movie.  my grandson who loved the Shrek movies was as bored as I was. I never write reviews but just had to throw my two cents in because the high percent of ratings is why I bought this clunker I will pay more attention to all the reviews in the future live and learn
B0060Q962Q|3.0|Kindle Fire user.  This game can only be played in landscape mode, and the game board and pieces are distorted in shape...the board is stretched to be more rectangular than normal, and the playing pieces are ovular instead of circular.  This is an annoying visual quirk that takes away from the game more than you would suspect.  Also, the sound effects are too elaborate to be repeated every time a piece is dropped.  Optime Software's version of this game is simpler yet superior, with more accurate shapes and less annoying sounds.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|Downloaded for wife who like the Bacon version a lot. BUT this??? Girl is hot for sure but guy is no Bacon in any way. Why was he cast in this?? Slow, prodding. If you interested in Footloose see the Bacon version. This version is not recommended at all.
0316098329|5.0|Room is about a nineteen-year-old college student who has been kept as a prisoner in a barred-up garden shed for seven years.  The room has a hot plate and a sink, a toilet and a television.  Her captor brings her enough food to survive (mostly canned food and junk food), disciplines her by cutting off electricity and heat, and rapes her several times a week.  She conceives and gives birth to a son she calls Jack, and Room is told from his perspective, which takes a bit of getting used to, because Jack is only five years old, and he doesn't understand figures of speech, or that he is a prisoner, or that there is a whole world outside of the room he's lived in his whole life.<br /><br />His mother does everything she can to bury her anguish and to make life as normal as she can for Jack.  They watch Dora the Explorer on television, they play ball together (the ball is a bag stuffed with paper), and \\"Ma\\" even reads the stories of Jesus to him.<br /><br />Slowly as the weeks go by, Ma tells Jack about the outside world and that this is where she wants to return.  Together, they attempt to escape from the dreary shed.  The suspense is tremendous, and the book is hard to put down.<br /><br />The broad theme of the book is about coping and learning to survive with extremely trying circumstances.  Jack's mother is an extraordinary person who copes with life as a captive while trying to make her son's life as stress free as she can, while Jack must later learn to cope with life in a world he knows next to nothing about.  This theme should resonate with the Christian community, for we too must cope with trying circumstances (even if they are less harsh than the ones Jack and his mother face).  Like Jack and his mother, we too have the stories of Jesus to inspire us and give us strength.  This book definitely touches on issues that matter to parishioners and can be a preacher's source for illustrative material.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|You may be looking for more subtlety in the lyrics from Bruce because that is what he has focused on since Tunnel of Love.<br />However, if you like his earlier stuff and especially The River (Sherry Darling, You can look, I'm a Rocker, Independence day, The Price you pay, Drive all night), then you will love this album -so musically superb- and still poetic and relevant.<br />My fave is \\"We are Alive\\"....maybe he is talking about all the characters on the River??????????????<br /><br />Hearing these in concert should be fun!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is one of the best books I have ever read! The whole time you are reading it, you are captivated. It isn't one of those loves stories where everything is happy and always good, it is a book that breaks your heart then puts it back together then breaks it again. Truley best book I have read in a long time.

B004Z4LVZK|3.0|Title: The Maze Runner<br />Author: James Dashner<br />Rating: 3.5 Stars<br /><br />What I Loved<br /><br />First of all, this story has one of the greatest openers of all time.  As in child slides into the world confused, blinking, and outraged great.  It has that same 'what the heck is going on', crawling out of a dark hole into the unknown kind of feeling.  I have to admit that the opener really built the tension and got me excited for the overall story.<br /><br />Sicko that I am, I LOVED the MAZE!  It is so freakishly wrong, so fantastically terrifying, so devilishly clever.  As a trained researcher with a vivid imagination, the idea of people being the 'rats' in a maze has obviously occurred to me many times.  I just think the author's ability to envision it from the point of view of the rat is fascinating.  Of course, he imagined a maze more horrifying than any I believe has been designed for a rat (scratch that, probably not sadly).  Let's just say that the maze is very, very, very messed up.  You can see and feel the way that the boys are being manipulated into varying decisions by the Creators.  It must be horrible to be cognizant that one is part of an experiment and yet be unable to escape.  And the Grievers are the most disgusting and messed up part of all.  The only thing I wished was that I understood better the proposed science behind the experiment.  How did they create these odd biological/mechanical death machines?  What are the beetle blades and how did they create them?  So many questions still...<br /><br />The EPILOGUE - Very enticing and exciting!  I don't wish to include spoilers so I'll just say that it has the 'come hither' touch.<br />What I Liked<br /><br />Alby, Newt, and Minho.  This probably says a lot because none of these guys is one of the actual two main characters, Thomas and Theresa.  I think that for some reason you get to know who these guys are, through Thomas' eyes, more than you do Thomas.  And Theresa is a mystery all theway through.  If I didn't know this was a series, I'd be annoyed by how little I know about her besides the fact that she is strikingly pretty and telepathic with Thomas.  But the author is clearly holding his Theresa cards close to his vest for future installments.  Otherwise, I liked these three Keepers a great deal.  They were very different personalities but they were bright and tough and focused.  I believed I would follow them too if I were the Greenbean like Thomas.  A desperate situation like theirs, in which children are dying in terrible ways, calls for that kind of harsh, steadfast leadership.<br /><br />Thomas, at times.  Sometimes Thomas bugged me and sometimes I really liked him.  I liked his determination and perseverance and the scene when he saves Alby is absolutely amazing.  At that point in the story you become 100% on his side.  I think one of the things that makes it difficult to connect with Thomas is that even though you are 'in his head', he doesn't remember very much about himself as a person.  His memory has been wiped clean of personal memories and he is a bit of a 'blank slate'.  For this reason you end up feeling the same way about him, or at least, I did.  I CAN say though that it adds a lot of mystery to the question of whether Thomas is a 'good guy' or a 'bad guy'.  This suspense is the positive side of the mystery that is Thomas.<br />What Was Not My Favorite<br /><br />Pacing - Although I have read longer stories with more attention and eagerness, I found my attention wandering at times with this one.  At times I think the author killed his own tension.  For example, (and this is a tiny itty spoiler FYI), when Theresa arrives and she is all crazy and sticks her hand up in the air with the piece of paper that says, \\"She's the last one.  Ever.\\", I got actual chills.  CHILLS.  And then....nothing.  For a long time.  This is not to say that nothing happened, there was still a lot going on, but nothing related to the girl and her significance.  It almost made me put it down I was so mad at the time.  But like I said, I realize the author is keeping secrets about Theresa still and maybe I respect him for that.  I wanted more information all the time and at times found the pace of not getting it frustrating.<br /><br />Also, interestingly, the language.  They make up a replacement word for the f-bomb and I get that it might be realistic that they'd do this, but once you catch on to their slang it feels just like cursing and they curse so much it's a little distracting.  I say that having dealt with that in Eden's Root (some of you may have engaged in this discussion with me on FB).  Given the horror of the situation in which they find themselves, the level of cursing may be believable, so I think my reticence here is more preferential than an actual knock on the story.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend it, particularly to those who like apocalyptic, science-fiction, or dystopians.  The details of the darkness are amazing.  I am going to read the rest of the Trilogy.
B002BWQ586|5.0|World War Z consists of a series of interviews with men and women who survived the zombie war (World War Z). Each interview focuses on a specific place and time in the zombie war, and those interviewed vary in terms of diversity. The story is set not far in the future, when the global political situation is very nearly the same as it is today. Brooks chronicles the very first isolated outbreaks in China; the zombie disease very quickly spreads to Africa, where it is thought to be a form of rabies. A major medical corporation, hoping to cash in on the scare African Rabies has caused, develops an entirely ineffective but well-selling drug called Phalanx to fight the unusual disease. Despite the media attention African Rabies receives, many nations do not see the outbreaks as cause for major concern, and only Israel quarantines itself and prepares for the imminent disaster. A period towards the start of the war, known as the Great Panic, coincides with the world's sudden realization that this disease is not something to be taken lightly. China, due to it's large population and ineffective leadership, is very quickly over-run, and infected Chinese refugees help to spread the blight to America and Europe. It's not long before the zombie population outnumbers the human population around the world. In many of the major cities in North America and Europe the disease also spreads quickly, and humanity suffers a crushing defeat in a New York suburb when the United States military attempts to face off against approximately 100,000 zombies in the streets. Many combat techniques prove to be worthless against the zombie hordes because zombies do not rely on tactics or leaders. Militaries around the world must make whole new strategies, tactics, and weapons if the zombies are to be defeated successfully. Everyone else who isn't actively fighting provides labor, making weapons and feeding the army.<br /><br />Things that I liked about this book was that it was taken in many different perspectives. Starting with the doctor who first handled Patient 0, to the New York mother that gave her life for her children. Another thing I enjoyed about this book was the fact that it wasn't all violence and killing(although it does have its fair share) the author actually discusses the real life problems that would occur if Zombies were overrunning the world. Brooks discusses the problems Governments would have and how the epidemic spread. Something that I disliked about this novel was that I wanted it to last longer and hopefully it becomes a movie! Altogether I give this book a 5 start rating an hopefully some day I would give the movie the same.
1401207510|4.0|Honestly, I don't care for the extras. I don't look at the extras on DVDs, I don't read the extras at the back of these books... I want the story. And I want the story in the best format possible.<br /><br />I got this book at the Amazon.com discount, and I'm perfectly content with it. Its slim, but it has the story which is why I bought it in the first place. Like the rest of the Absolute versions, this LoXG volume fits nicely and uniformly on my shelf. Its oversized, so the pages are huge (duh), and it is exactly what I expected when I purchased it.<br /><br />Buyer beware, right?<br /><br />I'm also going to get the \\"absolute-esque\\" version of LoEG: Century when they publish it. Obviously its not a DC Absolute title, but it'll have the same dimensions, and a promise of \\"extras\\" for you that need that kind of content. And it'll fit nicely on the shelf with the rest of the books.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|i was looking for another book to read and this book was suggested over n over to me. I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS STORY, Travis is a sexy beast! I recommend this book if your looking for a story that you can get lost in and characters u can sink ur teeth into!

B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a fun but difficult game. I love.playing it!!! there's so much games to choose from. a lot fun!
0385535139|5.0|I am a fan of John Grisham and really loved this book.  The book starts out with a lawyer who can't bring himself to go to work at his big fancy law firm.  He gets to work and turns around and leaves.  He just can't go to work and sit at a desk for the rest of his life.  I found this book very funny and would highly recommend it.
0399250573|3.0|Nice ending so much better than Crocodile tears the book just before this one.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what Anthony Horowitz does next.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Just what it says on the tin. This is a fun, simple chess app that that offers a no frills chess experience. Pretty awesome for being free.
B004V2AWKG|2.0|Terribly slow and old fashioned. I really did not like it and struggled to get through it. The story is original and different to most things I read, it just was outdated. Sorry.<br /><br />Ages 18-99
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a pretty good time waster in general.  there are some really fun games.  I suggest it to people with time to kill.
0340881542|3.0|I really love this series, Class A has a strong reference to drugs throughout the story, although there is some good morals here, It's probably the worst Cherub book but a great book to read just the same.<br /><br />Age 12-15
B0040NOWY8|5.0|There are very few options for a 50gb bluray spindle, I think only verbatim and tdk are doing this, not sure why sony are out of this market.
B0060LYM34|5.0|I've waited a long time for this movie to come to Amazon Video on Demand and in November, 2011 it finally did.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I don't buy many movies on blu-ray, even less through Amazon Instant Video. But I am an Amazon Prime member, have a Kindle Fire, like Bruce Willis and am a Sci-Fi/Fantasy movie fan. So what makes a movie like this worth buying on Amazon Instant Video or on blu-ray? Several things: great story, excellent actors, great acting, amazing visuals, top-notch picture quality and sound (The blu-ray is rated at the GOLD LEVEL for picture quality by avsforum dot com).<br /><br />What makes this movie worth buying for $10 on Amazon Instant Video. Let's start with: Exploding oil rigs, asteroids flying through outer space, a space shuttle sling shotting around the moon, police chases, gambling casinos, a dramatic crash on an asteriod, an exploding space station, fiery asteroid fragments with smoking tails hitting the earth plus some gorgeous sunsets/skies/panoramas shots. And although the surface of the asteroid and even the Earth control center are semi-dark areas, the use of smoke and white, blue and green lighting to create atmosphere is perfect. Everything in this movie is about visual detail, color and sound. When you watch a movie like this, it's a delight to the eyes. Everything looks good and you find yourself almost wanting to watch it alone because you don't want to miss out on a single visual shot. Good re-watchability because there's so much to see you're bound to miss something.<br /><br />By the way, this movie also looks great on the Kindle Fire. Since the movie is not available for rent as of this post date, at least if you buy it you can download it to your device. Then you can watch it anywhere and as many times as you like on the Fire(or on your computer).
B0063IH60K|5.0|Awesome and fast paced! Minimum  commercials what more could you ask for in an app. As Joey Tribbini would say &quot;How YOU doin'?&quot;
B006ON41FC|5.0|Naughty but pure, shallow, and arcady fun. Looks good, fun little time waster. Well worth the. 99 if you ask me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Brilliance. I love this game. All of them. :) It's very creative and interesting. The games are pretty challenging. I hope they make another.
B0060Q962Q|4.0|This \\"Fantastic 4 in a Row\\" app is essentially the Hasbro [[ASIN:B00000IWI1 Connect Four]] game and plays exactly like the original. This is a strategy game that requires players to get four of their pieces in a row by dropping their color down the columns, while blocking the opponents attempts at the doing the same. The four in a row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. There is some strategy involved and the computer levels can be adjusted to Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expect, but plays a good game on the Medium setting.<br /><br />There are also three themes to choose from, including Standard (looks like the classic game), Christmas (using Christmas Tree Balls), and Sports (using Soccer and Basket Balls), each with different music and sound effects (both can be turned off).<br /><br />This installed and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO 4G.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Absolutely love the WHOLE entire CD. Can listen to it all the way through. Most definitely recommend it! her voice fits all ranges of emotions you can listen this when you are happy, sad, angry, or just chill. I am going to buy her other albums because of this one.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|Well, I love 80s music and hearing all the references to The Police, Peter Gabriel and other stand outs of decades past is incredibly fun for me.  Gotye has a fabulous voice and loads of talent, his songs are all so different but not in a way that gives you whiplash.  I can listen to this album from start to finish and then repeat it all again.  My fav tracks:  Easy Way Out, Eyes Wide Open, Smoke and Mirrors, Save Me, and of course Someone I Used to Know is still one of my favorites no matter how much I hear it.  The man is gifted.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Wow!  Never have I encountered a more fascinating puzzle game.  This is surely the best: And at $0.49, you can't refuse!  So, what are you waiting for?!!

B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is awesome for people of all ages especially if you want to challenge your self. i beloved that the app is perfect for people of all ages
0374275637|3.0|Frankly, I am baffled by the popularity of this book.  The content is ok, I suppose, but it reads a like college lecture presented by the worst professor on campus.  I took an Antitrust class in law school that I found far more interesting and exciting.  The author tediously outlines the methodology of several psychological studies and eventually reaches a mundane conclusion.  In response, I yawn and move on to the next point.  I have been reading it before bed because the droning nature of the book puts me to sleep every time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. I love how you can change the picture of the cards. yes there's an accasional ad but its the price to pay for a free game
0312641893|4.0|Cinder by Melissa Meyers is a unique retelling of the much-beloved classical tale of Cinderella. Now if that was all the story was about it wouldn't be getting four ravens from me!  When I think of Cinderella, I see a nasty uncaring step-mother, two ugly and equally unpleasant step sisters, the oh so handsome prince and a fairy godmother.  Well, you're getting all that with in my opinion some very cool twists.  There's not just her wicked step mother and step sister (only one is a b.... with a capital B) there is also an evil, and I mean EVIL Queen! I'm blown away by Meyers's novel. It has so much going for it. I love the Asian setting, the aliens or lunar race living on the moon, the virus that is ravaging the country, and mostly I love the cyborg elements.<br /><br />The storyline has a fast pace, even if I knew where it was ultimately heading. Cinder, in my opinion, is one cool chick! She's a mechanic, part cyborg and apparently can attract a prince with grease spots on her face.  Lucky she is... between a deadly plague, the truly evil plans her stepmother comes up with, and the possibility of the lunars attacking earth, there is a lot to keep our girl busy.  And of course there's the ball - I mean come on, it just wouldn't be Cinderella without the ball and Cinders struggles to get there.<br /><br />I think you know by now how much I loved the book, and I am having a hard time waiting for the next book to come out. I cannot wait to see where the story takes Cinder and what happens when you don't get your happily ever after...
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This app is awesome along with all the other teamlava apps. great buy. we r all so lucky its free. nothing wrong with it. not too easy and just the right amount of challenge. luv it!!
1451683405|5.0|This is a great book and fun to read. Sam has an awesome sense of humor. Although he seems to consider himself an atheist, I would love to have a conversation with him about what is running this whole show. I totally agree that \\"we\\" are not the author of our lives. But something appears to be - and don't give me this random selection survival of the fitness nonsense, because it is clearly not random and clearly something is happening. There seems to be a very precise intelligence designing and running things with some sort of agenda. As a former EMT, I noticed time and time again that people don't die until life or what-have-you is good and ready for them to die. People survive all sorts of horrible accidents for no good reason.  All sorts of things happen that medical science cannot and does not explain. The human body is incredibly designed to function for a fairly specific length of time and then it dies. Why? What cares? What is life? What is intelligence? Why do we have it to one degree or another?<br /><br />I recommend reading this book in one sitting with a very open attitude. It has the capacity to give you a genuine \\"kensho\\" experience. And if you are sincerely looking into this issue of free will, I also highly recommend From Here to Here: Turning Toward Enlightenment by Gary Crowley, and Enlightenment is Not What You Think by Wayne Liquorman.<br /><br />The paradoxical experience of deeply realizing you have no free will is one of profound freedom and oneness with all and everything.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|Search for the pattern. Once found u will got strike every try. I beat Doc at 300 points every time. I am addicted to this game. Best part is got it free from Amazon app store.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game with a big variety of things to do. Some games are easy but others it is try, try again unroll you get lucky orfigure out a strategy.
0399159029|4.0|If you've read any of the seven previous books in the Bernie Gunther series, you'll know that Gunther had some personal history with SS Reichsprotector Heydrich -- the architect of the \\"Final Solution\\" and regarded by many as the evilest of the many evil men who were responsible for the Holocaust. And if you know a bit about World War II, you'll know that Heydrich was killed in 1942 by Czech and Slovak soldiers trained by the British. This eighth installment in the Gunther series opens at Heydrich's funeral before rewinding nine months to September 1941, to find Gunther living a bleak existence as a suicidal homicide detective in Berlin.<br /><br />The first third of the book has him investigating the murder of a Dutch guest worker, and a possibly related attack on a bar girl -- then Heydrich shows up. Or rather, he invites Gunther to come to a castle outside Prague, and since even suicidal cops don't decline Heydrich's invitations, Gunther takes the train down to Prague with his new girlfriend in tow. That's when things really get weird, as Heydrich makes Gunther a job offer he can't refuse, and the plot suddenly turns into a funhouse version of a Golden Age mystery, complete with a locked room murder, house full of guests, and even a butler. The house is full of SS officers, one of whom has apparently murdered another, and somehow, he must find the killer. Haunted by the nightmares of his time in Belorussia, Gunther relishes his role as cat among pigeons, poking and prodding his way through the brass until he breaks the case. (Part of the conceit, which the reader just has to accept, is that Heydrich finds it useful to keep the obvious Nazi-hater Gunther around as a useful and provocative tool, rather than tossing him in jail or worse for holding unpatriotic views and expressing them so plainly.)<br /><br />The internal feuds of the various high-level Germans, and the secrets each conceals, make for interesting reading, but the juxtaposition of the Golden Age mystery style with the grim reality of the SS characters is what makes the book a true page-turning entertainment. The book's one weak link is Gunther's romantic entanglement, the outcome of which is spelled out all too obviously in the title. However, it's not enough of a flaw to derail the book, which does a great job of weaving together the historical reality of the real figures who populate the story with enough speculation to create a good story. And as it turns out, I didn't know as much about Heydrich's death as I thought I did, and the book sent me scurrying online to learn more.<br /><br />Readers who enjoy the Gunther books may also want to try a series by Ben Pastor featuring a Wehrmacht intelligence officer who sometimes gets assigned to look into murders that have political angles -- the first two are [[ASIN:1904738664 Lumen]] and [[ASIN:1904738826 Liar Moon]].ery style with the grim reality of the SS characters is what makes the book a true page-turning entertainment.

And as it turns out, I didn't know as much about Heydrich's death as I thought I did, and the book sent me scurrying online to learn more.<br /><br />Readers who enjoy the Gunther books may also want to try a series by Ben Pastor featuring a Wehrmacht intelligence officer who sometimes gets assigned to look into murders that have political angles -- the first two are [[ASIN:1904738664 Lumen]] and [[ASIN:1904738826 Liar Moon]].

1451648537|3.0|Those of us looking for a nice tribute book about Steve Jobs after his death will be sadly disappointed by this book.  It is well written and hard to put down, but it is written in the style of a hollywood \\"Tell All\\".  The first half of the book is nothing short of a character assassination.  It's as if the author wished to find anyone and everyone that has something negative to say about Steve Jobs, and then filled his book with their accounts.  Hardly what many of us were expecting so soon after Job's passing.<br /><br />This book reaches a larger audience by focusing less upon the products and technology, and more upon personalities.  Major events at Apple sometimes receive disappointingly little coverage.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it remains an interesting read.  There are a few new insights, and the author acknowledges that no one else in the world of art or technology could have done what Steve Jobs has done.  After all, even if you use a Windows computer, you are using a Mac knockoff ( a poor knockoff, but a knockoff).  The same applies if you use a non-Apple smart phone powered by Google  (iPhone knockoff).  Whether you realize it or not, your world has been positively impacted by Steve Jobs and his life's work.  It just would have been nice to read an account of such a life that wasn't so negative.

B006OV7RQ4|1.0|Don't believe a word of the hype over this movie by the high-minded critics!  It stinks!  From the getgo everything is awful.  Do we really need to be force-fed a disgusting, putrid repast on the dark side of life?  Talk about a hopeless, lifeless waste of time and money!  Why would someone with talent create something this ugly?
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I had never heard of Fun before I caught the end of \\"We Are Young\\" on the radio.  I downloaded that track and listened to it over and over before I decided to give the whole album a try.<br />I have to tell you, it's the best album I've listened to in a very long time.<br />The more I listen to it, the more I like it.<br />The music is fresh, catchy and feels full of hope.  It's like spring put to music, makes you feel alive again after a long hard winter.<br />I love the lyrics, I love the music, I love it all.<br />Different from what I normally listen to and delightfully wonderful!
1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris has done a impressing job writing on a very interesting subject. His arguments are compelling and his writing style is elegant and engaging.<br />I applaud his method of compressing his message into a short book, which makes it very accessible to readers that perhaps find the subject interesting, but might not want to dive into a full-length book.

B006M4RN3U|4.0|Band Fun., comprised of Nat Ruess (the frontman), Jack Antonoff, and Andrew Dost, deliver quite a treat with their 2012 LP entitled [[ASIN:B007B6VOG0 Some Nights]].  The sound of Fun. Can be described as an eclectic mix of classic pop/rock, indie pop, modern pop, and hip-hop (thank producer Jeff Bhasker for the latter!).  When comparing the sound of the band to counterparts, the band sounds like a mix of Queen, Mika, and Panic At The Disco.  Interesting about the Panic at the Disco reference, Some Nights is released on the same label as the band, Fueled by Ramen.  Some Nights ends up being one of 2012's crowning achievements, featuring no outright misses or any unnecessary cuts. What makes Some Nights all the better is that the addictive #1 hit \\"We Are Young,\\" featuring Janelle Mon&aacute;e isn't even the best cut.<br /><br />The effort opens with \\"Some Nights (intro)\\" which turns out to be more than an inconsequential interlude. The interlude foreshadows the quirkiness and eclecticism of the album, delivering soaring harmonized vocals, dramatic timpani patch, and overall a palette of the theatrical.  The directness and cleverness of the songwriting shines as well: \\"There are some nights I hold on to every not I wrote/some nights, I say `f--- it all' ad stare at the calendar...\\" \\"Some Nights,\\" the title track follows and does not disappoint. The cut opens with a cappella vocals filled with studio effects.  Eventually, piano enters in and accompanies, prior to pounding, African-styled drums delivering nothing short of an infectious groove. The background vocals continue to allure, harmonized in the highest capacity.  No need to leave out frontman Ruess, who sings his heart out just like a young Freddie Mercury.  The album definitely starts off on a high note.<br /><br />\\"We Are Young,\\" featuring Janelle Mon&aacute;e is unsurprisingly a #1 hit.  The drums continue to pound hard and frontman Nat Ruess's vocals soar as clearly as ever.  The songwriting is a selling point, particularly the catchy, easy-going refrain: \\"Tonight, we are young/so let's set the world on fire/we can burn brighter/than the sun...\\" The production work remains as alluring as ever.  \\"Carry On\\" doesn't miss a beat, opening with acoustic guitar couple with acoustic piano.  The ornate, complexity of the background vocals fails to let up, continuing to make Some Nights breathtaking.  Another well conceived chorus captivates (\\"If you're lost and alone/or you're sinking like a stone/carry on...\\") as does a compelling electric guitar solo around the 2:40 mark. \\"It Gets Better\\" features animated drum programming and a rich assortment of vocal effects.  The up-tempo feel is a selling point, as is the genre-bending nature of this particular cut (punk-pop-electro cut).  Five tracks in, Some Nights is five tracks strong.<br /><br />\\"Why Am I the Only One\\" gets it done, yielding more top-notch songwriting (\\"Go on, go on, go on/If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come...\\"). \\"All Alone\\" is buttressed down by hip-hop drum programming and characterized by electronic synths.  \\"All Alright\\" is a stand-out, notable once more for songwriting and production proficiency.  \\"One Foot\\" may be the biggest surprise, given its brassy production and unorthodox, creative sound. \\"Stars\\" is another fine cut, though its length compromises its grandeur a bit (it is almost seven minutes in duration).  Closing cut \\"Out on the Town\\" has a great four-on-the-floor beat holding it down, not to mention Ruess flaunting his lovely falsetto.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B007B6VOG0 Some Nights]] is a great album that transcends genre.  There are enough elements of so many styles that the audience for Some Nights is quite wide instead of narrow.  The duration is tight at only 46 minutes, and each track is distinct.  Highly recommended effort.rly the catchy, easy-going refrain: \\"Tonight, we are young/so let's set the world on fire/we can burn brighter/than the sun...\\" The production work remains as alluring as ever.  \\"Carry On\\" doesn't miss a beat, opening with acoustic guitar couple with acoustic piano.

It is SO poorly written (and believe me, I was not an english major but my 12 yr old writes better!)The author uses the same words over and over, it made me crazy! She used the word \\"Jeez\\" hundreds of times, at one point I counted it atleast once on every page! others were \\"inner goddess\\" \\"murmur\\" and \\"clamber\\". She also tried to use some 'big' vocabulary words that didnt even fit the sentence! My friends told me to get past that and read the story but it was just so dumb!!

0385344228|5.0|Fourteen year old Jacob Barber stands accused of killing his nemesis, there is no real proof, no eyewitness just hearsay, a thumbprint and a headstrong assistant district attorney  that is looking to make his bones in not only taking down this boy, but to also putting his father, Andy Barber a fellow assistant district attorney in his place.  What turns into a battle between two grown men soon takes a family beyond its emotional bounds and introduces their community and the courtroom to the \\"murder gene\\".<br /><br />Near the very end, there is a very subtle change, but one that had me rereading a particular sentence.  A sentence where an idolized wife was dismissed or demoted and I wondered if this was the intended purpose.  Where do a man's loyalties belong?  Where does blame and responsibility belong?<br /><br />This book has stayed with me longer than I thought it would have, after the mid book ramblings with a particular character that I still do not feel added enough insight to have had so much devoted to her, I keep going back to the end of the story.  To say that I did not see it coming would be an understatement.  Can I understand what happened?  Yes, as much as I can understand the actions of others.  Yes, as much as I can explain two trains running straight at each other and no one seems to be able to stop it.<br /><br />William Landay has included every part of a parent's human nature in this book.  How far would we go to protect our child?  Our community?  What truths, but more importantly, what lies are we willing to live with just so we can close our eyes at night.

B004LWZW8I|4.0|IMMORTALS is a comic book version of Greek Mythology - but then what film that deals with the mythical heroes isn't?  IMMORTALS just makes them bigger than life - which they are supposed to be. It also is a decent reminder that we all should brush up on Greek mythology for the lessons it holds, many of which remain relevant to today's modus operandi of oppression and domination when it comes to small countries, their inner conflicts, and the ravages imposed upon them by invaders. Written by Charles and Vlas Parlapanides and directed by Tarsem Singh Dhandwar who understands the use of CGI in making his story sail forth, IMMORTALS is in the final analysis entertainment - and who could ask for more.<br /><br />John Hurt opens the thought process of the film with some thoughts about immortality and divinity and that sets off the action about the Titans encased in Mount Tartaros, the Greek gods in Olympus and a tawdry, extraordinarily brutal King Hyperion who desires total control, a goal that can only be accomplished by seizing the Epirus Bow.  Among the humans is one Theseus, a swarthy lad devoted to his mother, who knows no fear and when it comes to battle he will do anything for those he loves. And the rest is a touch of love story between Theseus the and oracle Phaedra, some good buddy relationship with Stavros, and a lot of fighting and mesmerizing corporeal dismemberment all in the name of battle. In the end it is up to Theseus to save his people from Hyperion and his hordes and win the honor of the gods, gaining immortality as a legend.<br /><br />The cast is surprisingly good - Henry Cavill proves he can carry off a lead heroic character, and Mickey Rourke manages to create on of his best roles as the insane King Hyperion -  but the main ingredient in this film is the quality of eye candy from Freida Pinto to the collection of Adonis-like bared torsos of the likes of the very buff Cavill, Stephen Dorff, Luke Evans, Joseph Morgan, Kellan Lutz, Corey Sevier, Daniel Sharman, Steve Byers...it is a runway walk of perfect physiques. Taken for what it is - a spectacle of mythological proportions, it works!  Grady Harp, March 12l Sharman, Steve Byers...it is a runway walk of perfect physiques.

B001EO748M|4.0|\\"The Tudors\\" continues its sumptuous examination of the oversized reign of young Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys Meyers).  While the first season saw a lot of minor-league politicking and bedchambering, Season Two is where this series grows up.<br /><br />King Henry continues to jockey for the right to marry the enchanting Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer).  The increasingly brazen king is opposed both by the continental monarchs of Europe who are beholden to the Pope (a fantastic Peter O'Toole) and the Catholic Church as well as several of his own subjects who are appalled both by the abandonment of the church as well as Harry's treatment of Queen Catherine of Aragon (Maria Doyle Kennedy).  Sir Thomas More (Jeremy Notham), Harry's one-time friend and counselor, struggles to walk the fine line of neither supporting nor condemning the King.  This task grows ever more difficult as Henry, egged on by ambitious aides and advisors, imposes strict loyalty oaths and other manipulations worthy of a police state.<br /><br />The wheels of power chew up and spit out a healthy portion of the cast in Season Two - everyone is playing for high stakes.  We all know people who say \\"history is boring,\\" in large part because history, when taught poorly, is often told as a succession of inevitable events.  Here, we know that Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn is destined to rule one day as Elizabeth I.  However, Season Two demonstrates just how precarious her position was as there are many powerful players who want her dead.  Season Two does a fine job of keeping the drama flying so quickly that we often forget that we know the fate of so many of the actors.<br /><br />And the acting is fine here across the board - Notham, Kennedy, and Dormer each take turns stealing entire episodes.  But the show is first and foremost anchored by JRM, who's performance has been controversial.  I am a fan - he combines the peevy entitlement of a young man who is given a kingdom as a plaything with the righteous majesty of a monarch who will not be denied.  Much of the criticism levied at JRM seems to be more correctly aimed at the character of young Harry, who by any account is a spoiled man.<br /><br />There is plenty of bedchambering in Season Two even if it does not hit the heights of the first season - but this is a movie to be enjoyed for its romance as well as for its political intrigue.<br /><br />If you're interested in the series, start with the first season and work to here - you'll be glad you did.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First time reviewer and truly inspired to spread the greatness that I have just consumed in a few short days.  What an amazing read! Wool is sure to be a classic!  Hugh has created such a masterful dystopian world, and we have only just seen the tip of the silo. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, sci-fi fan or not.  You will be sucked in...and all 5 books in the Wool Omnibus for $4.99 is a steal.  Hugh also is an author that cares for the fans, keeps them updated and regularly posts on his website (hughhowey.com) and responds in his forums.  Be sure to check it out.  I am a new fan of Hugh's...only just starting Wool a few days ago, but I can say, without a doubt, he is my new favorite author from this reading alone.  I am anxious to see more about the Siloverse, but am glad I can come up for air, if only for just a short time. I just downloaded the remainder of his yarns onto the Kindle! I hear more great things a calling.

All the stories in this version (and future ones as well) are amazing, I have since continued on to other stories featuring Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson.Reading this book was a pleasure.
1451627289|5.0|As someone who still remembers what life in the 1950s was like, who can say exactly what he was doing when he heard the news that President Kennedy had been shot, and who devoured tons of books about the various theories regarding the assassination in the years that followed, I couldn't resist this book and found it to be a great read.  I have enjoyed a number of Stephen King books in the past but in my opinion this is his best work.  The book has some very interesting ideas about the paradoxes of going back in time, a lot of fascinating research about Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy assassination, a strong romantic interest, and a moving portrait of life in the 1950s, with both its good and bad sides. It's a big book and not easy to put down, so be prepared for some long nights!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|First saw this in the theaters and was blown away by the effects and cinematography but it isn't just all show. While the story-line isn't the greatest, I thought it moved along at a nice pace while leaving open a lot of things for audience interpretation. I did find the Spock-Uhura relationship a bit odd and out of place. Chris Pine did a great job as Kirk, nobody expects him to replace anyone but he did a fine job. Karl Urban as Bones stole the movie and every scene he was in.

My hats off to GRRM as a writer and creative mind.<br /><br />Now I am regretting being hooked because:<br /><br />1. With the last couple books the plot has slowed WAY down. Too many new characters, new plot lines, and a meandering plot have gotten me frustrated. I feel we are going nowhere.

A few of these explain key elements of the plot (Cersei and Jaime for example) but the many cheapen the plot rather than enhance.

0439023513|3.0|The Mockingjay, the last, and worst, book in the Hunger Games series struggles to keep the reader engaged in the activity. There is so little here to like, so little action, and a surprisingly easy battle against the Capitol.<br /><br />That is where the book finds itself so offbase. This is a Capitol that held people under their iron thumb, who created the tracker jackers, the Jabberjay, and other muttations; who face districts without any of these things, and mostly without weapons. Yet, there is victory after victory. Or so we are told, because Katniss, our heroine, plays such a small role in the fight that we hear, rather than see wins.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting her to lead the charge (she is only 17) to victory over the hated Capitol, but in this book, her role is reduced to whining and pining over Peeta. There really was never much of a love triangle in the series, so the one she chooses between Peeta and Gale is never a surprise. But, IMO, what is really missing in the book, is Peeta himself. Yes, he is certainly in the book, and is changed, but what the book needed was the old Peeta, who balanced out the EMOness (if there is such a word) of Katniss. That loss dramatically downgraded the final output.<br /><br />Still, on the whole the series was a winner. Katniss, may have been a reluctant hero, but she is a hero nonetheless. In her we saw her many weaknesses, but also her great strength, including the ability to do what needed to be done. I will miss reading about more of her adventures.
B004ZNAXX2|3.0|I must start with the fact that I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd, and already have every scrap of material that I can own from them.  So why purchase this? For me it was to be a completist. I have the other two new immersion box sets, so I have to get this.  If you are not like me, and just want what is absolutely new (the two demo discs), then the experience 4 disc version would do just fine for you, and save you a lot of cash.  The contents of 4 of the discs are previously release (the wall album and is there anybody out there live cd's), but remixed. The remixing is really not that special for me.  The 2 demo discs were the must haves for me, and they are pretty cool to hear what was going on through the evolution of this album.  The dvd was not that great, has a documentary on the movie that was previously released on 20th anniversary wall dvd and concert films, but not worth extra cash from casual listeners.  The packaging is good, artwork excellent, and coasters, marbles, and scarf neat also.  This would have been the be-all, end all box set and gotten 5 Stars from me had they just took the time and put a blu ray version of The Wall film in here or a live recording of the wall performance with the original members from that time period, or best if both.  Overall, get the experience edition unless you get the good deal I did and have the shelf space and extra cash to purchase this.

159102594X|4.0|I read a number of very positive reviews on this book (not all Amazon), so I decided it perhaps had risen to the level of deserving my attention.  Because... you know... such is like being touched by the finger of God.<br /><br />Could I give it five stars the Dugong asks me (my favorite marine mammal for obvious reasons).  Nope... I just couldn't go five on this.  I'll put a big `ol four on the table, but I can't do five.<br /><br />Here's why - the book just doesn't go anywhere... it is really just a setup for the next book.  Will the cumulative review of all three be worthy of a coveted MoonDonkey five star ranking?  Maybe, but I'm not there yet.<br /><br />I also think that there were instanced where some more description could have been used.  For example, I'm still not entirely sure what a Shanka is supposed to look like.<br /><br />Finally, the author does tend to make little \\"jumps\\" in the plot.  One minute you're in the action, the next you are hearing about how it concluded after the fact.  It's like waking up with a hangover, next to a girl, and getting the story second hand (which still happens to me at least a couple times a week).<br /><br />I'll say this - the ending of the book was really pretty good... the last 10% or so.  The part when Logen goes into Bloody-Nine mode is great.  One minute I'm sitting there on my red satin sheets minding my own business and reading like a normal person.  Then out of nowhere the Bloody-Nine stuff starts.  I'm like, \\"What's going on????\\"  Then I'm like, \\"What's going on!?\\"  Then I'm like \\"Ahhhh!  What's going on!!!!  Ahhhhh what's going on!!!!  Duuuuuuuuuuuuudddddde!!!!!!\\"<br /><br />Yeah... that's pretty much how it went down.  I have the stains to prove it.<br /><br />I was thinking three stars until the end, then it pretty clearly got bumped to four.<br /><br />One note - I saw a number of reviewers comparing this series to the works of George RR Martin.  I can't say I get that comparison.  The accurate comparisonis George RR Martin to Robert Jordan.  Neither one can finish a series.  That's why I'm reading this one - it actually has a conclusion and I don't have to spend the next 20 years catching up as new books come out.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app that does what it says. use it on my kindle and my Pc.<br />would recommend to everybody. only gripe is the interface on the kindle could be better.
0679731725|5.0|I just wanted to point out that - while the summary might strike you as boring and solemn - Stevens is actually funny in his own way (although he does not intend to be). For example, there is a scene where he gets caught reading a romance novel in secret. Undignified, he projects his embarrassment through anger. There are many other parts where you will see that the book is in fact very enjoyable.<br />The farcical scences illustrate Stevens' inability to realize his own emotions. However, the narrative is so convincing that, despite the story's unfamiliar background and Stevens' idiosyncratic character, I was entirely pulled into the story. The post-WWI English ambience, filled with doubt and distrust, has caused the main character to blindly serve his master, inhibit his own emotions, and thereby deny them. I was somehow able to empathize his lonley position as a bulter. This is indeed a beautiful memoir. Glad I picked it up.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've been using this app for a couple of weeks now and have no complaints at all.  I've been comparing it to weather underground and this has been more accurate.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Movie arrived in slip cover and plastic wrapped, quick service, great quality, could check on delivery information. It is for a little older child that my three year old granddaughter.
B005N0PJJO|3.0|I could not enjoy this book because every time Ana would say something to Christian, I wanted to throw something at her. Why did the author make her sound so whiny and insecure? Take for example the case with Leila. Christian was right that as a human being, he had to care for Leila. And yet there was Ana, who just couldn't suppress her jealousy long enough to listen to Christian when he says that this isn't about her. She's gotta be one of the most self-absorbed, supposed protagonist that I have ever come across.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|I really did like the sequel, but I agree with some of the other reviewers in the opinion that this book was a bit too long. I feel like this book could have been shortened a lot and stil had the same story. It was still good though.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|After spending tons of money just to buy gems to build my restaurant they app is no longer working and closes automatically so I can no longer play. Don't waste your money. this game is a rip off.
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|I appreciate the lyrical sentiment of this record. I am happy that someone is speaking out passionately for what they believe and I think that Springsteen still believes in the power of music to change the world. That said, I don't believe this music has the power necessary to accomplish that change. The melodies and harmonies are all too simple, repetitive, and derivative of past Springsteen songs. To my ears, this \\"experimental\\" record is not nearly as innovative as \\"Born to Run.\\" When artists fail to learn any new tricks, they risk becoming self parodies and that is, sorry to say, what this record brings to mind.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I love the L Word and when I saw that we can get it this cheap we jumped on it. I love the packaging and it'll fit nice on the bookcase with the rest of the movies we own. Very excited to watch it for the 4th time!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Played this a few months ago at a friends house. My g/f really liked this game. Went here to get it. Costs an extra 10 bucks to the price at the local store. Worth the wait. I enjoyed playing it. Takes about an hour to get through it.

B005K17RU0|4.0|like the way you can view right now and the near future but can easily view long range forecasts too.
B004I744AS|5.0|I would be careful with this app if you are easily distracted. I can personally spend hours reading all the information in this app.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is fun and entertaining for people of all ages. it teaches children and adults alike good hand eye coordination
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I sincerely loved this book. It was true and real. This books takes you into the world of the characters. A need to read!

1400069289|1.0|Mostly a series of anecdotes. Certainly not a self help book.<br />Mostly  well known marketing advice, if I could return my kindle copy I would.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Love love love this cd. She does have a Bonnie Raitt sound which I love but adds her own skilful sounds with a touch of blues..... Awesome! Derick Trucks is amazing as well..they deserved the grammy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a pleasant little app. Easy to use, fun to play, works well on my Fire. An ad pops up as each hand is dealt, but I don't find it bothersome. It's a free app, after all, and delivers very well for the price! Thank you for a great little way to pass the time.
B000TEMRXA|4.0|This will take you back to high school and college. Great songs and vocals. If you can get it at a good price, buy it.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|I rented this, and didn't buy it from Amazon.  White Collar is not your typical procedural cop show.  The fact that one person who helps solve the crimes is a white collar criminal is definitely different, and leads to interesting tension at times.  The interplay between the FBI agent Peter, the criminal Neal, and various other characters is interesting, as is the growth you see in the characters over the course of the season.  It's a good, fun show.
B005KXU83G|4.0|This is a good as I remember it in high school. Soulful and just great. It is a very good low cost rendition of Bob Seger. Recorded live at different venues.
B005HEVY54|3.0|Oh Seska, How Evil you are.  And that's about the meat of this chapter.  It's about the other side of the Prime Directive. And how much it can sting.  A noble effort, but I was playing pinball on another screen half the time.  Not bad, but not the greatest episode of Voyager.  3.4/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Just got my copy today and listening away as I write. Amazon makes it easier now to get the releases on the first day. Beats gassin' up the jalopy and heading over to the \\"record store\\"  - RECORD STORE! What's a record store! Yeah, I'm one of those oldies and I live in Florida now been a fan since college and the first time I heard Kitty's Back on KSHE radio in St. Louis!<br /><br />Now we go to our mailbox, throw it on the latest contraption and there's Bruce...whoppin' it up again.<br /><br />This batch is much better than the most recent batches...\\"Dream\\"... \\"Diamonds and Dust\\" ...\\"Magic\\" now that was dreck! Doesn't this kind of remind you of \\"Rising\\" with a different theme? GREAT ALBUM? nah...that happened years ago....let me ask you...what will you do in your 60's that is so new and inspiring that family, friends and love ones will just be simply amazed? Hell 2 guys in the band have passed. Think if it was Bruce. There'd be nothing to write about except memories. Always make me wonder, what we would have heard from Lennon later in his life. hmmmm?<br /><br />Bruce fans...time to celebrate! Rejoice....Grab your favorite beverage....Crank it up...and well...SMILE...There are some real fun songs here ...some sad...some flag wavers....all in all it's all Bruce baby!<br /><br />BTW: kinda cool to have \\"LOHAD\\" with the Big Man wailin' away.<br /><br />Thanks Bruce....see you in Tampa for the 24th time later this month.
B005HEWK1Q|4.0|This episode is a Voyager highlight, not because it's great sci-fi, but because it actually ties to later episodes in the series.  It also has a lot of scenes for a 45 minute show.  Cons: I think the Kazon are one of the more inferior species Voyager has to face.  The acting wasn't really on par either.  But I must give it due for everything else.  3.9/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'
B005HG4C4C|5.0|i only listened to this album about three times so far and it sounds amazing!<br />gone is the unappealing thrashing and the annoying angry rap parts witn portnoy, the drums are not as loud and the drum sound is overall much more round and pleasant.<br />there is a lot less of pointless instrumental circlejerk and the band concentrates on making sound song concepts. i like the electronic beats, the tuvan throatsinging<br />and the fact, that they finally have softer songs with very cool guitarwork and solos that will not only appeal to musicians.<br /><br />these are all very pleasant changes. i think having portnoy gone ist the best thing that could happen for them musically.<br />first dream theater album i've liked in a long while.
B005HEW8S6|3.0|Young Ensign Kim is in trouble again.  The writers seem to give him the most to make a fuss about.  This is a Holodeck malfunction episode.  Yes, another one, as if we didn't know how much the holodecks can screw up.  (I don't know why they don't deactivate them during a new science mission).  Pro: The Doctor.  Cons: SLOW, and definitely a \\"filler\\" episode that can be skipped.  3.3/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it is really good. easy to use. many planes to choose.  fancy widged. like it. thank god, pray for it.

B004PR71JC|5.0|LOVED IT!!!  Every single song in this CD is great and best of all its music an adult can enjoy as well.
B0044KU7KU|3.0|I love MCR and always will.  I bought this album because it was the follow up to The Black Parade (which I loved).  I loved the lead single NaNaNa.....and there are a few songs that are great.....but no where near as good a the previous album.  MCR said they basically threw a whole album out and ended up with this.  Wondering if they made a mistake.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The best game I have purchased for my Kindle Fire so far. Definitely worth the 99 cents. Buy this game.
B0060Q962Q|4.0|Its the classical connect-4-discs game, simple but fun. The game offers 4 difficulty levels that allows you to play with a friend or against computer.<br />I specially like the 2 unique theme. Too bad it only has two...will give 5 stars if they made more lol
B006OCM0G0|4.0|i love this game i cant stop playing  it. its good for the kids and when u have nothing else to do it fun. i cant complain
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All of the movies are in one sleeve, which makes the case pretty small considering it includes 8 movies. It is a great space saver and cheaper than buying them individually.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is very simple but the updating challenges keep it interesting and challenge you after a point. really fun and simple game :)
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app! its kind of repetitive, but its a great time waster! and the best part is its free!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|After what I thought to be some disappointing albums the last few years, Bruce has released his best since The Rising. The music is a rousing blend of musical styles that works to keep the listeners' interest throughout. This is Bruce doing what Bruce does best .. raising awareness on social issues with a rocking backbeat that pays homage to the roots of rock. Will it play well in concert? You bet! And really, is there anything wrong with that?<br />I think it is important to note that there is a definite political position being presented here and I think that some folks who don't agree may have decided that this may not be a good offering. Personally this is quickly becoming one of my favorites so buy and enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just got this app for my kindle. it works really well, movement of the cards is great. I like how u have the option of a winning deal or random deal.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|Very excellent app, kindle fire friendly. works as advertised. love it!! ten stars would describe this app. night screen is very nice. this app is a must have.

B0063IH60K|4.0|good game with plenty of options for games. and choices of backgrounds and and backs for the deck of cards.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Even though I 5-starred DELIRIUM, I only just liked it a lot (though in my review, I stated I loved it - I did, but comparatively speaking, I only liked it). But I recognized it as the building block to something really, REALLY GREAT. It was still fantastic and Lauren Oliver's world was a captivating one, because what is more interesting than than a world without love?<br />PANDEMONIUM is an \\"OMG-I-couldn't-put-it-down-to-eat-or-sleep\\" kind of book. It picks up right where DELIRIUM leaves off, after Lena has crossed over the fence and lost Alex to the guards. So it begins at a fast-paced, somewhat delirious pace...<br />A lot happens in this novel. If you're hoping for a lot of Alex appearances, sorry for your luck because PANDEMONIUM isn't about Lena and Alex; PANDEMONIUM is about Lena and how she changes from Lena Holloway of Portland, Maine to Lena of the Wilds who is tough and a survivor. Her character growth throughout the story is nothing short of astounding and Oliver brings her from a somewhat weak girl to an independent woman capable of more than she ever thought possible.<br />Oliver is also a master of the details: Lena's description of New York City is vivid and descriptive, detailing a drab city devoid of color or any interesting life, as if the cure for deliria nervosa also turned off all the lights, and dulled the paint and vivacity of the Big Apple.  NYC has become indifferent.  She also perfectly describes the mass hordes of people during events, crowds so thick that even reading about them in the pages made my heart constrict in a slight panic because I'm somewhat claustrophobic. Somehow, I think Lauren Oliver was drawing the reader in just that way.<br />I loved how Oliver has contradictions in PANDEMONIUM, like when Raven tells Lena she doesn't get to choose how she helps, when the whole point of being outside the walls IS the freedom of choice. The irony of these little episodes was not lost on me. Sometimes it was as if Lena had never left Portland.<br />Speaking of Raven, I really enjoyed all the new relationships and characters that were introduced in PANDEMONIUM. Each new character brings something different to the table, and makes Lena's story so much more unique and yet still made Lena stronger by herself.<br />So PANDEMONIUM is Lena's story to tell and she has one. I can't say I was surprised by the ending; I expected exactly that, but it was how I would have done it. If you have read DELIRIUM and you loved it, then run out and get PANDEMONIUM the minute you can! Even if you didn't love the first one, I think you'll still really like the second because it is fast-paced, full of action and - love.land.<br />Speaking of Raven, I really enjoyed all the new relationships and characters that were introduced in PANDEMONIUM.

B005ILYWN2|4.0|I was surprised by this movie.  I am so sick of Hollywood remaking older movies and not having an original thought.  This movie is the complete opposite.  An original idea, great story, scenery and suspense.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|**This is a 3 1/2 star review**<br /><br />Crossed is the second in the Matched series by Ally Condie. In Crossed, Cassia has been taken to a camp, where she labors each day for the Society and secretly plots a way to find Ky. She's no longer the girl excited for her Matched Ceremony, just another sheep in the herd; she's determined to find him, at almost any cost.<br /><br />I really liked Matched a lot, even though it has less action than most other books in the dystopian genre. There is a particular sinister undercurrent to the Society that I enjoyed immensely. Crossed didn't have as much of that, because hey, you already know they're sinister so the cat's out of the bag, right? Crossed becomes about Cassia trying to reach Ky, wherever he is, and also trying to leave the Society. There is no Pleasantville-esque landscape; the world around her is rough and tumble, barren and dry. But what I found really scary is not only what the Society controlled within their walls, but what they controlled outside as well. Just how far are they willing to go to control their people? You'll have to read to find out, but it's kind of crazy.<br /><br />Cassia and Ky have been sent to camps where bombs are dropped by the \\"Enemy\\" nightly and they have to act like decoy villagers. I have a feeling there is no Enemy; these are all anomalies and abberations, the Society doesn't care about them!<br /><br />Ally Condie builds on her characters throughout Crossed. Cassia is much stronger than she was in Matched, but she also doesn't feel so front and center either. A lot of that has to do with the dual-perspective, because Crossed is written in first-person, from both Cassia AND Ky's point of view. I've never been a fan of that, although it was done pretty elegantly in Crossed. I still had a hard time figuring out whose chapter it was though, because I would miss their name at the beginning of it and have to flip back. But I digress. As I was saying, before I so rudely interrupted myself with my own tangent, Cassia grows as a character throughout Crossed and I enjoyed that. Gone is the little sheep who believes whatever anyone tells her and in place of that is a strong woman, willing to fight for what she believes in.<br />We really get to know Ky in Crossed in a way we never did in Matched. He is such a deep character, much deeper than originally portrayed and he has been faced with such tragedy...we finally get to know his story. I really like him.<br />Xander is SUCH a surprise. I really love Xander. For the second time ever, I have no idea who I want a character to end up with in a love triangle - Ky or Xander? Who do you think it should be?<br />Condie gives us other characters that are also very fascinating: Vick and Indie were my two favorites. Vick was a hard character to \\"read\\" but in the end, I understood him very well. Indie was also very hard to \\"read\\" and seemed as though she had her own agenda.  I had a hard time figuring out if she had ulterior motives or if she was genuine.  I went back and forth on her very often. Condie details them both richly.<br /><br />So yes, while Crossed wasn't as good as Matched, it is still quite entertaining. I'm really hoping for a lot of action in the last book, especially considering where Crossed takes us. I had a hard time putting it down and I definitely recommend it to any fan of Matched or the dystopian genre.with my own tangent, Cassia grows as a character throughout Crossed and I enjoyed that.

B005HEW714|4.0|B'Elana is split in 2!  It's a memorable episode from season 1, and good character development for the Klingon. Cons: It was predictable, and slow at the end. But worth watching.  4.0/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'
0439023513|3.0|For starters, don't let my three-star review throw you. Anyone who has read the first two books and made it this far needs to read the third book regardless simply to know the end of the journey they've embarked on.<br /><br />That said, I did not like the journey through this third book nearly as much as I liked the first two. The first two drag you along headfirst with no choice. This one was interesting, sure, but it's simply not as fast-paced and doesn't hold your interest in the same way. I am, however, glad I read it, and it's not as if this book makes me think less of Collins as an author; I just wish there had been a way to wrap up the trilogy with a more captivating read, and I feel it probably could have been accomplished. Mockingjay has a totally different feel from the first two books as those are non-stop breathless action, and this one is a lot of political strategies, Katniss' thoughts, tragedy, etc. all slowly leading up to a decent end.<br /><br />Without this acting as a spoiler, I can tell you the ending is NOT some typical happy Hollywood ending. But I liked it. It suited the stories. And it's not altogether disappointing, \\"all is lost,\\" etc. - but it's not perfectly happy either. To HAVE some perfect happy-go-lucky ending would have been a cop-out given the subject matter of the trilogy.<br /><br />And on the love story front, I agree with Katniss' choice. It made sense and felt appropriate as done.<br /><br />So don't get me wrong with my three-star rating. I laughed, I cried, I loved the books as a trilogy. I just want readers to know not to expect the same rip-roaring thrill ride with this book that they got out of the first two books.
B005HEWC1Y|4.0|Space, The Final Frontier.  Only this is done Voyager style, and I loved it.  This episode is packed with great science fiction.  It's a classic story of an encounter like no other.  Worth watching if you like Trek.  I give it a healthy 3.9/5 Stars.  Cons: Not that memorable, no tie-ins, and not much character development. Also it is where Janeway first starts her holo-novel. ~Keep On Trekkin'
B005974CNA|4.0|The abandonment of the direction starting with Train of Thought is a welcome one. Though one might argue that Six Degrees was a turning point, I would argue instead that it was experimental. It was still epic, still struggled to express the kind of existential poetry that the guys are fond of writing, but even that was discarded starting with Train of Thought. ADTE is an amazing amalgamation of IAW, Awake, SFAM and Octavarium. Moreover, and with some nervousness from the potential backlash, I would argue that the album is a renovation of everything that Octavarium was trying to be. I still think album was a natural step in the right evolutionary direction that suffered from too many conceptually damaging (and disappointing) mutations, but this review is not about the past. \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" has officially made me excited about DT again for the first time since SFAM.<br /><br />I won't bore the readers with notes on specifics concerning the songs on ADTE that connect back to the various albums in the past. Rather, it is enough for me to hear and to recount the feeling that I got from listening to those albums in every song on ADTE. It's there and though it may not capture the monolithic wall of sound in IAW, nor all the epic-ness and nuance plugged into Awake, I would argue that those two albums put the foundation under ADTE. The references to SFAM and Octavarium are the most obvious in terms of melody, atmosphere and, i don't know, something regarding the \\"cleanliness\\" of many of the tracks. A few are muddy, like \\"On the Backs of Angels\\" - I thought it got a little too close to ATOT, personally. I didn't hate \\"Build me up, Break me Down\\" as much as others. I appreciated the electronics, even, but even still, I almost always skip these and start with \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\" because it has that conspiratorial undertone from SFAM and the manic accompaniment that made that album what it was. They do new things with it as well that remind me of Awake, especially around half-way through, and even, at the risk of ruining for everyone, some Falling Into Infinity influence as well. Not a single though - and this is a good thing.<br /><br />The next four make the album for me. I think \\"Outcry\\" is the lynchpin in the album as I think its singularity around which everything else orbits (and not just because it's positioned in the middle of the album...). Around the five-minute mark, you'll hear something resembling the opening riff to \\"Home\\" from SFAM. It is short, but when I heard on the first play through I had the thought that this is the song that built this album. I may be wrong (I've not read or watched or listened to any interviews), but the other songs both before and after \\"Outcry\\" seem to find their center go into and coming out of it. Many things have been said about \\"Breaking All Illusions\\" and I won't say much here since I risk just singing with the choir, but there is this one thing.... It is the \\"Learning to Live\\" of this album. It is not as epic; it is not as exciting; it IS uniquely qualified to be placed in the bevy of endgame songs that dot the early landscape of DT albums: \\"LtL\\", \\"Scarred\\", \\"One Last Time\\", \\"Trial of Tears\\" and so on. The only song that I simply cannot get into is \\"Beneath the Surface\\". The tone of the melody and James' voice are too fuzzy, too warm, too sappy, too \\"I Walk Beside You\\" for the lyrical content. I know they like to do that - \\"Anna Lee\\" and \\"Peruvian Skies\\" come to mind - but it falls flat for me in this case.<br /><br />Overall, it's an amazing rejuvenation of DT classic attention to melody, detail and arrangement. I haven't looked forward to a continuation of a new direction since Six Degrees. I'm now cautiously optimistic about where the guys go without Portnoy's angst and weird lyrical influence flooding the collective conscience of the group as a whole, as it obviously has since ToT. Wish you well Mike, you were the spirit and the thunder, but perhaps you needed to go so this project could get a much needed Dramatic Breath of Fresh Air.
B006XOBFB0|5.0|I have always liked Sony's recordings of Murray Perahia.  The 20bit ones were excellent.  This new set just takes these recordings to a new level (24bit).  The remastering is excellent which I expect from Sony's European division. The sound is clear, full and not harsh at all. To get this quality at this price is a steal.  If one likes Mzart Piano Concertoes get this box set.

However, just watching in on TV wasn't enough, I had to have the season to watch over and over again.  If you like fun \\"who-done-it's\\", you'll love this one!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I may be a bit biased at the Kennedy subject and that, along with the name of the author made me buy this book as soon as it became available.  I was plainly wrong.  This book is not about Kennedy; but my god what a plot!  I recommend it to everybody. A real page turner!
B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle is a fun police/crime show.  Castle is not a policeman but he is permitted to help solve crimes, because he is a mystery writer.  There is a fun relationship between the two main actors.  Castle has an awesome sense of humor.  There are also times that it is real serious, but it is one that you don't want to miss a minute of!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|For those of you who hate long reviews, I will sum this up in one sentence: if you liked Seeger Sessions and can imagine what it would be like to mix the old E-Street Band sound with this as rousing anthemic sing-alongs, then this one is for you. If you long for the Jersey rocker from the seventies who has musically moved light years above simple tastes, then move on, buddy! As a fellow artist, I can understand how Bruce is constantly in competition with himself to keep his material at a level that passes his own strict qualifications. The day that an artist has to worry about what the non-creative fan base thinks, then that is time to hang it up. (Notice that I have always refused to call him \\"Boss\\", since I was raised in New Orleans and never understood the nickname, even after visiting Jersey extensively).<br /><br />Most of these songs are rousing sing-alongs, but the lyrics are often quite depressing. Not many artists can pull this off, adding positive music to mostly negative lyrics (major key music to minor key lyrics). The only ones that I know of that have pulled this off with success are the calypsonians from Trinidad and the Irish folk musicians. Basically, the happy upbeat music was their inspiration to get out of their doldrums lifestyle, and it worked. When you are that down and out, the last thing that you want to hear is delta blues, although that was a quiet rebellion with a very different approach.<br /><br />To give you an idea for my taste with Bruce's music. I met and spoke with him personally shortly after the Born To Run album was released. I also liked the follow-up, Darkness On The Edge Of Town. However, when he released The River, I was out of there and did not even pay attention until he played the New Orleans' Jazz Fest 2006 with The Seeeger Sessions Band. I jumped back on the band wagon at that point, liking the follow-up Magic and filling in my one desired studio missing piece of The Rising. I had high anticipations for Working On A Dream, but hated a lot of it. Like many others, I thought that he was all washed up at that point, until this one was released. All I can say is that he must have told himself that if this were to be his last record, \\"Then let it be my best\\". His heart and soul shows on this one!!!<br /><br />As for all of you Jersey rockers who are bad mouthing this one, what do you want him to do? He is 62 years old, so do you want him to sing a remake from the seventies about his old street-rod racing buddies who hung out at the 7-11, and update it for 2012 when they are all over 50? It would be like who is going to take turns driving each other home from another colonoscopy and calling the \\"new\\" song \\"Darkness On The Edge Of My Gown\\" (hospital gown, that is). Or how would you like him doing one called \\"Prancing In The Park\\"? I will leave the subject matter of that one to your imagination!!! Dudes, grow up! Bruce has expanded his musical horizons, and so should you! By the way, that was not a rap-bit, but a very well done hip-hop section followed by gospel. Only Bruce could pull that one off!!!<br /><br />Move over Adele (but I still love your music), there will be a new chart topper in town, and he is not about to back down for a while!am, but hated a lot of it. Like many others, I thought that he was all washed up at that point, until this one was released.

159102594X|1.0|I'm not a fantasy fan, but I was looking for something to satisfy my Game of Thrones itch with this series.  Bad move.  I knew I was in trouble during the scene where they're playing poker (or whatever it's called in this world).  Instead of actually working on creating his characters, Abercrombie just tells us what each of them are about rather than actually doing anything to make the reader believe it.  Don't they still tell authors to show, not tell?<br /><br />I guess George Martin could've saved a lot of time by simply setting a card game at Winterfell in the first chapter of Game of Thrones.  \\"By the look on his face as he stared at his cards, Ned could tell that Tyrion was resentful of being looked down on because of his stature, was determined to overcome it by exercising his intellect, hated his father, had a doomed love affair, and was the most sympathetic of the Lannisters.  Oh, and by the way Jaime and Cersei sat next to each other, it seemed clear they were having sex.\\"  That way you don't have to waste pages and pages on dialogue, action, or plot and character development.<br /><br />And I'm sorry to be nitpicky, but in Standard English, isn't \\"all right\\" preferred over \\"alright?\\"  I find stuff like that distracting in a printed novel.  But that's on the editor, not so much the writer.
0439023513|1.0|First of all, I LOVED the first book. The second book I thought was good - not great.<br /><br />I started reading the 3rd book immediately after finishing the 2nd book.<br /><br />Honestly, I was so bored out of my mind that I started skipping bits.<br /><br />Most of the time Katniss is either: drugged up, in hospital, crying in a corner, or being told what to do. She loses all of her personality, and I really came to dislike her. in the end she was nothing more than a complete psychopath.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me reading was to find out whether she hooked up with Peeta or Gale. And I was utterly disappointed on that front too! It is added at the end of the book, like an afterthought, as if the author wanted to finish the book as soon as possible.<br /><br />I am so repelled by this book, so disappointed, and sad about it. Nothing in it was original. It was bombs, and death left right and center. I felt no emotion for any of the characters, and didn't care who died. The book was hollow, empty. It had no soul.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't even think there needed to be a second or third book. Collins could have fit the entire story into one 500 page novel if she took out most of the useless drivel. Useless things like; being pretty, having your makeup done, different foods, acting for the camera.<br /><br />This whole novel was just fake fake fake fake. Utter rubbish.<br />I guess it's my own fault for having such high hopes after the first book.<br /><br />honestly though, I think this trilogy would make a much better movie than book.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|My all time favorite show has been bumped to number two with the airing of this great series. Probably the best thing on T.V. right now or ever, In my opinion of course.
B004HEXSLI|4.0|This book was extremely interesting and not too complicated when talking in depth about the brain and the medical aspect of the book. It was a pretty quick read, and right as I was starting to get bored the content redeemed itself and peaked my interest again.<br /><br />Until the end I didn't feel like I was getting enough knowledge to take away with--which is required for me in a non-fiction reading--it was an interesting retelling of what a stroke does to a person's brain, through a first person account, and how the brain has the amazing ability to adapt and repair, but the true merit of this book is that it teaches the reader how to communicate within their own brain in order to achieve a peaceful state of mind.<br /><br />Taylor spent a lot of time explaining the differences between the right and left side of your brain, and how sometimes the detail-oriented left side can impede the natural calm and joy of the right side. This book actually made sense and didn't seem far-fetched when saying that you can communicate with your brain in a certain way so that you can choose to be happier and work every day to turn your overall mood away from stress and anxiety.

0307477479|3.0|This book was honestly not as great as I thought it was going to be (or hoped it would be). I have a personal fascination with novels dealing with the passing of time and the storytelling of memories, so I think I had different expectations for this book than what it actually was.<br /><br />The beginning started out wonderfully, but by the end I was sort of wishing it would just hurry up and end. Mostly because I kept getting thrown off by the overall format of the narrative. Instead of a novel, is was more like several short stories linked by characters and events; that seems to be the newest trend, but nevertheless confusing as hell.<br /><br />It certainly wasn't a bad book; every chapter had its own distinct style and character depth even though we only saw snippets of their life, and I can remember certain scenes with clear and nostalgic detail so something about it certainly left an impression on me.
B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|...It is not for everyone. Some will be (legitimately) completely turned off or bored or confused by it.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />Soderbergh is a highly formalist filmmaker, and even though sometimes he subordinates his formalism to the content of his works (as in the Oceans' movies, where even though the formalism is still very much on display, it is clearly way down below the very glossy, entertaining surface of scenery-chewing movie stars having a blast tearing through all those wonderful twists and turns of the heist plots), in other films (witness, for example, The Girlfriend Experience and The Limey) he really lets that formalism take center stage.<br /><br />As it is nicely summarized on Wikipedia, \\"Formalist film theory is a theory of film study that is focused on the formal, or technical, elements of a film: i.e., the lighting, scoring, sound and set design, use of color, shot composition, and editing.\\" That entry futher goes on to state that, \\"Formalism is primarily concerned with style and how it communicates ideas, emotions, and themes (rather than, as critics of formalism point out, concentrating on the themes of a work itself).\\"<br /><br />That last bit of the quote in parenthesis about critics of formalism is basically, I think, the place where people who don't end up enjoying Haywire are coming from. If you want to watch a spectacular action movie where you feel caught up in the plot and action in an exhilarating and sensational way, Haywire might disappoint you.<br /><br />Now, not all filmmakers are necessarily engaged in the theoretical side of filmmaking, but I think we can rest assured that Soderbergh, who has won the best director Oscar and The Palme d'Or at Cannes, or any director who has won and been nominated for so many awards is pretty deeply invested in his or her work as capital A \\"Art.\\" By this I mean to say that while Formalism is primarily considered a means of analysis by critics after films are made, it does also cross over into being a tool in an artist's bag for use during production itself.<br /><br />One of the things that I find so persistently interesting and enjoyable about Soderbergh is that while his movies often rise to that level of capital A \\"Art\\", they don't necessarily come off as self-consciously \\"arty\\" in the way that films by, for example, Lars von Trier (Melancholia, Antichrist) or Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, the Pusher trilogy) do. Soderbergh seems to enjoy walking on the commercial side of the street, so to speak, while also indulging himself in his Artistic (Formalist) pursuits.<br /><br />In Haywire - which reunites him with writer Lem Dobbs, who penned his other formalist masterpiece The Limey - Soderbergh uses a kind of skeletal genre framework (that many other reviewers have described, expressing varying degrees of satisfaction) upon which to hang image after crystalline image of fantastically detailed and playful formal experimentation with editing (shot length, juxtaposition, construction of time and space, scene transtions, etc.) , sound design (both in the sounds connected directly to the story or \\"diegetic sound\\", and in the use of music or \\"non-diegetic sound\\"), image framing and composition, camera movement, and even the fight choreography. He surely hired a professional fighter as his star at least partly with the thinking that it would give him more flexibilty behind the camera (he shoots his own movies under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) to experiment without needing to construct fights with editing in the way that many American action films do in order to make Hollywood movie stars appear to also be accomplished martial artists.<br /><br />At any rate, I have now managed to compose a review here - as I set out to do - that is completely free of any \\"spoilers\\" (indeed free of any information at all about the actual content of Haywire, which you may freely find elsewhere in abundance), while I hope to have also opened a door that some people might consider walking through when viewing this movie.sider walking through when viewing this movie.
0307949486|5.0|Like so many others, I read this book so I could go see the film and not have all of the suspense ruined for me. And I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />There was just so much detail and description of the investigation that can't possibly fit within the time constraints of film, but is absolutely necessary and intriguing all the same. At times I felt myself getting overly anxious to get to the exciting bits that I knew were bound to show up, but I could tell from the start that all the information would pay off eventually.<br /><br />I also always wanted to know more and more about Lisbeth because her character was completely fascinating to me, so I'm extremely excited to read the rest of the series and learn more about her. This trilogy sucked me right in like some kind of Swedish Law and Order; the more accelerated twists and gruesome turns, the more I couldn't stop reading.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Best show of the horror/fantasy genre since Buffy, IMHO.  I enjoyed every second of it.  From the first minute to the last.  Every episode is like a horror movie, better than anything Hollywood has come up with in a long time.  Everything I love about horror movies is exemplified by this show.  Scary as hell (the jump out of your seat/cover your eyes type).  Extremely clever and well written.  Characters are developed and the acting is amazing.  Jessica Lange has never been better, and Connie Britton is the sexiest woman on TV right now.  If you are into this genre at all you will not be disappointed.  Pick it up.  You can thank me later.
1469984202|5.0|This is magical, magical book. Not magical in the sense of Harry Potter and all that, but in the sense that the storytelling is so phenomenal that you just escape into this creative land and never want to leave.<br /><br />It took a bit to get into at first and to really understand the setting of this futuristic world, but once I oriented myself I literally couldn't put the book down. With each short novel I became more obsessed with the characters, even though there was a new narrator with every installment. Honestly, once you thought you liked this particular narrator the best, Howey made you change your mind instantly.<br /><br />It was fantastically written and made me feel like I was inside a world similar to William Gibson's steampunk dreamscapes or fighting against the authoritative conspiracies of 1984. Hugh Howey is a remarkable inspiration for any new writer, and his stories keep you riveted whether you enjoy the genre of science fiction or not.
0316044695|5.0|Everyone should read this amazing book. I opened it up and never put it down. Very inspiring and patriotic. True American heroes, everyone ahould feel blessed to live in the usa
B0052U59F4|4.0|....if the \\"Inner Goddess\\" reference wasn't so OVERUSED; I eventually skipped over them.  Also Christian told Anastasia she was \\"insatiable\\", Anastasia described Christians gray eyes and hot body about every five pages. Really.  Another negative: the British English. This story is taking place in Oregon; they don't use the word \\"bloody\\" unless they are bleeding, they don't say \\"arse\\" for their hind end; these are just two that come to mind. I had to reread many pages to understand the British. In one situation a lady was described as F'ing off; which I eventually understood it was she was mad or distraught as she left the party for her vehicle. ANYWAY~~~ if you can overlook these things you will find this a good read as well as the two books that follow. The story as a whole was worth the purchase of all three books.
1609611543|5.0|This book should be required reading for ANYone who eats! Dr. Davis does a great job of giving the history of wheat, the alterations made in it by man. It is pretty clear that wheat today is not the wheat our grandparents ate, nor any of our forebears ate for thousands of years. If you are overweight and can't seem to fight it, if you can't stop eating, if you are hungry all the time if you have an auto-immune disease, if you live in a brain fog, if you have type 2 diabetes or are \\"pre-diabetic\\", this is a must read. The author writes very clearly as he explains the many aspects of the \\"wheat problem\\" and has documented his case very thoroughly. I had already given up eating grain, this book affirms my choice!
0545265355|5.0|Very intriguing; I couldn't put these down. The first chapter of the Hunger Games made me think I made a bad purchase; I couldn't seem to 'visualize' the path the story was going to; but glad I stuck with it. I didn't get much done because I wanted to read them all to the end.
B002KKCWJU|5.0|bought these sandals last summer, first time buying a Teva product.  I've had no issues, really good fit, and they don't get an odor after a few months like other sandals.  Will buy another pair in the future.
0307594777|4.0|These were GREAT reads. I just had a hard time following the author's navigation through Sweden streets. Drove down this one, turned down that one and parked on the other one. Then walked to next one. 'One' being the name of the streets. You will see what I mean when you read them. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo seemed to drag a little at first; but then became hard to put down. Eventually I hard a hard time putting them down to get some sleep!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Purchased a Kindle fire for my 6 year old.  So of caurse he was very excited.  Only to be told when trying to register the item that it does not work in the Caribbean and that we need to return it as soon as posssible.  If their are areas in which the item is not oberational that information should be presented up front in a very conspeacuous manner.  The child was distrot.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is quite possibly one of the best family shows around.  If you want to watch a movie that keeps your interest with clever turns without bombarding the senses with bad language, unnecessary graphic violence, or awkward sex talk this is it.  There is enough humor to make it delightful, a love interest, action and mystery, every element of a great story.<br /><br />However, the message is the crowning joy of this movie.  It teaches the importance of having a good father, something that many people seem to discount.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it. it is fantastic i think every body should have angry birds I love it. and my brother loves it
B0001HLVS2|5.0|In the same vein as Captains Courageous, The Old Man and the Sea, and Carry on Mr. Bowditch, this is a classic film.  A word of advice, though, there are some bloody scenes, but not for gore's sake, but very realistic.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film, if viewed with a parent.
1451683405|5.0|Page for page, this short book has caused more deep and interesting thoughts than anything I have read in years. Highly recommended.
